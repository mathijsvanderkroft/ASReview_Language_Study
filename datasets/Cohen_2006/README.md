## Process online raw datasets
The `process_Cohen_datasets_online.ipynb` notebook processes 15 [raw datasets][2] for ASReview, and reports inclusion rates, and missing patterns and word clouds of titles and abstracts. The cleaned datasets can be found in `output/online`.

As raw datasets only have inclusion decisions, articles information (title, authors, abstract, etc.) should be retrieved from corresponding [MEDLINE][3] records by parsing the [PubMed][4] database. It takes about **3 hours** to retrieve information for all raw datasets.

The retrieval process involves a PubMed parser:

## Process local raw datasets
To avoid the time-consuming retrieval process, the `process_Cohen_datasets_local.ipynb` notebook processes 15 raw datasets in `raw`. The cleaned datasets can be found in `output/local`. There is no difference between the output of an online workflow and a local workflow.
