1,10024335,Distinct and combined vascular effects of ACE blockade and HMG-CoA reductase inhibition in hypertensive patients.,,"Nazzaro, P; Manzari, M; Merlo, M; Triggiani, R; Scarano, A; Ciancio, L; Pirrelli, A","Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are often associated with increased sympathetic activity. Both are independent cardiovascular risk factors and affect endothelium-mediated vasodilation. To identify the effects of cholesterol-lowering and antihypertensive treatments on vascular reactivity and vasodilatative capacity, we studied 30 hypercholesterolemic hypertensive subjects. They received placebo for 4 weeks, either enalapril or simvastatin for 14 weeks, and finally both drugs for another 14 weeks. Postischemic forearm blood flow (MFBF) and minimal vascular resistance (mFVR) were used as indices of vasodilatative capacity and structural vascular damage, respectively. Total (resting-stress-recovery phases) cardiovascular (blood pressure [BP] and heart rate [HR]) and regional hemodynamic (FBF and FVR) reactivity to stress stimuli were calculated as area under the curve (auc) (value x time). Compared to baseline, simvastatin reduced total (TOT-C) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) cholesterol (1.27 mmol/L, P<0.001 and 1.33 mmol/L, P<0.001, respectively). Enalapril also reduced TOT-C and LDL-C (0.6 mmol/L, P<0.001 and 0.58 mmol/L, P<0.05, respectively). MFBF was significantly increased by both treatments (P<0.001). Enalapril had a greater effect (-1.7 arbitrary units (AU), P<0.001) than simvastatin (-0.6 AU, P<0.05) on mFVR. Under stress, FBF increased more with enalapril (4.4 FBF x minutes, P<0.001) than with simvastatin (1.8 FBF x minutes, P<0.01). Conversely, the FVR stress response was reduced more with enalapril (9.1 FVR x minutes, P<0.001) than with simvastatin (2.9 FVR x minutes, P<0.01). A significant (0.001>P<0.05) additive effect on hypercholesterolemia, structural vascular damage, BP and FVR was demonstrated during combination treatment. The results suggest that inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) induces a greater reduction in vascular reactivity and structural damage in patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertension than blockade of HMG-CoA reductase.",0,0
2,10027665,Computerized monitoring of adverse drug reactions in hospitals: implementation.,,"Levy, M; Azaz-Livshits, T; Sadan, B; Shalit, M; Geisslinger, G; Brune, K","Implementation and measurement of the effects of automated computerized laboratory signals (ALS) as a tool for the detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the hospital.; This was a prospective observational study involving a total of 192 patients (199 consecutive medical admissions) over a 2-month period in a 34-bed medical unit at Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. The study involved the routine (daily) distribution to staff physicians of lists of automatic signals generated from computerized laboratory data as potential indicators of ADRs. Patient records were reviewed by the clinical pharmacology team for ADRs and to see if any were recognized by staff physicians.; 71 ADRs were identified in 64 of the 199 (32%) admissions. 27% of the ADRs were serious, 9% of the admissions were due to ADRs. 295 ALS were generated, representing 69% of admissions. Sixty-one percent of ADRs were identified by ALS. ALS was present in 58% of negative ADR admissions. 85% of the ADRs were recognized as such and 19% of the ALS-positive ADRs were not recognized by the company doctors.; The routine introduction of ALS doubled the number of ADRs detected by physicians while patients were hospitalized in the infirmary. Using the system appeared valid, easy and potentially cost-effective.",0,0
3,10027935,Glomerular size-selective dysfunction in NIDDM is not ameliorated by ACE inhibition or by calcium channel blockade.,,"Ruggenenti, P; Mosconi, L; Sangalli, F; Casiraghi, F; Gambara, V; Remuzzi, G; Remuzzi, A","In patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and overt nephropathy, glomerular barrier size selectivity progressively worsens over time and is effectively improved by inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Whether similar glomerular functional changes develop in proteinuric patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and whether antihypertensive agents can favorably influence glomerular filtration of macromolecules in these patients has not yet been documented.; We studied renal hemodynamics and fractional clearance of graded sizes of neutral dextran in nine proteinuric patients with NIDDM and renal biopsy findings of typical diabetic glomerulopathy. Six healthy volunteers served as controls. We also examined the effects of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker, both given at doses aimed at achieving a comparable level of systemic blood pressure control, on glomerular hemodynamics and sieve function. Theoretical analysis of glomerular macromolecule transport was performed to evaluate the intrinsic permeability properties of the glomerular membrane.; The fractional clearance of large macromolecules (42 to 66 Å in radius) was significantly higher in diabetics than controls, and the distribution of membrane pore radii was calculated to be shifted toward larger pores in diabetics (mean radius increased from 55 to 60 Å). Despite effective blood pressure control, none of the antihypertensive drugs significantly affected glomerular hemodynamics. Fractional clearance of dextrans, albumin and IgG and total urinary proteins were not altered by either treatment.; These data indicate that patients with NIDDM and overt nephropathy develop abnormalities in size-selective glomerular barrier function and, unlike IDDM, such changes were not ameliorated by either ACE inhibition or calcium channel blockade.",0,0
4,10028936,Overall arterial compliance in ambulatory hypertension during selective beta1-adrenergic receptor blockade and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.,,"Soma, J; Aakhus, S; Dahl, K; WiderÃ¸e, T E; Skjaerpe, T","Estimates of aortic root flow and pressure were performed noninvasively using Doppler echocardiography and calibrated subclavian artery pulse recording in 30 patients with ambulatory hypertension in a randomized crossover study with 4 weeks of treatment and washout periods. Total arterial compliance, assessed using a three-element Windkessel model of the arterial tree, increased by 42% with atenolol (50-100 mg once daily) and by 7% (p=NS) with captopril (25-50 mg twice daily). ). ). Atenolol reduced mean arterial pressure by 15%, heart rate by 22% and cardiac output by 14%, and increased aortic root flow acceleration time by 17% and stroke volume and ejection time by 11% each. Captopril reduced mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance by 7% each. Aortic root flow acceleration time, ejection time, heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output were not significantly altered by captopril. We conclude that total arterial compliance at operational blood pressure increases during selective beta1-adrenergic receptor blockade in patients with ambulatory hypertension. Although the main mechanism may be a decrease in mean arterial pressure, it should be considered whether decreased heart rate might play an additional role. The insignificant increase in total arterial compliance during angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition may be primarily due to a modest reduction in mean arterial pressure.",0,0
5,10029645,Racial differences in outcome of left ventricular dysfunction.,,"Dries, D L; Exner, D V; Gersh, B J; Cooper, H A; Carson, P E; Domanski, M J","Population-based studies have found that black patients with congestive heart failure have a higher mortality rate than whites with the same condition. This finding has been attributed to differences in the severity, causes, and treatment of heart failure, the prevalence of co-existing conditions, and socioeconomic factors. Although these factors probably explain some of the higher mortality from congestive heart failure in blacks, we hypothesized that racial differences in the natural history of left ventricular dysfunction might also play a role.; Using data from the Left Ventricular Dysfunction Prevention and Treatment (SOLVD) studies, in which all patients received standardized therapy and follow-up, we performed a retrospective analysis of the outcomes of asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction in black and white participants. Mean (+/-SD) follow-up was 34.2 +/- 14.0 months in the prevention study and 32.3 +/- 14.8 months in the treatment study among Black and White participants.; The all-cause mortality rates in the prevention study were 8.1 per 100 person-years for Blacks and 5.1 per 100 person-years for Whites. In the treatment study, the rates were 16.7 per 100 person-years and 13.4 per 100 person-years, respectively. After adjusting for age, comorbidities, severity and causes of heart failure, and medication use, blacks had a higher risk of death from all causes in both the SOLVD Prevention Study (relative risk, 1.36; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.74; P=0.02) and the treatment study (risk ratio, 1.25; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.50; P=0.02). In both studies, blacks also had a higher risk of death from pump failure and for the composite endpoint of death from any cause or hospitalization for heart failure, our two predefined indicators of left ventricular systolic dysfunction progression.; Blacks with mild to moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction appear to be at greater risk of heart failure progression and death from any cause than similarly treated whites. These results suggest that there may be racial differences in the outcome of asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction.",1,0
6,10029788,Exfoliative dermatitis.,,"Karakayli, G; Beckham, G; Orengo, I; Rosen, T","Exfoliative dermatitis, also known as erythroderma, is a rare but serious skin condition that primary care physicians need to be able to recognize and treat appropriately. Although the etiology is often unknown, exfoliative dermatitis can be the result of a drug reaction or an underlying malignancy. The treatment approach should include stopping potentially causative drugs and searching for underlying malignancies. One of the most common malignancies associated with exfoliative dermatitis is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which may not manifest itself until months or even years after the onset of the skin disease. Hospitalization is usually required for initial evaluation and treatment. In the hospital, special attention must be paid to maintaining temperature control, replacing lost fluids and electrolytes, and preventing and treating infections. The long-term prognosis is good in patients with drug-induced disease, although the course in idiopathic cases tends to be remitting and relapsing. The prognosis of cases associated with malignancy typically depends on the outcome of the underlying malignancy.",0,0

The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) is a randomized intervention study to compare the effects of ACE inhibition and conventional therapy on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension.; CAPPP was a prospective, randomized, open-label study with blinded endpoint assessment. 10,985 patients were admitted to 536 health centers in Sweden and Finland. Patients aged 25 to 66 years with a measured diastolic blood pressure of 100 mmHg or more on two occasions were randomly assigned to captopril or conventional antihypertensive treatment (diuretics, beta-blockers). The analysis was based on intention-to-treat. The primary endpoint was a composite of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular deaths.; Of 5492 patients assigned to captopril and 5493 assigned to conventional therapy, 14 and 13 were lost to follow-up, respectively. Primary endpoint events occurred in 363 patients in the captopril group (11.1 per 1,000 patient-years) and 335 in the conventional treatment group (10.2 per 1,000 patient-years; relative risk 1.05 [95% CI 0.90-1, 22], p=0) to -52). Cardiovascular mortality was lower with captopril than with conventional treatment (76 vs. 95 events; relative risk 0.77 [0.57-1-04], p=0.092), the rate of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction was similar (162 vs. 161), but fatal and nonfatal stroke was more common with captopril (189 vs. 148; 1.25 [1-01-1-55]. p=0.044); Captopril and conventional treatment did not differ in efficacy in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The difference in stroke risk is likely due to the initially lower blood pressure readings in previously treated patients randomized to conventional therapy.",0,0

We performed time-domain and rate-domain analyzes of 24-hour Holter electrocardiographic recordings to assess heart rate variability.; 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was similar during the furosemide and azosemide treatment periods, but was significantly greater in the first 2 hours after drug administration during furosemide treatment. Plasma renin activity and hematocrit levels increased and radiofrequency output decreased significantly 2 hours after furosemide administration alone. The standard deviation of all normal RR intervals and the root mean square of consecutive differences in RR interval were lower for furosemide than for azosemide (p<0.05). Furosemide, a short-acting loop diuretic, has a greater impact on heart rate variability and fluid balance than azosemide, a long-acting loop diuretic, in patients with mild to moderate chronic congestive heart failure.",0,0

Combined angiotensin II type I (AT1) receptor blockade and ACE inhibition suppress the activated renin-angiotensin system more completely than either intervention alone in sodium-depleted subjects. It is not known whether blocking the AT1 receptor with losartan improves exercise capacity in patients with severe CHF who have already been treated with ACE inhibitors.; Thirty-three patients with severe CHF despite treatment with maximum recommended or tolerated doses of ACE inhibitors were randomized 1:1 to receive losartan 50 mg/day or placebo for 6 months in addition to standard of care in a multicenter, double-blind study. Maximum aerobic capacity (V(O2)) during symptom-limited treadmill exercise and NYHA functional class were determined at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of double-blind therapy.

We have previously reported that antihypertensive treatment with the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine reduces the risk of cardiovascular events. In this post hoc analysis, we compared the outcome of treatment with nitrendipine in diabetics and non-diabetics.; After stratification by center, sex, and the presence or absence of prior cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients (age > or = 60 years) with systolic blood pressure 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg were randomized to active treatment or placebo . Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg per day) with the possible addition or substitution of enalapril (5 to 20 mg per day) or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg per day) or both, titrated to the systolic Lower blood pressure at least 20 mm Hg and below 150 mm Hg. In the control group, corresponding placebo tablets were administered in a similar manner.; At randomization, 492 patients (10.5 percent) had diabetes.

Subjects (n = 541) with a seated diastolic blood pressure of 95-114 mmHg were titrated to achieve a diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mmHg. The studies included 114 blacks and 427 non-blacks. The results of an intention-to-treat analysis of mean change from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment showed the following: 1) blood pressure was significantly reduced by all three agents compared to baseline or placebo; 2) in blacks, bisoprolol/HCTZ 6.25 mg produced significantly greater reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than enalapril or placebo, but was not significantly different from amlodipine; 3) in non-black patients, bisoprolol/HCTZ 6.25 mg produced a significantly greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure than amlodipine, enalapril, or placebo. The placebo-corrected blood pressure change was greater in blacks on the bisoprolol/HCTZ 6.25 mg combination than in whites, but this was not statistically significant. Bisoprolol/HCTZ 6.25 mg controlled diastolic blood pressure to < or = 90 mmHg in significantly more patients than enalapril or placebo in blacks and non-blacks. The difference in control rates was not significant compared to amlodipine.

13,10066961,Linear IgA bullous dermatosis in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: possible involvement of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.,,"Kano, Y; Kokaji, T; Shiohara, T","We describe a case of linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) in a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia during treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). After a drug rash due to imipenem cilastatin sodium resolved, bullous lesions appeared on the trunk. The results of histopathological studies and direct immunofluorescence studies of the lesion were consistent with LABD. However, reintroduction of G-CSF after dissolution did not reproduce the bullous eruptions. This suggests that, in addition to G-CSF, the presence of precipitating factors that can synergistically enhance or accelerate disease onset is required for the development of bullous lesions. Various cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) endogenously produced by activated lymphocytes during drug onset may have provided a favorable milieu for the onset of G-CSF-induced LABD. We suggest that patients with LABD need special attention to the nature of the cytokines or combinations of cytokines administered as therapeutic modalities.",0,0

The dose of telmisartan was increased from 20 to 40-80 mg and that of enalapril from 5 to 10-20 mg at 4-week intervals until trough supine diastolic blood pressure was < 90 mmHg. After 12 weeks, hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 12.5-25 mg once daily was added to the treatment regimen of patients not controlled on monotherapy.; Both treatments reduced blood pressure in comparable and clinically meaningful ways. The adjusted mean changes from baseline in supine diastolic blood pressure were -12.8 mmHg for telmisartan and -11.4 mmHg for enalapril (p=0.074). The mean changes in supine systolic blood pressure were -22.1 mmHg for telmisartan and -20.1 mmHg for enalapril (p=0.350). Overall, 63% and 62% of patients responded to telmisartan and enalapril, respectively, with supine diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg. Both treatment regimens were effective in lowering blood pressure over the 24-hour dosing interval, as determined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Both therapies were well tolerated; however, patients treated with enalapril were more than twice as likely to have treatment-emergent cough compared to patients treated with telmisartan (16% versus 6.5%); These results indicate that telmisartan is well tolerated and is at least as effective as enalapril in treating elderly patients with mild to moderate hypertension.",0,0

We conducted a double-blind study in 25 patients with exercise-induced ischemia. The effects of perindoprilat on stimulation-induced myocardial ischemia have been studied. 14 patients received perindoprilat and 11 patients placebo. Based on LV function, 2 subgroups were formed in the perindoprilat group: 7 patients with LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction < 0.40) and 7 patients with normal LV function. After receiving the study medication, the pacemaker test was repeated. During the first stimulation test, both groups developed ischemia. After administration of perindoprilat, increases in systemic vascular resistance and LV end-diastolic pressure were significantly attenuated (p<0.05). Furthermore, the ischemia-induced increase in arterial and cardiac uptake of norepinephrine was inhibited by perindoprilat, and the increase in atrial natriuretic peptide was less pronounced; in addition, ST segment depression was reduced by 32% compared to placebo (all p<0.05). In the LV dysfunction group, perindoprilat significantly reduced LV end-diastolic pressure by 67% and myocardial lactate production was prevented, but this did not occur in the normal LV function group. In addition, the rise in arterial norepinephrine was reduced by 74% and 33%, respectively (p<0.05). These results indicate that perindoprilat reduced acute stimulation-induced ischemia in normotensive patients. These effects were more pronounced in patients with (asymptomatic) LV dysfunction than in patients with normal LV function.",0,0
17,10073748,Cough and angiotensin II receptor antagonists: cause or confusion?,,"Mackay, F J; Pearce, G L; Mann, R D","Cough is one of the most common side effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), but is not thought to be related to losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARA). This study compares reports of cough with losartan and three ACEIs used in general practice.; Studies were conducted for losartan and three ACEIs, enalapril, lisinopril and perindopril using the prescription event monitoring technique. The patients were identified based on the submitted prescription data. Questionnaires were mailed to patients' GPs 6 months after the date of first prescription. Cases of cough within the first 60 days of losartan treatment that led to drug discontinuation were followed up with additional questionnaires. Incidence rates for reports of cough were calculated. To reduce the impact of carry-over effects, rate ratios were calculated for first reports of cough between days 8 and 60 using losartan as the index drug.; The cohort for each drug exceeded 9000 patients. Age and gender distribution and indications for prescribing the four drugs were similar. Cough was the most common reason for discontinuation of losartan and the most frequently reported event in the first month of treatment with this drug. When reports of cough between days 1-7 were excluded, cough rates were significantly higher for the three ACEIs compared to losartan (rate ratios 1.5, 4.8, and 5.7, all p<0.03). 101 patients discontinued losartan because of cough. 91% of them had previously been prescribed an ACEI and 86% had previously experienced an ACEI cough.; The observed increase in reports of cough with losartan was due to carryover. Cough rates between days 8 and 60 were significantly higher for the three ACE inhibitors compared to losartan. Confounding factors associated with comparative observational cohort studies are discussed.",0,0

19,10073846,Comparison of the effects of losartan and captopril on mortality in patients after acute myocardial infarction: the OPTIMAAL study design. Optimal therapy in myocardial infarction with the angiotensin II antagonist losartan.,,"Dickstein, K; Kjekshus, J","Patients with acute myocardial infarction and evidence of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction during the acute phase are at excessive risk of mortality. Therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors mitigates the adverse effects of angiotensin II and has been shown to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in this population. Selective angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonism with losartan, which blocks the effects of angiotensin II regardless of its source at the receptor level, may result in more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. The Optimal Therapy in Myocardial Infarction with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (OPTIMAAL) study is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel, captopril-controlled study. The primary hypothesis is that losartan reduces the risk of all-cause mortality by 20% compared to captopril in high-risk patients after acute myocardial infarction. The study population consists of 5,000 patients aged > or = 50 years with congestive heart failure during the acute phase or with a new anterior Q-wave infarction or reinfarction. Patients will be randomized to treatment with either losartan or captopril. All patients will be followed up to 937 event-driven deaths. The primary endpoint is all-cause mortality (all-cause mortality). The secondary and tertiary endpoints are sudden death (and/or resuscitated cardiac death) and fatal/non-fatal reinfarction. Based on the assumed event rate, treatment effect, and 95% power to demonstrate a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality at the 4.3% level of significance (two-tailed, adjusted for 2 interim analyses), at least 5,004 patients will be enrolled in the study and drive continues until a total of 937 events is reached (intention-to-treat analysis).",1,0
20,10075143,Study on propionyl-L-carnitine in chronic heart failure.,,,"In patients with chronic heart failure, fatigue is independent of hemodynamic and neuroendocrine changes and may possibly be due to impaired muscle metabolism. Propionyl-L-carnitine, a carnitine derivative, has been shown in previous studies to improve muscle metabolism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of propionyl-L-carnitine on exercise capacity in patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure treated with ACE inhibitors and diuretics.; This was a phase III, double-blind, randomized, parallel, multicenter study. The primary objective was to assess the effect of propionyl-L-carnitine versus placebo on maximal exercise time using a bicycle endurance test. The primary analysis performed in the intention-to-treat population (271 and 266 patients in propionyl-L-carnitine and placebo) showed no statistically significant difference between treatments. A 15 second difference in favor of propionyl-L-carnitine was observed in the completer/complier population (P=0.092). An a priori specified subgroup analysis of patients stratified by baseline maximal exercise time showed a trend of improvement in propionyl-L-carnitine patients with shorter maximal exercise duration. A non-a priori specified analysis in patients stratified by ejection fraction (< or = 30% vs. 30-40%) showed a statistically significant difference in maximum exercise duration in favor of propionyl-L-carnitine in patients with a higher ejection fraction (40 s, P<0.01). There were no security issues.; The study misses the primary objective but confirms the good safety profile of propionyl-L-carnitine. An exploratory, unbiased analysis suggests that propionyl-L-carnitine improves exercise capacity in patients with preserved cardiac function. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed by a specific tailored study.",0,0
21,10075388,Decreased bcl-2 levels in hypertensive patients after administration of lisinopril or nifedipine.,,"Buemi, M; Allegra, A; Corica, F; Aloisi, C; Ruello, A; Giacobbe, M S; Di Pasquale, G; Senatore, M; Frisina, N","In 30 patients with essential hypertension and 30 healthy controls, we measured blood levels of B-cell leukemia-2 (bcl-2), a proto-oncogene that can reduce apoptosis. Bcl-2 concentrations were higher in hypertensive subjects than in normotensive subjects. The increase in pressure due to a cold test caused a further increase in Bcl-2 blood concentrations in both hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Treatment of hypertensive patients with antihypertensive drugs caused a reduction in bcl-2 levels that was more pronounced after administration of lisinopril than that of nifedipine. The results suggest that bcl-2 levels are elevated in hypertensive patients, which may be an important factor in cell proliferation underlying posthypertensive vascular remodeling. In addition, lisinopril and nifedipine appear to be able to reduce Bcl-2 levels, with possible beneficial effects on vascular changes in hypertensive patients.",0,0
22,10077374,Tolerance to ACE inhibitors after cardiac surgery.,,"ManchÃ©, A; Galea, J; Busuttil, W","Several studies have shown that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors confer significant mortality and morbidity benefits in heart failure. Hypotension at the first dose may necessitate discontinuation of this therapy. This is more likely when the ACE inhibitor is given early after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The purpose of this study was to analyze the hemodynamic tolerance to early postoperative treatment with perindopril and enalapril in patients with renal and ventricular impairment.; Eighty-one consecutive CABG patients with a prior myocardial infarction, impaired preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on ventriculography, and moderate renal impairment (serum creatinine of 115-150 micromol/L) were randomized into three groups to receive oral placebo. Perindopril (4 mg) or enalapril (5 mg) once a day. The groups were divided into those with mild ventricular dysfunction (LVEF = 35-65%, n = 20) and significant ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 35%, n = 7). Exclusion criteria were oliguria (< 0.5 ml/kg per hour) or inotropic dependence on admission on the first postoperative day. Intolerance to ACE inhibitors was defined as hypotension (<95 mmHg systolic blood pressure or a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 25 mmHg) resulting in oliguria (<0.5 ml/kg per hour) responsive to intravenous furosemide ( 20 mg) did not respond. In such cases, treatment with ACE inhibitors was discontinued and patients started dopamine.; In the groups with mild ventricular dysfunction (LVEF = 35-65%), perindopril was discontinued in 1/20 and enalapril in 4/20 patients (P = ns). However, in the groups with significant ventricular dysfunction (LVEF <35%), perindopril was discontinued in 2/7 and enalapril in 7/7 patients (p=0.02). Our results suggest that patients with moderate renal impairment and significant ventricular dysfunction after CABG do not tolerate ACE inhibitors well if started on the first postoperative day. However, perindopril was associated with less hemodynamic deterioration than enalapril and may therefore be beneficial in this setting. rights reserved.",0,0

Patients were randomized to receive cilazapril 1 mg daily for 24 weeks (n=191) or captopril 25 mg three times daily (n=90), or placebo for 12 weeks followed by cilazapril 1 mg daily for an additional 12 weeks (n=86). . ). If patients had not responded after four weeks, cilazapril was increased to 2.5 mg daily and captopril to 50 mg three times a day. Quality of life was assessed at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks using disease impact profile (SIP), mood state profile (POMS), Mahler index for dyspneic fatigue and a health status index (HSI).; The physical dimension of the SIP averaged 7 units at baseline and improved at 12 weeks by 2.24 units in the cilazapril group, 2.38 units in the captopril group, and 1.51 units in the placebo group. The difference between drug and placebo was therefore 0.73 units (95% CI -0.86 to 2.32) for cilazapril and 0.87 units (95% CI -0.96 to 2.70) for captopril, with small , non-significant effect sizes (a statistical method used to estimate the importance of a treatment-related change) of 0.12 and 0.14. Similar results were observed for the total POMS and HSI scores. Although the QOL improved more with the ACE inhibitors than with placebo, the effect sizes were not significant (< or = 0.26).

24,10080414,Long-term prognostic significance of hyperkinesia after acute myocardial infarction. TRACE study group. Trandolapril cardiac assessment.,,"KjÃ¸ller, E; KÃ¸ber, L; JÃ¸rgensen, S; Torp-Pedersen, C","The long-term prognostic significance of hyperkinesia after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is unknown. The American Society of Echocardiography recommends not including hyperkinesia in the calculation of wall motion index (WMI). The aim of the present study was to determine whether hyperkinesia should be included in WMI when estimated for prognostic purposes after an AMI. Six thousand six hundred seventy-six consecutive patients were examined 1 to 6 days after AMI in 27 Danish hospitals. WMI was measured in 6,232 patients using the 9-segment model and the following scoring system: 3 for hyperkinesia, 2 for normokinesis, 1 for hypokinesia, 0 for akinesia, and -1 for dyskinesia. All patients were followed for at least 3 years for mortality. The WMI was calculated in two different ways: 1 including hyperkinetic segments (hyperkinetic WMI) and the other without non-hyperkinetic segments (non-hyperkinetic WMI) by converting the hyperkinetic segments into normokinetic segments. Hyperkinesia occurred in 736 patients (11.8%). WMI was an important prognostic factor (relative risk 2.49; p=0.0001) for long-term mortality along with a history of heart failure, hypertension, angina or diabetes, prior AMI, age, thrombolytic therapy, arrhythmias, and bundle branch block. In a multivariate analysis using non-hyperkinetic WMI, hyperkinesia was associated with a statistically significant relative risk of 0.84 (confidence intervals 0.74 to 0.96; p=0.01). When including hyperkinesia both in WMI (Hyperkinetic-WMI) and as an independent variable, no additional prognostic information (relative risk 0.93; p = 0.26) was obtained. Echocardiographic evaluation shortly after AMI provided important prognostic information, particularly when information about hyperkinesia was included. When WMI is used for prognostic purposes, hyperkinesia should be included in the calculation of the index.",0,0

However, the effect on SCD as a mechanism has not been elucidated.; Trials of ACE inhibitor therapy after MI reported between January 1978 and August 1997 were identified. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: 1) randomized comparison of ACE inhibitors with placebo within 14 days after myocardial infarction; 2) study duration/blinded follow-up of > or = 6 weeks; 3) the number of deaths and manner of death were reported or could be obtained from investigators; We identified 374 candidate articles, 15 of which met the inclusion criteria. The 15 studies included 15,104 patients, of whom 2,356 died. Most (87%) deaths were cardiovascular and 900 were SCDs. In all larger studies (N > 500) a significant reduction in the risk of SCD or a trend in this direction was observed. Overall, ACE inhibitor therapy resulted in a significant reduction in risk of death (random effects odds ratio [OR] = 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-0.97), cardiovascular death (OR = 0, 82; 95% CI 0.69-0.97) and SCD (OR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.70-0.92).; This analysis is consistent with previous reports showing that ACE inhibitors reduce the risk of death after a recent myocardial infarction by reducing cardiovascular mortality. In addition, this analysis suggests that reducing the risk of SCD with ACE inhibitors is an important component of this survival benefit.",1,1
27,10082500,ACE inhibitors versus beta-blockers for the treatment of high blood pressure in kidney transplant recipients.,,"Hausberg, M; Barenbrock, M; Hohage, H; MÃ¼ller, S; Heidenreich, S; Rahn, K H","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. However, the value of ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension in kidney transplant recipients has not been established. ACE inhibitors dilate the afferent glomerular arteriole, an effect that may exacerbate the decrease in glomerular filtration rate that results from cyclosporine-induced vasoconstriction at the afferent glomerular arteriole. Therefore, the aim of this double-blind, randomized study was to compare the antihypertensive and renal effects of the ACE inhibitor quinapril with those of the beta-blocker atenolol in kidney transplant recipients who developed hypertension 6 to 12 weeks post-transplant. All patients received ciclosporin as an immunosuppressant and had stable graft function (serum creatinine concentration < 220 micromol/L) at study entry. Twenty-nine patients receiving quinapril (daily dose titrated between 2.5 and 20 mg) and 30 patients receiving atenolol (daily dose titrated between 12.5 and 100 mg) completed the 24-month study. The two groups did not differ in age, gender ratio, height and weight before entering the study. Quinapril reduced diastolic blood pressure from 96 +/- 1 to 84 +/- 1 mm Hg (mean over the treatment period) and atenolol reduced diastolic blood pressure from 96 +/- 1 to 83 +/- 1 mm Hg. Serum creatinine concentration did not change significantly in either group at 24 months (129+/-8 micromol/L at entry and 148+/-19 micromol/L at 24 months in the quinapril group and 131+/-6 micromol/L at entry and 152 +/- 15 micromol/L at 24 months in the atenolol group; P=NS for both groups). At 24 months, the change from baseline in urinary albumin excretion was -10 +/- 15 mg/day in the quinapril group and 52 +/- 32 mg/day in the atenolol group (p=0.03). These results indicate that quinapril and atenolol are effective antihypertensive drugs when used after kidney transplantation. In addition, quinapril has no adverse effects on graft function compared to atenolol. The relative reduction in albuminuria observed with quinapril compared to atenolol may indicate a beneficial effect of quinapril on long-term graft function.",0,0

30,10088066,Effects of early treatment with captopril and metoprolol alone or together on six-month mortality and morbidity after acute myocardial infarction. Results of the RIMA study (Rimodellamento Infarto Miocardico Acuto). The RIMA researchers.,,"Coletta, C; Ricci, R; Ceci, V; Seccareccia, F; Rulli, F; Mazzuca, V; Putini, R L; Salustri, A; Bottero, G; Pasquale, M","The RIMA study (Rimodellamento Infarto Miocardico Acuto) was designed to evaluate the relative effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by captopril, beta-blocker therapy by metoprolol and their combination in patients with a first acute myocardial infarction : 1. echocardiographically proven left ventricular remodeling; 2. Prognosis. The second goal will be the argumentation of the present work. Two hundred fifty < or = 75 years of consecutive patients (mean age: 58 years, males = 203) with acute myocardial infarction were randomly assigned to receive captopril (up to 75 mg/day, Group 1), metoprolol (up to at 200 mg/day, group 2) or captopril + metoprolol (group 3) starting in the first 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Intravenous beta-blockers in the acute phase of myocardial infarction and all other cardioactive drugs were allowed. The effect of randomized therapy six months after admission to the coronary unit was considered with respect to: 1. Recurrence of spontaneous cardiac events and elective revascularization procedures; 2. Adverse reactions (hypotension, atrioventricular block, cough, allergy, need for beta-blockers in group 1, need for ACE inhibition in group 2) requiring treatment modification based on physician decision; Definite follow-up data were available in 226 patients and 195/226 patients (86%) had a full treatment course. In these patients (per-protocol analysis), 37 spontaneous cardiac events occurred: cardiac death = 6, nonfatal reinfarction = 9, unstable angina pectoris requiring hospitalization = 16, congestive heart failure = 6. In addition, seven patients received coronary heart disease revascularization. Events occurred in 11/67 patients from group 1, 16/63 patients from group 2, 10/65 patients from group 3 (16% vs. 25% vs. 15%, p=0.28). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed an increased odds ratio (OR) for spontaneous cardiac events in patients from Group 2 (OR = 2.82, 95% CI: 1.16-6.87: p<0.05). Elected revascularization procedures were statistically less common in patients treated with metoprolol (group 1 = 9%, group 2 = 1.6%, group 3 = 0%; group 1 vs. groups 2 and 3; p = 0.03). Intention-to-treat analysis of the overall population (226 patients) confirmed the presence of a trend towards higher risk in patients in Group 2 (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 0.96-4.59; p = 0 ,06). Adverse reactions were observed in 16 patients from group 1, 6 patients from group 2 and 15 patients from group 3 (22% vs. 10% vs. 23%; group 2 vs. groups 1 and 3; p=0.08). Multivariate regression analysis confirmed a trend toward fewer adverse events in patients assigned to beta-blocker therapy alone (OR=0.41, 95% CI: 0.15-1.13; p=0.07). In a randomized early post-infarction treatment strategy, ACE inhibition with captopril alone or in combination with metoprolol showed increased protection against spontaneous cardiac events at six months compared to metoprolol alone. On the other hand, beta-blocker treatment was associated with fewer elective revascularization procedures and appeared to be better tolerated than ACE inhibition.",1,0

Examination by 123I-MIBG imaging.,,"Soeki, T; Tamura, Y; Bandou, K; Tanaka, H; Takeichi, N; Shinohara, H; Yui, Y; Fukuda, N; Sui, O","To investigate the long-term effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on chronic heart failure, 10 patients (7 men and 3 women, mean age: 62 +/- 11 years) with chronic stable heart failure were classified as functional class 2- New York Heart Association (NYHA) 3 for more than 3 months and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45% was treated with enalapril 2.5 to 5.0 mg once daily for 3 to 15 months (mean 7 months). The causes of heart failure were old myocardial infarction (n = 7), hypertension (n = 2) and atrial fibrillation (n = 1). Radioiodinated metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) imaging, radionuclide angiography, and treadmill exercise testing were performed before and after treatment. Under enalapril treatment (1) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased significantly from 38.3 +/- 6.9% to 47.5 +/- 14.7%; (2) submaximal training time increased significantly from 205 +/- 112 to 272 +/- 120 seconds; (3) the heart-to-mediastinal (H/M) ratio of 123I-MIBG increased significantly (early image: 1.99 +/- 0.38 vs. 2.20 +/- 0.50; delayed image: 1, 86 +/- 0.44 versus 2.09 +/- 0.51) ; and (4) the 123I-MIBG leaching rate decreased slightly from 29.1 +/- 9.1% to 25.4 +/- 7.0%. The rate of improvement in LVEF significantly correlated with the rate of improvement in H/M ratio and the rate of washout after treatment with enalapril.

After dose titration, patients with DBP less than 90 mm Hg were followed for 1 year. Plasma lipids and lipoprotein profiles were determined at baseline, after initial titration and at 1 year; After 8 weeks of treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, the increase in total cholesterol by 3.3 mg/dL (0.09 mmol/L) and in apolipoprotein B by 2.7 mg/dL were significantly different (P < or = 0.05) from a decrease of 9.3 mg/dl in total cholesterol and 5.4 mg/dl in apoB levels during treatment with prazosin but not with placebo. Patients who achieved a positive DBP control with hydrochlorothiazide (responders) had no adverse changes in PLPPs, while non-responders had increases in triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles did not change significantly in the treatment groups at 1 year, except for minor decreases in high-density lipoprotein-2 levels using hydrochlorothiazide, clonidine, and atenolol.; None of these 6 antihypertensive drugs have long-term side effects on PLPPs and are therefore safe to prescribe. Previously reported short-term side effects from the use of hydrochlorothiazide have been limited to patients who have not responded to treatment.",0,0
33,10090348,Antihypertensive monotherapy with nisoldipine CC is superior to enalapril in black patients with severe hypertension.,,"Radevski, I; Skudicky, D; Candy, G; Sathekge, S; Strugo, V; Sareli, P","single-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of the calcium channel blocker nisoldipine in a sustained release sheath-core (CC) formulation titrated from 10 mg to 40 mg daily to angiotensin conversion Enzyme inhibitor enalapril titrated from 10 to 40 mg daily in the treatment of black South African patients with severe hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] between 115 and 140 mmHg, confirmed by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring). Treatment goal was a seated DBP < 95 mmHg at week 9 of treatment. This was followed by a 4-month open-label phase of nisoldipine CC 10 to 60 mg daily. Ninety-six patients had complete data at baseline and at the end of the double-blind and open-label phases and were included in this analysis. In both groups, all patients required titration to the maximum dose of double-blind medication. Monotherapy with nisoldipine CC, but not enalapril, significantly reduced both sitting and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP). Blood pressure at 24 hours decreased in the nisoldipine CC group from 179 +/- 14/118 +/- 7 to 144 +/- 16/94 +/- 10 mm Hg (P < 0.0001) versus 181 +/- - 13/117+/-5 to 171+/-17/110+/-11 mm Hg in the enalapril group (P=ns). The large reduction in blood pressure achieved with nisoldipine CC was accompanied by a significant reduction in left ventricular [LV] mass index observed after only 2 months of treatment (from 146 +/- 40 to 129 +/- 35 g/m2, P=0 ,05). In contrast, enalapril had no effect on LV mass (from 139 +/- 36 to 142 +/- 50 g/m2, P = NS). The antihypertensive effect of nisoldipine CC was further demonstrated in the open-label phase, during which the 24-hour BP increased from 180 +/- 14/118 +/- 6 mm Hg (at baseline) to 142 +/- 16/92 +/- - sank. 10 mmHg at the end of the 16-week open-label phase (P<0.0001). This effect was sustained with a trough-to-peak ratio of 74% for systolic and 67% for diastolic blood pressure, with further regression in LV mass. Reductions in 24-hour systolic blood pressure to < 135 mm Hg were associated with greater decreases in LV mass index in patients treated with nisoldipine CC. The incidence of adverse events was low in both groups and both nisoldipine CC and enalapril were well tolerated. The incidence of significant ventricular arrhythmias was also low and did not change with treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that nisoldipine CC administered once daily should be considered as an appropriate first-line antihypertensive drug in Black patients with severe hypertension because of its profound and sustained antihypertensive effect associated with significant left ventricular regression could mass and its low side effect profile.",0,0
34,10090351,Fosinopril decreases levels of the soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in patients with type II diabetes with borderline hypertension and microalbuminuria.,,"Gasic, S; Wagner, O F; Fasching, P; Ludwig, C; Veitl, M; Kapiotis, S; Jilma, B","Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are a mainstay for the treatment of heart failure and diabetic microalbuminuria. Recently, ACE-I was found to decrease plasma levels of circulating vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (cVCAM-1) in patients with congestive heart failure. Since elevated cVCAM-1 levels are pathognomonic for diabetics with microangiopathy, we examined the effects of ACE-I on plasma levels of cVCAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (cICAM-1), and cE-selectin in microalbuminuric diabetics. In addition, the effects of ACE-I on plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) were examined. Fosinopril (10 mg/day) was administered for 12 weeks to 11 microalbuminuric patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). As expected, baseline plasma concentrations of cE-selectin, cICAM-1 and cVCAM-1 were significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls (n=82; p<0.001). PAI-1 levels in NIDDM were similar to controls, while TPA levels in patients were approximately 25% lower than controls (P=0.013). Serum levels of cVCAM-1 decreased by -19% (CI: -25% to -13%) after treatment with fosinopril (p=0.003) and no longer differed from those in the control group. In contrast, the plasma levels of cE-selectin, cICAM-1, PAI-1 and TPA were unaffected. As expected, microalbuminuria decreased by -44% (CI: -65 to -22; p=0.004). In conclusion, fosinopril decreased cVCAM-1 levels along with microalbuminuria in NIDDM. This could represent a new mechanism of action of ACE-I in diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction. Whether reduced VCAM-1 expression is responsible for the observed reduction in microalbuminuria deserves further investigation.",0,0

In addition, the effect of using beta-blockers in addition to an ACE inhibitor in these patients has not been fully studied.; This retrospective analysis assessed the association between baseline beta-blocker use and mortality in 4,223 mostly asymptomatic patients in the prevention study and 2,567 symptomatic patients in the treatment study.; The 1,015 (24%) patients in the prevention study and 197 (8%) patients in the treatment study who received beta-blockers had fewer symptoms, higher ejection fractions, and different drug use than patients who did not receive beta-blockers. On univariate analysis, beta-blocker use was associated with significantly less mortality than non-use in both studies. In addition, the prevention study suggested a synergistic reduction in mortality with the concomitant use of a beta-blocker and enalapril. After adjusting for key prognostic variables using the Cox multivariate analysis, the association between beta-blocker use and reduced mortality remained significant for those in the prevention study who received enalapril. Lower rates of arrhythmic and pump failure-related deaths and risk of death or hospitalization for heart failure have been observed.; The combination of a beta-blocker and enalapril was associated with a synergistic reduction in the risk of death in the SOLVD prevention study.",0,0

Higher pulse pressure was associated with increased female gender prevalence, greater use of calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and diuretics, lower heart rate, and higher rates of reported smoking histories. Higher mean arterial pressure was associated with higher heart rate, lower use of calcium channel blockers and digoxin, and lower New York Heart Association functional class. In a follow-up period of 61 months, 1,582 deaths (1,397 cardiovascular) occurred. In a multivariate analysis adjusted for the above covariates and treatment allocation, higher pulse pressure remained an independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (relative risk of all-cause mortality, 1.05 per 10 mm Hg increment; 95% confidence interval, 1, 01 to 1.10; p=0.02). ). Mean arterial pressure was inversely related to all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (relative risk of all-cause mortality, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.85 to 0.94; p<0.0001); Noninvasive blood pressure measurement provides two independent prognostic factors for survival. Increased conduction vessel stiffness, as measured by pulse pressure, may contribute to increased mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, regardless of mean arterial pressure.",0,0

Between 1991 and 1996, eight consecutive patients (6 males, 2 females) aged 27-73 years (mean 49.8 years) with known chronic renal failure and a solitary kidney who were referred for ACE treatment were included. A 99Tcm DTPA renography was performed at baseline and 1 hour after administration of 25 mg captopril within 1 week. CRT was performed according to Working Party on the Diagnostic Criteria of Renovavascular Hypertension with Captopril Renography. A beneficial or adverse effect of subsequent ACE inhibitor treatment on renal function was determined by long-term follow-up (> or = 2 years). CRT predicted outcome in all eight patients who were subsequently treated with ACE inhibitors.

39,10093769,heart failure.,,"Rich, M W","Heart failure is predominantly a disease of older adults, and the epidemiology of heart failure reflects in large part the convergence of age-related changes in the cardiovascular system and the increasing prevalence of age-related cardiovascular disease. Diagnosing heart failure in the elderly is often difficult due to the presence of atypical symptoms and comorbidities. Likewise, optimal treatment often poses a therapeutic challenge, as medical, behavioral, psychosocial, and economic confounders are widespread. In addition, data on pharmacotherapy of heart failure in the very elderly (over 80 years of age) and in the large proportion of elderly patients with heart failure and preserved left ventricular systolic function are scarce. Despite these difficulties, a range of therapeutic options, including ACE inhibitors, digoxin and possibly beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor antagonists, have been shown to favorably influence the clinical course of heart failure in elderly patients. In addition, several studies have documented the effectiveness of multidisciplinary heart failure management programs in reducing hospitalization rates, improving quality of life, and lowering the cost of care. Currently, the three major challenges in treating elderly patients with heart failure are: (1) more effective implementation of established treatments such as ACE inhibitors, disease management systems, and antihypertensive therapies; (2) to develop effective therapies for the treatment of diastolic heart failure; and (3) to develop more effective means of preventing heart failure. It is hoped that future studies will address each of these extremely important issues.",0,0

This study was designed to evaluate the behavior of general practice physicians when treating patients with poorly controlled essential hypertension using self-measurements. Patients, most of whom were already taking antihypertensive medications, were started on perindopril or indapamide at the discretion of their physician and randomized to self-measurement (SM) with an OMRON HEM706 oscillometric device or continuation of their usual care (UC) for 8 weeks allotted -week period. This was an observational study with no specific or set treatment goals for the physician to follow. Sixty of 62 subjects completed the study, and the two groups were matched for age, body mass index, gender, and blood pressure (BP). While supplemental perindopril or indapamide resulted in a significant decrease in blood pressure in both groups during the study period, systolic pressure remained significantly higher in the SM group (seated 148 +/- 3 versus 142 +/- 3; 145 +/- 3 im comparison with 138 +/- 3 mm Hg or P < 0.05). 24-hour and daytime ambulatory systolic monitor pressures were also significantly higher in the SM group. Differences in diastolic blood pressure were not statistically significant. Additionally, SM patients were less likely to increase their medication and more likely to decrease or stop it. Physicians and patients found self-measurement convenient and useful. This study suggests that physicians' prescribing decisions are influenced by evidence from self-measurement of blood pressure, leading to an increase in real-world blood pressure associated with reduced drug use. While self-monitoring can provide reassurance about the adequacy of control when away from a doctor's office, our best evidence for understanding target blood pressures comes from large randomized trials that used office blood pressure values as the endpoint. There is an urgent need for further studies to reconcile self-measurement and office blood pressure, although each measurement must contribute to the management of hypertension.",0,0

In addition, it remains unclear whether chronic treatment with antihypertensive agents modulates AVP levels, with possible side effects on vascular tone and fluid homeostasis.; To study the relationship between plasma AVP and arterial blood pressure in a population-based sample of 534 middle-aged subjects.; Overall, AVP levels were higher in hypertensive patients (2.15 +/- 0.26 pg/mL; n = 289) than in normotensive patients (1.45 +/- 0.15 pg/mL; n = 245; P < 0.05). (Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 95 mmHg or use of antihypertensive drugs.)

The differences between the lowest and highest quartiles of AVP levels were 5.1 mmHg (P=0.03) and 2.6 mmHg (NS) for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, after adjustment for age and sex. In addition, the relationship between AVP and blood pressure appeared to be particularly strong in subjects with low renin levels (<10 mU/L; n=118; systolic blood pressure r=0.24, P=0.007; diastolic blood pressure r=0.19, P = 0.03). Specifically, patients receiving diuretics (n=39) or beta-blockers (n=54) monotherapy had increased plasma levels of AVP (2.93 +/- 0.98 pg/mL and 2.74 +/- 0, respectively, 74 pg/ml); however, this finding was apparently independent of confounding variables only in patients taking diuretics. Other monotherapies with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (n=9) or Ca(2+) antagonists (n=19) were not associated with AVP levels; The data suggest that plasma levels of AVP have a discernible relationship with arterial blood pressure and hypertension, particularly when renin levels are low. Furthermore, with the exception of diuretics, no modulation in AVP levels is attributable to antihypertensive drug use, as occurs in a population-based sample.",0,0

Because forearm perfusion was similar in the two treatment groups at baseline and unchanged after 8 weeks of therapy, glucose extraction from skeletal muscle was significantly higher in the ACE inhibitor-treated group than in the nifedipine comparator group (trandolapril: baseline 21+/ - 2, treatment 24 +/- 3 mg/dl; nifedipine: baseline 18 +/- 3, treatment 16 +/- 2 mg/dl; P < 0.05, trandolapril versus nifedipine treatment). During short-term treatment, ACE inhibition with trandolapril was able to moderately improve insulin sensitivity compared to calcium blockade, and this effect appeared to be independent of the drug's haemodynamic effect.",0,0

Investigative group of general practitioners.",,"Zannad, F; Bernaud, C M; Fay, R","Comparison of the therapeutic reach and safety of amlodipine and perindopril in patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > or = 90 mmHg and < or = 109 mmHg); A double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study.; After a 2-week placebo wash-out period, patients were randomized to treatment with either amlodipine 5-10 mg once daily or perindopril 4-8 mg once daily for 60 days. Peak-trough ratios were calculated by two different methods (global and individualized approach) from 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recordings taken after the placebo period and after the active treatment period. The residual blood pressure reduction after single-blind omission of a single dose was also evaluated with another 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Safety assessments were conducted throughout the study.; In an intent-to-treat analysis, the placebo-adjusted global trough-to-peak diastolic blood pressure ratio was 0.80 in the amlodipine group (n=47) and 0.81 in the perindopril group (n= 49). The corresponding trough-to-peak global systolic blood pressure ratios were 0.83 for amlodipine and 0.68 for perindopril. Individual valley-to-peak ratios were not normally distributed. The mean (+/- SD) individual trough-to-peak ratios (intent-to-treat analysis) for diastolic blood pressure were 0.50 +/- 0.69 for amlodipine (median 0.42) and 0.15+ /- 3.27 for perindopril (median 0.33). In the per-protocol analysis, the corresponding values were 0.50 +/- 0.72 (median 0.34) for amlodipine and 0.01 +/- 3.90 for perindopril (median 0.21). Both treatments resulted in comparable decreases in clinical systolic and diastolic blood pressure between days 0 and 60. Forty-eight hours after the last dose, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were lower in amlodipine-treated patients than in perindopril-treated patients. Amlodipine and perindopril were generally well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were leg edema in patients treated with amlodipine (19.1%) and cough in patients treated with perindopril (14.3%). These results showed no statistically significant difference in trough-to-peak ratios between amlodipine and perindopril. However, the peak-to-trough ratios of ambulatory blood pressure showed very large fluctuations. Determining the valley-to-peak ratios by the conventional approach or by an individual approach can result in different values. After missing a dose, a condition mimicking non-compliance, blood pressure was more effectively controlled with amlodipine than with perindopril.",0,0

Patients were initially randomized to receive either placebo or a single dose of ramipril 5 mg followed by ramipril 5 mg daily for 6 months one week later. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate were measured every 20 minutes for 24 hours. A single dose of ramipril reduced both SBP and DBP (p<0.001) without affecting heart rate. Long-term treatment produced a small additional antihypertensive effect, again with no change in heart rate. Cosinor analysis showed that both administrations of ramipril were effective in reducing SBP and DBP mesors (p<0.001) compared to placebo; circadian rhythms remained undisturbed. Heart rate was also not modified for any circadian parameter. However, a significant reduction (P<0.001) in blood pressure amplitude occurred after long-term treatment and may be important in preventing cardiac damage.",0,0

Since the etiology of LVH appears to be multifactorial, antihypertensive treatment should aim to reduce not only the pressor values but also the hypertrophic ventricular mass. This result can only be achieved when using drugs that can act on both pathogenetic factors. To evaluate the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy on LVH regression, 21 patients with stage 2 essential hypertension were treated for one year with either atenolol (120 mg/d orally), a cardioselective beta-blocker with no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, or ramipril (5th dose). mg) treated /d oral), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with high tissue activity. Both treatments resulted in significant control of hypertension and regression of LVH. No statistically significant difference was found between treatments, with the exception of heart rate, which was essentially unchanged by ramipril but decreased significantly by atenolol. Both drugs were well tolerated. Atenolol and ramipril play an important role in the long-term treatment of hypertension and in the resolution of hypertension-associated LVH.",0,0
55,10155301,Quality of life measurements for patients taking which medications? The PCASEE clinical perspective.,,"Bech, P","Of the many publications on quality of life in medicine over the past two decades, only a small fraction has been devoted to drug studies. The most commonly studied drug classes are within cancer, hypertension, and depression. Health-related quality of life (QOL) measures are typically applied in chronic or subchronic conditions, where the balance between efficacy (disease-modifying drug effects) and safety (adverse drug effects) is assessed by patients in terms of subjective well-being. Quality of life in this context is trying to help the doctor to listen to his patient. The components of QOL measurements are found within the PCASEE model, where: P = physical indicators; C = cognitive indicators; A = affective indicators; S = social indicators; E = socio-economic stressors or negative life events; and E = ego function or personality problems. Most variability in QOL measures results from cognitive (e.g., lack of control, difficulty concentrating) or affective (e.g., depressed mood or anxiety) components. The most specific component, of course, is adverse drug reactions, which are typically gastrointestinal symptoms in cancer therapies, and circulatory symptoms and sexual function in antihypertensive drugs. However, the affective and cognitive components also have differences within the subclasses of drugs, such as e.g. B. Antihypertensives, different weights. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors act on the affective component (depression and anxiety) and calcium channel blockers on the cognitive component (neurasthenia). In general, patients with cancer or hypertension are more reliable than their physicians in assessing their cognitive and affective symptoms, while patients with primary depression are less reliable than their physicians or loved ones in measuring changes in the affective components of their illness when they are sick . Health-related QOL measurements not only impact the doctor-patient relationship, but also incorporate a holistic approach to drug treatment by reviewing all PCASEE components.",0,0
56,10164060,Form management of ACE inhibitors.,,"Gerbrandt, K R; Yedinak, K C","In recent years, more and more ACE inhibitors have become available. Because these active ingredients are all similar, careful consideration is required to determine the specific benefits of particular active ingredients when making formulating decisions. Differences between drugs in terms of structure and tissue specificity have been identified, but the clinical relevance of these differences is not clear. ACE inhibitors are highly variable in terms of bioconversion, distribution, and elimination. Disease states such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and hepatic or renal insufficiency may affect the disposition of certain ACE inhibitors. These agents can vary significantly in duration of action, and once-daily ACE inhibitors can improve patient compliance and reduce costs. ACE inhibitors have been extensively studied in patients with hypertension, CHF, or nephropathy and after myocardial infarction (MI). Differences in efficacy between drugs are often the result of variations in study design or because non-equipotent doses were compared. It is likely that the benefits of ACE inhibitors are class effects, and it is probably reasonable to use an agent even if no large-scale clinical trials have been conducted with that particular drug. Few differences have been found between ACE inhibitors in terms of side effects or drug-drug interactions, and these factors are of secondary importance when making formulation decisions. Costs and availability may vary by agent and depend on geographic location and institution-specific purchase agreements. ACE inhibitors have shown beneficial effects on quality of life compared to other classes of drugs. Quality of life studies directly comparing ACE inhibitors have produced conflicting results. In hypertension, cost-benefit assessments usually show that the newer, longer-acting ACE inhibitors offer the greatest financial benefit. Differences in cost-effectiveness in the post-myocardial infarction patient population are usually the result of variations in protocol design, including treatment duration and non-drug costs. ACE inhibitors are fairly homogeneous and choosing between active ingredients can be difficult. Clinical efficacy, timing and cost are the primary concerns in selecting agents for inclusion in a formulary.",0,0
57,10169388,Economic evaluation of ACE inhibitor treatment of nephropathy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in Italy.,,"Garattini, L; Brunetti, M; Salvioni, F; Barosi, M","Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major complications of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), with proteinuria being the main clinical manifestation of diabetic nephropathy. Most patients who develop overt proteinuria usually progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 5 to 7 years; ESRD requires dialysis or a kidney transplant. Although an association between blood pressure reduction and delay in ESRD has long been assumed, only recently has a controlled randomized clinical trial shown that treatment of diabetic nephropathy with an ACE inhibitor significantly delays the loss of renal function and thus ESRD. In accordance with the clinical study on which this economic assessment was based, the costs and consequences of 2 alternatives were considered: (i) patients undergoing blood pressure control with only antihypertensive drugs but without ACE inhibitors (placebo group) and (ii) Patients receiving ACE inhibitor therapy (captopril group) with blood pressure control similar to placebo group. This cost-benefit analysis was carried out from the point of view of the Italian National Health Service [Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (SSN)]. Accordingly, only direct costs related to publicly funded health services were considered. The number of years of dialysis avoided (DYA) was the clinical endpoint. A time horizon of 10 years was considered for the economic evaluation. Captopril therapy dominated, was more effective and cheaper at the same time. The total cost for the captopril alternative was 21,901,625 Italian lire (L; 1993 values) per patient during the 10-year period, while the total cost for the placebo alternative was 30,352,590 L per patient. Compared to placebo, 20.01 DYA per 100 treated patients were estimated with captopril therapy during the study period, corresponding to 2.4 months per patient. The robustness of this result was confirmed by a sensitivity analysis: captopril remained dominant for both extremes. This economic assessment, requested by the Italian Ministry of Health, showed savings in health care expenses from the use of an ACE inhibitor in patients with proteinuria.",0,0

Acute infarction ramipril efficacy.,,"Erhardt, L; Ball, S; Andersson, F; Bergentoft, P; Martinez, C","We estimated the cost-effectiveness of adding the ACE inhibitor ramipril to conventional treatment in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. These estimates were based on the Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) study and complementary Swedish health resource utilization data for a subset of patients. The mean follow-up time was 15 months (minimum 6 months, maximum 3.8 years). The perspective of the analysis was that of the county governments (third-party payers) and we focused on the costs of medication and hospitalization. The marginal cost-effectiveness of treatment was estimated over 3 treatment periods: 1, 2, and 3.8 years. The cost-benefit ratios varied between SEK 14,148 and SEK 33,033 per life year gained (US$1 = SEK7.70, 1 pound = SEK12.40) for the 3 treatment periods.

59,10172139,Frequency of adverse drug reactions in adult inpatients.,,"Bowman, L; Carlstedt, B C; Black, C D","This study was a prospective observational study on the occurrence and assessment of ADRs in adult inpatients who were internally treated over a period of 120 days. Clinical pharmacists were screened for ADRs at a county hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana. Patient information was reviewed at admission, every four days during hospitalization, and at discharge. ADRs occurring after hospital admission were evaluated for causality, severity, pharmacological type (ie, enhanced pharmacology versus idiosyncratic response), and organ system involved. Reports from nurses and pharmacists, incident reports, physician consultations, patient transfers to intensive care units, and reports of serum drug concentrations were additional means of identifying ADRs. Overall, 23.1% of patients experienced an ADR, while 2.6% of the 11,702 drug exposures resulted in an ADR. Patients over 65 years of age (29.6% vs. 20.5% in younger patients) and women (26.2% vs. 20% in men) had a higher risk of developing ADRs (p<0.05). Length of hospital stay was longer (13.3 days vs. 6.7 days; p<0.05) and drug exposure was more frequent in patients with ADRs (p<0.001). Furosemide triggered the most ADRs with 36 of 244 patient exposures (14.7%). Diltiazem, enalapril, heparin, trimteren/hydrochlorothiazide combination and captopril were also frequently affected. ADRs were classified as mild (35.9%), moderate (52.6%) and severe (10.2%). The most frequently affected organ systems were the metabolic/haematological (32.9%), gastrointestinal (17.8%), urogenital (11.8%) and cardiovascular (10.5%) organ systems.

A statistically significant reduction in 6-week mortality was achieved in patients treated with lisinopril compared to patients in the control group (absolute reduction in mortality: 7.5 +/- 3.6 lives saved per 1000 patients treated). The comparative cost-effectiveness of using lisinopril, expressed as cost per additional survivor in patients randomized to receive lisinopril, was US$2080 per life saved (1993 values). The sensitivity analysis performed to examine the effects of varying the estimated absolute reduction in mortality over the entire 95% confidence interval, ranging from 14.6 to 0.4 lives saved per 1000 patients treated, showed that the Cost-benefit ratios thus vary between US$1121 and US$112 US$40,910 per life saved.

Trandolapril cardiac assessment.,,"MÃ¤kikallio, T H; HÃ¸iber, S; KÃ¸ber, L; Torp-Pedersen, C; Peng, C K; Goldberger, A L; Huikuri, H V","number of new methods have recently been developed to quantify the complex dynamics of heart rate (HR) based on nonlinear and fractal analyses, but their value for risk stratification has not yet been evaluated. This study aimed to determine whether selected new dynamic analysis methods of HR variability predict mortality in patients with impaired left ventricular (LV) function after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In 159 patients with reduced LV function (ejection fraction <35%) after AMI. At the end of the 4-year follow-up, 72 patients (45%) had died and 87 (55%) were alive. Short term scaling exponent alpha (1.07 +/- 0.26 vs 0.90 +/- 0.26, p < 0.001) and power law slope beta (-1.35 +/- 0.23 vs -1, 44 +/- 0.25, p < 0.05) survivors and deceased differed, but none of the traditional HR measures of variability differed between these groups. Among all variables analyzed, the reduced scaling exponent alpha (<0.85) was the best univariable predictor of mortality (relative risk 3.17, 95% confidence interval 1.96 to 5.15, p<0.0001), with positive and negative predictive accuracy of 65% and 86%, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, mortality was independently predicted by reduced exponent alpha (p<0.001) after adjustment for multiple clinical variables and LV function. A fractal-like short-term scaling exponent was the strongest HR index of variability to predict mortality in patients with impaired LV function. A reduction in fractal correlation properties implies more random short-term HR dynamics in patients at increased risk of death after AMI.",0,0

The purpose of this double-blind, randomized, parallel study was to evaluate whether improved blood pressure (BP) control can reverse this impairment. The study group consisted of 33 patients (aged 45 to 63 years) with poor blood pressure control who were randomized to receive metoprolol or enalapril monotherapy. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was assessed by a phenylephrine test and time and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) were analyzed using 24-hour ambulatory ECG recordings during monotherapy and after 10 weeks of combination therapy with metoprolol + felodipine or enalaril + hydrochlorothiazide for reduction of occasional blood pressure to < 140/90 mmHg. The intensified treatment reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure over 24 hours from 139 +/- 12/86 +/- 8 mm Hg to 126 +/- 8/80 +/- 7 mm Hg (p < 0.0001). BRS improved from 6.2 +/- 3.2 ms/mm Hg to 8.9 +/- 4.1 ms/mm Hg (p < 0.0001) and HRV measurements (e.g. SD of all RR -intervals from 128 +/- 45 ms to 145 +/- 46 ms, p<0.001) improved significantly during combination therapy. The changes in BRS and HRV were similar in both treatment arms. The mean RR intervals were comparable before and after intensive antihypertensive therapy (850 +/- 124 ms vs. 937 +/- 279 ms, p = NS). These data suggest that adequate blood pressure control with modern combination antihypertensive therapy can improve cardiovascular autonomic function, which may partially explain the reduced cardiac mortality seen in patients on intensified antihypertensive therapy.",0,0

Whether this is mainly due to specific drug side effects or to primarily pathogenic disorders is unknown. In the present study, 101 male patients from our hypertension clinic answered detailed questionnaires on hypertension and sexual function. Patients with suspected impotence were offered a thorough assessment and examination of the penis, performed by specialists in the urology department. Twenty-seven (27%) men had impotence. The main cause of impotence was arterial dysfunction (89%). The prevalence of impotence was related to the degree of secondary organ manifestation, represented by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification I-III (P=0.01). Intermittent claudication (p=0.001) and ischemic heart disease (p=0.005) were the best determinants in this regard. Twelve impotent patients (44%) attributed the onset of impotence to the start of treatment. A variety of drugs have been implicated in the occurrence of drug-induced impotence. Taken together, our results show that impotence in men with hypertension is mainly caused by arterial vascular changes of the penis, probably atherosclerosis. Drug-induced impotence could well be the result of blood pressure lowering itself and not specific drug side effects.",0,0

68,10193712,Recent insights into congestive heart failure therapy: focus on ACE inhibition and angiotensin II antagonism.,,"Brunner-La Rocca, H P; Vaddadi, G; Esler, M D","One possible intervention to disrupt the deleterious effects of the renin-angiotensin system is to suppress the formation of angiotensin II (Ang II) by inhibiting the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). However, ACE inhibition incompletely suppresses Ang II formation and also leads to accumulation of bradykinin. Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors are believed to promote the known deleterious effects of Ang II. Therefore, AT1 receptor antagonists have recently been introduced into the therapy of hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF). Although there are significant differences between the effects of AT1 receptor antagonists and ACE inhibitors, including unopposed stimulation of angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptors by AT1 receptor antagonists, debate remains as to whether ACE inhibitors, AT1 -receptor antagonists or the combination of both are superior in the pharmacotherapy of CHF is still largely theoretical. Accordingly, AT1 receptor antagonists are still under investigation. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors remain the first-line therapy for patients with CHF due to systolic dysfunction. However, in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitor-induced side effects, especially cough, AT1 receptor antagonism is a good alternative. In clinical practice, emphasis should be placed on increasing the use of ACE inhibitors, since more than 50% of patients with CHF are not receiving ACE inhibitors. In addition, the majority of those taking ACE inhibitors are receiving doses lower than the dose used in the large clinical trials. Although not fully proven, it is likely that high doses of ACE inhibition are superior to lower doses in terms of prognosis and symptoms.",0,0

We investigated the effect of 6 months treatment with lisinopril on endothelial function in a group of hypercholesterolemic patients. Forty patients were studied. Forearm blood flow responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography. Subjects were then randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either lisinopril, 20 mg/day (n=20) or placebo (n=20) for six months. The plethysmography was then repeated. Baseline variables between groups were comparable. In the lisinopril group, blood pressure dropped significantly [systolic: 145 +/- 4 to 128 +/- 4 mmHg (P<0.001); diastolic: 84+/-2 to 74+/-2 mmHg (P<0.001)]. Improvement was noted in vasodilator response (expressed as infusion/control arm ratio) to acetylcholine, e.g. 3.33 +/- 0.3 (pre) versus 4.45 +/- 0.48 (post) at 30 micrograms/ml (P<0.03) and also versus nitroprusside, e.g. B. 3.0 +/- 0.2 (before) versus 3.86 +/- 0.3 (after) at 3.2 micrograms/mL (P < 0.01). In the placebo group, vasodilation in response to acetylcholine did not change significantly and nitroprusside responses were unchanged. The data presented suggest that 6 months of therapy with lisinopril has a beneficial effect on arterial function in patients with hyperlipidemia. Further work should now investigate whether inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme reduce mortality and morbidity in hypercholesterolemia.",0,0

A few randomized trials and many prospective studies address the management of anemia, hyperparathyroidism and multidisciplinary predialysis care. The benefits of lipid lowering are suggested by randomized trials in patients without renal disease.; The progression of renal failure, especially in patients with proteinuria, can be slowed down by lowering blood pressure. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are more beneficial in this situation than other antihypertensive drugs. Partial correction of anemia with iron, erythropoietin, or androgens can improve quality of life and potentially prevent heart disease. Renal bone disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism can be partially prevented by early dietary phosphate restriction, use of calcium-containing phosphate binders, and activated vitamin D. Correcting acidosis could improve protein metabolism and bone and cardiovascular health. Treating hyperlipidemia could reduce cardiovascular disease. Early involvement of a nephrology-based multidisciplinary team has the potential to reduce morbidity and costs, improve patient knowledge of their condition, and increase the time before dialysis is required.; Caring for patients with progressive renal failure is complex and requires attention to detail. GPs play an important role in this effort and should be involved in all aspects of care.",0,0

To study the metabolic and antihypertensive effects of temocapril in diabetic hypertensive subjects, 30 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild to moderate hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (BP) 90-115 mm Hg] and without azotemia (plasma creatinine < 180 micromol) investigated in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, they received temocapril 20 mg (n=19) or placebo (n=11) daily for 6 weeks. At the end of the placebo run-in period and the double-blind treatment periods, the insulin sensitivity index (SI) determined by Bergman's minimal model method, serum lipoproteins, plasma renin activity, fibrinogen, and microalbuminuria were assessed. Administration of temocapril, but not placebo, resulted in a significant decrease in supine blood pressure (152/92 +/- 5/3 vs. 162/98 +/- 5/2 mm Hg; p<0.01) and an increase in plasma renin (p<0.05). . The variation in SI during treatment with temocapril did not reach statistical significance (0.95 +/- 0.2 before vs. 1.44 +/- 0.4 x 10(-4)/min/mU/L after treatment ). No significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, insulin and serum levels of total triglycerides, cholesterol, lipoprotein-cholesterol fractions or fibrinogen were observed during administration of temocapril or placebo. Microalbuminuria decreased significantly with temocapril treatment (49 +/- 10 vs. 79 +/- 17 mg/24 h; p<0.01), but not with placebo.

This effect may be due in part to a decrease in sympathetic nervous system activity, but there is no direct evidence of such an effect.; We studied sympathetic muscle activity in 14 patients with hypertension, chronic renal failure and elevated plasma renin activity before, during and after administration of the ACE inhibitor enalapril. Ten other patients with similar clinical characteristics were studied before and during treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine. Normal subjects of matched age and weight were included in both studies.; At baseline, mean (+/-SD) sympathetic nerve muscle activity was higher in the group of patients receiving enalapril than in controls (35+/-17 vs. 19+/-9 bursts per minute, P=0.004 ).

A single dose of the sympatholytic clonidine caused a greater drop in blood pressure in the patients than in the controls. Treatment with enalapril normalized blood pressure and sympathetic muscle activity (at 23 +/- 10 bursts per minute) in the patients and shifted the baroreflex curve to the left, reflecting normal blood pressure readings, without significantly altering sensitivity (-2.3+/ -1.8 bursts per minute per mm Hg, P=0.96). In patients receiving amlodipine, treatment also reduced blood pressure but increased sympathetic muscle nerve activity from 41 +/- 19 to 56 +/- 14 bursts per minute (P=0.02). Increased sympathetic activity contributes to hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease. ACE inhibition controls hypertension and decreases sympathetic hyperactivity.",0,0
78,10220232,An economic appraisal of the JNC hypertension guidelines using data from a randomized controlled trial. Joint National Committee.,,"Ramsey, S D; Neil, N; Sullivan, S D; Perfetto, E","We sought to determine the clinical costs of treating hypertension according to Joint National Committee on Hypertension (JNC) guidelines, including drug therapy, costs of monitoring and managing side effects, compliance, and costs of switching after treatment failure. ; The base-case analysis includes antihypertensive drugs from four therapeutic classes recently evaluated in a large randomized trial: enalapril, amlodipine, acebutolol, and chlorthalidone. Clinical evaluation, therapy and monitoring of hypertension are modeled with an incidence-based Markov model. Clinical inputs include drug efficacy, side effects, and compliance with dosing schedules. JNC recommended clinical and laboratory monitoring schedules are followed for each compound. Class changes occur in the event of treatment failure. Drug and medical care costs are valued in 1995 US dollars.; Although patients whose hypertension was initially treated with amlodipine achieved control more easily than patients receiving the other agents, the initial cost of achieving and maintaining hypertension control was lowest for chlorthalidone ($641), followed by acebutolol ( $920), amlodipine ($946) and enalapril ($948). Maintenance costs were lowest for chlorthalidone. For all agents except chlorthalidone, drug cost was the largest component of total cost, followed by cost of physician visits, laboratory monitoring, and class switching for treatment failure.; By adhering to JNC guidelines, a slightly higher percentage of patients achieve hypertension control with a newer class calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), but at a much higher cost than with a generic diuretic (chlorthalidone).",0,0
79,10220238,Did we learn evidence-based medicine in medical school? Some common medical mythology.,,"Paauw, D S","Medical myths arise for many different reasons. A common thread is that they all make pathophysiological sense. A good example is the concern about the use of oral cobalamin in the treatment of pernicious anemia. The difficulty of absorbing vitamin B12 when intrinsic factor is not available does not make oral replacement impossible; The dose just has to be higher. Pathophysiological concerns have also been a major reason physicians have avoided the use of beta-blockers in patients with diabetes. They worry that beta-blockers will block adrenergic symptoms and patients won't know when they're hypoglycemic. In studies looking at this topic, there seems to be no real problem with increased severe episodes of hypoglycemia in patients on beta-blockers or increased hypoglycemia unawareness. Several studies have commented on the unexpected symptom of increased sweating associated with hypoglycemia in diabetics taking beta-blockers. Another important concept behind some medical myths is over-reliance on case reports or authoritative texts. Concerns about depression associated with beta-blocker use arose from a widely referenced case report. Subsequent studies have not found convincing evidence of a strong association between beta-blocker use and depression. The strong position taken against the use of narcotics in Cope's Early Diagnosis of the Acute Abdomen is probably the reason for perpetuating the myth of avoiding narcotics for pain relief in patients with undiagnosed acute abdominal conditions. The only two studies addressing this issue did not show any problems in diagnosis caused by the provision of narcotic pain relief. Newer therapies are usually tested more closely before they are accepted, often including placebo-controlled trials to show a drug's effectiveness. This may not be the case with newer technologies. It is more difficult to assess the usefulness of a new technology in the face of incomparable predecessor technologies. Catheterization of the right side of the heart (Swan-Ganz catheter) was a technology that was in widespread use before any outcome studies were available. Multiple reports over the past decade have demonstrated increased mortality and resource utilization in patients who received right-sided cardiac catheterization. Most new drug therapies require randomized data to show effects before widespread use and acceptance. Older therapies that have long been widely accepted may not have controlled study data behind recommendations for their use, and once practice patterns have spread, it is difficult to change them. It's always good to ask yourself, ""Will this help my patient live better or longer?"" when prescribing therapy. These myths underscore the importance and usefulness of results-based research to guide physicians in their practice.",0,0

To minimize confounding, beta-blocker and diuretic treatments, the presence of clinical signs of heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction, and 16 other baseline clinical variables were simultaneously input into a multivariate Cox regression model. In addition, the same analysis was repeated separately within a high and low risk group of patients, as defined according to the need for diuretic treatment; Treatment with beta-blockers was an independent predictor of reduced risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.90) and progression to severe heart failure (0.58, 95% CI 0 .40 to 0.83) for the entire study population.

82,10221346,Effects of spironolactone and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with essential hypertension.,,"Sato, A; Suzuki, Y; Saruta, T","There is increasing evidence for important cardiovascular effects of aldosterone via classic mineralocorticoid receptors in the heart. Administration of aldosterone with excess salt produces both cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial cardiac fibrosis in rats, and co-administration of potassium canrenoate at a dose that only slightly lowers blood pressure completely blocks the cardiac effects of aldosterone. In the present study, we investigated the effect of adding a low dose of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone (25 mg/day) to an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril maleate) on left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with essential hypertension. Eighteen untreated patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension according to WHO/ISH guidelines participated in this study. Subjects were treated with either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor alone (Group I: 10 patients, 4 males and 6 females, mean age 56 +/- 18 years) or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor plus spironolactone (Group II: 8 patients, 3 males and 5 females, mean age 59 +/- 14 years) for 9 months. Left ventricular mass index, various echocardiographic variables, mean blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone concentration before treatment were similar in both groups. Blood pressure of both groups decreased significantly and similarly after antihypertensive treatment (Group I, 136 +/- 9/82 +/- 9 mmHg; Group II, 133 +/- 9/85 +/- 10 mmHg). The left ventricular mass index also decreased significantly in both groups (Group I, -10.2 +/- 7.1%; Group II, -18.1 +/- 6.9%). The magnitude of the reduction was significantly greater in the spironolactone group (Group II) (p<0.05 vs. Group I). In group II patients, spironolactone did not cause any side effects during the observation period. We conclude that spironolactone may have beneficial effects on left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with essential hypertension receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.",0,0

This was an open-label, large-scale, multi-center study in which patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension received trandolapril (2 mg) once daily for 30 to 60 days in addition to their usual care. Trandolapril was packaged in electronic pillboxes that registered the date and time of each opening. The key compliance parameters were percentage of missed doses, percentage of late doses, and percentage of correct dosing periods. Factors predictive of poor compliance (correct dosing periods <80%) were determined using multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. Two thousand one hundred and seventy three patients aged 60 +/- 12 years were analyzed. Of all patients, 37% were poor compilers; 29% of patients missed more than 10% of doses and 36% of patients delayed more than 10% of doses. Scored predictive factors for poor compliance were: age < 60 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.80 [1.49 to 2.17], p = 0.0001), the Paris area (OR, 1.70 [1 .32 to 2.19], p=0.0001), smoker (OR 1.65 [1.29 to 2.11], P=0.0001), monotherapy (OR 1.40 [1.14 to 1 .72], P = 0.0012) and baseline diastolic blood pressure > or = 100 mmHg (OR 1.21 [1.01 to 1.46], P = 0.044).

This study examines the time-dependent changes in GFR in these patients and in controls who were randomized to conventional therapy during the core phase and switched to ramipril during the follow-up study. The analyzes included 150 patients (further ramipril: n = 74; switch to ramipril: n = 76) who had at least three GFR measurements (including baseline) during the entire observation period, and a subset of 43 patients (further ramipril: n=26; switched to ramipril: n=17) who had at least six GFR measurements, of which at least three were in the core study and at least three in the follow-up study. Ramipril (1.25 to 5 mg/day) and conventional therapy were aimed at achieving diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg. The main efficacy variables were GFR and ESRF (need for dialysis). The analysis was intended to treat. Throughout the study, the mean +/- SEM rate of GFR decrease (deltaGFR) was significantly lower in patients who continued to take ramipril than in those who switched to ramipril (0.51 +/- 0.09 vs 0.76 +/- 0.10 mL/min per 1.73 m2 per mo, P<0.03). In patients on continued ramipril treatment who had at least six GFR measurements, but not in controls, deltaGFR progressively improved over time and decreased in the cohort with the longest follow-up (in ml/min per 1.73 m2 per Month ): 0.16 +/- 0.12 (at 18 months) to 0.10 +/- 0.05 (at 60 months). This rate was approximately 10-fold slower compared to patients on conventional therapy during the REIN Core study. Analysis of the individual slopes revealed that at the end of follow-up, 10 of 26 patients on continued ramipril therapy had a positive deltaGFR and an additional 10 patients had an improvement in deltaGFR on ramipril therapy. DeltaGFR improved significantly in parallel with a significant reduction in proteinuria. Changes in deltaGFR (P = 0.0001) and proteinuria (P = 0.04) were significantly different in the two groups. Baseline values and changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and 24-hour urinary urea and sodium excretion were comparable.

88,10235696,Nebivolol in the treatment of essential hypertension: a review.,,"McNeely, W; Goa, K L","Nebivolol is a lipophilic beta1 blocker. It has no intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane-stabilizing activity, but appears to have nitric oxide-mediated vasodilator effects. Nebivolol is administered as a racemic mixture of equal proportions of the d- and l-enantiomers. The drug does not significantly affect glucose or plasma lipid metabolism and appears to have a protective effect on left ventricular function. At the recommended dose (5 mg once daily), nebivolol reduces resting diastolic blood pressure as effectively as standard therapeutic doses of atenolol, metoprolol, lisinopril and nifedipine, as shown in comparative studies. Nebivolol reduced blood pressure significantly more than enalapril 10 mg daily in the short term but not in the long term, although the enalapril dose may not have been optimal. Nebivolol has an additive effect in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Standing blood pressure and/or mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure is significantly and similarly reduced with nebivolol, atenolol or nifedipine. Nebivolol tended to prevent a rise in early morning blood pressure better than nifedipine. Overall response rates to nebivolol therapy (a decrease in sitting/supine diastolic blood pressure to < or = 90 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure by 10% or > or = 10 mm Hg) ranged from 4 to 52 years 58 and 81% weeks of treatment. In comparative studies, response rates were higher for nebivolol than for enalapril or metoprolol recipients, but not significantly different from those for atenolol or nifedipine recipients. Nebivolol 5 mg once daily is well tolerated in patients with hypertension. Side effects are rare, temporary, and mild to moderate. The most commonly reported include headache, fatigue, paresthesia, and dizziness. Several studies reported no evidence of orthostatic hypotension with nebivolol. Comparative studies showed no significant differences between the frequency and severity of adverse events in patients receiving nebivolol, atenolol, enalapril, or placebo; however, the overall incidence of side effects was higher with nifedipine or metoprolol. Some recipients of atenolol or enalapril, but not nebivolol, have reported impotence or decreased libido during therapy.; Current evidence suggests that nebivolol 5 mg once daily is a well-tolerated beta-blocker that is as effective as atenolol once daily and other classes of antihypertensive drugs. It can therefore be recommended as a useful first-line alternative treatment option for the management of patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension.",0,0

German MC study group.,,"Klein, G","This study compared the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a combination tablet containing the vascular-selective calcium antagonist felodipine and the beta1-selective adrenergic antagonist metoprolol versus a captopril-hydrochlorothiazide combination tablet in a randomized, double-blind study of 109 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. After 2 weeks on placebo, patients with supine diastolic blood pressure 95-115 mmHg were randomized to receive felodipine-metoprolol 5/50 mg once daily (Logimax) or captopril-hydrochlorothiazide 25/25 mg once daily (Capozide). After a further 4 weeks there was a mandatory dose escalation to felodipine-metoprolol 10/100 mg once daily and captopril-hydrochlorothiazide 50/25 mg once daily and treatment was then continued for a further 4 weeks. At the end of the study, felodipine-metoprolol reduced supine blood pressure significantly more than captopril-hydrochlorothiazide. The mean differences in change in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure between treatments after 8 weeks were 5.2 and 3.4 mm Hg, respectively, in favor of felodipine-metoprolol (p<0.05). Standing blood pressure also showed tendencies in favor of felodipine metoprolol. The proportion of responders was similar in both groups. Both treatments were well tolerated. Two patients treated with felodipine-metoprolol and 5 with captopril-hydrochlorothiazide discontinued treatment due to adverse events. The felodipine-metoprolol combination lowered supine blood pressure significantly more than captopril-hydrochlorothiazide, while tolerability remained the same.",0,0

In this study, we measured the rates of total, oxidative and non-oxidative glucose disposal, glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, endogenous glucose production, and lipid oxidation using a 4-hour euglycemic (~5 mmol/L) hyperinsulinemic (~300 pmol/L) timer . Clamp in combination with dual glucose tracer infusion ([3-(3)H]- and [U-14C]D-glucose) and indirect calorimetry in 40 non-obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. Subjects were evaluated twice: after a 4-week run-in period and after 16 weeks of double-blind, randomized treatment with 4 to 6 mg/day lacidipine, a calcium channel blocker (n = 19), or 10 to 20 mg/day lisinopril, a calcium channel blocker angiotensin converting enzyme (n=21). Antihypertensive treatment resulted in a significant increase in total glucose clearance during insulin clamp, as well as basal and insulin-stimulated non-oxidative glucose clearance rates. In contrast, antihypertensive treatment significantly reduced oxidative glucose utilization, mainly in the basal state. The changes in glucose clearance rates were not significantly different in those treated with lacidipine and those treated with lisinopril. The suppression of endogenous glucose production during insulin clamp was significantly greater after lacidipine than after lisinopril. These results suggest that treating individuals with type 2 diabetes with either lacidipine or lisinopril has no adverse effect on glucose metabolism. Conversely, both drugs appear to improve insulin sensitivity.",0,0

Information on the occurrence of atrial fibrillation/flutter during the hospital stay was prospectively collected for the following three time periods: Day 1-2, Day 3-4 and from Day 5 to discharge. A total of 1395 patients (21%) experienced atrial fibrillation/flutter during one or more of the specified periods of hospitalization. Patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter were significantly older, a significantly larger proportion were women, left ventricular systolic dysfunction was more pronounced, thrombolytic therapy was received less frequently, and anterior Q-wave myocardial infarction was more common than patients without atrial fibrillation/flutter. The history of acute myocardial infarction and/or angina pectoris was similar in patients with and without atrial fibrillation/flutter, whereas significantly more patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter had a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary disease, and stroke. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was significantly higher (18%) in patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter at one or more of the specified periods of hospitalization compared to patients without atrial fibrillation/flutter (9%), P<0.001. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, the presence of atrial fibrillation/flutter was still associated with increased in-hospital mortality; Odds ratio = 1.5 (95% CI: 1.2-1.8), P<0.001.

Vasodilators such as prostacyclin and nitric oxide are suppressed while vasoconstrictors including endothelin are increased. Changes in the kidney include vasoconstriction, reduced glomerular filtration, and sodium retention. Effective therapy depends on tight blood pressure control by administration of vasodilators, taking into account possible interactions with cyclosporine.",0,0

A comparison of data before ischemia (before the aorta) and after reperfusion (after cardiac rewarming) was performed. The ejection fraction was compared before the operation, after the operation and after 3 months.; cardiology and cardiovascular surgery services in a general hospital.; 30 patients undergoing valve replacement surgery were randomized to two similar groups, one captopril pretreated group (CTP group, n=15) and the other captopril non-captopril group (CON group, n=15). Exclusion criteria (left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%, evidence of angiographic coronary disease or previous myocardial infarction and peroperative myocardial infarction); in the CTP group, the dose of captopril administered was 12.5 mg orally every 8 hours from 24 hours before; Using electron microscopy of myocardial biopsies taken before aortic clamping and after reperfusion, a semi-quantitative analysis of the extent of myocytic damage (MD), mitochondrial swelling (MS), sarcoplasmic reticulum swelling (SRS), and level of glycogen granules (GLY). Left ventricular ejection fraction was isotopically assessed at three time points, preoperatively (EF1), after 2-3 days (EF2), and after 3 months (EF3). Analytical data were also collected from the coronary sinus to determine creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity.; We found that, in general, cellular damage resulting from valvular surgery is low, with the degree of MS and SRS being lower in the CTP group. However, there is a stunning phenomenon in the CTP group (EF1: 54.9 +/- 6.9%; EF2: 50.8 +/- 8.5%; EF3: 57.7 +/- 7.7% ), present in the CON group (EF1 : 58.0 +/- 8.3% EF2: 60.8 +/- 10.9% EF3: 63.0 +/- 9.3%; We conclude that the cellular damage caused during valve replacement surgery is minor, and emphasize that pretreatment with CTP further minimizes both MS and SRS; However, for reasons still unknown, CTP pretreatment can induce myocardial stunning, an indication that CTP is at these low cellular damage rates has no beneficial effect, either because it is ineffective as an antioxidant or because FR formation has little effect in humans, suggesting the likely existence of other mechanisms that may elicit the occurrence of postoperative myocardial stunning.",0,0
111,10356671,Sexual dysfunction associated with antihypertensive agents: results from the animal model.,,"Srilatha, B; Adaikan, P G; Arulkumaran, S; Ng, S C","The present study elucidates the deleterious effects of three prototypical antihypertensive drugs, namely propranolol, clonidine and captopril, on erection physiology. To delineate the direct drug effects from vascular insufficiency inherent in hypertensive states, the study was performed in a normotensive animal model. Adverse effects of these drugs were estimated as changes in sexual behavior and intracavernous pressure response to electrical stimulation in the treated rats compared to normal age-matched controls (n=10, each group). Copulation studies showed significant impairment of sexual function in the propranolol and clonidine groups. The cavernous pressure response to nerve stimulation at the end of sixteen weeks further aggravated the gross impairment of sexual function in these two treated groups. In contrast, captopril administration produced only marginal changes in the recorded responses. The results of this study clearly show that propranolol and clonidine impair sexual behavior and the nerve-mediated response to erection, while captopril, which has no significant impact on these parameters, could be a better therapeutic option.",0,0

The diabiopsy group.,,"Cordonnier, D J; Pinel, N; Barro, C; Maynard, M; Zaoui, P; Halimi, S; Hurault de Ligny, B; Reznic, Y; Simon, D; Bilous, R W","Renal interstitial expansion is now considered a useful marker for the progression of several nephropathies. This study describes a multicenter, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of the effects of perindopril (4 mg/d) on renal structure and function over 2 years in 26 type 2 diabetics with proteinuria ranging from 70 to 4210 mg /d and relative preserved GFR (creatinine clearance > 60 ml/min). All patients underwent renal biopsy at baseline, but four (15%) were not randomized due to the presence of non-diabetic nephropathy. The remaining 22 were randomized (11 to perindopril [PE], 11 to placebo [PO]) and 19 (9 PE, 10 PO) underwent follow-up biopsy at 2 years. Blood pressure was controlled equally in both groups throughout. Proteinuria increased in PO patients (+1562 mg/d) but decreased in PE patients (-156 mg/d) (P<0.05). Morphometric analysis was performed by light microscopy using a Biocom computer. Over the 2 years, mean cortical interstitial fraction volume, which was identical at baseline, increased significantly in PO patients (31.7 +/- 5.3 versus 40.2 +/- 11.1%; P = 0.001), however, remained unchanged in PE patients (33.8 +/- 4.9 versus 34.7 +/- 6.6%; P=0.50). It is concluded that: (1) non-diabetic nephropathy is present in approximately 15% of albuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes; and (2) perindopril prevents interstitial expansion in hypertensive patients with biopsy-proven diabetic glomerulopathy. These results support a role for angiotensin II in the progression of interstitial changes in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.",0,0

A total of 1,247 patients (11%) were treated with ACE inhibitors. Of them, 618 patients (50%) used aspirin.; Five-year mortality was lower in patients receiving ACE inhibitors and aspirin than in patients receiving ACE inhibitors without aspirin (19% vs. 27%; p<0.001). After adjusting for confounders, treatment with aspirin and ACE inhibitors remained associated with a lower risk of mortality than ACE inhibitor use alone (relative risk [RR] = 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.56 to 0, 91). Subgroup analysis of 464 congestive heart failure patients treated with ACE inhibitors revealed that 221 patients (48%) received aspirin and 243 patients did not take aspirin. Although clinical features and therapy were similar, patients who took aspirin had a lower mortality rate than those who did not (24% vs. 34%; p=0.001). After adjustment, aspirin treatment was still associated with lower mortality (RR = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.99); In patients with coronary artery disease with and without heart failure who are treated with ACE inhibitors, aspirin use was associated with lower mortality than treatment without aspirin. Our results contradict the claim that aspirin attenuates the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors and support its use in coronary artery disease patients treated with ACE inhibitors.",0,0

Plasma tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) antigen and activity were measured at baseline and 6 hours post-dose. Acute administration of losartan, but not enalapril, decreased plasma t-PA (11%; P=0.003) and PAI-1 (38%; P<0.001) antigen concentrations, which was associated with an increase in t-PA ( 29%; P=0.03) and decreases in PAI-1 activity (48%; P=0.01). Changes in plasma fibrinolytic parameters were more pronounced during treatment with losartan (p<0.02), with a 3-fold greater reduction in plasma PAI-1 antigen concentrations (p<0.05). Acute AT1 antagonism in patients with heart failure is associated with a significant improvement in plasma fibrinolytic parameters, which is greater than during ACE inhibition. These beneficial effects of AT1 antagonism and ACE inhibition therefore appear to be mediated primarily through the suppression of angiotensin II.",0,0

The ability of sampatrilat (50 to 100 mg daily) (n=28) to lower blood pressure was compared to that of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril (10 to 20 mg daily) (n=30) using a double-blind, randomized, parallel study Group study design over a treatment period of 56 days in black hypertensive patients. Changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were determined by repeated ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) measurements. Both sampatrilat and lisinopril decreased plasma ACE concentrations after 28 and 56 days. The decrease in plasma ACE concentrations (U/L) was greater after lisinopril (-9.33 +/- 0.52) than after sampatrilat (-6.31 +/- 0.70) (p=0.0001). Lisinopril, but not sampatrilat, increased plasma renin activity. Lisinopril resulted in a transient decrease in mean 24-hour ABP (mm Hg) at 28 days (SBP = -9.0 +/- 2.3, DBP = -5.7 +/- 1.3; p<0 .01), which returned to pre-treatment levels after 56 days of therapy.

121,10373219,Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme restores hepatocyte growth factor production in patients with congestive heart failure.,,"Yasuda, S; Goto, Y; Sumida, H; Noguchi, T; Baba, T; Miyazaki, S; Nonogi, H","Endothelium-dependent vasodilation is impaired in patients with congestive heart failure. For vascular endothelium, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of the most potent and specific growth factors that is protective against endothelial dysfunction. HGF production is downregulated by angiotensin II (Ang II) in vitro. We hypothesized that HGF production is impaired as a result of elevated Ang II in patients with congestive heart failure and that in this case the impaired production should be restored with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). We studied 16 patients with congestive heart failure caused by a previous anterior myocardial infarction in whom the left ventricular ejection fraction was 35 +/- 8% (mean +/- standard deviation). Blood samples were taken before and approximately 4 weeks after treatment with ACE-I to measure levels of HGF, Ang II and brain natriuretic peptide as biochemical markers of heart failure severity. We also studied 5 control subjects in whom heparin increased HGF production 48+/-5 fold. However, in patients with heart failure, the HGF response to heparin was significantly attenuated (24 +/- 5-fold, P<0.05 vs. control). Therapy with ACE-I decreased levels of Ang II and brain natriuretic peptide and restored HGF production in response to heparin by 43+/-7-fold, comparable to the control response. In conclusion, the impaired HGF production after treatment with ACE-I was probably restored through the mechanism of Ang II suppression. This novel effect of ACE-I can contribute to clinical improvement in patients with heart failure and thus have important therapeutic implications.",0,0

Each patient's best drug was then replicated to assess repeatability. Two measures of individual variability in response were used. First, the value of the rotation was measured by the increased proportion of patients reaching target blood pressure on their best drug compared to their first drug. Second, we assessed whether responses to each drug were correlated.; Significant variability in response was noted. Twenty of the 41 patients who achieved goal blood pressure (< or = 140/90 mmHg) failed to reach goal with their first drug. Rotation increased from 22/56 (39%) to 41/56 (73%) of monotherapy success (p=0.0001); half of the patients had blood pressures of 135/85 mm Hg or less with the best treatment.

The responses to the AB pair were on average at least 50% higher than those to the CD pair; this difference was highly significant by multivariate repeated measures ANOVA; There is marked variability in the response of hypertensive patients to different antihypertensive drugs. The basis may be underlying variability in types of essential hypertension. Optimizing treatment requires a systematic rotation through multiple therapies; however, an ""AB/CD"" rule is proposed in which one of the two treatment pairs is selected first to shorten the rotation in routine practice.",0,0

Efficacy and safety were evaluated by measuring changes in seated blood pressure and metabolic parameters associated with cardiovascular disease, including triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol/HDL ratio, and glucose. Adverse events were continuously recorded. After 12 weeks of treatment, moexipril 15 mg was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure from baseline (-12.2/-9.9 mm Hg vs. -1.6/-4.3 mm hg, p<0.001). Metabolic parameters were not affected by treatment with moexipril: mean levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol/HDL ratio and glucose remained unchanged throughout the study. Fibrinogen, an independent cardiovascular risk factor, increased after placebo (+35.0 mg/dl) and decreased after treatment with moexipril (-33.6 mg/dl), but the difference was not statistically significant. Moexipril was well tolerated in postmenopausal women using HRT.

Other antihypertensive drugs did not change any parameter of heart rate or blood pressure variability.; Short-term treatment with atenolol in patients with arterial hypertension and sleep apnea syndrome is associated with a normalization of autonomic nerve control as assessed by heart rate and blood pressure variability. Therefore, the beta-receptor blockade can have positive additional effects in these patients beyond the reduction in blood pressure. However, the long-term effects of lowering blood pressure on autonomic nerve control have yet to be studied.",0,0

This fact suggests that Captopril can release histamine from mast cells.; Peritoneal mast cells were obtained from rats. Cells were cleared by Percoll. Aliquots of mast cells were incubated with captopril or with vehicle. Histamine was determined by the spectrofluorometric assay.; The results were analyzed using the Kruskall-Wallis (ANOVA) test. The study showed that captopril releases histamine from mast cells. The process depends on the presence of Ca2+ in the incubation environment. As a mast cell membrane stabilizer, sodium cromoglycate inhibits the action of captopril.; Our results suggest that allergic side effects of captopril may be associated with histamine release from mast cells.",0,0

Because ACE inhibition is effective in reducing heart failure progression, it could be particularly beneficial in post-AMI diabetics.; The study is a retrospective analysis using data from the Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of trandolapril in 1,749 patients with AMI and ejection fraction < or = 35%. The mean follow-up time was 26 months.; A history of diabetes was identified in 237 (14%) of the 1,749 patients.

The Losartan Heart Failure Survival Study--ELITE II (currently ongoing) is a double-blind, randomized clinical trial being conducted in 45 countries at 288 sites. ELITE II formally tests the hypotheses that losartan will reduce all-cause mortality (primary endpoint) and sudden cardiac death and/or resuscitated cardiac arrest (secondary endpoint) compared to captopril. In addition, all-cause mortality and/or hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality and/or hospitalizations are evaluated. The study has 90% power to detect a 25% treatment difference in all-cause mortality (event-driven, 510 deaths).

Trandolapril Cardiac Assessment.,,"Torp-Pedersen, C; KÃ¸ber, L","The survival benefit from the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with acute myocardial infarction is usually presented as risk ratio and lives saved per 1000 people treated. A more meaningful way of presenting the magnitude of the benefit would be the increase in life expectancy, but this approach has not been possible until now due to limited data on long-term outcomes. Our aim was to calculate the effect of trandolapril on life expectancy using follow-up data from the Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) Study.; The TRACE study previously demonstrated a significant survival benefit with trandolapril in patients with impaired left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction who were treated for at least 2 years. We assessed the survival status of all patients in the TRACE study in June 1998, by which time they had been followed for at least 6 years. We estimated life expectancy as mean lifespan, which was the time by which 50% of the patients had died. The change in life expectancy is expressed as the change in mean life expectancy. The analysis was intended to treat.; Patient life expectancy was 4.6 years for placebo-treated patients versus 6.2 years for trandolapril-treated patients. Thus, the median lifespan was increased by 15.3 months or 27% (95% CI 7 to 51) in patients receiving trandolapril. Analysis of post-study follow-up showed no decrease in this benefit over the course of double-blind treatment; continued use of trandolapril was recommended at study completion; In patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, long-term treatment with an ACE inhibitor during the critical period after myocardial infarction is associated with a substantial increase in life expectancy.",1,1

Drug dose was titrated and a thiazide diuretic was added, if necessary, to achieve a target blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg. Both drugs lowered blood pressure significantly, but the effect of lisinopril was greater (P<0.009): Mean day and night blood pressure fell from 152/98 and 135/84 mm Hg to 133/85 and 118/74, respectively mm Hg enalapril and to 129/83 and 116/70 mmHg with lisinopril. The blood pressure goal was achieved with an average dose of enalapril 18 mg with hydrochlorothiazide 8 mg and with lisinopril 17 mg in combination with a diuretic 6 mg. The trough:peak ratio values calculated after Fourier analysis of ABPM data in individual patients were independent of drug dose. The combination with the diuretic produced slightly higher trough-to-peak ratios than ACE inhibitor monotherapy, but the difference was not significant. The median trough:peak ratio for patients receiving enalapril-based therapy was 0.48 and 0.65 for lisinopril-based therapy (n=28, p<0.005). A significant correlation was found between the trough:peak ratio and changes in mean daily arterial pressure (MAP; Spearman r = 0.43) and nocturnal MAP (r = 0.66). When 24-hour blood pressure was taken starting 24 hours after the last drug intake, both ACE inhibitors still had a significant antihypertensive effect (P<0.001) that was similar for both drugs.

Eprosartan Study Group.,,"Elliott, W J","The effects of a new angiotensin receptor antagonist, eprosartan (200 or 300 mg bid) and enalapril (5-20 mg uid) on cough and blood pressure were compared in a 26-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, international study with 528 patients with hypertension. Up-titration of doses was based on clinical blood pressure measurements during the first 12 weeks, after which hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day) could be added. Cough frequency and intensity was assessed by a standardized questionnaire administered at each clinic visit. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a persistent, dry cough that was not due to upper respiratory tract infection; secondary endpoints were change in sitting diastolic blood pressure and overall frequency of cough. During the first 12 weeks of double-blind therapy, treatment with enalapril was associated with a 3.45-fold greater risk of definitive cough (14/261 vs. 4/259, p=0.018). The overall incidence of cough (from spontaneous patient reporting or investigator observation) was also higher with enalapril than with eprosartan. Both agents significantly reduced blood pressure compared to baseline, although the eprosartan-treated group had a slightly higher response rate (defined as seated diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg or at least a 10 mm Hg reduction from baseline), both at the end of treatment titration (70.3% vs 62.6%, P<0.05) and at 26 weeks (81.7% vs 73.5%, P=0.018).

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the importance of a history of HBP on the clinical efficacy of early treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor zofenopril in patients with anterior AMI. We summarize the results of a post-hoc analysis of data from the Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long-Term Evaluation (SMILE) study, which randomized to assess the efficacy of zofenopril administered to patients within 24 hours of onset of symptoms with anterior AMI who did not undergo thrombolysis. Of 1441 patients enrolled in the study, 565 (39.2%) had a history of HBP. The median follow-up was 12 months and the main endpoints were 6-week combined incidence of death and severe congestive heart failure (CHF) and 1-year mortality. After 6 weeks of treatment with zofenopril, the relative risk of death or severe CHF was 0.60 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45-0.81; 2P<0.05) in the hypertensive group and 0.89 (0.74-1.08; 2P = 0.05). 62) for normotensive patients, while the 1-year risk of mortality was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.89; 2P < 0.05) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.52-1 .17; 2P = 0.22). The 6-week prevalence of mild to moderate CHF was also significantly reduced by zofenopril in the hypertensive population (14.1% vs. 9.4%; 2P<0.05).

At the end of each treatment period, forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography during an intrabrachial infusion of bradykinin before and after an intrabrachial infusion of Hoe-140 (a potent, selective and long-acting bradykinin antagonist). Bradykinin caused a strong vasodilation after enalapril (peak 357 +/- 67%) and less after losartan (peak 230 +/- 46%). Despite this, Hoe-140 had no discernible effects after enalapril or losartan. Similarly, this was despite the finding that Hoe-140 significantly reduced vasodilation on bradykinin after enalapril (peak, 192 +/- 35%) and losartan (peak, 66 +/- 13%); Inhibition of endogenous bradykinin degradation does not appear to contribute to the effects of ACE inhibition or AT(1) antagonism in the forearm of patients with resting heart failure, despite the very apparent effects of ACE inhibition compared to AT(1) antagonism to exogenous bradykinin.",0,0

Discontinuation of captopril treatment did not significantly decrease this NaCl sensitivity. In untreated WKY rats, the high-NaCl diet did not alter mean arterial pressure, but in WKY rats treated with captopril for life, the high-NaCl diet induced a rapid increase in arterial pressure.

Of the 1,749 patients enrolled in the TRACE study, 1,577 had sinus rhythm on the ECG recorded at randomization. Of these patients, 790 were randomized to receive trandolapril and 787 to receive placebo. The groups differed only slightly in terms of baseline characteristics. A total of 64 patients developed atrial fibrillation during the 2 to 4 year follow-up period. Significantly more patients developed atrial fibrillation in the placebo group than in the trandolapril group, 5.3% (n=42) versus 2.8% (n=22), P<0.05. Cox's multivariate regression analysis, adjusted for key baseline characteristics, revealed that treatment with trandolapril significantly reduced the risk of developing atrial fibrillation (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.76; p<0, 01). The results of the present study show that treatment with trandolapril reduces the incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after an acute myocardial infarction.",0,0
153,10423601,Usefulness of moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide in moderate essential hypertension.,,"White, W B; Koch, B; Stimpel, M","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor moexipril alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide versus hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy in patients with stage II and III essential hypertension. This was a double-blind, randomized, multicentre study evaluating moexipril (15 and 30 mg once daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 and 50 mg once daily), and drug combinations (15 mg moexipril/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 30 mg moexipril) /50 mg hydrochlorothiazide) in 272 hypertensive patients whose seated diastolic blood pressure (BP) was 100 to 114 mm Hg. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in sitting diastolic blood pressure at the end of the dosing period. Secondary measures of effectiveness included changes in systolic blood pressure and standing blood pressure. The lower doses of moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide reduced diastolic blood pressure similarly (-8.0 +/- 1.4 versus -8.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg; p=NS), as did the higher doses of the Monotherapy (moexipril, -9.7 +/- 1.2 mm Hg vs. hydrochlorothiazide, -11.0 +/- 1.2 mm Hg, p=NS). Combinations of moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide reduced diastolic blood pressure significantly more than either monotherapy (lower doses, -16.0 +/- 1.4 mm Hg; p<0.001; higher doses, -17.9 +/- 1.2 mm Hg ;p<0.001). Similar trends were observed for systolic blood pressure. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 0% in patients on moexipril monotherapy and 3% to 5% in patients on diuretics or combination therapy. These data show that moexipril 15 and 30 mg once daily reduces blood pressure similar to hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage II and III hypertension. There is also an additive effect when the two agents are combined that lowers blood pressure more significantly than either monotherapy.",0,0
154,10423609,Quinapril in patients with congestive heart failure: controlled trial compared to captopril.,,"Acanfora, D; Furgi, G; Trojano, L; Picone, C; Iannuzzi, G L; Rossi, M; Papa, A; Rengo, C; Rengo, F","After a 2-week placebo wash-out run-in period, 131 patients with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Classes II to III) and left ventricular ejection fraction </=40% were randomized to treatment for a period of 4 weeks with 10 mg quinapril once daily or 12.5 mg captopril twice daily. At the end of this period, doses were titrated based on physician judgment to quinapril 20 mg once daily or captopril 25 mg twice daily if there were no serious side effects and blood pressure was not less than 110/70 mmHg. Clinical signs of heart failure were significantly reduced by both drugs at the end of a 12-week treatment period. At baseline, 23 (35%) of the 65 patients taking quinapril and 27 (41%) of the 66 patients taking captopril were in NYHA functional class III, while at the end of the study only 4 (6%) of patients in the quinapril group and 14 (22%; p<0.05 vs. quinapril) patients in the captopril group were classified as NYHA Class III. Both drugs had a positive effect on echocardiographic parameters. There was a statistically significant increase in exercise duration in both treatment groups (quinapril, 6.2 +/- 1.8 versus 7.8 +/- 1.9 minutes, p<0.001; captopril, 5.9 +/- 1.9 versus 7.1 +/- 2.3 minutes, p<0.001). One patient in the quinapril group died suddenly during the study and two patients in the captopril group discontinued the study due to persistent dry cough. No patient in the quinapril group reported any side effects. Three patients in the captopril group suffered from moderate dry cough, one from taste blindness and another from unstable angina. The safety of the tested drugs was confirmed by laboratory tests. Quinapril was as effective as captopril in reducing signs and symptoms of heart failure and improving left ventricular function and exercise capacity with few side effects.",1,1
155,10423659,Comparison of telmisartan with lisinopril in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.,,"Neutel, J M; Frishman, W H; Oparil, S; Papademitriou, V; Guthrie, G","In this study, telmisartan, a new angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist, given as monotherapy and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), was compared with lisinopril as monotherapy and in combination with HCTZ. This 52-week, randomized, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, dose-titration study in 578 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (mean diastolic blood pressure [DBP] >/= 95 mm Hg) compared the efficacy and safety of telmisartan (p = 385) with lisinopril (n = 193). The dosage could be increased for both telmisartan (40 --> 80 --> 160 mg) and lisinopril (10 --> 20 --> 40 mg) at each of the first 2 monthly visits if DBP control ( < 90 mm Hg) had not been detected. Once DBP control was established, patients entered the 48-week maintenance phase. During this period, study drug dose was fixed, although open-label HCTZ was added at 12.5 mg or 25 mg as needed to regain DBP control. At the end of the titration phase, DBP control was achieved by 67% and 63% of telmisartan and lisinopril patients on monotherapy, respectively. At the end of the maintenance phase, supine DBP was controlled in 83% and 87% of telmisartan and lisinopril patients, respectively, with a reduction in systolic blood pressure above DBP of 23.8/16.6 mmHg for telmisartan and 19.9 /15.6 mmHg for lisinopril. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurred in fewer telmisartan-treated patients (28%) than lisinopril-treated patients (40%; p=0.001). Significantly fewer patients (p=0.018) receiving telmisartan experienced treatment-emergent cough (3% vs. 7%), and cough was significantly less likely (p=0.007) to discontinue telmisartan than those receiving lisinopril (0 .3% vs. 3.1%). Two cases of angioedema were also observed, both in the lisinopril group. The selective AT(1) receptor antagonist telmisartan is highly effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, both as monotherapy and in combination with HCTZ, and is at least comparable in efficacy to lisinopril, with a tolerability profile that may offer advantages in terms of a reduced incidence of adverse events.",0,0
156,10424316,Effects of captopril and enalapril on the electroencephalogram and cognitive performance in healthy subjects.,,"Ebert, U; Kirch, W","Captopril and enalapril have been reported to affect cognitive function and quality of life in hypertensive patients.; The effects of captopril (12.5 mg and 25 mg) and enalapril (5 mg and 10 mg) administered during 7-day periods on the electroencephalogram (EEG), cognitive functions and subjective ratings were studied in healthy men.; Neither captopril nor enalapril affected EEG and cognitive function compared to placebo. Captopril 12.5 mg decreased subjective activity compared to placebo. Enalapril did not change the subjective ratings. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly lower after administration of captopril 25 mg, while blood pressure was unaffected by enalapril compared to placebo.; Our results suggest that the central effects of captopril and enalapril in young healthy men were small and not constant.",0,0
157,10426836,Aspirin impairs exercise performance and pulmonary gas exchange in heart failure patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Guazzi, M; Pontone, G; Agostoni, P","Lung function abnormalities are implicated in the development of physical disability in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Impaired pulmonary gas transfer is one such abnormality. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve carbon monoxide diffusion and exercise capacity, an effect that appears to be mediated by prostaglandin activation since it is inhibited by cyclooxygenase blockade with aspirin. This raises the possibility that aspirin may interfere with lung function and exercise capacity in CHF, at least in those patients taking ACE inhibitors. This study aimed to examine this hypothesis.; A dose of 325 mg of aspirin was administered daily for 8 weeks to 26 consecutive patients with primary dilated cardiomyopathy (New York Heart Association Class II or III) whose current outpatient antifailure therapy was included (Group 1, 18 cases) or not included (Group 2 , 8 cases) an ACE inhibitor in addition to digoxin and furosemide. During the study, ACE inhibition was continued in group 1 with daily dosing of enalapril 20 mg; Tests repeated after 8 weeks proved that aspirin was harmful in group 1. Compared to run-in, resting carbon dioxide, maximal exercise oxygen uptake (peak VO(2)), and tidal volume were reduced in this group; the ratio of exercise minute ventilation to carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO(2)) was increased and its variability was inversely related to that of peak VO(2). Similar results were not observed in Group 2; however, after this part of the study was completed and enalapril was included in the current therapeutic regimen, an inhibitory effect of aspirin on carbon dioxide, peak VO(2), peak tidal volume, and VE/VCO(2) at 1 liter levels became evident and was similar to that observed in Group 1; Aspirin does not affect ventilatory efficiency and peak VO(2) in patients with CHF not taking ACE inhibitors, but it does worsen pulmonary diffusion of carbon monoxide, VO(2), and ventilatory response to exercise in the presence of ACE -Inhibition. This may be relevant in patients with CHF due to ischemic heart disease. Whether this also applies to smaller aspirin doses was not investigated in this study.",0,0

Various etiological factors have been implicated, including drugs, total parenteral nutrition, sepsis, pregnancy, graft-versus-host disease, and systemic disorders such as sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and Hodgkin's disease. The pathogenesis of cholestasis is unclear, and several mechanisms have been proposed without convincing evidence that any of these play a role in clinical cholestasis. Despite the uncertainty about the pathophysiology of intrahepatic cholestasis, several forms of therapy have been used. Ursodeoxycholic acid can relieve itching and lethargy and, in some cases, change the course of the disease. If cholestasis persists, supportive therapy is important to maintain optimal physical and nutritional well-being. In patients with advanced liver disease associated with hepatocellular failure, liver transplantation is the only viable option.",0,0

In REIN shift 1 reported here, 24-h proteinuria was 1 g or more but less than 3 g per 24 h; In stratum 1 of this double-blind study, 186 patients were randomized to receive ramipril or a control group (placebo plus conventional antihypertensive therapy) aimed at achieving a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg. The primary endpoints were change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and time to ESRF or overt proteinuria (> or = 53 g/24 h). The mean follow-up time was 31 months.; The decrease in GFR per month was not significantly different (ramipril 0.26 [SE 0.05] ml per minute per 1.73 m2, control 0.29 [0.06]). Progression to ESRF was significantly less frequent in the ramipril group (9/99 vs. 18/87) for a relative risk (RR) of 2.72 (95% CI 1.22-6.08); also progression to overt proteinuria (15/99 vs. 27/87, RR 2.40 [1.27-4.52]). Patients with a baseline GFR of 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or less and proteinuria of 1.5 g/24 h or more had faster progression and benefited the most from ramipril treatment. Proteinuria decreased by 13% in the ramipril group and increased by 15% in the control group. Cardiovascular events were similar. As expected, the GFR decline rate and ESRF frequency in stratum 1 were much lower than in stratum 2; In non-diabetic nephropathies, ACE inhibition confers renoprotection even in patients with non-nephrotic proteinuria.",1,0

163,10445870,Peculiarities in the treatment of diabetic hypertension.,,"GuzmÃ¡n, C B; Sowers, J R","Patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased prevalence of hypertension and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary and cerebrovascular disease. A person's risk of developing CVD is much greater when both diseases coexist and is further magnified by their frequent association with dyslipidemia, coagulation, platelet and endothelial abnormalities. Metabolic abnormalities commonly associated with hypertension are insulin resistance, increased coagulation, and decreased fibrinolytic activity. Drug treatment of hypertension in diabetics is fraught with potential difficulties, including altered drug efficacy, potential side effects, deterioration in glycemic control, and impaired lipid metabolism. Because hypertension is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in diabetes, despite these difficulties, it should be recognized and treated early and aggressively.

164,10446945,The long-term outcome of patients with IgA nephropathy treated with fish oil in a controlled study. Mayo Nephrology Collaborative Group.,,"Donadio, J V; Grande, J P; Bergstralh, E J; Dart, R A; Larson, T S; Spencer, D C","In a multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, 2-year clinical trial, fish oil supplementation was previously reported to delay the progression of kidney disease in patients with IgA nephropathy. The aim of this study was to determine the long-term effect of fish oil treatment on renal progression in observations on the study cohort of 106 patients beyond the 2-year study. Renal function was assessed by serial serum creatinine and 24-hour urine protein measurements. Vital status, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and BP status and treatment after completion of the 2-year study were determined. As in the study, the primary endpoint was an increase in serum creatinine of 50% or more and the secondary endpoint was ESRD. After a mean follow-up of 6.4 years, 46 patients - 17 in the fish oil group versus 29 in the placebo group - achieved the primary endpoint (p=0.002) and 27 patients - eight in the fish oil group versus 19 in the placebo group developed ESRD (P = 0.009). At the end of the 2-year study, 75 patients (45 fish oil, 30 placebo) remained at risk for the primary endpoint. The double-blind portion of the study, which allowed physicians to stop taking supplements, switch patients originally treated with placebo to fish oil, and continue fish oil in patients originally treated with fish oil, also ended at this point. A significantly greater number of patients without supplemented placebo developed the primary endpoint (p=0.02) and ESRD (p=0.003) compared to patients supplemented with long-term fish oil. Conversely, more fish oil-supplemented patients had stable renal function than patients not supplemented (P=0.02). By design, the BP control, which was treated primarily with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, was the same in the fish oil and placebo groups. Proteinuria was slightly reduced in both groups. It is concluded that early and prolonged treatment with fish oil slows renal progression in high-risk patients with IgA nephropathy.",0,0

Relatively few direct comparative studies between fixed-dose combinations and first-line monotherapies for hypertension have been published. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of different first-line monotherapies and the fixed combination amlodipine/benazepril. The results of the meta-analysis were used to compare the efficacy and safety of first-line amlodipine/benazepril monotherapies. The meta-analysis included 82 studies with 110 treatment groups (cohorts). The study compared nine different monotherapies and one combination therapy (amlodipine/benazepril). Of the 82 studies, 22 were placebo-controlled and 60 were active-treatment-controlled. The mean absolute decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) ranged from 9.7 to 13.3 mm Hg, with verapamil having the greatest effect and captopril the least effect (13.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg and .9.7 +/- 2.9 mmHg). When studies were weighted by sample size, atenolol, verapamil, lisinopril, and amlodipine/benazepril showed the largest BP effect. When the studies were weighted for variance, amlodipine/benazepril and atenolol showed the greatest BD effect. The percentage of patients controlled on therapy ranged from 54% to 79%. Lisinopril and amlodipine/benazepril showed the greatest percentage controlled. The overall incidence of adverse reactions ranged from 12.1% to 41.8%, with lisinopril having the lowest incidence and nifedipine the highest. The overall incidence of adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation ranged from 1.3% to 10.7%, with amlodipine/benazepril having the lowest incidence and nifedipine the highest incidence. The results of the meta-analysis show that amlodipine/benazepril provides greater than average blood pressure reduction with a below average incidence of overall adverse reactions and the lowest incidence of adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation. The fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/benazepril achieves its goal of effectively lowering blood pressure with a minimum of significant side effects.",0,0

Patients (n=118) were randomized into an 8-week, double-blind titration period to initially receive a total oral daily dose of eprosartan 400 mg given twice daily or a total oral daily dose of enalapril 10 mg given once at weeks 2 and 4, respectively 600 and 800 mg daily given twice daily and that of enalapril increased to 20 and 40 mg daily given once at weeks 2 and 4 if sitDBP was > or = 90 mmHg. If blood pressure remained uncontrolled on maximal doses of eprosartan or enalapril at week 6, HCTZ 25 mg once daily was added to the treatment regimen. Patients whose blood pressure was considered medically acceptable by the investigator at week 8 entered a 2-week maintenance phase with the last dose used in the titration phase. The primary measure of effectiveness was the difference between treatments in mean reduction in sitDBP from baseline at the end of the study. Eprosartan and enalapril caused a similar decrease in sitDBP at the end of the study. The mean change in sitDBP at the end of the study was -20.1 mmHg in the eprosartan group versus -16.2 mmHg in the enalapril group. However, eprosartan produced significantly greater reductions in systolic blood pressure (sitSBP and staSBP, respectively) than enalapril in both sitting and standing positions. The mean decrease in sitSBP was 29.1 mmHg for eprosartan compared to 21.1 mmHg for enalapril (p=0.025). The mean reduction in staSBP was 27.8 mmHg for eprosartan compared to 20.0 mmHg for enalapril (p=0.032). At the end of the study, the response rate (sitDBP < 90 mmHg or decrease from baseline by at least 15 mmHg) was 69.5% in the eprosartan group and 54.2% in the enalapril group. The proportion of patients in each treatment group who required additional HCTZ was similar. Eprosartan was well tolerated; the overall incidence of side effects was comparable to that in the enalapril group.

Acute infarction ramipril efficacy.,,"Spargias, K; Ball, S; Hall, A","After an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), patients with a history of arterial hypertension (AH) have a poorer prognosis than normotensive patients. It is not known whether this undesirable risk is favorably modulated by treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We evaluated the prognostic value of prior hypertension in post-AMI patients receiving ACE inhibitor therapy.; We retrospectively analyzed data from the AIRE study (randomized, placebo-controlled study of ramipril in 2006 post-AMI patients with clinical heart failure). A history of AH was present in 28% of patients. We examined the prognostic value of prior hypertension separately in patients treated with placebo and ramipril, and also the effect of ramipril on clinical outcomes, depending on whether or not there was a history of AH.; Prior hypertension was a significant predictor of poor prognosis in placebo (P) treated patients (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.97, P=0.005) but not in ramipril (R ) treated patients (1.17, 0.84 to 1.61). , P=0.34).

171,10456379,"Drug-induced cognitive disorders in the elderly: incidence, prevention, and management.",,"Gray, S L; Lai, K V; Larson, E B","The etiology of cognitive impairment is multifactorial; However, medications are an important cause of delirium and dementia. Several factors may increase the risk of drug-induced cognitive disorders in the elderly, including neurotransmitter (eg, acetylcholine) imbalances, age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and high drug use. Almost any drug can cause cognitive impairment in susceptible individuals; however, certain classes are more commonly affected. Benzodiazepines, opioids, anticholinergics, and tricyclic antidepressants are probably the worst offenders. Older antihypertensive drugs (reserpine, clonidine) have negative effects on cognition; however, large clinical trials in the elderly indicate that commonly used agents [e.g. thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers (amiodipine, diltiazem), ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalapril), and beta-blockers (atenolol)] have minimal effects on cognition. Newer antidepressants such as selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and reversible monoamine oxidase A inhibitors do not have adverse effects on cognition. Although some drugs have been shown in research studies to have a low risk of cognitive impairment, the risk may be increased in frail older adults who take multiple drugs, and each case should be carefully evaluated. Identifying drug-induced cognitive impairment is critical for early detection and resolution of symptoms. Preventive strategies that focus on avoiding high-risk drugs whenever possible, adjusting doses for age-related changes, and close follow-up can prevent these disorders.",0,0

175,10467219,"Safety and Efficacy of Eprosartan, a Novel Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker.",,"Shusterman, N H","Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been used extensively in the treatment of hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases. However, this treatment approach is limited by a lack of specificity and the continued production of angiotensin II by other pathways. Angiotensin II receptor antagonism offers the potential for improved hypertension control by providing more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system than inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme without bradykinin-related effects. Eprosartan is the only competitive non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole angiotensin II receptor antagonist clinically available and is highly selective for the AT1 receptor subtype. Clinical trials have shown that eprosartan is effective in lowering blood pressure when given once daily in patients with hypertension. Over the recommended dose range of 600 to 1200 mg once daily, eprosartan is effective in patients with all degrees of hypertension, regardless of age, gender or race. In addition, the tolerability profile of eprosartan is comparable to that of placebo and there are no known clinically relevant drug interactions. A number of large clinical trials are underway or planned to determine which of the increasing number of AT1 receptor antagonists can reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in different groups of hypertensive patients. Meanwhile, current evidence suggests that AT1 receptor antagonists represent an important new approach to cardiovascular therapy and deserve more comprehensive evaluation in hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.",0,0

In the present study, however, we investigated different antioxidant defense mechanisms in patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD) who were either treated with enalapril (10 mg/d) for at least 6 months (+ACEi; n = 11) or untreated (-ACEi; n = 11). The relationship between antioxidant status and HD was examined by determining markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant defense in a group of chronic HD patients (n=33) and a group of age-matched controls (n=29). became. The effect of a single HD session on these parameters was also assessed. Before a HD session (pre-HD), HD patients had significantly lower levels of red blood cells (RBC), glutathione (GSH), selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity (RBC-Se-GPx), plasma ubiquinol-10, and alpha-tocopherol as controls. In a randomly selected patient group (n=19), a single HD session caused an additional decrease in RBC-GSH and plasma ubiquinol-10 levels. Plasma levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) were significantly higher in pre-HD patients than controls. Post-HD plasma TBARS levels were similar to control values. The cohort of +ACEi HD patients had higher pre-HD RBC-GSH content, higher RBC-Se-GPx activity, and plasma beta-carotene concentrations than -ACEi patients (RBC-GSH: +ACEi, 3, 1 +/- 0.9 micromol/mL packaged RBCs [PRBCs], -ACEi, 1.2 +/- 0.3 micromol/mL PRBCs [P < 0.05 v +ACEi], RBC-Se-GPx: + ACEi, 5.8 +/- 0.7 U/mL PRBCs, -ACEi, 4.3 +/- 0.2 U/mL PRBCs [P < 0.05 v +ACEi] Plasma beta-carotene: +ACEi , 0.54 +/- 0.16 micromol/L plasma, -ACEi, 0.19 +/- 0.05 micromol/L plasma [P < 0.05 v +ACEi]).

Randomized investigators of the Aldactone evaluation study.,,"Pitt, B; Zannad, F; Remme, W J; Cody, R; Castaigne, A; Perez, A; Palensky, J; Wittes, J","Aldosterone is important in the pathophysiology of heart failure. In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients with severe heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction not greater than 35 percent who were being treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases, digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomized to receive spironolactone 25 mg daily and 841 to placebo. The primary endpoint was death from any cause.; The study was stopped early after a median follow-up of 24 months because an interim analysis showed that spironolactone was effective. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46 percent) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35 percent; relative risk of death 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval 0.60 to 0.82; p<0.001). This 30 percent reduction in risk of death in patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The rate of hospitalizations for worsening heart failure was 35 percent lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization 0.65; 95 percent confidence interval 0.54 to 0.77; p<0.001) . In addition, patients receiving spironolactone demonstrated a significant improvement in heart failure symptoms as assessed based on the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10 percent of men treated with spironolactone compared to 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001). The incidence of severe hyperkalemia was minimal in both patient groups.; The blockade of aldosterone receptors by spironolactone, in addition to standard therapy, significantly reduces the risk of morbidity and death in patients with severe heart failure.",0,0

Fixed low-dose combination.,,"McClellan, K J; Markham, A","Low-dose drug combinations have been suggested in international guidelines for use in patients with hypertension. The low-dose fixed-dose combination of perindopril 2 mg with indapamide 0.625 mg combines an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with a non-thiazide diuretic. Concomitant administration of perindopril and indapamide in healthy volunteers had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of either active substance. In experimental models of hypertension, perindopril/indapamide restored endothelial function, improved microvascular density, reduced left ventricular and aortic hypertrophy, and reversed renal end-organ damage. Oral perindopril 2 mg/indapamide 0.625 mg once daily normalized blood pressure (BP) in 83.6% of elderly patients with essential hypertension (diastolic BP decreased to < or = 90 mmHg) and in 81.7% of patients with isolated systolic hypertension (systolic BP decreased to < 160 mm Hg) after approximately 1 year of treatment. Blood pressure normalization was maintained in 79.8% of patients throughout the study.

Therefore, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with aspirin can theoretically reduce the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. This study examined the interaction between aspirin (ASA) and enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, and ASA and losartan, an angiotensin subtype 1 receptor antagonist. Seventeen patients with essential hypertension who were on a stable dose of either enalapril (n=7) or losartan (n=10) monotherapy for > or = 12 weeks prior to and during the study were studied. Each patient received a 2-week treatment of placebo, ASA 81 mg/day and ASA 325 mg/day, with each treatment separated by a 2-week washout period. Blood pressure (BP) and serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) samples were obtained at the end of each treatment period. Placebo was compared to each ASA dose for each group. In both the enalapril and losartan groups, mean, systolic, and diastolic blood pressures remained unchanged with the addition of ASA. Levels of TXB2 were suppressed to <10% in both groups with ASA.

We used an algorithm to validate the diagnosis and assess the causal relationship between acute pancreatitis and use of the suspected drug; A total of 55 cases were available for review. We excluded 11 (20.0%) reports because we could not confirm the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. An additional 10 (18%) cases were excluded because the causal relationship with the suspected drug was unlikely.

However, the role of selected active substances in the development of hypoglycaemia remains controversial. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of antihypertensive drugs on the risk of hypoglycaemia in diabetics receiving insulin or sulfonylurea therapy. A matched case-control study was conducted using data from Pennsylvania Medicaid. For each case patient admitted for hypoglycemia in 1993, five sex- and age-matched controls with no reported medical condition of hypoglycemia were randomly selected, resulting in a total of 404 cases and 1375 controls. With these sample sizes, we were able to detect a 10% difference (P<0.05) for our primary endpoint, hospitalization for hypoglycemia. The relative risk of hypoglycaemia was estimated using an unconditional logistic regression. The risk of hypoglycaemia was 5.5 times greater (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0 to 7.6) in insulin than in sulfonylurea users and was reduced by the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) Overall unaffected by inhibitors. However, use of the ACE inhibitor enalapril was associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.3) in sulfonylurea users, suggesting that the analysis of unintended side effects of a drug class is complex these can sometimes mask side effects of individual medications. Beta-blocker use was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia, providing further empirical evidence that beta-blockers are an appropriate treatment for people with concomitant diabetes and hypertension. Per capita health care costs were about three times higher in patients hospitalized for hypoglycemia than in controls (P<0.05).

In diseases such as hypertension, blacks show pathophysiological differences and respond differently to some therapies than whites. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical characteristics and response to therapy of black versus white patients with heart failure.; In the first vasodilator heart failure study (V-HeFT I), 180 black male patients were compared to 450 white male patients with respect to baseline characteristics, prognosis and response to therapy. In V-HeFT II, the same comparisons were performed for 215 black and 574 white male patients, including an analysis stratified by the presence or absence of a history of hypertension.

Charm program investigator.,,"Swedberg, K; Pfeffer, M; Granger, C; Held, P; McMurray, J; Ohlin, G; Olofsson, B; Ostergren, J; Yusuf, S","Chronic heart failure (CHF) is an increasing public health burden. Pharmacologic treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers improves survival and reduces hospitalizations in patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Despite these therapies, morbidity and mortality remain problematic. In addition, 30% to 50% of patients with CHF have preserved LVEF. It is not known if treatments in this group are of benefit. Candesartan in Heart Failure-Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM) is a program to evaluate the clinical utility of the long-acting angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker candesartan cilexetil in a broad spectrum of patients with symptomatic heart failure. Patients with systolic dysfunction, tolerating or intolerant of an ACE inhibitor, and patients with preserved systolic function are included. Specifically, the CHARM program consists of 3 independent, parallel, placebo-controlled studies in patients with (1) LVEF less than or equal to 40%, treatment with ACE inhibitors (n=2,300); (2) LVEF less than or equal to 40%, ACE inhibitor intolerance (n=1,700); (3) LVEF greater than 40%, not treated with ACE inhibitors (n=2,500). The 3 studies will be combined to assess the effect of candesartan cilexetil on all-cause mortality in the broad spectrum of symptomatic heart failure. The primary objective of each study is to assess the impact on the composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality or CHF hospitalization. Other endpoints include impact on myocardial infarction, hospitalization for all causes, and resource utilization. CHARM is designed to randomize 6,500 patients with symptomatic heart failure from 26 countries in Europe, the United States, Canada, South Africa and Australia. The CHARM program began enrolling patients in March 1999. The follow-up period is at least 2 years. The study is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2002.",0,0

Patients with seated diastolic blood pressure (BP) > or = 110 mmHg during the placebo run-in period received HCTZ 12.5 mg once daily for 1 week. Those with seated diastolic blood pressure > 95 mm Hg after the HCTZ run-in were randomized (2:1) to receive candesartan cilexetil 8 mg once daily (n=141) or placebo (n=76) plus HCTZ 12.5 mg . After 1 week of double-blind treatment, patients with seated diastolic blood pressure > or = 90 mm Hg were up-titrated to candesartan cilexetil 16 mg once daily or matched placebo plus HCTZ 12.5 mg; 84% required uptitration. The primary measure of efficacy was a change in trough (24 +/- 3 hours post-treatment) seated diastolic blood pressure from the end of the HCTZ run-in period to double-blind week 4. Mean changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly greater for candesartan cilexetil than on placebo, -11.3/-9.1 mmHg versus -4.1/-3.1 mmHg, p<0.001/p<0.001. Patients with higher seated diastolic blood pressure at the end of the HCTZ enema tended to have a greater decrease in blood pressure (p<0.05). Most patients (53%) who received candesartan cilexetil were responders (diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg or > or = 10 mm Hg decrease) and 32% were controlled (diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg). Tolerability and safety profiles were similar in the candesartan and placebo groups.

Severe exfoliative rash has also been associated with captopril, but a combined occurrence of toxic epidermal necrolysis and agranulocytosis has not been previously reported. We report an unusual case of captopril-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis with agranulocytosis in a patient with no known risk factors. Bone marrow suppression was successfully treated with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and white blood cell (WBC) counts recovered within 3 days of starting therapy. This case underscores the early experience with captopril, which showed a strong correlation between high doses used to treat hypertension and bone marrow suppression.",0,0
192,10501269,Lowering blood pressure for primary and secondary prevention of stroke: Treating high blood pressure reduces the risk of stroke.,,"O'Brien, A A; Rajkumar, C; Bulpitt, C J","High blood pressure is the most important risk factor for developing a stroke. It is also the risk factor most amenable to treatment. Results from 18 controlled studies show a 25-47% reduction in the relative risk of stroke in treated hypertensive patients. This reduction applies to both older and younger patients, but absolute reductions are greater in older people and the number of patients with hypertension requiring treatment to prevent stroke is lower in older people because they are at higher risk of stroke . Reductions in relative but not absolute risk appear to be similar in both isolated systolic hypertension and combined systolic and diastolic hypertension in the elderly. The case for antihypertensive treatment in secondary stroke prevention is less clear, but the results of four clinical trials of antihypertensive treatment in patients with and without hypertension and a history of cerebrovascular disease suggest a likely benefit. The results of the PROGRESS study will further illustrate this.",0,0

However, there are conflicting results regarding the dose-response relationship of ACE inhibitors.; We studied 45 patients (age 55 +/- 10 years) with stable CHF receiving enalapril maintenance doses of either 5 mg twice daily (E10; n=16), 10 mg twice daily (E20; n=18), or 20 mg twice daily (E40; n=11). This dosage was changed three times to treat all patients at lower, higher and initial dosages for 4 weeks each. Neurohormones (atrial natriuretic peptide [ANP], brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] and norepinephrine) and trough levels of enalaprilat were measured and ergospirometry was performed; Changes in enalapril dose and enalaprilat levels were consistent in 82% of patients, indicating good compliance. After increasing enalapril to 40 mg daily, patients in the E10 group showed an increase in maximal oxygen consumption and a decrease in neurohormonal stimulation, while the opposite changes were observed in patients in the E20 and E40 groups after reducing enalapril to 10 mg daily (maximum oxygen consumption: delta 1.1 +/- 2.0 vs. -1.0 +/- 1.9 ml. kg(-1). min(-1), P < 0.01; ANP: delta -63 +/- 106 vs 19 +/- 54 pg/mL, P<0.01 BNP: Delta-62 +/- 104 vs 18 +/- 89 pg/mL, P<0.05 Norepinephrine: Delta -1.3 +/- 2.9 vs 0.6 +/- 1.8, P<0.05). Within-patient comparison showed that neurohormone levels were higher and exercise tolerance lower when patients received enalapril 10 mg per day than when they received 40 mg per day (ANP: 172 +/- 148 vs. 139 +/- 122 pg/mL , P<0.01 BNP: 193 +/- 244 versus 152 +/- 225 pg/mL, P<0.005 Norepinephrine: 4.2 +/- 2.2 versus 3.5 +/- 1, 6 nmol/L, P<.05, peak oxygen consumption 22.0 +/- 4.4 vs 21.3 +/- 4.3 mL.kg(-1), min(-1) P<.05) . Similar differences were observed when these variables were compared, and patients had the lowest and highest enalaprilat trough levels. High doses of enalapril led to an improvement in exercise capacity and a reduction in neurohumoral stimulation, while these parameters worsened after a reduction in the enalapril dose. Therefore, patients with congestive heart failure may benefit from increasing the dosage of ACE inhibitors.",0,0

195,10503655,Etiology and mechanisms of drug-induced lupus.,,"Rubin, R L","Systemic rheumatic complaints occur with very different frequencies as a side effect of long-term therapy with around 39 drugs currently in use. Because symptoms are nonspecific, subjective, and multifaceted, diagnosis of drug-induced lupus (DIL) requires awareness of this chronic medication risk. However, laboratory characteristics and the characteristic of full recovery after treatment discontinuation are useful in distinguishing between drug-induced and spontaneous lupus or other syndromes. Drug-induced lupus is likely mediated by reactive drug metabolites, not the drugs ingested, and susceptibility to neutrophil-mediated oxidative transformation is a property of ten lupus-inducing drugs reported to date. Mechanisms for DIL that mimic drug hypersensitivity reactions are experimentally unsupported and inconsistent with the characteristics of DIL. However, several new lines of inquiry using mouse models have opened up promising clues as to the origin of autoreactive T cells and disease development in DIL.",0,0

Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), a balanced iv vasodilator, has been shown to produce beneficial hemodynamic and clinical effects in this cohort. A prospective, randomized, parallel-group study was conducted to assess acute, intermediate, and chronic changes in hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and renal variables in response to PGE1, dobutamine, and placebo. Thirty patients with class III and IV heart failure and a low cardiac index (mean 1.9 L/min/m2) two hours after oral ingestion of medications, including high-dose enalapril, were enrolled. A 7-day infusion of PGE1 (16.5 +/- 5 ng/kg/min, range 10 to 20 ng/kg/min, Group A n=10), dobutamine (4.5 +/- 1 microgram/kg /min, range 2.5 to 5 micrograms/kg/min, Group B n=10) or placebo (saline, Group C n=10) was administered via a central venous line after stepwise titration until PGE1 or an increase of 20% developed intolerable side effects in the cardiac index occurred with dobutamine continued at this dose while PGE1 was maintained at 50% of the peak dose. Hemodynamic data were collected at baseline, peak doses, 12 hours and 7 days. Of the neurohumoral variables, plasma norepinephrine, large endothelin (Big ET), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were assessed simultaneously using RIA methods. Renal plasma flow (by paraaminohippurate clearance) and glomerular filtration rate (by iothalamate clearance) were measured before and during the infusions (after 12 hours and after 7 days). At the peak dose and after 12 hours, a significant decrease from baseline in mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance was observed, which was accompanied by an increase in cardiac output with both PGE1 and dobutamine. These changes were maintained through 7 days, as pulmonary vascular resistance levels also fell with both drugs. Blood pressure did not change at all times, but PGE1 increased heart rate slightly at 12 p.m. Both PGE1 and dobutamine increased renal plasma flow after 7 days, but only PGE1 significantly decreased glomerular filtration fraction. The glomerular filtration rate did not change with any drug. PGE1 decreased ANP levels by 12 hours and dobutamine increased big ET levels at the peak but decreased big ET levels at 7 days. Norepinephrine levels were unaffected throughout. Except for a slight decrease in right atrial pressure at 7 days, placebo did not significantly change any measured variable. Taken together, these data suggest that treatment with PGE1 is as effective as low-dose dobutamine in improving cardiac output and renal blood flow in advanced heart failure. Importantly, no deleterious neurohumoral counter-regulation was observed in PGE1.",0,0

At present, routine dipstick screening of all adults for microscopic hematuria is not recommended because this finding is sporadic and the incidence of significant associated urinary disorders is low. However, once asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is discovered, its cause should be investigated with a thorough history (including a review of current medications) and a focused physical examination. Laboratory and imaging tests, such as intravenous pyelography, renal ultrasound, or retrograde pyelography, may be needed to determine the extent and location of the associated disease process. Cystourethroscopy is performed to complete the assessment of the lower urinary tract.

Once the decision to initiate antihypertensive drug therapy has been made, JNC-VI recommends one of three pathways for the choice of initial therapy: one pathway for patients with uncomplicated hypertension, another for patients with well-defined indications for specific drugs, and a third pathway for Patients with various concomitant diseases, in which one or another drug has a beneficial effect. At this point, the place for the newest class of antihypertensive drugs, the angiotensin II receptor antagonists, remains uncertain. Currently, they are considered reasonable alternatives for patients who have a compelling need for an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor but develop a cough while taking this drug. As data from ongoing trials become available, angiotensin II receptor antagonists could prove to be a good choice for first-line therapy in many patients because of the favorable side-effect profile of this class of drugs.",0,0

Patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 110 mm Hg at the end of a 4-week run-in period) were randomized to double-blind, 12-week treatment with either a combination tablet of felodipine and metoprolol (Logimax), 5/50 mg daily ( n=321), enalapril 10 mg daily (n=321), or placebo (n=304), with the option to double the dose after 4 or 8 weeks of treatment if needed (diastolic blood pressure remains >90 mm Hg). Combined treatment with felodipine and metoprolol controlled blood pressure (diastolic < or = 90 mm Hg 24 h after dosing) in 72% of patients at 12 weeks compared to 49% on enalapril and 30% on placebo. A dose adjustment was required in 38% of patients receiving the combination, 63% of patients treated with placebo and 61% of patients treated with enalapril. The overall incidence of adverse events during treatment with felodipine metoprolol was 54.5%; the corresponding values for enalapril and placebo were 51.7% and 47.4%, respectively. Treatment discontinuation due to side effects occurred in 18 patients treated with the combination, 10 patients treated with enalapril and 12 patients treated with placebo. No significant change in patient well-being was observed in any of the three study groups. These results show that a fixed combination tablet of felodipine and metoprolol enables normalization of blood pressure in a significantly larger proportion of patients than enalapril alone. This improved effectiveness is achieved without compromising tolerability. The fixed-dose combination of felodipine and metoprolol can therefore become a valuable option for initiating antihypertensive treatment.",0,0

The aim of this study was to determine whether renal impairment affects the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a combination of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The study had a parallel-group design that compared patients with impaired kidney function and body-mass-index-matched controls. The study was carried out in a university hospital on 13 patients with impaired renal function (mean creatinine clearance 55.7 +/- 15.6 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 ) and 13 age, sex and body mass index -matched normal controls (mean creatinine clearance 102.4 +/- 8.9 mL min-1 1.73 m-2). All patients and normal controls received fosinopril sodium 20 mg and HCTZ 12.5 mg as daily oral administration on days 1-5. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters of fosinoprilat and HCTZ were determined from blood and urine samples collected over a 48-hour period from Day 1 (single dose) and Day 5 (steady state): maximum serum concentration (Cmax), time to peak serum concentration (tmax), area under the serum concentration-time curve during the dosing interval (AUC), cumulative urinary output (CUE), and accumulation index (AI; ratio of AUC-day 5/AUC-day 1). Pharmacodynamic parameters were also measured over 24 h on day 1 and over 48 h on day 5: serum ACE activity and arterial blood pressure.; Pharmacokinetic parameters of fosinoprilat on day 1 in patients with renal impairment compared to healthy patients: Cmax = 387 +/- 0.19 vs. 324 +/- 0.25 ng ml-1 (p = 0.07); tmax = 3.5 vs 3.0 h (P = 0.58); AUC = 3510 +/- 0.29 vs. 2701 +/- 0.35 ng ml-1 h (P=0.072); CUE = 5.08 +/- 2.70 versus 7.40 +/- 2.56% (p=0.009).

As part of the study, data on the use of resources in healthcare was collected. We performed a cost-benefit analysis to estimate the lifetime benefit of the treatment and the associated costs. We observed no differences between treatments in terms of number of hospital admissions, hospital days, and emergency room visits per patient during the trial period. We estimated the total cost of losartan to be $54 (95% CI: -$1717, $1755) per patient less than captopril over this period. We also estimated that losartan would increase survival by 0.20 years (undiscounted) at an average cost of $769 (discounted) more per patient over the projected remaining lifetime of the study population compared to captopril. This cost increase resulted in a cost-benefit ratio of $4,047 per life year gained for losartan compared to captopril.

However, a retrospective analysis suggests that iv verapamil combined with thrombolysis may improve prognosis, and an ongoing study (VAMI study) is testing this hypothesis. When given to patients without heart failure in the late hospital phase of AMI, verapamil significantly reduces mortality and morbidity.

A single oral dose of enalapril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, carvedilol 25 mg, and celiprolol 200 mg resulted in mean 24-hour reductions in blood pressure over placebo of 24/11, 11/5, 13/6, and 12/5 mmHg, respectively (p-values between <0.02 and <0.001). For enalapril, amlodipine and carvedilol, inter-subject variability contributed significantly to the overall variability of measurements (p-values between 0.05 and 0.01 versus zero), while this was not the case for celiprolol. Although the beta-blockers lowered daytime blood pressure similar to ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers, they did not lower nighttime blood pressure. These results were confirmed by an 8-week crossover study comparing enalapril 10 mg daily with celiprolol 200 mg daily in the same patient group. The authors conclude (1) that beta-blockers produce a more stable reduction in blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension who are less affected by sympathetic nervous system pressor effects; (2) that beta-blockers, unlike ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, do not induce nocturnal hypotension in this patient category; and (3) that the selective beta-blocker celiprolol may even outperform the non-selective beta-blocker carvedilol in this regard.",0,0

The ACE genotype, which is assigned by an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism, is known to affect the potency of ACE inhibitors in several renal diseases. The authors sought to clarify whether the effect of ACE inhibitors on restenosis might be modified by ACE genotype. A total of 126 patients were randomized and prospectively assigned to the control group and the imidapril group. In the imidapril group, patients received imidapril 5 mg daily starting 1 day before PTCA and continuing for 3 to 6 months. Forty-six control patients (65 vessels) and 32 imidapril patients (43 vessels) completed the study. The minimum lumen diameter before and after the intervention did not differ significantly between the groups with the three genotypes (II, ID and DD) in both the control and the imidapril group. Late luminal loss during the follow-up period was not associated with ACE genotype in the control group but was significantly associated in the imidapril group (II, 0.63 +/- 0.19 mm; ID + DD, 1.12 +/- 0.14 mm, p<0.05). In addition, in genotype II, imidapril significantly reduced late loss and restenosis rates as defined by most commonly used definitions. In conclusion, the ACE I/D polymorphism may influence the effect of ACE inhibitors in preventing restenosis after PTCA.",0,0

Little information is available to predict which patients are at highest risk for this complication.; To quantify specific clinical predictors of decreased renal function in patients with CHF prescribed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy.; We analyzed data from the Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) studies, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of enalapril for the treatment of CHF. 3379 patients were randomized to enalapril with a median follow-up of 974 days and 3379 patients were randomized to placebo with a mean follow-up of 967 days. Decreased renal function was defined as an increase in serum creatinine >/= 0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) from baseline. We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decline in renal function, including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline creatinine, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of hypertension, diabetes, and antiplatelet use. diuretics, and beta-blocker therapy.; Patients randomly assigned to enalapril had a 33% greater likelihood of decreased kidney function than controls (p=0.003). A multivariate analysis revealed that in both the placebo and enalapril groups, older age, diuretic therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function, while beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective. Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing decreased renal function in both groups, but significantly greater in the enalapril group (enalapril: risk ratio [RR] 1.42 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32- 1.52 with enalapril placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25). Diuretic therapy was also associated with a greater risk of decreased renal function in the enalapril group (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.70-2.08) than in the placebo group (RR 1.35, 95% -CI 1.09-1.66). Conversely, enalapril had a relative renoprotective effect (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13-1.53) compared to placebo (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.57-2.44) in patients with diabetes.

Joint National Committee for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.",,"Singh, V; Christiana, J; Frishman, W H","The prevention and treatment of hypertension remains a major challenge for clinicians around the world. The recently published Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI) uses evidence-based medicine to provide guidelines that support physicians in the prevention, detection and treatment of high blood pressure, including pharmacological ones Approaches. Calcium channel blockers are widely used to treat hypertension and JNC-VI focuses on specific situations where calcium channel blockers could be considered as preferred treatments. A large number of calcium antagonists are available with a variety of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects. Several prolonged-release formulations of these drugs are also available. In terms of blood pressure control, calcium channel blockers are more effective than beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers as antihypertensive treatments in black patients. The dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. The rate-lowering calcium antagonists can be used as an alternative to beta-blockers in patients with coronary artery disease and high blood pressure. Calcium antagonists can be used as an alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients with hypertension and concomitant diabetes mellitus and/or renal disease. Some dihydropyridine calcium antagonists may be useful as an alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients with hypertension and systolic heart failure. Calcium antagonists appear to be extremely useful in patients with cyclosporine-induced hypertension and in patients with hypertension and concomitant Raynaud's phenomenon and/or migraine. The rate-lowering agents can be used in patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias and hypertension. Clinicians should be aware of calcium channel blocker drug interactions, especially after recent problems with mibefradil. Although retrospective studies have raised controversy regarding the safety of calcium channel blockers in patients with hypertension, more recent prospective studies have not revealed any major safety concerns regarding these drugs.",0,0

In one study, captopril had a comparable effect to diuretics or beta-blockers in terms of overall cardiovascular prevention, but was slightly less effective in preventing stroke. (2) In studies of hypertensive people over the age of 65, some diuretics and beta-blockers reduced the risk of stroke, coronary events, heart failure, and death. In one study, a diuretic was superior to a beta-blocker in terms of preventive efficacy and side effects. In one study, nitrendipine in combination with other antihypertensive drugs prevented strokes. (3) In a study of hypertensive diabetics, captopril and atenolol reduced the risk of stroke, heart failure, and worsening retinal disease without preventing coronary events or death.

Cooperative Study Group.,,"Lewis, J B; Berl, T; Bain, R P; Rohde, R D; Lewis, E J","Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease in the United States. We conducted a study to examine the effects of assignment to different levels of blood pressure control on the course of diabetic nephropathy type 1 in patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. We also examined the long-term course of this well-characterized cohort of patients receiving ACE inhibitor therapy. One hundred twenty-nine patients with type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy who had previously participated in the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition in Diabetic Nephropathy study and whose serum creatinine level was less than 4.0 mg/dl were randomly assigned to a mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) target of 92 mm Hg or less (Group I) or 100 to 107 mm Hg (Group II). Patients received varying doses of ramipril as the primary therapeutic antihypertensive drug. All patients were followed up for at least 2 years. Outcome measures included iothalamate clearance, 24-hour creatinine clearance, creatinine clearance estimated by the Cockcroft and Gault formula, and urinary protein excretion. The mean difference in MAP between the groups was 6 mmHg over the 24-month follow-up. The median iothalamate clearance in Group I was 62 mL/min/1.73m(2) at baseline and 54 mL/min/1.73m(2) at the end of the study, compared to a baseline of 64 mL/min /1.73m(2). 2) and finally 58 ml/min/1.73 m2 in group II. There were no statistically significant differences in the rate of renal function decline between groups. There was a significant difference in total urinary protein excretion between group I (535 mg/24 h) and group II (1,723 mg/24 h; p=0.02). 32% of the 126 patients achieved a final total protein excretion less than 500 mg/24 h. Groups I and II patients had equivalent rates of side effects. In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy, the MAP target for optimal renoprotection should be 92 mmHg or less when defined as including decreased proteinuria.

Since angiotensin II is known to stimulate the prosclerotic cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), we postulated that the renoprotective effect might be due to inhibition of TGF-beta1 production. Serum TGF-beta1 levels were measured in patients in the captopril study at baseline and at 6 months. TGF-beta1 analyzes were performed on all available patient sera. Analysis was performed between percent change in TGF-beta1 levels during the first 6 months and percent change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over the following 2 years. TGF-beta1 levels increased by 11% (P=0.003) in the placebo group (n=24) while they decreased by 14% (P=0.01) in the captopril group (n=34). There was an inverse correlation between percent change in TGF-beta1 levels during the first 6 months and percent change in GFR over the subsequent 2-year period in patients on both placebo (r = -0.55, P = 0.005 ) and captopril groups (r = -0.45, P = 0.008). In patients with a baseline GFR below 75 mL/min, there was an even stronger correlation between percent change in TGF-beta1 levels and percent change in GFR in both placebo and placebo (n=9, r=-0.69, p=0.03) as well as in the captopril group (n=21, r=-0.73, P=0.0001).

Although there are many such remedies, there may be some important differences between them. This placebo, run-in, double-blind, crossover study with 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring compares the efficacy of perindopril 4-8 mg and enalapril 10-20 mg once-daily antihypertensive drugs in 32 patients. For diastolic blood pressure (DBP), perindopril demonstrated a placebo-corrected peak (P) reduction in blood pressure (BP) of -6.4 +/- 1.3 mmHg versus its placebo-corrected trough (T) of -5.2+ /- 1.7mmHg . Enalapril had a DBP reduction of -8.5 +/- 1.3 mmHg (P) and -5.7 +/- 1.7 mmHg (T). In systolic blood pressure (SBP), perindopril had a reduction of -7.5 +/- 1.6 mmHg (P) versus -7.3 +/- 2.2 mmHg (T) compared to enalapril at -10.8+ /- 1.6 mmHg (P) versus - 8.3 +/- 2.3 mmHg (T). The placebo-corrected trough-to-peak ratio (SBP/DBP) for perindopril was 0.97/0.81 versus 0.77/0.67 for enalapril. There was no difference in 24-hour mean blood pressure, area under the curve, or casual blood pressure measurements after dosing. Both perindopril and enalapril were well tolerated and the two treatment groups had similar safety profiles. Perindopril thus had a predictable and sustained blood pressure effect, allowing 24-hour care for the patient without excessive peak effects or weak trough effects.",0,0
225,10569324,Effect of quinapril or metoprolol on circadian sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation after acute myocardial infarction.,,"Kontopoulos, A G; Athyros, V G; Papageorgiou, A A; Boudoulas, H","Abnormal impairment of the autonomic nervous system in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has a circadian pattern with greatest manifestation in the morning hours; it probably plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias and acute ischemic syndromes. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors improve autonomic function in patients with AMI, but the circadian pattern of this effect has not been studied. Heart rate variability-normalized rate domain indices were measured 5 days (baseline) after the start of uncomplicated AMI and 30 days after therapy with quinapril (n=30), metoprolol (n=30), or placebo (n=30) with a solid-state digital holter Monitor. Normal subjects (n=30) were used as controls. Quinapril increased parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic modulation and improved sympathovagal interactions, manifested by an increase in normalized high-frequency power (HFP) and a decrease in normalized low-frequency power (LFP) and its ratio (LFP/HFP) throughout the treatment 24-hour Time period (p<0.001) with maximum effect on the ratio (p<0.0001) between 02:00 - 04:00, 08:00 - 11:00 and 19:00 - 22:00 (delta % ratio -30%, -32% and -26%). Metoprolol increased HFP and decreased LFP and the LFP/HFP ratio mainly between 08:00 and 12:00 and 19:00 and 22:00 (delta % ratio -21% and -12%, respectively, p< 0.001). Heart rate variability indices in the placebo group and controls remained unchanged 30 days after the baseline study. In summary, quinapril increased parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic and partially restored sympathovagal interaction in patients with uncomplicated AMI throughout the 24-hour period, with peak effects in the early and late morning and evening hours. Metoprolol had a similar effect, but at a lower level, in the late morning and evening hours.

226,10569660,Synergistic efficacy of enalapril and losartan on exercise performance and oxygen consumption at maximal exercise in congestive heart failure.,,"Guazzi, M; Palermo, P; Pontone, G; Susini, F; Agostoni, P","Oxygen consumption at maximal exercise (peak VO2) is a strong independent predictor of congestive heart failure (CHF) outcome. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE or AT1 receptor blockers is effective at peak VO2. We investigated whether the mechanisms for the two categories of drugs are similar and whether their combination is able to produce a synergistic effect. Twenty CHF patients were randomized to receive double-blind placebo + placebo (P+P), enalapril (20 mg/day) + placebo (E+P), losartan (50 mg/day) + placebo (L +P), and enalapril + Losartan (E+L) or the same preparations in reverse order for 8 weeks each. Two patients did not complete the study. Lung function, cardiopulmonary stress test, plasma neurohormones, and quality of life were assessed at the end of each treatment. Maximum VO2 increased similarly (16% and 15%, respectively) and significantly (p<0.01) compared to P+P, E+P, and L+P. Enalapril improved lung function (reduced slope of ventilation versus carbon dioxide production and dead space to tidal volume ratio and increased alveolar membrane conductivity and increased tidal volume). Losartan likely activated blood flow to exercising muscles (increased delta VO2/delta work rate, which is a measure of aerobic work efficiency). Combined, they further increased peak VO2, 10% from E+P (p<0.05) and 11% from L+P (p<0.05). Compared to run-in, E+P and L+P significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine by 70 +/- 14 pg/ml and 100 +/- 16 pg/ml and aldosterone by 1.6 +/- 0.7 ng/dl and 1.6 +/- - 0.8ng/dl. These changes were significantly greater when the drugs were combined (140 +/- 20 pg/mL for norepinephrine and 5.6 +/- 0.9 ng/dL for aldosterone). The quality of life score did not improve significantly at each treatment step. Thus, lorsartan and enalapril similarly increased maximal VO2 in CHF patients, but the mediators of this effect were, at least in part, different therapeutic targets that may be synergistic when the two drugs are combined.",0,0

After a 4-week washout period and 4-week P monotherapy (4 mg/day), IND (2.5 mg/day) or HCT (25 mg/day) was added for 4 weeks. The choice of diuretic was random. After a 4-week washout period from the diuretic in which only P was administered, the alternative diuretic was administered for an additional 4 weeks. P significantly lowered blood pressure. However, the drug was more effective in patients with higher plasma renin activity (PRA). The combination treatment induced an additional reduction in blood pressure values, mainly in patients with low PRA. The combination of P+HCT was more effective than the combination P+IND. The addition of either HCT or IND elicited a small but statistically significant increase in serum glucose levels during both the fasting and the 75 g oral glucose load. However, insulin levels did not change significantly during the study. Small but not statistically significant changes in serum electrolytes and lipid parameters were observed during the different phases of the study, while a statistically significant increase in serum uric acid was noted when the P + HCT combination was administered. We conclude: (1) P in small doses is an effective and safe antihypertensive agent, (2) PRA has predictive value in determining the efficacy of P treatment, (3) the combination of P with small doses of HCT or IND is more effective than P alone, (4) the combination treatment has adverse effects on carbohydrate tolerance while there are no significant changes in serum electrolyte and lipid parameters.",0,0

All measurements were performed at a blood glucose level of 5 mmol L-1; Transcapillary NaF leakage was greatly increased in normal albuminuric type 1 diabetics compared to healthy subjects (p<0.001) and was even more increased in microalbuminuric type 1 diabetics (p<0.01 compared to normoalbuminuric patients). Enalapril reduced NaF leakage (P<0.05), mean arterial blood pressure (P<0.05) and microalbuminuria (P<0.05). After treatment, NaF leakage did not differ from that in normoalbuminuric patients.; Capillary permeability, determined by NaF leakage, is increased in normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetics with long-standing disease, and the excessive increase in microalbuminuric type 1 diabetics is ameliorated by ACE inhibition. Skin NaF video densitometry appears to be a useful tool for documenting capillary permeability in intervention studies.",0,0

ATLAS study group.,,"Packer, M; Poole-Wilson, P A; Armstrong, P W; Cleland, J G; Horowitz, J D; Massie, B M; RydÃ©n, L; Thygesen, K; Uretsky, B F","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are generally prescribed by physicians at doses lower than the high doses shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. However, it is unclear whether low doses and high doses of ACE inhibitors have similar benefits.; We randomized 3164 patients with New York Heart Association class II-IV heart failure and an ejection fraction < or = 30% to double-blind treatment with either low dose (2.5 to 5.0 mg daily, n = 1596) or high dose ( 32.5 to 35 mg daily, n = 1568) of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril for 39 to 58 months while continuing background therapy for heart failure. Compared to the low dose group, patients in the high dose group had an 8% non-significantly reduced risk of death (p=0.128) but a 12% significantly reduced risk of death or hospitalization from any cause (p=0.002). 24% fewer heart failure hospitalizations (P=0.002). Dizziness and renal insufficiency were observed more frequently in the high-dose group, but the two groups were similar in the number of patients requiring study drug discontinuation. Conclusions - These results indicate that heart failure patients should generally not be treated with very low doses of an ACE inhibitor (unless these are the only doses that can be tolerated) and indicate the difference in efficacy between medium and high doses of an ACE inhibitor (if present) is probably very small.",0,0

It is increasingly recognized that immunological mediators play a pathogenic role in the pathophysiology of CHF. Whether ACE inhibitor therapy modifies immunological variables has not yet been investigated.; Seventy-five patients (mean age 52 +/- 11 years) with CHF were randomized in a double-blind study between low- (5 mg daily) and high-dose (40 mg daily) enalapril. Circulating levels of immunological parameters (ie pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules) were measured at baseline, after 10 weeks and at the end of the study (34 weeks); All immunological parameters, with the exception of the soluble interleukin (IL)-6 receptor, were increased in CHF compared to 21 healthy controls. During the study, immunoreactive IL-6 levels decreased (p<0.05) and soluble IL-6 receptors increased (p<0.05) during high-dose but not during low-dose enalapril therapy. Furthermore, IL-6 bioactivity decreased only during the high dose (p<0.001), resulting in a significant difference in change during treatment between the two dose groups (p<0.001). This reduction in IL-6 bioactivity was significantly associated with decreased interventricular septal thickness as assessed by echocardiography (r=0.56, p=0.013). No other variables changed during treatment.; In patients with severe CHF, high-dose therapy with enalapril is associated with a significant decrease in IL-6 activity. However, despite treatment with a high-dose ACE inhibitor, these patients have persistent immune activation that may be important for CHF progression.",0,0

In fact, there are several ways to assess ACE in vivo: these are serum ACE activity itself, plasma N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP), urinary AcSDKP, plasma angiotensin I (AI) , plasma angiotensin II (AII) or the AII/AI ratio.; Patients with chronic heart failure (n=39) were randomized to 1-week ACEI non-compliance, 1-week ACEI compliance, or two versions of 1-week partial compliance, after which the above six tests were performed; All six tests significantly differentiated between complete nonadherence for one week and complete or partial adherence. Only plasma AcSDKP resulted in a significantly different result between partial adherence and either complete adherence or complete non-adherence for one week. In terms of its ability to distinguish complete nonadherence from complete adherence, plasma AcSDKP was 89% sensitive and 100% specific with an area under its ROC of 0.95. The corresponding figures for urinary AcSDKP were 92%, 97% and 0.95 and for serum ACE they were 86%, 95% and 0.90; All six tests distinguished complete nonadherence from all other forms of adherence.

The aim of this study was to analyze the skin reactions reported to the spontaneous surveillance systems of four Italian regions (Friuli Venezia Giulia, Lombardy, Sicily and Veneto) and to correlate the reports with the estimated drug use during the same period with particular reference to reactions to antimicrobials and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); All adverse drug reactions (ADRs) spontaneously reported to the surveillance systems of four Italian regions (with a total population of approximately 20 million people) between January 1996 and December 1997 were analyzed by an expert panel including dermatologists. Reactions were classified as either serious or non-serious events based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Critical Term List. Drug use was expressed as Daily Defined Dose (DDD)/1000 population/day.; A total of 2224 reports of adverse skin reactions (44.7% of all reported ADRs) were identified, which corresponds to a reporting rate of about 5.5 per 100,000 inhabitants/year. The female/male ratio was 1.58 and the reporting rate steadily increased with age. The drug categories with the highest number of skin reactions were antimicrobials, followed by NSAIDs, analgesics and radiological contrast agents. There were a total of 372 (16.9%) reports of serious reactions, the most common being angioedema (171 cases), erythema multiforme (68 cases) and photosensitivity (37 cases). Co-trimoxazole, followed by the cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, has been associated with the highest consumption-related reporting rate among antimicrobials, and aspirin and dipyrone among NSAIDs and analgesics.; Spontaneous reports from four Italian regions revealed that the skin is the organ most frequently affected by ADRs.

Several studies suggest that bradykinin (BK) is responsible for ACEi-induced AE, but the mechanism remains unclear. We examined the metabolism of BK and des-Arg9-BK in the serum of 20 patients with a history of ACEi-associated AE and 21 controls (C). Synthetic BK was incubated with the sera for various periods of time, and residual BK and generated des-Arg9 BK were quantified by specific and sensitive enzyme immunoassays. No significant difference in half-life (t1/2) of both BK and des-Arg9-BK could be measured between C patients and patients with AE (AE) without ACEi. However, analysis for prolonged (+) or no (-) t1/2 of des-Arg9-BK allowed C subjects and AE patients to be re-stratified into four subgroups. Preincubation of sera with enalaprilat at a concentration that inhibits ACE significantly prevented the rapid degradation of BK and des-Arg9-BK in these four subgroups. In the presence of ACEi, a subgroup (50%) of AE patients (AE + ) had a particularly significant increase in t1/2 of des-Arg9-BK. Once ACE was inhibited, the concentration or type of ACEi had no significant effect on the t1/2 of des-Arg9-BK. However, test dilution of AE + serum with a control serum (C) showed that an enzyme defect, rather than a circulating inhibitor, could be responsible for the abnormal metabolism of des-Arg9-BK when ACE is inhibited. In summary, half of the patients with ACEi-associated serum AEs had an enzyme defect involved in Des-Arg9-BK metabolism leading to its accumulation. The B1 agonist may be at least partially responsible for the local inflammatory response associated with AE.",0,0

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to improve altered fibrinolytic balance in hypertensive patients. However, it has not been documented whether this is due to a decrease in the formation of angiotensin II (Ang-II) or is a consequence of increased local bradykinin levels. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of an ACE inhibitor (perindopril) and an Ang II receptor antagonist (losartan) on fibrinolytic kinetics. We have previously measured serum levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) antigen and activity, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen and activity, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) and of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and after achievement of blood pressure goal (< 140/90 mm Hg) in 13 hypertensive patients receiving perindopril (mean age 40 +/- 11 years, 6 females, 7 males) and in 12 patients who received losartan (mean age 38 +/- 9 years, 6 females, 6 males). We also compared the baseline fibrinolytic activity of hypertensive patients with that of 12 normotensive controls (mean age 40 +/- 9 years, 6 females, 6 males). The mean basal plasma levels of PAI-1 antigen, PAI-1 activity and sTM were significantly higher in the hypertensive patients than in the normal controls (P<0.005). Values of other analytes were similar in both groups. Elevated plasma levels of PAI-1 antigen, PAI-1 activity and sTM were reduced in patients after receiving perindopril and losartan (P<0.005); the reductions in the losartan-receiving group were more pronounced (P<0.05). There were no significant effects on plasma levels of t-PA antigen, t-PA activity and TFPI in patients receiving the two therapeutic regimens (P > 0.05). In summary, chronic hypertension is associated with hypofibrinolysis. The beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on fibrinolysis appears to be related to Ang-II blockade, and increased kinin activity does not appear to play a major role.",0,0

We examined the influence of ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and the effect of hypertension therapy on renal function in 116 patients with chronic glomerulonephritis. The patients were divided into hypertensive, normotensive and hypotensive according to the level of arterial blood pressure and age. Hypotensive patients showed improvement in renal function and normotensive patients showed a slower rate of progression of renal function loss than hypertensive subjects, suggesting that the appropriate ABP value in patients under 40 years of age was 100-125/55-75 mmHg, 100-135/60- 80 mmHg in patients 40-60 years of age or 105-140/60-85 mmHg in patients over 60 years of age. The renal protection of calcium antagonists was associated with the achievement of lower blood pressure levels, while blood pressure levels did not affect the progression of renal function in patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.

This study examined whether gender or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism affected disease progression and treatment response in these patients. DeltaGFR (0.43 +/- 0.05 versus 0.48 +/- 0.08 mL/min per 1.73 m2) and ESRD incidence (23 and 22%, respectively) were comparable in male and female patients. However, compared to conventional treatment, ramipril was more effective in reducing deltaGFR (-52% vs. -19%) and progression of ESRD (-74% vs. -40%) in women than in men. Thus, the relative risk (95% confidence interval [CI]) of events (ESRD) between conventional and ramipril treatment was 5.52 (1.59 to 19.17, p=0.003) in women but only 1.80 (1 .08 to 2.97, p=0.02). in men. This gender effect of ramipril was associated with a greater reduction in proteinuria (-7.8 +/- 4.2% vs. -21.9 +/- 5.7%, P=0.05) and was more potential even after correction Confounding factors such as GFR still evident at baseline, daily sodium intake, ramipril dose, blood pressure control, and concomitant treatment with diuretics or dihydropyridinic calcium channel blockers (adjusted RR [95% CI]: women 5.07 [1.26 to 20.38], P=0.02; males 1.44 [0.85 to 2.44], P=0.17). Ramipril consistently reduced deltaGFR and the incidence of ESRD in women with either DD (-39% and -100%) or II + ID (-71% and -82%) genotype and in men (-25% and -50%) . of the DD genotype, but had no beneficial effect in men with the II + ID genotype (+18% and +34%). Thus, the relative risk of events (ESRD) between conventionally and ramipril-treated men was higher in patients with the DD genotype (1.85; 0.69 to 4.94) and lower in patients with II +/- ID genotype (0.71; 0.28 to 1.80). ). Again, proteinuria increased in parallel with deltaGFR and events in women with DD (-23.3 +/-8.0%) or II + ID (-16.0 +/-9.5%) genotype and in men with DD genotype (-14.8 +/- 7.0%) but did not change in males with II + ID genotype (+1.0 +/- 7.8%). Notably, the ACE genotype-related effect of ramipril was still evident even after correcting for the above potential confounders (adjusted RR [95% CI]: DD, 2.52 [0.83 to 7.63], P= 0.10, II + ID, 0.35 [0.12 to 1.01], P=0.05). Therefore, among patients with chronic proteinuric nephropathy, men have an increased risk of progression due to their lower response to treatment with ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibition is uniformly renoprotective in females regardless of ACE polymorphism and in males with the DD genotype, but is virtually without beneficial effects in males with the II or ID genotype. This information can help guide therapeutic interventions in clinical practice and interpret the results of prospective studies in chronic kidney disease.",0,0

Patients (n=28) received ramipril 5 mg daily or placebo in a double-blind crossover design for 6 weeks, followed by 6 months of open-label ramipril treatment. Mental stress (a 20-minute Stroop color word conflict test) and a cold pressure test were administered at the end of each of the three study periods. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded non-invasively. Ramipril reduced resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure (from 146+/-3/99+/-3 with placebo to 135+/-4/94+/-3 at 6 weeks and 136+/-4/91+/- 3 mm Hg at 6 months, in the laboratory) and in the case of psychological stress. Resting heart rates remained unchanged with ramipril. Ramipril decreased systolic blood pressure and heart rate responses during psychological stress; diastolic blood pressure responses were unchanged. Ramipril reduced cardiac workload (systolic blood pressure x heart rate) and responses. Treatment effects were generally greater at 6 months than at 6 weeks. During the cold pressure test, systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were reduced by ramipril, but the responses were unchanged. However, heart rate responses were reduced. Thus, ramipril also reduced cardiac workload and responses during the cold pressor test. These results indicate that ACE inhibitors can reduce cardiac workload in stressful situations. If confirmed, it appears to offer an advantage in treating high blood pressure.",0,0

Notable are DeltaGFR (-0.28 +/- 0.07 vs. -0.43 +/- 0.09 ml/min/1.73 m2 per month) and incidence of ESRD [14% vs. 36%, P = 0.04, RR (95% CI), 2.62 (1.02 to 6.71)] were lower for ramipril than conventionally treated patients in the DD genotype but not in the II and ID genotypes. In either univariate (P=0.04) or multivariate (P=0.01) analysis, ramipril significantly predicted a lower incidence of events in DD patients but not in II and ID patients. At three months, ramipril was more effective in reducing proteinuria in DD (-38.2%) than in the II (-26.7%) or ID (-19.2%) genotypes. In patients with DD (but not II or ID) treated with ramipril, a short-term reduction in proteinuria correlated with DeltaGFR over the entire follow-up period (P=0.02, r=-0.41). In nondiabetic proteinuric nephropathies, the ACE I/D polymorphism does not predict disease progression but is a strong predictor of ACE inhibition-associated renoprotection, since proteinuria, DeltaGFR, and progression to ESRD are effectively reduced in patients with, but not into, DD with the II or ID genotype.",0,0

259,10620545,ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists in renal transplantation: a safety and efficacy analysis.,,"Stigant, C E; Cohen, J; Vivera, M; Zaltzman, J S","Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are a class of antihypertensive drugs that reduce mortality in congestive heart failure and have demonstrated efficacy in treating hypertension and slowing established diabetic nephropathy and other proteinuria-associated glomerulonephritis. These drugs have not gained widespread acceptance in the treatment of hypertension in kidney transplant recipients (RTRs) due to the potential for decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate associated with a single kidney and concomitant use of cyclosporine. Experimental animal models suggest that ACEi may be beneficial in slowing the progression of chronic renal transplant rejection. We performed a retrospective chart analysis of all RTRs at our facility that had been treated with an ACEi or an angiotensin II (AT-II) antagonist with the aim of determining the safety, efficacy, and side-effect profile of these drugs. The minimum follow-up time was 6 months. One hundred seventy-seven of 642 RTRs were prescribed an ACEi or AT-II antagonist. 47 patients discontinued therapy, with the most common reasons for discontinuation being cough (8 patients) and hyperkalemia (6 patients). Mean arterial blood pressure was lower at each follow-up period than at the start of ACEi or AT-II antagonist therapy, with a decrease from 92 +/- 12 mm Hg to 86 +/- 9 mm Hg (P < 0.05) after 3 years of treatment. The serum creatinine concentrations did not change during the follow-up period. There was a non-sustained rise in serum from 4.4 +/- 0.5 to 4.6 +/- 0.6 mEq/L at 3 months (P < 0.05), but no further increases in potassium beyond this period beyond. The mean hemoglobin concentration for the cohort did not change, but 13 RTRs administered an ACEi for post-transplant erythrocytosis (PTE) had a decrease in hemoglobin of 17.1 +/- 1.0 g/dL at the start of the ACEi Therapy to 14.8 +/- 2.2 g to /dL at 3 years (P < 0.05). ACEi and AT-II antagonists were generally effective antihypertensives and were safe and well-tolerated agents in this RTR cohort. ACEi were also effective in treating PTE.",0,0

In 12 patients with stable CAD, we measured coronary sinus blood flow and myocardial oxygen supply and consumption (MVO2) in sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing (30 beats/min above sinus rate), both at control and during infusion of NTG, 1 micrograms/kg/min and NTG, 2 micrograms/kg/min. To examine metabolic coronary vasodilation, changes in myocardial oxygenation were related to stimulation-induced changes in MVO2 using standard regression analysis. The myocardial oxygen supply/consumption ratio (ie, the slope of the regression line in the control that characterizes physiologic metabolic coronary flow regulation) was compared to the ratios obtained during the infusion of NTG. Compared to control measurements, NTG 1 microgram/kg/min and NTG 2 microgram/kg/min attenuated the stimulation-induced increase in MVO2 by 29 and 60%, respectively, while coronary blood flow was unchanged during stimulation. In the control, normal metabolic regulation of coronary flow resulted in a myocardial oxygen supply/demand ratio of 1.39 (95% CI, 1.29-1.49). This ratio did not change during NTG, 1 microgram/kg/min: 1.44 (95% CI, 1.33-1.56). However, with NTG, 2 micrograms/kg/min, this ratio increased significantly to 1.84 (95% CI, 1.63-2.05; p<0.01). Intravenous administration of high-dose NTG, a donor of exogenous NO, attenuates the stimulation-induced increase in MVO2 and may increase metabolic coronary vasodilation in patients with CAD.",0,0

This open-label, single-use study was conducted in 18 healthy volunteers at a single center. The volunteers received a single oral dose of 60 mg zofenopril calcium after an overnight fast. The tablet was swallowed with 250 ml of water. Fasting was continued for an additional 4 h after dosing, and no other fluid intake was allowed from 1 h before to 2 h after dosing. Plasma concentrations of zofenopril and its active metabolite zofenoprilat, and serum ACE activity were measured before drug intake (baseline) and on timed samples over a 36-hour period after dosing using LC-MS-MS, a highly sensitive validated method for active parts, measured concentrations. Peak plasma concentration was reached after an average of 1.19 h for zofenopril and after 1.36 h for zofenoprilat. Concentrations then decreased and reached values below or near the limit of quantification (1 ng.ml-1 for zofenopril, 2 ng.ml-1 for zofenoprilat) from 8 to 16 h after dosing. Complete inhibition of ACE was observed at the time of the first blood draw (1 h) and lasted up to 9.44 h on average. ACE activity was then slowly reactivated, but enzyme inhibition persisted and was estimated to be 74% and 56% at 24 and 36 hours after drug administration, respectively. Based on these data, complete or almost complete enzyme inhibition is to be expected with repeated administration of zofenopril.",0,0

In 1989 we began a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to evaluate the anti-albuminuric effect of enalapril compared to nifedipine (slow-release) in 102 patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. These patients were followed up for a mean study duration of 5.5 +/- 2.2 years. We examined the determinants, including the effect of ACE inhibition on clinical outcomes in these patients.; After a 6-week placebo-controlled run-in period, 52 patients were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive nifedipine (slow-release) and 50 patients to enalapril. After the one-year analysis, which confirmed the superior anti-albuminuric effect of enalapril (-54%) versus nifedipine (+11%), all patients continued their previously assigned treatment with informed consent. They were divided into normoalbuminuric (N=43), microalbuminuric (N=34), and macroalbuminuric (N=25) groups based on two of three 24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UAE) measurements during the run-in period. Renal function was demonstrated by 24-hour UAE, creatinine clearance (CCr) and regression coefficient of annual plasma creatinine reciprocal (beta-1/Cr). Clinical endpoints were defined as death, cardiovascular events, and/or renal events (requirement for renal replacement therapy or doubling of baseline plasma creatinine). Across the group, enalapril-treated patients were more likely to revert to normal albuminuria (23.8 vs. 15.4%) and fewer of them developed macroalbuminuria (19.1 vs. 30.8%) compared to the patients treated with nifedipine (p<0.05). .

273,10652967,Progression from hypertension to heart failure. mechanisms and management.,,"Cleland, J G","Patients with hypertension are at increased risk of developing heart failure (HF), but the mechanisms by which hypertension leads to HF are unclear [although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a clear predictor of increased risk of HF] . Although antihypertensive therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of heart failure in hypertensive patients, it is not known how this benefit comes about and at present there is no clear evidence that any class of antihypertensive drugs is more effective than any other in this respect . Theoretically, one might expect that beta-blockers would be ideal for preventing heart failure in hypertensive patients. In addition to controlling blood pressure and regression of LVH, they have clear advantages for morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction (MI), which probably plays an important role in the development of HF in hypertensive patients, and for the prognosis of HF itself. A reduction of long-term mortality after MI has only been demonstrated for non-selective beta-blockers. Carvedilol, a non-selective beta-blocker that also has other complementary properties, including alpha-1 receptor blockade and antioxidant effects and a favorable metabolic profile, may be an appropriate choice for the prevention of heart failure in hypertensive patients. This is compounded by the beneficial benefits of carvedilol in reducing morbidity and mortality from heart failure itself.",0,0

In a subgroup analysis, baseline PFR was found to be normal (=2.5 EDV/s) in 12 patients (subgroup A) and impaired (<2.5 EDV/s) in the remaining 12 (subgroup B). In both subgroups, valsartan and enalapril induced a significant and comparable reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In subgroup A, valsartan and enalapril did not induce significant changes in PFR. In subgroup B, valsartan increased PFR at both rest (from 2.0 +/- 0.3 to 2.4 +/- 0.3 EDV/s, P<0.01) and at maximal exercise (from 4, 1 +/- 1.1 to 4.4 +/- 1.0 EDV/s, P < 0.05), while enalapril reduced the PFR neither at rest (2.0 +/- 0.4 EDV/s, P < 0.01 versus valsartan) nor at maximal exercise (3.7 +/- 1.1 EDV/s, P < 0.05 versus) modified valsartan); Valsartan-induced blockade of the renin-angiotensin system may improve LV filling in patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension and impaired diastolic function.

In both psychiatry and cardiology, there has been an explosion in the use of new drugs without widespread knowledge of their potential interactions. The increasing trend towards polypharmacy, the use of psychotropic drugs by cardiologists and general practitioners caring for cardiac patients, and the increasing aging of the population pose major challenges for practitioners. Finally, there is a need for models/paradigms to predict possible drug interactions - e.g. B. the cytochrome p450 scheme. This paper describes a method for identifying, understanding, and codifying the interactions between psychotropic drugs and cardiac drugs, a systematic approach to updating this key database, and specific interactions between cardiac psychotropic drugs. In particular, this document 1) describes the interactions, 2) addresses the level of their clinical significance, 3) describes the potential mechanisms of the interactions, and 4) provides recommendations for the clinician. Because the majority of original clinical trials, whether for cardiac drugs or psychotropic drugs, do not include studies comparing these two drug domains simultaneously, their interactions are often not known until their combined use in the clinical setting, using the patient as a ""guinea pig"" , "" and through subsequent reporting.",0,0

Although these disorders have a significant impact on quality of life and can represent a significant underlying condition, they are often overlooked by the medical community. Patients may have difficulty recognizing smell and taste disorders and often confuse the concepts of taste and taste. While the most common causes of odor disorders are nasal and sinus disorders, upper respiratory tract infections, and head injuries, common causes of odor disorders include oral infections, oral devices (eg, dentures), dental procedures, and Bell's palsy. Medications can affect the sense of smell and taste and should be reviewed in all patients with reported dysfunction. In addition, advancing age has been linked to a natural impairment in the ability to smell and taste. A focused medical history and physical examination of the nose and mouth are usually sufficient to look for underlying pathologies. Computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging of affected areas and commercially available standardized tests may be useful in selected patients. The most treatable causes of olfactory dysfunction are obstructive polyps or other masses (treated by excision) and inflammation (treated with steroids). Improving the taste and appearance of food can improve the quality of life for patients with irreversible dysfunction.",0,0

Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcome Trial.,,"Lim, P O; Donnan, P T; MacDonald, T M","Treated patients with hypertension may be five times more likely to die from cardiac and cerebrovascular disease than patients with normal blood pressure with equivalent resting blood pressure (BP). Research suggests that exercise blood pressure is a better predictor of end-organ damage and mortality than resting blood pressure, and data from our center show that a significant proportion of treated hypertensive patients have uncontrolled blood pressure during a 5-minute Dundee step test . The prognostic utility of exercise blood pressure has yet to be translated into clinical practice due to the lack of a suitable technique. The Dundee Step Test is being evaluated in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcome Trial (ASCOT), a multicentre, multinational, 5-year follow-up study evaluating the effects of newer (amlodipine and perindopril) and older (bendroflumethiazide and atenolol) antihypertensive drugs is stratified according to cholesterol levels and cardiac outcome.

Forty-seven people with normal blood pressure were similarly evaluated as controls.; FBF during reactive hyperemia was significantly lower in the 296 hypertensive patients than in age-matched normotensive subjects. The increase in FBF after administration of sublingual NTG was similar in both groups. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and vascular resistance of the forearm were higher in the untreated group than in the four treated groups and did not differ with regard to the antihypertensive drug used.

Her serum sodium was 109 mEq/l, with a serum osmolality of 225 mOsm/kg, a urine osmolality of 414 mOsm/kg and a puncturine sodium of 122 mEq/l. Diclofenac 75 mg qd for osteoarthritic pain and lisinopril 10 mg qd for hypertension was started in 1990. Lisinopril was increased to 20 mg qd in August 1994 and to 20 mg bid pm in August 1996 to increase blood pressure; Metoprolol 50 mg qd was added in July 1996.

To determine whether the response to an ACE inhibitor, as measured by urinary sodium excretion, was different in renin-low patients compared to renin-high patients.; Plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured in 38 patients with stable chronic heart failure (21 males, 17 females; mean (SD) age 71 (6) years, range 59-82 years) treated with chronic diuretics alone. They were divided into three groups: low (PRA </= 1.5 ng/ml/h, n = 11); normal (1.5<PRA<5, n=14); and high (PRA > 5, n = 13). The effect of ACE inhibition was then evaluated on diuretic-induced natriuresis in relation to renin status.; There were no significant differences in age and gender distribution between the groups. Plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone increased serially from low to high renin groups, while 24-hour urinary sodium concentrations decreased from low to high renin groups (low PRA, 96.7 (39.5); normal PRA, 90.4 ( 26.7); high PRA, 66.3 (18.9) mmol/L; p=0.033), despite a higher dose of diuretics in the high-renin group. This attenuated natriuretic effect of loop diuretics was caused by RAAS activation, which was partially reversed by ACE inhibition. ACE inhibitors increased natriuresis by 22% in the high-renin group (p=0.029) but had no effect in the normal and low-renin groups. Within the low-renin group, five of the 11 patients had persistently low renin levels despite ACE inhibition. There was a non-significant reduction in natriuresis (-9.6%, p=0.335) after ACE inhibition in this subgroup of patients.; About a third of the heart failure patients in our study had low renin status and non-activated RAAS despite diuretic treatment. ACE inhibitors did not significantly alter natriuresis in this subset of patients and only increased natriuresis in high-renin patients. There is therefore preliminary support for renin profiling in targeting ACE inhibitors for merit testing by showing that short-term sodium retention does not occur in patients with low renin when ACE inhibitors are discontinued.",0,0

Using immunoblot and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques, we show that both human aortic and coronary artery VSM cell lines express PPARgamma protein and mRNA for both PPARgamma isoforms, PPARgamma1 and PPARgamma2. Immunocytochemical staining localized the PPARgamma protein mainly within the cell nucleus. Troglitazone dose-dependently inhibited basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet growth factor-BB-induced DNA synthesis and downregulated growth factor-induced expression of c-fos. Troglitazone also inhibited the migration of coronary artery VSM cells down a concentration gradient of platelet growth factor-BB. These results demonstrate for the first time the expression and nuclear localization of PPARgamma in human coronary artery and aortic VSM cells.

The combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker may induce a greater degree of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system than either agent alone. Such increased suppression could be beneficial for patients who have progressive decline in renal function due to chronic kidney disease.; A multinational, multicentre, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, parallel group study was conducted in a cohort of patients with progressive chronic renal failure (creatinine clearance 20-45 mL/min) either with or without proteinuria and hypertension. The primary aim of the study was to investigate the safety and tolerability of the combination of valsartan and benazepril. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 received valsartan 160 mg once daily (n=22); Group 2 received valsartan 80 mg once daily plus benazepril 5 or 10 mg once daily (n=42); Group 3 received valsartan 160 mg once daily plus benazepril 5 or 10 mg once daily (n=44).

Since angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can attenuate ankle swelling by CCB, these parameters were assessed using a similar design during the combination of amlodipine (10 mg UID) and enalapril (20 mg UID) (n=10). As a control, the effect of enalapril monotherapy (10 and 20 mg UID for 2 weeks each) was examined in a third series of patients (n = 8). Amlodipine (5 mg UID) increased leg weight without changing postural vasoconstriction (the percentage decrease in cutaneous blood flow from the horizontal to dependent position), indicating that extravascular fluid shift was independent of postural cutaneous vasoconstriction. However, at 10 mg UID, amlodipine reduced postural vasoconstriction and further increased leg weight, suggesting that cutaneous blood flow autoregulation limited additional fluid transfer. Both parameters normalized after drug withdrawal. Enalapril per se did not affect cutaneous vasomotion or leg weight but reduced the amount of dependent fluid extravasation through the CCB despite sustained antagonism for postural vasoconstrictor responses.",0,0

No change in urinary albumin to creatinine ratio was observed in the amlodipine group (baseline 68 +/- 21 mg/g; year 1 52 +/- 21 mg/g; year 5 148 +/- 74 mg/g) , while in the enalapril group it decreased significantly at year 1 (baseline 23 +/- 4 mg/g; year 1, 13 +/- 3 mg/g; P < 0.05) and remained stable at the end of the study remained year 5 (14 +/- 6 mg/g). The researchers concluded that blood pressure was similar in both groups, but only enalapril had a significant effect in maintaining reduced urinary albumin excretion for a 5-year follow-up. Although proteinuria has been considered a surrogate for renal disease progression, further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis in ADPKD as no differences in renal function were observed between the enalapril and amlodipine groups at 5 years.

All treatment groups showed minor changes in lipid parameters. Triglyceride increased by 2.7% (valsartan 160 mg) to 9.1% (placebo). Total cholesterol decreased with valsartan 80 mg, while other groups showed increases of up to 0.031 mmol/L. Decreases in total cholesterol (p=0.018), apolipoprotein B (p=0.042), and apolipoprotein A1 (p=0.025) were significant for the comparison of valsartan 80 mg and captopril. Valsartan 80 mg or 160 mg od does not cause harmful changes in the diabetic lipid profile and, unlike captopril, is not associated with dry cough.",0,0
294,10694829,Does Chinese ethnicity affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors?,,"Ding, P Y; Hu, O Y; Pool, P E; Liao, W","Information from clinical and pharmacokinetic studies of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) has been obtained from predominantly male and Caucasian subjects, but the use of ACEIs extends to populations worldwide. Significant differences between Chinese in general and Caucasian males have been demonstrated in the pharmacokinetics/dynamics of other drug classes that may impact the use of ACEIs in the Chinese population. These include: significant Chinese/Caucasian genetic variation in the renin-angiotensin system based on an insertion/deletion (O/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene; the genetic determination of plasma ACE activity in the Chinese population; and genetic factors affecting disease substrate, which may also affect response to treatment. Oral and intravenous pharmacokinetic data are available for cilazapril, fosinopril and perindopril from different studies in Chinese and Caucasian subjects, and pharmacodynamic data are available for eight different ACEIs. Based on these data, there are few differences in the pharmacokinetics of ACEIs between Chinese and Caucasians. Most ACE inhibitors had good antihypertensive effects in Chinese (benazapril, enalapril, fosinopril and spirapril), although cilazapril may have less antihypertensive effects or cilazapril or perindopril had relatively shorter effects compared to Caucasians. Chinese suffer from coughs caused by ACEIs (captopril and enalapril) more often than Caucasians. Data suggests that fosinopril may not induce a cough in as many subjects as other ACEIs, and this appears to be true in Chinese as well. The currently unknown mechanism could involve the dual elimination pathway of fosinopril (hepatic and renal). Pharmacokinetic data also support the use of fosinopril in congestive heart failure where elimination pathways may be impaired. In summary, ethnic differences between Chinese and Caucasians in terms of ACE and AGT gene polymorphisms, which might be expected to differentially affect the effect of ACEIs in these two ethnic groups, actually have no such effect. Rather, the differences between the ACEI seem to be more important. Journal of Human Hypertension (2000) 14, 163-170.",0,0

After 8 and 48 weeks of active treatment, intravenous glucose tolerance tests, euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps, and serum lipid measurements were performed. At 48 weeks, insulin sensitivity was reduced by 23% with atenolol while being unchanged during treatment with trandolapril (+0.5%, p=0.0010 for difference between treatments, ANCOVA). The effect on triglycerides (+22% versus -8.5%) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-13% versus +0.7%) also differed significantly between atenolol and trandolapril. The results after 8 weeks were similar. Glucose tolerance was not affected by any of the drugs. Atenolol reduced diastolic blood pressure (DBP) better than trandolapril (-15.3 mmHg versus -6.6 mmHg for DBP in the supine position at 48 weeks, P=0.012). The difference in effect on insulin sensitivity between drugs was 25% of baseline insulin sensitivity and persisted through 48 weeks of treatment.

296,10696996,Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists.,,"Burnier, M; Brunner, H R","The blockade of the renin-angiotensin system began with the study of the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases using specific pharmacological probes. Oral activity, achieved by shortening the original peptide structures, transformed the probes into therapeutics, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, ACE is a non-specific target for blocking the renin-angiotensin enzymatic cascade. The availability of orally active drugs made ACE inhibition a therapeutic breakthrough, but more specific blockade always seemed desirable. This goal has now been achieved with the orally active angiotensin II receptor antagonists; Six are on the market and more are in development. This new class of drugs is on a par with ACE inhibitors in terms of its effectiveness, at least in the case of hypertensive patients. Ongoing studies will show whether angiotensin II receptor antagonists can prevent target organ damage and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. If so, these compounds could one day replace ACE inhibitors.",0,0

However, the effects of ACE inhibition on myocardial fatty acid metabolism in this patient population have not been studied. We tested the hypothesis that ACE inhibitor therapy improves myocardial fatty acid metabolism and reduces mortality in patients after AMI.; Forty-two patients after the first anterior AMI and primary angioplasty were randomized to receive titrated oral enalapril (n=24) or placebo (n=18) therapy. Iodine-123-labeled 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) single-photon emission computed tomography imaging was performed a mean of 4.8 days after AMI and 1 month after AMI. BMIPP anomalies were quantified by a polar map as a severity index.; There were no significant changes in baseline, cardiac function, or angiographic findings between patients in the enalapril group and patients in the placebo group. However, the BMIPP severity index from acute phase to chronic phase was significantly reduced in the enalapril-treated group (118 +/- 48 to 82 +/- 36, P < 0.05) but not in the placebo group (123 +/- - 65 to 115+/-58, P not significant).; ACE inhibitor therapy improved myocardial fatty acid metabolism and regional left ventricular function in patients with anterior AMI. BMIPP single photon emission computed tomography results suggest that this better result may be due to an improvement in cell function with ACE inhibitors.",0,0

After a 2-week placebo period, hypertensive patients (diastolic BP 95-115 mmHg) were randomized to either trandolapril 2 mg once daily or captopril 25 mg twice daily for 6 months. Trandolapril and captopril were packaged in electronic pill boxes equipped with a microprocessor that recorded the date and time of each opening (MEMS). Patient compliance was assessed by both standard pill counting and electronic monitoring. Blood pressure was measured using a validated semi-automated device at the end of the placebo period and the treatment period. 162 patients participated in the study. Compliance data were evaluable in 133 patients (62 in the captopril group and 71 in the trandolapril group). Treatment groups were comparable at baseline, with the exception of age (p=0.046). Using the electronic pill box, overall compliance was 98.9% in the trandolapril group and 97.5% in the captopril group (p=0.002). The percentage of missed doses was 2.6% in the trandolapril group and 3.3% in the captopril group (p=0.06). The percentage of delayed doses was 1.8% in the trandolapril group and 11.7% in the captopril group (p=0.0001). The percentage of correct dosing periods, ie a period with only one correctly recorded opening, was 94.0% in the trandolapril group and 78.1% in the captopril group (p=0.0001). Adjusted for age, the results remained unchanged. At the end of the study, blood pressure was normalized (systolic blood pressure < 140 and diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg) in 41% of patients in the trandolapril group and 27% in the captopril (NS) group. In this 6-month study, the electronic pill box enabled a refined analysis of hypertensive patient compliance. Patient compliance with trandolapril once daily was higher than with captopril twice daily. The difference between the groups is mainly explained by an increase in delayed doses in the twice-daily dosing group.",0,0

Cognitive effects were assessed through tests of attention, visuo-spatial and verbal memory, learning, reasoning, planning, problem solving, speed and coordination. Affect was assessed using two different depression rating scales.; Perindopril and the diuretic had no adverse effects on various aspects of cognitive function. Mood, assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory, improved with perindopril and the error rate on the motor screening test was lower. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed that both drugs achieved effective 24-hour control.; The ease of use and the ability to adjust the test level to the needs of the individual patient, together with the reliability of the longitudinal test/retest results, show that CANTAB is an important addition to the available methods for quantifying central nervous system disorders and drug effects. The other purpose of the study was to assess any adverse cognitive effects of perindopril compared to a drug HT, which is believed to have no adverse central nervous system effects. Perindopril was free of side effects in all objective tests used. In addition, benefit was found in two independent assessments of depression (the Hamilton and Beck rating scales).",0,0

After a titration period of at least 10 days, patients tolerating 50 mg twice daily were randomly assigned to either the low or high dose of captopril and followed up to 2 years; 298 patients were included and followed up for an average of 12 months. The progression of heart failure appears to be favorably influenced by high-dose therapy compared to low-dose therapy; a 29% relative difference in the rates of heart failure worsening was observed between the two doses, 31.5% and 22.4% for the low and high dose, respectively (p=0.088). High dose treatment also showed a trend towards benefit compared to low dose, with the number of hospitalizations for all causes from 22.4 to 14.5% (p=0.1) and for congestive heart failure from 14.7 7.2% (p=0.06) was reduced; also, the incidence of fatal and non-fatal cardiac events showed a trend in favor of the high dose of 22% (p=0.142).

To assess the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure in a teaching hospital and any differences between specialties, we studied all patients in Glasgow's Western Infirmary between 1st and 236th n = 236). We found that most patients received an ACE inhibitor (66%), 12% had tried but found intolerant, 10% had not been tried because of a contraindication, but 12% had not been tried despite no contraindication. 58% of treated patients received a dose used in a large survival study (38% of all patients). Most patients were treated by a cardiologist (64%). Of these, more were on an ACE inhibitor (77% vs 53%, p<0.01), fewer had been tried but found intolerant (11% vs 18%), and fewer had never been tried (11% vs <0.01), regardless of whether there was a contraindication (5% vs 18%, p<0.01) or not (6% vs 12%). More patients received a dose used in a large survival study (48% vs. 31%, p<0.05). We conclude that despite improvements over time, ACE inhibitors are still underused, sometimes without good reason.

The drugs were applied topically to the tongue surface of both young and elderly subjects to mimic the situation where the drug is released into the saliva. Detection thresholds ranged from 0.048 mM (propafenone) to 0.438 mM (procainamide). The detection thresholds of healthy elderly subjects did not differ significantly from young controls. The tested compounds also had a predominantly bitter taste for other qualities. In addition, topical application of the drugs to the tongue affected the taste of one or more taste stimuli, with drugs differing in the pattern of taste effects exhibited. The mechanism of the taste effects is not fully understood, but the results of this study suggest that one pathway could be due to the effects of drugs on peripheral taste receptors.",0,0

Various modalities have been used to prevent contrast agent-induced nephrotoxicity, namely saline infusion, mannitol, furosemide, calcium channel blockers, atrial natriuretic factor and dopamine infusion with varying degrees of success. The possible role of renin-angiotensin system-mediated medullary ischemia in the genesis of contrast-induced nephrotoxicity prompted us to investigate the role of captopril (a sulfhydryl group containing an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) in its prevention. Seventy-one patients with diabetes mellitus undergoing coronary angiography were included in the study. Patients randomized to receive captopril received the drug at a dose of 25 mg three times a day for three days, starting one hour before angiography, while patients in the control group underwent routine angiography without receiving captopril. After angiography, patients in the control group developed significant increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels compared to those receiving captopril. Contrast-induced nephrotoxicity (ie, a 0.5 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine) developed in 29 percent of the control group. The administration of captopril reduced the risk of developing contrast medium-induced nephrotoxicity by 79 percent. Glomerular filtration rate, measured by Tc-DTPA kidney scanning before and 24-72 hours after angiography, showed a mean decrease in glomerular filtration of 9.6 mL/min in the control group, while the captopril group showed a mean increase of 13 ml/min had rating.

Post hoc analyzes of many ACEI-based clinical trials show the greatest slowing of kidney disease progression in patients with the greatest degree of renal impairment at baseline. However, many physicians refrain from using ACEIs or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with renal failure because of concerns that either serum creatinine or potassium levels will rise.; To determine whether a limited initial reduction in either glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or an increase in serum creatinine levels associated with the use of ACEI or angiotensin receptor blockers results in long-term protection against worsening renal function in patients with renal impairment.; We reviewed 12 randomized clinical trials examining kidney disease progression in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Six of these studies were multicentre, double-blind, and placebo-controlled; the remainder were smaller randomized studies with at least 2 years of follow-up of renal function. These studies evaluated patients with and without diabetes or systolic heart failure. The mean follow-up time for all studies was 3 years. Studies were evaluated in relation to changes in either serum creatinine or GFR in the group allocated to an ACEI (N=1102). For 64% of these subjects (705/1102), renal function data were available both at less than 6 months and at the end of the study.; Most studies have shown that patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency have an acute fall in GFR, a rise in serum creatinine, or both. Those randomized to an ACEI with a serum creatinine level of 124 pmol/L or greater (> or = 1.4 mg/dL) demonstrated a 55% to 75% reduction in the risk of kidney disease progression compared to those with normal renal function who were randomized to an ACEI. An inverse correlation was observed between the extent of renal impairment at baseline and the subsequent rate of annual decline in renal function after randomization to an antihypertensive regimen containing an ACEI.; There is a strong association between an acute increase in serum creatinine of up to 30%, which stabilizes within the first 2 months of ACEI therapy, and long-term preservation of renal function.

""Pill-induced"" esophagitis is associated with the use of certain medications and is responsible for many cases of erosive esophagitis. To date, more than 70 drugs have been reported to cause esophageal disease. Antibiotics such as doxycycline, tetracycline and clindamycin are the culprits in more than 50% of cases. Other commonly prescribed drugs that cause esophageal injury include aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), potassium chloride, ferrous sulfate, quinidine, alprenolol, and various steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, many doctors and even more patients are not aware of this problem. Capsules or tablets are often delayed in their passage through the esophagus. Highly caustic coatings, direct drug injury, and poor esophageal clearance of pills can lead to acute inflammation. Esophageal damage occurs when the corrosive contents of a drug remain in the esophagus long enough to produce mucosal lesions. Taking medications before bed or not drinking is a common cause of esophagitis. The possibility of drug-related harm should be considered in all cases of oesophagitis, chest pain and dysphagia. History and gastrointestinal endoscopy confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is supportive, although acid reduction is often used as an adjunct.

It is still unclear whether these effects could also be achieved by blocking the angiotensin II (ATII) type 1 receptor.; We randomized 201 patients with acute myocardial infarction to be treated with either direct angioplasty, thrombolysis, or heparin alone with the ACE inhibitor captopril or the ATII antagonist losartan. The primary endpoints were safety, tolerability, and left ventricular parameters. Patients were followed for at least 15 days. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar in both groups, although cough was less frequent in the losartan group. Captopril failed to prevent an increase in end-diastolic volume and did not affect left ventricular end-systolic volume. This effect resulted in an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.001) with no change in wall motion index. Losartan had no effect on end-diastolic volume but decreased end-systolic volume (p<0.001), resulting in a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (p<0.001) and a decrease in wall motion index (p<0.001).; This study suggests that losartan is safe and well-tolerated in post-myocardial infarction patients.

Subjects were given quinapril 10 mg or placebo daily for 7 days prior to the study. On the day of the study, the subjects were euglycemic clamped and then loaded with liquid (20 ml/kg tap water orally plus urine loss). A 1 hour intravenous infusion of ANP 0.05 mg.kg(-1) x min(-1) was administered during steady-state diuresis. Urine was collected at 15 minute intervals to determine the albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR). The results were analyzed by ANOVA; Mean baseline arterial pressure was similar after pretreatment with quinapril and placebo (98.7 +/- 3.8 vs. 100 +/- 4.5 mmHg, mean +/- SD, P > 0.5) and was estimated by ANP -Infusion not changed on both study days. Baseline ACR was similar between quinapril and placebo (P=0.13). ANP infusion induced an increase in urinary ACR with placebo (58.4 +/- 40.2 to 393.6 +/- 262.9 mg/mmol, P = 0.006) but not with quinapril (29.3 +/- 10.7 to 81.5 +/- 43 mg/mmol , P=0.15). The urinary ACR response to ANP infusion was higher with placebo than with quinapril (p=0.02); Quinapril blocks the albuminuric effect of intravenous ANP infusion in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and established microalbuminuria.

The antihypertensive efficacy of rilmenidine in the treatment of type 2 diabetics has been demonstrated and is associated with very good clinical and laboratory tolerability.; This was a 6-month, double-blind, randomized, controlled study comparing the effects of rilmenidine and captopril on the progression of microalbuminuria in a population of patients with mild to moderate hypertension [90 mmHg < diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 110 mmHg], type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria (30 mg/24 h < urinary albumin excretion < or = 300 mg/24 h); Between Month 0 and Month 6, mean supine blood pressure was similarly reduced by rilmenidine (systolic blood pressure from 159 to 141 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure from 98 to 84 mmHg) and captopril (systolic blood pressure from 157 to 144 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure from 101 to 82 mmHg). The median microalbuminuria was reduced from 160 (90-260) to 56 (27-87) mg per 24 h with rilmenidine and from 144 (51-200) to 54 (41-123) mg per 24 h with captopril. The creatinine clearance rate was not significantly altered by either treatment during the study (with rilmenidine it varied from 95.2 to 95.6 mL/min; with captopril it varied from 86.2 to 90.4 mL/min) . There was no statistical difference between the changes in glycated hemoglobin levels for the rilmenidine and captopril treated groups. Clinical and laboratory acceptability was good and that of the two groups was comparable.; Rilmenidine exerts antihypertensive effects similar to those of captopril in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. The decreases in microalbuminuria produced by the two treatments are not different. That administration of rilmenidine reduces microalbuminuria suggests that it may exert nephroprotective effects.",0,0

All physicians and community pharmacy owners and managers in the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland were asked to participate in the study. Pharmacists who agreed to participate were asked to list patients from participating physicians with prescriptions for (1) furosemide and digoxin with and without an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor inhibitor and (2) an ACE inhibitor. Physicians were visited by a pharmacist and asked if any of their patients receiving digoxin and furosemide were being treated for CHF and to identify further cases of CHF among their patients receiving an ACE inhibitor. The doctors in the intervention group received scientific information on the use and dosing of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor inhibitors in CHF. Both groups were re-interviewed after three months to determine if any changes in therapy had occurred in each patient discussed at the first visit. The positive predictive value of treatment with digoxin and furosemide to identify patients treated for CHF was 94%. Seventy-six percent of patients taking digoxin and furosemide identified by physicians as having CHF patients were being treated with an ACE inhibitor. 36% of patients treated with an ACE inhibitor for CHF received the target dose. Four physicians reported that the outreach visit influenced their prescribing, but there was no significant difference in ACE inhibitor prescribing between the intervention and control groups. A pharmacist education program involving the use of prescribing information and academic detail did not impact ACE inhibitor prescribing or dosing, but proved valuable as a quality assurance tool.",0,0

In long-term clinical studies, only diuretics and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce this risk. Whether newer antihypertensive drugs reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unknown.; To compare the effect of doxazosin, an alpha-blocker, with chlorthalidone, a diuretic, on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension in a study of 4 types of antihypertensive drugs: chlorthalidone, doxazosin, amlodipine and lisinopril.; Randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial, the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, initiated February 1994. In January 2000, after an interim analysis, an independent data review committee recommended discontinuing the doxazosin treatment arm based on comparisons with chlorthalidone. Therefore, the outcome data presented here reflect follow-up to December 1999.; A total of 625 centers across the United States and Canada.; A total of 24,335 patients (aged > or = 55 years) with hypertension and at least 1 other risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) who received either doxazosin or chlorthalidone; Participants were randomized to receive chlorthalidone, 12.5 to 25 mg/day (n=15,268), or doxazosin, 2 to 8 mg/day (n=9,067), for a planned follow-up of 4 to 8 years.; The primary endpoint was fatal CAD or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) analyzed by treatment intent; secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality, stroke, and composite cardiovascular disease (CAD death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, angina pectoris, coronary artery revascularization, congestive heart failure [CHF], and peripheral arterial disease); compared by chlorthalidone group vs. doxazosin group.; The median follow-up time was 3.3 years.

344,10798066,Evaluation and treatment of chronic renal failure.,,"Moudgil, A; Bagga, A","Chronic renal failure (CRF) is the irreversible deterioration of kidney function that gradually progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Major causes of CKD include obstructive uropathy, primary glomerular disease, reflux nephropathy, and hypoplastic or dysplastic kidneys. Progressive hyperperfusion and hyperfiltration leads to increasing glomerular damage and further kidney damage. CKD symptoms usually appear when GFR is between 10 and 25% of normal. Children with severe CRF often suffer from failure to thrive, growth retardation, acidosis, anemia, and renal osteodystrophy. Treatment of CKD aims to delay the progression of kidney damage and to treat complications related to kidney dysfunction. Measures suggested to delay progression include protein restriction, tight control of hypertension, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and control of hyperlipidemia. Adequate amounts of protein and calories are recommended to prevent stunted growth. Dietary supplements are often required. The availability of recombinant erythropoietin, calcitriol and human growth hormone has greatly improved the management of these patients. Once ESRD is added, renal replacement therapy in the form of chronic peritoneal or hemodialysis and transplantation is required.",0,0

In rats, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril, crosses the blood-brain barrier and increases striatal dopamine synthesis and release. In humans, angiotensin type 1 receptors have been found on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum. In Parkinson's disease there is a marked reduction in these receptors associated with nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron loss.; We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover pilot study in seven patients to investigate the effect of the ACE inhibitor perindopril on the clinical features of moderate Parkinson's disease.; After a four-week treatment period with perindopril, patients showed a faster onset of their motor response to L-dopa and a reduction in on-phase peak dyskinesia, p=0.021 and p=0.014, respectively. Patients also reported more “on” periods during their waking day in their exercise diary, p=0.007. Perindopril was well tolerated without significant orthostatic hypotension or renal dysfunction.; These results suggest that ACE inhibitors such as perindopril may have a place in the treatment of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease and warrant further studies.",0,0

Before treatment and after 2 months treatment with fosinopril 10 mg/day, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at rest and during a mental arithmetic test. In addition, exercise testing using the Bruce protocol was performed before and after treatment, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at rest and during peak exercise. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired t-test. In the mental arithmetic test, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced after 2 months of treatment with fosinopril (p<0.005 and p<0.001, respectively). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also significantly reduced during exercise testing (p<0.005 and p<0.05) after treatment.

Therefore, we wanted to determine whether the effects of ACE inhibitors on prostaglandin production in patients with essential hypertension are class effects or depend on the structure of the ACE inhibitors. In addition, we examined whether hypertensive patients have an impaired ability to synthesize vasodilator prostaglandins. To answer these questions, we compared the effects of captopril (sulfhydryl-containing inhibitor), enalapril and ramipril (carboxyl-containing inhibitor) and fosinopril (phosphoryl-containing inhibitor) on blood pressure and urinary excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG ). F1-alpha (the breakdown product of prostacyclin) in 44 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension before and 8 weeks after administration of an ACEI. We also examined prostacyclin clearance in 15 normotensive healthy controls. Urinary 6-keto-PGF1-alpha concentrations (pg/ml) were measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. Hypertensive patients had lower excretion of 6-keto-PGF1-alpha than normal blood pressure controls (212 +/- 147 vs. 353 +/- 98 pg/mL, p<0.001). All ACEI induced a significant decrease in MAP and increased the excretion rate of the prostacyclin metabolite: C, 211 +/- 200 to 338 +/- 250 pg/mL, p<0.05; E, 202 +/- 133 to 296 +/- 207 pg/mL, p<0.05; R, 205 +/- 127 to 342 +/- 211 pg/mL, p<0.05; F, 235 +/- 128 to 347 +/- 241 pg/mL, p<0.05. In hypertensive subjects (n=44), blood pressure reduction was negatively correlated with the increase in 6-keto-PGF1-alpha excretion (r=-0.51, p<0.001). These data suggest that impaired prostacyclin biosynthesis in hypertensive patients may be responsible for hemodynamic changes leading to the hypertensive state. In addition, ACEI's antihypertensive mechanisms may be mediated through an increase in prostacyclin production; this effect appears to be class dependent.",0,0
348,10803861,"Losartan: an overview of its use, with a special focus on elderly patients.",,"Simpson, K L; McClellan, K J","Losartan is an orally active, non-peptide, selective angiotensin subtype 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist. It provides a more specific and complete blockade of angiotensin II action than renin or ACE inhibitors. Short-term clinical studies (up to 12 weeks in duration) have shown that losartan is as effective as the recommended doses of captopril in reducing blood pressure (BP) [causing a decrease in BP < or = 26/20 mmHg] in elderly patients with hypertension , atenolol, enalapril, felodipine and nifedipine. In patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), the efficacy of losartan was similar to that of atenolol. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to losartan therapy results in greater antihypertensive efficacy, consistent with that observed with captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide. Preliminary evidence also suggests that losartan therapy contributes to the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy associated with chronic hypertension. Losartan increases exercise capacity in patients with either asymptomatic or symptomatic heart failure. The results of the Losartan Heart Failure Survival or ELITE II study (Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly II) indicate that there is no statistically significant difference between losartan and captopril in reducing all-cause mortality or reducing sudden cardiac death and/or resuscitated Cardiac arrest occurred in patients with heart failure. Apart from ELITE II, there are few reliable long-term mortality and morbidity data for losartan. Further long-term studies evaluating the survival benefits of losartan in elderly patients with hypertension, kidney disease or after an acute myocardial infarction are ongoing. In elderly hypertensive patients, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions associated with once-daily dosing of losartan (alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide) [19-27%] was similar to that of felodipine (23%) and nifedipine (21%). Losartan tended to be better tolerated than captopril (11 vs. 16%). Losartan was also better tolerated than atenolol in patients with ISH (10.4 vs. 23%). In patients with heart failure, the renal tolerability of losartan was similar to that of captopril, however, due to side effects, losartan was associated with a lower rate of withdrawal. No dose adjustment is required in elderly or patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and the risk of hypotension at the first dose is low. Comparative data have shown that losartan is as effective as other antihypertensive drugs in treating elderly patients with high blood pressure. Treatment with losartan is therefore an option for first-line therapy in all patients with hypertension, particularly in patients who are not well managed or who are intolerant to their current therapy. Morbidity and mortality data from the Losartan Heart Failure Survival (ELITE II) study show that losartan has potential in the treatment of heart failure.",0,0

However, the influence of the method and the use of normalized power units in long-term ECG monitoring is still debated. Autoregressive and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectral approaches were used to assess circadian modulation and the effect of beta-blocker administration in patients with mild hypertension undergoing continuous ambulatory ECG recording (n=44, 51+/ - 12 years, 30 men). Spectral analysis was applied to 5-minute sequences and spectral parameters representative of each circadian period (24 hours, day, night) were calculated. In baseline recordings, the FFT spectral method provided a smaller estimate of total power and power at very low frequencies. In contrast, low- and high-frequency components were systematically larger with FFT. Circadian variations suggested increased nocturnal total variability but reduced low-frequency normalized power for both spectral methods. Irrespective of the spectral approach, chronic oral administration of beta-blockers induced an increase in all spectral components except for an unchanged low-frequency normalized power. Despite quantitative differences, the qualitative assessment of circadian patterns and the beta-blockade effect by autoregressive and FFT-based spectral analysis are equivalent. The low-frequency component of heart rate variability cannot be considered a reliable direct marker of sympathetic nervous system activity in ambulatory Holter recording.",0,0

We conducted the ELITE II Losartan Heart Failure Survival Study to confirm whether losartan is superior to captopril in improving survival time and is better tolerated.; We conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled study in 3,152 patients 60 years of age or older with New York Heart Association class II-IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less. Patients stratified for beta-blocker use were randomized to receive losartan (n=1578) titrated to 50 mg once daily or captopril (n=1574) titrated to 50 mg three times daily. The primary and secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality and sudden death or failure to resuscitate. We evaluated safety and tolerability. The analysis was intended to treat.; The median follow-up time was 555 days. There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality (11.7 vs. 10.4% mean annual mortality rate) or sudden death or non-resuscitation (9.0 vs. 7.3%) between the two treatment groups (hazard ratios 1.13 [95 .7% CI 0.95-1.35], p=0.16 and 1.25 [95% CI 0.98-1.60], p=0.08).

Twenty-nine patients with renal parenchymal disease and hypertension were enrolled in the prospective, open-label, parallel study, which included a 14-day washout period followed by a 120-day treatment period. Patients were randomized to receive either losartan 50-100 mg/day (n=15) or enalapril 2.5-10 mg/day (n=14) to achieve blood pressure control <140/90 mmHg. Blood pressure, hemorheological profile and plasma fibrinogen concentration were measured after the washout period and after 2, 10, 60 and 120 days of treatment. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Twenty-seven patients completed the study. Treatment with both losartan and enalapril was associated with a significant decrease (P<0.05) in whole blood relative viscosity at high shear rate, indicating an increase in blood cell deformability. In patients taking losartan, the increase in blood cell deformability did not result in a decrease in mean whole blood viscosity due to a concomitant, significant increase in mean plasma viscosity (P<0.01). In contrast, in patients treated with enalapril, improved cell deformability resulted in a small and non-statistically significant decrease in mean whole blood viscosity (P=0.06; mean change=-0.15 mPas). The mechanism of increase in blood cell deformability and increase in plasma viscosity associated with losartan remains unclear. It is possible, but not proven, that the improvement in intrinsic blood cell rheology with losartan and enalapril may be the result of changes in cation transport systems and/or the protective antioxidant properties of drug metabolites.",0,0

Of the 191 patients enrolled, 183 completed 8 weeks of double-blind therapy. The mean age was 72-73 years. Lying and standing blood pressure at the end of the placebo run-in period was 173/96 vs. 168/96 mm Hg. Blood pressure values were measured in the morning 20-25 h after the previous day's dose (ie at the end of the dosing interval). In the placebo group, supine and standing diastolic blood pressure fell by 3-4 mmHg and systolic blood pressure by 6-7 mmHg. In the perindopril group, diastolic blood pressure decreased by 6-7 mm Hg and systolic blood pressure by 10-13 mm Hg (both p<0.01 vs. placebo). These data indicate a significant placebo response, particularly of systolic blood pressure in elderly hypertensive subjects, and indicate the importance of a parallel placebo group to assess the magnitude of the actual drug effect. Perindopril caused an additional reduction of approximately 2 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure and 4-5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure.

These false-negative photopatch test results can be attributed to the drug's inability to penetrate the epidermis. To improve the penetration of the tested drug into the epidermis, some authors suggested breaking the skin barrier. We conducted a prospective study comparing photopatch and photoscratch testing. Fifteen patients with systemic drug-induced photosensitivity evidenced by a favorable outcome after drug discontinuation were tested. Photopatch and photoscratch tests were performed for each drug. Two thirds of the patients had negative photopatch and photoscratch tests with the suspect drugs. Photopatch and photoscratch tests were positive and relevant in 3 and 4 patients, respectively. Photoscratch testing induced more false positives due to irritation than were confirmed in controls. Our study proves that photoscratch tests do not change the sensitivity of phototests.",0,0

Previous studies combining short-acting drugs from these classes have required multiple dosing and have been associated with poor compliance. The availability of longer acting compounds allows for once daily administration to avoid the inconvenience of multiple daily dosing. It was decided to conduct a randomized, double-blind, crossover study of the long-acting calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the long-acting ACE inhibitor lisinopril administered either alone or in combination in essential hypertension. Twenty-four patients with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 104 mm Hg received amlodipine 2.5 mg and 5 mg, lisinopril 5 mg and 10 mg and their combination according to a previous randomization schedule. Lying and standing blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at weekly intervals. Higher doses of both drugs alone or in combination were used when the supine DBP target was below 90 mm Hg. There was a significant additional blood pressure lowering effect with the combination compared to either amlodipine or lisinopril alone. Amlodipine 5 mg and lisinopril 10 mg monotherapy achieved blood pressure goal in 71% and 72% of patients, respectively.

Most reports do not provide a definition of “additive” nor the information necessary to determine if the effects are additive. In this review of the medical literature, the effects of combination therapy were defined as additive when the sum of the mean blood pressure reductions after monotherapy with a CCB and an ACE inhibitor were not significantly different from the mean blood pressure reductions from the combination therapy. The review generally showed that the combination therapy was more effective than monotherapy treatment alone, based on mean decreases in diastolic or systolic blood pressure.

361,10826395,Practitioner's Trial on the Efficacy of Antihypertensive Treatment in the Elderly Hypertension (The PATE-Hypertension Study) in Japan.,,"Ogihara, T","Patients 60 years and older with essential hypertension were treated for 3 years with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), delapril (Adecut) or a long-acting calcium (Ca) antagonist, manidipine (Calslot). The incidence of cardiovascular events and drug-related side effects were compared between the two groups to investigate whether both classes of antihypertensive drugs are beneficial in elderly hypertensive patients. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the two intervention groups, with the exception of slightly lower blood pressure (p=0.08) in the Ca antagonist group at baseline. There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality between the two groups. Cardiovascular events (both fatal and non-fatal) were reported in 34 of 699 patients (22.5/1000 patient-years) in the ACE-I group and in 50 of 1049 patients (19.7/1000 patient-years) in the Ca-antagonists group found no significant difference found between the two groups. The correlation between cardiovascular incidence and blood pressure achieved during treatment showed a J-shaped phenomenon, suggesting that excessive reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) to less than 120 mm Hg is unnecessary and can be harmful in certain cases. Side effects occurred more frequently in the ACE I group than in the Ca antagonist group (p = 0.01). Cough was the main adverse reaction, occurring in 5.0% of patients in the ACE I group. In conclusion, the study indicates that both ACE-I (delapril) and the Ca antagonist (manidipine) were equally beneficial in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in elderly hypertensive patients. However, the tolerability of ACE-I was lower due to the cough side effect.",1,0

Women aged 40 to 69 years with a seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95 to 115 mmHg were randomized to candesartan cilexetil, 8 to 16 mg (n=140), enalapril, 10 to 20 mg (n=146). ) or HCTZ, 12.5–25 mg (n=143), for 12 weeks; the higher doses were used when the DBP was above 90 mm Hg at 6 weeks. Candesartan cilexetil reduced sitting blood pressure by 17/11 and 19/11 mmHg after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment, respectively. This reduction was greater (P<0.01) than with enalapril (12/8 and 13/9 mm Hg) or HCTZ (12/7 and 13/8 mm Hg). The proportions of patients with controlled DBP (< 90 mm Hg) after 12 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil, enalapril or HCTZ were 60%, 51% and 43%, respectively. Patients had fewer dry coughs (p<0.001) on candesartan cilexetil or HCTZ than on enalapril. No treatment differences were found with respect to the incidence of dizziness and quality of life was well preserved in all groups. Compared to candesartan cilexetil and enalapril, HCTZ increased uric acid and decreased serum potassium (p<0.001). In conclusion, candesartan cilexetil was more effective in lowering blood pressure and better tolerated than enalapril or HCTZ in women with mild to moderate hypertension.",0,0

The 1292 subjects in the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study receiving single drug therapy for hypertension were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 6 active drugs (n=1105) or placebo (n=187). Treatment success was defined as maintaining a diastolic blood pressure of less than 95 mmHg for at least 1 year. We compared treatment success rates for blood pressure control and side effects of placebo versus active treatment. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we also compared rates of discontinuation of placebo versus active drug treatment over time as a result of adverse drug reactions and blood pressure exceedances of safety limits.; At the end of the titration phase, 58 patients treated with placebo (31%) achieved a target diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg and 57 (30%) achieved success at 1 year. Older white patients who received placebo had a 38% success rate versus 23% to 27% for the other subgroups in the age group.

365,10829361,Doxazosin in elderly patients with hypertension.,,"Weinberger, M H; Fawzy, A","Hypertension is an important cardiovascular risk factor with a high prevalence in the elderly and lowering of elevated blood pressure has been shown to be of significant benefit in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in this patient population. Elderly patients are more likely to have comorbid conditions such as dyslipidemia, diabetes, kidney disease, atherosclerosis, and in men, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Therefore, when choosing an antihypertensive drug for elderly patients, it is particularly important to ensure that the treatment does not aggravate comorbidities and does not have harmful interactions with concomitant medications. The alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist doxazosin has been shown to be an effective, well-tolerated antihypertensive therapy in elderly male patients and does not aggravate—and in some cases improves—some other common conditions. Doxazosin has been shown to be effective in reducing the symptoms of BPH in elderly patients whose blood pressure is well controlled on concomitant antihypertensive medications. In addition, improvements in BPH symptoms and reductions in blood pressure have been observed in older men with mild to moderate hypertension. Doxazosin has been shown to have beneficial effects on lipid profiles and glycemic control, making it an attractive therapeutic option for elderly patients with hypertension and diabetes or dyslipidemia. Additionally, doxazosin is administered once a day, either in the morning or in the evening, which may aid compliance, which is important in the elderly.",0,0
366,10830252,Risk-benefit ratio of angiotensin antagonists versus ACE inhibitors in end-stage renal disease.,,"Sica, D A; Gehr, T W; Fernandez, A","Effective treatment of hypertension is an extremely important consideration in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Almost any class of drugs—with the possible exception of diuretics—can be used to treat hypertension in patients with ESRD. Despite such a wide range of treatment options, drugs that disrupt the renin-angiotensin axis are generally suggested as the drugs of choice in this population, although evidence supporting their preferred use is fairly sparse. ACE inhibitors and, more recently, angiotensin antagonists are the two classes of drugs most commonly used to alter the activity of the renin-angiotensin axis to achieve blood pressure control. The use of ACE inhibitors in patients with ESRD can sometimes prove challenging. ACE inhibitors are dialyzed in a variety of ways, with compounds such as catopril, enalapril, lisinopril and perindopril undergoing significant cross-dialyzer clearance during a standard dialysis session. This phenomenon makes the selection of a dose and timing of administration for an ACE inhibitor a complex issue in patients with ESRD. In addition, ACE inhibitors are known to have a number of non-pressor effects that are relevant to patients with ESRD. Such effects include their ability to reduce thirst and reduce erythropoiesis. In addition, ACE inhibitors have a unique side effect profile. As with use in patients without renal insufficiency, use of ACE inhibitors in patients with ESRD may be associated with cough and, less commonly, with angioneurotic oedema. In the ESRD population, the use of ACE inhibitors is also accompanied by so-called anaphylactoid dialyzer reactions. Angiotensin antagonists are similar to ACE inhibitors in their antihypertensive mechanism. Angiotensin antagonists are not dialysable and can therefore be distinguished from a number of ACE inhibitors. In addition, the side effect profile of angiotensin antagonists is remarkably mild, with cough and angioneurotic edema occurring rarely, if ever. In patients with ESRD, angiotensin antagonists are also not associated with the anaphylactoid dialyzer reactions seen with ACE inhibitors. The non-pressor effects of angiotensin antagonists - such as an effect on thirst drive and erythropoiesis - have not been studied nearly as extensively as for ACE inhibitors. Although ACE inhibitors have not been directly compared to angiotensin antagonists in patients with ESRD, angiotensin antagonists possess a number of pharmacokinetic and adverse reaction characteristics that would favor their use in this population.",0,0

The present study was designed to assess whether beta-adrenoceptor antagonist-based or ACE inhibitor-based treatment was able to reduce carotid artery wall hypertrophy by reducing carotid PP rather than by reducing mean blood pressure to reduce, and whether the influence of a local PP reduction could also be demonstrated at the site of a muscular artery, the radial artery.; Ninety-eight patients with essential hypertension were randomized to 9 months of double-blind treatment with either celiprolol or enalapril. Arterial parameters were determined using high-resolution echo tracking systems. PP was measured locally using applanation tonometry and independently of mean blood pressure. After 9 months of treatment, mean blood pressure, carotid PP and intima-media thickness (IMT) decreased significantly, with no difference between the two groups. Reduction in carotid PP, but not mean blood pressure, was an important independent determinant of reduction in carotid IMT. Radial artery IMT and PP decreased significantly with both treatments. However, the reduction in radial artery IMT was unrelated to the changes in radial artery PP.; The regression of carotid artery wall hypertrophy during long-term antihypertensive treatment was dependent on the reduction in local blood pressure rather than the reduction in mean blood pressure.

Aspirin inhibits the synthesis of vasodilator prostaglandins and in principle this inhibition could antagonize some of the effects of ACEi. However, it is uncertain whether this affects the effects of ACEi on mortality and major morbidity after MI in practice; This review sought individual patient data from all studies with more than 1,000 patients who were randomly assigned to treatment with ACEi or control, starting in the acute phase of MI (0-36 h after onset) and continuing for four to six weeks. Data on ASA concomitant use were available for 96,712 of 98,496 patients in four eligible studies (and none of 1,556 patients in the one other eligible study).; The 30-day all-cause mortality was 7.1% in the ACEi patients and 7.6% in the control patients, corresponding to a proportional reduction of 7% (standard deviation [SD], 2%) (95% confidence interval 2% to 11%, p=0.004). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were associated with similar proportional reductions in 30-day mortality in the 86,484 patients taking ASA (6% [SD, 3%] reduction) and in the 10,228 patients who did not (10% [SD, 5%] Reduction: Chi-square test of heterogeneity between these reductions = 0.4; p = 0.5). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of persistent hypotension (17.9% ACE inhibitors vs. 9.4% control) and renal dysfunction (1.3% ACE inhibitors vs. 0.6% control), but there was no good evidence that these effects were different in the presence or absence of ASA (chi-square for heterogeneity = 0.4 and 0.0, respectively; both not significant).

372,10842896,The role of angiotensin II receptors and their antagonists in hypertension.,,"van Zwieten, P A","The octapeptide angiotensin II is the main effector of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Angiotensin II causes a number of potentially deleterious biological effects, such as vasoconstriction, increase in blood pressure, release of aldosterone, potentiation of catecholamine effects, and vascular and myocardial hypertrophy, including cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction. All of these deleterious effects of angiotensin II are mediated through angiotensin II (AT) receptors of the AT1 subtype. The functional effects of AT2 receptors, which have been characterized using biochemical techniques, have not yet been unequivocally identified. It is believed that stimulation of the AT2 receptor by angiotensin II counteracts vascular/myocardial remodeling and possibly induces vasodilation. Accordingly, it is believed that AT1 and AT2 receptors produce opposite effects. It has drawn attention to the fact that fetal tissue contains a high density of AT2 receptors that is significantly reduced after birth. The identification and analysis of AT receptors has been greatly stimulated by the development of non-peptidergic AT1 receptor antagonists, of which losartan is the prototype. So far it is unclear whether AT receptors are activated in hypertensive disorders. A review is given of the hemodynamic effects of AT1 receptor antagonists, their interaction with AT receptors, and the likely important role of the sympathetic nervous system involved in the antihypertensive action of AT receptor antagonists.",0,0

However, the evidence for the latter effect does not stand up to close scrutiny. We evaluated the effect of the ACE inhibitor trandolapril on M in 16 patients (mean +/- SD age 58 +/- 10.6 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension (baseline blood pressure 173 +/- 14.5/93 +/- - 8.0 mm Hg), obesity (body mass index, 30 +/- 5.4 kg/m2) and impaired glucose intolerance (n = 4) or type 2 diabetes (n = 12) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. All patients underwent three 3-hour euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies (soluble insulin, 1.5 mU/kg x min) after a 2-week placebo run-in period and at the end of two 4-week treatment periods with trandolapril 2 mg or placebo ( 2 week washout). M (mean +/- SD) did not change with trandolapril: placebo (run-in), 5.2 +/- 1.98 mg/kg x min; placebo, 5.3 +/- 1.70 mg/kg x min; trandolapril, 5.1 +/- 1.65 mg/kg x min; P = 0.58; 95% confidence interval, -0.74, 0.43 (trandolapril vs. placebo); 95% power to rule out an 8% increase in M.

374,10845831,Chronic proteinuric nephropathies: outcomes and response to treatment in a prospective cohort of 352 patients with different patterns of renal damage.,,"Ruggenenti, P; Perna, A; Gherardi, G; Benini, R; Remuzzi, G","The Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy (REIN) study found that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduced proteinuria, decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (DeltaGFR), and the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in patients with chronic Proteinuria effectively reduced nephropathies. In this study, we prospectively examined the major clinical determinants of progression and response to treatment in the 352 patients enrolled in the REIN study. The mean DeltaGFR (0.56 +/- 0.05 [SEM] versus 0.21 +/- 0.05 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/month; P = 0.0001) and the incidence of ESRD (30% and 10%; P=0.0001) were greater than twice that in subjects with proteinuria of 2 g/24 h or more protein compared to subjects with proteins less than 2 g/24 h ( relative risk [RR], 4.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.20 to 7.52) , and in patients with hypertension versus normotonia (mean DeltaGFR, 0.48 +/- 0.05 versus 0 .22 +/- 0.05 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/mon P=0.0006 ESRD, 25% versus 10% P=0.004 RR: 3.18 95% CI : 1.38 to 7.32). Hypertension at study entry (p=0.038), higher mean blood pressure at follow-up (p=0.002), and urinary protein excretion rate (p=0.0001) were independent predictors of faster DeltaGFR. DeltaGFR was approximately twice as fast in patients with type 2 diabetes as in patients with primary glomerular disease (P=0.002; including immunoglobulin A [IgA] nephropathy, P=0.009); Nephrosclerosis (p=0.03), adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD), or chronic interstitial nephritis (p=0.006). Diabetes at study entry (P=0.02) and higher mean blood pressure (P=0.0001) and urinary protein excretion rate (P=0.0001) at follow-up were independent predictors of faster DeltaGFR. After correction for baseline covariates, diabetes was also associated with an increased risk of progression to ESRD (RR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.01 to 5.68; p<0.05). In multivariate analyses, ramipril significantly reduced DeltaGFR (regression coefficient, -0.23 +/- 0.11 [SEM]; P=0.036) and ESRD (RR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.57; P = 0.008) in patients with baseline proteinuria of 2 g/24 h or more protein, and the renoprotective effect increased with increasing proteinuria. Ramipril reduced DeltaGFR to a similar extent in normotensive and hypertensive patients (-0.14 +/- 0.11 vs. -0.14 +/- 0.09) and significantly limited ESRD in hypertensive patients (RR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.26 to 3.26; P=0.004). DeltaGFR was reduced by 42% (p=0.017) in primary glomerular disease, 35% in IgA nephropathy, and 37% in nephrosclerosis, but did not improve in type 2 diabetes, APKD, or interstitial nephritis. In multivariate analyses, ramipril significantly slowed DeltaGFR (-0.24 +/-0.08; P=0.004) and progression to ESRD (RR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.36 to 3.96; P= 0.002) in patients without diabetes but not in patients with diabetes, who tended to have faster DeltaGFR (+0.62 +/- 0.44) on ramipril therapy. In summary, patients with proteinuria of 2 g/24 h or more protein, pre-existing hypertension, or type 2 diabetes were faster progressors. Higher blood pressure and degree of proteinuria were the strongest determinants for a more rapid decrease in GFR. The renoprotective effect of ramipril was similar in normotonic and hypertensive patients. Hypertensive patients and those with proteinuria of 2 g/24 h or more protein, primary glomerular disease, or nephrosclerosis benefited most from treatment with ACE inhibitors. During the study period, those with proteinuria less than 2 g/24 h protein, type 2 diabetes, or polycystic kidney disease did not benefit significantly from treatment.",0,0

Studies such as the Hypertension Optimal Treatment study attempted to identify optimal targets for long-term blood pressure control. Although unsuccessful in this primary goal, they have demonstrated the safety of aggressively lowering blood pressure to diastolic targets less than 80 mmHg and the safety and efficacy of a calcium-entry blocker as the first-line antihypertensive approach. The Captopril Prevention Project study and the Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension-2 study focused on whether the newer agents (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium-entry blockers) compared to beta-blockers and diuretics in comparative studies conventional therapy could have specific antiatherosclerotic benefits.

In patients with heart failure, the maximum pharmacodynamic effects are produced 6-8 hours after drug administration and last for 12-24 hours. High doses (32.5 to 35 mg given once daily) of lisinopril showed clinically meaningful advantages over low doses (2.5 to 5 mg given once daily) of lisinopril in the ATLAS (Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival) study drug in the treatment of congestive heart failure. High doses of lisinopril were more effective than low doses in reducing the risk of serious clinical events in patients with heart failure treated for 39 to 58 months. Compared with low-dose recipients, those receiving high-dose lisinopril had an 8% lower risk of all-cause mortality (p=0.128), a 12% lower risk of death or hospitalization from any cause (p=0.002), and 24% fewer heart failure hospitalizations (p=0.002). These benefits came with significant cost savings. In short-term (generally 12 weeks), randomised, double-blind, multicentre clinical trials, lisinopril was significantly more effective than placebo and at least as effective as captopril, enalapril, digoxin and irbesartan in improving symptomatic endpoints. Scores and clinical status in patients with heart failure. Lisinopril is generally well tolerated in heart failure patients. In controlled clinical trials, the most common adverse events reported in recipients of the drug were dizziness, headache, hypotension and diarrhea. Overall, the adverse reaction profiles were similar in patients treated with high or low doses of lisinopril in the ATLAS study. However, high doses of lisinopril used in the ATLAS study were associated with a higher incidence of adverse events, particularly hypotension and worsening renal function; Nonetheless, these events were generally well managed by changing the dose of lisinopril or concomitant medications. Furthermore, despite the higher incidence of some adverse events with high lisinopril doses, the frequency of treatment discontinuations due to adverse events was the same in the high and low dose groups.; Lisinopril (in combination with diuretics and/or digoxin) offers symptomatic benefits in patients with congestive heart failure. The ATLAS study showed that high doses of lisinopril significantly reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of morbidity and mortality compared to low doses of the drug. Importantly, there was no clinically significant decrease in tolerability of the drug when using a high dose. Lisinopril is at least as effective and as well tolerated as other members of the ACE inhibitor class in the treatment of congestive heart failure.",0,0

OPTIME-CHF was a randomized controlled trial comparing a 48-hour infusion of Milrinone versus standard therapy in 951 patients recruited over a 2-year period. Patients were excluded if the investigator considered that their clinical condition required inotropic therapy. Patients were randomized within 48 hours of admission for an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure and received milrinone or placebo challenge for 48 hours. Of the patients, 43% were diabetic, 70% were receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, 25% were already receiving a beta-blocker, and 34% had atrial fibrillation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in length of hospital stay during index admission, subsequent readmissions, and days in hospital over the following 60 days. Subjective clinical assessment results were also no different. There was an average admission rate over the next year of one per patient in both groups. However, there was a significant increase in the incidence of persistent hypotension in the Milrinone group, which accounted for all of the increased rates of side effects with active therapy.

These patients had significantly higher systolic (137 vs. 125 mmHg, P < or = 0.001) and diastolic (83 vs. 77 mmHg, P < or = 0.001) blood pressure values, a higher prevalence of diabetes (41 vs. 18%, P < or = 0.001), a lower ejection fraction (26.2 vs. 27.3%, P < or = 0.05), and a higher level of CHF (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III/IV at 22 vs. 10 %, P < or = 0.001) than in patients without baseline proteinuria. Patients with proteinuria at baseline also had higher rates of hospitalization for CHF (relative risk 1.81 [95% CI 1.37-2.41], P=0.0001) and mortality (1.73 [1.34-2.24 ], P = 0.0001). Enalapril prevented clinical proteinuria in diabetics (0.38 [0.17-0.81], P=0.0123) but not in non-diabetics (1.43 [0.77-2.63], P=0 .2622) without baseline proteinuria.; Clinical proteinuria is an independent predictor of hospitalizations for CHF and mortality in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with LV dysfunction.

Another objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of both combinations. One hundred hypertensive patients with a systolic blood pressure of 140–209 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure of 90–119 mmHg were studied after 16 weeks of treatment with a fixed combination of verapamil SR 180 mg/trandolapril 2 mg (VT) or captopril 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (CH), both given once daily. Lipids and lipoproteins were determined in duplicate on 2 consecutive days. The study was completed by 80 patients. There was no statistically significant difference between the two combined regimens in terms of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol for the intention-to-treat population, measured at the end of each treatment period (3.44 +/- 0, 87 mmol/L with VT and 3.46 +/- 0.86 mmol/L with CH).

Uncontrolled patients received a fixed combination of quinapril/HCTZ 10/12.5, 20/12.5 and 20/25 mg with dose titration at 3 month intervals if blood pressure control was not achieved (day DBP < 90 mmHg). Overall, a profound and sustained reduction in blood pressure was observed at the end of the study. 24-hour BP decreased from 151 +/- 14/98 +/- 7 to 136 +/- 15/87 +/- 9 mmHg (p < 0.0001 at end of study vs. baseline); mean daytime blood pressure decreased from 155 +/- 14/104 +/- 7 to 140 +/- 15/91 +/- 10 mmHg (p < 0.0001 at the end of the study versus baseline). The overall control rate (mean daily DBP < 90 mmHg) and response rate (decrease in daily DBP > or = 10 mmHg) were 49% and 61%, respectively.

Significant mortality results from this condition and from stroke and ischemic heart disease, in which hypertension plays an important role. The aim of this study was to assess the evidence for clinically effective and inexpensive treatment of hypertension given the clinician's choice to administer an AT1 receptor blocker.; A cost-benefit analysis was carried out from the point of view of health care payers in the private sector. A predefined protocol defined the study scope, the comparator drugs (candesartan, losartan, valsartan and irbesartan) and the inclusion criteria for peer-reviewed data. Data on the clinical efficacy of the comparators, measured as achieved reductions (mmHg) in sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP), were extracted, statistically analyzed and reported. The combinability of the data from different clinical studies was confirmed by analysis of variance. A pharmacoeconomic model was developed by combining these clinical results with South African retail prices and testing the results at a 95% confidence level.; A significant difference in clinical efficacy was observed between the comparators, with the following mean reductions in SDBP observed: candesartan 10.57, irbesartan 9.07, losartan 8.89 and valsartan 7.11 mmHg. Candesartan proved to be significantly more effective than losartan. Valsartan proved to be less effective than the other 3 comparators. No significant difference was found between irbesartan and candesartan or losartan. The reduction in SDBP per R100 spent showed that candesartan was more cost-effective than the other comparators, for which there were no significant differences. Additional savings of R5.0 million per year could be realized by private healthcare funders for every 100,000 patients successfully treated with candesartan.; Significant differences exist for the comparator drugs both in the clinical and in the cost-effectiveness measurements used in this study.

406,10902066,Angiotensin II receptor antagonists: a review.,,"Dina, R; Jafari, M","Angiotensin II (AT-II) receptor antagonists are being reviewed. Research focused on blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) led to the discovery of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are effective in treating high blood pressure but with a high frequency of coughing and other side effects associated. AT-II receptor antagonists were developed as agents that would block the RAS more completely and thus reduce the side effects seen with ACE inhibitors. AT-II receptor antagonists include losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, candesartan, eprosartan, telmisartan, and tasosartan. Several clinical studies have shown that AT-II receptor antagonists are as effective as calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors in treating hypertension and produce fewer side effects. The side effects of AT-II receptor antagonists—dizziness, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, and gastrointestinal upset—occur at about the same frequency as placebo. [corrected]. All available AT-II receptor antagonists appear to be equally effective in lowering both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and their cost is comparable. Currently, AT-II receptor antagonists are used either as monotherapy in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors, or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists are well tolerated and are as effective as ACE inhibitors in lowering blood pressure.",0,0

This observation opened intriguing possibilities relevant to the pathogenesis of nephropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus. To determine whether the effect of captopril was indeed mediated through a reduction in angiotensin II (Ang II) formation, we conducted another study using an Ang II antagonist, eprosartan, instead of captopril. Nine healthy volunteers with a high sodium balance (ie sodium intake 200 mmol/d) were examined. On day one, subjects received eprosartan 600 mg orally, and renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured. Glucose was infused intravenously on the second and third days of the study to increase plasma glucose below the threshold for glycosuria (approximately 8.8 mmol/L). Eprosartan at a dose of 600 mg or placebo was randomly administered on the second or third day of the study, 1 hour after the start of the glucose infusion. RPF increased (by 76 +/- 7 mL.min(-1), 1.73 m(-2), P<0.01) in response to sustained moderate hyperglycemia and then continued to increase (by 147 +/- 15 ml. min (-1) 1.73 m(-2), P<0.01) when eprosartan was administered during hyperglycemia. In contrast, eprosartan did not affect RPF and GFR in normoglycaemic subjects. GFR was not affected by either hyperglycemia or eprosartan. Neither plasma renin activity nor plasma Ang II concentration changed during hyperglycemia, suggesting that the hormonal responses responsible for the enhanced renal vasodilator response to eprosartan occurred in the kidney. The potentiation of the renal vasodilatory effect of eprosartan during hyperglycaemia is consistent with activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system.",0,0

411,10912746,"Comparison of three blood pressure measurement methods for the assessment of two antihypertensive drugs: feasibility, agreement and reproducibility of the blood pressure response.",,"Ragot, S; GenÃ¨s, N; Vaur, L; Herpin, D","Our aim was to compare three different methods of measuring blood pressure using the results of a controlled study comparing the antihypertensive effects of trandolapril and losartan. 229 hypertensive patients were randomized in a double-blind parallel group study. After a 3-week placebo period, they received either trandolapril 2 mg or losartan 50 mg once daily for 6 weeks. At the end of both the placebo and active treatment periods, three methods of blood pressure measurement were used: a) office blood pressure (three consecutive measurements); b) Self-monitoring of blood pressure at home (SBPM), consisting of three consecutive measurements taken at home in the morning and evening for 7 consecutive days; and c) ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM), 24-hour BP recordings with three measurements per hour. Of the 229 patients, 199 (87%) performed at least 12 valid SBPM measurements during both the placebo and treatment periods, while only 160 (70%) performed good-quality 24-hour ABPM recordings during both periods (p < 0.0001). One hundred and forty patients performed the three measurement methods well. At baseline and with treatment, the agreement between real-world measurements and the ABPM or SBPM was poor. Conversely, there was good agreement between ABPM and SBPM. The mean difference (SBP/DBP) between ABPM and SBPM was 4.6 +/- 10.4/3.5 +/- 7.1 at baseline and 3.5 +/- 10.0/4.0 +/- - 7.0 at the end of the treatment period. The correlation between SBPM and ABPM expressed by r-coefficient and P-values was as follows: at baseline 0.79/0.70 (<0.001/<0.0001), with active treatment 0.74/0.69 (0.0001/0.0001). The hourly and 24 hour reproducibility of the blood pressure response was quantified by the standard deviation of the BP response. Compared to office blood pressure, both global and hourly SBPM responses showed a lower standard deviation. The hourly reproducibility of the SBPM response (10.8 mm Hg/6.9 mm Hg) was lower than the hourly reproducibility of the ABPM response (15.6 mm Hg/11.9 mm Hg). In summary, SBPM was easier to perform than ABPM. There was good agreement between these two methods, while agreement between SBPM or ABPM and office measurements was poor. Because the hourly reproducibility of the SBPM response is better than the reproducibility of both the hourly ABPM and office BD responses, SBPM appears to be the most appropriate method for assessing residual antihypertensive effect.",0,0

The aim of this study was to test whether quinapril can interrupt this process and to analyze possible mechanisms. Of 138 patients with a mean infarct age of 56 months, 25 had asymptomatic progressive LV dilatation and were randomized to placebo or quinapril in a prospective, double-blind study. At baseline (mean +/- SEM), ejection fraction was reduced (35 +/- 3% and 39 +/- 3%) and end-diastolic volume (gated single photon emission computed tomography) was increased (104 +/- 9 and 117 +/- 12 ml/m(2)) with placebo (n = 13) or quinapril (n = 12). The progressive dilatation continued in patients on placebo (6 months: 9.4 +/- 5.2 mL/m(2), 12 months 24.6 +/- 5.4 mL/m(2); change vs baseline: p<0.05 vs. baseline; p<0.05 vs. 6 months), but not with quinapril (6 months: -0.9 +/- 4.0 ml/m(2); 12 months : 4.1 +/- 5.2 ml/m(2) [p<0.05] vs. placebo) . Wedge pressure during cycling was similar at baseline but tended to be lower at 12 months with quinapril (17 +/- 1 mm Hg) than with placebo (24 +/- 4 mm Hg, p=0.1673). Thus, quinapril prevented further progression of asymptomatic LV dilatation and remodeling after distant myocardial infarction, possibly due to attenuation of an exercise-induced increase in LV filling pressure.",0,0

These subjects were matched in a 1:3 ratio to a group of 66 subjects treated with enalapril 20 mg daily. The case-control sample was based on age (+/-5 years), gender, pre-treatment blood pressure (+/-5 mmHg) and ambulatory blood pressure (+/-5 mmHg), and treatment duration (+/-6 months). . An additional group of subjects who discontinued their treatment with enalapril (n=18) or losartan (n=2) due to adverse effects prior to conducting the follow-up study was not included in the analysis.; Hydrochlorothiazide was added during follow-up to optimize blood pressure control (office blood pressure < 140 mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic) in 10 subjects (45%) in the losartan group and 34 subjects (52%) in the enalapril group. Losartan and enalapril reduced blood pressure in the office and in the home to a similar extent. Left ventricular mass decreased from 98 to 87 g/m2 (2) with losartan (p<0.01) and from 98 to 89 g/m2 (2) with enalapril (p<0.01). The change in left ventricular mass over time was more closely associated with the change in ambulatory blood pressure than with office blood pressure in both groups. The inner diameter of the left ventricle did not change with any drug. Endocardial shortening fraction, midwall shortening fraction, and Doppler indices of active diastolic relaxation did not change with either drug. None of the biochemical parameters showed a significant change. Serum uric acid showed a slight and non-significant reduction in the losartan group only. In this case-control study in uncomplicated subjects with essential hypertension, losartan and enalapril alone or in combination with a diuretic efficaciously and equally reduced office and ambulatory blood pressure and induced a significant reduction in left ventricular mass during long-term treatment. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic function remained unchanged with both treatment regimens.",0,0

Patients with moderate or severe hypertension currently being treated with at least two single agents (excluding angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) with a seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 mm Hg and at least one adverse drug-related symptom randomized at once daily treatment with one of the combinations for 12 weeks. Losartan/HCTZ reduced seated DBP by 13.7 mm Hg and seated systolic blood pressure by 19.3 mm Hg from baseline on prior therapy; similar reductions occurred with enalapril/HCTZ. During sitting, DBP was reduced to normal (< 90 mm Hg) in 63% of patients who switched to the losartan combination and 58% of patients treated with the enalapril combination. Each combination was associated with improved tolerability compared to prior therapy, although fewer patients reported any of the 24 adverse events after 12 weeks of losartan/HCTZ. The improvement over prior therapy in the onset of cough was significantly greater with losartan/HCTZ (p=0.005). Enalapril/HCTZ, but not losartan/HCTZ, increased serum uric acid levels at week 12. In conclusion, the combination of losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg offers a beneficial therapeutic option for patients with a history of moderate to severe hypertension whose blood pressure is substandard controlled or who experience side effects while taking two or more antihypertensive drugs as single agents. In this patient population, switching from previous antihypertensive therapy to losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg once daily improves blood pressure control and reduces side effects.",0,0

The tolerability of these agents and their effect on the metabolic profile were also evaluated.; The study was a one-year, double-blind, prospective study of losartan and enalapril given alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide and other antihypertensive agents. ABP, renal and biochemical parameters were measured at baseline and after 12, 28 and 52 weeks of active treatment. Ninety-two hypertensive type 2 diabetics with early nephropathy completed the study.; Both losartan and enalapril, administered alone or in combination with other drugs, induced a significant reduction in seated exertion (P<0.05) and arterial blood pressure (P<0.002) with no statistical difference between groups. The geometric mean values for urinary albumin excretion (UAE) decreased significantly (p<0.001) from 64.1 to 41.5 micrograms/min in losartan-treated patients and from 73.9 to 33.5 in enalapril-treated patients micrograms/min after 52 weeks of therapy. In both groups, a significant relationship (P<0.05) was observed between the changes in systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure and the decrease in UAE at 52 weeks. The decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) stabilized at the end of therapy and was identical in both treatment groups. Treatment with enalapril was associated with a significantly higher incidence of cough (p=0.006) and an increase in serum uric acid (p=0.002) compared to losartan. Our results indicate that one year of antihypertensive therapy with either losartan or enalapril significantly reduces UAE in hypertensive type 2 diabetics with early nephropathy. The reduction in UAE with each treatment is similarly related to decreases in ABP. In addition, the rate of decrease in GFR is similar in both treatment groups.",0,0

The unfavorable genotype of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, including LVH. ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) reduce LVH, but little is known about the effects of ACE inhibitors on LVH in RT patients with different ACE gene insertion/deletion (I/D) genotypes.; We prospectively studied 57 stable nondiabetic RT patients with hypertension and echocardiographic LVH and a functional transplant for 69.5 +/- 5.6 months. Patients were randomized to receive either lisinopril 10 mg/day (Group A, N=29; 5 were excluded because of reversible acute renal failure) or placebo (Group B, N=28) for 12 months. Echocardiography (M-mode, 2-B and color flow Doppler) was performed at baseline, 6 and 12 months later by the same investigator without prior knowledge of genetic typing. The ACE genotype (I or D alleles) was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Group A, DD = 10 and ID/II = 14; Group B, DD = 15 and ID/II = 13); All patients maintained good renal function (serum creatinine < 2.5 mg/dl) during follow-up, and both groups received a similar proportion of antihypertensive drugs (beta-blockers 83 vs. 79%; Ca-antagonists 66 vs. 68%; alpha1-adrenoreceptor antagonists 50 vs. 67%) during the study. As expected, mean arterial blood pressure and hemoglobin levels showed a greater percentage reduction in Group A compared to Group B (-4 +/- 2.8 vs. 2.1 +/- 2.6%, P = 0.07 and -11.5 +/- 1.5 vs -0.5 +/- 2.3%, P<0.01). Group A patients showed a significantly greater decrease in LV mass index (LVMI) than Group B at the end of follow-up after adjusting for age, baseline LVMI, time post-transplant, and changes in systolic blood pressure, renal function, and hemoglobin levels (Group A, -9.5 +/- 3.5% vs. Group B, 3 +/- 3.2%, P<0.05). As a result, 46% of group A patients and only 7% of group B patients showed a reduction in LVMI >/= 15% (p<0.01). The beneficial effect of lisinopril on LVMI reduction was more evident in DD patients (placebo DD, 8.4 +/- 4.1% vs. lisinopril DD, -7.2 +/- 5.3, p<0, 05), and a trend was observed in patients with other genotypes (placebo ID/II, 2.8 +/- 5.4% vs. lisinopril ID/II, -11.4 +/- 5%, P=0, 33); Lisinopril reduces LVM in renal transplant patients with hypertension and LVH, and ACE gene polymorphism may predict the beneficial effect of this therapy.

Portal hemodynamics were determined before and after therapy (using an ultrasound duplex system). New Doppler portal indices were derived and the portal vein kinetic pressure was estimated for the first time using data derived from the ultrasound duplex system.; 1) Short-term endoscopic sclerotherapy alone resulted in a significant increase in portal vein kinetic pressure, wall stress index, and flow volume (P < 0.01) and a nonsignificant increase in total portal vein circulation resistance index (P > 0.05 ) and a significantly decreased portal vein venous compliance and distensibility indices (P < 0.05); 2) Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduced maximum and mean portal velocity, portal flow volume, total portal circulation resistance index and increased portal vein compliance and distensibility indices, therefore they reduced portal vein kinetic pressure significantly in group IV (P < 0.05 for the flow volume and P < 0.01 for other indices); 3) The only side effect that occurred was allergic cough (in 8.33% of patients). No effects were found on heart rate, systolic, diastolic or mean blood pressure, or Child-Pugh score of liver disease.; 1) Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, when added to endoscopic sclerotherapy, may improve the latter's effects on portal hemodynamics in patients with portal hypertension; 2) Portal Vein Kinetic Pressure, Total Portal Circulatory Resistance Index, Portal Vein Wall Stress Index, Compliance and Distensibility Indices are new Doppler portal indices that have proven valuable in the follow-up of patients with portal hypertension undergoing sclerotherapy alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy; 3) Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are safe drugs that can be used for portal decompression with endoscopic sclerotherapy.

The results of large (n > 100), randomized, double-blind studies in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hypertension showed that the antihypertensive efficacy of eprosartan (usually 400 to 800 mg/day as a single daily dose or in 2 divided doses) is significantly greater than that of placebo and at least as good as that of enalapril. In placebo-controlled studies, eprosartan produced mean reductions from baseline in systolic blood pressure of 6.3 to 15 mm Hg and in diastolic blood pressure of 4.1 to 9.7 mm Hg. Response rates for once-daily dosing of eprosartan 400 to 800 mg were approximately twice that of placebo. Overall, eprosartan was well tolerated, with a tolerability profile similar to placebo. In comparative studies evaluating the incidence of persistent dry cough as the primary endpoint, enalapril was several times more likely than eprosartan to cause this adverse event (the difference was statistical independent of the study population and the definition of cough). significant). . In summary, the angiotensin II receptor antagonist eprosartan is a well tolerated and potent antihypertensive drug administered once or twice daily with or without food. Eprosartan has a low potential for serious adverse events and the drug has not been associated with clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Unlike ACE inhibitors such as enalapril, eprosartan does not have a high propensity to cause persistent nonproductive cough. Therefore, eprosartan represents a useful therapeutic option in the management of hypertensive patients.",0,0

An annoying dry cough is the most common side effect of all angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Prostaglandins (PG) have been found to play a leading role in causing ACEI-associated cough. The role of varying doses of the most commonly used PG inhibitor - aspirin - in ACEI cough modification has not yet been elucidated. Of 350 consecutive patients treated with ACEI, we identified 34 (9.7%) nonsmoking ACEI-related coughs. Patients with lung disease, treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and those who did not agree to participate in the study were excluded. The remaining 14 ACEI coughs (eight males, six females; mean age 63 +/- 11 years) discontinued treatment; the dry cough disappeared completely but returned in all patients within 1 week after reintroduction of ACEI. At the end of the rechallenge period, patients started on a low-dose aspirin for one week and then switched to medium-dose aspirin for another week. Scores for cough severity (CS, 0-4) and frequency (CF, 0-10) were recorded at each visit. Low doses of aspirin were ineffective in suppressing ACEI-induced cough, while medium doses completely eliminated the cough in five patients and reduced the cough in all but one patient; CS and CF decreased from 2.5 +/- 1.0 to 0.9 +/- 1.1, P<0.002, and from 6.6 +/- 2.4 to 2.4 +/- 1.1, respectively , P<0.0002. Overall, intermediate doses of aspirin positively altered cough scores in 13 (93%) patients, allowing nine (64%) to continue ACEI treatment. Aspirin did not affect blood pressure control in either hypertensive or post-infarction patients. We conclude that moderate, but not low, doses of aspirin are likely to suppress ACEI-induced cough. These results suggest a new alternative therapeutic approach for patients with ACEI-related cough, particularly those for whom treatment with ACEI appears to be essential.",0,0

Patients were evaluated with Doppler echocardiography before treatment, after 3 and 6 months of treatment (either metoprolol or captopril), and 1 month after treatment discontinuation. Within- and between-investigator reproducibility was acceptable, with a coefficient of variation of less than 5% for LV dimensions. A reduction in LV dimensions was observed in both treatment groups. There was also an increase in LV stroke volume and fractional shortening in the metoprolol group. The non-invasive data were consistent with the invasive measurements of stroke volume and LV filling pressure. In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and mild to moderate symptoms of heart failure, echocardiography appeared to be sufficiently reproducible to be used to determine treatment effects in a longitudinal study of heart failure.

In adults, angiotensin II antagonists have antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects similar to those of converting enzyme inhibitors and an adverse event profile similar to placebo. There is no information on angiotensin II antagonists in children. A total of 20 children (aged 4 to 17 years) with chronic kidney disease received the angiotensin II antagonist irbesartan once daily. They had hypertension (n=11), overt proteinuria (n=3), or both (n=6).

After 4 weeks of placebo washout, hypertensive patients received 6 weeks of active antihypertensive therapy of either losartan 50 mg once daily (n=111) or captopril 25 mg twice daily for 1 week, which was increased to 50 mg twice daily for 5 weeks ( n=105). This was followed by one week of concomitant therapy with indomethacin (75 mg daily). The primary endpoint was the change in mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure following the addition of indomethacin. Both captopril and losartan significantly reduced ambulatory diastolic blood pressure after 6 weeks of therapy (losartan -5.3 mm Hg, P: <0.001; captopril -5.6 mm Hg, P: <0.001). Indomethacin significantly reduced 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure for both losartan (2.2 mm Hg, P: <0.05) and captopril (2.7 mm Hg, P: <0.001) and also reduced the effect of captopril on diastolic blood pressure in the trough seated position. The changes in diastolic blood pressure during the day (7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.) were similar to the 24-hour response in both groups. Nocturnal diastolic blood pressure (11:01 p.m. to 6:59 a.m.) was significantly reduced in captopril-treated patients (2.0 mm Hg, P: < 0.05), but losartan was unaffected (0.4 mm Hg) . Therefore, concomitant treatment with indomethacin similarly attenuates the 24-hour antihypertensive response to losartan and captopril.",0,0

The Efficacy Study of Celiprolol Intima-Media Enalapril].,,"Boutouyrie, P; Bussy, C; Tropeano, A I; Hayoz, D; Hengstler, J; Dartois, N; Laloux, B; Brunner, H; Laurent, S","Local pulse pressure (PP) is an independent determinant of carotid artery wall thickness, more so than mean blood pressure. The present study was designed to assess whether a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist or ACE inhibitor-based treatment was able to reduce carotid artery wall hypertrophy by reducing carotid PP rather than by reducing mean blood pressure , and whether the influence of local PP reduction could also be demonstrated at the site of a muscular artery, the radial artery; Ninety-eight patients with essential hypertension were randomized to 9 months of double-blind treatment with either celiprolol or enalapril. Arterial parameters were determined using high-resolution echo tracking systems. PP was measured locally using PP applanation tonometry and independently of mean blood pressure. After 9 months of treatment, mean BP, carotid PP and intima-media thickness (IMT) decreased significantly with no difference between the two groups. Reduction in carotid pulse pressure, but not mean blood pressure, was an important independent determinant of reduction in carotid IMT. Radial artery IMT and PP decreased significantly with both treatments. However, the reduction in radial artery IMT was unrelated to the changes in radial artery PP.; The regression of carotid artery wall hypertrophy during long-term antihypertensive treatment was dependent on the reduction in local blood pressure rather than the reduction in mean blood pressure. The effect of PP depression on IMT reduction was observed at the site of an elastic artery but not at the site of a muscular artery.",0,0

It was also possible to evaluate the agreement between the general practitioner's assessment of the cardiovascular risk and the calculated percentage.; The participation of 953 general practitioners in the study made it possible to estimate the absolute cardiovascular risk for 1,243 hypertensive patients. The patients were randomized into 2 groups depending on whether the physicians knew the calculated risk or not. The therapeutic strategy included monotherapy (fosinopril 20 mg/day) for a follow-up of 8 weeks, with the option to escalate treatment after 4 weeks (fosinopril + hydrochlorotiazide). To be admitted, patients had to be between the ages of 18 and 75 and have a blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg. The estimated and calculated cardiovascular risk at 10 years was classified according to the 1999 WHO-ISH guidelines: low risk < 15%, intermediate risk 15-20%, high risk 20-30%, very high risk > 30%.; In this population aged 60 +/- 10 years, with 54% males, the agreement between the estimated risk and the calculated risk was 35%. This concordance was better for 'low risk' and 'very high risk' but remains below 50%. The determinants of agreement were: gender (male), smoking and low HDL cholesterol. After 8 weeks of treatment, no difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of final blood pressure level, percentage of normalized patients, and number of patients on bi-therapy.; The general practitioner estimate of the cardiovascular risk at 10 years of hypertensive patients agrees poorly with the calculated risk according to Framingham's equation. The results of this study show that cardiovascular risk assessment in hypertensive patients does not change the management of hypertension.",0,0
451,10993857,Lisinopril-mediated regression of myocardial fibrosis in patients with hypertensive heart disease.,,"Brilla, C G; Funck, R C; Rupp, H","In arterial hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) includes myocytic hypertrophy and fibrosis, resulting in LV diastolic dysfunction and eventual cardiac failure. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, myocardial fibrosis decreased and LV diastolic function improved by treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril. Whether this applies to patients with hypertensive heart disease was investigated in this prospective, randomized, double-blind study.; A total of 35 patients with primary hypertension, LVH, and LV diastolic dysfunction were treated with either lisinopril (n=18) or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; n=17). LV catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy, Doppler echocardiography with measurements of peak LV flow velocities during early filling and atrial contraction and isovolumic relaxation time, and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring were performed at baseline and at 6 months. Myocardial fibrosis was measured by LV collagen volume fraction and myocardial hydroxyproline concentration. With lisinopril, collagen volume fraction decreased from 6.9 +/- 0.6% to 6.3 +/- 0.6% (p: < 0.05 versus HCTZ) and myocardial hydroxyproline concentration from 9.9 +/- 0 .3 to 8.3 +/- 0.4 micrograms/mg of LV dry weight (P: < 0.00001 vs. HCTZ); this was associated with an increase in the LV peak flow velocity ratio during early filling and atrial contraction from 0.72 +/- 0.04 to 0.91 +/- 0.06 (p: < 0.05 versus HCTZ) and a decrease in the isovolumic relaxation time from 123 +/- 9 to 81 +/- 5 ms (P: <0.00002 versus HCTZ). The normalized blood pressure did not change significantly in any of the groups. There was no LVH regression in patients treated with lisinopril, while myocyte diameter was reduced from 22.1 +/- 0.6 to 20.7 +/- 0.7 microns with HCTZ (p: < 0.01 vs. lisinopril) .; In patients with hypertensive heart disease, inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with lisinopril can reverse myocardial fibrosis independently of LVH regression and is accompanied by improved LV diastolic function.",0,0

Although most of these products are well tolerated, drug-induced hyperkalemia may develop in patients with underlying renal dysfunction or other potassium handling abnormalities. Drug-induced hyperkalemia most commonly occurs due to impaired renal potassium excretion. But it can also lead to a disturbed cellular absorption of a potassium load as well as to an excessive intake or infusion of substances containing potassium. Physicians need to be aware of the drugs that can induce hyperkalemia, how these drugs produce changes in potassium homeostasis, and patient characteristics that increase risk of hyperkalemia.",0,0

Patients were serially evaluated for serum ACE levels every week for 4 weeks. Thirty healthy individuals served as controls. The basal serum ACE level was significantly higher (p<0.001) in hypertensive subjects (57.4 +/- 37.2 u/l) than in controls (33.3 +/- 8.8 u/l). One week after the start of captopril therapy, serum ACE levels fell to almost half of basal levels (p<0.001). Thereafter, however, it rose to levels above baseline, although blood pressure remained well controlled. Our study suggests that captopril may lower blood pressure through other mechanisms besides its effect on ACE.",0,0

There were 10 men and 5 women ranging in age from 4 to 56 years. Three patients had hypertension. Histological lesions were focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in 8; membranous glomerulonephritis at 3; mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis in 2 and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 2 patients. Proteinuria ranged from 3.64 to 8.66 g/1.73 m2/day. Serum albumin was between 2.2 and 3.3 g/dl. Serum creatinine was increased to > 1.5 mg/dl in 3 cases. After stopping the steroids, enalapril was started at a dose of 2.5 mg/day and increased by 2.5 mg/day every 3-4 days up to the maximum tolerated dose, but not exceeding 20 mg/day. Proteinuria, serum albumin and serum creatinine were determined every 4 weeks for 6 months and every 3 months thereafter. The patients were followed up for 6 to 30 months. Proteinuria decreased to < 1.5 g/1.73 m2/day in 12 patients (80%) and < 0.5 g/1.73 m2/day in 10 patients (66.7%) at 8 weeks. In 3 (20%) patients there was no significant reduction in proteinuria; two of these were cases of FSGS and one of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hypercholesterolemia normalized in all patients in whom proteinuria decreased. There was no correlation between the histological lesion and the response to enalapril. No patient experienced an increase in serum creatinine levels above baseline. Apart from coughing in one patient, no other significant side effects were observed. We conclude that enalapril is effective in reducing proteinuria and hence morbidity in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome regardless of the underlying pathology.",0,0

The non-invasive assessment of endothelial function in patients with risk factors undergoing clinical management is an important medical advance. In this situation, the altered endothelial function in patients with coronary hypercholesterolaemia and its changes by treatment with enalapril and simvastatin, either individually or in combination, in the brachial artery was examined in a randomized, double-blind, 2-phase crossover study.; Thirty-eight patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 (18 patients, 3 women, mean age 63 +/- 6.0 years) received simvastatin 10 mg/day for 8 weeks and simvastatin plus enalapril 5 mg/day for an additional 8 weeks. Group 2 (20 patients, 3 women, mean age 64 +/- 5.8 years) received enalapril 5 mg/d for 8 weeks and enalapril 10 mg/d plus simvastatin for an additional 8 weeks. In all subjects, the diameter of the brachial artery before and after postischemic hyperemia was measured with high-resolution ultrasound in baseline conditions (control) and under the effect of drugs at the end of 8 and 16 weeks.; Cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels decreased significantly with treatment with simvastatin alone or with enalapril. The mean outlet arterial diameter was 5.24 +/- 1.25 mm in group 1 and 4.83 +/- 0.99 mm in group 2 (not significant). In group 1, after the first 8 weeks, endothelium-dependent vasodilation under simvastatin treatment increased significantly (control, 4.4%; 8 weeks, 7.6%; p<0.001). After 16 weeks with the addition of enalapril, a further increase in vasodilation was observed (8.6%, p<0.05 vs. 8 weeks).

This study was also a preliminary investigation of the pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Z13752A.; In this randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential study, two alternating groups of eight healthy male volunteers each (six subjects receiving active treatment + two subjects receiving placebo) were treated with escalating oral doses of Z13752A: 10, 50, 200, and 600 mg were given to Panel I and 20, 100, 400 and 800 mg were given to Panel II. The study was double-blind to placebo or active treatment and open-label to dose levels. The same volunteer received a placebo only once.; Single oral doses of Z13752A up to 800 mg were well tolerated. Only six mild to moderate side effects, mainly headache, were reported and appeared to be of little clinical relevance. After administration of 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg Z13752A, a non-significant drop in diastolic blood pressure was observed both when standing and when lying down. After single oral doses of Z13752A, ACE inhibition appeared significant at all doses tested, correlated linearly with dose, and was nearly complete at doses > or = 100-200 mg. NEP inhibition was indicated by an increase in ANP and cGMP plasma concentrations in almost all subjects. In the dose range of 200-800 mg, Z13752A caused a 50-100% increase in plasma cGMP levels and a 50-80% increase in urinary cGMP concentrations. Detectable plasma levels of Z13752A were found in all treated subjects. Z13752A was well and rapidly absorbed, with peak concentrations reached approximately 2.5 hours after administration.

In addition, two phase II clinical studies evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of telmisartan in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Telmisartan has been administered to young men as oral (1-160 mg) or intravenous (10-160 mg) doses. In another multiple-dose study, telmisartan was administered orally at 320 mg once daily for 7 days to healthy young male volunteers. Elderly subjects received oral telmisartan (20 and 120 mg) once daily for 7 days. Telmisartan doses of 10, 20, 40, 80, 120 and 160 mg were taken once daily for 7 days by patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In addition, hypertensive subjects were given oral telmisartan (40, 80, or 120 mg) once daily for 28 days. After oral administration, the median time to peak plasma concentrations of telmisartan was 0.5-2 hours, with peak plasma concentrations increasing more than proportionally with dose. In contrast, plasma concentrations were directly related to intravenous dose. Steady state was observed after 5-7 days of once daily dosing and there was no clinically relevant accumulation after 28 days. Plasma concentration-time profiles were similar in all study groups and were characterized by rapid absorption and a rapid biexponential decline after peak plasma concentration with a prolonged terminal elimination phase (> 20 h in healthy and hypertensive subjects). Telmisartan was well tolerated with a low incidence of drug-related adverse events. The most common event was headache, which was also seen in placebo-treated controls. No changes in heart rate, electrocardiogram, or clinical chemistry were observed after ingestion of telmisartan. The study thus shows that high, well-tolerated systemic levels of telmisartan can be achieved in healthy adults of all ages and in hypertensive subjects. The long terminal elimination half-life makes telmisartan suitable for once-daily dosing and contributes to sustained efficacy throughout the 24-hour dosing interval.",0,0

Following a standardized selection protocol based on well-defined drug-resistant hypertension or renal dysfunction during angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, patients underwent renal scintigraphy and a captopril-renin challenge test. A number of clinical features were also recorded. Sensitivity and specificity of renal scintigraphy to diagnose renal artery stenosis were 0.72 and 0.90 and of captopril-renin test 0.77 to 0.91 and 0.69 to 0.75, depending on the criterion used. The clinical characteristics were used to create a clinical prediction rule for renal artery stenosis, which had a sensitivity of 0.68 and a specificity of 0.87 with a cut-off of 30% of the predicted probability. However, a sensitivity of 0.90 could be achieved with the prediction rule by only performing arteriography in patients with a predicted probability of stenosis > or = 10%, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of arteriograms to be performed. A diagnostic strategy is recommended, beginning with drug-resistant hypertension and progressing to renal arteriography only in patients with an increased likelihood of stenosis. Patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis were then randomized to balloon angioplasty (n=56) versus antihypertensive medication (n=50). Three months after randomization, 22 patients from the medication group underwent balloon angioplasty as a second instance. In an intention-to-treat analysis, there was no difference in blood pressure between groups at either 3 months or 12 months of follow-up, although there was a small drug-sparing effect of balloon angioplasty. The lack of a positive effect of balloon angioplasty compared to medication could neither be attributed to the high rate of stenosis recurrence after angioplasty nor to the fact that the inclusion criterion was set to a degree of stenosis of > or = 50%, so that patients with relatively mild stenoses were also included locked in. Renal function after angioplasty was slightly better in the angioplasty group than in the medication group, and improvement in renal scintigram occurred more frequently after angioplasty. In addition to the treatment of patients with specific characteristics, the presented therapeutic approach begins with the extension of antihypertensive drug therapy to control blood pressure.

Antihypertensive drugs have differential effects on glucose and insulin metabolism (GIM) and on LVM. To assess whether the effects of antihypertensive therapy on LVM are related to their effects on GIM, we compared the effects of atenolol and perindopril on these parameters in a group of insulin-resistant, obese hypertensive subjects.; A total of 21 obese, non-diabetic hypertensive patients, aged 55 +/- 12 years, with a body mass index of 32.8 +/- 5.0 kg/m² (2), without coronary or valvular disease and with normal LV Function were randomized to treatment with atenolol (n=11) or perindopril (n=10). Echocardiographically corrected LVM (LVM/height) and GIM (3-hour intravenous glucose tolerance test) were measured after 4 to 6 weeks of washout and 6 months of treatment. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Atenolol and perindopril effectively reduced blood pressure (from 149+/-13/98+/-4 to 127+/-8/82+/-6 mmHg and from 148+/-9/98+/-4 to 129+) . /-9/82+/-6 mm Hg for the atenolol and perindopril groups, respectively; P: = 0.002).

We examined whether ACE inhibition improves endothelial function in such patients and compared the responses to those in healthy subjects.; We studied 23 healthy subjects (controls, age 29.8 [SD 7.0] years) and 24 patients with type 1 diabetes (age 28.7 [9.6] years; HbA1c 8.1 [1.2] %; diabetes duration 13.8 [2-30] years; blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg; 7 with microalbuminuria) after 5 weeks of ACE inhibition (quinapril, 10 mg day-1) and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, cross- over design. Estimates of endothelial function were obtained from flow-mediated vasodilation and plasma levels of endothelial-derived proteins.; As assessed by measurements with placebo, type 1 diabetics had some impairment of endothelial function compared to controls: plasma tissue plasminogen activator levels were lower (3.5 vs. 5.4 ng ml(-1), P<0 ,05), but there were no significant differences in brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation or plasma levels of von Willebrand factor, endothelin-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, soluble E-selectin, or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Compared to placebo, ACE inhibition increased flow-mediated vasodilation in controls (by 3.84 percentage points [95% CI, 0.66-7.02], p<0.05), but not in type 1 -diabetics (0.82 percentage points [95% CI, -2.72 - 4.36], P=0.64; P=0.08 vs. controls).

Other endothelial markers did not change during ACE inhibition.; Patients with normotensive type 1 diabetes with normoalbuminara or microalbuminuria have mild endothelial dysfunction. Short-term ACE inhibition improves endothelial function, which is reflected in decreased sE-selectin in healthy subjects and in normotensive type 1 diabetics. In healthy subjects, ACE inhibition increases flow-mediated vasodilation. In contrast, ACE inhibition in type 1 diabetics does not affect flow-mediated vasodilation.",0,0

No study has evaluated the comparative effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor versus an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) on changes in serum [K(+)] in people with renal impairment.; The study was a multicenter, randomized, double crossover design, each period lasting one month. A total of 35 people (21 males and 14 females, 19 African American and 16 Caucasian) with a mean age of 56 +/- 2 years participated. The mean baseline serum value [K(+)] was 4.4 +/- 0.1 mEq/L. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 65 +/- 5 mL/min/1.73 m2 and blood pressure was 150 +/- 2/88 +/- 1 mm Hg. The main endpoint was the difference from baseline in serum [K+], plasma aldosterone and GFR levels after the initial and crossover period.; For the whole group, the changes in serum [K(+)] were not significantly different between treatments with lisinopril or valsartan. The subgroup with GFR < or = 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) receiving lisinopril showed a significant increase in serum [K(+)] of 0.28 mEq/L above mean Baseline value of 4.6 mEq/L (p=0.00). 0.04). This increase in serum [K(+)] was also accompanied by a decrease in plasma aldosterone (P=0.003). Compared to the whole group, the change in serum [K(+)] from baseline to post-treatment in the lisinopril group was higher in those with GFR values < or = 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). However, the lower GFR group taking valsartan had a smaller increase in serum levels [K(+)], 0.12 mEq/L above baseline (P=0.1), a 43% lower value compared to of change in those receiving lisinopril. This attenuated increase in [K(+)] in subjects taking valsartan was not associated with a significant decrease in plasma aldosterone (P=0.14); In the presence of renal insufficiency, the ARB valsartan did not increase serum [K(+)] to the same extent as the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. This differential effect on serum [K(+)] is related to a relatively smaller reduction in plasma aldosterone by the ARB and is not related to changes in GFR. This study provides evidence that increases in serum [K(+)] in people with renal impairment are less likely with ARB therapy compared to ACE inhibitor therapy.",0,0

Enalapril was administered at doses of 0.2-0.6 mg/kg per day for 24-84 months and prednisone was introduced 2 months later in 11 patients at doses of 30 mg/m2 every other day. The electrophoretic protein pattern in urine showed a reduction of 80% and 70%, respectively, in total protein and albumin after enalapril. Total urine protein decreased from 5.46 to 1.1 g/m2 per day (P<0.001). A marked change from a pattern of non-selective urinary protein loss to albumin-selective proteinuria was observed.

Therefore, effective antihypertensive treatment is required. Calcium antagonists are used to treat hypertension because their mechanism of action allows them to induce both systemic and coronary vasodilation. In this study, the authors aimed to evaluate the activity and tolerability of diltiazem compared to ramipril in a group of elderly patients with essential arterial hypertension.; A controlled, single-blind study was conducted in which patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups, A and B, each consisting of 25 patients, each treated with 300 mg extended-release diltiazem or 5 mg ramipril in treated with a single daily dose. The study lasted 6 months and assessed systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate.; Development was positive in all patients in Group A and most patients in Group B, with normalization in both systolic and diastolic values. Heart rate showed a more sustained drop in Group A, which was expected based on diltiazem's mechanism of action. No patient in group A had to discontinue treatment, whereas one patient in group B had to discontinue therapy after the onset of a persistent cough.; Both treatments resulted in similar changes in systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure. In view of these results, it can be confirmed that sustained-release diltiazem at an oral dose of 300 mg/day was found to be effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of mild to moderate essential arterial hypertension in the elderly.",0,0

476,11050792,Management of heart failure: evidence versus practice. Does the current prescription provide optimal treatment for patients with heart failure?,,"Hobbs, F D","Heart failure is an increasingly common and costly chronic disease, with a rising prevalence of at least 2% in populations over 45 years of age, mortality rates as low as common solid cancers, and very high health care costs. Despite accumulating evidence supporting a range of effective, predominantly therapeutic, interventions, there remains a significant level of medical underperformance related to the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure. Until the early 1990s, treatment of heart failure was largely limited to symptomatic relief of patients with known heart failure from fluid overload. The advent of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors provided the first treatments to positively alter the prognosis of patients with the most common form of heart failure, established systolic dysfunction, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. Evidence has now extended these benefits to delay the progression of heart failure and reduce hospitalizations. Much of our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure comes from these studies. Recent data have highlighted the limited role of digoxin, the important benefits of beta-blockers and aldosterone blockers as adjuvants to ACE inhibition, and the new understanding of angiotensin II antagonists. Contrasting with these positive results, there is reliable data from Europe and North America showing significant underperformance of primary care physicians and clinicians in diagnosing and treating heart failure, with evidence of underuse and underdosing of evidence-based therapies. Limited qualitative data suggest that the reasons for this underperformance are complex and relate to lack of access to objective tests of ventricular function and undue concern about treatment risks and side effects. Heart failure represents a complex bundle of etiologies and risks that are not easy to identify correctly even in specialist circles. As there is now compelling evidence on how to modify and improve heart failure, explicit guidance is needed on which suspected patients should be referred to confirm the diagnosis and receive advice on appropriate treatment regimens, and which patients are primarily treated in primary care but can with improved access to objective non-invasive tests to improve diagnostic reliability and stratify patients for evidence-based therapies. Recent evidence suggests that primary care physicians in North America and Europe today underperform in the care of patients with heart failure, often due to factors beyond their immediate control.",0,0

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor has been shown to reduce these risks by approximately 20%. The development of angiotensin II receptor blockers offers a new, more specific and theoretically more complete pharmacological mode for inhibiting the adverse effects of angiotensin II.; Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction (VALIANT) is a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled study to compare the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment with valsartan, captopril and their combination in high-risk post-MI patients. The study has a three-arm design, with statistically equal consideration being given to comparisons of survival of captopril with the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan and the combination of captopril plus valsartan in comparison with a dose of captopril that has been proven to be effective. This 14,500 patient study is designed with a power of 86% to demonstrate a 15% reduction in mortality for both uses of valsartan compared to captopril. The study promotes optimal individualization of other established therapies for acute and chronic infarction, and the international patient population ensures good representation of multiple practice patterns.; VALIANT is a major international research project that will investigate the role of valsartan in the treatment of patients with MI associated with heart failure and/or left ventricular dysfunction.

The three treatments resulted in similar reductions in supine systolic blood pressure. There were no significant differences in the risk of cardiovascular events between patients receiving conventional therapy and those receiving newer therapies. All three treatments were well tolerated. The STOP-Hypertension-2 results thus add to the extensive literature demonstrating the benefits of blood pressure lowering in elderly hypertensive patients.

Furthermore, they conclude that the benefit of the treatment is due to blood pressure reduction per se rather than specific antihypertensive therapy. The results of the second Swedish study in elderly patients with hypertension (STOP-Hypertension-2) are consistent with these recommendations, since in this study angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists lowered blood pressure to the same extent as conventional therapy with beta-blockers and diuretics in elderly hypertensive patients, and the three treatments resulted in a similar reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events. In addition, an initial subgroup analysis of cardiovascular mortality showed that the three treatments appeared to be equally effective in diabetics.

In addition, studies on the antihypertensive efficacy of drugs can be negatively influenced by the fact that between 15% and 30% of the patients included do not have high blood pressure according to ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Therefore, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study was conducted to compare the effect of nifedipine-GITS (gastrointestinal therapeutic system) with enalapril.; After a 2-week placebo run-in period, 186 patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 mmHg were enrolled for an 8-week treatment period. They received 30–60 mg nifedipine GITS or 5–10 mg enalapril.

However, the increase in blood pressure 2 h before waking up was significantly more suppressed by nifedipine. In addition, this study highlighted the presence of ""white coat"" hypertension in a number of patients, particularly when clinical BP was used to identify hypertension. Of the patients who were identified as hypertensive by standardized blood pressure measurements prior to randomization, 53 (28.5%) were identified as non-hypertensive by 24-hour blood pressure monitoring.

ACE inhibitors can also cause isolated visceral angioedema, a rarely reported complication. This article describes 2 patients who experienced this complication. Both patients presented to a doctor with episodes of recurring abdominal symptoms that had occurred while taking ACE inhibitors for high blood pressure. Each patient had undergone surgical procedures for symptoms that persisted after surgery and were eventually relieved by stopping their ACE inhibitors. These cases draw attention to a potentially underestimated cause of abdominal pain in patients presenting to emergency departments.",0,0

There is no information on hypotension at the first dose after angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers in this type of patient. Comparison of first dose responses to low dose captopril and losartan in patients with acute myocardial infarction.; Single-blind, randomized, multicenter, prospective study. Patients (n=320) with confirmed acute myocardial infarction, aged >18 years, treated with direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, thrombolysis and/or heparin were randomized to receive a single dose of 6.25-12.5 mg captopril or 12.5- Losartan 25 mg within 24 hours of hospital admission. Baseline laboratory and clinical investigations were performed prior to study initiation. Blood pressure monitoring began on admission to the hospital and continued for at least 8 hours after medication (the second dose of captopril was administered at 8 hours). The maximum drop in blood pressure occurred approximately 1 hour after the first dose of captopril and 3.5 hours after the first dose of losartan. Patients in the captopril group had a significantly higher incidence of asymptomatic hypotension (38%) than patients treated with losartan (24%) (P<0.001). No difference in hypotension requiring a change in medication was observed.; A low dose of losartan is safe for initiating therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction within 24 hours of hospital admission.",0,0
489,11078175,Effect of indomethacin on blood pressure in elderly people with essential hypertension well controlled with amlodipine or enalapril.,,"Morgan, T O; Anderson, A; Bertram, D","Arthritis and hypertension are common comorbidities in the elderly with hypertension. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to relieve pain in arthritis sufferers, but a side effect is sodium retention and a resulting increase in blood pressure (BP). The effect of dihydropyridine calcium blockers is relatively independent of sodium intake, while the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can be attenuated by a high-sodium diet. This study compared the effects of indomethacin versus placebo in elderly patients with essential hypertension controlled with amlodipine or enalapril. Indomethacin 50 mg twice daily or placebo was administered for 3 weeks in a double-blind, crossover study in patients treated with amlodipine or enalapril. Response was assessed by ambulatory BP measurement. Indomethacin increased blood pressure and decreased heart rate in patients taking enalapril but had little effect in patients receiving amlodipine. The difference between the two groups caused by indomethacin was a 10.1/4.9 mm Hg increase in blood pressure and a 5.6 bpm decrease in heart rate in people taking enalapril. The addition of indomethacin to patients taking both drugs resulted in an increase in weight and a decrease in plasma renin. It is postulated that the effect is due to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, which causes sodium retention. In patients taking amlodipine, the fall in plasma renin improves the effect of sodium retention on blood pressure. In patients taking enalapril, plasma renin falls, but this does not translate into an effect due to the blocking of the converting enzyme. Thus, the full effect of sodium retention on blood pressure is expressed. In patients treated with indomethacin fewer patients may respond to ACE inhibitors. The main problem, however, is the patient taking intermittent indomethacin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which, when a person is treated with an ACE inhibitor, causes blood pressure to spiral out of control. In such patients, amlodipine appears to be the preferred choice over enalapril.",0,0

After a 3-week (week -9 to -6) salt ad libitum diet, those patients who had a sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) > or = 95 but < or = 115 mm Hg qualified for a 3-week Treatment (Weeks -6 to -3) Placebo run-in low-salt diet (50 to 80 mmol Na+/day). Then, high salt (200 to 250 mmol Na+/day) was added to the placebo treatment for 3 weeks (weeks -3 to 0). Those patients who demonstrated an increase in SDBP > or = 5 mm Hg from the low-salt to the high-salt diet were classified as salt sensitive and were randomized to a 4-week (weeks 0 to 4) double-blind treatment period with either isradipine 2.5 to 10 allocated mg twice daily, enalapril 2.5 to 20 mg twice daily or placebo. They then entered a 3-week (weeks 4 to 7) placebo washout period on a low-salt diet (50 to 80 mmol Na+/day). After week 7 and while the low-salt diet was continued, double-blind treatment of patients was resumed for an additional 4 weeks (weeks 7 to 11) and the study was terminated. Of 1,916 patients screened, 464 were randomized to the double-blind treatment phase and 397 completed the study. Both isradipine and enalapril reduced sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP) and SDBP to similar extents during the high-salt diet, while enalapril caused greater reductions in SSBP and SDBP than isradipine during the low-salt diet (11.3 +/- 1.2 / 7.7 +/- 0.7 mmHg v 7.7 +/- 0.9/4.8 +/- 0.6 mmHg, mean +/- SEM, P < 0.02). Within drugs, the effect of isradipine on blood pressure (BP) was greater during the high than the low salt diet (14.9 +/- 1.5 v 7.6 +/- 1.3 mm Hg for SSBP and 10.1 +/- 0.6 v 4.8 +/- 0.9 mm Hg for SDBP, P<0.001), but enalapril exerted a similar effect on both diets. Since salt restriction lowered both SSBP and SDBP, the lowest blood pressure was achieved with both drugs during the salt restriction phase.",0,0

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with enalapril improves acetylcholine (ACh)-dependent endothelial function in patients with NIDDM. This could be mediated by angiotensin II and the type 1 receptor, or could be due to inhibition of kininase II and a bradykinin-preserving effect. It is therefore relevant to determine whether a type 1 receptor antagonist improves endothelial function.; The impact of losartan (50 mg daily for four weeks) on endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilator function was determined in 9 NIDDM subjects using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover protocol. Blood flow in the forearm was measured using strain gauge plethysmography.; Losartan significantly decreased infused arm vascular resistance in response to three incremental doses of intrabrachial acetylcholine (p<0.05, ANOVA). The blood flow ratio in the forearm (flow in the infused to non-infused arm) was also increased (p<0.01). Responses to sodium nitroprusside and monomethylarginine were not significantly altered.; Administration of losartan at 50 mg per day improved endothelium-dependent dilatation of resistance vessels in patients with NIDDM. That is, blockade of angiotensin II type 1 receptors improves endothelial function in NIDDM. At least some of the similar beneficial effects of ACE inhibition are also likely mediated through the angiotensin II type 1 receptor pathway. The use of a type 1 receptor antagonist appears to be a reasonable alternative to an ACE inhibitor to maintain endothelial function in NIDDM subjects.",0,0

In both groups, patients with worse AMI (respectively 66% and 72%) and normal LV function (EF > or = 40% in ECHO) predominated in the study. Captopril therapy was started with a dose of 3.125 mg, then doses of 6.25 mg were given every 8 hours on the 1st and 2nd day, 12.5 mg on the 3rd day and 25 mg from the 4th day onwards . Exercise bike (ExT) tests were performed on each patient 14 days and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after AMI. The ExT started at 25 W of power and increased by 25 W at 2-minute intervals until fatigue or some other typical cause for termination of the test. In the captopril group, the ExT duration increased significantly compared to the baseline test (on day 14) after 3 (6.4 +/- 1.47 vs. 5.3 +/- 1.54 min; p < 0 .01), 6 (6.7 +/- 1.59 vs. 5.3 +). // 1.54 mins; p < 0.001) and 12 months (7.0 +/- 1.22 vs. 5.3 +/- 1.54 min; p < 0.001).

However, the differences in this time between the captopril and control groups at consecutive control levels were not significant. The final result of the test (positive, negative, equivocal) did not differ significantly in the two groups at successive examination levels. Captopril administered for a period of 1 year after AMI slightly improved physical work capacity (accelerated improvement) and had no effect on ischemia during the estimated cycle ergometer test. These results may depend on whether predominantly patients with normal LV function and internal myocardial infarction were enrolled in the study.",0,0
493,11081765,Renal effects of blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in heart failure.,,"Ruilope, L M; Barrios, V; Volpe, M","The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been actively involved in renal dysfunction since the early stages of heart failure (HF). Decreased sodium excretion capacity due to increased proximal tubular reabsorption and loss of renal functional reserve are the two major initial changes in renal function in which angiotensin II has been shown to act directly. Meanwhile, the octapeptide helps keep the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) within normal limits by vasoconstriction of the efferent arterioles. The administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARA) can therefore be associated with a functional decline in this parameter. Advanced age, higher baseline serum creatinine, hypertension, diabetes and a history of atrial fibrillation predict the onset of GFR impairment associated with blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Co-administration of beta-blockers may help protect kidney function and preliminary data indicate that the combination of ACEi and ARA is not associated with an increased risk of kidney disease. The good prognostic effects of aldosterone antagonists in heart failure do not appear to be related to the intrarenal effects of these compounds, except for the prevention of potassium loss and hypokalemia. Systematic therapeutic use of drugs with beneficial renal effects to treat arterial hypertension or myocardial ischemia can help delay or prevent the development of heart failure.",0,0
494,11090788,Comparison of the efficacy and side effects of combination therapy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (benazepril) with calcium antagonists (either nifedipine or amlodipine) versus high-dose calcium antagonist monotherapy in systemic hypertension.,,"Messerli, F H; Oparil, S; Feng, Z","The present 2 multicentre studies were designed to evaluate whether patients with essential hypertension would benefit equally from combination therapy with a calcium channel blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor as from a doubling of the calcium channel blocker dose. After a 2-week wash-out period and a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, a total of 1,390 patients were treated with either nifedipine 30 mg (Study 1) or amlodipine 5 mg (Study 2) once daily for 4 weeks. The 1,079 patients whose diastolic blood pressure remained between 95 and 115 mmHg were randomized to receive 8 weeks of double-blind therapy with amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg, nifedipine 30 mg, or nifedipine 60 mg (Study 1 ) and amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg, amlodipine 5 mg or amlodipine 10 mg (study 2). Both doses of calcium channel blocker/ACE inhibitor combination therapy reduced diastolic pressure as much as the high dose and significantly better than the lower dose of calcium channel blocker monotherapy (with either nifedipine or amlodipine). However, 15% of patients in the high-dose nifedipine monotherapy group and 24% in the high-dose amlodipine monotherapy group experienced some form of edema. In contrast, the incidence of edema was similar in patients treated with both combination therapy and low-dose calcium channel blockers. Thus, combination therapy with a calcium channel blocker and an ACE inhibitor provides blood pressure control equivalent to high-dose calcium channel blocker monotherapy, but with significantly fewer dose-dependent side effects such as vasodilatory edema. inc",0,0

Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, including verapamil, reduce proteinuria to a similar extent as the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), including trandolapril, but to a greater extent than other antihypertensives. Angiotensin (Ang) II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil, demonstrate potent and long-lasting preventive effects against the progression of kidney damage. The aim of the present study is to assess whether verapamil, trandolapril and candesartan cilexetil affect proteinuria and urinary podocytes in patients with IgA nephropathy. 32 normotensive patients aged 18 to 54 years with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy, non-nephrotic proteinuria (1 to 3 g/day) and normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min) were studied. Twenty patients with diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (non-IgA PGN) and 20 healthy controls were also included in this study. Urinary podocyte counts were significantly higher in patients with advanced IgA nephropathy (n=16) than in patients with mild-stage disease (n=16) (p<0.01) or in patients with non-IgA PGN (p<0.01). Podocytes were not detected in the urine of healthy controls. The 32 patients with IgA nephropathy were randomized into four treatment groups: those treated with verapamil (120 mg/day, n=8); those treated with trandolapril (2 mg/day, n=8); those treated with candesartan cilexetil (8 mg/day, n=8) and those receiving placebo (n=8). The treatment was continued for 3 months. The antiproteinuric response in the trandolapril group was similar to that in the candesartan cilexetil group (-38 vs. -40%). The effect of trandolapril or candesartan cilexetil was greater than that of verapamil (p<0.01). The reduction from baseline in urinary podocyte count was significantly greater in patients treated with trandolapril or candesartan cilexetil than in patients treated with verapamil (p<0.01). However, there was no difference between the patients treated with trandolapril and those treated with candesartan cilexetil. Proteinuria and urinary podocytes were not affected in the placebo group.

We prospectively evaluated changes in blood pressure (BP), protein excretion, and renal function after administration of the long-acting ACE inhibitor ramipril monotherapy for 6 months in 14 moderately hypertensive children aged 5 to 18 years with various nephropathies. Four patients initially had a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). BP was assessed by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. After 2 weeks of treatment with oral ramipril (1.5 mg/m2 once daily), mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressures fell by more than 5 mmHg in nine patients. The dose was doubled in eight patients. At the end of the study, systolic blood pressure was 9 and diastolic blood pressure was below the 95th percentile in 13 patients. The initially reduced nocturnal depression increased significantly. Of 11 patients with increased albumin clearance (median 1.3 g/g creatinine), 6 responded to ramipril with a median reduction of 78% (range 24-83%), while 5 had an increase in albuminuria (median +19%). GFR was well preserved and no other adverse effects of the drug were noted. The study shows that ramipril is an effective antihypertensive agent in children with renal hypertension. It is well tolerated, even in the case of mild renal insufficiency.

Hypertension has been shown to increase the risk of not only cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality, but also cognitive impairment and dementia. Although diastolic blood pressure is considered an important risk factor, it is now clear that isolated systolic hypertension and increased pulse pressure also play an important role in the development of cerebral complications. Therefore, the treatment of these diseases urgently needs to become a widespread tool of prevention. All randomized placebo-controlled trials conducted over the last 30 years have shown a reduction in fatal and/or non-fatal stroke. In recent studies of isolated systolic hypertension in elderly patients, the benefit was even greater due to the higher risk in these populations. The new classes of drugs, particularly calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, have proven to be as effective as the originally used diuretics and beta-blockers. Active treatment in the Syst-Eur study based on nitrendipine as a first step, possibly in conjunction with enalapril and/or hydrochlorothiazide, not only reduced stroke and cardiovascular complications but also the incidence of dementia including Alzheimer's disease. This important finding needs to be confirmed by further studies specifically focused on the prevention of dementia. In addition, the importance of pulse pressure as a risk factor underscores the need for new drugs that could increase aortic compliance and decrease systolic blood pressure without greatly decreasing diastolic pressure. Improving hypertension management offers new opportunities to reduce age-related diseases in the elderly and promote healthy aging.",0,0

Currently, 2 classes of drugs act to block the RAAS, albeit through different mechanisms: angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs). The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the ARB irbesartan and the ACE inhibitor enalapril in patients aged > or = 65 years with mild to moderate hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP], 95 to 110 mm Hg ).; Elderly (> or = 65 years) patients were recruited from 26 Canadian study centers for a randomized, double-blind, 8-week clinical study. Exclusion criteria included DBP sitting > 110 mm Hg or sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 200 mm Hg, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery, stroke, or transient ischemic attack within 6 months of randomization, and other pre-existing or present serious medical or mental illness.

Reductions in baseline blood pressure measurements at nadir (24 +/- 3 hours after the last drug dose) were assessed for seated DBP and seated SBP. Comparative tolerability with study drugs was also assessed.; Intent-to-treat analysis showed similar reductions at week 8 in both DBP and SBP for both groups. For the primary efficacy analysis of seated DBP, there was a mean reduction of 9.6 mm Hg and 9.8 mm Hg from baseline for the irbesartan and enalapril groups, respectively (p=0.93). The mean reduction from baseline in sitting SBP was 10.1 mm Hg and 11.6 mm Hg for the irbesartan and enalapril groups, respectively (p=0.54). Normalization rates (seated DBP < 90 mm Hg) at week 8 did not differ between groups (52.9% in the irbesartan group and 54.9% in the enalapril group; P=0.81). There was no statistical difference between the two groups with regard to serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events. Irbesartan was associated with a significantly lower incidence of cough than enalapril (4.3% vs. 15.5%; p=0.046); Irbesartan is an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive drug for elderly patients with mild to moderate hypertension.

However, the effect of beta-blockers added to high-dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has not been reported.; To study the effect of atenolol, a hydrophilic selective beta1-adrenergic antagonist, in addition to enalapril 40 mg/day in patients with advanced left ventricular dysfunction in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.; One hundred and nineteen patients with heart failure class II or III, left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 25% and treated with enalapril 40 mg daily received an initial challenge dose of 12.5 mg atenolol. One hundred patients (54 with idiopathic, 28 with ischemic, 18 with other dilated cardiomyopathy) tolerated the challenge and were randomized to receive atenolol (maintenance dose 89 +/- 11 mg/day, range 50-100 mg/day) or placebo. The primary endpoint was composite worsening of heart failure or death within 2 years; the secondary endpoint was hospitalization for cardiac events.; After 395 +/- 266 days, an interim analysis revealed a significant difference between the atenolol and placebo groups (log-rank P<0.01) and the study was completed. 27 patients had developed worsening heart failure (8 in the atenolol group vs. 19 in the placebo group) and 13 patients had died (5 in the atenolol group vs. 8 in the placebo group). There were a total of 23 hospital admissions for cardiac events (6 in the atenolol group vs. 21 in the placebo group, P=0.07); 17 hospital admissions were due to worsening heart failure (5 in the atenolol group, 12 in the placebo group, P=0.05) and 10 due to arrhythmias (1 in the atenolol group vs. 9 in the placebo group, P<0.01); The data suggest that beta-blockers may provide significant benefits in patients with advanced left ventricular dysfunction, over and above those already achieved with high-dose enalapril treatment.",0,0

The ATLAS study group.,,"Sculpher, M J; Poole, L; Cleland, J; Drummond, M; Armstrong, P W; Horowitz, J D; Massie, B M; Poole-Wilson, P A; Ryden, L","cost-benefit analysis of high and low doses of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril in the treatment of chronic heart failure.; A cost-benefit analysis using data from a randomized controlled trial, ATLAS, in which 3164 patients with chronic heart failure received a high-dose (target daily dose 32.5-35 mg) or a low-dose strategy (target daily dose 2.5-5, 0) were allocated mg) of lisinopril. The differential costs were based on the resource use data collected in the study, calculated using UK unit costs. Cost-effectiveness analysis related different costs to different years of life during a 4-year study follow-up.; The mean total number of inpatient days per patient was 18.5 in the high-dose group and 22.5 in the low-dose group. Over the entire study period, the mean (SD) daily dose of lisinopril in the high dose group was 22.5 mg (15.7 mg) compared to 3.2 mg (2.5 mg) in the low dose group. The average cost difference per patient was £397 lower in the high dose group [95% CI (high-dose-low-dose) – £1263 to £436]. The mean years of life per patient were 0.085 years higher in the high dose group [95% CI (high dose-low dose) -0.0074 to 0.1706). Based on median costs and life years, high-dose therapy dominates over low-dose (less expensive and more effective). Taking into account the uncertainty in mean costs and life years, the probability that high-dose therapy is less expensive than low-dose therapy was 82%. If a decision maker is willing to pay at least £3600 per life year gained, there was a 92% chance that a high dose would be cheaper.; The ATLAS study showed that treating heart failure with high-dose lisinopril is likely to be more cost-effective than low-dose therapy.",1,0
512,11115082,ACEI/ATRA therapy reduces proteinuria by improving glomerular permselectivity in IgA nephritis.,,"Woo, K T; Lau, Y K; Wong, K S; Chiang, G S","It has been postulated that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor antagonist (ACEI/ATRA) may reduce proteinuria in patients with glomerulonephritis through its action on the glomerular basement membrane. We therefore examined the relationship between the response of patients with IgA nephritis (IgAN) to ACEI/ATRA therapy by reducing proteinuria and its effect on the selectivity index (SI) in these patients.; Forty-one patients with biopsy-proven IgAN participated in a control study, 21 in the treatment group and 20 in the control group. Inclusion criteria included proteinuria of 1 g or more and/or impaired renal function. Patients in the treatment group received ACEI/ATRA or both with three monthly dose increases. In the control group, the high blood pressure was treated with atenolol, hydrallazine or methyldopa. The following tests were performed at three-month intervals: serum creatinine, total urine protein, SI, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and low molecular weight (LMW) proteinuria; After a median duration of therapy of 13 +/- 5 months, there was no significant change in serum creatinine, proteinuria, or SI in the treatment group, but in the control group, serum creatinine deteriorated from 1.8 +/- 0.8 to 2.3 +/- 1.1 mg/dL (P<0.05). Of the 21 patients in the treatment group, 10 responded to ACEI/ATRA therapy as determined by a 30% decrease in proteinuria (responders) and the other 11 did not respond (non-responders). Among responders, SI improved from a mean of 0.26 +/- 0.07 to 0.18 +/- 0.07 (P < 0.001), indicating a tendency toward selective proteinuria. This was with an improvement in serum creatinine from a mean of 1.7 +/- 0.6 to 1.5 +/- 0.6 mg/dL (P < 0.02) and a decrease in proteinuria by a mean of 2.3 +/- 1.1 linked to 0.7 +/- 0.5 g/day (P < 0.001). After treatment, proteinuria was significantly lower in the treatment group (1.8 +/- 1.6 g/day) than in the control group (2.9 +/- 1.8 g/day, P<0.05). Post-treatment SI in the responder group (0.18 +/- 0.07) was better than that in the non-responder group (0.33 +/- 0.11, P<0.002). Eight of 21 patients in the treatment group with documented renal impairment had improved renal function compared to two patients in the control group (chi2=4.4, P<0.05). Of the eight patients in the treatment group who improved their kidney function, three normalized their kidney function compared to one in the control group.; Our data suggest that ACEI/ATRA therapy may be beneficial in patients with IgAN-impaired renal function and nonselective proteinuria, as these patients may respond to therapy with an improvement in protein selectivity, a decrease in proteinuria, and an improvement in renal function . ACEI/ATRA therapy likely modifies the pore size distribution by reducing the radius of large nonselective pores, causing the shunt pathway to become less pronounced, resulting in less leakage of protein into the urine.",0,0
513,11115412,"Losartan, an angiotensin type I receptor antagonist, improves vascular endothelial function in type II diabetes.",,"Cheetham, C; O'Driscoll, G; Stanton, K; Taylor, R; Green, D","We have previously shown that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with enalapril and angiotensin II blockade with losartan improve acetylcholine-dependent endothelial function in resistance vessels of patients with type II diabetes. It was therefore of interest to investigate the effect of losartan on vascular function in this group. The impact of losartan (50 mg daily for 4 weeks) on endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilator function was determined in 12 patients with type II diabetes using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover protocol. Conductor vessel endothelial function was assessed using high-resolution ultrasound and brachial artery response to reactive hyperemia (flow-mediated dilatation; FMD); Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) was used as a non-endothelial dependent dilator. Losartan administration significantly increased the FMD response from 5.2 +/- 0.7% (mean +/- SEM) to 7.4 +/- 0.6% of vessel diameter (p < 0.05; paired t -Test). There was no effect of losartan on endothelium-independent responses to GTN (17.8 +/- 1.8% to 17.6 +/- 1.2%). Consistent with our previous findings on resistance vessels, daily administration of losartan 50 mg improves NO-mediated dilatation in the conduction vessels of individuals with type II diabetes. Combined with the evidence that both ACE inhibition and angiotensin II blockade improve resistance vascular function in this group, it is likely that at least part of the beneficial effect is mediated through the angiotensin II/type I receptor pathway . A type I receptor antagonist appears to be a reasonable alternative to an ACE inhibitor to maintain vascular endothelial function in patients with type II diabetes.",0,0

In Study 1, 8 male volunteers with normal blood pressure received a single oral dose of enalapril (5 mg) or nitrendipine (10 mg) in a crossover fashion. Exhaled air was collected at baseline, 2, 4 and 8 hours after drug administration. In Study 2, 10 normotensive subjects (6 males and 4 females) and 10 hypertensive subjects (6 males and 4 females) received a single oral dose of enalapril (5 mg). Exhaled air was collected at baseline, 2 and 4 hours after drug administration. In Study 1, enalapril significantly increased the rate of NO release from the lungs in normotensive subjects (36.9 +/- 5.1 pmol/s at baseline versus 58.3 +/- 7.3 pmol/s at 4 hours, P< 0.01). Nitrendipine did not alter the NO release rate. In Study 2, enalapril significantly increased the release of NO from the lungs in subjects with normal blood pressure (40.4 +/- 6.0 pmol/s at baseline versus 70.3 +/- 11.4 pmol/s at 4 hours, P < 0.01), but not in hypertensive subjects. ACE inhibition increased NO production from the lungs in people with normal blood pressure but not in those with hypertension. Reduction in angiotensin II production and/or accumulation of bradykinin in lung tissue may be responsible for increased NO production in components of the lung such as pulmonary vascular endothelium, bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages, nasopharyngeal cells and neurons. However, the effects of ACE inhibition on pulmonary NO production differ between hypertensive and normotensive patients.",0,0

A total of 215 cases of hepatotoxicity reported using a structured reporting form were assessed by 3 independent experts. Due to the use of multiple drugs, 228 reviews were generated. Probability of diagnosis was rated as definitive, probable, possible, unlikely, or excluded and assessed for agreement using a weighted kappa statistical test. Absolute agreement between the two scales was observed in 42 cases (18%, weighted kappa 0.28) with a deviation of 1 level in 108 cases (47%) and 2 levels in 70 cases (31%). The best correlation between the 2 scales was obtained for drug-induced liver injury with a proposed immunoallergic mechanism: disagreement was 1 grade or less in 72% of cases (34 out of 48), compared with 60% of cases (85 out of 141) in which a putative idiosyncratic metabolic mechanism was involved. The lowest agreement (6%) was observed in cases with evidence of cholestasis. No match was found for fulminant hepatitis or death.

Attenuation of LV dilation has been proposed as an important mechanism.; Data from 845 patients with three months of echocardiographic follow-up after MI were combined from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The criteria for these studies included: 1) thrombolytic therapy; 2) ACE inhibition within 6 to 9 hours; and 3) assessment of LV dilation as the primary goal; The ACE inhibitor was started 3.2 +/- 1.7 h after the patients' first (mainly 85%) anterior myocardial infarction. At three months, LV dilatation was not significantly attenuated by very early treatment with an ACE inhibitor. The diastolic volume index was around 0.5 mL/m2 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.5 to 2.5, p=0.61) and the systolic volume index was around 0.5 mL/m2 (95% CI -1.0 to 1.9, p = 0.5 ml/m2) attenuated 0.50).

It is a highly lipophilic drug and as such has a slower onset of action and longer duration of action than a number of other calcium antagonists. Preclinical evidence suggests that lercanidipine has anti-atherogenic potential and may also protect against end-organ damage. In well-controlled clinical studies, once-daily dosing with lercanidipine 10 or 20 mg was effective in reducing blood pressure (BP) compared to placebo in patients with mild to moderate hypertension without affecting heart rate. The response rate (percentage of patients with diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg or decreased by > or = 10 mm Hg from baseline) ranged from 50 to 66% with lercanidipine 10 mg/day and up to 86% with lercanidipine 20 mg/day. Day. The drug had a long duration of action: clinical measurements of diastolic blood pressure in one study showed a trough/peak ratio of >0.8 for both lercanidipine doses. Comparative studies, published either in full or in summary, found that lercanidipine 10 mg once daily for > or = 4 weeks was at least as effective as atenolol 50 mg once daily, candesartan cilexetil 16 mg/day, captopril 25 mg twice daily, enalapril 20 mg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once daily, irbesartan 150 mg/day and slow-release nifedipine 20 mg twice daily in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In addition, lercanidipine 20 mg/day was as effective as amlodipine 10 mg/day. Lercanidipine is effective in the treatment of elderly patients (aged 60 to 85 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension and in patients with isolated systolic hypertension. In addition, monotherapy with lercanidipine 20 or 40 mg/day has been shown to be effective in patients with severe hypertension, and adjunctive therapy has helped control blood pressure in a large proportion of patients with severe hypertension who are inadequately responded to beta-blockers, diuretics, or ACE inhibitors responded. Unpublished data indicate that the drug lowers blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (non-insulin dependent) without affecting glucose homeostasis. Lercanidipine was well tolerated in clinical trials, with most of the treatment-emergent adverse reactions characteristic of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, namely headache, flushing, dizziness and ankle oedema; Lercanidipine is an effective and well-tolerated once-daily antihypertensive drug in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In addition, the drug can lower blood pressure when used as monotherapy in patients with severe hypertension or as add-on therapy in patients with resistant hypertension. Importantly, lercanidipine appears to be at least as effective and well tolerated as other commonly used antihypertensive drugs. The drug therefore represents a useful therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with hypertension and will be particularly useful in patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to antihypertensive agents from other drug classes.",0,0

Compared with patients given diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or clonidine (n=15,044), those given calcium channel blockers (n=12,699) had a significantly higher risk of acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio 1.26 [95% CI 1.11-1.43], p=0.0003), heart failure (1.25 [1.07-1.46], p=0.005), and major cardiovascular events (1.10 [1.02-1.18], p=0.018). Treatment differences were within the random game for outcomes of stroke (0.90 [0.80-1.02], p=0.10) and all-cause mortality (1.03 [0.94-1.13], p=0, 54); In randomized controlled trials, the large available database suggests that calcium channel blockers are inferior to other types of antihypertensive drugs as first-line drugs in reducing the risk of several serious complications of hypertension. Based on these data, the longer-acting calcium channel blockers cannot be recommended as first-line treatment for hypertension.",0,0

Collaboration of study participants on antihypertensive treatment.",,"Neal, B; MacMahon, S; Chapman, N","This program of reviews of randomized trials was established to investigate the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and other antihypertensive drugs on mortality and major cardiovascular morbidity in multiple patient populations. We provided separate reviews of studies comparing active treatment regimens to placebo, studies comparing more intensive and less intensive antihypertensive strategies, and studies comparing treatment regimens based on different drug classes.; The hypotheses to be examined, the studies to be included, and the results to be examined were all selected before the results of a participating study were known. Individual participant data or tabulated group data were provided from each study and combined by standard statistical techniques.; The review of placebo-controlled studies on ACE inhibitors (four studies, 12,124 patients, mostly with coronary artery disease) showed a reduction in stroke (30% [95% CI 15-43]), coronary artery disease (20% [11-28] ) and major cardiovascular events (21% [14-27]). The review of placebo-controlled studies with calcium channel blockers (two studies, 5520 patients, mainly with hypertension) showed a reduction in stroke (39% [15-56]) and major cardiovascular events (28% [13-41]). The overview of studies that compared antihypertensive strategies of different intensities (three studies, 20,408 patients with hypertension) showed reduced risks of stroke (20% [2–35]), coronary artery disease (19% [2–33]) and severe cardiovascular events (15% [4-24]) with more intensive therapy. In reviews comparing different antihypertensive regimens (eight studies, 37,872 patients with hypertension), several differences in causal-specific effects were seen between calcium channel blocker-based therapy and other regimens, but each was of borderline significance.; Reviews of placebo-controlled studies provide strong evidence for the benefit of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists. There is weaker evidence for differences between treatment regimens of different intensities and for differences between treatment regimens based on different drug classes. Data from ongoing trials of antihypertensive drugs will greatly expand the available evidence of actual differences that may exist between regimens.",1,0
527,11130772,Association between blood pressure reduction during antihypertensive treatment and sleep apnea activity.,,"Grote, L; Wutkewicz, K; Knaack, L; Ploch, T; Hedner, J; Peter, J H","This study examined whether drug therapy-induced reductions in nocturnal blood pressure (BP) were associated with decreased sleep apnea activity. Two polysomnographies from 54 hospitalized male patients with hypertensive obstructive sleep apnea were analyzed in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril (C), 2.5 mg once daily, or placebo (P). Blood pressure was measured using an intra-arterial catheter. Compared to P, C reduced mean arterial blood pressure during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) (-8.3 +/- 10.7 mm Hg, P = 0.05) and in REM sleep (-8.6 +/- 10.1mmHg, P=0.02). ). Respiratory Disorder Index (-8.6 +/- 3.2 events/h sleep (n/h), P=0.01) and Apnea Index (AI) (-6.6 +/- 3.0 n/h, P = 0.04) during NREM sleep were reduced by C and to a lesser extent P (-5.9 +/- 3.2 n/h, P = 0.07 and -5.0 +/- 3, respectively, 6n/h, P=0.18). The effect on AI and hypopnea index (HI) during REM sleep was not significant for C (-5.9 +/- 3.4 and 0.1 +/- 2.0, NS, respectively) and P (- 2.6 +/- 3.9 and 1.6 +/- 2.0 or NS). There was a significant linear correlation between change in systolic REM-BP and change in REM-AI (r=0.28, P=0.04); mean BP change was negatively correlated with change in HI (-0.28, P=0.04). During NREM sleep, there was no significant correlation between changes in blood pressure and treatment effects on sleep apnea activity. Blood pressure reduction after short-term antihypertensive treatment had no effect on sleep-disordered breathing during NREM sleep. Reduced blood pressure was associated with a weak reduction in AI and a slight increase in HI during REM sleep. It appears that elevated blood pressure contributes only marginally to the severity of sleep apnea in hypertensive patients with obstructive sleep apnea.",0,0
528,11131271,"Comparison of the long-term therapeutic effect of an ACE inhibitor, temocapril, with that of a diuretic on microalbuminuria in nondiabetic essential hypertension.",,"Shionoiri, H; Kosaka, T; Kita, E; Takizawa, T; Takasaki, I","Many researchers have reported that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have antiproteinuric effects and delay the progression of renal dysfunction in diabetics. On the other hand, these effects of ACE inhibitors in patients with essential hypertension are not well established. This study was conducted to prospectively investigate whether an ACE inhibitor, temocapril, might alter the rate of urinary microalbumin (UAE) excretion in hypertensive outpatients with no evidence of renal dysfunction. To compare the long-term effect of temocapril versus that of a diuretic on UAE, hypertensive patients treated with a diuretic (trichlormethiazide) were included in a prospective study if they had normal serum creatinine levels and none during a 3-month screening period had obvious proteinuria. A microalbumin-to-urine creatinine ratio in urine (mg albumin/mmol Cr) was used to estimate UAE. Patients visited the hospital monthly to determine blood pressure (BP) and UAE. After baseline observation during treatment with the diuretic, subjects were randomly divided into two groups. In group A, the diuretic was switched to temocapril, 2 to 4 mg once daily for 12 months. In Group B, subjects received the diuretic for an additional 12 months. Seventy-six outpatients (41 males and 35 females; mean age 59.0 +/- 1.4 years) with essential hypertension participated in the study. The effects of temocapril on blood pressure appeared to be clinically similar to those of trichlormethiazide, but the use of temocapril significantly reduced AE. In group A (n = 37), the UAE decreased significantly (p < 0.01) from the baseline value of 4.19 +/- 0.37 mg albumin/mmol Cr to 2.47 +/- 0.29 and 2.68 +/- 0.28 mg albumin/mmol Cr at in the 6th or 12th month of temocapril therapy. In contrast, UAE in group B (n=39) were unchanged (baseline 4.16 +/- 0.63 mg albumin/mmol Cr; 6 months 4.92 +/- 0.72; 12 months 4.71+ /- 0.74). These results indicate that long-term therapy with temocapril may be better at reducing AE than diuretic therapy in patients with essential hypertension who have no evidence of renal dysfunction.",0,0
529,11131272,Blood pressure control in Japanese hypertensive patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus.,,"Katayama, S; Inaba, M; Morita, T; Awata, T; Shimamoto, K; Kikkawa, R","Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure are considered to be particularly at risk for cardiovascular diseases. Recent guidelines for treating hypertension, such as the JNC VI and WHO/ISH guidelines, recommend that antihypertensive drugs should be controlled as low as 130/85 mmHg and blood pressure reduced to less than 130/85 mmHg. Our study aimed to clarify how well and to what extent blood pressure (BP) was controlled in Japanese hypertensive patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. We surveyed two hundred physicians randomly selected from members of the Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) (n=98) and Japanese Diabetes Society (JDS) (n=102) and obtained information on five recent cases of hypertension with (total n=954) and their 2 most recent cases of hypertension without diabetes (total n=371). The achieved blood pressure was below 140/90 mmHg in 40.5% of the non-diabetic and 38.3% of the diabetic hypertensive patients. The percentage of patients whose blood pressure was below 130/85 mmHg was 10.8% for non-diabetics and 11.4% for diabetics. The average number of antihypertensive drugs used was 1.46 in non-diabetics and 1.52 in diabetics. Physicians prescribed more ACE inhibitors and alpha-blockers to diabetics than to non-diabetics, despite the fact that more than 70% of patients were given Ca-antagonists, whether or not they had diabetes. In contrast, fewer beta-blockers and diuretics were administered to diabetics. These results suggest that although Japanese physicians consider the effects of antihypertensive agents on metabolism and renal function when treating diabetic hypertensive patients, the blood pressure achieved is inadequate in both hypertensive patients with and without diabetes, with only one of ten patients has a blood pressure less than 130/85 mmHg even in diabetics. Therefore, improved blood pressure control is needed to treat high-risk groups such as patients with diabetes mellitus.",0,0

After the 4-week drug-free period, 17 patients were randomly divided into two groups. The first group (Group 1: n = 8) received lisinopril 10-20 mg daily for 8 weeks, followed by nitrendipine 5-10 mg daily for an additional 8 weeks. The second group (Group 2: n = 9) received nitrendipine 5-10 mg daily for 8 weeks, followed by lisinopril 10-20 mg daily for an additional 8 weeks. Mean blood pressure (MBP) decreased significantly in both groups in a similar manner. The UAE decreased significantly after 8 weeks of treatment with lisinopril in group 1 and after 8 weeks of subsequent treatment with lisinopril in group 2. On the other hand, the UAE were not changed by treatment with nitrendipine. Changes in UAE significantly correlated with changes in MBP after 8 weeks of nitrendipine treatment but not after 8 weeks of lisinopril treatment. No significant changes in creatinine clearance, urinary sodium excretion or urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide were observed in either treatment group. These results suggest that lisinopril, not nitrendipine, reduces UAE in patients with essential hypertension with microalbuminuria independent of its potent antihypertensive properties.",0,0

535,11139094,Update on recent clinical trials in congestive heart failure.,,"Betkowski, A S; Hauptman, P J","The understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure has improved over the past decade, leading to new therapeutic advances. There is convincing data that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and adrenergic blockade are the most important therapies and have the ability to improve survival and reduce morbidity. Higher doses of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers appear to provide additional benefits. The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone offers an additional survival benefit in severe heart failure when added to standard triple therapy. Angiotensin receptor blockers have not been shown to be superior to ACE inhibitors, and their role in the management of heart failure warrants further investigation. No study data supports the use of inotropic agents or calcium channel blockers in heart failure. A number of new therapeutics, including vasopressin antagonists and tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor antibodies, are in Phase II and III clinical trials. If they prove useful, they could offer new treatment options for heart failure patients. Nonetheless, the current challenge is to increase the use of proven therapies, namely ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, to improve outcomes in the rapidly growing population of congestive heart failure patients.",0,0

After 3 years of continuous treatment, he presented with jaundice and progressive liver failure that persisted despite drug discontinuation. The patient was not taking any other medication. All known causes of acute liver failure could be ruled out, suggesting drug-induced liver injury after long-term treatment with enalapril. Analysis of liver biopsies revealed a pathomorphologic pattern comparable to that seen in severe halothane hepatitis. Serological studies, including T-cell stimulation with enalapril and a wide range of autoimmunity tests, including autoantibodies to calreticulin, the major Ca2+- and Zn2+-binding protein of the endoplasmic reticulum thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of halothane hepatitis. were negative. Thus, the mechanism of enalapril-induced liver damage remains unclear. Liver failure progressed and eventually led to orthotopic liver transplantation. To our knowledge, this is the longest duration of chronic treatment with an ACE inhibitor before liver failure. In addition, the liver failure progressed despite discontinuation of the drug. From this it is concluded that liver failure can also be induced after long-term treatment with an ACE inhibitor. Therefore, regular monitoring of liver enzymes should be considered.",0,0

Hypersensitivity or immune-mediated reactions, while less common, tend to be proportionately more severe. There is convincing evidence that the immune system is involved in the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity reactions. Our understanding of how the immune system recognizes drugs is based on the hapten hypothesis; The onset of hypersensitivity involves drug bioactivation, covalent binding to proteins, followed by uptake, antigen processing, and T-cell proliferation. Central to this hypothesis is the critical role of drug metabolism, with the balance between metabolic bioactivation and detoxification being an important component of individual susceptibility. The purpose of this review article is to classify drug hypersensitivity reactions in terms of their clinical presentation and also to consider recent advances in our understanding of the chemical, biochemical and particularly cellular immunological mechanisms of hypersensitivity. The following topics will be reviewed: (i) drug disposition and cellular metabolism; (ii) mechanisms of antigen processing and presentation; (iii) the role of cytokines and costimulatory molecules in inducing and maintaining a polarized immune response; and (iv) the application of the hapten hypothesis, the hazard hypothesis and the serial trigger model to drug hypersensitivity.

The neurohormonal effects may be important in this regard, as may early hemodynamic unloading induced by these drugs. The primary objective was to assess the effect of trandolapril on plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide. A secondary objective was to evaluate the effects of trandolapril on selected neurohormones, vasoactive peptides and enzymes that may be important in the development of left ventricular remodeling and heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. A total of 119 patients with an acute myocardial infarction and a wall motion index < or = 1.2 (16-segment echocardiographic model) were randomized to double-blind treatment with trandolapril or placebo within 3 to 7 days of onset of infarction. The blind treatment was discontinued 21 days after the index infarction. Venous blood samples were collected at rest, prior to randomization, and on the day following treatment termination. At the end of the study, there were no differences in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide between the two treatment groups. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity was suppressed and plasma renin activity was higher in the trandolapril group. No differences in plasma levels of N-terminal proatrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, norepinephrine, adrenaline, vasopressin, large endothelin-1 and neuropeptide Y were found between the two treatment groups. There were positive correlations between several markers of neurohormonal activation at baseline and variables expressing left ventricular dysfunction and clinical heart failure. Neurohormonal activation is related to left ventricular dysfunction. The effects of 2-3 weeks of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on neurohormonal activation do not predict the long-term beneficial effects already demonstrated after myocardial infarction. Therefore, early modulation of circulating neurohormone levels may not be a major mechanism for the effectiveness of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in these patients. Selected plasma hormone markers can still be used to identify patients who may benefit most from treatment.",0,0

We hypothesized that both the ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (AT(1)-A) increase nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability by reducing oxidative stress in of the vessel wall, possibly by increasing EC-SOD activity.; Thirty-five patients with CHD were randomized to ACEI (ramipril 10 mg/d) or AT(1)-A (losartan 100 mg/d) for 4 weeks. Radial artery FDD was measured by high-resolution ultrasound before and after intra-arterial administration of N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) to inhibit NO synthase and before and after intra-arterial administration of vitamin C to determine the level of FDD inhibition determined by free oxygen radicals. EC-SOD activity was determined after release from the endothelium by bolus heparin injection. FDD was improved after ramipril and losartan (each group P<0.01), and in particular the proportion of FDD mediated by NO, i.e. inhibited by L-NMMA, was increased by >75% (each group P<0 ,01). Vitamin C initially improved FDD, an effect lost after ramipril or losartan. After therapy, EC-SOD activity was increased by > 200% in both groups (ACEI, 14.4 +/- 1.1 versus 3.8 +/- 0.9 and AT(1)-A, 13, 5 +/- 1.0 versus 3.9 +/- 0.9 U, mL(-1), min(-1), P<0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS - Four weeks of therapy with ramipril or losartan improves endothelial function in patients with CHD to a similar extent by increasing NO bioavailability.

Given the close correlation between morphologic changes and prognosis, we wanted to investigate whether the benefit of both beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors might lie in a similar protective effect on infarct size or ventricular volume.; In a randomized, double-blind comparison of early treatment with captopril or atenolol in 121 patients with acute anterior MI, both drugs demonstrated similar reductions in mean blood pressure. However, only patients treated with atenolol showed a significant early decrease in heart rate. Infarct size, as determined from the perfusion defect on single photon emission imaging at rest, was larger in captopril-treated patients than in atenolol-treated patients: 29.8 +/- 12% versus 20.8 +/- 12% (P: < 0.01) by polar map and 28.3 +/- 13% versus 20.0 +/- 13% (P: < 0.01) by tomography. The changes in ventricular end-diastolic volume, assessed by echocardiography, from baseline to 1 week and to 3 months were as follows: 58 +/- 14 versus 64 +/- 19 (p < 0.05) and 65 +/- 21 mL/ m(2) (P<0.05) with captopril and 58+/-18 versus 64+/-18 (P<0.05) and 69+/-30 ml/m(2) (P<0, 05). , with atenolol.

However, the relationship between LV wall stress and LV remodeling is incompletely defined.; We prospectively investigated the relationship between regional wall stress and LV remodeling by applying finite element analysis to LV end-systolic models from patients enrolled in the HEART (Healing and Early Afterload Reducing Therapy) study. Individual LV models were constructed from orthogonal apical echocardiographic views acquired on day 14 after anteroseptal MI in 64 patients. Of these, 31 patients received low dose ramipril (0.625 mg) and 33 patients received full dose ramipril (10 mg). LV wall stress was calculated using the finite element method and correlated to the change in LV volume from day 14 to day 90 after MI; In all patients, increases in apical regional wall tension were associated with changes in LV volume (P trend = 0.015). The relationship between apical regional wall tension and change in LV volume was strongest in the low-dose ramipril group (r = 0.53, p = 0.002) and remained significant after adjustment for end-diastolic volume, infarct size, ejection fraction, and however, systolic blood pressure was reduced in the full-dose ramipril group; Apical regional wall stress is an independent predictor of subsequent LV remodeling after MI. The relationship between increased apical wall tension and LV dilatation appears to be attenuated by full-dose inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme.",0,0
547,11174888,Treatment of advanced heart failure.,,"Jessup, M; Brozena, S","The incidence of chronic heart failure has increased, with a corresponding increase in morbidity and mortality, and is having a significant financial impact on our society. Improved management of heart failure has resulted in a significant increase in survival, reduced hospitalizations, and improved quality of life for many patients. It can therefore reasonably be expected that adhering to rational medical treatment for these patients could also reduce costs. Management of patients with severe heart failure begins with identifying the etiology and educating patients and their families. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are the cornerstone of therapy, but only after diagnostic tests have been performed to establish the etiology and extent of myocardial dysfunction. Because heart transplantation is a therapeutic option for only a limited number of patients, other surgical and drug therapies must be considered a mainstay of a treatment strategy.",0,0
548,11174914,Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes: lessons from recent studies.,,"Agarwal, R","Hypertension plays a crucial role in causing a high rate of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus. Large studies show that lowering blood pressure has extremely beneficial effects in patients with diabetes and hypertension. This review article discusses recent studies aimed at answering the question of how patients' blood pressure should be reduced and what means should be used to achieve this goal. National Institutes of Health guidelines, published in the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, call for a blood pressure goal of < 130/85 mmHg in patients with diabetes. Based on data from the most recent studies, an even lower blood pressure of <130/80 mmHg appears reasonable in patients with diabetes and hypertension. Observational studies show that the lowest rate of cardiovascular events is observed in patients with diabetes whose systolic blood pressure is < 120 mmHg. Therefore, target blood pressure may need to be lowered to < 120/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes and hypertension. In patients with overt proteinuria of 1 g/day or more, a mean arterial pressure of < 92 mmHg is recommended. The available evidence supports the use of first-line angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors. Because target blood pressure is lower in patients with diabetes who are hypertensive, these patients require the use of multiple agents. Diuretics or long-acting calcium channel blockers are a logical second choice because of their synergistic antihypertensive effects seen with ACE inhibitors. However, alpha-blockers should be used with caution. In patients with renal disease, loop diuretics may be needed to reduce sodium and volume overload and improve blood pressure control.",0,0

Evaluation of treatment with lisinopril and survival.,,"Massie, B M; Armstrong, P W; Cleland, J G; Horowitz, J D; Packer, M; Poole-Wilson, P A; RydÃ©n, L","Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), but most affected patients do not receive these agents or are treated at doses lower than those found in Studies have shown to be effective primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents, particularly at recommended doses. The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high- versus low-dose lisinopril in CHF; The ""Assessment of Lisinopril and Survival"" study was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study in which patients with or without prior treatment with ACE inhibitors were stabilized by receiving lisinopril at an intermediate dose (12.5 or 15.0 mg once daily [OD]) for 2 to 4 weeks and then randomized to high (35.0 or 32.5 mg OD) or low dose (5.0 or 2.5 mg OD) groups. Patients with New York Heart Association Classes II-IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions no greater than 0.30 (n=3164) were randomized and followed for a median of 46 months. We evaluated the occurrence of adverse events and the need for interruption and dose reduction during treatment, with a focus on hypotension and renal dysfunction.; Of 405 patients who had not previously received an ACE inhibitor, only 4.2% of patients were able to abstain due to symptoms possibly related to hypotension (2.0%) or renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia (2.3%). the mean doses required for randomization are titrated. Doses in more than 90% of randomized patients in the high and low dose groups were titrated to their assigned target, and mean doses of blinded medication in both groups remained similar throughout the study. Discontinuations occurred in 27.1% of the high-dose and 30.7% of the low-dose groups. Subgroups considered to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance (blood pressure < 120 mm Hg; creatinine > or = 132.6 micromol/L [> or = 1.5 mg/dl]; age > or = 70 years; and patients with diabetes) generally tolerate the high-dose strategy.; These results demonstrate that ACE inhibitor therapy can be successfully titrated to and maintained at high doses in most patients with CHF, and that more aggressive use of these agents is warranted.",0,0

Measurement of total plasma 14C radioactivity showed that approximately 50% was absorbed after oral administration, with the maximum plasma concentration observed after 0.5 to 1 hour. The absolute bioavailability was 43%. On average, 84% of the total radioactivity in plasma was due to parent compound. The remainder of the total radioactivity could be attributed to the glucuronide conjugate of telmisartan, which was the only human metabolite.

After a washout period of > or = 13 days, subjects were switched to the other medication regimen. The geometric mean of the primary pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state (Day 9) for amlodipine when administered alone were as follows: peak plasma concentration (Cmax) 17.7 ng/mL, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) 331 ng.h /ml and renal clearance 39.5 ml/min, excreting 8% of the total amlodipine dose. When telmisartan was co-administered, the values were 18.7 ng/mL, 352 ng.h/mL and 43.0 mL/min, respectively, with 9.4% of the total amlodipine dose being excreted renally. The limits of the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratios of these steady-state parameters were 0.97 to 1.14 for Cmax and 0.98 to 1.16 for AUC; both were within the predefined reference range (0.8 to 1.25) for bioequivalence. The high inter-individual variability in urinary amlodipine excretion meant that bioequivalence for renal clearance could not be demonstrated. Adverse reactions were minor, mild to moderate in intensity, and transient, whether amlodipine was administered alone or with telmisartan. Vital signs, except blood pressure, and clinical laboratory values were unaffected by either drug. The results of this study demonstrate that telmisartan and amlodipine can be co-administered as there is no clinically significant variation in the primary pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine in the presence of telmisartan and the safety of the combination is comparable to that of amlodipine alone.",0,0
562,11185634,Pharmacokinetics and safety of intravenous and oral telmisartan 20 mg and 120 mg in patients with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects.,,"Stangier, J; Su, C A; SchÃ¶ndorfer, G; Roth, W","The pharmacokinetics and safety of telmisartan were evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment in a single-centre, open-label study. Single oral doses of 20 mg and 120 mg of telmisartan, separated by a 14-day wash-out period, were administered to 12 hepatically-impaired and 12 healthy subjects. A single IV infusion of telmisartan 120 mg was later administered to 5 patients with hepatic impairment who received both oral doses. After oral administration, the pharmacokinetic profile of telmisartan was characterized by rapid absorption and disposition kinetics and a slow terminal elimination phase with mean half-lives of 27 to 42 hours. Peak plasma concentration and area under the telmisartan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) increased 6.4-fold and 2.7-fold for telmisartan 20 mg and 20 mg in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects, respectively by 3.2-fold and 3.1-fold, and for telmisartan 120 mg, respectively. Peak plasma concentrations and AUC0-infinity after iv infusion were significantly increased compared to values from other studies performed in healthy volunteers. Hepatic impairment resulted in an apparent increase in the absolute bioavailability of telmisartan and the total clearance after oral and IV dosing was significantly reduced compared to healthy subjects. Telmisartan plasma protein binding was > or = 99.5% in hepatically-impaired and healthy subjects and was not altered compared to healthy subjects. Oral and IV telmisartan was well tolerated in both hepatic dysfunction and healthy subjects; Headache was the most common potential telmisartan-related adverse reaction. Changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters were transient and without clinical relevance. The good tolerability of telmisartan in patients with hepatic impairment shown in this study, the demonstrated sustained blood pressure control in patients with hypertension and the increased exposure in patients with hepatic impairment suggest that telmisartan can also be an effective treatment in patients with hypertension and hepatic impairment could lowest available telmisartan dose. The increased bioavailability of telmisartan suggests that lower doses of telmisartan should be considered when administering the drug to patients with hepatic impairment.",0,0
563,11185635,Pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 120 mg telmisartan administered during and between hemodialysis in patients with severe renal impairment: comparison with healthy subjects.,,"Stangier, J; Su, C A; Brickl, R; Franke, H","The pharmacokinetics of oral telmisartan 120 mg studied in subjects with severe renal impairment between dialysis sessions and during hemodialysis were compared to those observed in healthy male subjects. Between dialysis and during dialysis, the plasma concentration-time curves of subjects with renal impairment were lower than those of healthy subjects. Mean plasma protein binding of telmisartan in healthy subjects was 99.5% compared to mean values of 99.1% between dialysis and 98.8% during dialysis. Only very small amounts of telmisartan were removed by dialysis. Single doses of telmisartan 120 mg were well tolerated in patients with severe renal impairment when administered either between dialysis sessions or during dialysis, and no clinically relevant changes in vital signs were observed. In conclusion, the peak plasma concentrations of telmisartan and the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves were significantly reduced in subjects with severe renal impairment compared to healthy subjects. The proportion of telmisartan not bound to plasma proteins was increased approximately two-fold. Changes in the pharmacokinetic profile in patients with renal impairment did not affect the safety profile of telmisartan, which was well tolerated in these patients.",0,0
564,11185637,Dose response and safety of telmisartan in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.,,"Smith, D H; Matzek, K M; Kempthorne-Rawson, J","This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluated the dose-response relationship of telmisartan in 207 patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 100 to 114 mmHg). After a 28-day placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to telmisartan 40, 80, or 120 mg once daily, double-blind, double-dummy for 28 days; enalapril 20 mg; or placebo. Blood pressure (BP) was manually recorded 12 hours after the first dose and 24 hours at baseline (Day 0), Day 1 and Day 28 of double-blind treatment. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were determined from telmisartan plasma concentrations. All doses of telmisartan and enalapril significantly reduced blood pressure compared to placebo (p < or = 0.01). Mean +/- SE reductions in supine DBP after 28 days of treatment ranged from 7.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg to 9.8 +/- 1.3 mmHg in the telmisartan groups, 9.6 +/- 1.3 mmHg with enalapril and 1.5 +/- 1.3 mmHg with placebo. Mean +/- SE reductions in supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) ranged from 10.0 +/- 2.2 mmHg to 15.5 +/- 2.2 mmHg with telmisartan versus 10.2 +/- 2, 1 mmHg with enalapril; Placebo increased supine SBP by 3.5 +/- 2.1 mmHg. Blood pressure reductions after 4 weeks of treatment with telmisartan did not differ from those achieved with enalapril. There was no significant linear trend in blood pressure reduction with telmisartan doses. Reductions in SBP and DBP were sustained over the 24 hour period on day 28. Treatment had no effect on supine heart rate. The trough/peak DBP ratios were > or = 85% for all telmisartan doses versus 65% for enalapril. A high inter-subject variability in telmisartan plasma concentrations was observed. For example, the mean +/- SD values for Cmax were 159 +/- 104 ng/mL for telmisartan 40 mg, 693 +/- 606 ng/mL for telmisartan 80 mg, and 1635 +/- 1406 ng/mL for telmisartan 120 mg . Plasma concentration-response analyzes showed that the antihypertensive effects of telmisartan 40, 80 and 120 mg are in the plateau region of the concentration-response curve. All active treatments were well tolerated, with tolerability profiles similar to placebo, and telmisartan produced no clinically relevant effects at the first dose. These data confirm the antihypertensive efficacy and placebo-like tolerability of telmisartan.",0,0

To avoid the metabolic disorders associated with high-dose HCTZ, blood pressure control can be achieved by combining low doses with another antihypertensive agent. The study was designed to assess the tolerability and antihypertensive dose-response efficacy of telmisartan and HCTZ and their combination in black patients with mild to moderate hypertension (mean supine blood pressure 140/95-200/114 mmHg); After a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in period, 222 black patients were randomized to once-daily treatment with one of 20 different double-blind combinations of telmisartan (0, 20, 40, 80, 160 mg) and HCTZ ( 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25 mg) for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was measured at baseline and after 2, 4 and 8 weeks.; Telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg reduced supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the primary efficacy parameter, by 13.3 mmHg and supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 21.5 mmHg. These reductions represented advantages of 13.7/8.7 mmHg over telmisartan 80 mg and 12.3/8.1 mmHg over HCTZ 12.5 mg (p<0.01). Telmisartan 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg reduced supine systolic blood pressure/DBP by 14.3/10.0 mmHg, which was 12.3/3.3 mmHg more than telmisartan 40 mg and 5.1/4.8 mmHg more than HCTZ corresponds to 12.5 mg. This reached significance for the comparisons with telmisartan 40 mg for SBP and HCTZ 12.5 mg for DBP (p<0.05). Response surface analysis and therapeutic response rates confirmed the additive antihypertensive effect of telmisartan and HCTZ. All treatments were well tolerated, with side effect profiles comparable to placebo. Adverse events were mainly transient and mild to moderate in severity.; Telmisartan 80 mg in combination with HCTZ 12.5 mg is effective and well tolerated in black patients with mild to moderate hypertension and provides a greater antihypertensive effect than the corresponding monotherapies.",0,0

Although diltiazem is characterized as an HR-lowering calcium antagonist, no studies have quantified the extent of HR changes in patients with angina pectoris or hypertension.; The study was conducted to investigate the extent of the proportional reduction in heart rate at different levels of resting heart rate with the sustained-release formulation of diltiazem (SR-diltiazem) at the usual clinical doses of 200 or 300 mg once daily; This meta-analysis was performed on six double-blind comparative studies in 771 patients with angina pectoris or hypertension, comparing SR diltiazem 200-300 mg once daily with either placebo or other drugs known not to affect heart rate (angiotensin -Converting enzyme inhibitors). , diuretics). Sustained-release diltiazem decreases an elevated baseline heart rate, with an increasing effect at higher initial rates.; Multiple comparisons by baseline HR category showed a significant difference between both groups for baseline HR of 74-84 bpm and > or = 85 bpm (p = 0.001). Sustained-release diltiazem had no significant HF lowering effect on baseline HF of < or = 74 beats/min, but appears to have a true regulatory effect on HF: it reduces tachycardia without inducing excessive bradycardia. These results are in contrast to those with dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, which tend to increase heart rate and have been associated with an adverse outcome in acute cardiovascular disease. At the same time, there is evidence that heart rate-lowering calcium channel blockers reduce the frequency of cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction. If calcium channel blockers are indicated for use in patients with angina pectoris or hypertension, a heart rate lowering agent, ie diltiazem instead of dihydropyridine, should be recommended.",0,0

Additional references were also retrieved from selected articles.; Since most published CHF studies have been conducted with candesartan and losartan, these agents are the focus of this article. However, all identified comparative clinical studies were reviewed and included, regardless of the active substance used.; AgII receptor antagonists inhibit the action of AgII at its subtype 1 receptor, regardless of the pathway of AgII synthesis. They exhibit a similar hemodynamic profile to ACE inhibitors, without neurohormonal reflex activation. They have been shown to be at least as effective as ACE inhibitors in improving symptoms, exercise capacity and New York Heart Association functional class in CHF patients. Although the ELITE study (Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly) indicated that losartan improved survival compared to captopril, this study was not designed to examine mortality. ELITE-II, a well-researched study, showed no difference in mortality between patients taking captopril and those taking losartan. The combination of AgII receptor antagonists and ACE inhibitors provides additional benefit in terms of blood pressure reduction and prevention of ventricular remodeling. AgII receptor antagonists are well tolerated, with a similar or lower incidence of adverse events than ACE inhibitors. Their lack of action on bradykinin clearance may explain their lower incidence of cough.; The accumulated data in patients with CHF to date make it clear that ACE inhibitors must remain the treatment of choice and that AgII receptor antagonists can be considered as an acceptable alternative for patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors.",0,0
569,11201013,The role of ACE inhibitors in the management of hypertensive elderly patients.,,"Gosch, M","Hypertension has a high prevalence in elderly patients. Randomized trials have already shown that treating healthy elderly people with high blood pressure is very effective. Nevertheless, some questions have arisen. On the one hand, the generalizability of these study results, especially for older people with serious medical comorbidities and a poor functional status, is not clear. On the other hand, various antihypertensive drugs have proven to be effective. Which drug for which patient? Even data from randomized intervention trials showing that treatment affects cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were lacking. ACE inhibitors have been used to treat hypertension for more than a decade. For a younger population, the Captopril Prevention Project showed no differences between ACE inhibitors and conventional antihypertensive treatment (diuretics, beta-blockers) on the primary endpoints (myocardial infarction, stroke and other cardiovascular deaths). The STOP-2 study also confirmed these results for older patients. When treating elderly patients, the physiological changes with age and comorbidities must be taken into account. Declining kidney function is important in this group of patients. Admissions for uraemia associated with the use of ACE inhibitors remain common, although many cases are preventable with monitoring of renal function, but guidelines are still lacking. In the comorbidities, ACE inhibitors have advantages over other antihypertensive drugs, particularly in heart failure, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.",0,0

It was not known whether vascular insulin resistance could be improved by antihypertensive therapy in this setting. Therefore, we determined the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy on vascular sensitivity to insulin in hypertensive patients on a sodium-restricted diet.; The effects of 3 months of quinapril therapy on vascular insulin sensitivity were evaluated in 11 hypertensive subjects using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Vascular sensitivity to insulin was assessed by determining the insulin ED50 from a linear variable differential transformer of the dorsal palmar vein in phenylephrine-preconstricted vessels. Subjects were maintained on a sodium diet of 75 mmol/day for 3 days prior to each study; Quinapril therapy significantly improved vascular sensitivity to insulin as evidenced by a decrease in the ED50 for insulin (ED50 insulin: placebo = 501 +/- 189 [muU/min; quinapril = 276 +/- 100 muU/min P < 0.05]) was found. Isoproterenol-mediated relaxation was also enhanced by quinapril treatment (maximum isoproterenol-mediated relaxation: placebo = 92 +/- 15% of baseline stretch; quinapril = 151 +/- 31% P<0.05); The current study suggests that the ACE inhibitor quinapril has beneficial effects on vascular function in general and on insulin-mediated vascular responses in particular.",0,0

Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were measured by a constant infusion technique. [131I]iodohippurate (hippuran) and [125I]iothalamate served as reference substances. The lithium clearance method was used to measure renal water and sodium handling. Microalbuminuria was measured. A subcutaneous buttock biopsy was taken and the ratio of median thickness to lumen diameter of small resistance vessels was determined. The left ventricular mass index was determined by echocardiography. Thirty-seven patients with newly diagnosed or poorly controlled essential hypertension were randomized to treatment with regimens based on either isradipine, perindopril, or hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride. Atenolol and hydralazine were added as secondary and tertiary drugs, respectively, when needed to normalize diastolic blood pressure. Examinations were carried out before and after 9 months normalization of blood pressure. Renal function in untreated hypertensive patients was characterized by increased renal vascular resistance, decreased renal blood flow, normal glomerular filtration fraction, and normal serum creatinine. No relationship was found between peripheral resistance vessel structure in subcutaneous vessels and renal hemodynamic parameters. Patients with severe left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass > 360 g) had a lower glomerular filtration fraction, higher renal vascular resistance, lower renal blood flow, and increased microalbuminuria compared to patients with less pronounced cardiac changes. After one year of treatment, which had profound effects on cardiac and vascular structure, renal hemodynamics were unchanged in patients receiving antihypertensive regimens based on the ACE inhibitor perindopril or the Ca antagonist isradipine, while renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were unchanged were conserved and filtration fraction significantly increased in those treated with a diuretic-based regimen.

This was a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter, observational study in a cohort of 156 male and female patients over 18 years of age and with essential hypertension. All had previously received the fixed combination enalapril/HCTZ 20/6 mg as the only antihypertensive drug for at least 4 weeks. Office BP was the average of three measurements. A semi-automatic device (OMRON HEM 705 CP) was used for blood pressure at home. The patients measured their blood pressure twice a day for 2 consecutive days. The mean differences between the two measurement methods were small but significant: 3.99 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP; p<0.05), 2.02 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP; p<0.05). Pearson's regression coefficient between office and home values was highly significant (p<0.0001) for SBP, DBP, and heart rate. Home blood pressure measurement was highly reproducible, as shown by the high within-class correlation coefficient for individual measurements on day one compared to day two: 0.88 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.82-0.92; p<0.00001 ) for SBP and 0.89 for DBP (95% CI 0.83-0.93; p<0.00001). The percentage of patients with strict DBP and SBD control (< 140/90 mmHg) was 61.3% and with DBP control (< 90 mmHg) 92%.

Budesonide suspension for inhalation (BIS) is a glucocorticoid with high topical and low systemic activity. In children ages 12 months to 8 years, BIS improves asthma symptoms and lung function, and reduces the need for breakthrough bronchodilators. Long-term follow-up studies in children concluded that BIS is well tolerated with little or no effect on growth and function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

577,11217909,The ACE gene polymorphism and the cough threshold for capsaicin after the use of cilazapril.,,"Takahashi, T; Yamaguchi, E; Furuya, K; Kawakami, Y","Persistent dry cough is an uncommon but clinically important side effect of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEI). The reported incidence is variable, and why cough occurs only in certain individuals has been unclear. An insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with serum ACE activity. We have previously shown that ACEI-induced susceptibility to cough is associated with this polymorphism, such that patients with genotype II are more susceptible to cough than patients with other genotypes. To confirm and extend our earlier observation, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study in 10 healthy genotype II and 10 genotype DD volunteers. The cough threshold was determined by the concentration of inhaled capsaicin that caused two or more coughs. After 4 weeks of use of an ACEI, cilazapril, changes in cough threshold in subjects with genotype II [previous: 6.6 +/- 3.7 nM (mean +/- standard deviation); after: 5.0 +/- 4.6 nM] differed significantly from those in subjects with genotype DD (before: 9.0 +/- 9.4 nM; after: 9.3 +/- 9.1 nM) . Skin reactions to intradermal bradykinin, which is a substrate of ACE and Tussigen, were significantly increased in subjects with genotype II (before: 1.6 +/- 0.6 vs. after: 2.6 +/- 0.5 cm2, P < 0.05), but not in subjects with genotype DD (before: 1.4+/-0.5 vs. after: 1.6+/-0.6 cm2, ns) after administration of cilazapril.

Another less appreciated potential downside is their tendency to cause weight gain in some patients. In 8 evaluable prospective randomized controlled trials lasting >/= 6 months, body weight in the beta-blocker group was higher than in the control group at the end of the study. The median difference in body weight was 1.2 kg (range -0.4 to 3.5 kg). A regression analysis suggested that beta-blockers were associated with initial weight gain in the first few months. Thereafter, no further weight gain was evident compared to the controls. There was no association between demographic characteristics and changes in body weight. Based on these observations, the first-line use of beta-blockers in obese hypertensive patients should be reviewed.

586,11232737,Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the elderly: special considerations.,,"Rosenstock, J","The principles of treating type 2 diabetes mellitus in the elderly are no different from those in younger patients, but priorities and therapeutic strategies need to be carefully individualized. The goals of treatment are to improve glycemic control in a stepwise approach that includes non-pharmacological methods, including diet and exercise, and pharmacological therapy, including mixtures of oral antihyperglycemia alone or in combination with insulin. Although treatment goals may be the same for older and younger patients, certain aspects of type 2 diabetes in older patients require special attention. Treatment decisions are influenced by age and life expectancy, comorbidities, and the severity of vascular complications. Adherence to dietary therapy, physical activity, and medication regimens can be compromised by comorbid conditions and psychosocial limitations. Drug-induced hypoglycemia was the main consideration and the most serious potential complication. In addition, the long-term macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes are a source of significant morbidity and mortality. Indeed, in a significant number of patients, vascular and neuropathic complications are already present at the time of diagnosis, and the implications of improved diabetes control depend on the patient's age and life expectancy. Age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and the potential for adverse events and drug-drug interactions should also be considered when choosing appropriate pharmacological therapy. In general, a conservative and stepwise approach is recommended for the management of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes; Treatment can be initiated with monotherapy, followed by early intervention with a combination of oral agents, including a sulfonylurea as the basal insulin creagogic in addition to a supplemental insulin sensitizer. Finally, insulin therapy is required if significant hyperglycemia [glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) > 8%] persists despite oral combination therapy. Combination therapy with evening insulin and a long-acting sulfonylurea such as glimepiride is an effective strategy for improving hyperglycemia in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes who are unsuccessful on polypharmacy with oral agents. Also, such a regimen is easy to follow for the patient who may not be able to stick to a more complicated insulin regimen. Hyperglycemia in the elderly can be well managed with practical measures and a simple treatment plan to improve compliance. Optimal blood sugar control should be possible with individual treatment for each patient; However, tight glycemic control may not be achievable in all patients, or even desirable in many elderly patients.",0,0

Insulin resistance is characterized by impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake. The involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of hyperinsulinemia in EH patients has not been clearly proven. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI, enalapril = 10 mg/day) (9 male patients) or an angiotensin II AT-1 receptor blocker (A II RB = losartan 50 mg/day).

Customization of drug therapy offers the potential for optimal safety and efficacy in a single patient. Such a process contrasts with current prescribing practices that use drugs that have been shown to be safe and effective in patient populations or are based on anecdotal experience. Within patient populations, drugs vary in their effectiveness in individual patients. More importantly, a drug that is safe and effective in one patient may be ineffective or even harmful in another. Underlying many of these phenotypic differences are genotypic variants (polymorphisms) of key enzymes and proteins that affect a drug's safety and efficacy in an individual patient. Understanding these polymorphisms has the potential to improve patient care by allowing physicians to tailor drug choices to individual patient needs. Pharmacogenomics can also lead to improved compliance and reduced time to optimal disease management, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality. Significant cost savings could result from a reduction in polypharmacy, as well as fewer physician visits and hospitalizations due to exacerbations of the underlying disease and adverse drug reactions.",0,0

At the end of each study phase, trough blood pressure was measured by conventional blood pressure measurement and ambulatory blood pressure was monitored over 24 hours using a Spacelabs device. Analysis of 24-hour BP profile included calculation of 24-hour, day, night and hourly average values.; In the 178 patients evaluable per protocol, at the end of 8 weeks of treatment, trough levels of systolic (S) and diastolic (D) blood pressure were similarly reduced by both active treatments (13 +/- 12 and 10 +/- 7 mm Hg for CC and 14 +/- 12 and 10 +/- 7 mm Hg for E) and significantly more for both treatments than for P (6 +/- 11 and 7 +/- 8 mm Hg, P < 0.01 v CC and E ).

598,11248763,Heart failure therapy at the turn of the century.,,"Goldstein, S","Major changes in the treatment of heart failure have occurred in the last fifty years, which have had a dramatic impact on morbidity and mortality. More than two hundred years have passed since the benefits of digitalis in heart failure were demonstrated before the development of effective loop diuretics. The observation that vasodilators can improve both cardiac function and mortality led to the study of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). Although these agents exhibited significant vasodilator properties, their primary utility appears to be related to their ability to cause remodeling of the failing left ventricle. The most recent randomized clinical trials indicate that beta-blockers can have an incremental effect on both mortality and morbidity when added to ACEI therapy. Although these agents improved the outlook for patients with heart failure, they had very little effect on improving left ventricular function.

All patients underwent reperfusion therapy.; Echocardiography was performed on day 1 (before randomization), day 14, and day 90 after myocardial infarction. Left ventricular volume and ejection fraction were measured and wall motion analyzes were performed at all three time points in 249 patients and at baseline in an additional 12 patients who died during follow-up. Echocardiographic and non-chocardiographic predictors of ventricular recovery were examined.; At Day 90, 55 of 252 (22%) patients presenting with abnormal ejection fraction and wall motion abnormalities on Day 1 showed full recovery of function (ejection fraction within normal range and infarct segment length of 0%), and an additional 36% (91 of 252 patients) showed partial recovery of function. After 90 days, 53% (132 of 249) of patients had an improvement in ejection fraction of more than 5%, while only 16% (39 of 249) had a decrease in ejection fraction of more than 5%.

One hundred eighty-seven patients with anterior AMI were included in the present study. In all cases, serum creatinine concentrations and serum K concentrations were < 2.0 mg/dL and < 5.5 mmol/L, respectively. Patients were randomized into two groups: the canrenoate group included 94 patients who received captopril and canrenoate 25 mg IV (1 mg/hour for the first 72 hours and then orally 25 mg/day), while the placebo group (93 patients) received captopril and placebo. Echocardiography was performed in all patients on admission and on days 10, 90, and 180 to measure end-systolic volume (ESV), ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic diameter, E/A ratio, E-deceleration time determine the isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) and the E and A peak velocities.; Non-reperfused patients showed no patency of the infarcted artery, while in reperfused patients this vessel was patent (7-10 days after AMI). The two groups were similar in age, sex, incidence of diabetes, smoking habit, hypertension, creatine kinase enzymatic peak, adjuvant therapy, baseline EF, ESV, and incidence of coronary artery bypass graft/coronary angioplasty. After 10 days of treatment (canrenoate group), only 9 patients had serum K and creatinine concentrations > 5.5 mmol/l and > 2.0 mg/dl, respectively. In patients receiving canrenoate, the mitral I/O ratio was higher compared to placebo (p=0.001), while ESV was significantly reduced (p<0.05). The lag time was longer in reperfused patients receiving canrenoate than that observed in reperfused patients in the placebo group. The group-internal EF was significantly increased (p = 0.042). Compared to the placebo group, IVRT was significantly higher in non-perfused patients receiving canrenoate than in the placebo group (p=0.001).

604,11258145,Renal Effects of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors Leading to Cost Savings and Improved Patient Outcomes.,,"Swislocki, A L; Siegel, D","In some patients with kidney disease, the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is thought to improve kidney function, while in others their use causes deterioration. Many questions remain about the categories of patients who benefit from the use of ACE inhibitors.; To clarify the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with kidney disease.; A literature review was conducted focusing on various renal diseases, ACE inhibitors and cost-effectiveness criteria.; Almost 100 clinical studies were reviewed. Treatment with ACE inhibitors appears to have beneficial effects in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus with nephropathy, AIDS nephropathy and other non-diabetic kidney diseases. The use of these agents in these diseases reduces kidney disease progression and the need for dialysis, leading to potential cost savings and improved quality of life. Data supporting target blood pressures indicate the need to aggressively reduce this risk factor. The use of ACE inhibitors is dangerous in bilateral renal artery stenosis, especially volume depletion, but may be useful in patients with unilateral stenosis. Treatment with ACE inhibitors is likely to be beneficial in African Americans, although the doses required may be higher than in whites and caution is advised in certain situations. The potential efficacy of angiotensin receptor blockers and other new drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system will be evaluated.; The use of ACE inhibitors has benefits in renal disease states characterized by increased glomerular perfusion pressure, but their use in other renal disease states, particularly those characterized by decreased glomerular perfusion pressure, may be risky. The benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy in terms of cost savings and improved quality of life are so dramatic that their use should be strongly encouraged in specific clinical settings in managed care and other practice settings.",0,0

Uncontrolled studies suggest that biventricular pacing improves hemodynamics and well-being at multiple sites by reducing ventricular asynchrony. We evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of this new therapy; Sixty-seven patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III) due to chronic left ventricular systolic dysfunction with normal sinus rhythm and QRS interval duration greater than 150 ms received transvenous atriobiventricular pacemakers (with leads in one atrium and each ventricle). This single-blind, randomized, controlled, crossover study compared patient responses over two periods: a 3-month period of inactive pacing (ventricular inhibited pacing with a base rate of 40 bpm) and a 3-month period of active (atriobiventricular) pacing. The primary endpoint was distance traveled in six minutes; secondary endpoints were questionnaire-based quality of life, peak oxygen consumption, heart failure-related hospitalizations, patient treatment preference (active vs. inactive pacing), and mortality rate.; Nine patients were withdrawn from the study prior to randomization and 10 failed to complete both study periods. Thus, 48 patients completed both phases of the study.

In addition, the eyeball EF was estimated using 2-D echo and cineangiography and compared to conventional methods. The agreement between the results was evaluated by the method of Bland and Altman.; The agreement between 2D echo and cineangiography results was poor. Mean differences (MD) were -21.8 (EDVI, ml/m(2)), -9.5 (ESVI, ml/m(2)), and -0.9 (EF, %) for the 2nd -D-echo method of intervertebral discs versus cineangiography and -23.2, -9.3 and -5.7 for 2-D echo with area length versus cineangiography. For EF (%), MD was -3.6 for eyeball cineangiography versus cineangiography, -1.3 for eyeball 2D echo versus disc method, and +0.30 for eyeball 2D echo versus surface length 2D echo. Two-dimensional echo is likely to underestimate LV volumes compared to cineangiography, especially for the largest volumes. Even with EF, discrepancies are large, with 21% to 25% disagreement between conventional methods, but agreement is better between eyeball EF and conventional methods.; Even with modern echocardiographic equipment, the agreement between 2-D echo and cineangiography-derived LV volumes and EF remains moderate, and both methods must not be considered interchangeable in clinical practice.",0,0

Dose-related adverse drug events (ADEs) often cause compliance problems, and many ADEs occur with the starting dose of antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, it is an established policy to initiate low-dose antihypertensive therapy to avoid ADEs, which reduce patient quality of life and compliance. However, what are the lowest effective doses of antihypertensive drugs?; Comparison of starting doses recommended in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) to those recommended in the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC VI).; Review of the latest JNC VI report (1997) and the 1999 and 2000 editions of the PDR and medical literature.; The JNC VI recommends significantly lower starting doses for 23 (58%) of 40 drugs compared to the PDR. In addition, for 37 (82%) of 45 drugs, the PDR guidelines do not recommend lower starting doses for elderly or frail patients than for younger adults.; Although the PDR is the drug reference most commonly used by physicians, it does not reflect the lowest starting doses recommended by the JNC VI for many of the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs. Because avoidance of ADEs is essential to maintaining compliance with antihypertensive therapy, and because many antihypertensive ADEs are dose-dependent, physicians need to be aware of the lowest, most effective, and least prone to ADE doses.

Although ACE inhibitors improve LV function, their beneficial role in exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias has not been established. To investigate the effects of ACE inhibitors on exercise capacity compared to their role in exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, 25 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) of various etiologies in NYHA classes II and III were subjected to a prospective randomized controlled trial. The control group consisting of 12 patients received conventional treatment (digitalis and diuretics) and the test group additionally received enalapril/captopril depending on tolerability. They were followed up for 3 months. Treadmill exercise testing and monitoring of clinical and biochemical parameters were performed in all cases at baseline and at the end of the study. Ventricular arrhythmias observed during exercise and for 10 minutes after exercise were analyzed using Lown's score for frequency and severity of ventricular arrhythmias. The mean exercise duration showed a significant improvement among ACE inhibitors compared to the control group (p<0.05), however, there was no significant change in the degrees of arrhythmia. Serum electrolytes and other biochemical parameters were within the normal range.

Compared to nifedipine-GITS, verapamil-SR produced a significantly lower resting and peak exercise heart rate. Nifedipine-GITS elicited a lower peak systolic BP. At the end of the titration, nifedipine-GITS resulted in lower atrial plasma natriuretic peptide levels that were no longer evident at 6 months. Plasma norepinephrine was lower with verapamil-SR, also at the end of titration and at 3 months but not at 6 months. Plasma epinephrine and plasma renin activity remained unchanged for both drugs. There was no difference in systolic or diastolic left ventricular function or coronary flow reserve between the two treatments. Once daily, nifedipine-GITS and verapamil-SR are equally effective in lowering arterial pressure in moderate to severe hypertension. Differences in their hemodynamic profiles and neurohormonal responses are consistent with preclinical pharmacological properties. The clinical implications of their similarities and differences have yet to be fully evaluated in outcome studies.",0,0
619,11281235,"ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium blockers, and diuretics to control systolic hypertension.",,"Morgan, T O; Anderson, A I; MacInnis, R J","The aim of this study was to determine which of the popular groups of antihypertensive drugs is most effective in lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in elderly patients with previously untreated hypertension and the percentage of patients controlled with single or sequential monotherapy became. Subjects were recruited from patients attending other outpatient clinics and included in the study if their SBP was greater than 150 mm Hg after three visits. The patients received a low and a high dose of each of the main classes of medicines or a placebo for one month. The study was a balanced, randomized, crossover design with five periods: placebo; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; beta blockers; calcium-blocking drugs; and thiazide diuretics. Blood pressure (BP) was measured 24 to 26 hours after the previous dose. An adverse event questionnaire was administered at each visit. 74 patients participated in the study. Beta blockers could not be used in 15 patients because of asthma or bronchospasm and these had two placebo periods. There were 9 of 66 patients on P, 9 of 46 on beta-blockers, 4 of 65 on calcium blockers, 4 of 65 on diuretics, and 1 of 62 patients on ACE inhibitors who did not cross over to the higher dose because of side effects. Decreases in SBP compared to randomized placebo were calcium blockers 15 mm Hg = diuretic 13 mm Hg > ACE inhibitors 8 mm Hg = beta blockers 5 mm Hg. Drop in blood pressure correlated with placebo blood pressure (p<0.0005, r=0.53 to 0.70). With placebo correction, target SBP (<140 mm Hg) was achieved in 6% to 15% of patients on monotherapy. Sequential monotherapy achieved the goal in 29%. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium-blocking drugs, and diuretics had no more side effects than placebo. Patients on beta-blockers had more side effects and reduced well-being scores. Diuretics and calcium-blocking drugs are more effective in lowering SBP pressure in elderly patients. Beta blockers were relatively ineffective, often contraindicated, and had more side effects. Monotherapy achieved control in only a small number of patients. Therapy with diuretics or calcium-blocking drugs should be initiated in elderly people with essential hypertension, but combination therapy is usually required to achieve the goal.",0,0

In diabetics, verapamil and diltiazem appear to be more effective than dihydropyridines in reducing urinary protein excretion and have additive effects with ACEI, but there is little information on chronic treatment of non-diabetic nephropathies for non-dihydropyridine CCBs. To test whether the combination of verapamil 180 mg or amlodipine 5 mg with trandolapril 2 mg reduces urinary protein excretion more than trandolapril 2 mg alone, we designed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study.

Antihypertensive drugs acting through different pathophysiological mechanisms may confer specific target organ protection beyond what is already provided by their antihypertensive effects.; Thirty-one patients with essential hypertension were randomized to long-term treatment with either a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine GITS, 90 mg/day) or an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril, 20 mg/day). Blood pressure, left ventricular mass, carotid wall thickness, and time-controlled urinary albumin excretion were measured at baseline and over the course of 24 months of treatment.; Both treatment regimens significantly reduced mean blood pressure over the 24 months (from 124 +/- 2 to 103 +/- 2 mmHg in the lisinopril group and from 122 +/- 2 to 104 +/- 1 in the nifedipine group). Overall, end-organ damage improved with continued blood pressure control. However, the two treatments had different specific effects. Lisinopril induced a more pronounced reduction in left ventricular mass index (from 56+/-3 to 52+/-2 g/m2.7, P<0.05) and urinary albumin excretion (from 34+/-15 to 9+/- 2 micrograms/min, P < 0.01), while nifedipine achieved a greater reduction in carotid intima plus media thickness (from 0.8 +/- 0.06 to 0.6 +/- 0.06 mm, P < 0.01); Blood pressure control helps reduce the severity of organ damage in patients with essential hypertension. Various antihypertensive treatments can provide additional specific cardio-renal and vascular protection independent of blood pressure control.

We also hypothesized that ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers would favorably affect the measured indices.; In cross-sectional analysis, plasma viscosity (p=0.001), fibrinogen (p=0.02), vWF (p<0.0001), and soluble P-selectin (p<0.001) were increased in patients with CHF compared to healthy controls. Females showed greater abnormalities in haemorheological indices and vWF than males (all P < 0.05). Plasma viscosity (P=0.009) and fibrinogen levels (P=0.0014) were higher in patients with more severe symptoms (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III-IV), but there was no association with left ventricular ejection fraction.

625,11288962,Angiotensin receptor blockers: evidence for target organ preservation.,,"Carson, P; Giles, T; Higginbotham, M; Hollenberg, N; Kannel, W; Siragy, H M","Hypertension is a major problem throughout the developed world. Although current antihypertensive treatment regimens reduce morbidity and mortality, patients are often noncompliant and medications may not fully normalize blood pressure. As a result, current therapy often does not prevent or reverse the cardiovascular remodeling that often occurs when blood pressure is chronically elevated. Blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is effective in controlling hypertension and treating congestive heart failure. Both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibit RAS activity, but these two classes of antihypertensive drugs have different mechanisms of action and different pharmacological profiles. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors block a single pathway in the production of angiotensin II (Ang II). In addition, angiotensin I is not the only substrate for ACE. The ACE inhibitors also block the breakdown of bradykinin, which could have potential benefits in cardiovascular disease. However, bradykinin is the suspected cause of cough associated with ACE inhibitor therapy. Data from clinical trials of ACE inhibitors are designed to support the involvement of the RAS in the development of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin receptor blockers act distally in the RAS to selectively block the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor. Therefore, ARBs are more specific agents and avoid many side effects. Experimental and clinical studies have documented the effectiveness of ARBs in preserving target organ function and reversing cardiovascular remodeling. In some cases, maximum benefit can be obtained with Ang II blockade that uses both ARBs and ACE inhibitors. This review describes clinical studies documenting the effectiveness of ARBs in protecting the myocardium, blood vessels, and renal vessels.",0,0

Our study was designed to examine whether these effects reside in an improvement in underlying glomerular structural abnormalities. A total of 54 type 1 diabetic patients with albuminuria and blood pressure (BP) < 150/90 mmHg were randomized in a multicentre, double-blind study over 3 years to receive enalapril 10 mg once daily, nifedipine prolonged-release 10 mg twice daily, or placebo for a period of time. A renal biopsy was performed at baseline and at follow-up, and tissue was analyzed using standard morphometric methods. Blood pressure, GFR, albumin excretion rate (AER) and HbA1c were measured every 6 months. Enalapril reduced AER by 26% (p<0.05) at 6 months; However, this reduction was not maintained after 3 years.

Since most ADEs are dose-dependent phenomena, tailoring drug dosage to individual patient needs and tolerability is fundamental to good therapeutics.; To determine whether the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR), the leading source of drug information for physicians, provides the full spectrum of effective drug doses, particularly the lowest and least ADE-prone doses of drugs that physicians consider when treating patients should. ; Review of dosing guidelines and dose-response information in the PDR. Comparison to dose-response data from articles listed in MEDLINE from 1966 to 2000.; For many types of medication, doctors are often advised to use the lowest effective drug dose, especially initially. Nevertheless, effective low doses determined in pre-release studies or in post-release work are often removed from the PDR, even when recommended by expert panels.; Optimal therapy depends on the availability of comprehensive information. However, the PDR only includes the limited dose information from package inserts. Because the PDR was originally developed as a promotional tool, there is no mechanism by which all clinically relevant dose-response data or important post-release discoveries are regularly and rapidly incorporated into it. Thus, there is a gap in the availability of up-to-date and comprehensive dose information for physicians. This article provides information on lower, effective doses for 48 major drugs with an extensive reference list - a compilation of low dose information previously unpublished in the medical literature, to our knowledge.

However, a multitude of studies suggest that the positive relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular mortality is weakened or even reversed in the very old. Most intervention studies to date have either excluded or insufficiently recruited patients aged > or = 80 years to determine whether treatment provides significant benefit in this age group. A meta-analysis of intervention studies recruiting patients aged > or = 80 years has suggested a benefit in terms of stroke reduction but also raised the possibility of an increase in all-cause mortality. The benefit-risk balance must therefore be clearly established before recommendations for the treatment of elderly patients with hypertension can be made. The Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) pilot project recruited 1283 patients aged > or = 80 years and demonstrated the feasibility of conducting such a study in this age group. It was a Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-Points (PROBE) design, but the main study has additional pharmaceutical funding to conduct a double-blind study. Therefore, the main study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the benefit of treatment in very elderly patients with hypertension. It compares placebo with a low-dose diuretic (sustained-release indapamide 1.5 mg daily) and add-on therapy with an ACE inhibitor (perindopril) if required. As in the pilot study, stroke (fatal and non-fatal) is the primary endpoint and the study is designed to determine whether or not there is a 35% difference between placebo and active treatment. The main objective is achieved with 90% power at the 1% significance level. Secondary outcome measures include all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiac mortality, stroke mortality, and skeletal fracture. 2100 patients aged > or = 80 years are to be recruited and followed up for an average of 5 years. Entry criteria for BP at 2 months of a single-blind placebo run-in period are sustained seated systolic BP (SBP) of 160 to 199 mm Hg and diastolic BP of 90 to 109 mm Hg. Standing SBP must be > be 140mmHg. The study is carried out according to the principles of good clinical practice.

Patients with renal impairment had a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular death (11.4% vs. 6.6%) and all-cause mortality (17.8% vs. 10.6%) (p<0.001 for both comparisons). The impact of renal impairment on the primary endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.16 to 1.69]) was independent of known cardiovascular risks and treatment. Ramipril reduced the incidence of the primary endpoint in patients with and without renal impairment (hazard ratio 0.80 vs. 0.79; P > 0.2 for the difference); In patients with pre-existing vascular disease or diabetes combined with an additional cardiovascular risk factor, mild renal impairment significantly increased the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events.

We used Cox regression to correlate the outcome with baseline serum creatinine and uric acid measured in 1880 and 1873, respectively, out of 2394 patients enrolled in placebo-controlled systolic hypertension in China (Syst-China); The median follow-up time was 3 years. In multiple Cox regression analysis adjusting for gender, age, active treatment, and other significant covariates, serum creatinine was significantly associated with poorer prognosis. The relative risk rates (95% CIs) associated with a 20 micromol/L increase in serum creatinine for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and stroke were 1.16 (1.05 to 1.27, P=0.003), 1.15 (1 .01 to 1.31, P=0.03) and 1.37 (1.13 to 1.65, P=0.001), respectively.

After a 4-week placebo run-in period, nine patients with essential hypertension entered the double-blind phase of the study, which consisted of three 6-week periods in which the patients received placebo, enalapril 20 mg once daily, or losartan 50 mg od losartan and enalapril taken between 07:00 and 08:00 reduced ambulatory blood pressure over the 24-hour period. Mean nocturnal blood pressure was reduced from 133/85 mm Hg with placebo to 124/78 mm Hg with enalapril and 126/77 mm Hg with losartan. The mean daytime blood pressure for placebo was 157/101 mm Hg and was significantly lower for enalapril (142/91 mm Hg) than for losartan (147/95 mm Hg). Clinical BP, measured 2 to 4 hours after drug intake, was reduced to the same extent by both drugs. Losartan-induced BP changes were significantly related to those with enalapril (0.63 < r < 0.93). Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was repeated in six patients after 4 weeks of combined therapy. The blood pressure lowering effect of the combination was not significantly better than that achieved with enalapril alone. In summary, losartan 50 mg once daily and enalapril 20 mg once daily reduced blood pressure to about the same extent, with the exception of a more pronounced effect of enalapril on daytime ambulatory blood pressure. The current study does not provide convincing evidence that adding losartan to enalapril at the doses used further reduces blood pressure.",0,0

There was a well-tolerated decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DRP). There were no significant adverse drug events. Only the sedentary SBP and the sedentary DBP were significantly lowered by fosinopril and verapamil SR. Because lowering both SBP and DBP has been shown to be beneficial in elderly hypertensive patients, these results become even more important in the selection of medication for antihypertensive therapy in the elderly. The increase in norepinephrine in fosinopril-treated patients may explain why patients treated with long-term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors alone or in combination with diuretics rarely complain of orthostatic symptoms.",0,0

Given the positive influence of doxazosin on lipid levels in addition to its antihypertensive effect, it is hypothesized that treatment with doxazosin will reduce the incidence of macrovascular complications. A Markov model was constructed for each country to simulate macrovascular outcomes in patients on different drug combinations. The transition probabilities were based on the risk rates presented in UKPDS 38. Risk rates were adjusted for cohort age and the lipid-lowering properties of doxazosin using Framingham risk equations.

Forty-two patients were randomized to treatment with either perindopril, slow-release nifedipine, or placebo. In the first 3 months, drug dosage was titrated to achieve at least a 5 mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure: 33 patients had at least 24 months of data, and 25 patients were followed beyond 36 months (mean, 67 +/- 4 Months). Patients were examined every 3 months and at the end of the treatment period; those who remained normotensive discontinued therapy and were followed up for an additional 3 months. The geometric mean albumin excretion rates (AERs) at baseline were as follows: perindopril, 66 micrograms/min; nifedipine, 59 micrograms/minute; and placebo, 66 micrograms/min. During the first 3 years, normoalbuminuria recurred in 7 of the perindopril-treated patients but none of the placebo- or nifedipine-treated patients (p<0.01). The median AERs after 3 years of treatment in each group were 23 micrograms/min for perindopril, 122 micrograms/min for nifedipine and 112 micrograms/min for placebo patients (p<0.01). In patients with a follow-up of more than 3 years, the median AERs decreased by 45% in the first year and then stabilized in the perindopril group but increased by 17.6% in the nifedipine group and by 27.6% in the Placebo group (p<0.03) for the first year, then gradually increased. In the same patients, there was a significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate in the nifedipine group (-7.8 +/- 1.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year) but not in the other two groups ( Perindopril, -1.0 +/- 1.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year Placebo, -1.3 +/- 1.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/ year; p=0.004). At the end of the study, cessation of treatment for 3 months was associated with a doubling of AERs in the perindopril-treated group but with no change in the other two groups (p<0.001). In conclusion, long-term therapy with perindopril is more effective than nifedipine or placebo in delaying the progression of diabetic nephropathy and reducing the AER to the normoalbuminuric range (< 20 micrograms/min) in normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes and microalbuminuria. to lower.",0,0

Contrary to the original hypothesis, the benefits of angiotensin antagonism are not based solely on the antihypertensive effect. Subsequent extensive research on angiotensin blockade suggests that the benefits of this approach may also result from the pharmacological alteration of endothelial cell function and resulting changes in the biology of the vasculature. The recent availability of direct antagonists of the AT(1) angiotensin receptor has introduced an element of doubt into this area of clinical decision making. The receptor antagonists and the more widely studied converting enzyme inhibitors share many endpoint attributes. Nevertheless, the partially overlapping mechanisms of action for the two classes of angiotensin antagonists confer distinct pharmacological properties, including side effect profiles, mechanisms of action, and theoretical beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease expression.

Non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure was measured for 36 h at baseline and after 8 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the change in mean diastolic and systolic ambulatory blood pressure 22-24 h after dosing.; There was a significant difference in the adjusted mean difference for change from baseline to week 8 between candesartan cilexetil and enalapril at 22-24 h post-dose of -3.5 mmHg (95% confidence interval, CI: -6.8 to -0, 3 mmHg; p<0.032) for ambulatory systolic blood pressure and -3.0 mmHg (95% CI: -5.1 to -0.8 mmHg; p<0.008) for ambulatory diastolic blood pressure.

Both drugs were generally well tolerated.; The results of the present study suggest that advantages can be attributed to the use of candesartan cilexetil compared to enalapril in the treatment of patients with essential hypertension. Compared to enalapril 20 mg, candesartan cilexetil 16 mg was more effective in lowering blood pressure at trough levels and particularly on the day after the day after the last dose.",0,0
655,11333991,Lower response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in black patients compared to white patients with left ventricular dysfunction.,,"Exner, D V; Dries, D L; Domanski, M J; Cohn, J N","Black patients with heart failure have a poorer prognosis than white patients, a difference that has not been adequately explained. Whether racial differences in response to drug treatment contribute to differences in outcome is unclear. To address this issue, we pooled and analyzed data from the Prevention and Treatment of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) studies, two large, randomized studies that compared enalapril to placebo in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.; We used a matched-cohort design, pairing up to four white patients with each black patient according to study, treatment assignment, gender, left ventricular ejection fraction, and age. A total of 1196 white patients (580 from the prevention study and 616 from the treatment study) were matched with 800 black patients (404 from the prevention study and 396 from the treatment study). The mean length of follow-up was 35 months in the prevention study and 33 months in the treatment study.; The black patients and matched white patients had similar demographic and clinical characteristics, but the black patients had higher rates of death from any cause (12.2 vs. 9.7 per 100 person-years) and heart failure hospitalizations (13.2 vs. 7.7 per 100 person-years). Despite similar drug doses in the two groups, enalapril therapy was associated with a 44 percent reduction (95 percent confidence interval, 27 to 57%) in the risk of heart failure hospitalization in the white patients compared to placebo (P<0.001), but with no significant reduction in black patients (P=0.74). After one year, therapy with enalapril was associated with a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (by a mean [+/-SD] of 5.0 +/- 17.1 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (3.6 +/- 10 .6 mm Hg) compared to baseline. in the white patients but not in the black patients. No significant change in the risk of death associated with therapy with enalapril was observed in either group. Enalapril therapy is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of heart failure hospitalization in white patients with left ventricular dysfunction, but not in similar black patients. This finding underscores the need for further research into the effectiveness of therapies for heart failure in black patients.",0,0

Sixty patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive delapril 30 mg/day or manidipine 10 mg/day for 48 weeks in an open-label design. Twenty-eight out of thirty subjects in the delapril group and twenty-nine out of thirty in the manidipin group completed the study. Urinary albumin excretion, measured by urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, decreased significantly in both groups (112.0 +/- 60.9 to 95.3 +/- 64.9 mg/g and 108.5 + /- 51.0 to 96.4 +/- 53.5 mg/g in the delapril and manidipine groups, p<0.05, by paired t-test). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly changed after treatment in the delapril group, but decreased significantly in the manidipine group (130.9 +/- 7.1/80.2 +/- 6.1 to 127.2 +/- 7.1/78.0 +/- 5.3 mm/Hg, p<0.05, student's paired t-test). After 48 weeks of treatment, two patients in the delapril group and one patient in the manidipine group developed normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g) and one patient in each group developed overt nephropathy ( albumin:creatinine ratio in urine). > 300 mg/g). After 48 weeks of treatment, there were no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, serum fructosamine, creatinine, potassium and lipid profiles in either group. Two cases in the delapril group were withdrawn during the study because of an intolerable cough and one case in the manidipine group because of intolerable dizziness and headache. In conclusion, both delapril and manidipine are effective in reducing microalbuminuria in patients with normotensive type 2 diabetes and persistent microalbuminuria.",0,0

All patients with ISH were from a population screening program. Measurements of end-organ damage, taken at baseline and after 6 and 24 months of treatment, included measurements of aortic compliance and echocardiographic left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and diastolic function. Blood pressure was measured by ambulatory and ambulatory measurements. Of the 97 patients with ISH selected from the screening, 62 (30 lisinopril) completed the study according to the protocol. Office blood pressure decreased in both groups, but outpatient outcomes decreased significantly under lisinopril treatment. Aortic distensibility increased significantly with lisinopril, in contrast to a decrease in the placebo-treated subjects. The main effect of increased compliance occurred between 6 and 24 months, while ambulatory blood pressure changed mainly in the first 6 months of treatment. LVMI decreased in both treatment groups, with a significantly greater reduction in the lisinopril-treated patients. Left ventricular diastolic function showed no significant changes in either group. The vascular pathophysiological changes of ISH - a reduced distensibility of the aorta - can be improved by long-term treatment with lisinopril, while the values in patients treated with placebo continue to deteriorate. These results, from one of the first studies involving only patients with previously untreated ISH, indicate that treatment with lisinopril may have a beneficial effect on the cardiovascular risk of ISH.",0,0
658,11336577,Amlodipine/benazepril: fixed-dose combination therapy for hypertension.,,"Faulkner, M A; Hilleman, D E","Myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and end-stage renal disease have all been associated with inadequate blood pressure control. Despite overwhelming evidence that uncontrolled hypertension is responsible for a significant number of adverse health outcomes, control of the disease remains significantly suboptimal. Available data show that a large number of patients require therapy with more than one drug to achieve adequate blood pressure control. Fixed-dose antihypertensive combination therapy has many advantages over other treatment options. Positive effects on blood pressure control, adherence rates, side effects, and costs were noted. Amlodipine/benazepril (Lotrel, Novartis) is a fixed-dose combination product indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Although not currently recommended as first-line therapy, studies confirm that this combination of a long-acting calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has significant antihypertensive properties. While adverse reactions tend to increase with increasing doses of antihypertensive monotherapy, the incidence of adverse reactions attributed to amlodipine/benazepril in clinical trials often correlates with the incidence attributed to placebo. Amlodipine/Benazepril is able to maintain blood pressure control over a 24-hour period and appears to be minimally affected by occasional dose omission. Unlike the older calcium channel blockers, amlodipine is unlikely to cause changes in myocardial contractility. In addition, the amlodipine/benazepril combination product costs less than the same therapy administered as the individual components. It is therefore reasonable to consider therapy with amlodipine/benazepril in eligible patients after an appropriate trial of antihypertensive monotherapy.",0,0
659,11336618,The current state of antihypertensive treatments: into the new millennium.,,"Hardman, T C; Lunnon, M W","In this brief overview, we present a historical perspective on the treatment of hypertension, highlight some current issues, and look to the possible future of antihypertensive therapy. The distribution of blood pressure within the population assumes a continuous if somewhat skewed distribution, so what constitutes hypertension? Traditionally, the disease was defined as a blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg. Acceptance of this “arbitrary” definition suggests that about a quarter of the US adult population is hypertensive [1]. This has significant implications for public health impacts. We know that treating high blood pressure can prevent the serious consequences of cardiovascular disease: stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure and kidney disease. Therefore, it is important that elevated blood pressure is both recognized and effectively reduced. To what level should blood pressure be reduced? Traditionally, a value of 120/80 mmHg has been used to define normotonia, but there is evidence that this should not be the goal in certain circumstances. The question also arises as to whether it matters how the blood pressure is treated. Ultimately, the choice of remedy may depend on the presence of concomitant diseases and risk factors. Recent study results have shown that the therapy selected for the treatment of elevated blood pressure should take into account the patient's overall cardiovascular risk profile [2].",0,0

A current perspective on the proposed dangers.,,"Kizer, J R; Kimmel, S E","With increasing popularity, post-marketing studies of calcium channel blockers have indicated an increase in a variety of important adverse outcomes. However, the evidence was largely observational and large-scale studies capable of addressing the concerns were lacking. Clinical trials are now demonstrating the safety and efficacy of long-acting dihydropyridines for patients with uncomplicated and diabetic hypertension, although conventional therapies, and in the latter case angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, have superior evidence of benefit. On the other hand, short-acting dihydropyridines should be avoided. In acute coronary syndrome, beta-blockers remain the therapy of choice; the evidence for non-dihydropyridines remains inconclusive. Stable angina requires beta-blockers as first-line therapy and nondihydropyridines as second-line therapy, while safety data for nondihydropyridines in ventricular dysfunction are lacking. Initial reports of cancer, hemorrhage, and suicide have been contradicted by later data, making the associations uncertain or unlikely. Remaining questions await the completion of ongoing studies to better define the indications for these agents.",0,0

667,11368252,Treatment of high blood pressure in women of childbearing age and during pregnancy.,,"Magee, L A","High blood pressure occurs in 1 to 6% of young women. Treatment aims to reduce cardiovascular risk, the magnitude of which depends less on absolute blood pressure (BP) than on associated cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension-related target organ damage, and/or comorbidities. Lifestyle changes are recommended for all hypertensive patients. The blood pressure threshold at which antihypertensive therapy should be initiated is based on absolute cardiovascular risk. Most young women are at low risk and do not need antihypertensive therapy. All antihypertensive drugs appear to be equally effective; The choice depends on personal preference, social circumstances, and an agent's effect on cardiovascular risk factors, target organ damage, and/or comorbidities. Although most of the active ingredients are suitable for young women and are well tolerated by them, another consideration remains that of pregnancy, 50% of which is unplanned. A clinician must be aware of a woman's birth control method and the potential of an antihypertensive agent to cause birth defects after accidental exposure in early pregnancy. Conversely, if an oral contraceptive is effective and well tolerated, but the woman's blood pressure is mildly elevated, continuing the contraceptive and initiating antihypertensive therapy may not be contraindicated, particularly when the ability to plan pregnancy is important (e.g., e.g. in type 1 diabetes mellitus). No commonly used antihypertensive drug is known to be teratogenic, although ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists should be discontinued and all antihypertensive drugs should be continued during pregnancy only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential reproductive risk. Hypertensive pregnancy disorders complicate 5 to 10% of pregnancies and are a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Treatment aims to improve pregnancy outcome. There is consensus that severe maternal hypertension (systolic blood pressure > or = 170 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure > or = 110 mm Hg) should be treated promptly to avoid maternal stroke, death and possible eclampsia. Parenterally administered hydralazine may be associated with a higher risk of maternal hypotension and intravenous labetalol with neonatal bradycardia. There is no consensus on whether mild to moderate hypertension should be treated in pregnancy: risks of transient severe hypertension, antenatal hospitalization, proteinuria at delivery, and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome may be reduced by therapy, but this too Intrauterine fetal growth may be impaired, particularly by atenolol. Methyldopa and other beta-blockers have been used most commonly.

Each period lasted a month with a two-week washout between periods. In one period, patients received lisinopril 40 mg qd along with another antihypertensive therapy, and in the other, losartan 50 mg qd was added to the aforementioned regimen. Hemodynamic measurements included ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABP; Spacelabs 90207), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with iothalamate clearance, and cardiac output by acetylene-helium rebreathing technique. Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone and 24-hour urine protein were measured in all patients.; Twelve patients had diabetic nephropathy and four had chronic glomerulonephritis. The mean age (+/- SD) was 53 +/- 9 years. Body mass index was 38 +/- 5.7 kg/m2(2) and all but two patients were male. Seated cuff pressure was 156 +/- 18/88 +/- 12 mm Hg. Pulse rate was 77 +/- 11 per minute and cardiac index was 2.9 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2. 24 hour log mean protein clearance/g creatinine or total ABPs did not change. The placebo-subtracted mean change in protein excretion attributable to losartan was +1% (95% CI, -20% to 28%, p=0.89). Similarly, the change in systolic ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) was 4.6 mm Hg (-5.7 to 14.9, P=0.95) and diastolic ABP was 1.5 mm Hg (-4.5 to 7 .6, P=0.59). No change was noted in cardiac output. However, there was a mean 14% increase in GFR (95% CI, 3 to 26%, p=0.017) attributable to losartan therapy. A concomitant 32% decrease in plasma renin activity was observed (95% CI, -15%, -45%, p=0.002). No hyperkalemia, hypotension or acute renal failure occurred in the study. These results were not attributable to sequelae or carryover effects.; Losartan add-on therapy did not improve proteinuria or arterial blood pressure over one month of add-on therapy. The improvement in GFR and the decrease in plasma renin activity suggest that renal hemodynamic and endocrine changes are more sensitive measures of AT1 receptor blockade. Whether additional blockade of the AT1 receptor causes antiproteinuric effects or long-term renal protection requires larger and longer prospective, randomized, controlled trials.",0,0

A 54-year-old woman presented with a history of acute pulmonary edema with intractable hypertension and a history of claudication of the lower extremities. The addition of lisinopril to her antihypertensive regimen resulted in the development of acute renal failure within 48 hours, which resolved upon discontinuation of the drug. She was found to have a severely calcified occlusion of her aortic arch and another occlusion of the aorta below the renal arteries. Angiography and Doppler sonography showed normal renal arteries.

673,11383751,Pharmacoeconomics of hypertension management: the site of combination therapy.,,"Ambrosioni, E","Pharmacological treatment of hypertension has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke, coronary artery events, heart failure and kidney disease progression. However, rates of successful blood pressure control in treated patients remain low, while antihypertensive drugs account for a large and growing share of healthcare expenditure in many countries. Several influential pharmacoeconomic analyzes have confirmed the cost-effectiveness of conventional antihypertensive treatments, usually monotherapy with diuretics or beta-blockers, compared to alternative strategies. Recent research has shown that factors such as poor blood pressure control, poor adherence to therapy, discontinuation and switching between therapies account for a significant proportion of the total cost of antihypertensive treatment in general practice. These factors play a much smaller role in well-conducted clinical trials and have not been fully considered in most economic studies. Some novel strategies, particularly low-dose combinations of antihypertensive drugs, may offer benefits in terms of efficacy, reduced side effects, and improved adherence. Comprehensive pharmacoeconomic analyzes of novel strategies that take these additional factors into account are therefore required. Until such studies are available, the wider use of low-dose combination therapies and other novel strategies should not be held back based on previous economic studies that have not included all relevant considerations.",0,0

Thirty patients were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive a single dose of either FOS 10 mg, CAP 6.25 mg, or placebo. CAP resulted in a significant early and brief fall in blood pressure, while the hypotensive response to the first dose with FOS was not significantly different from placebo. Baseline plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was similar in all groups. Only CAP showed an acute and significant decrease in plasma ACE activity, while FOS and placebo did not alter ACE activity. There was no correlation between mean arterial pressure or percent change in mean arterial pressure and plasma ACE activity. Also, no correlation was found between high or low ACE activity levels and first-dose hypotension. The practical significance of the results are: For patients with congestive heart failure. FOS and CAP have different effects on blood pressure after the first dose and this effect may depend on the plasma ACE activity level. FOS produces ACE inhibition and BP changes similar to placebo, making it the safer choice for treating congestive heart failure.",0,0

In patients suspected of having CHF (by a standardized algorithm, based on World Health Organization guidelines), further examinations and primary care physician diagnoses were recorded.; 80 consecutive patients were assessed by each of 341 general practitioners across Australia, reflecting the mix of Australia's urban/rural population in 1996. This resulted in a total of 22060 evaluable patients.; Estimated number of patients with CHF in general practice (previously and newly diagnosed); important etiological factors; use of additional diagnostic tests; Medication prescribed.; CHF was diagnosed in 2905 of 22060 patients (13.2%) (2485 previously diagnosed and 420 newly diagnosed). Important etiological factors were ischemic heart disease and hypertension. Echocardiography had been performed in 64% of previously diagnosed patients but was performed in only 22% of possible CHF patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were prescribed for 58.1% of patients with CHF. Patients with evidence of left ventricular dysfunction were more likely to have received ACE inhibitors. CHF appears to be very common in the elderly based on the GP diagnosis of the condition.

Treatment with an ACE inhibitor has been shown to be superior to conventional antihypertensive treatment, but it is not known how an ACE inhibitor compares to treatment with a calcium channel blocker or a combination of these drugs. The aim of the study was to evaluate the rate of decrease in GFR in patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension treated with isradipine and spirapril as monotherapy and in combination.; Sixty patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension were included in the study. After admission, patients were followed prospectively in the outpatient clinic for 6 months with their usual antihypertensive medication and then randomized to a double-blind comparison of either spirapril 6 mg daily, isradipine 5 mg daily, or spirapril 3 mg daily and isradipine 2.5 mg daily. After randomization, patients were followed for 21 months or until dialysis was required. Every 3 months before and 3.5 months after randomization, the glomerular filtration rate was measured by 51Cr-EDTA clearance and the effective renal plasma flow was assessed by renal clearance of para-aminohippuric acid.; Blood pressure and decreases in glomerular filtration rate did not differ between groups before randomization. After randomization, the mean decrease in glomerular filtration rate was -0.32 mL/(min x month x 1.73 m2) in the spirapril group, -0.58 mL/(min x month x 1.73 m2) in the isradipine group and -0.14 ml/ (min x month x 1.73 m2) in the combination group (p = 0.38).

679,11395222,Benefits of antihypertensive drug treatment in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension.,,"Wang, J G; Staessen, J A","Isolated systolic hypertension affects over 15% of people over the age of 60. In the elderly, systolic hypertension is an important modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Systolic blood pressure is associated with a higher risk of an adverse outcome, while diastolic blood pressure is inversely correlated with all-cause mortality independent of systolic blood pressure, underscoring the role of pulse pressure as a risk factor. Three placebo-controlled outcome studies of antihypertensive drug treatment in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension have been published: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP), the Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) Trial, and the Systolic Hypertension in China (Syst- China) attempt. These three studies demonstrated the benefit of antihypertensive drug treatment. A meta-analysis was performed by pooling patients from these three studies with a subset of patients with isolated systolic hypertension from five other studies in elderly patients. Calcium channel blocker-based antihypertensive treatment may have additional benefits in diabetics and in the prevention of dementia and renal dysfunction. The pooled results from 15693 elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension demonstrate that antihypertensive drug treatment is warranted when systolic blood pressure is 160 mmHg or greater on repeated clinical measurements.",0,0

Perindopril 4 to 8 mg once daily significantly reduces supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline in hypertensive patients. These reductions are sustained for at least 24 hours as evidenced by valley to peak ratios of >50%. Vascular abnormalities associated with hypertension were improved or normalized during treatment with perindopril. Perindopril 4 to 8 mg once daily significantly reduced carotid-femoral aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), improved arterial compliance, reduced left ventricular mass index, and preserved cerebral blood flow in patients with recent cerebral ischemia and/or stroke despite significant reductions in SBP and DBP. More research is needed to substantiate the importance of promising results showing that a reduction in aortic PWV was associated with reduced mortality in patients with end-stage renal failure, a third of whom received perindopril. Response rates (number of patients with supine DBP < or = 90 mm Hg) were significantly higher with perindopril 4 to 8 mg once daily (67 to 80%) than with captopril 25 to 50 mg twice daily (44 to 57%) in 3 patients %). randomized double-blind studies. In other clinical studies, the blood pressure lowering effects of perindopril were similar to those of other ACE inhibitors (including enalapril) and calcium channel antagonists. Combination treatment with perindopril and an antihypertensive drug from a different treatment class provided additional benefits, either as first-line treatment or in patients who failed to respond to monotherapy. Perindopril monotherapy was also effective in elderly patients and in patients with hypertension and comorbidities. Perindopril has a similar side effect profile to other ACE inhibitors; Cough is the most commonly reported event during treatment and is also the most common adverse reaction responsible for treatment discontinuation. Perindopril is a well-tolerated ACE inhibitor that is significantly better than captopril (in terms of response rates) and as effective as other ACE inhibitors in treating hypertension. Perindopril appears to reverse some of the vascular abnormalities associated with hypertension, including arterial stiffness and left ventricular hypertrophy, although more research is needed to confirm promising results regarding its ability to reduce associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Results from ongoing studies will help confirm the value of perindopril in the treatment of hypertension; Currently, it is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.",0,0

686,11410114,Lisinopril improves endothelial function in chronic cigarette smokers.,,"Butler, R; Morris, A D; Struthers, A D","Cigarette smoking is a deleterious risk factor in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease, and endothelial dysfunction is an important antecedent event in this process. This is important because cigarette smoke is directly toxic to endothelial cells. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to improve endothelial function in diabetes and hypercholesterolemia and are a promising option in smokers. We treated 23 subjects (age 38 +/- 12 years; mean +/- SD) with lisinopril 20 mg for 8 weeks in a randomized controlled trial. Endothelial function was determined by measuring forearm perfusion responses to intra-arterial infusions of endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilators and an endothelium-dependent vasoconstrictor [acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, and monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), respectively] using venous occlusion plethysmography. Lisinopril significantly increased the forearm perfusion response to acetylcholine by 20% [lisinopril, 3.12 +/- 0.37 (mean +/- SEM); placebo, 2.58 +/- 0.25; P=0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09, 1.06] (values given are ratios of flow in the infused arm to that in the control arm); there was no effect on response to sodium nitroprusside (lisinopril, 3.97 +/- 0.40; placebo, 3.92 +/- 0.39; p=0.84; 95% CI -0.50, 0, 61).

Taken together, these results indicate that ACE inhibition can improve endothelial function in cigarette smokers. We show that lisinopril enhances both receptor-mediated and tonic NO release. The mechanism could be either that lisinopril limits angiotensin II-induced production of superoxide radicals that would normally inactivate NO, or that lisinopril can increase bradykinin-mediated NO release.",0,0

The study population was 52% female and 16% African American with a median age of 58 years. It included 5,446 patients with essential hypertension (HBP) and 1,014 patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). These patients had either uncontrolled or uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 140 to 179 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 90 to 109 mm Hg inclusive at baseline) despite a variety of antihypertensive drugs including diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and alpha or beta blockers, either alone or in combination. The mean baseline blood pressure for the HBP group was 156/97 mmHg. Candesartan cilexetil as monotherapy (in 51% of HBP patients) reduced the mean SBP/DBP by 18.7/13.1 mm Hg. As add-on therapy (in 49% of HBP patients) to various background therapies, candesartan cilexetil reduced the mean independently from background therapy consistently continued the mean SBP/DBP: diuretics (17.8/11.3 mm Hg), calcium channel blockers (16.6/11.2 mm Hg). Beta blockers (16.5/10.4 mm Hg), ACE inhibitors (15.3/10.0 mm Hg), alpha blockers (16.4/10.4 mm Hg). The mean baseline blood pressure for the ISH group was 158/81 mmHg. Candesartan cilexetil reduced SBP/DBP by 17.0/4.4 mmHg as monotherapy (in 34% of ISH patients). As add-on therapy (in 66% of ISH patients) to various background therapies, candesartan cilexetil consistently further reduced mean SBP/DBP regardless of background therapy: diuretics (17.4/5.1 mm Hg), calcium channel blockers (15.6/3.6 mmHg).

689,11413935,Efficacy and safety of angiotensin II receptor blockers in elderly patients with mild to moderate hypertension.,,"Okereke, C E; Messerli, F H","The role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the pathogenesis of hypertensive disorders has long been recognized, and disrupting this cascade with angiotensin converting enzyme I has been shown to be beneficial in the management of hypertension. Recently, a new class of drugs, the angiotensin receptor blockers, has emerged, adding to the antihypertensive drug arsenal. Because elderly patients are more prone to adverse drug reactions, in this article we review several studies, most of which were short-lived, on the efficacy and safety of angiotensin receptor blockers in the geriatric population with mild to moderate hypertension. These studies found the drugs to be well tolerated, safe, and in most cases as effective as other classes of antihypertensive drugs. Combination therapy with angiotensin receptor blockers and hydrochlorothiazide was additive with no significant impact on the safety profile.",0,0

Two weeks after randomization, patients doubled their respective doses of their angiotensin receptor blockers for an additional 6 weeks. At week 8, candesartan cilexetil reduced trough systolic/diastolic blood pressure significantly more than losartan (13.3/10.9 mmHg with candesartan cilexetil vs. 9.8/8.7 mmHg with losartan; p<0.001). Candesartan cilexetil also reduced peak blood pressure significantly more than losartan over the same period (15.2 to 11.6 mmHg with candesartan cilexetil vs. 12.6 to 10.1 mmHg with losartan; p<0.05). There were statistically significantly (p<0.05) higher proportions of responders and controlled patients in the candesartan cilexetil group (62.4% and 56.0%, respectively) than in the losartan group (54.0% and 46.9%). Both treatment regimens were well tolerated; 1.8% in the candesartan-cilexetil group and 1.6% in the losartan group discontinued treatment due to side effects. In summary, this accelerated titration study confirms that candesartan cilexetil is more effective than losartan in lowering blood pressure when both are administered at maximum doses once daily. Both drugs were well tolerated. (c) 2001 by Le Jacq.",0,0
691,11416681,Selection of initial antihypertensive drug therapy for the patient with uncomplicated hypertension.,,"Moore, M A","The choice of the initial antihypertensive drug for the uncomplicated hypertensive patient is an important and frequent occurrence for the general practitioner. Patients' initial experiences with antihypertensive drug therapy are likely to influence their long-term perceptions of hypertension management. The choice should be made on the basis of solid scientific evidence and the patient's perspective and needs. The drug should be taken once a day, have proven efficacy in controlling hypertension and reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and have as few side effects as possible. Low-dose thiazide diuretics fit this description, although less than ideal due to the need to monitor electrolytes. The class of angiotensin II receptor antagonists with placebo-like side effects in controlled trials is the most attractive from a patient perspective, although study results demonstrating that treatment of hypertension with angiotensin II receptor antagonists reduces cardiovascular events are not yet available. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, with their low side-effect profiles and unique effects on vascular remodeling, are an attractive second choice to combine with a diuretic when needed, although low-dose diuretics/beta-blockers also exist -Given combinations have been shown to lower blood pressure with minimal side effects. At present, ensuring adequate long-term hypertension control is the most important aspect of hypertension treatment, and which antihypertensive drugs the physician selects can greatly affect the hypertensive patient's ability to achieve and maintain long-term blood pressure control.

Non-responders (those who did not have diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg or had a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more from baseline) received valsartan 160 mg qd for an additional 4 weeks. In selected centers, the blood pressure was also monitored for 24 h in consenting patients, provided that the blood pressure was demonstrably under control. Of these patients, half missed a valsartan dose and were monitored for an additional 24 hours. The response rate to valsartan 80 mg was 45.4% and of those who did not respond to this dose, 36.3% responded to valsartan 160 mg. The response rate to either dose was 63.2%. Ambulatory blood pressure data support consistent blood pressure reduction with valsartan through 24 hours and up to 32 hours after dosing in dose-missing patients. The overall incidence of adverse events per person-year, treatment-related or otherwise, was 6.3 and 10.6 for the valsartan and placebo study periods, respectively.; Antihypertensive treatment with valsartan for 8 weeks resulted in a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients.

700,11434450,Monotherapy versus combination therapy as first-line treatment for uncomplicated arterial hypertension.,,"Ruzicka, M; Leenen, F H","Mild to moderate hypertension is still poorly controlled. This is related to several factors, including the low antihypertensive efficacy of individual drug therapies, primary care physicians' reluctance to modify/titrate the initially chosen therapy to achieve target BP, and poor medication compliance. Several guidelines for the management of hypertension now include low-dose 2-drug combination therapy as one of the strategies for the initial management of mild/moderate arterial hypertension. The evidence discussed in this article indicates superior blood pressure control by low-dose combinations of 2 drugs compared to regular-dose monotherapy. This superior efficacy of combination therapy relates to better antihypertensive efficacy and higher response rates in the low dose range as a result of complementary mechanisms of antihypertensive action, better tolerability as a result of lower side effect rate in the low dose range, improved compliance through better tolerability and simple drug regimen, and lower costs. Whether increased use of fixed low-dose combination therapies would result in better control of arterial hypertension in the population and thereby further reduction in cardiovascular/cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality from hypertension remains to be assessed.",0,0
701,11434453,barnidipine.,,"Malhotra, H S; Plosker, G L","Bamidipine is an antihypertensive drug that belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) group of calcium antagonists. It is available in a modified-release formulation that has a gradual onset of action and is effective in a single oral dose of 10 to 20 mg per day. Bamidipine has a selective action against cardiovascular calcium antagonist receptors and its antihypertensive action is related to the reduction in peripheral vascular resistance as a consequence of its vasodilator action. The clinical antihypertensive efficacy of barnidipine is similar to that of other DHP calcium antagonists such as nitrendipine and amlodipine and antihypertensive drugs belonging to other drug classes such as atenolol and enalapril. Barnidipine has been shown to be as effective and well tolerated as hydrochlorothiazide in treating high blood pressure in elderly patients. Barnidipine is generally well tolerated. As with other DHP calcium channel blockers, vasodilator side effects such as headache, flushing, and peripheral edema account for most of the side effects reported with its use and are usually transient.

A modeling approach based on a secondary analysis of published data was used and the costs corresponded to those incurred by the SHI service provider (ie SHI costs). In the base case analysis, average case-related GKV expenditures were applied and PYCDA was quantified using the cumulative ESRF incidence as observed in the REIN study.; The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of ramipril ranged from approximately -76,700 DM to -81,900 DM per PYCDA (1 DM is approximately US$0.55; 1999 values), corresponding to 1-year and 3-year treatment periods and In the sensitivity analysis, the robustness of the model and its results was shown when the extent of the influence of different model variables on the base case results was examined. First, the probabilities of ESRF and PYCDA were estimated using the Weibull method. Second, the influence of the model variables on the target variable was quantified using a deterministic model. Third, the dependency of the target variable (ICER) on random variables was described in a simulation. The cost of chronic dialysis had by far the greatest impact on the outcome measure, which was 28-fold greater than the impact of ramipril's clinical efficacy, ie, the number of PYCDA. Net savings per PYCDA with ramipril treatment after 1, 2 and 3 years: 95% of the 10,000 simulation steps resulted in savings between 69,500 DM and 94,600 D per PYCDA after 3 years; The results of this evaluation show that, from the point of view of the GKV in Germany, ramipril brings enormous savings as a supplement to the conventional treatment of patients with non-diabetic nephropathy and high blood pressure.",0,0

To investigate the effect of antihypertensive treatment on cardiac arrhythmias (CA) and transient episodes of myocardial ischemia (TEMI), we studied 46 hypertensive patients with LVH divided into four groups randomly treated with enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), atenolol, or verapamil ( SR-V) for 6 months. Office-based blood pressure and heart rate were recorded under baseline conditions after 1 and 6 months of treatment, and all patients underwent echocardiography, electrocardiographic Holter monitoring, and exercise stress testing. All drugs significantly lowered blood pressure, while left ventricular mass index was reduced by atenolol, enalapril, and SR-V but not by HCTZ. Treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the number of patients with supraventricular arrhythmias (35 v 15, P<0.034 and 28 v 8, excluding patients treated with HCTZ, P<0.008). The number of patients with ventricular arrhythmias was also reduced (32 v 16 considering all groups, P<0.08, and 24 v 9 excluding patients treated with HCTZ, P<0.04). The number of TEMIs during Holter monitoring decreased significantly from 47 to 23 (p=0.043) in all patients and from 39 to 14 (p=0.013) except in HCTZ-treated patients. Reductions in blood pressure, heart rate and the product of systolic blood pressure and heart rate as measured by an exercise test were observed in all groups, regardless of treatment. The present study shows that in hypertensive patients with LVH, antihypertensive treatment with atenolol, enalapril and SR-V reduces LVH and decreases the prevalence of CA and TEMI. Treatment with HCTZ during the 6-month study did not alter LVH and did not appear to reduce CA and TEMI.",0,0
714,11465651,Valsartan alone or with a diuretic or ACE inhibitor for the treatment of African American hypertensive patients: relationship to salt intake.,,"Weir, M R; Smith, D H; Neutel, J M; Bedigian, M P","Previous clinical studies have demonstrated the important influence of race and dietary salt content on the antihypertensive efficacy of drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are a new therapeutic substance that have not been extensively studied in African American hypertensive patients, either alone or in combination with other therapies such as diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. We conducted a prospective, open-label, pilot clinical study of randomized design to evaluate the effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan (160 mg once daily) on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive African American subjects (n = 88) at low salt levels (100 mEq Na+/day) for 2 weeks and the same diet supplemented with 100 mEq Na+ for 4 weeks. After this assessment, patients were randomized to receive valsartan 320 mg/day (n=28) or the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg/day (n=30) or benazepril 20 mg/day while maintaining Na+ supplementation the valsartan 160 mg/day for another 6 weeks. Valsartan (160 mg/day) reduced blood pressure in African-American patients on both a low-salt (-6.4/-4.8 mm Hg: P<0.001) and high-salt diet (-4.9/-3.8 mm Hg : P=0.001) significant. 01). The high-salt diet slightly attenuated the antihypertensive effect (1.6/1.3 mm Hg, P=not significant). When comparing the efficacy of the three randomized regimens during Na+ supplementation, valsartan 160 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg was the most effective therapy with incremental reductions in blood pressure of -10.5/-6.9 mm Hg (p<0.01 ). , compared to valsartan 160 mg/day alone. Doubling the valsartan dose to 320 mg progressively reduced blood pressure by -3.8/-3.3 mm Hg (p=not significant). The least effective approach was the addition of benazepril 20 mg/day to valsartan 160 mg/day with no incremental reduction in systolic blood pressure and a reduction in diastolic blood pressure of only 1.7 mm Hg (p=not significant). We conclude that in our open-label pilot study, the blood pressure lowering effect of valsartan in hypertensive African American subjects is not significantly attenuated by a salt-supplemented diet. Furthermore, the addition of a low dose of HCTZ appears to be the most effective strategy for increasing the blood pressure lowering activity of this angiotensin II receptor blocker, as opposed to either doubling the dose or adding an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.",0,0
715,11465654,Does the antihypertensive response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition predict the antihypertensive response to angiotensin receptor antagonism?,,"Stergiou, G S; Skeva, I I; Baibas, N M; Kalkana, C B; Roussias, L G; Mountokalakis, T D","To test the hypothesis that the antihypertensive response to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may predict the response to angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) antagonism, 33 hypertensive patients were randomized to to receive lisinopril (20 mg) or losartan (50 mg) 5 weeks. The patients were then switched to the alternative treatment for a second period of 5 weeks. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) was measured before randomization and on the last day of each period. The concordance of ABP response between the two drugs was assessed using the following approaches: Subjects were classified as responders and non-responders using an arbitrary response threshold (ABP drop > or = 10 mm Hg systolic or > or = 5 mm Hg diastolic) or the median ABP response achieved by each of the drugs. The discrepancy between the two drugs in the responder-nonresponder classification was expressed as the proportion of patients whose ABP responded to only one of the drugs. Lisinopril was more effective than losartan in lowering arterial blood pressure (mean difference 4.7 +/- 8.1/3.3 +/- 5.7 mm Hg, systolic/diastolic, p<0.05). Discrepancies in the antihypertensive response between the two drugs were detected in 39%/33% of subjects for systolic/diastolic ABP using the arbitrary response criterion (33%/39% using the median response criterion). Significant correlations were found between responses to lisinopril and losartan (r=0.47/0.59, systolic/diastolic, P<0.01). We conclude that in more than a third of hypertensive patients, the blood pressure response to ACE inhibition cannot predict the response to AT1R antagonism and vice versa. These data suggest that there are differences between these two drug classes that are not only of theoretical but also of practical importance.",0,0

Combination therapy aims to improve overall therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects. In well-designed, multi-centre clinical trials, perindopril/indapamide at doses ranging from 2/0.625 to 8/2.5 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving adequate blood pressure control. A similar reduction in blood pressure in the supine position was observed when the combination perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day was compared to losartan 50 mg/day or atenolol 50 mg/day. Similar reductions in ambulatory blood pressure over 24 hours were also observed with perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day and irbesartan 150 mg/day. However, the response and resolution rates were significantly higher with the combination therapy than with losartan or irbesartan monotherapy. Combination therapy with perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day reduced blood pressure effectively and significantly more than either atenolol 50 mg/day or placebo in elderly patients aged 65 to 85 years. In a small, non-comparative study with patients with high blood pressure and impaired kidney function, the blood pressure also normalized in about two thirds of the patients when they were lying on their back. Low-dose perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day was well tolerated in clinical studies; The most common side effects were headache and cough. Hypokalemia associated with the use of diuretics occurred at a higher incidence with perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day combined therapy than with either atenolol 50 mg/day or placebo. Perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day has been shown to be effective in well-designed comparative studies with atenolol, losartan and irbesartan in elderly patients and patients with renal impairment. Studies comparing this dosing of perindopril/indapamide to other combination therapies would be helpful in further determining the place of perindopril/indapamide. The low-dose fixed combination perindopril/indapamide offers a promising and well-tolerated treatment option for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension.",0,0
717,11468010,Role of bradykinin and tachykinins in the potentiation of citric acid-induced cough in pigs by enalapril.,,"Moreaux, B; Advenier, C; Gustin, P","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are among the first-line drugs used to treat high blood pressure and congestive heart disease. However, it has been reported that these drugs may induce chronic cough and airway hyperreactivity. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of bradykinin and tachykinins on citric acid-induced cough in pigs after ACE inhibitor pretreatment. Cough was induced by provocation of pigs with an aerosol of 0.8 M citric acid for 15 min. Coughs were counted by a trained observer over 30 minutes. The animals underwent two cough induction tests two days apart (days 1 and 3), the first serving as a control. All drugs were injected intravenously 30 minutes before the second challenge. In the control group, no difference was observed between day 1 and 3. The ACE inhibitor enalapril (7.5 and 15 micrograms/kg) led to a significant increase in cough frequency. In contrast, a dose-dependent decrease was observed for Hoe140 (icatibant), a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist (0.5 and 1 mg/kg). When both medicinal products were co-administered (15 micrograms/kg for enalapril and 1 mg/kg for Hoe140), a significant increase compared to the control value obtained on day 1 was observed. When enalapril was combined with the three tachykinin receptor antagonists SR 140333 (NK1 receptor antagonist), SR 48968 (NK2 receptor antagonist) and SR 142801 (NK3 receptor antagonist) compared to that received on day 1 control value observed a significant decrease; the percentage of variation was also significantly different compared to that observed in enalapril groups at both doses. These data suggest that the ACE inhibitor-induced enhancement of the cough reflex in our pig model is mainly due to tachykinins and not bradykinin. However, bradykinin plays an important role in cough induced by citric acid alone.",0,0

The World Health Organization also recently endorsed its use for this condition. Since AT1 receptor antagonists have proven to be on a par with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in terms of antihypertensive efficacy, but have better safety profiles, this class of drugs can be viewed as a qualitative improvement in the treatment of essential hypertension. Interestingly, the six drugs currently on the market differ significantly in terms of their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, although it is not certain whether these differences are clinically relevant. A significant number of large, multi-centre studies are underway to determine the possible longer-term organoprotective effects of these substances on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

For this reason there is considerable interest in the therapeutic potential of the natriuretic peptide system. Several approaches have been explored, including the use of native peptides, the development of natriuretic peptidomimetics, and targeting endogenous clearance of natriuretic peptides. While ANP and BNP administration may be valuable in some circumstances, the limitations of using peptides, particularly for long-term treatment, are evident. In view of this, considerable effort has been directed to the development of orally active agents for enhancing endogenous natriuretic peptides by inhibiting degradation by neutral endopeptidase. This research has now led to the vasopeptidase inhibitors - dual inhibitors of both endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme. These agents clearly offer a new approach to improving endogenous natriuretic peptide function against a background of reduced angiotensin II activity and may lead to an important advance in the treatment of hypertension and conditions associated with overt salt and water overload.",0,0

Case reports of adverse drug events (ADEs) published in Clin-Alert in 1977-97 were the source of information on drug-induced threats to life. Patient, drug, and event variables were identified, and the causality, predictability, and avoidability of each case were assessed. The data were entered into a relational database for analysis. The data showed 846 drug-induced life threats. 74 percent of the cases were classified as certain or probable. In 89% of cases, patients received usual or lower doses. The patients were usually middle-aged and only moderately ill. The drug categories most commonly associated with life threats were antimicrobials and central nervous system agents. Plasma level monitoring should have been performed in 127 cases but was performed in only 31 cases (24%). Event types were distributed as adverse drug reactions (50%), allergic reactions (35%), drug interactions (11%), and medication errors (4%). A commercial reference rated nearly half of life-threatening drug interactions as having minimal or no potential risk to the patient. Half of the life-threatening events were assessed as preventable; about half of these could have been prevented by a pharmacist. Litigation was reported in only 1% of drug-related life-threatening cases; Judgments and settlements averaged $1.2 million.

Case reports of ADEs published in Clin-Alert in 1976-97 were the source of information on ADEs, including drug-induced deaths, disabilities, and life threats. The results of the three studies were compared and recommendations were made. During the 21-year period, 1520 significant ADEs were reported (29% fatal, 15% permanent disability, and 56% life-threatening). Event types were distributed as adverse drug reactions (52%), allergic drug reactions (25%), medication errors (15%), and drug interactions (8%). Only 12% of drug-drug interactions were classified as highly significant by a drug information reference, while 32% of drug-drug interactions were unclassified. Typically, patients were 40-69 years old, relatively healthy or only moderately ill and had received usual doses. However, 29% of patients with drug-induced permanent disability were younger than 10 years. Only 17% of drugs that could have been monitored by blood level testing were so monitored. The drug categories most commonly implicated in ADEs were central nervous system agents, antimicrobial agents, antineoplastic agents, and cardiovascular agents. The nervous, hematopoietic, cardiovascular and respiratory systems were most affected. Incorrect prescribing was the most common reason for medication errors, and incorrect dosing was the most common type of error. A lawsuit was reported in 13% of cases. Overall, 52% of cases were judged preventable; 50% of these could have been prevented by a pharmacist. Litigation was reported in 13% of cases; Settlements and judgments averaged $3.1 million.

They also exhibit unique cardioprotective and renoprotective properties in patients with comorbid conditions such as heart failure and proteinuria or renal failure. This benefit is most clearly observed in diabetics. Although inconclusive, the results of a limited number of clinical trials support that in some patients additional antihypertensive, cardioprotective and renoprotective effects may be obtained from the combined use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 antagonists can be achieved.

733,11497198,Effects of ACE inhibitor therapy on derived central arterial waveforms in hypertension.,,"Dart, A M; Reid, C M; McGrath, B","The properties of large arteries form an important component of left ventricular afterload in hypertension. The present study investigated whether such properties were particularly responsive to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. A prospective, randomized, 12-week study in 138 previously treated hypertensive patients, 67 of whom had perindopril (P) therapy substituted for their usual care (UC). Characteristics of large arteries were evaluated as central arterial pressure increase determined by radial artery applanation tonometry and a transfer function. At baseline, both augmentation index (AI, %) and pressure (AP, mm Hg) were related to height, heart rate, and gender. In addition, AP was related to age and systolic blood pressure (BP). After 12 weeks of treatment, AP decreased significantly in both the perindopril and UC groups, while AI decreased significantly only in the perindopril treated groups (151.7% +/- 2.3% to 144.9% +/- 2.6%). Decreases in AP (-4.2 +/- 0.9 mm Hg vs -1.9 +/- 0.7 mm Hg) and AI (-6.8% +/- 2.2% vs -2 .2% +/- 2.5%) from week 0 to week 12 was greater in the perindopril-treated group, but the between-group differences did not reach statistical significance (p=0.05 and 0.09, respectively). The change in AI over the 12-week treatment period was dependent on baseline heart rate (p<0.001), systolic blood pressure (p<0.05), weight (p<0.001), and gender (p<0.001). , but not in the treatment group (P > 0.5). Al was negatively correlated with heart rate at 12 weeks, but the regression slopes for the association were virtually identical for the perindopril and UC groups. Treatment with perindopril results in a greater decrease in AI than continuation of previous therapy, but this is largely explained by hemodynamic changes rather than direct arterial effects.",0,0

735,11498653,Treatment of high-risk hypertensive patients and diabetes: possible role of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.,,"Weber, M A; Weir, M R","Uncontrolled high blood pressure leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Hypertensive patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes have an even higher risk of cardiovascular complications; Also, this high-risk patient population is at increased risk of kidney disease and ultimately kidney failure. Prospective morbidity and mortality studies have shown that strict blood pressure control improves cardiovascular prognosis and provides target organ protection. Current treatment guidelines recommend a target blood pressure of < 130/85 mm Hg for patients with hypertension and diabetes. Angiotensin II (A-II), a major component of the renin-angiotensin system, plays an essential role in the pathophysiology of hypertension and diabetic kidney disease. Currently, the treatment of choice for hypertensive patients with diabetes is angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, but most data are limited to patients with type 1 diabetes. Although ACE inhibition is clearly a mechanism to block A-II formation, inhibition may not be complete at this point since alternative pathways for A-II formation exist. Thus, A-II receptor antagonists for disrupting the renin-angiotensin system theoretically offer advantages over ACE inhibitors by directly inhibiting A-II through binding to the AT(1) receptor subtype. The objectives of this review are: 1) to provide an overview of the associated risk of cardiovascular complications in concomitant hypertension and diabetes; 2) demonstrate the cardiovascular benefit of effective blood pressure control in this patient population; 3) review of current treatment guidelines for the management of high-risk hypertensive patients; and 4) discuss large ongoing clinical trials of A-II receptor antagonists in patients with concomitant hypertension, type 2 diabetes and renal disease.

A 3-year interim analysis of the AASK showed a renoprotective effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril compared to the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (DHP-CCB) amlodipine in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. This differential effect was independent of the achieved blood pressure (BP) values and was evident in patients with proteinuria and suggested but inconclusive in patients with proteinuria < 300 mg/day at baseline. The AASK study data suggest that DHP-CCBs should be used with caution in the presence of mild to moderate renal impairment. The use of other CCBs such as verapamil or diltiazem should be subject to judgment as they are fundamentally different CCBs with the potential for different effects on hypertensive nephrosclerosis. The blinded follow-up phase for AASK will be completed by the end of September 2001, by which time additional clinically useful information is expected to become available.

The formation of NO, a pro-inflammatory substance on bronchial epithelial cells, is increased by ACEI. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we tested the hypothesis that supplementation with iron, an inhibitor of NO synthase, may reduce the cough associated with ACEI use. The subjects were 19 patients who had developed an ACEI-induced cough. After a 2-week observation period, they were randomized to a daily morning dose of either 256 mg ferrous sulfate tablets or placebo for a treatment period of 4 weeks. Subjects were asked to fill out a cough diary by rating the daily severity of the cough on a scale of 0 to 4. The mean daily cough scores for the last week of the observation and treatment period were compared. Changes in blood cell counts and serum iron and ferritin concentrations between the two periods were evaluated. Mean daily cough scores during the observation and treatment periods were 3.07 +/- 0.70 and 1.69 +/- 1.10 for the iron group, and 2.57 +/- 0.80 and 2.35+, respectively /- 1.22 for the placebo group, a significant reduction in cough scores with iron supplementation (P<0.01) but not with placebo. Three subjects in the iron group showed almost complete cessation of coughing. No significant changes in laboratory data were observed in either group. In conclusion, iron supplementation is successful in reducing ACEI-induced cough. This effect may be related to the decrease in NO production associated with inhibition of NO synthase activity in bronchial epithelial cells.",0,0

It is not known whether these changes are affected by clonidine. In 26 normotensive patients aged 58.0 +/- 1.1 years (mean +/- SEM) suffering from congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class II or III) and treated with furosemide and enalapril we measured mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and venous blood pressure in plasma norepinephrine and sympathetic muscle nerve trafficking (microneurography) at rest and during baroreceptor stimulation and deactivation induced by stepwise intravenous infusions of phenylephrine and nitroprusside, respectively. Measurements were repeated after 2 months of administration of clonidine transdermal patch (14 patients) or placebo (12 patients) according to a double-blind, randomized sequence. Clonidine caused a slight, non-significant reduction in mean arterial pressure and heart rate without affecting exercise capacity and left ventricular ejection fraction as determined by echocardiography. In contrast, both plasma norepinephrine and sympathetic nerve trafficking were significantly reduced (-46.8% and -26.7%, respectively; p<0.01 for both). This reduction was coupled with no change in cardiac and sympathetic baroreflex responses. The transdermal placebo administration over a period of 2 months did not affect any of the above variables. Thus, in patients with congestive heart failure undergoing conventional drug treatment, chronic clonidine administration exerts marked sympathoinhibitory effects without adversely affecting cardiac functions and clinical status. Whether this translates into additional therapeutic benefits remains to be tested.",0,0

747,11515986,Diabetics with hypertension not controlled with ACE inhibitors: alternative therapies.,,"Cleophas, T J; van Ouwerkerk, B M; van der Meulen, J; Zwinderman, A H","When hypertension is not adequately controlled by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a beta-blocker is often added as second-line therapy. Recently, large randomized trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of second-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in these patients. These compounds are increasingly being used as replacements for beta-blockers. Discontinuation of beta-blockers can affect diabetes control and cause rebound hypertension. Rebound hypertension from withdrawal of beta-blockers may not occur if the beta-blocker is replaced with a calcium channel blocker. A calcium channel blocker affects vascular resistance (VR) and blood pressure differently than a beta-blocker. Thirty-four patients with type II diabetes mellitus and resting diastolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg despite daily administration of enalapril 10 mg (or equipotent doses of other ACE-i) for at least 3 months were treated in an open-label sequential comparison with the same ACE-i in combination with the beta blocker metoprolol 100 mg for 3 months and then for 3 more months with the same ACE-i in combination with the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker lercanidipine 10 mg once daily. After 6 weeks, patients with diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg were uptitrated to metoprolol 200 mg or lercanidipine 20 mg once daily. Patients were monitored every 6 weeks during the study and after 2 weeks while on lercanidipine treatment. In addition to blood pressure measurements, VR was measured by iridium strain gauge plethysmography and expressed in units (1 unit = 1 mm Hg/ml blood/100 ml tissue per minute). Two of 34 patients did not complete the protocol due to non-compliance with lercanidipine treatment during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Your data is included in the analysis. No rebound hypertension was observed 14 days after switching therapies. (Mean arterial pressures [MAPs] were not significantly different by the time the beta-blockers were stopped.) Heart rate, however, increased from 69 +/- 7 to 94 +/- 10 beats/min (p<0.001). After 3 months on lercanidipine, MAP fell by 6 +/- 10 mm Hg compared to when the beta-blocker was stopped (p=0.002). Vascular resistance fell by 6.28 +/- 11.91 units (p < 0.01), while glucosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) increased by 0.4 +/- 0.5% (p < 0.001) and body weight by 0 .6 +/- 0.6 kg (p < 0.01) increased). Multiple regression analysis revealed significant associations between decreases in VR, increases in HbA1c and decreases in MAP, and partial interdependence of these variables. In hypertensive patients with type II diabetes, replacement of ACE-i and metoprolol with ACE-i and lercanidipine does not appreciably affect metabolic control and does not cause rebound hypertension. Lercanidipine was more effective than metoprolol as a second-line antihypertensive agent in these patients. At least two mechanisms may be involved: reversal of the pressor effect of the beta-blocker and calcium channel-mediated vasodilation.",0,0

The beneficial effect in slowing the progression of kidney disease is greater in patients with higher urinary protein excretion at the start of treatment. We hypothesized that the greater beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on renal disease progression in patients with higher baseline levels of proteinuria is due to their greater antiproteinuric effects in these patients.; Data from 1860 patients from 11 randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of antihypertensive regimens, including ACE inhibitors, versus regimens without ACE inhibitors on the progression of nondiabetic kidney disease were analyzed. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between baseline proteinuria levels and changes in urinary protein excretion during follow-up. Cox's proportional hazards analysis was used to assess the relationship between changes in urinary protein excretion during follow-up and the effect of ACE inhibitors on the time to doubling of baseline serum creatinine or the onset of end-stage renal disease judge.; The mean (median) baseline urinary protein excretion was 1.8 (0.94) g/day. Patients with higher urinary protein excretion levels at baseline had greater reductions in proteinuria during follow-up associated with ACE inhibitor treatment and associated with reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (interaction P<0.001 for all). Higher urinary protein excretion during follow-up (baseline minus change) was associated with a greater risk of progression [relative risk 5.56 (3.87 to 7.98) for each 1.0 g/day higher protein excretion]. After controlling for actual urinary protein excretion, the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors remained significant [the relative risk for ACE inhibitors versus control was 0.66 (0.52 to 0.83)], but there was no significant interaction between the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors and the baseline level of urinary protein excretion.; The antiproteinuric effects of ACE inhibitors and the reduction in blood pressure are greater in patients with higher baseline protein excretion. The greater beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on renal disease progression in patients with higher baseline proteinuria may be explained by their greater antiproteinuric effects in these patients. The current level of urinary protein excretion is a modifiable risk factor for the progression of nondiabetic kidney disease. ACE inhibitors provide a greater beneficial effect at all levels of current urinary protein excretion.",0,0
752,11532682,Plasma levels and metabolism of AcSDKP in patients with chronic renal failure: relationship to erythropoietin requirements.,,"Le Meur, Y; Lorgeot, V; Comte, L; Szelag, J C; Aldigier, J C; Leroux-Robert, C; Praloran, V","N-Acetyl-Seryl-Aspartyl-Lysyl-Proline (AcSDKP) is a physiological inhibitor of hematopoiesis that is maintained at stable levels in normal plasma. Its degradation in vivo and in vitro by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) explains the high plasma concentrations of AcSDKP in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. Because ACE inhibitors can induce anemia in some patients, we measured plasma AcSDKP concentrations in 176 chronic kidney disease patients: 120 hemodialysis (HD) and 56 non-dialysis (nD) patients, of whom 39 had ACE received inhibitors. We examined the relationships between AcSDKP levels, hematological parameters and recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) requirements in these patients. AcSDKP levels were significant in HD (10.3 +/- 3.9 pmol/mL) and nD (3.1 +/- 1.8 pmol/mL) patients not receiving ACE inhibitors higher than controls (1.8 +/- 0.2 pmol/ml). In all patients, treatment with ACE inhibitors significantly increased these values four-fold. HD sessions significantly decreased AcSDKP concentrations by 66% and reduced the in vitro half-life of AcSDKP before dialysis (270 +/- 109 minutes) to values (182 +/- 67 minutes) that are not significantly different from those of controls or nD patients. Most HD patients treated with ACE inhibitors had AcSDKP levels greater than 24 pmol/mL (the highest level found in other nD and HD patients). Only in this patient group did weekly doses of rHuEPO correlate with AcSDKP levels. Our results indicate that renal function is essential to maintain stable AcSDKP plasma levels, and at high levels AcSDKP acts as a uremic toxin causing partial resistance to erythropoietin and inhibiting erythropoiesis.",0,0

In hospitalized patients, the incidence of these reactions is between 1 and 3%. The frequency of skin reactions to certain drugs can exceed 10%. These reactions can range from mildly uncomfortable to life-threatening. Anti-infectives and anti-convulsants are among the drugs most commonly associated with skin side effects. We describe and illustrate the clinical morphology of the most common cutaneous drug reactions as well as drugs that most commonly elicit specific reactions. The varied nature of the reactions that occur, even with specific agents, points to a variety of available mechanisms by which cutaneous drug reactions can be initiated. Although a variety of terms have been proposed to categorize cutaneous drug reactions, we suggest that reactions are best defined on the basis of mechanisms, where known. In this review, we review the current knowledge on four categories of cutaneous drug reactions: immediate-type immune-mediated reactions, delayed-type immune-mediated reactions, photosensitivity reactions, and autoimmune syndromes. In addition, we describe evidence that viral infection is an important predisposing factor in the development of cutaneous drug reactions after drug administration. Finally, we review the current state of knowledge on the nature and mechanisms of cutaneous drug responses to several drug categories.",0,0

756,11548874,The renin-angiotensin system is involved in the mechanism of increased asymmetric serum dimethylarginine in essential hypertension.,,"Ito, A; Egashira, K; Narishige, T; Muramatsu, K; Takeshita, A","Endothelium-dependent/nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation is impaired in hypertensive individuals. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase, is synthesized by many cell types, including vascular endothelial cells. The serum level of ADMA is increased in patients with essential hypertension, but the mechanism for this increase is unknown. Therefore, the present study examined whether the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved. Patients with essential hypertension [systolic blood pressure (BP) > 160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP > 95 mmHg] were randomized to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment arm (perindopril, 4 mg/day for 4 weeks, n= 7), an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist treatment group (losartan, 50 mg/day for 4 weeks, n=7), or a beta-blocker treatment group (bisoprolol, 5 mg/day for 4 weeks, n=7). ). Before and after treatment, BP, serum concentration of ADMA and plasma concentration of von Willebrand factor (vWF, a biological marker of endothelial damage) were measured. Perindopril, losartan, and bisoprolol reduced blood pressure to a similar extent, and either perindopril or losartan, but not bisoprolol, significantly reduced serum ADMA and plasma vWF. These findings suggest that the RAS may contribute to the mechanism of increased serum ADMA and endothelial damage seen in hypertensive patients. The vasculoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors or AT1 receptor antagonists may be explained, at least in part, by amelioration of endothelial damage through a decrease in serum ADMA concentration.",0,0

This study was conducted in a crossover fashion after a 2-week placebo phase and 4 to 8 weeks of treatment with temocapril and amlodipine. Of these 59 hypertensive patients, three patients with side effects and 10 patients whose in-office blood pressure values did not reach the target blood pressure values were excluded, and the remaining 46 were analyzed in this study: they consisted of 30 dippers with a nocturnal decrease in systolic blood pressure ( SBP) > or = 10% and 16 non-dippers, with < 10% reduction. At baseline, there were no significant differences in office, 24-hour, or daytime blood pressure readings between the two groups (divers and non-porters). Although office and daytime blood pressures were successfully controlled to the same levels with both treatments and in both dipping groups, the antihypertensive effects with CCB were stronger than with the ACE inhibitor at night and in the morning, particularly in non-dippers. We conclude that although in-office blood pressure has been successfully controlled to almost the same levels, there is a possibility that these long-acting drugs may have differential antihypertensive effects on nocturnal and morning blood pressure in hypertensive patients with different nocturnal hypotensive states.",0,0

In this paper, the authors report a case of a patient with hypertension. On admission, the authors started antihypertensive therapy with captopril, which led to a significant increase in amylase and lipase within 13 days. After stopping ACE inhibitor therapy, a rapid decrease in serum enzymes was observed within 3 days. The high serum amylase and lipase levels were associated with neutrophilia but were not associated with relevant symptomatic findings or features of pancreatopathy. The absence of the usual conditions that can cause pancreatitis, such as B. biliary obstruction, hypercalcemia, or alcohol abuse, and the rapid fall in serum enzyme levels after drug discontinuation suggested ACE inhibitor-induced pancreatitis. This is the first clinical report of ACE inhibitor-induced pancreatitis involving post-hospital administration of captopril. The drug suspension likely prevented other complications. This case report suggests that when starting ACE inhibitor therapy, serum amylase and lipase should be monitored to prevent acute pancreatitis without waiting for clinical signs of pancreatopathy.",0,0

We determined whether the ACE inhibitor ramipril prevents the development and causes regression of ECG LVH and whether these changes are associated with an improved prognosis independent of blood pressure reduction.; In the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study, high-risk patients were randomized to ramipril or placebo and followed for 4.5 years. ECGs were recorded at baseline and at the end of the study. We compared prevention/regression and evolution/persistence of ECG-LVH in the two groups and related these changes to outcomes. At baseline, 676 patients had LVH (321 in the ramipril group and 355 in the placebo group) and 7605 patients had no LVH (3814 in the ramipril group and 3791 in the placebo group). At the end of the study, 336 patients in the ramipril group (8.1%) compared to 406 in the placebo group (9.8%) had development/persistence of LVH; in contrast, 3799 patients in the ramipril group (91.9%) versus 3740 patients in the placebo group (90.2%) experienced regression/prevention of LVH (p=0.007). The effect of ramipril on LVH was independent of changes in blood pressure.

Enalapril has been administered orally to children under 6 years of age as a novel preparation suspension and to older children as tablets. First-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics were determined in children aged 1 to 24 months, 25 months to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 16 years. Maximum serum concentrations for enalapril were reached approximately 1 hour after administration. The serum concentrations of enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril, peaked between 4 and 6 hours after the first dose and 3 and 4 hours after multiple doses. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) adjusted for body surface area did not differ between age groups. Based on a comparison of first-dose and steady-state AUCs, the accumulation of enalaprilat in children ranged from 1.13- to 1.45-fold. In children 2 to 15 years of age, the mean urinary recovery of total enalaprilat ranged from 58.3% in children 6 to <12 years of age to 71.4% in children 12 to <16 years of age. Urinary recovery for children aged 2 to < 6 years was 66.8%. The mean percent conversion of enalapril to enalaprilat ranged from 64.7% for children aged 1 to 24 months to 74.6% for children aged 6 to <12 years. The median effective half-life for accumulation ranged from 14.6 hours in children 12 to <16 years of age to 16.3 hours in children 6 to <12 years of age. There were two serious adverse events, none of which were attributed to enalapril or led to study drug discontinuation. The extemporaneous suspension used in this study was well tolerated.

We studied 89 hypertensive postmenopausal women (diastolic blood pressure > 90 and < 110 mm Hg) aged 51 to 60 years who were not receiving hormone replacement therapy. Diabetics, obese and smoking patients were excluded. After a 4-week placebo period, they were randomized to receive oral trandolapril 2 mg (n=45) or oral losartan 50 mg (n=44) for 12 weeks in a double-blind, parallel-group design. At the end of the placebo and active treatment periods, blood pressure (BP) was measured, plasma samples were taken to assess PAI-1 antigen levels, and insulin sensitivity was assessed. Both trandolapril and losartan reduced systolic blood pressure (by a mean of 16.9 mm Hg and 15.2 mm Hg, respectively, P < 0.01 v placebo) and diastolic BP (by a mean of 13.1 mm Hg and 11.9, respectively mm Hg, P < ). 01 vs placebo) with no difference between the two treatments. PAI-1 antigen levels were significantly reduced by trandolapril (from 36.9 +/- 21 ng/dl to 27.2 +/- 17 ng/dl, P<0.05) but not by losartan (from 35, 3 +/- 22ng/dl). dL to 37.1 +/- 23 ng/dL, P=not significant).

In the trandolapril group, the decrease in PAI-1 correlated with an increase in glucose infusion rate (r=0.36, P=0.045). These results provide evidence for differential effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 antagonists on fibrinolysis and suggest that the PAI-1 decreases induced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are related to their effect on insulin sensitivity and is not dependent on angiotensin II antagonism, but rather on other mechanisms. It remains to be seen whether these results apply to patient populations other than postmenopausal women.",0,0

To investigate these possibilities, we examined the common carotid arteries of 20 low-cholesterol subjects and 19 high-cholesterol subjects, all with essential hypertension, who happened to undergo 3 months of treatment with nitrendipine (20 mg/day) or trandolapril (2 mg /day) were allocated ). Carotid parameters were determined by recording instantaneous pressure (applanation tonometry) and diameter (echotracking device) and modeling the pressure-diameter loop to obtain Peterson's modulus, stiffness index, measured and isobaric compliances, and wall viscosity. The effects of drugs on carotid parameters did not differ, except for systolic and diastolic diameters (p<0.01), which increased marginally with nitrendipine but decreased with trandolapril (p<0.01). Blood cholesterol levels had no effect on the effects of trandolapril on the carotid artery, whereas low and high cholesterol patients treated with nitrendipine had significant differences in drug effects on (a) systolic and pulse pressures (p<0.05) , which decreased in patients with low cholesterol (p<0.01, p<0.05) but not in patients with high cholesterol; (b) diastolic diameter (p=0.05), which increased insignificantly in patients with low cholesterol but remained unchanged in patients with high cholesterol; and (c) wall viscosity (p<0.01), which decreased in low cholesterol patients (p<0.05) but increased negligibly in high cholesterol patients. The change in wall viscosity with nitrendipine was also positively related to baseline blood cholesterol (r=0.64, p<0.01). For example, nitrendipine and trandolapril show remarkable differences in their effects on the carotid artery, especially with regard to blood cholesterol levels, which should be confirmed by larger studies.",0,0

Patients were randomized to manidipine 10-20 mg or amlodipine 5-10 mg once daily for 48 weeks. Patients not responding to treatment after 12 weeks also received enalapril, 10-20 mg, for the duration of the study. The key efficacy endpoint was the equivalence of seated systolic (SiSBP) and diastolic (SiDBP) blood pressure reduction between the two drugs at 8 weeks (per protocol analysis). An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed on all patients with at least one on-treatment efficacy assessment. Quality of life was assessed after 12 weeks of treatment using the Subjective Symptoms Assessment Profile (SSA-P) and the General Well-being Schedule (GWBS). SiSBP reduction at 8 weeks was equivalent for manidipine (15.2 mm Hg, n=227) and amlodipine (17.0 mm Hg, n=219). The corresponding value for SiDBP was 11.3 mm Hg for manidipine and 12.3 mm Hg for amlodipine. In the larger ITT population, SiDBP was similarly and significantly reduced by manidipine (from 102 +/- 5 to 88 +/- 9 mm Hg, n = 241) and amlodipine (from 101 +/- 5 to 87 +/- 8 mm Hg) reduced , n = 240). Similar results were observed for SiSBP and standing SBP and DBP. Neither drug altered sitting or standing heart rate compared to baseline. SSA-P scores improved with manidipine but not with amlodipine. Total and partial GWBS scores increased more with manidipine than with amlodipine. The safety profile favored manidipine, which was associated with significantly less ankle edema than amlodipine. This study shows for the first time that long-term treatment with the long-acting calcium channel blocker manidipine is as effective as treatment with amlodipine, has a better tolerability profile and produces a greater improvement in quality of life than amlodipine.",0,0

However, in many of these patients there is uncertainty about the efficacy and safety of antihypertensive treatments. The Perindopril Study in Protection from Recurrent Stroke (PROGRESS) was designed to determine the effects of antihypertensive treatment in hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack.; 6105 subjects from 172 centers in Asia, Australasia and Europe were randomly assigned to active treatment (n=3051) or placebo (n=3054). Active treatment included a flexible regimen based on the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (4 mg daily) with the addition of the diuretic indapamide at the discretion of the treating physician. The primary endpoint was total stroke (fatal or non-fatal). The analysis was intended to treat.; Through 4 years of follow-up, active treatment reduced blood pressure by 9/4 mm Hg. 307 (10%) subjects assigned to active treatment experienced a stroke compared with 420 (14%) assigned to placebo ( relative risk reduction 28% [95% CI 17-38], p<0.0001). Active treatment also reduced the risk of major vascular events overall (26% [16-34]). There were similar reductions in stroke risk in hypertensive and non-hypertensive subgroups (all p<0.01). Combination therapy with perindopril plus indapamide reduced blood pressure by 12/5 mm Hg and the risk of stroke by 43% (30-54). Monotherapy reduced blood pressure by 5/3 mm Hg and resulted in no apparent reduction in stroke risk.; This antihypertensive regimen reduced the risk of stroke in both hypertensive and non-hypertensive subjects with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Combination therapy with perindopril and indapamide resulted in greater blood pressure reductions and greater risk reductions than perindopril monotherapy alone. Treatment with these two agents should now be routinely considered for patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, regardless of their blood pressure.",0,0

The purposes of the present study were: (1) to evaluate the effect of losartan on serum uric acid in hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia and gout, (2) the effects of losartan with those of irbesartan, another angiotensin II receptor antagonist, and (3) to assess whether losartan 50 mg twice daily has a greater effect on serum uric acid levels than losartan 50 mg once daily; Thirteen hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia and gout completed this prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Uric acid-lowering drugs were discontinued 3 weeks before the start of the study. Patients were randomized to receive either losartan 50 mg or irbesartan 150 mg once daily for 4 weeks. During this phase, a placebo was administered in the evening. After 4 weeks, the dose was increased to losartan 50 mg twice daily or irbesartan 150 mg twice daily for a further 4 weeks. The patients were then switched to the alternative treatment modality. Enalapril (20 mg once daily) was given during the run-in period and between the two treatment periods. Serum and uric acid were measured at the beginning and end of each treatment period.; Our results show that losartan 50 mg once daily reduced serum uric acid levels from 538 +/- 26 to 491 +/- 20 micromol/L (P<0.01). Irbesartan had no effect on serum uric acid. Increasing the dose of losartan from 50 mg once daily to 50 mg twice daily resulted in no further reduction in serum uric acid. This may be partly due to poor adherence to the evening dose measured with an electronic device. Regardless of the drug prescribed, the mean compliance of the evening dose was always significantly lower than that of the morning dose. The uricosuric effect of losartan appears to decrease over time when a new steady state of lower serum uric acid is reached. Unlike irbesartan, losartan was uricosuric and decreased serum uric acid levels. Losartan 50 mg twice daily did not produce a greater decrease in serum uric acid than losartan once daily. Losartan could be a useful therapeutic agent to control blood pressure and reduce serum uric acid levels in hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia and gout.",0,0

793,11607794,ACE inhibition in aortic stenosis: dangerous medicine or golden opportunity?,,"Routledge, H C; Townend, J N","Conventional angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with aortic stenosis. A large body of evidence is now available showing that angiotensin II plays a central role in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), myocardial contractility failure, and diastolic dysfunction in response to pressure overload. In animal models, ACE inhibitors have been shown to attenuate these pathological responses. There is no such evidence in humans, but uncontrolled studies have shown that these agents are not only tolerated, but are associated with acute improvements in hemodynamics and diastolic function. Further studies are warranted to assess the possible role of ACE inhibitors in aortic stenosis both before and after valve replacement. Potential benefits include prevention of LVH, improved diastolic function, reduction in arrhythmias, and preservation of left ventricular function.",0,0

Definitive diagnosis is made by renal angiography, an invasive and expensive procedure. The prevalence of renal artery stenosis is less than 1% in unselected hypertensive patients, but is higher when the hypertension is drug-resistant.; To study the utility of standardized two-drug regimens for identifying drug-resistant hypertension as a predictor of renal artery stenosis.; Prospective cohort study conducted in 26 hospitals in the Netherlands.; Patients were referred for analysis of possible secondary hypertension or for difficult-to-treat hypertension. Patients < or = 40 years were assigned either amlodipine 10 mg or enalapril 20 mg and patients > 40 years either amlodipine 10 mg combined with atenolol 50 mg or enalapril 20 mg combined with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Renal angiography was performed: (1) if the hypertension was drug-resistant, ie, if diastolic pressure remained > or = 95 mmHg at three visits 1–3 weeks apart or additional drug was required, and/or (2) if Serum creatinine increased by > or = 20 micromol/L (> or = 0.23 mg/dL) during treatment with ACE inhibitors; Of the 1106 patients with full follow-up, 1022 had been assigned to either the amlodipine- or enalapril-based regimen, 772 by randomization. Drug-resistant hypertension, as defined above, was found in 41% of patients, and 20% of them had renal artery stenosis. Renal impairment was observed in 8% of patients on ACE inhibitors and was associated with a 46% prevalence of renal artery stenosis. In the randomized patients, the prevalence of renal artery stenosis did not differ between the amlodipine- and enalapril-based regimens.; In the diagnostic clarification of renovascular hypertension, the use of standardized medication regimens of a maximum of two drugs to identify patients with drug-resistant hypertension is a useful first step to increase the a priori chance of renal artery stenosis. Amlodipine- or enalapril-based therapies are equally effective for this purpose.",0,0

Forty-eight people with hypertension took part in an experiment at home and at the doctor's office. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group assigned to owning pets in addition to lisinopril (20 mg/day) or to a control group receiving lisinopril alone (20 mg/day). On each study day, blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma renin activity were recorded at baseline and after each mental stressor (serial subtraction and language). Before drug therapy, the mean reactions to mental stress between the experimental and control groups did not differ significantly in terms of heart rate (94 [SD 6.8] versus 93 [6.8] bpm), systolic blood pressure (182 [8.0 ] versus 181 [8.3] mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (120 [6.6] versus 119 [7.9] mmHg), or plasma renin activity (9.4 [0.59] versus 9.3 [ 0.57] ng.mL(-1.h(-1)).Lisinopril therapy reduced resting blood pressure by approximately 35/20 mmHg in both groups, but the response to psychological stress was significantly lower in pet owners than in those who received only lisinopril (P<0.0001; heart rate 81 [6.3] versus 91 [6.5] bpm, systolic blood pressure 131 [6.8] versus 141 [7.8] mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 92 [6 .3] versus 100 [6.8] mm Hg and plasma renin activity 13.9 [0.92] versus 16.1 [0.58] ng.mL(-1).h(-1)).

Therapeutic studies based on cardiovascular mortality have recently shown that SBP reduction requires normalization of both large artery stiffness and wave reflections. The aim of the present study was to compare the antihypertensive effect of the very low-dose combination of indapamide (0.625 mg) and perindopril (2 mg) (Per/Ind) with the beta-blocker atenolol (50 mg) to determine whether Per/Ind decreases SBP and pulse pressure (PP) more than atenolol and if so, whether this decrease is predominantly due to reduction in aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) (automated measurements) and reduction in wave reflections (pulse wave analysis, applanation tonometry). In a double-blind, randomized study, 471 patients with essential hypertension were followed for 12 months. With the same DBP reduction, Per/Ind decreased brachial SBP (-6.02 mm Hg; 95% CI, -8.90 to -3.14) and PP (-5.57; 95% CI, -7 .70 to -3.44) was significantly stronger than atenolol. This difference was significantly more pronounced for the carotid artery than for the brachial artery. While the 2 antihypertensives reduced PWV to a similar extent, only Per/Ind significantly attenuated carotid wave reflections, resulting in selective reductions in SBP and PP. The very low dose Per/Ind combination normalizes SBP, PP and arterial function to a significantly greater extent than atenolol, a hemodynamic profile known to improve survival in hypertensive populations at high cardiovascular risk.",0,0

However, little is known about the comparative effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs on pulse pressure. In retrospective analyzes of the Veterans Affairs Single-Drug Therapy for Hypertension Study, we compared changes in pulse pressure with 6 classes of antihypertensive drugs: 1292 men with diastolic blood pressure 95 to 109 mm Hg on placebo were randomized to receive hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, prazosin, or placebo. Drug doses were titrated to achieve a target diastolic blood pressure of < 90 mm Hg during a 4- to 8-week medication period. The change in pulse pressure (subtracted from placebo) was assessed from baseline to the end of the 3-month titration and 1-year maintenance therapy. Mean systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures at baseline were 152, 99, and 53 mmHg, respectively. Reductions in pulse pressure during titration were greater (p<0.001) with clonidine (6.7 mm Hg) and hydrochlorothiazide (6.2 mm Hg) than with captopril (2.5 mm Hg), diltiazem (1.6 mm Hg) and atenolol (1.4 mm Hg). ; Reduction with prazosin (3.9 mm Hg) was similar to all except clonidine. At 1 year, pulse pressure was reduced significantly more (p<0.001) with hydrochlorothiazide (8.6 mm Hg) than with captopril and atenolol (4.1 mm Hg with both); Clonidine (6.3 mm Hg), diltiazem (5.5 mm Hg) and prazosin (5.0 mm Hg) were intermediate.

Preliminary evidence suggests that a decrease in blood pressure (BP) is associated with decreased wall thickness. It is not known whether all classes of antihypertensive drugs have similar protective effects. In this double-blind, parallel-group clinical study, 69 previously untreated hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to receive one year of treatment with either amlodipine (5-10 mg daily) or lisinopril (5-20 mg daily). Doxazosin and bendrofluazide were added as needed to achieve blood pressure control. After 12 months of treatment, clinical blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure and heart mass were similarly reduced by the two treatment regimens. The intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery decreased by 0.048 mm (95% CI -0.066, -0.031 mm) in the amlodipine-treated group but only by 0.027 mm (-0.046, -0.031 mm) in the lisinopril-treated group. 0.007mm). (P<0.05 for difference between treatments). The lumen diameter of the common carotid artery decreased significantly only in patients treated with lisinopril [amlodipine, -0.02 mm (-0.14, 0.10 mm); Lisinopril, -0.21mm (-0.32, -0.11mm); P<0.02], while intima-media area decreased similarly in the two treatment groups [amlodipine -1.32 mm(2) (-1.91, -0.74 mm(2)), lisinopril -1, 26mm(2) (-1.80, -0.72mm(2)); not significant]. The results confirm that a decrease in blood pressure causes a regression of structural changes in the carotid artery in hypertensive patients. The nature of structural regression differed significantly between the two treatment regimens, despite similar reductions in blood pressure. The calcium channel blocker induced a greater regression of the intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery than the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. However, the wall mass of the carotid artery, as indicated by the intima-media area, was reduced to a similar extent by the two treatments. Whether such differences bring a prognostic advantage remains to be seen.",0,0

The contribution of adverse drug reactions and non-compliance to admission to the medical emergency room was analyzed.; A total of 578 consecutive elderly patients admitted to the emergency medical department were interviewed to determine the percentage of admissions due to adverse drug reactions or non-adherence to medication regimens, their causes, consequences, and predictors.; Eighty-three (14.4%) of the 578 admissions were drug-related: 39 (6.7%) due to adverse drug reactions and 44 (7.6%) due to medication non-compliance. One hundred ninety-two (33.2%) patients had a history of non-compliance. Factors associated with an increased risk of exposure due to an adverse drug reaction were patients with diabetes or neoplasia and patients taking a wide variety of drugs. Factors associated with a higher risk of hospitalization for noncompliance were poor medication regimen recall, visits to numerous physicians, female gender, polypharmacy, drug costs, and switching to nonconventional forms of treatment.; Many admissions of older people are medication-related, with non-compliance accounting for a significant proportion of this. Older people who are at high risk of developing a drug-related medical emergency are identified and appropriate interventions can be planned by health policymakers to target them.",0,0

The remaining patients were randomized to either the valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide or valsartan-benazepril combination.; The two combinations induced an additional significant reduction in blood pressure that was of similar magnitude for diastolic blood pressure (-4.5 during valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide treatment and -3.3 mmHg during valsartan-benazepril treatment), but of greater magnitude for systolic blood pressure during valsartan hydrochlorothiazide treatment (-6.77 mmHg) than during concomitant use of valsartan and benazepril (-3.2 mmHg). At the end of the study, the blood pressure of patients who responded to valsartan monotherapy was lower than that of patients who required combination therapy. Valsartan alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide or benazepril was well tolerated.; Therefore, these data indicate that in patients who do not respond adequately to angiotensin II receptor blockade, blood pressure can be further and safely reduced by adding a small dose of a diuretic or an ACE inhibitor, with the diuretic-containing combination tending to be more effective in controlling systolic blood pressure.",0,0

We correlated cross-study odd ratios for differences in systolic pressure between groups.; We analyzed nine randomized trials comparing treatments in 62,605 hypertensive patients. Compared to old drugs (diuretics and B-blockers), calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors provided similar overall cardiovascular protection, but calcium channel blockers reduced stroke risk more (13.5%, 95% CI 1.3–24.2, p =0.03) and less reduction in risk of myocardial infarction (19.2%, 3.5-37.3, p=0.01). Between-study heterogeneity was significant due to the high risk of cardiovascular events with doxazosin in one study and the high risk of stroke with captopril in another; but systolic pressure differed by 2-3 mmHg between the groups in these two studies. Similar systolic differences occurred in one study of diltiazem versus old drugs and in three studies of converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo in high-risk patients. Meta-regression across 27 studies (136,124 patients) showed that odds ratios could be explained by differences in systolic pressure achieved.; Our results emphasize that blood pressure control is important.

They increase the availability of peptides that have vasodilator and other vascular effects; they also inhibit the production of angiotensin II. In animal models, vasopeptidase inhibitors lower blood pressure in low, moderate, and high-renin forms of hypertension, and they also appear to be beneficial in models of heart failure and ischemic heart disease. Studies on hypertension in humans show that these agents are effective in lowering blood pressure regardless of race or age. Experience with omapatrilat, the most clinically advanced of these drugs, has shown that it is more effective than currently available ACE inhibitors or other widely used antihypertensive drugs. Studies with omapatrilat in congestive heart failure have shown beneficial effects on hemodynamics and symptoms. The vasopeptidase inhibitors appear to have a similar safety profile to ACE inhibitors, although the incidence of side effects such as angioedema and cough has yet to be determined.

As it appears that chronic renal failure and proteinuria may well be cardiovascular risk factors, it is exciting to note that recent large-scale epidemiological studies (Heart Outcomes and Prevention Evaluation [HOPE]) show both cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of ACE inhibition to have. It seems paradoxical that such renoprotective effects are clearly evident in diabetes mellitus, in which plasma renin activity can be suppressed. Even in this situation, it appears that the renal angiotensin system or systems are activated and the inhibition of these intrarenal systems is involved in the renoprotective effects of these agents. Recent studies have identified almost all of the components required for generation of angiotensin II in the renal lumen compartment and suggest that there may be a direct effect through AT(1) receptors on NaCl transport in the distal nephron. The possibility that the components of this intraluminal renin-angiotensin system may be acutely regulated by variations in dietary salt intake provides an opportunity to better understand the normal maintenance of salt balance. Whether or not inhibition of these signaling pathways is involved in the renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists is an important question that needs to be addressed.",0,0

We included 18 of 333 adverse drug reaction studies and 22 of 61 allelic variant reviews.; All investigators reviewed and coded articles using standardized summary forms.; We identified 27 drugs that are commonly cited in adverse drug reaction studies. Of these drugs, 59% are metabolized by at least 1 enzyme with an aberrant allele known to cause poor metabolism. Conversely, only 7% to 22% of randomly selected drugs are known to be metabolized by enzymes with this genetic variability (range: P=0.006 to P<0.001).; Our results suggest that drug therapy based on an individual's genetic makeup can lead to a clinically meaningful reduction in adverse outcomes. Our results serve as a basis for further research on how pharmacogenomics can reduce the occurrence of side effects and the resulting clinical, societal and economic implications.",0,0

This HEART neurohumoral substudy examines the changes in vasoconstrictive and natriuretic peptides and their relationship to LV remodeling.; Blood was drawn from 122 patients within 24 hours of MI and at 3, 14, and 90 days after MI for measurement of catecholamines, endothelin-I, angiotensin-II, Nt-proANP and BNP, and prostacyclins. Quantitative echocardiograms were performed at baseline and after 14 days.; All neurohormones except angiotensin II (P=0.12) and prostaglandins were significantly elevated at baseline. Vasoconstrictive neurohormones decreased significantly over time but remained elevated after 14 days. Both Nt-proANP and BNP were elevated within the first 14 days. BNP decreased significantly after 90 days, whereas Nt-proANP showed no change between 14 and 90 days. Ramipril decreased plasma levels of angiotensin II after 3 days but had no effect on the other neurohormones.

Comparison of the effects of atenolol versus ramipril in hypertensive patients.,,"Armentano, R L; Graf, S; RamÃ­rez, A J; Espinosa, J D; Brandani, L; Baglivo, H; SÃ¡nchez, R","The aim of this study was to compare the mechanical and intrinsic effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor versus a beta-blocker on brachial artery compliance. In a double-blind study, 34 patients with essential hypertension were treated for 3 months with either ramipril 2.5-5.0 mg daily (n=17, age 57 +/- 7 years, 11 males) or atenolol 50-100 mg daily (n= 17) treated , age 53 +/- 8 years, 11 men). Blood pressure (BP), brachial artery diameter (D), brachial radial pulse wave velocity (PWV), and effective compliance (Ceff) were measured before and at the end of the study. Isobaric assessment (Ciso) was performed on the entire population studied at a mean mean blood pressure of 110 mmHg. Ramipril significantly reduced blood pressure from 155 +/- 16/94 +/- 6 mmHg to 140 +/- 15/85 +/- 7 mmHg (p<0.001) without heart rate (HR; 74 +/- 10 vs. 75) +/- 12 bpm). In addition, it improved both PWV (18%; p<0.001) and arterial compliance (45%; p<0.001), 35% of which were due to a pressure-independent effect (p<0.01). Atenolol also induced a reduction in both blood pressure (159 +/- 17/96 +/- 10 to 133 +/- 13/81 +/- 8 mmHg; p<0.001) and heart rate (76 +/- 10 to 57 +/- - 7 bpm; p < 0.001). Similarly, PWV (11%; p<0.05) and Ceff (30%; p<0.05) were significantly improved with no significant change in Ciso. This suggests that blood pressure reduction was responsible for the improvement in compliance. In conclusion, it is suggested that atenolol induces only hemodynamic changes, which are mainly mediated by lowering blood pressure. In contrast, the improved brachial buffering function observed after ramipril involves not only hemodynamic changes but also changes mediated by other mechanisms, such as B. a modification of the wall structures.",0,0

A planned sub-analysis of the CAPPP was to evaluate the results in the diabetic population.; In the CAPPP study, 572 (4.9% of 10,985 hypertensive patients) had baseline diabetes and were evaluated according to a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint study design. Patients aged 25 to 66 years with diastolic blood pressure > or = 100 mmHg were included and randomized to receive either captopril or conventional antihypertensive treatment (diuretics and/or beta-blockers); The primary endpoint, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke, and other cardiovascular deaths, was significantly lower in the captopril group than in the conventional therapy group (relative risk [RR] = 0.59; p = 0.018). In particular, cardiovascular mortality, defined as fatal stroke and myocardial infarction, sudden death and other cardiovascular deaths, tended to be lower in the captopril group (RR = 0.48; P = 0.084), and no difference between the study groups for stroke was observed (RR=1.02; P=0.96).

821,11723356,Beyond the usual strategies for lowering blood pressure: therapeutic considerations and combination therapies.,,"Giles, T D; Sander, G E","Rapidly increasing clinical data not only proves not only the crucial importance of even small increases in blood pressure as a pathophysiological factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases, especially in people with diabetes mellitus, but also the therapeutic need for more aggressive blood pressure reduction and the achievement of progressively lower blood pressure goals reducing cardiovascular event rates. JNC VI defined optimal blood pressure as <or=120/80 mmHg and stage 1 hypertension as >or=140/80 mmHg. Target blood pressures are now <or=130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes and <125/75 mmHg for patients with hypertensive kidney disease with proteinuria >1 g/24 hours. Achieving such target pressures is becoming increasingly difficult, particularly in diabetics with chronic kidney disease who require complex, multi-drug antihypertensive therapies. This review article attempts to make some suggestions for the design of such antihypertensive therapies and provides considerations for the appropriate use of diuretics and the most effective drug combinations. Factors that may contribute to drug-resistant hypertension include issues such as failure to maximize drug dosage, suboptimal use of diuretics, non-compliance with prescriptions, and possible confounding effects of such concomitant medications as nonsteroidal and anti-inflammatory drugs or decongestants. The problems underlying drug-resistant hypertension are listed along with strategies to overcome this problem.",0,0

The most popular combinations were sulfonylureas plus metformin, followed by metformin plus insulin and sulfonylureas plus insulin. Sulfonylurea and metformin with insulin have rarely been used. There was no significant difference in the prescription of glyburide and metformin between elderly and young middle-aged diabetics; Many patients over the age of 65 have been treated with a beta-blocker in combination with a long-acting sulphonylurea. Beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers were most commonly prescribed, both as monotherapy and in total therapy. Various two-drug and three-drug combinations of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics were commonly used in 35.5% of patients treated with antihypertensive combinations.

ASA may antagonize some effects of ACEi therapy by inhibiting the synthesis of vasodilator prostaglandins; However, the evidence for this effect from large controlled studies is conflicting. The authors analyzed a database of 18,895 patients from the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardio-3 (GISSI-3) study, in which patients responded within 24 hours of starting either lisinopril treatment or no lisinopril treatment Symptoms of a heart attack were assigned. The aim of the study was to verify the possible negative interaction between ASA and the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in the post-acute phase of acute myocardial infarction. Of 18,895 evaluable patients, 15,841 received ASA on admission. Overall, lisinopril reduced 42-day mortality from 7.1% to 6.3%. Lisinopril reduced mortality from 6.0% to 5.4% in patients receiving ASA and from 13.0% to 10.8% in patients not receiving ASA. The difference in the proportional reduction in mortality is consistent with the fact that a more pronounced lisinopril effect is observed in patients with a higher baseline risk in all study subgroups, one of which corresponds to the group without ASA. Analysis of the incidence of in-hospital serious clinical events revealed no potentially negative interaction between ASA and lisinopril. The same results were obtained from the analysis of the reinfarction after 42 days. The interaction between ASA and lisinopril was also tested by multivariate analysis adjusted for confounding variables upon inclusion, and the interaction tests were not statistically significant. Serum creatinine levels were significantly higher in the lisinopril group than in the control group after 42 days. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the lisinopril group than in the control group after 42 days. The effect of lisinopril on creatinine and blood pressure did not differ between the ASA and non-ASA groups. ASA does not reduce the mortality benefit of early treatment with lisinopril after myocardial infarction, nor does it increase the risk of serious adverse events. Lisinopril is safe and effective when administered early after the onset of myocardial infarction, regardless of concomitant ASA administration that is started early and continued for 6 weeks.",0,0

The aim of the ABC study was to echo previous reports suggesting that drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may not be effective in controlling blood pressure in black hypertensive individuals. Patients were randomized to receive candesartan cilexetil 16 mg (n=156) or placebo (n=148) once daily after a 4- to 5-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Candesartan cilexetil and placebo doses were doubled if seated trough DBP (24 +/- 3 hours post-dose) was 90 mmHg or greater at 4 weeks. If DBP was 90 mmHg or greater at week 8, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg was added to both placebo and candesartan cilexetil 32 mg.

This can be assessed informally through traditional patient interviews, or more formally using validated health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) measures that assess the patient's perception of the tolerability of the drug. HRQL was a secondary endpoint of a 12-week, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of candesartan cilexetil in black patients with systemic hypertension. HRQL was assessed using the generic Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) and the population- and condition-specific Vital Signs Quality of Life Questionnaire (VSQLQ). Data were collected via face-to-face interviews at screening, at baseline, and at weeks 8 and 12. Of the 304 randomized patients, 268 were evaluable for HRQL analysis. Clinical results, reported in the accompanying article, found that candesartan cilexetil, initiated at 16 mg once daily and titrated to 32 mg once daily as needed, with the subsequent addition of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg as needed, reduced diastolic and was effective in lowering systolic blood pressure and was well tolerated according to practice interviews. Analyzes of patient-perceived tolerability revealed that HRQL was maintained throughout the 12-week study period, with no significant differences between treatment and placebo groups at the end of double-blind treatment. These results indicate that the HRQL of black patients with systemic hypertension is maintained during treatment with candesartan cilexetil.",0,0

Efficacy of ramipril in nephropathy.,,"Ruggenenti, P; Perna, A; Remuzzi, G","In this post-hoc secondary analysis of the Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) study, a benefit-risk profile of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition was established in 322 patients with nondiabetic proteinuric chronic nephropathies and varying degrees of renal impairment rated. The rate of decrease in GFR (delta GFR) and incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during treatment with ramipril or non-ACE inhibitors were compared within three tertiles of basal GFR. Delta-GFR was comparable across the three tertiles, while the incidence of ESRD was higher in the lowest tertile than in the middle and highest tertiles. Ramipril reduced delta GFR by 22%, 22%, and 35% and the incidence of ESRD by 33% (p<0.05), 37%, and 100% (p<0.01) in the bottom, middle, and top tertiles, respectively. Delta GFR reduction was predicted by basal systolic (p<0.0001), diastolic (p=0.02), and mean (p<0.001) blood pressure and proteinuria (p<0.0001), but not by basal GFR (p=0.12) predicted. ESRD risk reduction was predicted by basal proteinuria (p<0.01) and GFR (p<0.0001) and was highly dependent on treatment duration (p<0.0001). Adverse events were comparable between the three tertiles and within each tertile in the two treatment groups. Thus, disease progression and response to ACE inhibition are not dependent on the severity of renal impairment. ESRD risk and the absolute number of events saved by ACE inhibition are highest in patients with the lowest GFR. However, renoprotection is maximized when ACE inhibition is started earlier and when long-term treatment can lead to GFR stabilization and definitive prevention of ESRD.",0,0

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the response rate to treatment with these drugs differs in this setting. A single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, comparative study evaluating the efficacy of controlled-release nifedipine or lisinopril in the treatment of hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 mmHg) in ciclosporin (CsA)-treated renal transplant recipients was conducted. Recipients were randomized to receive either lisinopril (10 mg once daily) or controlled-release nifedipine (30 mg once daily). If indicated, the dose was doubled. The number of responders (diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg in monotherapy) was assessed during the early post-transplant period (first 3 months) and during a late post-transplant period (3 to 12 months post-kidney transplantation) in the same patient population. One hundred and fifty-four patients (nifedipine = 78, lisinopril = 76) with uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 mmHg) were randomized within 3 weeks after kidney transplantation. One hundred twenty-three patients (nifedipine = 69, lisinopril = 54) completed the study. Fourteen (20%) of nifedipine-treated recipients responded to treatment during the early and 26 (38%) during the late postoperative period (4-12 months after kidney transplantation). Eleven (20%) of the lisinopril-treated recipients responded in the early and 18 (33%) in the late post-transplant period. Non-responders were on average 8.5 +/- 1.5 kg heavier both in the early phase and after 1 year of treatment (p<0.01) and 6.1 +/- 0.9 years older than responders (p < 0.05).

The efficacy and hormonal profile of omapatrilat and lisinopril were compared in salt-sensitive hypertensive patients. On admission, antihypertensive drugs were discontinued and patients received a single-blind placebo. On day 15, salt sensitivity determinations were made. Salt-sensitive hypertensive patients returned to baseline assessment of ambulatory diastolic blood pressure, ambulatory systolic blood pressure, and atrial natriuretic peptide within 5 to 10 days. Salt-sensitive hypertensive patients were randomized to receive double-blind omapatrilat (n=28) or lisinopril (n=33) with initial doses of 10 mg for 1 week escalated to 40 or 20 mg for an additional 3 weeks. Ambulatory blood pressure and urinary atrial natriuretic peptide were determined at the end of the study. Both omapatrilat and lisinopril significantly reduced mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic and systolic blood pressure; However, omapatrilat produced significantly greater reductions in mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (p=0.008), ambulatory systolic blood pressure (p=0.004), and mean ambulatory arterial blood pressure (p=0.005) compared to lisinopril values. . Both drugs strongly inhibited ACE over 24 hours. Omapatrilat significantly (p<0.001) increased urinary excretion of atrial natriuretic peptide over intervals of 0 to 24 hours (3.8-fold) and 12 to 24 hours (2-fold); Lisinopril produced no change. Omapatrilat significantly (P<0.001) increased urinary excretion of cGMP over the 0-24 and 4-8 hour intervals compared to lisinopril. None of the drugs had a diuretic, natriuretic, or kaliuretic effect. In conclusion, omapatrilat demonstrated a vasopeptidase inhibitor hormone profile and reduced ambulatory diastolic and systolic blood pressure more than lisinopril in salt-sensitive hypertensive patients.",0,0

However, the role of shear stress, the relationship between endothelial dysfunction and mechanics, and the effect of chronic ACE inhibition on this relationship have not been studied. The present study was designed to evaluate the relationship between flow-dependent dilatation and radial artery mechanics at known levels of shear stress in patients with heart failure and to assess the effect of chronic ACE inhibition. The study enrolled 16 patients with stable congestive heart failure who had never been treated with ACE inhibitors. Arterial pressure, cardiac output (bioimpedance), radial artery diameter (echo tracking) and flow (Doppler), whole blood viscosity, and mean arterial wall shear stress were measured before and during a gradual increase in forearm blood flow in response to gradual distal hand skin heating. Cross-sectional indices for radial artery compliance and distensibility were calculated at 34 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 44 degrees C. Endothelium-independent vasodilation was assessed using glyceryl trinitrate. All parameters were evaluated before and 24 hours after the last administration of perindopril (4 mg once daily) or placebo in a 2-month, double-blind, randomized study. Before treatment, there was no difference between the two groups for any parameter. After chronic ACE inhibition, baseline systolic arterial pressure decreased from 126 +/- 11 to 118 +/- 10 mm Hg (P < 0.05). During heating, the increase in diameter in response to shear stress was greater after ACE inhibition than after placebo (time/treatment interaction, P<0.05). In addition, in contrast to placebo, there was a significant increase in compliance (3.23 +/- 0.79 x 10(-7) to 6.82 +/- 2.47 x 10(-7) m) at the same shear stress (2)/kPa). , P<0.05) and Extensibility (5.71 +/- 1.35 x 10(-3) to 8.87 +/- 1.88 x 10(-3)/kPa, P<0.05) during heating after ACE inhibition. The effect of glyceryl trinitrate did not change. The present study demonstrates that chronic administration of the ACE inhibitor perindopril increases the magnitude of flow-dependent dilatation and restores the flow-dependent increase in radial artery compliance and distensibility assessed at stable shear loading. Furthermore, the decrease in baseline systolic arterial pressure after ACE inhibitors suggests an associated increase in the distensibility of the proximal elastic conducting arteries.",0,0

However, there is limited information on whether and to what extent this impairment is ameliorated by pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment. We measured radial artery diameter and blood flow with an echo-tracking Doppler device both at baseline and after 4 minutes of hand ischemia increasing diameter by NO secretion mediated by an increase in flow and shear stress. Data were collected from 44 CHF patients (New York Heart Association Classes I to III) on standard care (diuretic, digitalis and enalapril, 20 mg/d) in whom CHF severity was assessed by cardiopulmonary stress testing and from one age from the age of 16 - and gender-matched controls. CHF patients were then randomized to receive (A) standard of care (n=11), (B) double dose ACE inhibitors (n=11), (C) standard of care angiotensin Maintain II antagonist (losartan), 50 mg/d; n = 11) or (D) Standard treatment with bicycle training for 30 minutes, 3 times per week (n = 11). At baseline, radial artery diameter and flow were similar in CHF patients and controls; CHF patients had modest, albeit significant, impairment in flow increase (-36%) and marked impairment (-78%) in diameter increase after 4 minutes of ischemia. After 2 months, baseline diameter and flow remained unchanged in the 4 groups. After the 4 minutes of ischemia, radial artery flow and diameter increased as before in the standard treatment group (A), while in the other 3 groups the increase was significant (P < 0.05) and significant for diameter (B, 83%, C 92% and D 95%) larger. Trinitroglycerin-induced vasodilation was similar in CHF and controls and was unaffected by treatments. In CHF, the radial artery shows a marked reduction in flow-mediated vasodilation, reflecting impairment of endothelial function. This impairment can be significantly ameliorated by treatments that effectively block the renin-angiotensin system at either the ACE or ACE plus angiotensin receptor level. This is also the case with non-pharmacological treatment of CHF.",0,0
838,11752035,Contribution of volume overload and angiotensin II to increased pulse wave velocity in hemodialysis patients.,,"Tycho Vuurmans, J L; Boer, Walther H; Bos, Willem-Jan W; Blankestijn, Peter J; Koomans, Hein A","Aortic compliance is reduced in patients with end-stage renal disease. This malfunction contributes to high systolic aortic pressures and thus to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. It was hypothesized that, in addition to structural vascular changes, functional changes resulting from hypervolaemia and increased vasoconstrictor activity, particularly angiotensin II, play a role in the decrease in aortic compliance. Nineteen hemodialysis patients were assessed for dry weight before and 24 h after dialysis. Peripheral artery applanation tonometry was used to estimate aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), which is known to depend on aortic compliance, and the increase in aortic systolic pressure (augmentation index [Aix]). Predialysis aortic PWV was increased in dialysis patients compared to matched healthy subjects (9.9 +/- 3.1 vs. 7.5 +/- 1.1 m/s; p<0.05). The AIx was also increased (35 +/- 6 versus 25 +/- 10; P < 0.05). Volume reduction by dialysis had no significant effect on PWV (9.3 +/- 1.5 m/s), but AIx decreased (28 +/- 7; P<0.05). A subset of 10 patients was re-evaluated after 1 week of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEi) inhibition with enalapril 5 mg once daily. ACEi lowered blood pressure both before and after dialysis but had no effect on pulse pressure and heart rate, which remained elevated compared to healthy subjects. ACEi also reduced pre-dialysis aortic PWV from 11.0 +/- 3.5 to 9.1 +/- 2.1 m/s (p<0.05), but had no significant effect on AIx. During treatment with ACEi, the same volume reduction by dialysis further reduced the aortic PWV to 8.0 +/- 1.4 m/s (p<0.05), a figure not different from the PWV in healthy subjects . AIx even decreased to a slightly subnormal value (12 +/- 23; P < 0.05). It was concluded that volume overload and angiotensin II both contribute to increased PWV and AIx in dialysis patients. Both volume reduction and ACEi improve aortic PWV and AIx. The combined volume reduction and ACEi has an enhanced effect that was so great in the present patients that PWV and AIx were no longer elevated. Monitoring and correction of arterial pressure waves is possible and can be an important tool in the management of patients with end-stage renal disease.",0,0

Examination of neurohormonal and clinical responses in patients receiving various doses of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may provide insight into the potential for additional suppression with angiotensin II (AT-II) or aldosterone antagonists.; 75 patients with CHF were randomized to receive either high-dose (40 mg/day, n=37) or low-dose (5 mg/day, n=38) enalapril for six months. The results of exercise tests, echocardiography, tissue-specific ACE activity and monthly neurohormone levels before and after enalapril were compared.; Despite larger within-group improvements in plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone levels in the high-dose group, no statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in all variables except for serum ACE activity at the end of the study. Elevated serum aldosterone and plasma AT-II levels were observed in 35% and 85% of patients, respectively, at 34 weeks, a statistically insignificant difference between groups.

We therefore investigated the long-term effects of adding the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan to standard heart failure therapy.; A total of 5,010 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III, or IV heart failure were randomized to receive valsartan 160 mg twice daily or placebo. The primary endpoints were mortality and the composite endpoint of mortality and morbidity, defined as the occurrence of cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, or receipt of at least four hours of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator therapy.; All-cause mortality was similar in both groups. However, the incidence of the composite endpoint was 13.2 percent lower with valsartan than with placebo (risk ratio 0.87; 97.5 percent confidence interval 0.77 to 0.97; P=0.009), mainly due to a smaller number of patients hospitalized for heart disease errors; 455 (18.2 percent) in the placebo group and 346 (13.8 percent) in the valsartan group (P<0.001). Valsartan treatment also resulted in significant improvements in NYHA class, ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and quality of life compared to placebo (P<0.01). In a post hoc analysis of composite endpoint and mortality in subgroups defined according to background treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers, valsartan had a beneficial effect in patients who had none or one of these types received drugs, but an adverse effect in patients receiving both types of drugs; Valsartan significantly reduces the composite endpoint of mortality and morbidity and improves clinical signs and symptoms in patients with heart failure when added to prescribed therapy. However, the post-hoc observation of an adverse effect on mortality and morbidity in the subgroup receiving valsartan, an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker raises concern about the potential safety of this specific combination.",0,0
842,11759959,To evaluate the efficacy of perindopril on arterial compliance in mild to moderate hypertension.,,,"Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been clearly shown to be effective in controlling blood pressure and hemodynamics in patients with heart failure. In addition, there is evidence that ACEI also have the ability to reduce remodeling in cardiovascular structures in both animal models and humans. Therefore, the reduction in the occurrence of arterial stiffness is also expected, resulting in an increase in distensibility.; In addition to the physical measurement of the arterial wall, the assessment of pulse wave velocity (PWV) is also a widely used index of arterial compliance, which deteriorates over the course of remodeling. To determine the effectiveness of a particular ACEI, perindopril, in increasing arterial compliance and thus reducing PWV, a 6-month multicenter study was conducted in 146 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The study population consisted of 70 males and 76 females aged 56.36 (SD 9.4, range 28-73) years. 73 patients were newly diagnosed, 65 became treated but blood pressure uncontrolled, and 8 became treated patients whose blood pressure was controlled but with adverse events that required a change in treatment regimen.; Mean blood pressure at baseline was 164.25/97.49 mmHg and 11.71 m/s (SD 2.29 range 7.35-20.12 m/s) in mean PWV.

The Individual Data Analysis of Antihypertensive (INDANA) intervention study group and Quan and colleagues analyzed treatment benefit in 23,000 women and 19,975 men according to subgroup meta-analyses from 12 randomized controlled trials comparing antihypertensive drug therapy to placebo. The meta-analyses showed a statistically significant treatment benefit for all reported clinical outcomes in black men of all ages and in black women. In women over 54 years of age, antihypertensive treatment was associated with a significant reduction in fatal and nonfatal stroke, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Overall, there was no significant difference in relative treatment benefit for women and men; however, the absolute treatment benefit was lower in women than in men. Thus, the number of patients requiring treatment for the endpoints fatal stroke, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular events was one to three times higher in women than in men.

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema of the intestine (AIAI) occurs in a minority of patients taking an ACE inhibitor. The clinical presentation includes acute abdominal symptoms, marked intestinal edema and ascites with occasional facial and/or oropharyngeal swelling. AIAI is diagnosed based on the temporal relationship between symptomatic presentation and drug use, the lack of alternative diagnoses, including other causes of angioedema, and the immediate resolution of symptoms after ACE inhibitor discontinuation. Prompt radiological examination (abdominal computed tomography and/or ultrasonography) is crucial to make an early diagnosis and avoid unnecessary surgical procedures. There is a female predominance of AIAI, which may reflect the interaction of estradiol with the various signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiology of AIAI. Treatment of AIAI consists mainly of conservative measures and withdrawal of the ACE inhibitor. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be considered as viable alternatives. Awareness and knowledge of AIAIs is important because of the increasing use of ACE inhibitors, current delays in diagnosis, obvious treatment strategies after diagnosis, and the futility of alternative diagnoses, which can result in significant morbidity.

856,11777296,Meta-analysis of studies of selective alpha1-blockers in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes.,,"Glanz, M; Garber, A J; Mancia, G; Levenstein, M","This meta-analysis of published studies evaluated the effect of selective alpha1-blockers on lipid and carbohydrate profiles and blood pressure (BP) and tolerability in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Publications identified via MEDLINE were used. The text and bibliographies of the retrieved articles were checked for additional references. Clinical studies with a randomized comparison structure (placebo and active treatment arm) and controlled studies with other structures were included. Of the 27 citations identified, 22 studies were selected for inclusion and five were rejected. Efficacy and safety data, lipid and carbohydrate profiles, and study and patient characteristics were independently extracted by two investigators. The mean pooled results showed beneficial effects of selective alpha1-blockers on total serum cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Results also showed that doxazosin had beneficial effects on fasting glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, TC, HDL cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, HDL/TC ratio, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The difference in risk was equivalent between the alpha1-blocker group and the control group for orthostatic hypotension or syncope. This meta-analysis demonstrates a range of beneficial effects of selective alpha1 blocker therapy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. These agents provide an effective modality for lowering blood pressure, with beneficial effects on lipids, no deterioration in glycemic control, and a low risk of orthostatic hypotension.",1,0
857,11779516,Association between antibiotic use and risk of myocardial infarction in the general population.,,"Luchsinger, JosÃ© A; Pablos-MÃ©ndez, Ariel; Knirsch, Charles; Rabinowitz, Daniel; Shea, Steven","There are conflicting reports of an association between Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) infection and coronary artery disease (CAD); randomized trials of antibiotics for secondary prevention of CHD are ongoing. Physicians may be tempted to believe that their choice of antibiotic class when treating an infection may alter CHD risk. Our aim was to determine whether the use of antibiotics with antichlamydial activity in the general population reduces the risk of myocardial infarction. A health insurance database containing 354,258 patients with continuous health and pharmacy insurance for at least 2 years between January 1, 1991 and December 31, 1997 was used for the analyses. Hazard ratios were derived from proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates relating antibiotic prescription to first use associated with a first myocardial infarction occurrence during the observation period, adjusted for history of CAD, age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, Hyperlipidemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There was a total of 1,684,091 observed person-years and 16,139 new-onset myocardial infarctions. The adjusted hazard ratios were 1.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.16) for macrolides, 1.20 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.26) for quinolones, 1.10 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.21) for cephalosporins, 1.00 (95% CI). 0.96 to 1.06) for tetracyclines, 1.01 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.06) for penicillins and 1.13 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.30) for trimetroprim-sulfamethoxazole. The hazard ratios for individual antibiotics active against C. pneumoniae within each group were similar. The use of antibiotics active against C. pneumoniae does not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction in the general population.",0,0

Results showed that captopril was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in 4-week mortality (681 [9.1%] captopril-assigned vs. 730 [9.7%] placebo-assigned deaths; 2P=0.19) , but the long - term effects remained uncertain . The present study reports the long-term effect of early treatment with captopril on mortality and other serious events in AMI patients from the previous CCS-1 study.; Long-term follow-up was conducted in the hospitals that had enrolled more than 20 cases in the CCS-1 study. 8000 patients with MI were thus selected for long-term follow-up. Data from 6749 patients (84.4%) were available.; Patient characteristics were comparable between the treatment group (n=3391) and the placebo group (n=3358). The mean follow-up time was 23.4 +/- 16.9 months; The mean age was 63.6 +/- 10.6 years and 76.2% were male. At the end of the follow-up period, NYHA III-IV cardiac function was 9.0% in the treatment group and 9.8% in the placebo group; the reinfarction rate was 5.6% vs. 6.0%; total cardiovascular events were 32.9% vs. 34.3%. All-cause mortality was 11.9% (n=404) versus 13.8% (n=463), with a 13.8% reduction in the captopril group (p=0.03). Cardiovascular mortality was 10.0% vs. 11.8% (p=0.01), death from heart failure was 4.1% vs. 5.5% (p=0.01). From the above results, early treatment with captopril can save 19 lives for every 1000 patients treated; Patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or = 100 mmHg at admission would have a long-term mortality of 12.4% in the treatment group vs. 13.8% in the placebo group (P = 0.04) and patients with a heart rate (HR ) > or = 60/minute at entry would have a long-term mortality of 12.0% in captopril groups versus 14.5% in the placebo group (P=0.01); Early treatment with captopril during AMI for 4 weeks can significantly reduce long-term all-cause mortality.",1,1

In a randomized study, 822 patients with a first AMI received conventional medical treatment, including intravenous thrombolytic therapy and oral aspirin or metoprolol, and then were randomly assigned to captopril [dosing from initial 6.25 mg to 25 mg/tid, 209 younger patients (< or = 64 years), 269 elderly patients (65-75 years)] or only conventional treatment (131 younger patients, 213 elderly patients). Survival in the four groups was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A multivariate analysis was performed to understand how multiple variables (including age) affect the survival of patients taking captopril in the hospital or during long-term follow-up. Survival of patients taking captopril was significantly correlated with age (P<0.001). Survival of the elderly patients treated with captopril increased during the hospital stay (P < 0.0001), but not the younger ones (P > 0.05). During follow-up, survival of patients taking captopril was not significantly correlated with age (P > 0.05), but both the older and younger patients have good survival rates (all P < 0.01) and fewer cardiac events (all P<0.01). when they were taking captopril.; Captopril exerts a weak effect on younger patients but a positive effect on elderly patients during hospitalization after AMI. However, there is no difference in prognosis between younger and older patients, as both have good survival and fewer cardiac events when taking captopril for a longer period of time during follow-up.",0,0

The literature indicates that sera from patients with DIL generally contain antinuclear antibodies (ANAs); however, ANA negative DIL has been reported. The list of drugs implicated as etiological agents of DIL continues to grow. This list includes two different types of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors - captopril and enalapril. We report the first case of DIL caused by lisinopril. Our patient had negative ANA test and histone antibody (IgG anti-[H2A-H2B]-DNA) results, reflecting the course of the disease. Antibodies against the (H2A-H2B)-DNA complex are observed in more than 90% of patients with active DIL, excluding patients with DIL due to hydralazine. Therefore, it is important to recognize the clinical importance of IgG anti-(H2A-H2B) DNA antibodies and that negative ANA test results do not preclude the diagnosis of DIL.",1,0

Because the cause is unknown, therapies aim to improve peripheral blood flow with vasodilators and antiplatelet agents, prevent the synthesis and release of harmful cytokines with immunosuppressants, and inhibit or reduce fibrosis with agents that reduce collagen synthesis or collagenase production increase . The purpose of this review is to critically analyze current and emerging treatments for systemic sclerosis and localized scleroderma. The discussed therapeutic options for the treatment of systemic sclerosis include the use of (1) vasodilators (calcium channel blockers [nifedipine], angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [captopril, losartan potassium] and prostaglandins [iloprost, epoprostenol]), (2) immunosuppressants (methotrexate, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide and extracorporeal photopheresis) and (3) antifibrotics (D-penicillamine, colchicine, interferon gamma and relaxin). Treatment options studied for localized scleroderma include the use of corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs (calcitriol, calcipotriene), UV-A, and methotrexate. Preliminary reports of new therapies for systemic sclerosis will also be considered. These include the use of minocycline, psoralen UV-A, lung transplantation, autologous stem cell transplantation, etanercept and thalidomide.",0,0

866,11790925,Management of heart failure in the elderly.,,"Rich, Michael W","Management of chronic heart failure in elderly patients is often complicated by the presence of multiple comorbidities, polypharmacy, psychosocial and financial concerns, and difficulties in adhering to complex medication and dietary regimens. In addition, few patients over the age of 80 have been enrolled in clinical trials, leaving uncertain the efficacy of current heart failure therapies in this age group. Taken together, these factors contribute to the persistently high hospitalization and mortality rates and poor quality of life associated with chronic heart failure in the elderly. This article reviews non-pharmacological aspects of care and pharmacotherapy of systolic heart failure in elderly patients. Optimal management requires a systematic approach consisting of 5 key elements: coordinating care across specialties, educating patients and caregivers, improving self-management skills, effective follow-up, and prudent use of medication. However, it must be recognized that even with best-practice interventions, the prognosis for established heart failure remains poor. Future research must therefore be directed towards developing more effective strategies to prevent heart failure in our aging population.",0,0

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of losartan or its combination with quinapril on the cardiac nervous system and neurohormonal status in essential hypertension.; Randomized comparative study of 105 patients with mild essential hypertension conducted at Shizuoka General Hospital. In Phase 1, 40 hypertensive subjects were randomly assigned to the losartan (50 mg) or quinapril (10 mg) group. In phase 2, after 3 months of 10 mg quinapril monotherapy, 65 hypertensive patients were randomized into groups with 50 mg losartan (n = 32) or 5 mg amlodipine (n = 33) in addition to quinapril and treated for a further 3 months. All patients underwent [(123)I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging and neurohormonal measurements before and 3 months after treatment.; Both monotherapies significantly increased renin activity, while losartan monotherapy also increased angiotensin II (AII) concentrations. The washout rate was significantly reduced in both the losartan and quinapril groups (18.1 +/- 11.4 versus 13.9 +/- 11.0%, P<0.0002 and 13.3+, respectively /- 9.3 versus 12.3 +/- 9.1%, P < 00001). ) with no changes in heart-to-mediastinal (H/M) ratio.

The aim of this study was to compare the hemodynamic changes and tolerability of perindopril versus captopril after AMI. We randomized 212 patients to receive either captopril (n=102) or perindopril (n=110) within 72 hours of AMI. Captopril was given as an initial dose of 6.25 mg, then 50 mg/day on day 1 and 100 mg/day thereafter. The corresponding doses of perindopril were 2, 4 and 8 mg/day. Acute hemodynamic changes, the percentage of patients achieving target doses, and cardiovascular events at in-hospital and at 6 months were monitored. The baseline clinical characteristics of the two groups were identical, but the patients randomized to perindopril were in a higher Killip class (1.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.5, p=0 ,05). During the first 6 hours, perindopril treatment resulted in higher minimum systolic (97 +/- 15 vs. 91 +/- 14 mmHg, p<0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (57 +/- 11 vs. 54 +/- - 10 mm Hg, p < 0.02), later occurrence of minimal blood pressure (3.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.1 hours, p < 0.001) and one lower incidence of sustained hypotension with systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg for > or = 1 hour (5% vs. 16%; p<0.01) compared to captopril.

The diagnosis of IMN was made by extensive clinical and pathological studies to the exclusion of secondary forms of membranous nephropathy. No patient was on steroids or cytotoxic agents six months prior to enrollment. In the CSA group, CSA was administered at an initial dose of 5 mg.kg-1.d-1, which was gradually tapered over the first three months and maintained at 2 mg.kg-1.d-1 for 12 months. In the CAP group, CAP was administered at a dosage of 37.5 mg/day.; In the first three months, 6 (6/15) complete responses (CR) and 2 (2/15) partial responses (PR) were observed in the CSA group, while only 2 (2/15) PRs in the CAP group were observed. Before the end of 15 months, 8 patients in the CSA group experienced CR and 4 patients PR. One CR patient relapsed when the dosage of CSA was reduced, leaving 7 patients on CR at the end of the first 15 months. No additional CR or PR was observed in the CAP group during late follow-up. At the last visit (a mean follow-up of 44 months) in the CSA group, an additional 2 CR patients had relapsed and 1 CR patient switched to PR after stopping CSA treatment, leaving 4 CR and 5 PR in the CSA group . In the CAP group, 3 spontaneous CRs occurred at 1.5 years of follow-up, with 3 CR and 2 PR at the last visit. No difference was found between the mean values of the initial and the last serum creatinine levels in both groups. No serious side effects have been identified during CSA treatment. Rebiopsy data from three patients who responded to CSA treatment showed that no pathological improvement of the glomerular basement membrane was observed even in cases in remission. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis was identified in one patient with recurrent CR whose serum creatinine increased above the normal range, but not in the other 2 patients whose serum creatinine remained within the normal range.; CSA therapy at a dose of 5 mg.kg-1.d-1 is effective in inducing remission of nephrotic syndrome in adult IMN patients within three months with an 80% response rate.

870,11794033,[Angiotensin II antagonists versus ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension].,,"Andersen, R S; Christensen, S","The blockade of the renin-angiotensin system has proven to be an important principle in the pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular diseases. There is now overwhelming documentation on the beneficial effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) on mortality and morbidity in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Such documentation is still lacking for the angiotensin II receptor antagonists, which accounted for 77% of ACE inhibitor sales in Denmark in 1999. This review evaluates the therapeutic effect of angiotensin II antagonists versus ACE inhibitors in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. From 21 comparative studies lasting up to one year, it can be concluded that blood pressure reduction is similar in both classes. Both showed relatively few side effects, the only difference being a higher occurrence of cough after ACE inhibitors. Until larger long-term comparative studies of mortality and morbidity have been performed, angiotensin II antagonists should only be used in hypertensive patients who experience unacceptable adverse reactions to ACE inhibitors.",0,0

With this distinctive characteristic mechanism, these agents have emerged as a new class of drugs to treat hypertension and heart failure. Several vasopeptidase inhibitors are currently under clinical investigation. Omapatrilat is the best-studied agent in this class. Clinical trials of omapatrilat in hypertension have consistently demonstrated the drug's effectiveness in a variety of patient populations. In heart failure patients, omapatrilat significantly improved neurohormonal and hemodynamic status. Long-term effects of omapatrilat in patients with heart failure were recently compared with those of conventional therapy in a large phase II study. The results of the study appear promising. Large clinical trials are ongoing, and additional safety and efficacy information from these trials may help define the place in therapy for this agent.",0,0

873,11805530,Effects of alcohol on the heart.,,"Spies, C D; Sander, M; Stangl, K; Fernandez-Sola, J; Preedy, V R; Rubin, E; Andreasson, S; Hanna, E Z; Kox, W J","Some evidence suggests that light to moderate alcohol consumption protects against cardiovascular disease. However, this cardioprotective effect of alcohol consumption in adults is absent at the population level. About 20 to 30% of patients admitted to hospital are alcohol dependent. In medical practice, because of the many side effects that can occur during routine care, it is essential that the amounts consumed by patients are known. Ethanol damage to the heart is evident when alcohol consumption exceeds 90 to 100 g/d. Heavy ethanol consumption leads to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death and cardiac arrhythmias. Alcohol consumption has been associated with increased mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. An early response to drinking was an increased ventricular wall thickness-to-diameter ratio, possibly leading to alcoholic cardiomyopathy with continuous drinking, which had a worse outcome compared to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy when drinking was not stopped or at least reduced (< 60 g/day). . In the intensive care unit, patients with chronic alcoholism have more postoperative cardiac complications. These complications are likely caused by biventricular dysfunction, particularly with the onset of severe infection or septic shock, events that are three to four times more common in chronic alcoholics than in occasional drinkers or non-drinkers. Patients with alcohol abuse and heart failure should be treated in brief intervention and follow-up programs to prevent further alcohol-related complications and for long-term management of alcohol consumption. The prognosis is good even in patients with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure caused by cardiomyopathy, if complete abstinence is achieved. Failure to comply with smoking and alcohol restrictions, which are subject to change, dramatically increases the risk of hospitalizations for patients with heart failure.",0,0

We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of these drugs on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis.; Subjects with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=96, 51% Black) were randomized after an initial 4-week placebo treatment to receive double-blind fosinopril 20 or 40 mg or amlodipine 5 or 10 mg daily for 4 weeks in a fixed dose regimen dose regimen. After 4 weeks of placebo washout, patients received 4 weeks of crossover treatments. After treatment with placebo, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 143 +/- 2 and 86 +/- 1 mm Hg and plasma PAI-1 was 43.4 +/- 2.3 ng/ml. Amlodipine produced greater reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than fosinopril (10 mm Hg vs. 8 mm Hg, P=0.029 and 5 mm Hg vs. 3 mm Hg, P=0.040, respectively), but tended to increase PAI-1, whereas Fosinopril tended to decrease PAI-1 (5.4 +/- 3.6 vs -3.8 +/- 2.5 ng/mL, P=0.045). PAI-1 changes depended on the drug dose (6.5 +/- 6.1 and 3.4 +/- 3.9 ng/mL with amlodipine 10 and 5 mg and -0.4 +/- 3 .1 and -7.4 +/- 4.0 ng/ml with fosinopril 20 and 40 mg, respectively, P for trend 0.024).

875,11817974,Treatment of heart failure in patients with diabetes mellitus.,,"Lavine, Steven J; Gellman, Steven D","Patients with diabetes mellitus have increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Both coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure (CHF) are largely responsible for the increased cardiovascular adverse events in patients with diabetes. This review article discusses the pathophysiology of CHF, the mechanisms of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and the neurohormonal mechanisms involved in both LV dysfunction and CHF. Diabetes with and without hypertension is an important cause of LV dysfunction and CHF. Diabetes may account for the metabolic and ultrastructural causes of LV dysfunction, while hypertension may account for the marked fibrotic changes noted. The experimental induction of diabetes in animals has shed light on the observed biochemical and ultrastructural changes. The role of insulin in reversing both metabolic and structural changes is reviewed using both experimental data and the limited amount of clinical data available. Therapy for CHF in patients with diabetes is similar to that in patients without diabetes, with therapy directed towards the use of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Because morbidity and mortality are higher in patients with diabetes, several studies have highlighted the importance of this subgroup with the potential to have a significant clinical impact. There is a significant opportunity to reduce morbidity and mortality with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors when both ischemia and CHF are present. However, studies in patients with diabetes have been limited to post hoc subgroup analysis and rarely to predefined subgroups. Clinical trials in patients with diabetes, with and without hypertension and LV dysfunction, are clearly needed in the future to adequately address the needs of this high-risk subgroup.",0,0
876,11817979,Quinapril: a further update of its pharmacology and therapeutic use in cardiovascular diseases.,,"Culy, Christine R; Jarvis, Blair","After absorption, quinapril is rapidly de-esterified to quinaprilat (the active diacid metabolite), a potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Quinapril induces favorable hemodynamic changes and improves ventricular and endothelial function in patients with various cardiovascular diseases; these effects are mediated through the binding of quinaprilat to tissue and plasma ACE. Quinapril 10 to 40 mg/day provided effective blood pressure control in most patients with essential hypertension in clinical trials, but some patients required doses of 80 mg/day and/or concomitant diuretic therapy. In general, in comparative clinical trials, quinapril provided blood pressure control similar to other standard antihypertensive therapies, including other ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Combination therapy with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide had a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either drug when used alone in two well-designed studies. Quinapril has also been shown to reduce microalbuminuria in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus. In patients with congestive heart failure, quinapril <or=40 mg/day resulted in beneficial hemodynamic and echocardiographic changes and improved exercise tolerance, symptoms and functional class. The effects of quinapril on survival have not been studied, but quinapril 10 to 20 mg/day showed comparable efficacy to captopril 25 to 50 mg twice daily in two well-designed studies. In patients with coronary artery disease, quinapril 40 mg/day significantly reduced the incidence of ischemic events after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in a well-controlled study (n=148). However, a lower dose of quinapril (20 mg/day) showed no effect on ischemic events or progression of atherosclerosis after 3 years of treatment in a similarly designed study in 1750 patients undergoing coronary artery angioplasty. The tolerability of quinapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. In placebo-controlled studies, cough occurred in 2% and 4.3% and hypotension in <1% and 2.9% of quinapril recipients with hypertension and congestive heart failure, respectively. No increase in side effects was observed when the dosage was increased from 10 to 40 mg/day; Quinapril is now firmly established as an effective and well-tolerated ACE inhibitor for the treatment of patients with high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. Quinapril 40 mg/day also significantly reduced the incidence of ischemic events in patients undergoing CABG in one study; however, a lower dose of quinapril (20 mg/day) had no effect on ischemic events in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty in another study. Additional studies in patients with coronary artery disease receiving quinapril at the optimal dose (40 mg/day) would be helpful.",0,0

The analysis period was 7 years after randomization.; Healthcare payers.; Clinical data were obtained from multiple medical centers in three European countries as described in the published studies. Key economic data was obtained from the US Healthcare Financing Administration's End Stage Renal Disease program.; In the clinical trials on which this economic analysis was based, patients with chronic renal failure of various origins were randomized to antihypertensive therapy with or without concomitant benazepril.; Over a 7-year analysis period, patients randomized to antihypertensive treatment with concomitant benazepril had an average medical cost of $12,991 less than patients prescribed antihypertensive treatment without benazepril and gained 0.091 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) . Costs and QALYs were higher for the benazepril arm than for the placebo arm for all years of analysis after the first. In sensitivity analyzes of changes in key model parameters, rank order stability of the results favoring the benazepril treatment arm was found. Additional economic and health benefits in favor of patients receiving benazepril would be seen if the underlying model rates for dialysis and transplantation were increased, which may be appropriate to reflect differences in treatment practices in the US compared to European countries.; Benazepril therapy as part of the antihypertensive treatment of people with chronic renal failure initially costs money, but the investment costs are quickly recouped and the return on investment continues to grow. The impact of end-stage renal disease on patient health and healthcare costs is great. Thus, the quality-adjusted survival benefits and overall cost savings observed in benazepril recipients over a longer period (2 to 7 years) suggest that the strategy of prescribing benazepril to reduce kidney disease progression in patients with renal impairment is both clinical and clinical is economically advantageous compared to current non-ACE inhibition antihypertensive regimens.",0,0

Blood pressure, renal resistance index (by US Doppler), and UAE (mean of three non-consecutive timed urine collections, micrograms/min) were assessed at baseline and over the course of 24 months of treatment.; Both treatment regimens were effective in reducing blood pressure (mean blood pressure from 123 +/- 1.8 at baseline to 103 +/- 1.5 mm Hg at 24 months in the lisinopril group and from 122 +/- 1.9 at baseline to 104 +/- 0.8 at 24 months in the nifedipine group, p < 0.001 for both groups). Overall, blood pressure reduction was associated with a reduction in UAE and no change in RI throughout the study. Despite similar blood pressure reduction, the two therapies showed different specific effects. Lisinopril was associated with significant decreases in both UAE (33.8 +/- 16.2 at baseline and 9.1 +/- 2.1 at 24 months, p < 0.01) and renal RI (0.61 +/- 0.02 at baseline and 0.56 +/- 0.04 at 24 months, p < 0.05), while nifedipine GITS had no significant impact on UAE (35.7 +/- 12.2 to baseline and 31.2 +/- 12.1 at 24 months, ns) or RI (0.61 +/- 0.01 at baseline and 0.59 +/- 0.02 at 24 months, ns); Effective long-term blood pressure control reduces the severity of organ damage, particularly UAE, while maintaining renovascular resistance in patients with essential hypertension. Different classes of antihypertensive drugs may provide additional specific renal protection beyond blood pressure control. These data could be useful in the development of individualized therapeutic strategies in hypertensive patients at increased renal risk.",0,0
879,11821634,Psychological features and responses to antihypertensive drug therapy.,,"Mann, Samuel J; Gerber, Linda M","The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between psychological characteristics and responses to antihypertensive drug therapy. Twenty-two hypertensive subjects underwent psychological evaluation and were treated with 1) a diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ); 2) an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril; and 3) combined alpha + beta blockade (doxazosin + betaxolol). Anger-out scores on the state-trait Anger Expression Inventory correlated positively with the HCTZ-induced fall in systolic blood pressure (p<0.01); Anger-In was negatively correlated with the quinapril-induced drop in systolic pressure (p<0.05). Target systolic blood pressure (130 mm Hg) was achieved in 79% of subjects without childhood trauma versus 25% of subjects with childhood trauma with either HCTZ or quinapril (p=0.03). Response to doxazosin + betaxolol did not correlate with psychological characteristics. The authors conclude that both inhibited expression of anger and childhood trauma are associated with a decreased response to a diuretic or an ACE inhibitor. Combined alpha/beta-blockade may be preferable to an ACE inhibitor or diuretic in the treatment of selected hypertensive patients. Further studies should include the assessment of psychological factors in response to combined ACE inhibitor and diuretic therapy.",0,0

The pooled endpoints were all-cause mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure; Seventeen studies involving 12,469 patients were included. Overall, ARBs were not superior to controls in pooled rates of death (odds ratio: 0.96; 95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 1.23) or hospital admissions (0.86; 0.69 to 1.06). However, the stratified analysis showed a non-significant trend of the benefit of ARBs over placebo in reducing mortality (0.68, 0.38 to 1.22) and hospital admissions (0.67, 0.29 to 1.51) when they were administered without ACEI background therapy. When compared directly to ACEIs, ARBs were not superior in reducing mortality (1.09, 0.92 to 1.29) or hospitalization (0.95, 0.80 to 1.13). In contrast, combination therapy of ARBs and ACEIs was superior to ACEIs alone in reducing hospitalizations (0.74, 0.64 to 0.86) but not mortality (1.04, 0.91 to 1.20). ; This meta-analysis cannot confirm that ARBs are superior in reducing all-cause mortality or HF hospitalizations in patients with symptomatic HF, particularly when compared to ACEIs.

885,11825317,Angiotensin II receptor blockers used to treat high blood pressure.,,"See, S","The increasing incidence of stroke, congestive heart failure (CHF), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has signaled the need to increase awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension. There remains a need for effective antihypertensive drugs since hypertension is a major precursor to various forms of cardiovascular disease. The renin-angiotensin (AT)-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key component in the development of hypertension and may be a target of drug therapy. Angotensin II (ATII) receptor blockers (ARBs) are the newest class of antihypertensive drugs that act by inhibiting ATII at the receptor level. Currently, national consensus guidelines recommend that ARBs should be reserved for hypertensive patients who are intolerant to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs). However, ARBs are moving to the forefront of therapy with a promising role in renoprotection and CHF. Recent studies such as The Renoprotective Effect of the Angiotensin-Receptor Antagonist Irbesartan in Patients with Nephropathy Due to Type 2 Diabetes Trial (IDNT), the Effect of Irbesartan on the Development of Diabetic Nephropathy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (IRMA2) and The Study "" The Effects of Losartan on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy (RENAAL) has demonstrated the renoprotective effect of ARBs in patients with type 2 diabetes. The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) adds to the growing body of evidence that ARBs can improve morbidity and mortality in CHF patients. As a class, ARBs are well tolerated and have a lower incidence of cough and angioedema compared to ACEIs. This article provides an overview of the differences between ARBs, existing efficacy data in hypertension, and examines the role of ARBs in CHF and kidney disease.",0,0
886,11825318,Pharmacotherapy of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus.,,"Deedwania, P C","The coexistence of hypertension and diabetes dramatically and synergistically increases the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Overwhelming evidence supports aggressive management of high blood pressure in diabetics. However, only a small percentage of patients with diabetic hypertension achieve their treatment goal of blood pressure (BP) < 130/80 mmHg. Tight blood pressure control is not only cost-effective, but also more rewarding than glycemic control. The optimal target for blood pressure control in diabetics should be 130/80 mmHg. In patients with diabetes and renal insufficiency, blood pressure should be reduced to 125/75 mmHg to delay the progression of renal insufficiency. The choice of an antihypertensive agent should be based on established effects on morbidity and mortality rather than on surrogate parameters such as lipid or glucose. Limited data suggest that an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) is the drug of choice, particularly in patients with proteinuria or renal insufficiency. Beta-blockers (betaBs) may be first-line drugs in diabetics with coronary artery disease, while thiazide diuretics (TDs) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are second-line drugs. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may be as effective as ACE inhibitors in diabetics with high blood pressure. Alpha-adrenergic antagonists (AAAs) should be avoided. Most hypertensive patients need more than one means to control their blood pressure. There is no evidence that one combination scheme is supported over another; Nevertheless, a combination of an ACEI with a TD or a betaB may be the most cost-effective treatment compared to other combinations.",0,0

Cutaneous side effects of captopril include angioedema, anaphylactoid reactions, maculopapular rash, piriyasis rosea-like rash, toxic erythema, and exfoliative dermatitis. Some of the immunological captopril-induced cutaneous side effects have been diagnosed by patch testing in recent years. For the first time, a case of a cutaneous immune reaction to captopril with tolerance to enalapril and lisinopril, detected by both patch tests and double-blind challenge tests, is reported. A 71-year-old non-atopic woman presented with a generalized pruritic maculopapular rash. Two months earlier, she had started oral treatment with captopril 50 mg three times a day and glibenclamide 5 mg a day. After the rash appeared, she stopped both medications and the reaction went away. A skin biopsy from one of the lesions revealed a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate of the upper dermis. Skin prick tests with captopril and glibenclamide and patch tests with enalapril, lisinopril and glibenclamide at 1% and 10% pet% and 10% concentrations were positive after 48 hours. Double-blind oral challenge tests with glibenclamide, enalapril, lisinopril and placebo showed a good tolerability The patient was advised to avoid only captopril, as captopril is the only ACE inhibitor containing a sulfhydryl group.

At 52 weeks, the differences between placebo treatment and sibutramine treatment were approximately 3 mm Hg for both mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and supine DBP: mean DBP was 82.8 mm Hg for placebo treatment compared to 85, 5 mm Hg with sibutramine treatment (LOCF; P = 0.004) and the mean SBP was 130.4 mm Hg with placebo versus 133.1 mm Hg with sibutramine (LOCF; P = 0.0497; both comparisons, sibutramine vs. Placebo). The mean increases in SBP and DBP do not appear to change the overall risk category for the coronary artery disease endpoints. Changes in pulse rate at week 52 were a decrease of 0.3 beats per minute (bpm) in placebo treatment compared to an increase of 5.7 bpm in sibutramine treatment (p<0.001). Prescribed study discontinuations due to protocol-defined changes in blood pressure were not statistically different between the two treatment groups. Larger favorable changes in lipid profile, serum glucose, and uric acid could be explained by larger weight losses that occurred in the sibutramine treatment group. Sibutramine was well tolerated. This study indicates that in obese patients whose hypertension is initially well controlled on an ACE inhibitor, sibutramine, with or without concomitant thiazide diuretic therapy, is safe and effective in achieving weight loss without compromising good blood pressure control.",0,0

Treatment consists primarily of a complete medical history and a thorough clinical examination. Ultrasound is recommended as the first imaging test, although a mammogram may be added to confirm the diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration cytology results can be poor due to the low yield of pathologic specimens, and it should be reserved if malignant lesions are suspected. Endocrine evaluation of gynecomastia is rarely conclusive and such testing is best done selectively. Many patients can be treated simply with confidence in the benign nature of the condition. In patients in whom a stimulus has been identified, treatment modification may improve symptoms. In younger patients, hormonal manipulation may be appropriate, but testicular tumor must be ruled out. Surgery should be reserved for patients who are unresponsive to hormones and patients with severe cosmetic deformities.",0,0

In intention-to-treat analysis, the blood pressure (BP) difference between groups was 10.1/4.5 mmHg (P<0.001). Active treatment reduced the incidence of fatal and non-fatal stroke (primary endpoint) by 42% (p=0.003). With active treatment, all cardiac endpoints decreased by 26% (p=0.03) and all cardiovascular endpoints by 31% (p<0.001). Cardiovascular mortality was slightly lower with active treatment (-27%, P=0.07), but all-cause mortality was unaffected (-14%, P=0.22). For all-cause (P=0.009) and cardiovascular mortality (P=0.09), the benefit of antihypertensive treatment diminished with increasing age, and for all-cause mortality it decreased with lower systolic blood pressure at entry (P=0, 05). The benefit of active treatment was not independent of gender or the presence of cardiovascular complications at study entry. The antihypertensive regimen was more effective in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes at admission. Further analysis also suggested a benefit in patients taking nitrendipine as sole therapy. The per-protocol analysis largely confirmed the intention-to-treat results. Active treatment reduced all strokes by 44% (p=0.004), all cardiac endpoints by 26% (p=0.05), and all cardiovascular endpoints by 32% (p<0.001). All-cause mortality was reduced by 26% (p=0.05), but a similar reduction in cardiovascular mortality did not reach statistical significance in this analysis.

In the current study, the effect of intensive versus moderate diastolic blood pressure (DBP) control on diabetic vascular complications in 480 normotensive type 2 diabetics was evaluated.; The current study was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in normotensive type 2 diabetics. Subjects were randomized to intensive (10 mm Hg below DBP baseline) versus moderate (80 to 89 mm Hg) DBP control. Patients in the moderate therapy group received placebo, while patients randomized to intensive therapy received either nisoldipine or enalapril as the initial antihypertensive drug in a blinded manner. The primary endpoint evaluated was change in creatinine clearance, with secondary endpoints consisting of change in urinary albumin excretion, progression of retinopathy and neuropathy, and occurrence of cardiovascular disease.; The mean follow-up time was 5.3 years. Mean blood pressure in the intensive group was 128 +/- 0.8/75 +/- 0.3 mm Hg versus 137 +/- 0.7/81 +/- 0.3 mm Hg in the moderate group, P< 0.0001.

It is often multifactorial in this group. The most common causes are high blood pressure and coronary heart disease, with heart valve disease playing an increasing role. The most common trigger of pre-existing heart failure is non-adherence to medication or diet; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are particularly likely to aggravate the condition. Diagnosis can be difficult as typical signs are often absent or masked in the elderly, but plasma levels of the natriuretic peptide in the brain appear to be a reliable indicator and may provide diagnostic tests in the future. Systolic heart failure is treated with conventional therapy (diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers). Treatment of diastolic heart failure is less well defined, but symptoms should be managed, ischemia prevented, and underlying causes identified and treated.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is important for cardiovascular growth. There is extensive experimental documentation in animals that the angiotensin II antagonist losartan reduces the cardiac hypertrophy response caused by increased arterial pressure as well as intravascular volume overload. However, human data are scarce. This is a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design study in 50 patients with essential hypertension. The results show that both drugs were equally effective in reducing blood pressure and also left ventricular mass (P < 0.001). After 3 years of treatment, the glomerular filtration rate increased significantly with losartan (P<0.005). Serum uric acid decreased slightly, although significantly, in a dose-dependent manner in patients treated with losartan compared to an increase in patients treated with enalapril. A decrease in serum potassium compared to the pre-study period was observed in all patients. There was no difference between treatments in terms of patient satisfaction with quality of life. Both drugs have relatively similar hormonal and hemodynamic effects with an excellent tolerability profile; they seem to induce comparable drops in blood pressure, especially in hypertensive patients, therapy based on a specific Ang II blockade can offer advantages in high-risk hypertensive patients if left ventricular hypertrophy is present. Both enalapril and losartan, by improving renal function and attenuating the intrarenal effects of angiotensin II, may be able to reverse the pathophysiology of essential hypertensive kidney disease and should be drugs of first choice in the treatment of essential hypertension.",0,0

Antihypertensive drugs were titrated and combined to reduce daytime diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. Echocardiograms were obtained at baseline and at follow-up. Mean systolic/diastolic clinical blood pressure, 24-hour BP, and LVM index were similar in previously untreated (n=64) and previously treated (n=109) patients, averaging 171/102 mm Hg, 151 /97 mmHg and 118 g/m2.

Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) antagonists may be able to reverse LVH independent of the antihypertensive effect in the ESRD setting. Thirty chronically hemodialyzed uremic hypertensive patients were randomized to treatment with the AT1-R antagonist losartan (n = 10), the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACD) inhibitor enalapril (n = 10), or the calcium channel blocker amlodipine (n = 10 ) allocated. Left ventricular mass index (LVM) was measured by echocardiography before and 6 months after treatment. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics did not differ between the three groups. The mean LVM base index also did not differ in the three groups. After 6 months of treatment, treatment with losartan reduced the LVM index significantly (-24.7 +/- 3.2%) than therapy with amlodipine (-10.5 +/- 5.2%) or enalapril (-11, 2 +/- 4.1%). All three groups had a similar decrease in mean blood pressure with treatment. Plasma angiotensin II concentrations increased 5-fold with losartan treatment. In contrast, plasma angiotension II concentrations did not change with enalapril and increased only 2-fold with amlodipine.

We therefore set out to characterize the time course of vascular RAS reactivation during chronic ACE inhibitor therapy.; AI/AII vascular conversion was studied in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients receiving chronic lisinopril therapy by differential infusion of AI and AII into the brachial artery. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine if there were differences in vascular AI/AII conversion according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. In a second longitudinal study, 28 patients with NYHA I to II CHF were serially followed for 18 months to see if vascular ACE inhibition was progressively lost over time despite ACE inhibitor therapy. A third study examined whether increasing the lisinopril dose affected subsequent vascular ACE inhibition.; In the cross-sectional study, vascular AI to AII conversion was significantly reduced in NYHA class III compared to class I/II (p<0.05). In the longitudinal study, inhibition of vascular ACE was significantly reduced at 18 months compared to baseline (p<0.001), suggesting gradual reactivation of vascular ACE in CHF over time. In the third study, tissue ACE inhibition could be restored by increasing the ACE inhibitor dose.; Vascular AI/AII conversion reactivates over time during chronic ACE inhibitor therapy even when the CHF disease process is clinically stable.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor facilitating bradykinins, algesic peptides and/or an AT1 receptor antagonist can alter hypoalgesia associated with hypertension in humans. The study was approved by our department's Ethics Committee.; A total of 22 hypertensive patients underwent tooth pulp stimulation to assess tooth pain threshold and tolerance and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring along with a control group of 55 normotonics. The hypertensive patients were then randomized to treatment with enalapril or losartan and reassessed (perceptions of toothache and outpatient monitoring) after 8 weeks of the first treatment and after an additional 8 weeks of the second treatment. Untreated hypertensive patients showed a reduced perception of painful stimuli compared to normotonic patients. A significant reduction in both pain threshold and tolerance was observed during antihypertensive treatments (Friedman's test: P=0.007 and P=0.006, respectively). Pain sensitivity was similar during the two treatments and did not differ from the pain sensitivity scores of the normotensive controls. ANCOVAs were calculated to assess the relationship between antihypertensive agents and pain sensitivity after blood pressure control.

However, since in-office blood pressure measurements reflect, to a limited extent, out-of-office blood pressure, an INSIGHT sidearm study was also conducted, in which patients underwent both in-office measurement and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.; The study had a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design. After 4 weeks of placebo, patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension for 3.1 years were randomized to receive nifedipine GITS 30 mg or amiloride 2.5 + hydrochlorothiazide 5 mg. Dose titration was by dose doubling and addition of 25-50 mg atenolol or 5-10 mg enalapril or other drugs as needed. The analysis was carried out according to intention-to-treat and included the calculation of ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate values over 24 hours, day and night. Additional analyzes included calculation of the trough-to-peak ratio and the smoothness index (the ratio between the average of the 24-hour blood pressure reductions after treatment and its standard deviation); A total of 151 patients were recruited and 149 were valid for analysis: 78 patients had 24-hour outpatient recordings both at baseline and during treatment, and 134 during treatment. Blood pressure readings in the office, 24 hours a day, and day and night were all significantly and similarly reduced by both treatments. Ambulatory and ambulatory heart rate was left unchanged by diuretics while it was slightly reduced by nifedipine. Median trough-to-peak ratios were always > 0.5 and superimposable between the two treatment groups. Similarly, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure smoothness indices for nifedipine and diuretics were comparably high, indicating a similarly balanced antihypertensive response to both drugs. No significant differences in the number of cardiovascular events were observed between the two treatment groups (17 in the nifedipine-based and 26 in the diuretic-based treatment group).

909,11875587,Vasopeptidase inhibition: a novel approach to cardiovascular therapy.,,"Floras, John S","Omapatrilat is designed to simultaneously inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). The ubiquitous involvement of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, originally thought to be the axis of sodium and fluid metabolism in inflammation, thrombosis, and cardiac and smooth muscle hypertrophy, is a major factor in disease progression in conditions as diverse as hypertension, heart failure , coronary artery disease and diabetes. The disruption of angiotensin II production and bradykinin degradation by ACE inhibition is an important therapeutic advance in the treatment of these diseases. NEP metabolizes both bradykinin and the natriuretic peptides (atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, C-type natriuretic peptide and adrenomedullin). These peptides counteract the adverse effects of angiotensin II through their vasodilator, natriuretic, diuretic, and autonomic neural actions; by their antitrophic effects; and by suppressing plasma renin activity. These two systems can be considered as key components of a cardio-renal axis that keeps blood pressure and cardiopulmonary blood volume in a stable range. This balance is compromised in heart failure and primary hypertension. The combination of ACE and NEP inhibition should enhance the beneficial hemodynamic and tissue effects of bradykinin and the natriuretic peptides. Vasopeptidase inhibition is therefore a new approach to cardiovascular therapy with implications for hypertension, heart failure, renal function, and ischemic heart disease.",0,0

In this study, the effects of losartan and enalapril on Hb levels in relation to serum erythropoietin (EPO) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels were examined in 8 patients with PTE and 10 patients without PTE. All 18 patients were sequentially treated with 24 weeks of losartan therapy followed by 24 weeks of enalapril therapy; The two treatment phases were separated by a wash-out phase. Patients with PTE had significantly higher baseline Hb and IGF-1 concentrations compared to patients without PTE, both before treatment with losartan and before treatment with enalapril. Baseline serum EPO levels were similar in patients with and without PTE. Baseline Hb levels correlated significantly with IGF-1 levels (r = 0.517; P = 0.002) but not with EPO levels. Treatment with enalapril 5 mg reduced Hb levels more significantly than treatment with losartan 50 mg in patients with PTE. In patients without PTE, enalapril 5 mg slightly decreased Hb levels, while losartan 50 mg had no significant Hb-lowering effect. The reduction in Hb levels with enalapril therapy in patients with PTE was associated with a significant reduction in circulating IGF-1 levels but not EPO levels, while losartan reduced Hb levels without significant change in circulating IGF-1 levels. and lowered EPO levels. In patients without PTE, there was no significant change in serum EPO and IGF-1 levels with either treatment. The differential Hb-lowering effect of treatment with losartan and enalapril in patients with and without PTE suggests that the pathogenesis of PTE is complex and heterogeneous. Different erythropoietic mechanisms may be involved in patients with and without PTE.

Blood pressure, packed cell volume and hemoglobin concentration, proteinuria and renal function were compared by intention-to-treat analyses.; Packed cell volume and hemoglobin concentration at baseline were positively correlated with body weight (p=0.02), systolic (p=0.01) and diastolic (p=0.04) blood pressure, serum creatinine (p=0.009), blood urea (p = 0.008), and proteinuria (p = 0.003). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained stable in the study group but increased in the control group. In study patients, mean (SD) packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration, and proteinuria fell from 63.5% (4.9) to 56.8% (4.1), p<0.0001; 207 (18) to 164 g/L (13), p<0.0001; and from 358.6 (260.3) to 247.7 mg/24 h (208.2), p<0.002, but did not change significantly in controls. At 12 and 24 months of follow-up, packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration, and proteinuria differed significantly between groups (p<0.0001 for each comparison). In study patients, follow-up changes in hemoglobin volume (r=0.88, p<0.0001) or hemoglobin concentration (r=0.83, p<0.0001) and proteinuria were strongly correlated. Enalapril was well tolerated by all patients.; ACE inhibition therapy effectively and safely alleviates high-altitude polycythemia and reduces proteinuria.",0,0
912,11881062,Discordant responses to two classes of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system.,,"Sever, P S; Chang, C L","Marked heterogeneity characterizes the blood pressure (BP) response to antihypertensive drugs. The efficacy of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is predicted (albeit weakly) by plasma renin activity (PRA), and it has been suggested that there is a correlation in individuals in the effectiveness between drugs that work in different ways There are sites for blocking the RAAS.; The present study was a randomized, double-blind, 2-way, crossover study to evaluate intraindividual BP responses to an angiotensin II AT receptor blocker (ARB), candesartan cilexetil, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) . ), lisinopril, and to identify potential phenotypic features of patient response to the drugs.; 92 patients with essential hypertension (mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure 160/101 mmHg) participated in the study, of which 76 patients completed both treatments; There was marked heterogeneity in response to the two drugs. 50% of patients responded to both drugs (reduction in diastolic blood pressure to > 10 mmHg or achieved diastolic pressure < 90 mmHg); 16% did not respond to both drugs; 20% responded to ACE-I but not to ARB, and 15% responded to ARB but not to ACE-I. Individual responses to the two drugs were poorly correlated (for diastolic pressure: r = 0.19, p = 0.11; for systolic pressure: r = -0.01, p = 0.92). In ACE-I, the decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure was related to pretreatment PRA (for diastolic pressure: r=0.31, p=0.008; for systolic pressure: r=0.24, p=0.04). In the case of ARB, no association between the drop in blood pressure and PRA was observed. These observations suggest that more complex mechanisms may be involved in blood pressure lowering with ARBs than with ACE-I.",0,0
913,11881131,To evaluate the safety and efficacy of telmisartan and enalapril with the possible addition of frusemide in patients with moderate renal impairment and mild to moderate hypertension.,,"Hannedouche, T; Chanard, J; Baumelou, B","The effect on renal function and efficacy of the angiotensin II AT1 receptor blocker (ARB), telmisartan, has been compared with that of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 95-114 mmHg) in moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance [Ccr] 30-80 ml/minute). The study design was multicentre, double-blind, double-blind and active-controlled, with patients randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive telmisartanor enalapril. After a two-week placebo run-in period, the 71 eligible patients received either telmisartan 40 mg or orenalapril 10 mg once daily for four weeks. Thereafter, doses were titrated to 80 mg telmisartan or 20 mg enalapril once daily if trough DBP was still > or = 90 mmHg in the supine position. After a further four weeks, the dose was again titrated to telmisartan 80 mg or enalapril 20 mg, or additional frusemide was given if the double dose had already been administered. Mean decreases in Ccr of 4.6% for telmisartan and 2.8% for forenalapril were not clinically significant. Adverse events occurred in 12 (26.7%) of the telmisartan-treated patients and 12 (46.2%) of the enalapril-treated patients. The mean reduction in supine DBP from baseline to the last available value was 12.5 mmHg for telmisartan compared to 11.9 mmHg for enalapril. Complete (> or = 10 mmHg reduction) or partial (7-9 mmHg reduction) responses occurred in 78% of telmisartan patients and 65% of enalapril patients. In the enalapril group, 43% of patients required frusemide compared to 29% in the telmisartan group. In summary, telmisartan has no adverse effect on renal function, is effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in patients with moderate renal impairment and is comparable to enalapril.",0,0

Prescriptions were collected in May and June 2000 to include a study population of 1266 patients with diabetes and hypertension.; As monotherapy, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (37.9%) and beta-blockers (38.3%) were the most commonly prescribed classes of antihypertensive drugs by FPs and primary care physicians, respectively. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were ranked third by both physician categories. For dual combinations, a beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor was the combination of choice for both physician categories. Patients treated by the FPs were more likely to be receiving a beta-blocker-CCB combination (17.4 vs 14.9%) or a diuretic-ACE inhibitor combination (16.7 vs 11.4%) and less likely to be receiving a beta-blocker combination diuretics (11.8 vs. 16.7%) than those managed by general practitioners. The proportion of patients receiving antihypertensive combinations was 40.6% and 38.5% for FPs and GPs, respectively. While general practitioners most commonly prescribed CCB as monotherapy to older people, FPs chose a beta-blocker. Diuretics were less preferred by both FPs and GPs. Beta-blocker ACE inhibitors were again the most preferred combination of FPs and GPs. FPs were more likely to prescribe CCB-beta blocker combinations than primary care physicians (p=0.01), while CCB-ACE inhibitor combinations were less preferred (p=0.09). A trend towards excessive use of short-acting nifedipine monotherapy in elderly patients has been noted, both by FPs and general practitioners. Glibenclamide, alone or in combination with metformin, was the main antidiabetic drug prescribed by FPs and GPs. Middle-aged patients (45-64 years) treated by general practitioners were more likely to receive glibenclamide than patients treated with FPs (p=0.001), and less likely to receive gliclazide (p=0.01). Combinations of a beta-blocker with either glibenclamide or insulin were prescribed far more often by general practitioners.; Within the same practice setting, a significant difference was observed between FPs and GPs in terms of preference for different drug classes in the management of diabetic hypertension. The compliance of FPs and GPs was suboptimal; overall, however, the compliance of the FPs was closer to the recommended guidelines. Educational programs should specifically address these inadequacies in order to improve the quality of health care.",0,0

Therefore, an open-label prospective and randomized pilot study was conducted in patients with mild to moderate hypertension to evaluate the effect of various antihypertensive drugs, namely enalapril, felodipine and prazosin, on blood pressure and plasma fibrinogen levels. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were determined at 0, 4, and 8 weeks, while plasma fibrinogen assays were performed at baseline and at the end of 8 weeks of treatment in all drug-treated groups. It was observed that although all three drugs were effective in controlling blood pressure, only enalapril significantly decreased plasma fibrinogen levels. Because of this additional effect, enalapril has the potential to simultaneously control two important cardiovascular risk factors - hypertension and high plasma levels of fibrinogen.",0,0

Bristol Myers Squibb.,,"Tabrizchi, R","Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) is developing the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat, a dual inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), for the potential treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart failure [306287 ]. An NDA for the use of omapatrilat in hypertension was submitted to the FDA and regulatory authorities in the EU in December 1999 [351207], [353287]. In April 2000, BMS voluntarily withdrew the NDA in response to questions from the FDA regarding the relative frequency and severity of a rare adverse reaction (angioedema) reported in the NDA database. Prospective controlled clinical trials in patients with hypertension and heart failure should be continued. In May 2001, BMS reported that its blinded omapatrilat hypertension study was ongoing, and pending supportive results from a data analysis expected in late summer/early fall 2001, the company anticipated resubmitting an NDA to the FDA [409203]. In July 2000, BMS reported that it was planning to conduct a 25,000-patient multinational study (OCTAVE – Omapatrilat Cardiovascular Treatment Assessment versus Enalapril) to compare the efficacy and safety of omapatrilat versus enalapril in the treatment of hypertension [374909]. The OCTAVE study was supposed to generate data by mid-2001, which could enable a start in early 2002 [380280]. Phase III studies for hypertension had started in January 1998 [273646]. In January 2001, Merrill Lynch expected BMS to resubmit its NDA to the FDA in the second half of 2001 [395423]. In February 2001, Credit Suisse First Boston made a similar prediction, adding that they expect BMS to launch the drug in late 2002 or early 2003. Analysts also forecast peak sales for the drug of $585 million in 2005 [399484]. In May 2001, Merrill Lynch estimated sales for 2005 at $1.8 billion [411811].",0,0

English language articles were identified. Additional relevant articles were identified from reviewing the references of these articles.; All identified references have been verified. All articles deemed relevant to the topic of this article have been included.; It has been suggested that the blood pressure lowering effects of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may be less in black patients than in other races. Retrospective reanalysis of large heart failure studies suggest that black patients may not experience a significant benefit in terms of morbidity or mortality when heart failure is treated with ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers. It has also been suggested that black patients respond better to the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate than non-black patients.; Published reanalyses of studies of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers in heart failure provide weak data demonstrating a lack of benefit in black patients. The published literature on this topic is limited by its retrospective nature.

ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) reduce MA and are neutral to total cholesterol and triglycerides. However, the effect of ACE inhibitors and CCBs on lipid subfractions such as Lp(a), apolipoprotein (apo) A1, apo B and others is unclear. The current study tests the hypothesis that a fixed-dose combination of an ACE inhibitor, benazepril (B), with the dihydropyridine CCB, amlodipine (A), further lowers arterial pressure and reduces atherogenic lipid fractions compared to either agent alone.; A multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group design was used to study 27 participants with type 2 diabetes. Measurements for total cholesterol, high and low density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL), triglycerides, Apo A1, Apo B, Lp(a), MA, arterial pressure, and creatinine clearance were performed at baseline and at 12-week intervals throughout the 36 -week study.; Arterial pressure was significantly reduced in all three groups at 36 weeks (P=0.0078 for A, P=0.0039 for B, and P=0.0313 for A+B). MA was reduced in all groups, with relatively greater reductions in the B (P<0.05) and A+B groups (P<0.03) versus A. An increase from baseline in mean HDL-cholesterol was noted found in the B and A+B groups ; P < 0.05), but not in the A group. A trend was also observed between the increase in HDL cholesterol and the decrease in MA in the B and A+B groups. Furthermore, only the B group showed a decrease in the median value of Lp(a) (P<0.05).; These data support the concept that ACE inhibition with B reduces the atherogenic profile by decreasing Lp(a) and increasing HDL-cholesterol, the latter correlating with reductions in MA. While A+B had similar trends in lipid subfractions and MA as B, this group had the greatest reduction in systolic blood pressure of the three groups. Therefore, the use of A+B offers the benefits of a reduced atherogenic profile with a higher likelihood of reaching the blood pressure goal recommended by national guidelines.",0,0

Normoalbuminuric essential hypertensive subjects, < 50 years of age, who had not previously been treated with antihypertensive drugs and who did not have diabetes mellitus were included. After the initial assessment, patients were treated exclusively with non-pharmacological measures (n=62), beta-blockers (n=38), ACE inhibitors (n=64), calcium channel blockers (n=8), and multiple classes (n=15). Measurements of office blood pressure, biochemical profile and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion were taken at baseline and measured annually for a mean follow-up of 2.7 +/- 1.2 years. Of the 187 patients included, 22 (11.7%) developed microalbuminuria (progressors, 4.4/100 patients/year). There were no differences between progressors and those who remained normoalbuminuric (non-progressors) with respect to age, gender, body mass index, disease duration, blood pressure values, biochemical profile, family history of diabetes or hypertension, smoking habits, or the presence of left ventricular ECG Hypertrophy. The group with the lowest rate of progression were the ACE inhibitor-treated patients (n=5; 2.9/100 patients/year), followed by the diet group (n=5; 3.3/100 patients/year) and the group the beta blockers (n=5; 4.1/100 patients/year). When we excluded patients treated with calcium channel blockers or those who switched between different treatment classes over time, no significant differences in the incidence of microalbuminuria between groups were observed. Progressors had higher slopes of fasting glucose (4.78 +/- 11.4 versus 0.50 +/- 6.8 mg/year, P < 0.02) and uric acid (0.58 +/- 0.93 versus 0 .05 +/- 1.10 mg/year, P<0.03) compared to the slopes of nonprogressors. Both the slopes for glucose and systolic blood pressure over time were independently associated with the slope of the logarithm of urinary albumin excretion when adjusted for age, sex, and treatment groups. Cox proportional hazard model for microalbuminuria progression showed that baseline urinary albumin excretion (risk ratio [RR] = 1.06; confidence interval [CI] 95%, 1.01 to 1.11), the slope for the systolic blood pressure (RR = 1.11; CI 95%, 1.03 to 1.20) and the slope for glucose (RR = 1.08; CI 95%, 1.03 to 1.14) were compared independently associated with the development of microalbuminuria.

Renal vascular resistance was reduced by each active treatment, with the most significant reduction occurring in the combination phase. GFR was unaffected by any treatment.; In contrast to the effects of the two substances alone, a combination of half the dose of eprosartan and half the dose of enalapril had a marked effect on renal blood flow. The effects of eprosartan on RPF are mediated, at least in part, by increased bioavailability of nitric oxide in renal vessels.",0,0

936,11934344,Treatment options for renovascular hypertension.,,"Spence, J David","Renovascular hypertension is usually caused by atherosclerotic narrowing of the origin of the renal artery and is much more common than previously thought in patients with peripheral vascular disease, carotid stenosis, or heart failure. Renovascular hypertension must be distinguished from renal artery stenosis. In true renovascular hypertension, the kidney takes over the blood pressure and will do whatever it takes to push the blood pressure high enough to force blood through the blocked artery. This can be diagnosed with functional tests that measure glomerular filtration rate before and after blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or antagonists of the AT(1) subtype of the angiotensin receptor. There are insufficient data to make evidence-based recommendations for the management of renovascular hypertension. There are only two randomized trials of angioplasty versus drug therapy, and of these, the larger one in the group originally assigned to drug therapy was heavily contaminated by angioplasty. There is only one study of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition compared to alternative medical therapy. The drugs that are most effective in the medical treatment of renovascular hypertension - angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor 1 blockers - are stopped for fear of a very rare complication (acute renal failure in patients with severe stenosis of both kidneys) tended to avoid arteries or the artery to a single remaining kidney). This fear is misplaced not only because it is rare (< 5% of patients with renovascular hypertension), but because it is reversible and treatable with revascularization. Patients with renovascular hypertension should be evaluated using the nuclear medicine differential glomerular filtration rate enhanced by blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. If drug therapy is ineffective or results in severe impairment of renal function, revascularization is required. Some experts prefer surgical revascularization because of the occasional failure of angioplasty and the risk of renal function deterioration after angioplasty.",0,0

Observing a patient whose pemphigus vulgaris (PV) worsened after taking fosinopril prompted us to investigate an experimental way to assess its liability. Normal human skin (NHS) sections were incubated simultaneously for 2, 6, 12 and 24 h at 4 °C with progressively diluted fosinopril and captopril solutions and used as indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) substrates for 2 sera expressing anti- Desmoglein-3 (anti-Dsg3) antibody at a dilution of 1/160. For captopril, IIF was negative regardless of dilution and incubation time. Only at a dilution of 1/40,000 was IIF positive. For fosinopril, IIF was negative at the 2 and 6 hour incubations but became positive at 12 hours and remained so at all other solutions and incubation times. IIF negativity with captopril suggested that anti-Dsg3 antibodies contained in the PV sera could not find molecules in NHS to bind to. Captopril would therefore induce acantholysis by blocking adhesion molecules. In the case of fosinopril, on the other hand, partial blocking of the adhesion molecules was observed only in the very concentrated solution, which is unlikely in vivo. Therefore, fosinopril is unlikely to be able to block adhesion molecules in vivo. Our method could be used to verify the acantholytic properties of a drug.",0,0

942,11955029,Chronic kidney disease: renoprotective benefits of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system.,,"Remuzzi, Giuseppe; Ruggenenti, Piero; Perico, Norberto","Progression to renal parenchymal damage and end-stage renal disease, which appears largely independent of initial damage, is the final common pathway for chronic proteinuric nephropathies in animals and humans. The key event is increased glomerular capillary pressure; this impairs glomerular permeability to proteins and allows excessive amounts of protein to reach the lumen of the proximal tubule. The secondary process of reabsorption of filtered proteins may contribute to renal interstitial damage through activation of intracellular events including upregulation of genes encoding vasoactive and inflammatory mediators. Both interstitial inflammation and disease progression can be controlled by drugs such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which strengthen the glomerular permeability barrier to proteins, thereby limiting proteinuria and filtered protein-dependent inflammatory signals. Clinical data strongly suggest that remission can now be achieved in some patients with chronic kidney disease. However, due to the current lag time between initiation of treatment and remission, a significant proportion of patients still progress to end-stage renal disease before renal function begins to stabilize. A multimodal approach that focuses on reducing or eliminating all risk factors associated with kidney disease progression can shorten the time to disease remission in most patients with proteinuric nephropathies.",0,0

945,11967252,Effects of celecoxib on ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive patients on ACE inhibitors.,,"White, William B; Kent, Jeffrey; Taylor, Addison; Verburg, Kenneth M; Lefkowith, James B; Whelton, Andrew","Nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to attenuate the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors with a mean increase in systolic blood pressure (BP) of 5 to 10 mm Hg. Less is known about the specific cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors that are now widely used to treat arthritis. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of celecoxib compared to placebo on 24-hour blood pressure levels in hypertensive patients treated with ACE inhibitors. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical study in 178 men and women (mean age 53 years) with essential hypertension treated and controlled with lisinopril monotherapy (10 to 40 mg daily). Baseline BP values were obtained using 24 hour ambulatory recordings. Patients received either celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily (twice the recommended dose for osteoarthritis) (n=91) or placebo (n=87) for 4 weeks and changes in 24-hour blood pressure, body weight and clinical laboratory parameters were assessed became. The mean changes from baseline in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 2.6/1.5 +/- 0.9/0.6 mm Hg for celecoxib versus 1.0/0.3 +/- 1/ 0.6 mm Hg on placebo (P=0.34 for systolic blood pressure; P=0.45 for diastolic blood pressure). The proportion of patients whose 24-hour blood pressure increased by at least 5, 10, 15, or 20 mmHg was also similar between celecoxib and placebo. There were no changes in body weight, serum creatinine, or potassium in either group. Thus, these data indicate that high doses of celecoxib have no significant effect on the antihypertensive effect of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. The changes observed in 24-hour blood pressure (1.6/1.2 mmHg) subtracted for placebo are less than those reported for nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients treated with ACE inhibitors.",0,0
946,11967807,The combination of non-hypotonic doses of valsartan and enalapril improves survival in spontaneously hypertensive rats with endothelial dysfunction.,,"de Gasparo, M; Hess, P; Nuesslein-Hildesheim, B; Bruneval, P; Clozel, J P","There is increasing evidence that endothelial dysfunction is a critical factor in vascular disease. Genetically predisposed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors develop severe hypertensive nephrosclerosis without the need for surgical reduction of renal mass, nephrectomy, renal infarction, or nephrotoxic drugs. In these animals, endothelial dysfunction is considered a valid model for evaluating the effectiveness of cardiovascular therapy. SHR were treated with either the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril or the angiotensin II (Ang II) AT(1) receptor antagonist (AIIA) valsartan at subhypotensive doses and the effects on survival, cardiac and renal changes were monitored. Rats treated with valsartan alone or in combination with enalapril showed significantly higher survival rates (67-85% each) than untreated animals (37%) or those treated with enalapril alone (55%). Valsartan at a dose that suppressed the increase in blood pressure resulted in even higher survival rates (95%). Despite these improved survival rates, at non-hypotensive doses, the drugs had no effect on histologic appearance, nor did renal function improve. Plasma creatinine levels were reduced by valsartan alone or in combination with enalapril, but proteinuria persisted with all treatments through the 12 weeks of the study. Aldosterone levels were significantly reduced by all treatments. The results suggest a beneficial role for the endothelium in hypertension. The reduced renal perfusion pressure probably underlies the beneficial renal effects of high-dose valsartan.",0,0

The effects of ACE-I on the various components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) during the eclipse hours were studied in patients with diabetes mellitus who received long-term treatment with ACE-I.; Of 86 type 1 and type 2 diabetics, 49 remained untreated, 25 received captopril and 12 received enalapril as maintenance treatment. Blood for determination of plasma renin activity (PRA), serum ACE activity and plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) was collected in the morning (0700-0900) after an overnight fast approximately 12 hours after the last dose. PRA and Ang II were measured by RIA and serum ACE activity was tested by radiometric assay using (3)H-hippuryl-glycyl-glycine as substrate; The mean age was significantly higher in the patients treated with enalapril. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not differ between the captopril-treated and untreated groups. The serum ACE activity in the captopril-treated diabetics was 101.5 +/- 42.5 nmol/ml/min, values obtained in untreated diabetic patients (101.4 +/- 25.2 nmol/ml/ minutes). In contrast, ACE activity was significantly reduced in enalapril-treated patients (5.5 +/- 7.5 nmol/ml/min) compared to untreated and captopril-treated patients (p<0.00001) . The PRA values in the patients treated with ACE-I were significantly increased. Plasma Ang II levels were significantly increased in captopril-treated patients compared to untreated patients (65.1 +/- 50.2 versus 36.2 +/- 31.7 pg/mL, p=0.006 ), while the values in the patients treated with enalapril decreased slightly but not significantly (23.8 +/- 21.4 pg/ml).

Imidapril enhanced the FBF response to reactive hyperemia after 24 weeks of treatment in the mild and moderate hypertensive groups but not in the severe hypertensive group Imidapril was significantly greater in the moderate hypertensive group than in the mild hypertensive group. Amlodipine did not alter the FBF response to reactive hyperemia. The increase in FBF after sublingual nitroglycerin was similar in all groups. The infusion of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine , a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, eliminated the amplification of reactive hyperemia e treated with imidapril for mild and moderate hypertension ups.

949,11975824,Lercanidipine: a novel dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.,,"Epstein, M","Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have been used to treat hypertension for more than 20 years, and recent clinical studies support the efficacy and safety of long-acting dihydropyridine (DHP) CCBs for a broad spectrum of hypertensive patients, including diabetic hypertensive patients. DHP CCBs are overall effective agents and are particularly effective when used in combination with other agents. Lercanidipine is a novel DHP CCB effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. Compared to other DHP-CCBs, lercanidipine has a molecular design that confers greater solubility within the arterial cell membrane bilayer, membrane-controlled kinetics, and a high cholesterol tolerance factor. These favorable membrane-controlled kinetics confer a gradual onset of vasodilation and a long duration of action. In addition, the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of lercanidipine appear to contribute to its efficacy and favorable safety profile. In clinical trials for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, lercanidipine was given at a starting dose of 10 mg once daily and increased to 20 mg once daily in patients who did not respond. Studies have shown that lercanidipine has a 24-hour blood pressure lowering effect and does not cause a significant increase in heart rate. Lercanidipine has been shown to be effective in a wide range of hypertensive patients including mild to moderate hypertension, severe hypertension, the elderly and patients with isolated systolic hypertension. It is associated with a low rate of adverse events. Because of its efficacy and favorable safety profile, lercanidipine has the potential to improve blood pressure control in a wide range of patients, including those who have failed or are intolerant to other antihypertensive drugs.",0,0

Some pitfalls in measuring neonatal glomerular filtration rate, mainly caused by postnatal fluctuations in serum creatinine levels, are highlighted. The serum creatinine levels correlate with the authors' recent finding of tubular reabsorption of creatinine in the immature neonatal kidney. Kidney malformations in preterm and newborn babies have been shown to be linked to serious medical problems in adulthood, including high blood pressure. This realization presents the pediatrician with a new role in the time-honored vocation of preventing disease. Mutations in multiple genes can account for most cases of congenital or hereditary kidney abnormalities. Two renal disorders, congenital nephrotic syndrome and acute neonatal renal failure, and one form of neonatal treatment, renal replacement therapy, are discussed in detail. These conditions are rare in general pediatric practice but illustrate some of the recent developments in neonatal renal care. Caution is advised when using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during pregnancy and the neonatal period. All NSAIDs administered indirectly to the unborn fetus and directly to the young newborn adversely affect renal structure (foetus) and function (both fetus and newborn).

Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are commonly used as antihypertensive drugs and have recently been suggested to reduce the risk of cancer. Studies have shown that an ACE inhibitor, perindopril, is a potent inhibitor of experimental tumor development and angiogenesis at a clinically comparable dose. The potent angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is significantly suppressed by perindopril and also inhibits VEGF-induced tumor growth.

This effect is believed to be essential for the detection of renovascular hypertension by captopril renography. In this study, renographic changes induced by captopril and the AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan in patients with a high probability of renovascular hypertension were compared. 25 patients with 33 stenosed renal arteries (degree of stenosis > 50%) and high blood pressure were examined. Captopril, valsartan and baseline renography were performed within 48 h using technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine. Blood pressure was monitored, plasma renin concentration before and after the procedure was determined, and urinary flow was estimated from the urinary output of the hydrated patients. Post-intervention renographic tracing changes were assessed according to the Santa Fe consensus on ACE inhibitor renography. Captopril renography was positive, indicating renovascular hypertension, in 25 of the 33 stenosed vessels, while valsartan renography was positive in only ten. Blood pressure during captopril and valsartan renography was not different; Blood pressure reduction was the same after valsartan and captopril. Plasma renin concentration was comparable for valsartan and captopril studies and showed suppressed values in as many as 12 of the 25 patients after the intervention. Urinary flow after valsartan was higher than after captopril (p<0.05). However, this difference could not explain the significantly higher sensitivity of captopril compared to valsartan in the detection of renal artery stenosis. In 14 of the 25 patients, blood pressure response to revascularization was monitored, showing a much better predictive value for captopril renography. It is concluded that captopril renography is much more sensitive than valsartan renography in detecting clinically significant renal artery stenosis. In addition, our data suggest that other effects, such as those on the prostaglandin-bradykinin system, are at least as important as ACE inhibition for the high diagnostic sensitivity of captopril renography for renovascular hypertension.",0,0

Forty-one patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction were randomly assigned to either the perindopril group (n=21, perindopril 4 mg/day) or the placebo group (n=20). During cardiac catheterization, plasma levels of aldosterone and ACE activity were measured in the anterior interventricular vein, coronary sinus, and aortic root. Both aldosterone levels and ACE activity were significantly higher at the anterior interventricular vein and coronary sinus than at the aortic root in the placebo group (aldosterone: 92.1 +/- 9.0 vs. 70.6 +/- 8.3 pg/ml [p<0.001], 90.3 +/- 9.2 vs. 70.6 +/- 8.3 pg/ml [p<0.001], ACE activity: 13.6 +/- 0, 8 vs 12.2 +/- 0.7 IU/L [p<0.001], 13.4 +/- 0.8 vs 12.2 +/- 0.7 IU/L [p<0.001]) .

Both aldosterone levels and ACE activity at the anterior interventricular vein and coronary sinus were significantly lower in the perindopril group than in the placebo group. The difference in aldosterone levels between the anterior interventricular vein and the aortic root (delta aldosterone [anterior interventricular vein - aortic root]) was significantly positively correlated with ACE activity (delta ACE [anterior interventricular vein - aortic root]) (r=0.536, p< 0.001), whereas ACE activity in the aortic root did not significantly correlate with either aortic root aldosterone levels or delta aldosterone (anterior interventricular vein - aortic root). Perindopril suppressed cardiac aldosterone production mainly by suppressing cardiac ACE activity in patients with heart failure.

After the initial washout period, patients were evaluated at the end of weeks 4, 8, and 10 of randomized treatment with valsartan and lisinopril, at the end of the first crossover period, and then at the beginning and end of the second crossover period. At each visit, seated and standing blood pressure was measured using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer.; The addition of indomethacin weakened the antihypertensive effect of both antihypertensive drugs. Although indomethacin produced a greater increase in both systolic and DBP in lisinopril-treated patients (5.45/3.22 mmHg) than in valsartan-treated patients (2.12/1.87 mmHg), none was observed significant difference noted between the two drugs.; From a theoretical perspective, these findings suggest that prostaglandins may play a role in the antihypertensive effects of Ang II antagonists.

In ASA-treated and placebo-treated patients: (1) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values achieved with antihypertensive treatment overlapped with clinically irrelevant differences; (2) these superimposable SBP and DBP were achieved with antihypertensive therapies that were quantitatively and qualitatively similar, and (3) changes in serum creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance and the number of patients who developed renal dysfunction were also similar. In addition, the cardiovascular benefits of ASA were of the same order of magnitude in hypertensive patients receiving or not receiving ACE inhibitors.; Even long-term, low-dose therapy with ASA does not impair the blood pressure-lowering effect of antihypertensive drugs, including combinations with ACE inhibitors, or renal function. There is no negative interaction between ACE inhibition and the cardiovascular benefits of a small dose of ASA.

Blood pressure was measured using validated semi-automated devices at both the end of the washout and treatment periods.; A total of 590 patients took part in the study. Compliance data could be evaluated for 501 patients. Overall compliance, defined as the ratio of the number of opens registered to the number of doses prescribed, was less than 80, 80-100, and greater than 100% in 17, 63, and 20% of patients, respectively. The mean number (+/- SD) missed doses was 4.5 +/- 8 (median 2). The mean interval between consecutive openings was 25 h 07 min, mean +/- 13 h (median 24 h). The mean number of delayed doses (a delayed dose is defined as opening the box 25-36 h after the previous opportunity) was 5.6 +/- 3 (median 6).

Recent advances in molecular cloning have led to the characterization of many of these transport systems. These advances have enabled the identification of a number of drugs that are substrates for the transporters and have facilitated studies of the mechanisms of drug-induced cholestasis. This review article summarizes the normal function of hepatobiliary transporters and their alteration by drugs or other foreign substances. Although most of these studies have been performed in animal models of drug-induced cholestasis, application to human forms of drug-induced cholestasis is also discussed where possible. An important finding is that genetic polymorphisms can result in alterations in the expression and function of drug transporters that could increase susceptibility to cholestatic drug reactions.",0,0

There are no large placebo-controlled trials of these drugs. The second Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly Trial (ELITE-II) compared the ARB of losartan to captopril in 3,152 patients ≥ 60 years of age with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV and left ventricular ejection fraction </= 40% and could fail to demonstrate the efficacy of the ARB or its angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor equivalent. The Valsartan Heart Failure Study was designed to determine whether the addition of valsartan improved outcomes in patients receiving standard heart failure therapy, which in most cases included an ACE inhibitor.; A total of 5,010 patients with NYHA Class II-IV CHF and an ejection fraction <40% received valsartan 160 mg twice daily or placebo. The 2 co-primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and composite mortality-morbidity, defined as the incidence of heart failure hospitalizations, resuscitated sudden death, or receipt of at least 4 hours of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator therapy (where hospitalizations account for 94% of non-fatal endpoints) . Mortality was similar in the two groups, but the combined mortality and morbidity endpoint was 13.2% lower with valsartan (relative risk 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.97; P. 009), mainly due to a reduction in the number of patients hospitalized for CHF (13.8% vs. 18.2%). There were improvements in multiple secondary endpoints including ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of CHF, and quality of life with valsartan. Of note, analyzes of subgroups defined according to background therapy at baseline revealed highly significant interactions. For example, the small subgroup of 366 patients (7%) not receiving ACE inhibitors had a 33% reduction in mortality and a 44% reduction in both mortality and morbidity, while maintaining the morbidity and mortality benefit of valsartan throughout the study was observed no longer significantly in patients receiving background therapy with ACE inhibitors (relative risk, 0.90; P.10). The larger subset of patients who received both an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker at baseline had a statistically significant 42% increase in mortality with valsartan (P.009) and a trend for an increase in combined mortality and morbidity ( P.10). .; When added to standard therapy, valsartan has no overall effect on mortality and results in a modest (13.2%) reduction in morbidity and mortality. However, this benefit is much greater in patients not receiving concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy and is not statistically significant in patients taking ACE inhibitors. Somewhat worrying is the finding of a significant increase in mortality with valsartan in patients receiving both ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker therapy.",0,0

Clinical and other laboratory investigations including echocardiographic parameters were noted and meticulously recorded within 24-48 hours after AMI and repeated at week 4. The present study, which is based on non-invasive methods other than hemodynamic methods, has shown that the echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function parameters after 4 weeks of ACE inhibitor therapy (n = 100) was better in the treated group than in the control group without ACE inhibitors (n=80) and the difference was statistically significant at the 99% confidence level. The all-cause mortality was 4% in the ACE inhibitor group and 8.75% in the control group. This short-term study of early intervention with ACE inhibitors within 48 hours of AMI provided statistically significant evidence for the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors in improving ventricular function parameters and also in reducing short-term mortality from cardiac causes within 4 weeks compared to the group that received no treatment shown ACE inhibitors.",1,0

It appears to be autoantibody mediated and is not dose dependent. Spontaneous and complete skin healing follows cessation of vancomycin; Rechallenge reproduces the disease with a faster and more severe onset. As vancomycin is almost never suspected to be the cause of such manifestations, awareness of this rare autoimmune reaction is crucial.

It also looks at how insights into the reasons for non-compliance can help us design more effective treatments and discusses current and emerging medications related to compliance.

Data from these studies are summarized in this article.; The literature shows that patients with primary respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD are not at increased risk of developing cough or bronchoconstriction as a result of ACE inhibitor therapy. Despite the ability of ACE inhibitors to improve exercise tolerance, blood flow, and gas transfer, patients with CHF may be at greater risk of developing cough than the general population.

ALLHAT was a large, simple study designed to closely mimic clinical practice as seen in high-risk hypertensive patients aged 55 years and older. The aim was to determine whether the incidence of the primary endpoint - a composite of fatal coronary artery disease and non-fatal myocardial infarction - differed between treatment with a diuretic (chlortalidone) (12.5-25.0 mg/day) and treatment with either distinguished from three other types of antihypertensive drugs - a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril) and a peripheral alpha-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin) (2-8 mg/day). Doxazosin was recently withdrawn from this study after an interim analysis showed that the secondary endpoint of composite cardiovascular disease was 25% higher in patients treated with doxazosin than in patients assigned to treatment with chlorthalidone. This finding was largely caused by congestive heart failure. The practicing clinician should not abandon doxazosin entirely because of the ALLHAT findings, although these findings are undeniably important.

986,12062731,The liver and lovastatin.,,"Tolman, Keith G","Cholesterol-lowering drugs, so-called statins, have been in use for 15 years and are among the most frequently prescribed drugs. Animal and pre-marketing clinical studies have indicated evidence of hepatotoxicity, mainly minor elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase enzyme (ALT) levels. For this reason, all cholesterol-lowering drugs have a label that requires monitoring of liver enzymes. However, post-marketing experience suggests that hepatotoxicity is rare and it is time to revisit the issue. The first of the statins, lovastatin, was approved in 1986 and has over 24 million patient-years of clinical experience. Minor elevations in liver enzymes, ie ALT 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN), occur in 2.6% and 5.0% of patients on lovastatin doses of 20 and 80 mg/day, respectively. These increases are reversible with continued therapy, are dose dependent, and are likely related to the lowering of cholesterol itself. Rare cases of acute liver failure (ALF) have been reported with all cholesterol-lowering medicinal products. For lovastatin, the rate is approximately 1/1.14 million patient-years of treatment, which is 9% of the background rate of all causes of ALF and approximately equal to the background rate of idiopathic ALF. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity has not been effective in preventing severe liver disease, mainly due to its rarity and poor predictive value of low-grade ALT elevations. In fact, it may increase patient risk by unnecessarily stopping cholesterol-lowering therapy in the case of false-positive results in patients who benefit from the treatment.",0,0

The effects of these drugs on blood pressure, heart rate, kidney function and serum electrolytes, as well as their efficacy and tolerability in combination with digoxin were also examined. This study was conducted at the Medical Department of Main Alexandria University Hospital in Alexandria, Egypt, during the period from May 1999 to May 2000.; Diltiazem caused a significant increase in peak digoxin serum concentrations with no significant change in time to peak concentration and apparent volume of distribution. The total clearance of digoxin was significantly reduced and the elimination half-life was prolonged. Subsequently, the area under the time-concentration curve and steady-state digoxin levels were increased but still within the therapeutic limit. On the other hand, isosorbide dinitrate significantly increased the maximum serum concentration of digoxin, but without altering the other pharmacokinetic parameters of digoxin. Isosorbide dinitrate, but not diltiazem, caused significant reductions in supine and standing blood pressure, while both drugs did not significantly alter pulse rate, renal function, serum sodium-potassium, and electrocardiographic patterns.; Patients receiving diltiazem had a mean increase in area under the plasma concentration-time curve of 51%, a 50% increase in mean steady-state serum digoxin concentration, and a 37% increase in peak serum digoxin concentration. In contrast, patients receiving isosorbide dinitrate had only a 15% increase in peak serum digoxin concentration and no statistically significant change in mean steady-state digoxin concentration or area under the plasma concentration-time curve. The elimination half-life during the diltiazem phase was prolonged by 29%, while there was no significant change with isosorbide dinitrate. Neither diltiazem nor isosorbide dinitrate significantly altered the time to reach peak serum digoxin concentration. Adding a vasodilator such as diltiazem or isosorbide dinitrate to digoxin could significantly improve heart failure symptoms and signs compared to digoxin alone. They were well tolerated and without fear of electrolyte imbalance that potentiates digoxin toxicity.",0,0

This large practice-based clinical study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose combination therapy with amlodipine/benazepril compared to amlodipine monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.; Hypertensive patients currently taking amlodipine were selected based on one of two criteria: inadequate blood pressure (BP) control on amlodipine (diastolic BP [DBP] > or = 90 mmHg; Group 1) or inability to tolerate amlodipine (DBP < or = 90 mm Hg, but with edema; group 2). Eligible patients were switched from 5 or 10 mg amlodipine to 5/10 mg or 5/20 mg amlodipine/benazepril for 4 weeks. In Group 1 (n=6410), the primary efficacy endpoint was change in mean seated DBP. A secondary efficacy endpoint was change in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP). In Group 2 (n=1502), the primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients whose edema improved during therapy with amlodipine/benazepril compared to amlodipine monotherapy; In Group 1, mean seated DBP decreased from 96.5 mmHg at baseline to 84.9 mmHg at week 4, a mean reduction of 11.5 mmHg (95% confidence interval [CI] -11.8 to -11.3 mmHg ;P<0.001) .

A total of 25 other subjects received lisinopril as an active control. Omapatrilat (40 mg) produced sustained blood pressure (BP) control (as determined by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements) that was significantly better than that achieved by lisinopril 20 mg daily. The antihypertensive response to both drugs was accompanied by a similar sustained inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme activity. Plasma levels of angiotensin I (Ang I), angiotensin II (Ang II), and Ang-(1-7) were not altered by treatment with omapatrilat or lisinopril, although both regimens produced a slight increase in plasma renin activity. In contrast, the urinary excretion rates of Ang I and Ang-(1-7), but not Ang II, increased significantly throughout the dosing period of patients administered omapatrilat, while contrasting the lesser antihypertensive response elicited by lisinopril , had a smaller and transient effect on increasing urinary excretion rates of Ang-(1-7). Omapatrilat, a single molecule that inhibits neutral endopeptidase and simultaneously converts enzyme, controlled salt-sensitive hypertension through a mechanism associated with a sustained increase in urinary Ang (1-7) excretion. We propose that Ang-(1-7) may be a component of the mechanism by which omapatrilat induces an antihypertensive response in salt-sensitive hypertension.",0,0

At 24 weeks, patients randomized to omapatrilat had a significant reduction in the composite endpoint of death, hospitalization, or study drug discontinuation for worsening heart failure compared to patients randomized to lisinopril. They also had significantly fewer major cardiac adverse events.; The purpose of this study was to determine the economic consequences of lower event rates in patients administered omapatrilat.; Economic outcomes (greater hospital stays and associated medical costs) were compared between treatment groups and assessed from the societal perspective. Information on hospitalization was obtained from the standardized case report and serious adverse event forms of the IMPRESS study. Hospital costs were assessed by assigning each hospital admission a diagnosis-related group and an average cost of physician and hospital services. Visits to the emergency department were only included if they were for worsening heart failure, and they were assigned a cost equal to the average hospital and physician Medicare reimbursement for those visits in Duke University Medical Center's heart failure program. Drug costs were not evaluated.; Although the typical patient was event-free in both treatment groups, there was a trend toward a greater number of hospitalizations in patients receiving lisinopril than in patients receiving omapatrilat (p=0.07). The differences in the distribution of cardiac hospitalizations between patients receiving lisinopril and patients receiving omapatrilat were significant (p=0.03). There was a trend toward lower medical costs at 24 weeks in patients receiving omapatrilat compared to patients receiving lisinopril ($1930 vs. $2002, P=0.09). When considering only cardiac costs, this trend toward lower medical costs was significant ($1,240 vs. $1,442, P=0.03).; After 24 weeks, heart failure patients treated with omapatrilat had fewer hospital admissions and lower medical costs than patients treated with lisinopril.

The study enrolled 82 type 1 diabetics with progressive diabetic nephropathy [mean decrease in pre-study glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 7.1 mL/min/year (95% CI, 5.8 to 8.5)]. The main outcome parameters were a decrease in GFR and the development of ESRD or death.; During the follow-up period, the normal protein diet group consumed 1.02 g/kg/day (95% CI; 0.95 to 1.10) compared to 0.89 (0.83 to 0.95) in the group with low protein diet (p=0.005).

Patients were weaned 1 to 2 weeks prior to initiation of antihypertensive medication and systolic pressure was confirmed to be > or = 160 mm Hg. Pulsatile hemodynamics were assessed before randomization and at 12 weeks using calibrated tonometry and pulsed Doppler. The characteristic impedance (Z(c)), a direct measure of central aortic stiffness, was calculated from the ratio of changes in carotid pressure and aortic flow in early systole.

The survey covers alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists, beta-blockers including topical eye medications, alpha-beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The lack of data on angiotensin II receptor blockers is noted, although it is believed that the effects are similar to those of ACE inhibitors and should therefore be avoided. Analysis of the literature underscores that some antihypertensive drugs are safe to use at certain stages of pregnancy, while others are suspect and should be avoided at all costs. The ethical lack of placebo-controlled studies on the treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy is discussed against the background of the urgent need to treat these women despite possible harmful effects of antihypertensive drugs.",0,0

In heart failure (HF) patients who have ventricular conduction delay, CRT improves systolic hemodynamic function. The clinical utility of CRT is still under investigation.; Forty-one patients were randomized to 4 weeks of initial treatment with either biventricular or univentricular pacing, followed by 4 weeks of no treatment, and then 4 weeks of a second treatment of the opposite pacing. The best CRT stimulation was continued for nine months. Cardiac resynchronization therapy has been optimized through hemodynamic testing at implant. The primary endpoints were measurements of physical capacity. Data were analyzed by two-way repeated measures analysis of variance.; In 36 patients, the left ventricle was selected for univentricular pacing. The clinical effects of univentricular and biventricular CRT were not significantly different. The results of each method were pooled to assess the impact of sequential treatment. Oxygen uptake during cycling exercise increased from 9.48 to 10.4 mL/kg/min at anaerobic threshold (p = 0.03) and from 12.5 to 14.3 mL/kg/min at maximal exercise (p < 0.001) at the first treatment and from 10.0 to 10.7 ml/kg/min at the anaerobic threshold (p = 0.2) and from 13.4 to 15.2 ml/kg/min at maximal exercise (p = 0.002) at the second treatment.

The design was prospective, randomized, controlled, of parallel branches and was performed in a department of endocrinology in Spain. 77 type II diabetics with stable albuminuria (30-1,000 mg/day) were included. After a pre-inclusion period of 2 weeks, patients were randomized to verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 (VT) or losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (LH) 20/12.5 mg/day. The duration of treatment was 1 year. The evaluated parameters were changes in blood pressure, albumin excretion in urine for 24 hours, glycated hemoglobin and plasma urea.

LVMI was measured by echocardiogram at baseline and at 1 and 7 years. Renal function was assessed by measuring serum creatinine and 24-hour creatinine clearance every 6 months for 3 years and then annually for an additional 4 years. Baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups. During the study, the mean mean arterial pressure was 90 +/- 5 mmHg for the rigorous group and 101 +/- 4 mmHg for the standard group (P < 0.0001). The LVMI decreased by 21% in the standard group and by 35% in the strict group. A longitudinal mixed-model analysis of data revealed that strict blood pressure control was significantly more effective in lowering LVMI (P<0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in renal function between the two groups. In conclusion, left ventricular hypertrophy, an important cardiovascular risk factor, was reduced significantly more by rigorous blood pressure control than by standard blood pressure control. This finding is of particular clinical importance as cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of death in ADPKD patients.",0,0

C administration was started during the first 4 days of AMI (mean 21 +/- 24 h). 50 C-treated patients and a control group of 43 patients were finally analyzed. C doses were increased stepwise from 3.125 mg tid on day 1 to 25 mg tid on day 4. A significant decrease in sBP after C-dose was observed 60 and 120 min after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd dose on day 1 and 30-120 min after the first C-dose on day 4. dBP decreased only 60-120 min after the 1st dose on day 1 and 90 min after the first dose on day 4. Hypotension after the 1st and 2nd C doses on day 1 led to the exclusion of 3 patients (6%) from the study.

In conclusion, there is an association between DEATH and endothelial damage/dysfunction in hypertension. Intensified management leads to improvements in hemorheology, endothelial and platelet function.",0,0

Randomized trials evaluating first-line therapy with thiazides, beta-adrenergic antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers, centrally acting agents, or angiotensin II receptor antagonists were reviewed.; Health outcomes considered were changes in blood pressure, cardiovascular morbidity, and cardiovascular and/or all-cause mortality rates. Economic results were not considered due to insufficient evidence.; MEDLINE was searched from March 1999 to October 2001 to identify studies that were not included in the 2000 revision of the Canadian Recommendations for the Management of Hypertension. Reference lists were searched, experts interviewed, and the personal files of subgroup members and authors used to identify other published studies. All relevant articles were reviewed by content experts and methodological experts and rated using specified levels of evidence.; A high priority was given to avoiding cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.; Various antihypertensive drugs lower blood pressure in patients with persistent high blood pressure. In certain settings and for certain classes of drugs, lowering blood pressure has been associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity and/or mortality.; This document provides detailed recommendations regarding treatment thresholds, target blood pressures, and drug choice in different settings in patients with hypertension. The main changes from the 2000 recommendations are the addition of a section on the management of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus, the merging of the previous sections on the management of hypertension in young and old into one section, a greater emphasis on the role of Combination therapies versus repeated single attempts and expansion of the treatment of post-stroke hypertension section. Inherent in the treatment recommendations is the principle that global cardiovascular risk, the presence and/or absence of target organ damage and comorbidities should be considered when treating an individual patient.; All recommendations were ranked by strength of evidence and voted on by the Canadian Hypertension Recommendations Working Group. Individuals with potential conflicts of interest in relation to a particular recommendation have been excluded from voting on that recommendation.

1011,12109041,From toxic raw materials to safe drugs. Mechanisms and relevance of idiosyncratic drug reactions.,,"Petersen, Karl-Uwe","In the case of adverse drug reactions, effects attributable to the drug's pharmacological profile can be distinguished from sometimes bizarre, unpredictable events (""idiosyncrasies""). The latter are in the majority of cases due to reactive intermediates formed by members of the cytochrome P450 enzyme family. These products are usually formed in very small amounts. However, genetic disposition (e.g. increased expression of the catalysing enzyme or lack of protective factors such as glutathione) or certain external conditions (e.g. co-medication with inducers of drug metabolism) can result in toxic intermediates being available in relevant amounts. Once generated, these metabolites react with macromolecules and eventually cause cell necrosis. Necrosis can result from direct damage to functions essential to the cell or secondary to deleterious immune responses activated by recognition of the new structures as neoantigens. As the main site of drug metabolism, the liver is most frequently affected by idiosyncratic reactions, which are often only recognized after treatment of a large number of patients. The idiosyncratic potential of a drug relates to its chemical structure rather than its pharmacological mechanism. Risks are evident when biotransformation produces products with chemical substructures such as quinones, phenols, acyl halides, aromatic and hydroxylamines. There are numerous cases of precursors with idiosyncratic potential that have been replaced or marginalized by drugs with more favorable chemistry. Examples include beta-1 preferential beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (toxic precursor: practolol) and the cholinesterase inhibitors used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In the latter group, tacrine (CAS 321-64-2) leads to high liver enzyme levels in about 30% of patients, an effect not shared with newer, chemically distinct agents. The same applies to the insulin sensitizer troglitazone (CAS 97322-87-7) (marketed in the US, now withdrawn) and its successors rosiglitazone (CAS 122320-73-4) and pioglitazone (CAS 111025-46-8) . Because of its different chemical structure, only troglitazone can be converted to a reactive quinone metabolite, a process that can be accelerated by the drug inducing its own metabolism. Consistent with this view, there is no evidence of specific hepatotoxicity of the two follow-on drugs. Ongoing advances in molecular toxicology can help minimize idiosyncratic hazards early in drug development.",0,0

However, it is not known whether quitting smoking slows this accelerated loss of kidney function. 45 patients with progressive primary nephropathy (glomerulonephritis or tubulointerstitial nephritis) and moderate renal impairment were encouraged to quit heavy smoking (1-2 packs per day); 26 patients refused to change their smoking habits (current smokers) and 16 successfully quit (ex-smokers) during the 24-month study period. Carboxyhemoglobin and creatinine clearance were measured every six months. The primary endpoint of the study was end-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy.; At baseline, there were no significant differences between the two patient groups in demographic, renal, and treatment characteristics. Current and ex-smokers had similar rates of decrease in creatinine clearance in the 24 months prior to the studies. Compared to ex-smokers or corresponding non-smoking kidney patients, long-term smokers experienced a significantly faster drop in creatinine clearance during the two-year study period. Renal replacement therapy had to be started in six smokers, but only in one ex-smoker and none of the non-smokers during the study period.; Quitting smoking slowed the rapid progression of kidney failure but did not reverse the loss of kidney function caused by smoking.

This is thought to be related to an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, resulting in reduced heart rate variability (HRV). In non-diabetic patients, decreased HRV is known to be a strong predictor of cardiovascular death. Studies in non-diabetic patients have shown that beta-blockers improve HRV parameters known to reflect parasympathetic function. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of add-on beta-blocker treatment on: cardiac autonomic function, blood pressure, and urinary albumin excretion in ACE inhibitor-treated (insulin-dependent) type 1 diabetic patients with abnormal albuminuria.; We evaluated the effects of 6 weeks of treatment with metoprolol (100 mg once daily, zero-order kinetic formulation) in 20 patients participating in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study. Patients were simultaneously monitored under ambulatory conditions with 24-h Holter monitoring, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurement, and 24-h fractionated urine collection. Heart rate variability was assessed using four different methods; Ambulatory HRV analysis was performed using spectral and time domain analysis, and short-term spectral analysis and bedside testing were performed on study days.; Treatment with metoprolol improved vagal tone assessed by short-term spectral analysis. 24-hour ambulatory HRV analysis showed improvement in some parameters reflecting vagus function. A slight decrease in diurnal diastolic blood pressure was shown, no changes in diurnal variation in blood pressure or urinary albumin excretion were observed.; These preliminary results indicate that beta-blocker treatment may improve autonomic function in type 1 diabetics with abnormal albuminuria and an associated high risk of cardiovascular disease.",0,0

However, the criteria used to define deteriorating renal function are arbitrary, and the implications of differing definitions remain unclear. We therefore compared the prognostic significance of different definitions of renal deterioration in 1,002 patients hospitalized for congestive heart failure (CHF).; The patient population was 49% female aged 67 +/- 15 years. 23% had a history of renal failure, 73% had depressed ejection fraction, and 63% had known CHF. On admission to the hospital, 47% were receiving ACE inhibitors, 22% beta-blockers, 70% diuretics, and 6% NAIDs. 72% developed elevated serum creatinine during the hospital stay, 20% developed an elevation > or = 0.5 mg/dL. Worsening renal function predicted both in-hospital mortality and length of stay > 10 days. Even an elevated creatinine of 0.1 mg/dL was associated with a poorer outcome. Sensitivity to death decreased from 92% to 65% when the threshold for elevated creatinine was raised from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/dL, with specificity increasing from 28% to 81%. At a threshold of 0.3 mg/dl increase, sensitivity was 81% and specificity 62% for death and 64% and 65% for length of stay > 10 days. Adding a final creatinine requirement of > or = 1.5 mg/dL improved specificity.; This analysis shows that any detectable decrease in kidney function is associated with increased mortality and longer hospital stays.

Patients were treated at 659 hospitals, 22 of which also participated in SAVE. A third of the patients were enrolled after SAVE was published in 1992. The primary outcome was the use of an ACE inhibitor at discharge. We analyzed the data using hierarchical models and multivariate regression.; Patients treated at sites that participated in SAVE were no more likely to be receiving an ACE inhibitor at discharge than patients treated at non-SAVE sites (226/1415 [16%] vs. 3671/ 24,471 [15%]; odds ratio [OR] = 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.8 to 1.4; P = 0.67).

ACE inhibitor use increased after the publication of the SAVE study, but again, there was no significant difference in drug adoption between SAVE and non-SAVE sites.; Sites that participated in SAVE did not use ACE inhibitors more frequently in patients with myocardial infarction than sites that did not participate.

The authors studied 89 Caribbean hypertensive patients who participated in six double-blind, randomized antihypertensive drug trials. Demographics, laboratory data, sodium excretion, plasma renin activity and atrial natriuretic peptide were obtained after 3-4 weeks on placebo. Blood pressure responses to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and fixed combinations of ACE inhibitors and HCTZ were compared to placebo after 8-12 weeks of treatment. The patients had a multiple risk factor profile (obesity and diabetes) and a broad spectrum of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and hypertensive kidney damage. Urinary sodium excretion rates revealed inability to maintain salt restriction in 65% of patients. Plasma renin activity was lower than that of Hispanic normotensive controls, and 62% of patients had low-renin essential hypertension as assessed by renin profiling for sodium excretion. On analysis of variance, the blood pressure reductions from calcium channel blockers, HCTZ, and ACE inhibitor/HCTZ combinations were significantly greater than those from placebo, while those from ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers monotherapy were not. The authors conclude that essential hypertension in Caribbean Hispanics is associated with multiple risk factors and is mostly of the low-renin type. Responses to therapy are consistent with those observed in other populations with a low-renin phenotype and suggest blood pressure salt sensitivity in this population. Confirmation of the latter has implications for the prevention and treatment of essential hypertension in Hispanics.",0,0

Patients who started on AIIRA irbesartan performed best with a persistence rate of 60.8%, followed by patients who received all other AIIRA active substances with a persistence rate of 51.3%. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and losartan were associated with comparable persistence rates ranging from 42.0% to 49.7%. Patients receiving diuretics performed worst, with a persistence rate of 34.4%. Persistence has become an essential factor in blood pressure control. Prescribing an antihypertensive drug that offers a favorable efficacy and tolerability profile may allow for a longer duration of therapy and thus better blood pressure control.",0,0
1028,12149667,Autonomous heart tone during low-dose trandolapril-irbesartan combination therapy for hypertension: a pilot project.,,"Franchi, F; Lazzeri, C; Foschi, M; Tosti-Guerra, C; Barletta, G","Pharmacological and clinical studies on the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors support the idea of a central role for angiotensin II, which can also cause cardiovascular and kidney diseases independently of its blood pressure-increasing effect. The present investigation aimed to evaluate the effect(s) of three different pharmacological regimens on both blood pressure and sympathetic drive in uncomplicated essential hypertension using laboratory measurements of blood pressure and ambulatory monitoring, 24-hour heart rate variability, and plasma norepinephrine levels . Thus, ACE inhibitor monotherapy (trandolapril, 2 mg/day), AT(1) receptor antagonist monotherapy (irbesartan, 300 mg/day), their low-dose combination (0.5 mg/day plus 150 mg/day, each) and placebo were administered in a randomized, single-blind, crossover fashion for 3 weeks each to 12 mild essential hypertensive drugs. Power spectral analysis (short recordings) and norepinephrine measurements were also performed in the supine position and after a postural challenge (60 degrees head-up tilt test: HUT). Low-dose combination therapy induced the greatest reduction in LF component and LF/HF ratio in both resting and inclined positions, and blood pressure. However, the physiological autonomic response to HUT was preserved. Plasma norepinephrine levels were lower after the combination therapy than after either drug alone. Our data show that in mild and uncomplicated essential hypertension, chronic low-dose combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and an AT(1) antagonist is more effective in influencing autonomic regulation than the recommended full-dose monotherapy with either cardiac drug , suggesting a relative reduction in sympathetic drive at both the cardiac and systemic levels.",0,0
1029,12152252,The effect of aspirin on the rheological properties of erythrocytes in essential hypertension.,,"Korbut, Renata A; Adamek-Guzik, Teresa","Essential hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Its pathophysiological mechanism is unknown. Recent data suggest that red blood cell deformability and aggregation may play an important role in regulating blood rheology in hypertension. At the same time, there are reports suggesting that the blood pressure lowering effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may be counteracted by high doses of aspirin. We postulate that these effects may be related to changes in blood rheology. Accordingly, we designed a study to evaluate the effect of low or high dose aspirin on the deformability and aggregation ability of red blood cells from patients with essential hypertension. Deformability and aggregation ability of red blood cells were measured with a laser diffractometer (Rheodyn SSD, Myrenne GmbH) and a computer-aided automatic aggregometer (MA1 Myrenne GmbH, Germany), respectively. The effects of aspirin on red blood cell deformability and aggregation were studied ex vivo in whole blood from three groups of patients with essential hypertension (Group I: 10 patients receiving placebo, Group II: 23 patients receiving 75 mg/day aspirin po for 3 days and Group III: 23 patients who received 300 mg/day po aspirin for 3 days). Subjects in all groups received the same combination of antihypertensive drugs consisting of: one of ACEI (enalapril or perindopril), one of beta-antagonists (metoprolol or bisoprolol), and a diuretic (indapamide). In patients receiving a high dose of aspirin (300 mg/day), we observed that erythrocyte aggregability was 25% higher than in the placebo group (MEA = 25.8 +/- 6 SD, vs. MEA = 20.6 +/- 3 SD, p<0.05). Aspirin had no effect on erythrocyte deformability or arterial blood pressure. High doses of aspirin or possibly other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients receiving antihypertensive therapy may directly affect the rheological properties of the blood due to activation of red blood cell aggregation. Increased red blood cell aggregation during antihypertensive therapy can be an important indicator of deterioration in organ perfusion.",0,0

Our aim was to evaluate the association of Amadori albumin with early nephropathy and with retinopathy in patients with type I diabetes and the involvement of chronic mild inflammation.; Amadori albumin, the Amadori product of hemoglobin (HbA1c), C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen levels were measured in the EUCLID study, a 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of lisinopril in 447 type 1 diabetics. Retinal photographs were taken in 341 patients at baseline and 294 at follow-up.; Amadori albumin was positive with albumin excretion rate and retinopathy status (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.02 for trend, respectively) and with progression from normoalbuminuria to (micro)albuminuria (38.6 U ml (-1) in non-progressors, 44.3 U mL-1 in progressors; P=0.02), but not in the development or progression of retinopathy during a 2-year follow-up. Baseline Amadori albumin levels were associated with C-reactive protein and fibrinogen (p=0.0007 and p=0.0001, respectively). C-reactive protein and fibrinogen were also associated with albumin excretion rates (p=0.03 and p=0.01, respectively) and retinopathy status (p=0.02 and p=0.0006, respectively). Adjusting for these inflammatory markers did not appreciably weaken the association between Amadori albumin and albumin excretion rate, while adjusting for fibrinogen but not C-reactive protein abolished the association between Amadori albumin and retinopathy. Lisinopril did not affect the association between Amadori albumin levels and albumin excretion rates or retinopathy.; Amadori albumin was associated with early nephropathy and with retinopathy in patients with type 1 diabetes and preceded an increase in albumin excretion rate but not retinopathy. Chronic mild inflammation does not appear to be involved in Amadori albumin-associated microvascular complications in type 1 diabetes.",0,0

Hypertensive patients (n=341) whose blood pressure (BP) was not controlled despite ACE inhibitors or ARBs were randomized (double-blind) to receive eplerenone 50 mg (increase to 100 mg if needed) once daily or placebo for 8 weeks. Diastolic and systolic blood pressure and adverse events were recorded. At the end of the study (week 8), mean seated diastolic blood pressure from week 0 was (-12.7 +/- 0.81 mm Hg) in patients receiving eplerenone/ARB compared to those receiving placebo/ARB (-9.3 +/- 0.83 mm Hg), significantly reduced ). The change in mean seated diastolic blood pressure was -9.9+/-0.88 mmHg in patients treated with eplerenone/ACE inhibitors and -8.0+/-0.86 mmHg in patients treated with placebo/ACE inhibitors (P =NS). Systolic blood pressure values were also significant at week 8 in patients treated with eplerenone/ACE inhibitors (-13.4 +/- 1.35 mm Hg) and eplerenone/ARB (-16.0 +/- 1.37 mm Hg), respectively lower than placebo/ACE inhibitor patients (-7.5+/-1.31 mmHg) and placebo/ARB patients (-9.2+/-1.41 mmHg). Adverse events were generally not serious and did not differ significantly between eplerenone and placebo. This study showed that in patients whose blood pressure was not controlled with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, the addition of eplerenone for 8 weeks significantly reduced systolic blood pressure in both groups and diastolic blood pressure in ARB patients. Selective aldosterone blockade with eplerenone may therefore be a useful add-on therapy in hypertensive patients inadequately controlled on ACE inhibitors or ARBs alone.",0,0
1032,12160198,Skeletal muscle magnesium content correlates with plasma glucose concentration in patients with essential hypertension treated with lisinopril or bendrofluazide.,,"Haenni, Arvo; Reneland, Rikard; Andersson, Per-Erik; Lind, Lars; Lithell, Hans","The association between a change in glucose metabolism and a change in skeletal muscle magnesium (Mg) concentration induced by antihypertensive treatment was investigated in 37 patients with essential hypertension who were randomly assigned to receive either lisinopril or bendrofluazide. Before and after 6 months of treatment, skeletal muscle biopsies were performed, glucose tolerance was determined by oral (OGTT) and intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT), and insulin sensitivity was determined by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique. An inverse relationship was found between the treatment-induced change in fasting plasma glucose concentration and the change in skeletal muscle Mg concentration (r=−0.39, P<0.05). However, there was no significant correlation between skeletal muscle Mg content and either insulin sensitivity as measured by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp test or glucose tolerance as assessed by IVGTT and OGTT. In conclusion, increased circulating glucose levels correlated with decreased skeletal muscle Mg levels during antihypertensive treatment. However, skeletal muscle Mg concentration did not significantly predict insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance.",0,0
1033,12162469,"double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study of the efficacy and safety of enalapril in children with hypertension.",,"Wells, Thomas; Frame, Virginia; Soffer, Beth; Shaw, Wayne; Zhang, Zhongxin; Herrera, Pamela; Shahinfar, Shahnaz","Despite its widespread use to treat childhood hypertension, enalapril has never been systematically studied to determine its efficacy, dose response, and safety in children and adolescents. This study was conducted prospectively in 110 hypertensive children aged 6 to 16 years in two consecutive phases. The primary outcome variable for both phases of the study was seated diastolic blood pressure (24 hours post-dose). The primary objective of the first phase of the study was to determine whether enalapril reduced blood pressure in children in a dose-dependent manner. During a 2-week, double-blind, randomized, dose-response period, patients were stratified by weight (<50 kg or > or =50 kg) and then assigned to one of three dose groups: low (0.625 or 1.25 mg), medium (2.5 or 5 mg) or high dose (20 or 40 mg). The reduction in blood pressure was examined as a function of the dose ratio (1:4:32) and weight-adjusted. Upon completion of the dose-response phase of the study, patients entered a 2-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal of either enalapril or placebo. Antihypertensive efficacy, defined as the difference in seated diastolic blood pressure between the placebo and enalapril groups, was determined. Adverse events were carefully recorded throughout the study. The dose-response relationship for enalapril had a negative slope and was linear over the chosen dose range, suggesting that higher doses of enalapril were associated with greater reductions in blood pressure. The randomized discontinuation on the active drug or placebo confirmed the antihypertensive efficacy of enalapril in the medium and high dose groups. The blood pressure lowering effect of enalapril was maintained across age, gender, race and Tanner stage. Enalapril appears to be an effective and generally well-tolerated antihypertensive drug in children 6 to 16 years of age. A starting dose of 2.5 mg in children weighing < 50 kg and 5 mg in children weighing > 50 kg (mean = 0.08 mg/kg) given once daily reduced blood pressure in children effective in most patients within 2 weeks. Blood pressure was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, with larger doses leading to greater reductions.",1,0

Up-titration to conventional doses and combination therapy with other antiproteinuric agents may be used to achieve renoprotection in patients at risk of rapid disease progression. The effect of maximum tolerated ACEi doses (ramipril 15 mg/day, range 5 to 20) alone or in combination with indomethacin (75 mg x 2/day) on urinary protein excretion (UPE) and size-selective glomerular barrier function was evaluated in 19 examined patients with chronic non-diabetic nephropathy and persistent proteinuria.; Maximum doses of ramipril lowered RPE more effectively than non-ACEi therapy. The reduction in proteinuria was associated with a significant (>50%) reduction in nonselective glomerular membrane shunting, but did not correlate with concomitant changes in arterial pressure and renal hemodynamics, nor was it affected by treatment duration. The reduction in UPE and sieving coefficient of the major neutral dextrans exceeded the reduction achieved by conventional ACEi doses two-fold in historical controls with similar renal dysfunction and proteinuria previously studied under identical experimental conditions. Indomethacin had no effect on the renal effects of the maximum doses of ramipril and was discontinued early in six patients due to reversible side effects. Serum potassium increased significantly only in combination with indomethacin and never required discontinuation of treatment.; Up-titration to the maximum tolerable doses certainly increases the antiproteinuric effect of ACEi and can serve to achieve maximum renoprotection in the long term. The combination with indomethacin is poorly tolerated and ineffective. Innovative approaches are required to use ACEi more effectively.",0,0

However, because of possible adverse effects of thyroid hormone, there is interest in developing analogs with fewer undesirable side effects. Screening of compounds structurally related to levothyroxine identified 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) as an analogue with inotropic selectivity and low metabolic activity in hypothyroid rats. When DITPA was administered alone or in combination with captopril in rat and rabbit post-infarction models of heart failure, cardiac output was increased and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LV EDP) decreased without increasing heart rate. A pilot clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DITPA. In a dose-finding study on 7 healthy volunteers, the drug was well tolerated. A double-blind comparison of DITPA with placebo was then performed in a group of 19 patients with moderate heart failure. Patients were randomized to receive either 1.875 mg/kg of DITPA or placebo daily. After 2 weeks, the drug was increased to 3.75 mg/kg daily for a further 2 weeks. In patients with heart failure who received the drug for 4 weeks, the cardiac index was increased (p=0.04) and the systemic vascular resistance index was decreased (p=0.02). Total serum cholesterol (p=0.013) and triglycerides (p=0.005) were also significantly reduced.

1036,12165170,Antihypertensive combination therapy for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.,,"Boner, Geoffrey; Cao, Zemin; Cooper, Mark E","Diabetic nephropathy is a major cause of end-stage renal disease and is often associated with other macrovascular complications such as ischemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease. Both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (AIIR) have been shown to have a protective effect on the progression of diabetic nephropathy and are therefore first-line treatments for hypertension and/or renal involvement become patients with diabetes. However, most of these patients, particularly those with type 2 diabetes, require two or more drugs to lower their blood pressure to levels suggested in recently published consensus papers. These blood pressure targets are 130/80 mm Hg in diabetics with proteinuria up to 1 g/day and 125/75 mm Hg in patients with proteinuria greater than 1 g/day. Combinations of different drugs can have a synergistic effect. Some of the early studies using a combination of either a non-dihydropyridine or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with ACE-I showed a synergistic effect on proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Although these studies have not been substantiated, calcium channel blockers play an important role in the treatment of patients with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension with their proven antihypertensive effect. Combining ACE-I with AIIR may have several theoretical advantages. Many studies of this combination have been conducted in animal models of diabetes and in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease. Some of these studies have shown a synergistic effect of the combination on proteinuria or high blood pressure, but the results have not been consistent across studies. It can be concluded that this combination could be used in patients whose proteinuria or hypertension did not respond to either active ingredient alone or to a combination of other drugs, until additional studies provide more convincing evidence.",0,0

Short term observation.,,"Tylicki, Leszek; Rutkowski, Przemyslaw; Renke, Marcin; Rutkowski, Boleslaw","The renin-angiotensin system is thought to be involved in the progression of chronic kidney disease of both diabetic and non-diabetic origin. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been confirmed to reduce urinary protein excretion (UPE) and attenuate the development of kidney damage. The angiotensin II receptor blockers are an alternative class of drugs that inhibit the activity of the renin-angiotensin system with preliminary confirmed renoprotective activity. However, there is a lack of data on the renoprotective effect of very low doses of these drugs.; Prospective, randomized, 3-month study of the effects of losartan 25 mg (n=17) vs enalapril 10 mg (n=17) vs combination of losartan 25 mg and enalapril 10 mg (n=15) on proteinuria, kidney Functional and metabolic profiles were performed in 51 patients with biopsy-proven chronic glomerulonephritis with normal or mildly impaired renal function [creatinine clearance (CRCL) between 36 and 93 ml/min]. Clinical evaluation and laboratory tests were estimated before treatment (basal), during the first week and after 3 months of therapy.; Both losartan and enalapril monotherapy significantly reduced proteinuria by 25.35 and 45.07%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the groups. The combination therapy induced a more remarkable reduction in proteinuria (65.96%) than either drug administered alone. This antiproteinuric effect was only significantly more pronounced in comparison to the losartan group (p = 0.009). The reduction in blood pressure was most pronounced in the combined group. In all groups, no connection was found between the drop in UPE and a reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure. A significant reduction in CRCL was observed with enalapril treatment immediately after 1 week of therapy (p=0.039) and at the end of observation (p=0.043). CRCL remained stable in losartan-treated patients. In the groups studied, no changes in serum creatinine levels, metabolic profile and sodium excretion were observed during therapy.; These results showed that even very small doses of losartan and enalapril reduce proteinuria in patients with primary glomerulonephritis. The combination of these drugs could have a significantly more potent antiproteinuric effect than either agent in monotherapy. It is likely that treatment with losartan is associated with a lower risk of an acute fall in glomerular filtration at the start of therapy compared to enalapril.",0,0

The aim of this investigation was to examine the mechanisms involved in dose-dependent functional effects and to test the hypothesis that a study-recommended high dose of lisinopril would improve aerobic exercise capacity and cardiovascular function more than a low dose. ; Twelve patients with symptomatic heart failure completed a randomized, double-blind, crossover study of lisinopril 5 mg once daily and 20 mg once daily for 24 weeks, with doses crossed at 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was aerobic exercise capacity, and the secondary endpoints were cardiac output at maximal exercise and dobutamine stimulation.; Aerobic exercise capacity (primary endpoint) was significantly higher during the 5 mg per day dose compared to the 20 mg dose (1696 vs. 1578 ml.min(-1), P=0.016), an increase of 1.53 ml.kg corresponds to (-1)min(-1) of 19.6 ml.kg(-1)min(-1) with 20mg when normalized to body weight. 73% of the patients showed higher peak oxygen consumption and peak cardiac output with the 5 mg daily dose than with 20 mg, and none showed the opposite. With respect to cardiac output, although the results were not statistically significant, there was a consistent pattern showing the same directional changes in favor of the lower dose in peak cardiac output during exercise and cardiac output at peak dobutamine. There were no significant differences in the resting values. A total of 24 adverse reactions were reported during the 5 mg phase compared to 38 during the 20 mg phase. Contrary to expectation, it was found that the aerobic exercise capacity of the patients was greater with the lower dose of lisinopril, suggesting that ACE inhibitor therapy in heart failure may require individual adjustment of doses to assess the functional benefit relative to the to optimize assumed prognostic advantages.",0,0

At baseline, 7998 patients did not have diabetes mellitus and were therefore at risk of developing the condition during the study. To demonstrate the ability to predict onset diabetes, we developed a predictive value using the significant variables from multivariate analyzes (serum glucose, body mass index, serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and history of previous use of antihypertensive drugs). ; There was a steadily increasing risk of diabetes with increasing level-of-risk score; Patients in the top quartile were at significantly higher risk than those in the bottom three. Losartan treatment was associated with a lower risk of developing diabetes within each of the four risk score quartiles. As previously reported, new-onset diabetes mellitus occurred in 242 patients receiving losartan (13.0 per 1000 person-years) and 320 patients receiving atenolol (17.5 per 1000 person-years); relative risk 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.88; p<0.001); New onset diabetes could be diagnosed by a newly developed risk score using baseline (non-fasting) serum glucose concentration, body mass index, serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration, systolic blood pressure and history of prior use of antihypertensive drugs can be clearly predicted. Regardless of these risk factors, less hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy developed diabetes mellitus when treated with losartan than when treated with atenolol.",0,0

We conducted this study to determine whether increasing the ACE inhibitor dose beyond the maximal antihypertensive effect has additional antiproteinuric potential.; 23 patients with proteinuria were given the ACE inhibitor spirapril at an initial dose of 3 to 6 mg/day. The dose was increased every 6 weeks until the maximum antihypertensive effect as measured by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) was reached (spir(max)), then increased to a supramaximal dose (spir(supramax)). Renal parameters, urinary protein excretion and systemic activity of the renin-angiotensin system were compared between baseline, Spir(max) and Spir(supramax). Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were determined before administration of spirapril and after administration of the supramaximal dose; Median ABP and proteinuria decreased significantly between baseline and Spir(max) (median 102 mm Hg; range 82 to 122 mm Hg versus 97 mm Hg; range 82 to 113 mm Hg; median protein 2.56 g/d; range 1.05 to 22.1 g/day versus 1.73 g/day; range 0.42 to 4.7 g/day). Both creatinine levels and creatinine clearance remained unchanged. The suppression of angiotensin II production led to a significant increase in renin and angiotensin I concentrations and a non-significant decrease in aldosterone levels. Increasing spirapril to a supramaximal dose had no additional effect on serum renin or angiotensin I levels or proteinuria. There was an additional slight decrease in aldosterone levels and subsequently a significantly lower level than at baseline.; Our results show that the antiproteinuric effect of spirapril is associated with its antihypertensive effect. Although high-dose ACE inhibitor therapy has no additional effect on proteinuria, a possible positive long-term effect cannot be ruled out.",0,0

Using an evidence-based clinical guideline, we evaluated the care of patients with systolic heart failure.; We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 420 patients from 25 general practices in upstate New York who had been diagnosed with heart failure. Medical records confirmed the diagnosis (n=395). We excluded patients with noncardiogenic volume overload or correctable valvular disease (n = 338). Performance profiles measured diagnostic test use, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurement, patient education, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prescribing. For treatment recommendations, patients were classified by LVEF status.; Only 82% of the patients studied had an LVEF test result documented in their medical records. Of these, 49% had LVEF < or = 40%. Use of ACE inhibitors was more common in patients with low LVEF (91%) than in patients with normal LVEF (62%). Of the patients with systolic heart failure taking ACE inhibitors, 87% reached their target dose. Adherence measures were low for laboratory assessment and patient education criteria.; Heart failure with normal LVEF was as common as systolic heart failure in these primary care practices. Prescribing performance profiles for ACE inhibitors exceeded those published in the literature. However, patients without documented measurement of LVEF received a lower quality of care as measured against this disease-specific guideline. This underlines the importance of the LVEF measurement.",0,0
1061,12224817,Angiotensin converting enzyme activity is implicated in the mechanism of elevation of endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,,"Ito, Akira; Egashira, Kensuke; Narishige, Takahiro; Muramatsu, Kouhei; Takeshita, Akira","The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in increasing asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, in hypertensive patients, therefore the present study was designed to investigate whether the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is also involved in the mechanism of ADMA elevation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). A crossover study was performed to determine whether ACE inhibition with perindopril (4 mg/day) for 4 weeks reduced serum ADMA concentration and plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels (a marker for endothelial damage) in 11 patients with NIDDM. None of the patients were treated with insulin or oral antidiabetics, and none had major diabetic complications. Before starting the protocol, serum ADMA and plasma vWF were significantly higher in the 11 NIDDM patients compared to 8 non-diabetic controls. Perindopril had no effect on blood pressure or glucose metabolism but significantly reduced serum ADMA and plasma vWF. These results suggest that endothelial damage associated with ADMA elevation may be present even in patients with uncomplicated NIDDM and that increased activity of ACE may be implicated in such endothelial dysfunction.",0,0

However, there is a possibility that an artery connected to an open infarct may promote healing after AMI; Of 223 patients with anterior Q-Wave AMI, 66 with isolated persistent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) were randomized to the following treatments: 1) medical therapy (occluded arteries group; n=34) or 2) late intervention and Stent for LAD + drug therapy (open artery group; n = 32). The study was designed to compare left ventricular (LV) end-systolic volume between the two groups 12 months after AMI; Late intervention 26 +/- 18 days after AMI resulted in significantly higher LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes at 12 months than drug therapy alone (106.6 +/- 37.5 mL vs. 79.7 +/- 34 .4 mL, p<0.01 and 162.0 +/- 51.4 mL vs. 130.1 +/- 46.1 mL, p<0.01 respectively). Exercise duration and maximum workload increased significantly in both groups from 6 weeks to 12 months after AMI, although absolute values were greater in the open artery group. Quality of life scores tended to worsen during this time interval in patients with closed arteries but remained unchanged in patients with patent arteries. Coronary angiography at 1 year documented a low incidence of intergroup crossover (spontaneous recanalization in 19% and occlusion in 11%). In the present study, recanalization of occluded infarct-related arteries in symptom-free patients approximately 1 month after AMI had an adverse effect on remodeling, but tended to increase exercise tolerance and improve quality of life.",0,0

Grouped and a mean 22.4 months. Serial echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular diastolic inner diameter (LVIDd) and ejection fraction (EF) were recorded. Overall study reproducibility calculated to 90% power at 5% significance, defined detectable differences of 0.09 cm for LVIDd and 0.86% for EF.; Baseline LVIDd and EF for valsartan and placebo groups were similar: 3.6 +/- 0.5 versus 3.7 +/- 0.5 (cm/m(2)) and 26.6 +/- 7, 3 versus 26.9 +/- 7.0(%). Mean group changes from baseline over time were compared.

Correcting these factors results in a reduction in the progression of plaque formation and associated arterial wall thickness. However, atheroma remains a focal disease that develops at characteristic sites within the arterial tree. These sites are typically located in areas of vascular bifurcation or pronounced curvature and correspond to regions of high tensile stress and low shear stress, leading to the hypothesis that local hemodynamic factors and vessel wall mechanics potentiate focal development of atheroma. Current assessment of vascular hemodynamics suffers from an inability to deal with complex flows and does not allow accurate determination of locally varying flow and shear stress patterns. However, the application of computational flow simulation (CFD) techniques to ultrasound and local pressure data allows for a comprehensive, non-invasive assessment of hemodynamic flow parameters. The Candesartan cilexetil and Atenolol Carotid Haemodynamic Endpoint Trial (CACHET) study compares the effects of two antihypertensive regimens, one B-blocker-based and the other angiotensin-receptor-blocker-based, on carotid artery intima-media thickness. The collection of ultrasound and pressure data on each subject provides a unique opportunity to apply this data to the CFD model to study the impact of these antihypertensive therapies on local fluid dynamics. This will lead to a better understanding of the relationship of these factors to atheroma formation and regression.",0,0

In 24 patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association class II to III, in stable condition and on cardiovascular medication [aged 70 to 83 years]), blood pressure (BP) was measured with Finapres and cortical concentrations of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin were measured measured by near-infrared spectroscopy while standing and after a 292-kcal carbohydrate meal. Tests were performed before and during therapy with furosemide 40 mg once daily (n=11) or captopril 6.25 and 12.5 mg twice daily (n=13) in a double-blind, randomized study. Before treatment, 13 of 24 patients had PPH and 2 of 24 patients had OH. The first dose of furosemide significantly reduced postmeal systolic blood pressure (p<0.05) and postmeal frontal cortical oxygenation (p<0.05), while the first dose of captopril did not. Furosemide and captopril had no significant effect on postprandial or orthostatic blood pressure or cortical oxygenation after 2 weeks of treatment. Therefore, PPH is a common phenomenon in elderly patients with heart failure, while OH is not. The first dose of furosemide 40 mg reduced postprandial systolic blood pressure and frontal cortical oxygenation, in contrast to the first dose of captopril 6.25 mg and 2-week treatment with furosemide 40 mg once daily or captopril 12.5 mg twice daily. These results indicate that initiating treatment with furosemide worsens PPH and that furosemide is less safe in elderly patients with heart failure.",0,0

Optimal study in myocardial infarction with angiotensin II antagonist losartan.,,"Dickstein, Kenneth; Kjekshus, John","ACE inhibitors attenuate the deleterious effects of angiotensin II and improve survival and reduce morbidity in patients with acute myocardial infarction and evidence of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction. Selective antagonism of the angiotensin type 1 receptor represents an alternative approach to inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system. We conducted a multicenter, randomized study to test the hypothesis that the angiotensin II antagonist losartan ACE -Inhibitor captopril would be superior or non-inferior in reducing all-cause mortality in high-risk patients after acute myocardial infarction.; 5477 patients aged 50 years or older (mean age 67.4 years [SD 9.8]) with confirmed acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure during the acute phase or a new anterior Q-wave infarction or reinfarction were referred from 329 centers in seven European countries recruited countries. Patients were randomized and titrated to a target dose of losartan (50 mg once daily) or captopril (50 mg three times daily) based on tolerability. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The analysis was intended to treat.; There were 946 deaths during a mean follow-up of 2.7 (0.9) years: 499 (18%) in the losartan group and 447 (16%) in the captopril group (relative risk 1.13 [95% CI 0.99-1.28], p=0.07). The results for the secondary and tertiary endpoints were as follows: sudden cardiac death or resuscitated cardiac arrest 239 (9%) versus 203 (7%), 1.19 (0.98-1.43), p=0.07 and more fatal or non-fatal reinfarction 384 (14%) vs. 379 (14%), 1.03 (0.89-1.18), p=0.72. Admission rates for all causes were 1806 (66%) versus 1774 (65%), 1.03 (0.97-1.10), p=0.37. Losartan was significantly better tolerated than captopril, with fewer patients discontinuing study medication (458 [17%] vs. 624 [23%], 0.70 [0.62-0.79], p<0.0001); Since we saw a non-significant difference in all-cause mortality in favor of captopril, ACE inhibitors should remain the first-line therapy in patients after a complicated acute myocardial infarction. Losartan cannot be generally recommended in this population. However, it was better tolerated than captopril and was associated with significantly fewer treatment discontinuations. Although the role of losartan in patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibition is not well defined, it can be considered in such patients.",0,0

Hypertensive patients, who were evaluated before starting drug treatment, and those with normal blood pressure formed the control groups. All groups were examined using psychological methods (BDI, HSC, Raven's Matric Test). There were also no significant differences between the groups in the total score and in individual factors for the BDI. For HSC, there were significant differences in overall scores between untreated hypertensive and normotensive patients (p<0.05). The depression/anxiety profile was the main factor that was itself significantly different in these groups (p<0.05). Enalapril and captopril reversed the negative behavioral changes caused by hypertension only moderately and without statistical significance. There were no changes in intellectual ability measured by Raven's Matric test in any of the groups studied. In conclusion, significant negative emotional effects of hypertension are only partially reversed by the antihypertensive doses of enalapril and captopril.",0,0

Biopsies from 10 normal kidney donors were used as controls. The number of mesangial and endothelial cells was increased in the 50 diabetics at the start of the study compared to the controls. There was no difference in podocyte count. Glomerular volume was increased in diabetics, but the surface area of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), underlying the podocytes, did not differ between groups. AER correlated positively with mesangial cell count in microalbuminurics (r = 0.44, P = 0.012) and negatively with podocyte count in proteinurics (r = -0.48, P = 0.040). In the 16 placebo-treated patients, glomerular volume increased at 3 years due to matrix accumulation and increased GBM surface area. Although the total cell count was not significantly different from baseline, the decrease in podocyte count during follow-up correlated with the AER at follow-up (r = -0.72, P = 0.002). In conclusion, cross-sectional analysis of podocyte count in type 1 diabetics with elevated AER but normal blood pressure shows no significant reduction compared to non-diabetic controls. Longitudinal data provide evidence of an association between podocyte loss and AER, but whether cellular changes are a response to, a cause, or concomitant of nephropathy progression remains uncertain.",0,0

However, information on the effect of antihypertensive treatment (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors - ACEI) on cardiac ANS activity is scarce. The purpose of the study was to evaluate circadian HRV changes in patients with essential hypertension treated with ACEI over a 1-year period.; Ten patients with essential hypertension aged 26 to 64 years (mean 54.3 +/- 12.3) and 10 healthy subjects matched for age and sex were eligible for the study. In both of these groups, 24-hour arterial blood pressure measurements were performed with simultaneous ECG monitoring. The hypertensive patients were examined before and after taking ACE inhibitors (enalapril) for 1 year. HRV analysis was performed by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Temporal and spectral parameters were compared in diurnal (6-10 p.m.) and night-time (10 p.m.-6 a.m.) periods in 8 subjects characteristic of dippers; Results obtained before treatment, also in the control group, showed nocturnal increases in RMSSD (p<0.05), pNN50 (NS, p>0.05), VLF, LF (p<0.05) and HF (NS ) means with a decrease in LF/HF ratio (p < 0.05). Similar trends in cardiac ANS activity were observed after 1 year of enalapril administration. A comparison of daily HRV before and after one year of ACE inhibition showed the increase in values of the parasympathetic system reflecting parameters: RMSSD, pNN50 (p = 0.01) and HF (NS) with a decrease in LF/HF ratio (p < 0.01). Evaluation of nocturnal HRV parameters showed the increase in mean HR (p<0.05), with no other significant changes between trials.; After 1 year of ACE inhibitor administration, the only improvement observed was in daytime parasympathetic activity.

Large-scale, randomized, controlled trials have contributed immensely to our understanding of the management of life-threatening arrhythmias. There are many causes of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, most of which occur after a heart attack has healed. Treatments available for managing ventricular arrhythmias include antiarrhythmics, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and catheter ablation. Each therapy offers unique benefits for select patients with life-threatening arrhythmias. Because the goal of arrhythmia management is not just to provide the best single therapy, but to provide the greatest possible safety in controlling the symptomatic arrhythmia, the use of combination therapy has become a standard treatment strategy for patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias. This review discusses the different treatment modalities available to treat life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and their potential risks and benefits. The reasons for using a hybrid or combination therapy are presented. Finally, some of the more well-known primary and secondary prevention studies on the treatment of ventricular tachycardia are discussed.",0,0

It has been observed that the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is at least partially mediated by NO. We performed an in-patient crossover study with the aim of investigating the potential effect of NAC on the antihypertensive effect of ACEI via an NO-dependent mechanism. We studied 18 smokers (> 10 years habit and > 10 cigarettes daily) hypertensive patients (15 males and three females aged 69 +/- 5 years) on ACEI therapy (11 captopril and seven enalapril). Patients were randomized to two treatment arms. In one arm, patients (n=10) initially received NAC (600 mg three times daily) in addition to the ACEI regimen. In the other group (n=8), patients remained on ACEI only. After 21 days, the therapy patterns were crossed. The first group received ACEI only and the second group received ACEI and NAC and completed another 21 day treatment period. We evaluate the effect of NAC on each patient through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) performed at the end of each therapeutic regimen. A significant reduction in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure (24 hBP) and daily BP (dtBP) was achieved with the combination of ACEI and NAC (ACEI + NAC) compared to the ACEI alone period: 24 hBP = 146 .1 +/- 4.2 versus 137 +/- 3.1 (p < 0.05) and 89.2 +/- 2.8 versus 83.5 +/- 3.7 mmHg (p = 0.01 ). DtBP: 149.7 +/- 5.6 versus 141 +/- 3.7 and 92.1 +/- 4 versus 86 +/- 3.2 (both, p < 0.05). No significant difference was observed in nocturnal blood pressure (ntBP). The NAC effect was not statistically different for the two ACEIs. In conclusion, the addition of NAC to an ACEI potentiates its antihypertensive effects during 24hBP and dtBP in hypertensive smokers. This effect may be mediated through an NO-dependent mechanism, likely through the protective effect of NAC on NO oxidation.",0,0

The effect of exposure to cold and the effect of acute angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy on peak exercise capacity in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure have not been studied.; Eleven patients with New York Heart Association Classes II and III congestive heart failure aged 61.6 years (mean SD) with an LV ejection fraction of 25.6% completed four symptom-limited maximal exercise tests at 20°C and -8°C in case of cold chamber. The exercise tests were performed while the patients were treated with lisinopril or a placebo for three days. Cold exposure significantly decreased exercise duration in patients treated with placebo (506,156 s [20 C] vs. 419,182 s [-8 C], P<0.01). Frequency-pressure products measured after 4 min during the test and at peak power were significantly increased at -8 °C. Patients treated with lisinopril showed a significant mitigation of the decrease in cold exercise time (-17% for placebo versus -6.6% for lisinopril, P<0.05); Cold temperatures increase cardiac demand in response to exercise and significantly reduce maximal exercise capacity in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Acute treatment with lisinopril attenuates the effects of cold on exercise capacity.",0,0

Patients (> or = 60 years) were placed on nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5 to 20 mg/day) or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg/day) or on matched placebos randomized. At baseline, pulse pressure and mean pressure were determined from six conventional blood pressure (BP) measurements and from 24-hour ambulatory recordings. Adjusting for significant covariates, we calculated mutually adjusted relative risk rates associated with 10 mm Hg increases in pulse pressure or mean pressure. In the placebo group, 24-hour and nocturnal pulse pressures consistently predicted all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, all cardiovascular events, stroke, and cardiac events. Daily pulse pressure predicted cardiovascular mortality, all cardiovascular endpoints, and stroke. The hazard rates for 10 mm Hg increase in pulse pressure ranged from 1.25 to 1.68. Conventionally measured pulse pressure predicted only cardiovascular mortality with a hazard ratio of 1.35. In the active treatment group, compared to the placebo patients, the association between outcome and ambulatory pulse pressure was weakened to a non-significant level. Mean pressure determined from ambulatory or conventional blood pressure measurements was not associated with a poorer prognosis. In conclusion, in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, higher pulse pressure estimated by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring was a better predictor of adverse outcomes than conventional pulse pressure, while conventional and ambulatory mean pressures were not associated with a poorer outcome correlated.",0,0

Our main objective was to test the antihypertensive effects of lisinopril as an adjunct to standard therapy on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in post-transplant patients. The secondary objective was to monitor echocardiographic and hemodynamic endpoints.; Post-transplant patients with an abnormality in 24-hour ABP recording were recruited for this double-blind, randomized, prospective study that began 2 to 3 months post-transplant. The patients were then examined at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after transplantation.; Lisinopril reduced clinical BP and ABP, the latter from 134/85 to 126/82 mm Hg at 6 months (p=0.01 v placebo) and 121/79 mm Hg at 2 years (p=0.03 v placebo). Fewer patients in the lisinopril group required additional amlodipine to control blood pressure (p=0.01). Left ventricular (LV) mass data are difficult to interpret because the lisinopril group in this small study happened to have lower baseline values than placebo. However, mean LV mass decreased by 10% (P=0.02) and mass index by 13% (P=0.01) in the lisinopril group, while LV mass and LV index decreased with placebo not changed. LV end-diastolic diameter increased only in the placebo group (p=0.008). There were no significant changes in any of the other secondary endpoints, including cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance.; Thus, in these post-transplant patients, tighter blood pressure control to normal levels by adding lisinopril to existing therapy resulted in a reduction in blood pressure and a small decrease in LV mass without altering the hemodynamic function of the heart.",0,0

Their systolic blood pressure on admission was 160 to 219 mm Hg, with diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mm Hg. Antihypertensive therapy was started immediately after randomization in the active treatment group, but only after completion of the double-blind study in the control patients. Treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day), with the possible addition of enalapril maleate (5-20 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), or both add-on drugs.; The median follow-up increased from 2.0 years in the double-blind study to 3.9 years overall. The incidence of dementia doubled from 32 to 64 cases, 41 of whom suffered from Alzheimer's. Throughout follow-up, systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 7.0/3.2 mm Hg higher in the 1417 control patients than in the 1485 patients randomized to active treatment. At the last examination, the difference in blood pressure was still 4.2/2.9 mmHg; 48.1%, 26.4%, and 11.4% of control patients were taking nitrendipine, enalapril, and/or hydrochlorothiazide, while in the active treatment group these proportions were 70.2%, 35.4%, and 18.4%, respectively. Compared to controls, long-term antihypertensive therapy reduced the risk of dementia by 55%, from 7.4 to 3.3 cases per 1000 patient-years (43 vs. 21 cases, P<0.001). After adjusting for sex, age, education, and baseline blood pressure, the relative risk rate associated with nitrendipine use was 0.38 (95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.64; p<0.001). Treating 1000 patients for 5 years can prevent 20 cases of dementia (95% confidence interval, 7-33).; Extensive follow-up of Syst-Eur patients supports evidence that antihypertensive therapy initiated with a long-acting dihydropyridine protects against dementia in elderly patients with systolic hypertension.",0,0

Patients underwent captopril-enhanced scintigraphy or routine unenhanced US (the usual diagnostic methods at the centers where the study was conducted) and contrast-enhanced US (with Levovist, Berlex Canada, Lachine, Que.). Patients were followed up for 3 months after diagnostic tests were performed.; Enhanced US revealed a diagnosis for a significantly larger proportion of patients than US without enhancement (77 [99%] vs. 64 [82%] of 78 patients; p = 0.002) or captopril-enhanced scintigraphy (71 [99%] vs. 58 [81%] of 72 patients; p=0.002).

In contrast, the diagnosis was only possible in 58 (81%) of the 72 patients who underwent both enhanced US and captopril-enhanced scintigraphy; the same diagnosis was reported in 53 (91%) of these 58 cases. Angiography was performed in 11 patients (21 kidneys) during follow-up. Significant stenosis was noted in 6 (55%) patients (8 [38%] of the kidneys).

Angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists may be able to reverse left ventricular fibrosis in ESRD patients. The ultrasonographically integrated backscatter (IBS) of the myocardial walls is directly related to the morphometrically determined collagen content in humans. In this study, 30 hypertensive patients on chronic hemodialysis were randomized to antihypertensive therapy with either the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) antagonist losartan (n = 10) or the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor enalapril (n = 10) or calcium antagonist amlodipine (n = 10). IBS of the posterior wall of the left ventricle was measured by IBS before and after 6 months of treatment. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics did not differ in three subgroups. Although treatment with losartan (34.2 +/- 1.8 to 30.2 +/- 2.4 dB: p=0.0094) showed a significant reduction in IBS scores, enalapril (30.3 +/- - 1.5 to 31.7 +/- 1.4 dB: p = 0.3268) and amlodipine ( 31.6 +/- 1.6 to 33.1 +/- 1.9 dB: p = 0, 4632) did not change significantly before and after 6 months of treatment.

Three groups showed a similarly significant decrease in mean blood pressure. Compared to pre-treatment control levels, plasma angiotensin II concentrations were significantly increased by a factor of 5.0 with losartan treatment, in contrast unchanged with enalapril and increased only 2.0-fold with treatment with amlodipine. This study indicates that losartan reduces left ventricular fibrosis and this effect may be via an anti-AT1-R effect.",0,0
1082,12401122,Influence of drugs and gender on arterial pulse wave and natriuretic peptide secretion in untreated patients with essential hypertension.,,"Deary, Alison J; Schumann, Anne L; Murfet, Helen; Haydock, Stephen; Foo, Roger S; Brown, Morris J","Recent studies have suggested differential impacts of mean and pulse pressure on myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as differences between major drugs in their effectiveness in preventing these individual endpoints. We hypothesized that antihypertensive drugs have different effects on the pulse wave even if their effects on blood pressure are the same. We studied 30 untreated hypertensive patients, aged 28 to 55 years, who were rotated through six 6-week courses of daily treatment with amlodipine 5 mg, doxazosin 4 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, bisoprolol 5 mg, bendrofluazide 2.5 mg, or placebo. The best drug was repeated at the end of the rotation. Blood pressure measurements and radial pulse tonometry (by Sphygmocor) were performed at each visit, and blood was drawn for measurement of atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The Sphygmocor derivation of the central aortic pulse wave was used to measure the time for transmission of the reflected wave (T(R)) and the augmentation index (AI), which is the proportional increase in systolic pressure due to the reflected wave. There was a disconnect between the effects of drugs on blood pressure and pulse wave analysis. Bisoprolol caused the greatest decrease in blood pressure and T(R) but was the only drug that increased AI. This paradoxical response to bisoprolol was associated with a 3-fold increase in plasma BNP levels. As previously described, there was a smaller increase in BNP in women compared to men, and this increase was also associated with significantly higher AI scores. Other drugs reduced AI, and this was associated with a significant decrease in BNP from amlodipine. In summary, antihypertensive drugs differ in their short-term effects on increasing the systolic pulse wave and secretion of BNP from the heart, which is considered a sensitive measure of cardiomyocyte stress. These differences may help explain cause-specific differences in the results of recent studies.",0,0

Two-dimensional guided M-mode echocardiograms were performed at screening (recruitment scan), randomization (baseline scan), and after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment. Baseline and treatment echocardiograms were read at two central laboratories without knowledge of the scan timing. In intention-to-treat (ITT) analyzes (196 patients), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) were significantly and equally reduced by the two treatments. Candesartan and enalapril reduced LVMI to the same extent, ie by 15.0 and 13.1 g/m2 (-10.9 and -8.4%; P<0.001 for both). The proportion of patients achieving normalization of LVMI was not significantly higher with candesartan (36.3 versus 28.6%). Similar results were obtained in Per-Protocol (PP) analyses. The incidence of cough was lower with candesartan (p<0.03). CATCH is the first major study to compare the effects of an AIIA and an ACEI on LVMI.

Twenty-seven hypertensive patients were randomized to treatment with lisinopril (20 mg) or losartan (50 mg) for 5 weeks and then switched to the alternative treatment for a second period of 5 weeks. Measurements of CBP, 24-hour ABP, and 5-day HBP were taken prior to randomization and at the end of each treatment period. All methods of measurement showed that lisinopril was more effective than losartan at lowering blood pressure. However, the difference between the two drugs was demonstrated with greater accuracy using HBP (P<0.001) than 24-h ABP (P<0.01), while the worst accuracy for detecting this difference was by CBP (P<0, 05) has been provided. Lisinopril was also found to be more effective than losartan in reducing HPP (p=0.01) and 24-hour APP (p=0.03), while no such difference was seen when measuring CPP. It was concluded that the antihypertensive drugs may differ in their effect not only on BP, but also on PP. HBP monitoring appears to be as reliable as 24-hour ABP monitoring in detecting differences in drug effects on both BP and PP. Clinical measurements seem to be the least reliable method, especially in detecting differences in PP.",0,0

Blood pressure was normalized in both groups (with decreases of 25 +/- 5/17 +/- 2 and 29 +/- 3/15 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively). Lipid profile, GT, insulin release and insulin sensitivity of both glucose uptake and lipolysis were unchanged after both treatments. The authors conclude that in non-obese, normolipidemic, glucose-tolerant hypertensive patients, normalization of blood pressure with combination therapy is possible without cost in terms of adverse effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity.",0,0

The nonresponder patients or those who complained of side effects during the titration period were discontinued (n=144); The remaining 309 patients were included in the study and treated with the same therapy for 4 years. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), UAE, creatinine clearance and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were assessed every 6 months.; The combination therapy was more effective than either drug alone at lowering blood pressure at any time point in the study, without affecting glucose homeostasis. All three treatments resulted in a significant decrease in UAE over the 48-month study period. However, this effect was more pronounced and appeared earlier with fosinopril than with amlodipine monotherapy (after 3 vs. 18 months of therapy). In addition, the combination therapy provided a stronger antialbuminuric effect than the individual drugs. This could be due to the greater blood pressure lowering effect, although other drug-specific effects cannot be excluded. Cardiovascular outcomes were similar in the amlodipine and fosinopril groups, but were lower in the combination group.; These results strengthen the case for using a combination of calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes.",0,0

1093,12461307,Sexual dysfunction in patients with hypertension: implications for therapy.,,"Ferrario, Carlos M; Levy, Pavel","Sexual dysfunction associated with hypertension or antihypertensive therapies may affect patients' ability to continue therapy and result in a decrease in patients' quality of life. Therefore, it is important for practitioners to become familiar with the wide variation in sexual side effects of antihypertensive drugs and to discuss the possible occurrence of these side effects with their patients. In many cases, changing the medication regimen can help the patient overcome specific sexual side effects experienced with certain treatments. Physicians should consider selecting an antihypertensive regimen that is highly effective in reducing blood pressure but maintaining patients' quality of life. The effect of drugs on sexual function remains controversial. Some blinded studies report little difference between placebo and certain drugs, while other studies indicate that antihypertensive drugs increase sexual dysfunction, which affects quality of life. Recent evidence suggests that losartan, an angiotensin II antagonist, is not typically associated with the development of sexual dysfunction and in fact positively affects several indices of sexual function (erectile function, sexual satisfaction, and frequency of sexual activity) as well as perceived quality of life can affect . Therefore, angiotensin II antagonists may represent a therapeutic option to prevent or correct erectile dysfunction in hypertensive patients. The beneficial effects of these agents on sexual function may be related in part to their ability to block angiotensin II, which has recently been recognized as an important mediator of decongestion and possible erectile dysfunction.",0,0

The present study compares the time-course effects of ACE inhibition and angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonism on morning plasma PAI-1 antigen. Blood pressure and endocrine, metabolic, and fibrinolytic variables were evaluated in 20 insulin-resistant subjects (defined by fasting glucose > 8.3 mmol/L, body mass index > 28 kg/m2, or fasting serum triglyceride > or = 2.8 mmol/L) Hypertensive measured subjects (mean age 47.9 +/- 2.1 years) (1) before and after 1 week of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/day and (2) before and 1, 3, 4 and 6 weeks after addition of ramipril ( escalated to 10 mg/d) or losartan (escalated to 100 mg/d).

Secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality, stroke, composite CAD (primary endpoint, coronary revascularization or angina with hospitalization), and composite cardiovascular disease (combined CAD, stroke, treated angina without hospitalization, heart failure [HF], and peripheral arterial disease). .; The mean follow-up time was 4.9 years. The primary endpoint occurred in 2956 participants with no difference between treatments.

There were risk markers for sudden death that differed from risk markers for death from chronic heart failure. Low systolic blood pressure at baseline, elevated creatinine, reduced serum sodium or hemoglobin, and increased heart rate were associated with death from chronic heart failure. Use of beta-blockers or antiarrhythmics (mainly amiodarone) was associated with a reduced risk of sudden death, while long-acting nitrates and prior use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were markers of increased risk. Using competing risk analyzes of the data from the ATLAS study has identified variables associated with certain types of death in patients with heart failure.

However, pathophysiological studies suggest that excessive reduction in blood pressure (BP) could be potentially harmful in hypertensive patients with ischemic heart disease.; We analyzed data from the GISSI-3 study (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto miocardico) to compare the effects of early treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors during AMI in patients with a history of hypertension to evaluate normotensive patients. In the study, 19,394 patients were randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of lisinopril treatment or a control group, with treatment beginning within 24 hours of the onset of AMI.; In the 10,661 normotensive patients, lisinopril significantly reduced fatal events, but in the 7,362 hypertensive patients, a higher rate of fatal events was reported on the first day of treatment and the benefits only materialized thereafter. These results may be due to the subset of 1165 hypertensive patients with low baseline systolic blood pressure (lower quintile, blood pressure < 120 mm Hg) who were more likely to develop critical hypotension after treatment with lisinopril. Indeed, these patients showed a higher mortality rate as a result of excessive cardiogenic shock on the first day of treatment with lisinopril (odds ratio 3.07, 95% CI 1.39-6.77) and a sustained unfavorable death trend at 6 weeks.; These data suggest that caution should be exercised in the use of lisinopril in the acute phase of myocardial infarction in patients with a history of hypertension but low systolic blood pressure at presentation.",1,1
1098,12487393,Strategy for the management of patients with non-compliant hypertensive hemodialysis.,,"Ross, E A; Pittman, T B; Koo, L C","Hypertensive hemodialysis patients who do not adhere to their medication do not benefit from pharmacological advances in the treatment of hypertension and increase their already high risk of cardiovascular complications. Medical workers are often frustrated by severe hypertension in patients who refuse to take medication at home, drink excessive amounts of fluids, miss multiple dialysis sessions, and go off dialysis early. In addition to addressing the psychosocial, financial, educational, and substance abuse issues that contribute to noncompliance, we have developed a medication strategy designed to serve at least as a temporary means of lowering blood pressure. Antihypertensive drugs, which have long half-lives (lisinopril) and/or are inherently long-acting (transdermal clonidine and amlodipine) in renal insufficiency, were administered on dialysis days by ward staff to those patients who were not taking that dose or any dose, or did not want to take it alone. It was ensured that lisinopril and amlodipine were taken at least on dialysis days (three times a week) and the clonidine patch was replaced weekly. In this way, 16 patients were treated for whom they were unable to reliably administer medication themselves. They had a significant decrease in pre-dialysis systolic pressure of 15 mm Hg (175 +/- 6 to 160 +/- 5 mm Hg), diastolic pressure of 12 mm Hg (103 +/- 3 to 91 +/- 3 mm Hg ) , and mean pressure of 13 mm Hg (127 +/- 4 to 114 +/- 4 mm Hg). There was an improvement in blood pressure after dialysis, with mean blood pressure dropping by 13 mm Hg from 110 +/- 4 to 97 +/- 4 mm Hg. Many individuals had inconsistent blood pressure monitoring, had been on dialysis intermittently and therefore missed medications administered by the unit, and had ongoing fluid or drug abuse. The patients all accepted this regimen very well, even at their spontaneous request, and had no side effects worth mentioning. In summary, the entire medical team addresses non-compliance, but administering long-acting drugs in the dialysis unit helps many hypertensive dialysis patients who would otherwise be at increased risk of serious cardiovascular complications.",0,0

Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is reported to contribute to intrarenal hemodynamic abnormalities in diabetics. We investigated whether RAS blockade by captopril induces intrarenal hemodynamic changes in normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes.; The patients were between 40 and 65 years old (20 men and 20 women). A total of 15 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals served as controls. The resistance index (RI) of the interlobar arteries was examined by duplex Doppler sonography before and after oral captopril (25 mg) test.; No significant differences in RI values or plasma renin activity (PRA) were observed between patients and healthy subjects at baseline. In healthy subjects, the RI values after the captopril test were significantly higher than the baseline values (P < 0.01). However, in patients with type 2 diabetes, both normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric, post-test RI values were significantly lower than baseline values (P<0.001). There were significant negative correlations between DeltaRI and HbA1c (r=-0.458, P<0.005) and between DeltaRI and baseline PRA in diabetics (r=-0.339, P<0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that HbA1c and baseline PRA significantly and independently affected the extent of decrease in RI values after administration of captopril in diabetics (R2=0.391, P<0.0001); These results demonstrate that the intrarenal RAS can be activated in diabetics, that such activation can be affected by poor glycemic control, and that blockade of RAS activation by ACE inhibitors decreases intrarenal vascular resistance in diabetics.

Both classes of drugs have a primary mechanism of action that lowers the level of the respective risk factor. They also have mechanisms of action that can confer benefits beyond what is believed to be the drug's primary effect. This has led to speculation that statins reduce the risk of stroke beyond lowering cholesterol and ACE inhibitors reduce risk of stroke beyond lowering blood pressure.

The critical role of temporal delay and optimal sustained patency as modulators of successful reperfusion has been repeatedly demonstrated, and investigation of the ideal interface between pharmacological and mechanical reperfusion continues. Despite physician awareness and patient education programs, the time from onset of symptoms to treatment in STEMI remains approximately 3 hours for pharmacologic reperfusion, as documented in large clinical studies. Multiple enhancements with advanced paramedic training, 12-lead transmittable electrocardiograms, and bolus fibrinolytics facilitate potential prehospital diagnosis and treatment. As we move into the 21st century, it is therefore imperative to rethink strategies to address these and other issues related to the process of optimal care for most patients with STEMI. Of particular note are the opportunities offered by prehospital management, with initiation of therapy, triage to appropriate hospitals, or both, as important potential avenues to further improve patient outcomes. We review previous research in preclinical therapy for STEMI and practical barriers to implementation to provide a framework for interpreting future developments.",0,0

In summary, the trough effect on DBP was statistically greater for telmisartan than for perindopril. SBPM values were lower than office blood pressure values, with larger differences before than after treatment. About a quarter of the patients could be controlled with one method but not with the other.",0,0

When needed, hydroclorothiazide (12.5 mg) was added to treatment to improve the hypotensive response.; A reduction in SBP and DBP was observed in both treatment groups throughout the study. To achieve further blood pressure reduction, hydrochlorothiazide was administered to 6 patients with inadequate blood pressure response at week 4 (3 patients in the irbesartan group) and week 8 (2 patients in the irbesartan group and 1 patient in the irbesartan group). Fosinopril group) added. The SBP was reduced in the irbesartan group from 157.7 +/- 11.2 to 131.0 +/- 8.7 mmHg (12 weeks, p<0.001). DBP decreases from 94.1 +/- 5.6 to 82.7 +/- 4.2 mmHg (p<0.001). In the fosinopril group, SBP increased from 147.9 +/- 11.7 to 132.2 +/- 12.4 mmHg (p<0.001) and DBP from 92.3 +/- 6.3 to 84, 0 +/- 5.4 mmHg (p < 0.001). Final between-group differences in BP are not significant. The final blood pressure reduction in the irbesartan group (26.7 +/- 11.6 mmHg) was greater than that in the fosinopril group (15.6 +/- 11.6 mmHg, p=0.011). Blood pressure reduction was significant in the fosinopril group from month 1 (SBP 140.7 +/- 12.2, p=0.021; DBP 87.2 +/- 6.2, p=0.003). In the irbesartan group, blood pressure reduction was not significant up to month two (SBP 135.5 +/- 10.4, p<0.001; DBP 85.3 +/- 4.3, p<0.001). Fosinopril and irbesartan appear to be equally effective in reducing DBP. Irbesartan may have greater efficacy on systolic blood pressure. Irbesartan acts more slowly than fosinopril and this may be useful in preventing an acute fall in blood pressure.",0,0

During this time, the number of active substances has increased significantly, as has the number of indications for which these drugs are tested in randomized controlled clinical trials. Based on effective and very well tolerated antihypertensives, angiotensin receptor blockers have shown benefits in patients with diabetes and heart failure that are not only due to the reduced blood pressure, as recently completed studies show. The expanding therapeutic areas of these agents are increasing interest in their applicability across the cardiovascular continuum. A series of large-scale studies to be published over the next few years will further investigate the effects of angiotensin receptor blockers on a range of cardiovascular indications beyond hypertension.",0,0

Patients were titrated to the higher dose of study drug at week 6 if mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was > or = 90 mmHg. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in ambulatory DBP over the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval after 12 weeks of treatment. Telmisartan and enalapril produced similar reductions in DBP and systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline across all ABPM periods studied (last 6 h, 24 h, daytime and nighttime). Telmisartan resulted in significantly greater reductions in mean seated DBP as measured by an open-label automated in-clinic ABPM device, a difference of -2.02 mmHg (P<0.01). A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved a sitting diastolic response with telmisartan than with enalapril (59% versus 50%; P<0.05), also measured with the same ABPM device. Both treatments were well tolerated. Compared to telmisartan, enalapril was associated with a higher incidence of cough (8.9% versus 0.8%) and hypotension (3.9% versus 1.1%). Therefore, telmisartan may result in better long-term compliance and consequently better blood pressure control than enalapril.",0,0

1111,12530940,The L-arginine nitric oxide pathway in hypertension.,,"Kelm, Malte","Nitric oxide is involved in regulation of resting vascular tone, adjustment of blood flow to tissue metabolic needs, and adjustment of vessel diameter to inflow volume, ie, flow-mediated dilatation. Arterial hypertension is associated with increased vascular tone of resistance vessels, decreased compliance of conduit arteries, along with thickening of the intima media, leading to vascular remodeling. Dysfunctional endothelium triggers such maladaptive processes. Reduced nitric oxide bioavailability has been shown in subjects with hypertension depending on the duration and severity of arterial hypertension. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reverse endothelial dysfunction while reducing significant cardiac events due to improved bioavailability remains to be demonstrated. Long-term follow-up studies in individuals with manifest endothelial dysfunction and in offspring of hypertensive patients underline the prognostic and genetic importance of reduced nitric oxide bioavailability for the pathophysiology of arterial hypertension.",0,0

After screening and an 18-week run-in period, 263 patients were randomized to receive an angiotensin II receptor blocker (losartan, 100 mg daily), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (trandolapril, 3 mg daily), or a combination of both drugs at equivalent doses . A survival analysis was performed to compare the effects of each regimen on the composite primary endpoint of time to doubling of serum creatinine concentration or end-stage renal disease. The analysis was intended to treat.; Seven patients discontinued treatment or were otherwise lost to follow-up.

In ten stable hypertensive CKD patients (creatinine clearance, 46 +/- 17 mL/min per 1.73 m2(2)), sympathetic muscle nerve activity (MSNA), plasma renin activity (PRA), baroreceptor sensitivity and 24-hour ambulatory BP were measured in the absence of antihypertensive drugs (other than diuretics) at 6 weeks enalapril (10 mg orally) and at 6 weeks losartan (100 mg orally). The order of the three phases was randomized. Normovolemia was controlled with diuretics throughout the study and confirmed by measurements of extracellular fluid volume. Both enalapril and losartan reduced MSNA (from 33 +/- 10 to 27 +/- 13 and 27 +/- 13 bursts/min, respectively; P<0.05) and mean 24-h BP (from 141+ /- 8/93 +/- 8 to 124 +/- 9/79 +/- 8 and 127 +/- 8/81 +/- 9 mmHg; P < 0.01). PRA was no different during treatments. The change in blood pressure and the change in MSNA during treatments were correlated (r=0.70 and r=0.63, respectively; both P<0.05). The sensitivity of the baroreceptors was not affected by the treatments. This is the first study to compare the effects of ACE inhibition and AngII blockade on MSNA. In hypertensive CKD patients, enalapril and losartan reduced BP and MSNA equally. Differences in the modes of action of the two drugs did not result in differential effects on MSNA, supporting the view that AngII-mediated mechanisms make an important contribution to the pathogenesis of sympathetic hyperactivity in these patients.",0,0

There have been a number of significant randomized controlled trials that may impact management in each of these three categories.; For primary prevention, recent information from the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation, the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction to Hypertension, the Study on Cognition and Prognosis in the Elderly, and the Australian National Blood Pressure Study support the view that lowering blood pressure regardless of baseline blood protects against stroke pressure level. There is evidence that blocking the angiotensin system may offer additional protection. As for secondary prevention, the Perindopril Protection against Recurrent Stroke Study shows that lowering blood pressure with perindopril-based therapy reduces fatal or non-fatal stroke, again in subjects with hypertension or normotonia. There is uncertainty regarding blood pressure reduction in acute stroke, although the presentation of the most recent study evaluating acute candesartan cilexetil in stroke survivors, which found significant protection from vascular events with the use of candesartan, suggests that further studies should be conducted. ; Lowering blood pressure for the primary prevention of stroke should be done with a variety of therapeutics. According to current evidence, perindopril-based therapy should be used for secondary stroke prevention. There is still uncertainty as to whether lowering blood pressure in acute stroke is safe or improves outcomes.",0,0

In the Steno-2 study, we compared the effect of a targeted, intensified, multifactorial intervention versus conventional treatment on modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.; The primary endpoint of this open-label, parallel study was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, revascularization, and amputation. Eighty patients were randomly assigned to conventional treatment according to national guidelines and 80 to intensive treatment, with a gradual introduction of behavior modification and pharmacologic therapy targeting hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia and microalbuminuria, together with cardiovascular secondary prevention -diseases aspirin.; The mean age of the patients was 55.1 years and the mean follow-up time was 7.8 years. The reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels measured after an overnight fast, and the rate of urinary albumin excretion were all significantly greater in the intensive therapy group than in the conventional therapy group.

Survival and resource utilization data was collected for 6 months; Survival was extrapolated using data from the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study assuming a mean additional lifespan of 3 years. Costs were based on study drug use and hospitalization at the 6-month follow-up. A sensitivity analysis for drug dosage and survival time was performed.; Median survival over 6 months was 157 +/- 52 days in the levosimendan group and 139 +/- 64 days in the dobutamine group (P < 0.01). Extrapolated to 3 years, the gain in life expectancy was estimated at 0.35 years (discounted at 3%). Levosimendan increased the average cost per patient by 1108, which was solely due to the cost of the study drug. The incremental cost per life year saved (LYS) at European level was 3205; in the individual countries, the costs per LYS were between 3091 and 3331. The result was robust in the sensitivity analysis.; Although patients in the levosimendan group lived longer and were therefore exposed to longer hospital stays, there was no increase in hospital stays or hospital costs with levosimendan treatment. The cost per LYS with levosimendan compares well with other cost-benefit analyzes in cardiology.",0,0

This could be alleviated by medications such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which are effective in reducing proteinuria.; In this longitudinal study, we evaluated the extent to which up-titration of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril to the maximum tolerated dose (median [range]: 30 [10 to 40] mg/day) reduced proteinuria and dyslipidemia in 28 patients with non-diabetic chronic Nephropathies improved. Maximum lisinopril doses significantly and safely reduced proteinuria, total serum, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides without significantly affecting serum HDL and renal hemodynamics. The proteinuria already decreased at 10 mg/d. Serum lipids decreased progressively and dose-dependently during up-titration to maximal doses. Reductions in total and LDL-cholesterol correlated with increases in serum albumin/total protein and oncotic pressure, peaked at the maximum dose of lisinopril and persisted after treatment discontinuation. Despite a smaller reduction in proteinuria, hypercholesterolemia decreased more (reflecting the increase in serum albumin) in hypoalbuminemic patients than in normoalbuminemic patients, who had a smaller reduction in cholesterol and no changes in serum albumin despite a greater reduction in proteinuria. Changes in serum triglycerides were independent of changes in serum proteins, correlated strongly with lisinopril doses (r = -0.89, p = 0.003), and recovered immediately after treatment discontinuation. Lisinopril was well tolerated, did not affect renal hemodynamics, and caused symptomatic reversible hypotension in only two patients. In chronic nephropathies, up-titration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor to maximally tolerated doses safely improved hypertriglyceridemia through a direct, dose-dependent effect and hypercholesterolemia through amelioration of the nephrotic syndrome, particularly in patients with more severe hypoalbuminemia.",0,0

Surgical and now angiographic revascularization procedures are increasingly popular approaches to treating these patients. Results from randomized controlled trials suggest that revascularization may not improve survival but is useful in improving symptoms and exercise capacity. However, these studies are of limited value as they do not reflect the current state of revascularization techniques or optimal medical management. Because many of these studies were conducted more than a decade ago, patients were recruited before the survival benefits of antiplatelet, B-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and aggressive lipid lowering therapy were accepted.

Traditionally, the pathologic effects of RAAS were thought to be due to angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction and salt and water retention due to aldosterone. However, these hormones also have powerful trophic effects, stimulating increased mass in both the artery wall and left ventricle. In addition, angiotensin II and aldosterone predispose to vascular inflammation, thrombosis, oxidative stress and sudden cardiac death. Therapy directed at RAAS overactivity is essential for normalizing the prognosis of most patients with atherosclerosis. An angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor improves the prognosis of patients with atherosclerosis and/or diabetes even when blood pressure at baseline is normal. Angiotensin receptor blockers also improve cardiovascular structure and prognosis. Although these drugs are better tolerated than ACE inhibitors, they do not appear to be as effective in reducing event rates. Aldosterone receptor blockers also improve cardiovascular structure, function, and prognosis. Aldosterone receptor blockers appear to provide additional benefit when used with either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker.",0,0

We investigated the effects of an extended-release nitrate preparation and 2 angiotensin II (AII) inhibitors (an AII receptor antagonist and an ACE inhibitor) on aortic pulse wave contour and systemic blood pressure in hypertensive patients with high augmentation index caused by exaggerated pulse wave reflection. Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies were conducted in a total of 16 elderly patients with systolic hypertension who were resistant to conventional antihypertensive therapy. In one study, pharmacodynamic responses to single doses of placebo, isosorbide mononitrate, eprosartan, and captopril were determined; the other compared single-dose isosorbide mononitrate and placebo in patients treated with AII inhibitors at baseline. Blood pressure was measured by sphygmomanometry and pulse wave components by radial artery applanation tonometry. All 3 agents have been shown to decrease brachial systolic blood pressure, aortic systolic blood pressure and aortic pulse pressure. The qualitative effects on the contour of the aortic pulse wave were variable: the augmentation index was not significantly altered by either captopril or eprosartan, but was reduced by approximately 50% of placebo in both isosorbide mononitrate study groups (P<0.0001). We propose that isosorbide mononitrate corrected the enhanced wave reflection in systolic hypertension in these elderly patients by an effect distinct from that exerted by either acute or chronic AII inhibition.",0,0

Blood pressure increased only in the HTRs (+16 +/- 5/9 +/- 3 mm Hg) and remained elevated for 48 h (p < or = 0.05). After captopril, sodium excretion was comparable in the liver (87 +/- 13%) and cardiac (86 +/- 12%) groups and blood pressure did not change in either group. CONCLUSIONS; Cardiac transplant recipients have diminished diuretic and natriuretic responses to volume expansion mediated by their inability to suppress the RAAS. Pharmacological suppression of the RAAS normalized disturbances in blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. These results indicate that hypertension in HTRs is caused in part by a failure to reflexively suppress the RAAS when these patients become hypervolemic.",0,0

Patients randomized to placebo (moderate blood pressure control) had a mean blood pressure of 137 +/- 0.7/81 +/- 0.3 mm Hg over the past 4 years of treatment. In contrast, patients randomized to those assigned to intensive treatment with enalapril or nisoldipine had a mean 4-year blood pressure of 128 +/- 0.8/75 +/- 0.3 mm Hg (P < 0.0001 compared to the moderate control). Fifty-three patients were diagnosed with PAD, defined as an ankle-brachial index < 0.90 at the baseline visit. In patients with PAD, 3 cardiovascular events (13.6%) occurred with intensive treatment compared to 12 events (38.7%) with moderate treatment (p=0.046). After adjusting for multiple cardiovascular risk factors, an inverse relationship between ankle-brachial index and cardiovascular events was observed with moderate treatment (p=0.009) but not with intensive treatment (p=0.91). With intensive blood pressure monitoring, the risk of an event was not increased even with the lowest ankle-brachial index values and was just as high as in a patient without PAD; In diabetic PAOD patients, an intensive reduction in blood pressure to a mean of 128/75 mm Hg led to a significant reduction in cardiovascular events.",1,0

Therefore, the plasma enalaprilat level can be markedly increased with conventional dosing. It is unclear whether this excess drug exposure translates into improved blood pressure control. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the short-term blood pressure response to two different plasma levels of enalaprilat.; Short-term blood pressure responses were evaluated as part of an open-label, randomized, controlled study of the effect of high and low doses of enalapril on the progression of renal failure. Data were analyzed in all patients who completed 3 months of follow-up. Patients were assigned two enalaprilat trough plasma concentrations, either above 50 ng ml(-1) (high) (n=17) or below 10 ng ml(-1) (low) (n=18) and daily enalapril dose titrated accordingly .; The median (range) glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at baseline was 18 (7.9) in the high enalaprilat concentration group and 17 (7.3) mL min(-1) 1.73 m(2) in the Low concentration (NS) group. Nine patients in each group received baseline treatment with enalapril at a median daily dose of 5 mg in both the high (5-10) and low (2.5-20) groups. At the 3-month follow-up, the dose was 10 (2.5-30) and 1.9 (1.25-5) mg (P<0.0001). At 3 months, median enalaprilat trough concentrations were 82.5 (22-244) ng ml(-1) and 9.1 (2.5-74.8) ng ml(-1) (p<0.002). At baseline, the median systolic blood pressure was 140 (110-200) and 133 (110-165) in the high and low enalaprilat groups, respectively, and at 3 months was 135 (105-170) and 135 (105-165). 170). 130 (105-170) mmHg (NS). Median diastolic blood pressure was 80 mmHg in each group, both at baseline (65-100) and at follow-up (60-95) (NS). With simultaneous antihypertensive treatment (number of patients treated, mean daily dose), there was no difference between the groups during the observation period. Proteinuria remained stable in both groups throughout the study period; Patients in the high concentration group had higher plasma potassium concentrations on day 90 and patients in the low concentration group experienced a slight increase in GFR; In moderate to severe chronic renal failure, the same degree of blood pressure control has been achieved with both low and moderate daily doses of enalapril. This applied regardless of concomitant antihypertensive treatment.",0,0

It has been postulated that agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system confer benefits beyond lowering blood pressure. We compared outcomes in elderly patients with hypertension treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with outcomes in patients treated with diuretics.; We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label study with blinded endpoint assessments in 6083 hypertensive patients aged 65 to 84 years attending 1594 primary care practices. Subjects were followed for a median of 4.1 years, and the total number of cardiovascular events in the two treatment groups was compared using multivariate proportional hazards models.; At baseline, the treatment groups were well matched in terms of age, gender, and blood pressure. At the end of the study, blood pressure had decreased to a similar extent in both groups (decrease of 26/12 mm Hg). There were 695 cardiovascular events or all-cause death in the ACE inhibitor group (56.1 per 1000 patient-years) and 736 cardiovascular events or all-cause death in the diuretics group (59.8 per 1000 patient-years; the hazard ratio for a cardiovascular event or death with ACE inhibitor treatment was 0.89 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.00]; p=0.05).

In this study, we report the cost impact of using ramipril according to the HOPE study in both the US and Canada.; A third-party perspective was chosen (Medicare for the United States and Department of Health for Canada). We calculated the cost of ramipril and placebo treatment strategies. An annual discount rate of 3% was used over the 4.5 years of follow-up. Sensitivity analyzes were carried out. The costs are given in US dollars or in Canadian dollars. The total cost per patient (including acquisition cost of ramipril) did not differ between the groups in either country (United States, $13,520 vs. $13,631; Canada, $8,702 vs. $8,588). From the distribution of cases in the bootstrap analysis, we found that 90% of cases fall into either a cost-neutral or cost-saving situation (64% in the United States and 27% in Canada), or a cost-efficiency situation with an incremental cost-benefit -Ratio < $10,000 (in local currency) per primary event saved.; Based on these results, we suggest that ramipril use likely represents an efficient use of resources in both countries.

1143,12641480,The Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS): clinical implications for elderly patients with cerebrovascular disease.,,"Ratnasabapathy, Yogini; Lawes, Carlene M M; Anderson, Craig S","Blood pressure values are strongly predictive of the risks of a first and recurrent stroke. The benefit of antihypertensive therapy to prevent fatal and nonfatal stroke in middle-aged people is well established. However, until recently, there was uncertainty about the consistency of such benefits across different patient populations, and particularly among the elderly and those with a history of stroke. This paper reviews the evidence on the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy, particularly in elderly patients with a history of stroke, with particular attention to the results of the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS). PROGRESS was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that included 6,105 people with a history of cerebrovascular disease who were recruited from 172 outpatient departments in hospitals in ten countries. Participants (mean age 64 years; range 26-91 years) were randomized to active treatment with an ACE inhibitor-based antihypertensive regimen (perindopril) with or without the addition of the diuretic indapamide, or a matched placebo. At the end of follow-up (mean of 4 years), active treatment reduced the incidence of total stroke by 28% (95% CI 17-38%) and the rate of major vascular events by 26% (95% CI 16-34) . %). Importantly, treatment benefits were consistent across all major patient subgroups, including patients with and without hypertension, patients who were Asian and non-Asian, and for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke subtypes. There is now strong evidence that clinicians regard antihypertensive therapy as crucial for the prevention of stroke, particularly in patients with a known history of cerebrovascular disease (and vascular disease in general), regardless of the blood pressure readings the patients are following an acute stroke or a other vascular event clinically stable. Additional age-specific analyzes of the PROGRESS data, along with those from other completed studies, will provide more reliable information on the magnitude of benefit of antihypertensive therapy specifically for different age groups and particularly for the oldest (those age >80 years). In the meantime, however, an ACE inhibitor plus diuretic regimen that maximizes the degree of blood pressure reduction has a good safety profile and is an effective treatment to consider in all stroke patients, including the elderly.",0,0

We compared this data to a second larger dataset to determine whether these findings are an isolated or common phenomenon and to determine what factors influenced this difference.; The subjects were medicated hypertensive patients. Blood pressure measurements were obtained from ambulatory medical records.; The percentage of hypertensive patients with blood pressure controlled was significantly higher (p<0.001) when the cut-off < or = 140/90 mm Hg was used instead of < 140/90 mm Hg. When a single blood pressure measurement was used to estimate control, the percentage of patients with controlled hypertension increased by 12.7% simply by changing the definition to include the level of systolic blood pressure = 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure = 90. When multiple blood pressure measurements were used for estimation control, the difference was much smaller (2.7%); When assessing the success of treatment for hypertension, defining blood pressure control as blood pressure < or = 140 mm Hg systolic and < or = 90 mm Hg diastolic results in significantly more people having controlled blood pressure than at < 140 mm Hg systolic and < 90 mm Hg diastolic. This difference is most likely the result of final digit preference. The use of several measures reduces this effect.

After week 12, doses were adjusted based on blood pressure to a maximum of 8 mg perindopril/2.5 mg indapamide or 40 mg enalapril. The key outcome parameters were overnight AER and supine blood pressure. Both treatments lowered blood pressure.

This study examined whether dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with both an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACE-I) and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) in type I is superior to any of the drugs alone in diabetics with diabetic nephropathy (DN). A randomized, double-blind, crossover study was conducted with 8 weeks of treatment with placebo, benazepril 20 mg once daily, valsartan 80 mg once daily, and the combination of benazepril 20 mg and valsartan 80 mg. Twenty type I diabetics with DN were included. At the end of each treatment period, albuminuria, 24-h BP and GFR were measured. Eighteen patients completed the study. The placebo values were: albuminuria [mean (95% CI)], 701 (490 to 1002) mg/24 h; Blood pressure [mean (SEM)] 144(4)/79(2) mmHg and GFR [mean (SEM)] 82 (7) mL/min per 1.73 m(2). Treatment with benazepril, valsartan, or dual blockade significantly reduced albuminuria and BP compared to placebo. Benazepril and valsartan were equally effective. Dual blockade induced an additional 43% (29 to 54%) reduction in albuminuria compared to either type of monotherapy and a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 6 (0 to 13) mmHg and 7 (1 to 14) mmHg (compared to to benazepril and valsartan) and a reduction of 7 (4 to 10) mmHg diastolic compared to both monotherapies.

To validate the results, we analyzed data from 619 patients in the V-HeFT II study.; 817 (42%) patients in the SOLVD study had a weight loss of 5% or more from baseline. At the 8-month follow-up, all weight loss cut-offs were significantly associated with impaired survival after adjusting for age, sex, New York Heart Association class, left ventricular ejection fraction, and treatment allocation.

We evaluated the time-effect profiles of ACE-I and ARB on urinary protein excretion and nitrate/nitrate (NO(x)) excretion in hypertensive (140 and/or 90 mmHg) patients with chronic kidney disease (serum creatinine < 265 (range , 44-265) micromol/L or creatinine clearance > 30 (range 30-121) mL/min). Patients with mild (<1 g/day; range 0.4-1.0) and moderate proteinuria (>1 g/day; range 1.1-6.9) were randomized to those treated with ACE-I and ARB Groups were assigned and treated with ACE-I (trandolapril or perindopril) or ARB (losartan or candesartan) for 48 weeks. In all groups, treatment with ACE-I or ARB reduced blood pressure to the same level but had no effect on creatinine clearance. In patients with mild proteinuria, neither ACE-I nor ARB altered urinary protein excretion. In patients with moderate proteinuria, ACE-I caused a 44 +/- 6% reduction in proteinuria at 12 weeks (from 2.7 +/- 0.5 to 1.5 +/- 0.4 g/day, n = 14), and this beneficial effect was sustained throughout the protocol (48 weeks, 1.2 +/- 0.2 g/day). In contrast, ARB did not result in a significant reduction in proteinuria at 12 weeks (23 +/- 8%, n = 13), but a 41 +/- 6% reduction in proteinuria was observed at 48 weeks. Similarly, increases in urinary NO(x) excretion were observed with ACE-I (from 257 +/- 70 to 1111 +/- 160 micromol/day) and ARB (from 280 +/- 82 to 723), although early (12 weeks) increases in urinary NO(x) excretion were observed +/- 86 micromol/day), the ARB-induced increase in NO(x) excretion was smaller than that by ACE-I (P<0 ,05). In conclusion, although both ACE-I and ARB lower blood pressure similarly, the effect of these agents on proteinuria in chronic kidney disease with moderate proteinuria is different. In ACE-I, a relatively early onset of the proteinuria-reducing effect was observed, which coincided with the increase in urinary NO(x) excretion. Conversely, ARB gradually decreased proteinuria and increased urinary NO(x) excretion. These time-course dependent changes in proteinuria and urinary NO(x) may reflect the pharmacological properties of ACE-I and ARB with respect to action on bradykinin.",0,0

Other antihypertensive therapies could also be added to achieve target BP (< 140/90 mmHg). The primary endpoint was the change in proteinuria during the six-month follow-up.; In the presence of similar blood pressure reductions and stable creatinine clearance values, the mean decrease in proteinuria was 0.5 + 1.7, 1.2 + 2.0, and 2.5 + 1.8 g/day in groups 1, 2, respectively and 3.

These risks are reduced by lowering blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. However, the association between blood pressure and vascular risk appears to be continuous, with no clearly defined blood pressure value below which the risks do not continue to decrease. Intensive glucose lowering in these patients has also been shown to reduce microvascular disease, but the impact on macrovascular disease remains uncertain.; ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular disease; preterAx and diamicroN-MR Controlled Evaluation) will investigate the hypotheses that intensive blood pressure lowering (using an angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor-diuretic combination) and glucose control in high-risk hypertensive patients or people without hypertension with type 2 diabetes reduce the incidence of vascular disease. The study also provides an opportunity to examine the effects of blood pressure reduction against a background of ACE inhibition in such patients.; This 2 x 2 factorial, randomized controlled trial will enroll 10,000 adults with type 2 diabetes and at increased risk of vascular disease from approximately 200 clinical centers in 20 countries worldwide. Eligible patients will be randomized to first the fixed combination of perindopril 2 mg/indapamide 0.625 mg, then perindopril 4 mg/indapamide 1.25 mg, or a matched placebo, and second to an intensive sulfonylurea-based glucose control regimen (target glycated hemoglobin [HbA(1c)] </= 6.5%) or usual guideline-based therapy. Any participant suspected of having ACE inhibition indicated will receive background therapy with perindopril. The planned duration of treatment and follow-up is 4.5 years.

In this randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the effect of simvastatin on coronary artery atherosclerosis was compared to that of placebo in 394 patients who underwent paired coronary angiograms a median of four years apart. The effects of treatment on the following predefined subgroups were assessed: gender, age (less than 65 years versus at least 65 years), smoking status (current or previous/never), history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension, and severity of coronary artery lesions (diameter at least 50 % versus less than 50%). Compared to placebo, there were significantly smaller decreases in mean minimum diameters between completion and baseline angiograms in all simvastatin-treated subgroups. Tendencies towards or significantly smaller decreases in average mean diameters and similar smaller increases in percent stenosis diameter were also observed in all subgroups. The slowing of angiographically detectable coronary atherosclerotic narrowing supports the claim that this treatment effect is causally related to the reduction in coronary events repeatedly observed in large clinical trials of lipid-lowering therapy. In addition, this treatment effect occurs in the presence or absence of traditional coronary risk factors.",0,0

If necessary, hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) was added to each compound. We evaluated flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent brachial artery dilatation (high-resolution ultrasound) versus endothelium-independent response to glyceryl trinitrate (25 micrograms/s). Brachial artery diameter was measured by automated computer-aided analysis. 40 healthy subjects were evaluated as a control group. The production of oxidative stress was assessed by measuring plasma malondialdehyde and plasma lipoperoxides; The antioxidant capacity of the plasma was evaluated as an iron-reducing antioxidant power. Hypertensive patients showed significantly (p<0.01) less flow-mediated dilatation (5.2 +/- 1.9%) compared to healthy controls (7.1 +/- 2.6%). The response to glyceryl trinitrate was similar in controls and patients. At baseline, blood pressure, diameter, flow-mediated dilatation, and response to glyceryl trinitrate were similar in the different treatment groups. All treatments reduced blood pressure similarly, but only perindopril increased flow-mediated dilatation (from 5.1 +/- 2 to 6.4 +/- 2.4%; P<0.01) without increasing the response to glyceryl trinitrate change.

Incomplete SNS suppression may contribute to residual mortality during optimal ACE inhibitor therapy in CHF. Carvedilol, a mixed alpha and beta blocker with antioxidant properties, and other pure beta adrenoceptor blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in Caucasians with CHF. However, beta-blocker monotherapy is of little effectiveness in black people with essential hypertension or in the treatment of glaucoma. The effectiveness of beta-blockers in treating African Americans with congestive heart failure is a controversial issue with conflicting results. The objectives of the present study were to investigate and compare the cardiovascular, autonomic, and clinical effects of additional alpha-1 or beta-1 blockade in ACE inhibitor-treated black patients with moderate to severe CHF; Twenty-eight Nigerian patients with chronic CHF stabilized on digoxin and diuretics were randomized into 3 groups with similar demographic characteristics using a single-blind, parallel-group design. Patients were 53 +/- 6 years old and included 14 males and 14 females with a mean cardiothoracic ratio of 0.66 +/- 0.03 and an ejection fraction of 0.38 +/- 0.10, 60% hypertensive etiology . Patients in group 1 received enalapril 5 mg alone, group 2 received enalapril 5 mg + prazosin 1 mg, and group 3 received enalapril 5 mg + atenolol 50 mg. All drugs were taken daily for 4 weeks. Blood pressure, heart rate, pressure rate product, 6-minute walk test, NYHA class, and cardiac autonomic reflexes were measured at baseline and again after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. A Two Way Repeated Measures ANOVA and a One Way ANOVA were used in data analysis.; The 3 treatments produced significant (P<0.001 ANOVA) and similar improvements for NYHA class (-1.0 to -1.6) and increased 6-minute distance covered (+130 m to +205 m). Although no treatment differences were observed, a trend was evident suggesting greater improvement with enalapril + atenolol. At the fourth week, the sympathoplegic treatments, enalapril + atenolol and enalapril + prazosin, caused significant reductions in the pressure rate product (-3726 +/- 1885 mm Hg x beats/min; -3498 +/- 396 mm Hg beats/min) (im Compared to enalapril alone (-1349 +/- 894 mm Hg x beats/min) (p < 0.001 ANOVA) During the Valsalva maneuver, phase IV bradycardias were significantly greater after treatment with enalapril + atenolol (944 +/- - 66 ms) or with enalapril + prazosin (825 +/- 48 ms) compared to enalapril alone (760 +/- 45 ms) (P<0.001 ANOVA) Phase II Valsalva tachycardias were similar between the two Ratio of respiratory sinus arrhythmias increased significantly (P<0.005 ANOVA) and equally across all treatments. However, pressor and chronotropic responses to forearm isometric handgrip increased significantly in the combination of enalapril + prazosin (P<0.02) compared to the other treatment en.; Our results demonstrated not only the safety of providing additional alpha-1 or beta-1 receptor blockade therapy concomitantly with ACE inhibition in blacks with CHF, but also the resulting improvement in exercise tolerance and NYHA class. Compared to use of ACE inhibition alone, the combined therapies caused a significant reduction in the pressure rate product, an index of myocardial oxygen consumption, and a greater enhancement in cardiac parasympathetic activity. Selective beta-1 blockade caused a greater increase in central baroreceptor vagal activity compared to alpha-1 blockade. Conversely, the pressor and chronotropic abnormalities during the isometric forearm maneuver in CHF were normalized by alpha-1 but not beta-1 blockade. Therefore, the combined reflex cardiac vagal augmentation after selective beta-1 blockade and the hemodynamic effects of alpha-1 antagonism with concomitant ACE inhibition in Blacks with non-ischemic (hypertensive) CHF stabilized on digoxin may be of great therapeutic and prognostic benefit and diuretics.",0,0

The main goal of treating hypertension in this population is to prevent or reduce the chance of damage to the target organ. The treatment goal for hypertension must therefore be defined based on optimal means of preventing cardiovascular and renal events. Reduction of hypertension by pharmacological therapy is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events, renal disease and associated mortality. However, many questions remain. Some of the basic and important questions include the following: What should be the goal of treating blood pressure in diabetics and are there any preferred agents that should be used in hypertensive diabetics? How do angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers go together? Are there advantages of one class over the other?

LV size, short-axis muscle area (mass) (LVMA), and function were quantified using 2D echocardiograms. The prevalence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and common ventricular ectopy (premature ventricular contractions [PVCs] > 10/h) was assessed using ambulatory ECG. VT and PVCs > 10/h occurred in 20% and 29% of patients at baseline, 22% and 35% at 1 year, and 23% and 39% at 2 years, respectively. VT and PVCs > 10/h at baseline and at 1 and 2 years were significantly associated with LV size, LVMA and function.

The following are the key messages(1) For those over 50 years of age, systolic blood pressure (BP) greater than 140 mmHg is a much more important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) than diastolic BP; (2) CVD risk, starting at 115/75 mm Hg, doubles with each 20/10 mm Hg increase; Individuals who are normotensive by age 55 have a 90% lifetime risk of developing hypertension; (3) Individuals with systolic blood pressure 120-139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 80-89 mmHg should be considered prehypertensive and need health-promoting lifestyle changes to prevent cardiovascular disease; (4) Thiazide-type diuretics should be used in the medical management of most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, either alone or in combination with drugs from other classes. Certain high-risk conditions are compelling indications for the initial use of other classes of antihypertensive drugs (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); (5) Most hypertensive patients require 2 or more antihypertensive drugs to reach goal BP (< 140/90 mm Hg or < 130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease); (6) If blood pressure is more than 20/10 mmHg above target blood pressure, consideration should be given to initiating 2-agent therapy, 1 of which should normally be a thiazide-type diuretic; and (7) The most effective therapy, prescribed by the most diligent clinician, will control hypertension only if patients are motivated. Motivation increases when patients have positive experiences with the doctor and trust him. Empathy creates trust and is a powerful motivator. Finally, in providing these guidelines, the Committee recognizes that the judgment of the responsible physician remains of paramount importance.",0,0

The primary endpoint was renal survival as estimated by a 50% increase in baseline SCr. Secondary endpoints were the presence of a SCr > 1.5 mg/dl at the last visit and the development of proteinuria. Baseline clinical findings were similar between the enalapril-treated and control groups at baseline, and there were no differences in blood pressure control during follow-up. The mean follow-up time was 78 +/- 37 months in the enalapril group and 74 +/- 36 months in the control group.

Recent experimental studies have demonstrated electrical and structural atrial remodeling with increased fibrosis in heart failure animals and suggested a preventive effect of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) on the development of atrial fibrillation. To verify the hypothesis that ACEi prevent the development of atrial fibrillation in heart failure patients, we performed a retrospective analysis of Montreal Heart Institute (MHI) patients enrolled in the Studies Of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD). Clinical charts were reviewed and serial ECGs interpreted by a single cardiologist blinded to drug assignment. Patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter at baseline were excluded. The baseline characteristics were taken from the SOLVD databases. The mean follow-up time was 2.9 +/- 1.0 years. Of the 391 patients randomized to MHI, 374 were in sinus rhythm at the time of random assignment, with 186 taking enalapril and 188 taking placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups, with the exception of a higher incidence of prior myocardial infarction in the enalapril group. 55 patients had atrial fibrillation during follow-up: 10 (5.4%) in the enalapril group and 45 (24%) in the placebo group (P<0.0001). According to Cox multivariate analysis, enalapril was the most powerful predictor of atrial fibrillation risk reduction (hazard ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.44; p<0.0001); Treatment with the ACEi Enalapril significantly reduces the risk of developing atrial fibrillation in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.",0,0

Because patients with heart failure and renal failure were underrepresented in these studies, little evidence is available to guide clinicians in the optimal management of patients with either condition. About one-third to one-half of heart failure patients have renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), and renal failure is one of the strongest predictors of mortality in heart failure patients. Evidence supports the use of ACE inhibitors to improve survival in patients with moderate renal disease (GFR, 30 to 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), but there is little evidence to support the risks and benefits in patients with advanced to consider renal dysfunction. Beta-blockers improve survival in patients with heart failure, and their beneficial effect is unlikely to vary with kidney function. Spironolactone improves outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure, but renal failure appears to increase the risk of hyperkalemia and limits the drug's use in patients with severe renal failure. Future heart failure clinical trials should include a representative number of patients with renal failure to improve the evidence base and outcomes in this vulnerable population.",0,0

We examined 468 patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension in the ABCD study (Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes). Patients were randomized in a stratified design to receive initial treatment with either enalapril or nisoldipine and either intensive or moderate treatment goals. We measured an electrocardiographic index for increased left ventricular mass, the adjusted Cornell voltage, serially by treatment group. The association between changes in electrocardiographic voltage and cardiovascular events was defined using Cox proportional hazards analysis.; At 5 years of follow-up, the reduction in adjusted Cornell tension was significantly greater in patients treated with enalapril than in patients treated with nisoldipine (analysis of repeated measures variance P=0.002). In Cox's proportional hazards model, treatment assignment (enalapril vs. nisoldipine) was the strongest predictor of cardiovascular events, but the presence of coronary artery disease at baseline, duration of diabetes mellitus, and changes in tension were also independent predictors of cardiovascular events. In the ABCD study, treatment with enalapril was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction.

Direct intervention costs were calculated from the contact time (planned and unplanned) spent by the MDC team. Unplanned hospitalization costs for heart failure were calculated using a daily rate of 242. Outcomes were quantified in monetary terms, ie cost of service per hospitalization prevented and net cost/savings at 3 months.; The MDC team's direct intervention costs were 5860, with a mean cost per patient of 113 (95% CI: 97-128). At 3 months, there were a total of 12 unplanned heart failure readmissions in the RC group (25.5% rate, 195 days) compared to 2 in the MDC group (3.9% rate, 17 days). The number of treatments to avoid hospitalization for heart failure was 6 over 3 months. The cost of the service per prevented hospitalization was 586. The intervention resulted in a net cost saving of 37,216 for 51 patients treated over 3 months. Sensitivity analyzes using 50% cost variation and lower relative risk reductions confirmed the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.; HF's MDC remains cost-effective when combined with optimal medical care. The significant clinical and cost benefits suggest that this intensive approach to MDC and medical management should become the standard of care for heart failure.",0,0

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) provides effective blood pressure reduction and renal protection in patients with hypertensive diabetes. Despite this, it can be difficult to achieve recommended blood pressure levels, and dual-blockade therapy may be a possible route to achieve effective blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients with diabetes. Dual blockade treatment is based on the principle of achieving the broadest and most efficient blockade of angiotensin II by using the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB.

Studies have shown that insulin resistance precedes the development of hypertension. By improving insulin sensitivity, it may be possible to improve high blood pressure and the resulting damage to the vessel walls. Some data indicate beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on insulin sensitivity and endothelial function. Our aim was to investigate these effects of ACE inhibition in the same group of patients with essential hypertension.; Nine non-smoking, untreated hypertensive patients (38.3+9 years, 4/5 male/female) and 12 age-matched healthy volunteers (35.2+6.7 years, 5/7 male/female) were included in the study. Patients with hypertension received enalapril maleate (5-40 mg/day) for six months. The following parameters were assessed at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured by a formula derived from an oral glucose tolerance test called the Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI). Insulin was measured by chemiluminescence and glucose by a glucose oxidase method. Endothelial function was assessed as flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery by ultrasound and expressed as percent change relative to baseline diameter. Endothelium-independent vasodilation was measured after sublingual nitroglycerin administration.; FMD was impaired in the hypertensive group compared to healthy subjects (7.3 + 3.1% vs. 15.3 + 4.8%, p<0.0005) and ISI values were 1.18, respectively +0.6 vs 4.4 +0.9 (p<0.0001).

We compared short-term and 1-year blood pressure response by BMI category and weight change with hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, diltiazem-SR, captopril, clonidine, prazosin, or placebo in 1292 male veterans. Drug doses were titrated to achieve a target diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg over 4-8 weeks. Patients who achieved goal blood pressure were retained for 1 year. BMI predicted no change in systolic, diastolic, or pulse pressure during titration for any drug. At 1 year, obese patients (BMI > 30) were 2.5 times more likely to have diastolic blood pressure controlled by atenolol than normal weight (BMI < 27) patients (p=0.01). Only prazosin patients gained weight: 1.7 lb (end titration, p<0.0001; 1 year, p=0.02). Obesity does not appear to cause resistance to antihypertensive drugs.",0,0
1198,12826783,Achievement of blood pressure goal in patients with type 2 diabetes: conventional versus fixed-dose combination approaches.,,"Bakris, George L; Weir, Matthew R","Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) shows that only 11% of people with diabetes who are being treated for hypertension achieve the blood pressure goal of <130/85 mm Hg recommended in the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC VI). The current study tests the hypothesis that initial therapy with a fixed-dose combination achieves the recommended blood pressure goal in patients with type 2 diabetes faster than conventional monotherapy. The primary endpoint of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was achieving a blood pressure of <130/85 mmHg. Participants (N=214) with hypertension and type 2 diabetes received either amlodipine/benazepril 5/10 mg (combination) or enalapril 10 mg (conventional) once daily for 4 weeks, titrated to 5/20 mg/day or 20 mg /day or at this time if the target blood pressure was not reached. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg/day was added for the last 4 weeks if target BP was still not met. The time from baseline to BP < 130/85 mm Hg was shorter in the combination group (5.3 +/- 3.1 weeks combination vs. 6.4 +/- 3.8 weeks conventional; p=0.001 ). At 3 months, more participants in the combination group achieved the treatment goal (63% combination vs. 37% conventional; p=0.002). Data analysis at 3 months comparing blood pressure control rates between the fixed-dose combination group (no HCTZ) and the conventional combination group (receiving HCTZ) revealed an even greater discrepancy in BP goal attainment (87% combination without HCTZ vs. 37% with conventional treatment). group with HCTZ; p=0.0001). We conclude that initial fixed-dose combination therapy may be more effective than traditional monotherapy approaches in achieving blood pressure goals in diabetics. A fixed dose combination approach appears to be as safe as the current conventional approaches.",0,0
1199,12827019,Role of I1-imidazoline receptors within the caudal ventrolateral medulla in cardiovascular responses to clonidine in rats.,,"Wang, Wei-Zhong; Yuan, Wen-Jun; Ren, An-Jing; Pan, Yan-Xia; Tang, Chao-Shu; Su, Ding-Feng","Although it is recognized that imidazoline receptors play an important role in the central regulation of cardiovascular activities, little is known about their role in the caudal ventrolateral medulla. In urethane-anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats, we used antagonists of the I1-imidazoline receptor or alpha2-adrenoceptor to assess the function of these receptors in the caudal ventrolateral medulla in controlling the cardiovascular effects of clonidine. Unilateral microinjection of clonidine (6 nmol/50 nl) into the caudal ventrolateral medulla significantly (P<0.01) increased blood pressure and discharge of the presympathetic neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla, while heart rate was unchanged. Microinjection of yohimbine (a selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, 500 pmol/50 nl) into the caudal ventrolateral medulla did not alter blood pressure, heart rate, or the discharge of the presympathetic neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla and failed to attenuate the local caudal ventrolateral medulla Clonidine-induced blood pressure increase. However, unilateral microinjection of idazoxan (a mixed imidazoline receptor and alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, 2 nmol/50 nL) into the caudal ventrolateral medulla significantly (P < 0.01) reduced mean arterial pressure, heart rate and discharge of the rostral ventrolateral Medulla presympathetic neurons and completely eliminated the pressor effects of clonidine. In addition, bilateral microinjection of idazoxan (4 nmol in 100 nL for each side) into the caudal ventrolateral medulla effectively (P<0.01) blocked the depressant effects of intravenous clonidine (5 and 50 micrograms/kg). These results confirm that I1-imidazoline receptors within the caudal ventrolateral medulla are involved in the maintenance of tonic cardiovascular activities and in the pressor effects of clonidine in the caudal ventrolateral medulla. In addition, the caudal ventrolateral medulla appears to play an important role in the antihypertensive effects of systemically administered clonidine in rats.",0,0

We have measured serum concentrations of macrophage colony stimulating factor in patients with acute myocardial infarction and also the effects of early administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on circulating macrophage colony stimulating factor levels in these patients examined. Patients were randomized into 3 therapeutic groups; perindopril, candesartan, and control groups (without perindopril and candesartan), and the drugs were administered within 24 to 36 hours after the onset of acute myocardial infarction. Serum macrophage colony-stimulating factor concentrations were significantly higher in patients with acute myocardial infarction at the time of admission than in healthy controls. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor levels in patients gradually decreased after admission but remained significantly higher than controls for 14 days. During this study period, there were no significant differences in serum macrophage colony stimulating factor levels between the 3 therapeutic groups. In summary, levels of circulating macrophage colony-stimulating factor are elevated during the course of acute myocardial infarction and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers does not affect these levels.",0,0
1201,12832683,Effects of captopril administration on pulmonary hemodynamics and tissue oxygenation during exercise on ACE gene subtypes in patients with COPD: a preliminary study.,,"Kanazawa, H; Hirata, K; Yoshikawa, J","We have previously shown that the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) DD genotype is associated with excessive pulmonary hypertension and tissue oxygenation disorders during exercise in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A pilot study was designed to investigate the effects of captopril on these exercise-related variables in COPD patients categorized by ACE gene polymorphisms.; Thirty-six patients with COPD (II=13, ID=11, DD=12) received oral captopril (25 mg) or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design and underwent right heart catheterization with stress.; Mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and post-exercise lactate concentration were higher in patients with the DD genotype than in patients with the II or ID genotypes for both placebo and captopril. In contrast, the mixed venous oxygen pressure (PvO(2)) was lower in patients with the DD genotype than in patients with the other genotypes. In addition, post-exercise mPAP, PVR and lactate concentrations in the captopril group were lower than in the placebo group in patients with the II or ID genotype, but not in those with the DD genotype. Post-exercise PvO(2) was higher in patients with genotype II on captopril than on placebo, but not in patients with the other genotypes.; These results suggest that pulmonary hemodynamic variables and tissue oxygenation status during exercise depend on ACE genotypes and that captopril administration effectively affects these exercise-related variables. Although the sample size in this pilot study was limited, it is likely that improvement in exercise-related variables in genotype II COPD patients is relatively sensitive to captopril.",0,0

The influence of the antihypertensive effect in some studies could also contribute to this inconclusiveness. To examine the possibility of differential benefit depending on the underlying kidney disease, we conducted a crossover therapy study of combination therapy in two selected homogeneous patient groups with diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease. The antihypertensive effect was excluded during the study. 19 biopsy-proven IgA nephropathies as examples of non-diabetic kidney disease and 24 patients with diabetic type 2 nephropathy were selected as study participants. Subjects had to meet the following criteria: a creatinine clearance (Ccr) between 25 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, a 24-hour urinary protein excretion rate greater than 1.0 g/day, and a sustained blood pressure less than that than 130/80 mmHg, with more than 6 months of ramipril therapy (5.7 +/- 0.4 mg/day, 13 +/- 2 months). The baseline data between the two groups showed no significant differences. After a 12-week stabilization phase (control phase), candesartan 4 mg once daily (combination phase) followed by placebo (placebo phase) or vice versa was administered in addition to ramipril for 12 weeks. The combination with candesartan did not alter CCR, BP, serum and urine electrolytes, or urea. The protein excretion rate in the 24-hour urine was significantly reduced by the combination therapy in the patients with IgA nephropathy (3.1 +/- 0.3 g/day in combination, 4.2 +/- 0.3 in the control and 4.3 +/- 0.2 in placebo; p<0.05). However, the patients with diabetic nephropathy showed no reduction in their proteinuria with the combination therapy (3.8 +/- 0.2 g/day in combination, 3.9 +/- 0.3 in control and 4.1 +/- 0 .3 in placebo; p=NS) . The changes in proteinuria showed no association with the changes in blood pressure in IgA nephropathy. In conclusion, the benefit of the combination therapy differed between IgA and diabetic nephropathy due to its antiproteinuric effect during the 12-week study. The difference in the pathophysiological role and importance of the renin-angiotensin system between the two diseases could contribute to the discrepancy in the outcome. We suggest that distinguishing underlying kidney disease among study participants is an important requirement for future studies on this topic.",0,0

In other studies, they showed similar antihypertensive effects and similar reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared to conventional antihypertensive drugs, with the exception of a higher incidence of heart failure and fatal myocardial infarction in some studies. However, given all the evidence available today, these drugs should be considered safe for treating patients with uncomplicated hypertension in combination with other drugs. They can also be used as first-line therapy for older, stroke-prone hypertensive patients. In addition, if a calcium channel blocker is indicated for better blood pressure control, its use should not be withheld for safety reasons.",0,0
1205,12844464,Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy is a key goal of hypertension management.,,"Zhang, Rubin; Crump, Judy; Reisin, Efrain","Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with hypertension is associated with an increased risk of many cardiovascular events and predicts a higher mortality rate. The pathogenesis of LVH is complicated. In addition to hemodynamic stress (pressure or volume overload) and demographic factors, several trophic humoral factors such as angiotensin II, aldosterone, endothelin, leptin, and catecholamines may also contribute to the development and progression of LVH. Effective antihypertensive therapy can reverse LVH and prevent its development. Regression of LVH reduces subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Commonly used drugs have different effects on LVH. Angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors appear to be the most effective. Several new agents, including direct antifibrotics, aldosterone blockers, vasopeptidase inhibitors, and endothelin receptor antagonists that more specifically target the underlying pathogenesis of LVH, may provide us with innovative approaches to treat LVH.",0,0

Evidence-based medicine data has been provided by many large multicenter studies and strongly supports not only the promise of an effective treatment to delay the progression of target organ involvement, but also the potential for reversal. These dramatic therapeutic improvements have been made possible by linking the pathophysiological disease mechanisms involved with the actions of pharmacological agents.

1207,12844467,Lessons learned from studies in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes.,,"Ruilope, Luis M","There is indisputable evidence that the association of type 2 diabetes with hypertension significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular events, death and nephropathy. In type 2 diabetes, even blood pressure values that are typically below the threshold for hypertension (ie 140/90 mmHg) in non-diabetics pose an additional risk of clinical relevance. Evidence that more intensive blood pressure lowering is more beneficial in type 2 diabetes than a less intense sink is also overwhelming. However, most published studies indicate the need for combination therapy in the vast majority of patients, and even with combination therapy, it is difficult to achieve expected blood pressure goals, particularly systolic blood pressure goals. It should be noted that the goal of systolic blood pressure of less than 130 mm Hg is very difficult to achieve in diabetics. The evidence for the superiority or inferiority of different drug classes is vague and conflicting. Recent evidence on angiotensin II receptor antagonists has shown a significant reduction in cardiovascular events, cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality when losartan was compared to atenolol but not when irbesartan was compared to amlodipine. When renal endpoints are included, the evidence for the benefit of angiotensin II receptor antagonists in type 2 diabetes is more robust than that available for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The primary prevention of the development of microalbuminuria appears to be greatly facilitated by strict blood pressure control. However, achieving normal blood pressure values (< 130/80 mm Hg) does not seem to ensure better maintenance of the glomerular filtration rate.",0,0

The data clearly show that lowering blood pressure is the most important aspect of treating hypertension and that all agents are similarly effective. There is currently little sustained evidence of non-pressure benefits for any class of drugs. Therefore, by combining these results with additional information on blood pressure and safety goals, and on the use of aspirin and statins, we can formulate health care policies that address hypertension in a holistic, risk-based manner. The future will focus on delivering additional patient benefits by testing the efficacy and superiority of drug combinations using novel agents that favorably impact intermediate markers such as arterial stiffness and reverse the ever-increasing burden of cognitive impairment and dementia.",0,0
1209,12844471,Recent clinical studies with omapatrilat: new developments.,,"Zanchi, Anne; Maillard, Marc; Burnier, Michel","Omapatrilat belongs to the group of vasopeptidase inhibitors, ie drugs that have the ability to simultaneously inhibit membrane-bound zinc metalloproteases, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11 (NEP). Omapatrilat was specifically used to treat patients with high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. The preclinical and early clinical studies conducted with omapatrilat have been very promising. In fact, omapatrilat appeared to be a very potent antihypertensive drug with very beneficial effects on cardiac function in patients with heart failure. In contrast to these early studies, the large clinical trials were more disappointing. The results of the OCTAVE study confirmed the antihypertensive efficacy of omapatrilat, but at the cost of an angioedema rate that was more than three times higher than that of an ACE inhibitor in the overall population (2.17% vs. 0.68%) and almost in the overall population four times higher black population. In OVERTURE, a large randomized controlled heart failure study, angioedema was also more common with omapatrilat, but the incidence was much lower (0.8% with omapatrilat vs. 0.5% with enalapril). However, omapatrilat was not convincingly superior to ACE inhibitors. Since angioedema is likely a class of vasopeptidase inhibitors, the higher incidence of this potentially life-threatening complication with omapatrilat likely halted the development of this new class of drugs. The future of vasopeptidase inhibitors will depend on the ability to improve the benefit-risk balance, either through the development of agents that induce less angioedema, or by better defining a high-risk population susceptible to dual ACE/NEP inhibition could benefit.",0,0

However, there is controversy about their effectiveness in patients with small infarcts and preserved LV systolic function. The aim of the present study was to detect the influence of the ACE-I perindopril on global LV performance in patients with pure inferior AMI (AMI-I) using a Doppler-derived index (DI) measuring systolic and diastolic time intervals combined (Tei index). Our study included 40 patients with first AMI-I, mean age 60 years +/- 9.06 years (SD) and 24 age- and sex-matched normal patients who formed the control group (COG). Patients were randomized into two groups to receive conventional treatment with AMI-I (GCT) or the above therapy plus P (GP). Complete Doppler echocardiography (systolic and diastolic parameters), DI and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were measured at day 8.07 +/- 1.16 (SD) after the infarction. The same study was done with COG. The DI was significantly lower in healthy patients (0.45 +/- 0.23) compared to the value in patients with GP (0.56 +/- 0.03; P = 0.023) or GCT (0.78 +/- - 0.05; P = 0.000). In addition, DI was higher in patients with GCT than in GP patients (P=0.000). Furthermore, administration of perindopril shortened the isovolumic relaxation time (IRT; 120.00 +/- 4.23 vs. 139.00 +/- 6.74; p=0.006) and significantly prolonged the ejection time (ET; 274.25+ /- 7.35 vs 253.50 +/- 7.68; P=0.042). SBP in GP patients was similar to GCT (120.5 +/- 2.85 mmHg vs. 112.5 +/- 3.49 mmHg; P=NS); Global LV function (DI) is impaired in patients with AMI-I. Administration of perindopril has a beneficial impact on LV performance in patients with AMI-I, which is achieved through an improvement in diastolic function (IRT), which indirectly improves LV systolic function (ET, DI). This positive influence of perindopril is the result of the drug's direct tissue action and not its hemodynamic effect.",0,0

1214,12865039,The BErgamo NEphrologic Diabetes Complications Trial (BENEDICT): design and baseline characteristics.,,,"Microalbuminuria is an early marker of diabetic nephropathy and its prevention is considered key to the primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have specific renoprotective properties in diabetes, and there is preliminary evidence that they are more effective in combination than either agent alone in limiting albuminuria in either micro- or macroalbuminuric type 2 diabetics. The BErgamo NEphrologic Diabetes Complications Trial (BENEDICT) is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study primarily aimed to assess the possibility of reducing the progression of microalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion rate [UAE] 20-200 micrograms/min, i.e. incipient nephropathy) in 1209 hypertensive type 2 diabetics with a normal UAE frequency (< 20 micrograms/min). During Phase A of the study, patients will be randomized to receive 3 years of treatment with one of the following: (1) a non-dihydropyridine CCB (Verapamil SR 240 mg/day); (2) an ACE inhibitor (trandolapril 2 mg/day); (3) the combination of the above study drugs (verapamil SR 180 mg/day plus trandolapril 2 mg/day); or (4) placebo. Phase B of the study will assess progression to macroalbuminuria (UAE > or = 200 micrograms/min) in patients who progress to microalbuminuria in Phase A or who have microalbuminuria during the screening phase; These patients will be randomized to receive 2 years of treatment with either trandolapril (2 mg/day) alone or verapamil SR (180 mg/day) plus trandolapril (2 mg/day). The final results of BENEDICT are expected to be available by the end of 2003 for phase A and two years later for phase B. In addition to exploring whether primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy is an achievable goal, the BENEDICT study will also provide an opportunity to study prospective risk factors for nephropathy and other chronic complications of type 2 diabetes.

There was a slight reduction in 24-h systolic/diastolic ABP by 3/2 mmHg (-2 to 8 systolic, -2 to 5 diastolic; NS). Changes in albuminuria did not correlate with changes in arterial blood pressure. The addition of 16 mg candesartan daily induced a small, insignificant decrease in GFR of 4 (-1 to 9) ml x min (-1) x 1.73 m (-2); Dual blockade of the RAS provides superior short-term renoprotection independent of systemic blood pressure changes compared to the maximum recommended doses of ACEI in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.",0,0

A diuretic may be added; Thiazide diuretics, but not indapamide, have been associated with adverse metabolic effects. Whether these effects also apply to thiazides when administered at the lower doses currently used, and whether they differ in their metabolic effects from indapamide, particularly when used in combination with an ACE inhibitor in diabetics, has not been investigated .; We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, endpoint, crossover study comparing metabolic responses to the addition of either hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or indapamide in 18 diabetic hypertensive patients receiving ACE inhibitor monotherapy for hypertension.

Although the mechanism of action of the two classes of drugs is not very similar, there is no evidence of differences in their clinical effects. Importantly, the risk reduction achieved with both drugs is not similar in subgroups of diabetics. Overt nephropathy of type 2 diabetes appears to respond poorly even to maximized inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. This urgently requires new interventions that can reduce renal and cardiovascular risk through mechanisms other than lowering blood pressure alone.

Despite the use of available RAAS blockers, aldosterone has been overlooked as a mediator of RAAS onset and as a key factor in target organ injury. Aldosterone is believed to play a role in the development of hypertension, changes in vascular structure, vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction, structural kidney damage, proteinuria, left ventricular remodeling, collagen synthesis and myocardial fibrosis. Aldosterone receptor antagonists have been shown to counteract all of these effects in experimental models. Clinical trials with aldosterone antagonists have shown an improvement in survival time and left ventricular mass index in patients with congestive heart failure, and a reduction in urinary protein excretion and left ventricular mass index in patients with type 2 diabetes and early nephropathy who developed aldosterone synthesis escape. Consequently, aldosterone receptor antagonists may have specific benefits for reducing target organ injury, particularly when there is evidence of RAAS escape.",0,0
1229,12948435,What is the dose of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in patients with diabetic nephropathy?,,"Weinberg, Marc S; Kaperonis, Nicholas; Bakris, George L","Angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), two classes of drugs that potently block the action of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), have unique abilities as antihypertensives. Recent landmark clinical studies have demonstrated its important role as a first-line therapy for the prevention of kidney disease in diabetes. The optimal dosage of these RAS blockers required to slow the progression of kidney disease or to reduce the development of cardiovascular risk is not known. However, data from many studies strongly support the use of higher doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs to reduce proteinuria. All studies of kidney disease progression show a benefit of slowing it down only if blood pressure is lowered when higher doses are used. To obtain the optimal benefit from ACE inhibitors and ARBs, the dose-response relationship for diabetic kidney disease needs to be determined. The best strategy, ie supramaximal doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs or their combination, is still controversial but may soon be clarified by results of ongoing studies.",0,0

This manuscript provides an overview of the renal outcomes of studies that have included calcium channel blockers in the treatment of patients with and without renal disease.

1232,12963858,Treatment of hypertension in the elderly: an updated look at the role of calcium channel blockers.,,"Kostis, John B","High blood pressure is common in adults over the age of 60. Next to age, hypertension is the strongest predictor of cardiovascular end-organ damage and associated morbidity and mortality. Although diastolic blood pressure is considered an important risk factor, it is now clear that systolic blood pressure, particularly in older adults, is a better predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Less than 30% of hypertensive patients have blood pressure values < 140/90 mm Hg as recommended by current guidelines. Controlled studies have shown the benefits of lowering blood pressure for all hypertensive patients, including those 65 years of age or older. Calcium channel blockers of the dihydropyridine subclass, which include nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine, and nitrendipine, among other drug classes, are potent antihypertensive agents that may be useful in the management of hypertension in older adults. However, as with all antihypertensive drugs, side effects may limit their use; Peripheral edema is particularly troublesome for dihydropyridines. Newer dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, expected to be approved for use soon, including lercanidipine and lacidipine, have been associated with efficacy comparable to currently available calcium channel blockers but with a lower incidence of side effects, particularly ankle edema.

Of all patients, 16 men and 6 women, age 45 +/- 13 years, diabetes duration 19 +/- 11 years, insulin dose 38 +/- 11 U/day, 10 were normotensive and 12 were hypertensive. After a 3-month run-in period, patients were assigned to treatment with enalapril 5 mg or 10 mg based on the presence of normotonia or hypertension, respectively. Before and after 6 months of treatment, renal function was assessed by assessing glomerular filtration rate (99m Tc-DTPA), renal plasma flow (131-I-iodohippurate), filtration fraction and renal vascular resistance. Mean arterial pressure, albumin excretion rate, urinary urea excretion and glycated hemoglobin were also determined.; Administration of enalapril resulted in a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure, albumin excretion rate, glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction and renal vascular resistance in both patient groups. A decrease in albumin excretion did not correlate with a decrease in systemic blood pressure or filtration fraction. No significant fluctuations in renal plasma flow, urea excretion, or glycated hemoglobin were observed.; Our results suggest that low doses of enalapril effectively affect renal hemodynamics and reduce urinary albumin excretion in both normotensive and hypertensive type 1 diabetics (insulin dependent) with incipient or established nephropathy.

A 3-week wash-out period was included between treatment periods. Blood pressure on the first and last days of the placebo treatment period (137 +/- 7 (SD)/80 +/- 8 and 139 +/- 11/81 +/- 9 mmHg) was similar to the corresponding values during the ketoprofen therapy (136 +/- 10/79 +/- 7 and 143 +/- 10/81 +/- 9 mmHg).

1235,1345141,Hypertensive retinal vascular changes: association with left ventricular hypertrophy and arteriolar changes before and after treatment.,,"DahlÃ¶f, B; Stenkula, S; Hansson, L","Fundus photographs were taken in twenty-eight previously untreated men with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The same eye was examined before and after 26 weeks of double-blind treatment with enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide. The vascular changes were assessed using a more elaborate and refined grading than the Keith-Wagener-Barker scale. All photos were examined by the same observer without knowledge of blood pressure, type of treatment, or the order in which the photos were taken. There were significant positive correlations between the vascular changes in the retina in the untreated condition and the left ventricular wall thickness (echocardiography), the minimal vascular resistance in the calf (plethysmography) and blood pressure. Treatment with enalapril significantly decreased retinal artery wall reflection and did not significantly reduce arterial narrowing and arteriovenous crossing phenomena. Hydrochlorothiazide did not affect any of the retinal vascular changes. It can be concluded that this relatively simple technique of evaluating fundus photographs using a new rating scale when applied to non-malignant hypertension provides a useful assessment of the extent of hypertensive target organ damage both in the retina and in other important target organs, i.e. the heart and the vascular beds. In addition, unlike hydrochlorothiazide, enalapril has a beneficial effect on hypertensive retinopathy, reflecting what is happening with structural cardiovascular changes in the rest of the body.",0,0

The subjects were classified according to standard Swedish criteria. Ambulatory blood pressure (amb-BP) was recorded in a sample of normotensive and borderline hypertensive subjects, and in all untreated hypertensive subjects identified at screening and willing to participate. A subset of borderline hypertensive patients also performed self-measurements of blood pressure (self-BP) both at work and at home. The antihypertensive efficacy of atenolol 50 mg once daily and enalapril 20 mg once daily was compared in hypertensive subjects at rest, during the 24 hour period, and during dynamic and isometric exercise. The efficacy of enalapril and lisinopril (two ACE inhibitors with different durations of action) was also compared, with a particular focus on the early morning hours.; Men and women classified as normotensive differed significantly from those with hypertension, even when blood pressure was measured using ambulatory technology. The number of correctly classified subjects did not differ between self-BP and office BP; the combination of the two added little. Atenolol reduced blood pressure during dynamic exercise better than enalapril, while there was no significant difference in effect between enalapril and lisinopril even 18-24 hours after dosing.; More comprehensive blood pressure measurements should be considered when evaluating treatment for hypertension.

1237,1345261,Structural cardiovascular changes in essential hypertension. Studies on the effect of antihypertensive therapy.,,"DahlÃ¶f, B","These studies were conducted to evaluate different manifestations of structural cardiovascular changes and the effects of antihypertensive therapy in essential hypertension. A meta-analysis of 109 studies examining the effect of different pharmacological antihypertensive therapies on left ventricular structure was examined using echocardiography to increase statistical power, remove uncertainties, and improve the accuracy of estimating the magnitude of effect. Strict predetermined criteria were applied. Using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), the effect of different drugs in monotherapy and in particular of first-line antihypertensive therapies was compared. ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers all reduce left ventricular mass (LVM) through a reduction in wall hypertrophy, with the effect being most pronounced with ACE inhibitors. Conversely, diuretics reduced LVM primarily by decreasing left ventricular volume. Previously untreated men (n = 28, 86 kg, 46 years, 27 kg/m2) with non-malignant essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 95 mmHg 3-4 times (triple) on placebo) were randomized to long-term Double-blind treatment with enalapril (E) or hydrochlorothiazide (H). There were no significant differences between the groups at baseline. Vascular changes of the retina (fundus photograph, refined grading), cardiac morphology (M-mode echocardiography, ASE), structural vascular changes of the hand (plethysmography, minimum resistance (Rmin)), total peripheral resistance ((TPR), calculated from dye dilution) and blood pressure ( intra-arterial) were significantly associated at baseline, with the exception of LVM and Rmin. After 6 months of therapy, E reduced signs of vascular changes in the retina and Rmin in hand circulation, while H did not change or increase these structural vascular changes. The blood pressure lowering effect of E (mainly by lowering TPR) tended to be more pronounced than that of H (mainly by lowering cardiac output) as measured both intra-arterially and indirectly, but there were no significant differences. LVM progressively decreased with E, while the effect of H was not significant. E reduced wall thickness but not left ventricular diameter and also significantly improved left ventricular compliance. The effect on cardiac morphology was significantly different between therapies when blood pressure change was accounted for. After the longest follow-up on monotherapy (18 months), E had reduced LVM by 2.7 g/mmHg and H (14 months) by 1.3 g/mmHg (significant only for E). In univariate analysis, changes in cardiovascular structure were significantly associated with changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).",0,0

The analysis was intended to treat.; The mean age of the patients was 60 years (SD 9), 85% were male, 92% were taking antiplatelets, 62% beta-blockers and 58% were taking lipid-lowering therapy. 603 (10%) placebo and 488 (8%) perindopril patients met the primary endpoint, which is a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI 9-29, p=0.0003) with perindopril. These benefits were consistent across all pre-specified subgroups and secondary endpoints. Perindopril was well tolerated.; In patients with stable coronary artery disease without obvious heart failure, perindopril can significantly improve outcome. About 50 patients need to be treated over a 4-year period to prevent a major cardiovascular event. Treatment with perindopril should be considered in addition to other preventive medications in all patients with coronary artery disease.",0,0

This study compared LVH regression during treatment with the selective aldosterone blockers eplerenone, enalapril and their combination in patients with hypertension.; A 9-month, double-blind, randomized study was conducted in 202 patients with LVH and hypertension who received eplerenone 200 mg daily, enalapril 40 mg daily, or eplerenone 200 mg daily and enalapril 10 mg. At week 8, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg and/or amlodipine 10 mg was added if diastolic blood pressure was > 90 mmHg. The primary endpoint was change in left ventricular (LV) mass as assessed by MRI. Changes in blood pressure, hormones of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, albuminuria and safety were also assessed. Eplerenone significantly reduced LV mass from baseline (-14.5+/-3.36 g; n=50), similar to enalapril (-19.7+/-3.20 g; n=54; P= 0.258), but eplerenone/enalapril (-27.2+/-3.39 g; n=49) was more effective than eplerenone alone (P=0.007).

This conclusion was based solely on an analysis of secondary endpoints and costs. As reflected in the dictum to “Use thiazides for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension” in the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension, this interpretation of ALLHAT broadly suggests these guidelines.

Patients were randomized to receive different doses of enalaprilat (0.625, 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg). Response to treatment was defined as a stable reduction in systolic blood pressure below 180 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg within 45 minutes of starting treatment and symptomatic relief in patients with hypertensive emergencies.; The treatment goal was achieved in 41 (63%) of 65 patients. Twenty-four (37%) patients did not achieve their treatment goal within 45 minutes of enalaprilat administration. The response rates in the 0.625 mg, 1.25 mg, 2.5 mg and 5 mg groups were 67%, 65%, 59% and 62%, respectively. The proportion of initially randomized patients who responded to treatment did not differ in any of the four enalaprilat dosing groups. There were no significant differences by enalaprilat dose in changes in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. No serious side effects were observed.; Enalaprilat is a safe antihypertensive drug with moderate efficacy in the management of hypertensive crisis. Because doses greater than 0.625 mg do not alter response rates or the extent of blood pressure reduction, we recommend 0.625 mg as the starting dose in the management of hypertensive crisis.",0,0

Exercise capacity was measured on two different types of treadmill exercise, one with a ramp protocol and the other with a fixed workload. Corridor walking tests at three self-selected speeds were also conducted, and measurements of usual activity were assessed using pedometer readings.; Exercise times were significantly increased for both treadmill protocols after 12 weeks of drug treatment from baseline (P<0.01), with a positive correlation between treadmill exercise duration for both protocols (r=0.69, P<0.01). Corridor walk tests of 100 m at a self-selected slow pace also improved (P<0.02), but these did not correlate with changes in treadmill exercise time. Heart failure patients' pedometer scores were greatly reduced compared to controls (258 (45) x 10(2) vs. 619 (67) x 10(2) steps/week, P < 0.001) and after 12 weeks of treatment remained unchanged (261 (42) x 10(2) steps/week).; These data confirm the need to use different exercise protocols when evaluating the benefit of drug treatment in patients with chronic heart failure. Treatments that appear effective with traditional laboratory-based exercise tests may not improve daily activities. This may reflect failure of an apparently successful treatment and should be taken into account when interpreting clinical trials.",0,0

Study on Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Treatment of Hypertension.,,"Staessen, J A; Bieniaszewski, L; Buntinx, F; Celis, H; O'Brien, E T; van Hoof, R; Fagard, R","The US Food and Drug Administration developed the trough-to-peak ratio as a tool for evaluating long-acting antihypertensive drugs, but ratios are usually reported without accounting for inter-subject variability. This study examined how the trough-to-peak ratio is affected by inter-subject and intra-subject variability and by smoothing daily blood pressure profiles. Ambulatory blood pressure was recorded in 143 hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure when measured conventionally > 95 mm Hg) on placebo. After 2 months, recordings were repeated with 10 mg (n=66) or 20 mg (n=77) lisinopril once daily between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. Baseline-adjusted trough-to-peak ratios were determined from daily blood pressure profiles with 1-hour precision. Lisinopril reduced (+/- SD) 24-hour pressure by 16 +/- 17 mm Hg for systolic and 10 +/- 10 mm Hg for diastolic (P < 0.001). Using the usual approach, without accounting for inter-subject variability, the trough-to-peak ratio was 0.72 for systolic pressure and 0.67 for diastolic pressure. In the 143 patients, the ratios were not normally distributed. They were the same for both lisinopril doses. Adjusting for inter-subject variability, the median trough-to-peak ratio was 0.34 (P5 to P95 interval, -0.46 to 0.87) for systolic pressure and 0.26 (-0.44 to 0 .84) for the diastolic pressure. In 66 patients examined twice with 10 mg lisinopril with a mean interval of 32 days, the trough-to-peak ratios were characterized by large intra-subject variability.",0,0

This open-label study in 19 patients with a variety of renal diseases complicating hypertension evaluated the effects of the ACEI, enalapril, on hemoglobin and plasma erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations. Blood samples were taken at baseline and 2, 60 and 120 days after the start of treatment with enalapril. On day 60, there was a significant decrease in mean hemoglobin concentration (mean decrease 7.4 g/L) that persisted through day 120. Except for a small but significant decrease on day 2, the mean plasma EPO concentration remained constant throughout the study. However, the magnitude of the decrease in hemoglobin concentration correlated significantly with baseline plasma creatinine concentration and creatinine clearance. These results suggest that the degree of renal impairment is important in determining the hematological response to ACE inhibition. While the mechanism of these changes remains unclear, our results suggest that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system may decrease the hormone's erythropoietic activity rather than decreasing EPO production.",0,0

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of perindopril-based antihypertensive therapy on the ratio of median thickness to lumen diameter (media:lumen) of peripheral resistance vessels and left ventricular mass in essential hypertension. 25 patients with newly diagnosed or poorly controlled essential hypertension were treated with perindopril. Inadequate response to treatment (DBP > 90 mmHg) led to the addition of isradipine, and hydralazine was used as a tertiary drug when needed. Gluteal subcutaneous biopsies were surgically taken at baseline and after 9 months of successful treatment. Two small resistance arteries were isolated and mounted in a small vessel myograph, and the media:lumen ratio (%) was measured under standardized conditions. The left ventricular mass was determined by echocardiography. The mean (SD) media:lumen ratio decreased from 9.8 (2.6)% to 7.8 (1.9)% (p<0.05), while left ventricular mass increased from 299 (75) g 199 (53) g (p<0.001). A correlation was found between changes in left ventricular mass index and media:lumen ratio (r = 0.62, p < 0.01).

None of these have been used in patients with type II diabetes mellitus, where it has been suggested that the desired blood pressure should be lower than in non-diabetics. This multi-centre study was designed to investigate whether there is a difference in the efficacy of a first-line antihypertensive drug when assessed by casual and ambulatory blood pressure determinations in patients with type II diabetes mellitus who are eligible for 24-hour ambulatory monitoring confirmed or unconfirmed diagnosis of hypertension. Forty-three patients (mean age, 57.7 years) with stable type II diabetes mellitus and mild hypertension (occasional diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mm Hg on at least two visits) were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (benazepril, 10 to 20 mg once daily) for 8 weeks. The effectiveness of the antihypertensive drug was assessed by occasional (trough) and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Diabetics were classified as unconfirmed hypertension if the mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic pressure was less than 85 mm Hg. Antihypertensive treatment significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic pressures when measured either by occasional measurement (from a mean of 162.7/98.0 to 153.9/89.2 mmHg; p<0.001) or by ambulatory monitoring (from a mean of 143.1/84.4 to 137.0/81.5 mm Hg, p<0.05).

Felodipine, a vasoselective dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a slow onset of action and a long plasma half-life, may be such an agent. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of felodipine were studied and compared to enalapril in a double-blind design. We studied 46 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.40, a maximum oxygen consumption < 20 ml.min-1.kg-1 and CHF symptoms despite therapy with diuretics and digoxin. After 16 weeks of therapy, there were no statistically significant differences in maximal oxygen consumption (felodipine +1.6, enalapril +2.5 ml.min-1.kg-1) and exercise tolerance (felodipine +61 seconds, enalapril +64 seconds). Quality of life parameters were slightly better affected by felodipine than by enalapril. Plasma norepinephrine decreased by 143 pg.ml-1 with enalapril and by 12 pg.ml-1 with felodipine (p<0.20 between groups). Both drugs were generally well tolerated.

However, a more marked improvement in glucose tolerance was evident in hypertensive patients presenting with glucose intolerance and/or insulin resistance (GI/IR, 53.8% of all). This subgroup also showed a slight but not significant increase in HDL cholesterol and a decrease in triglyceride levels. Little or no change in plasma glucose, insulin and lipid levels has been observed in hypertensive patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and insulin sensitivity. These favorable effects were only seen after ACE inhibitor monotherapy, but not with the additional administration of hydrochlorothiazide.

Relatively low doses of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are now routinely used in ischemic heart disease, the leading cause of heart failure. Therefore, we examined the hemodynamic interaction between ASA and captopril in heart failure.

Captopril alone significantly reduced blood pressure (BP) and ICG clearance. Calf blood flow remained unchanged. However, after arterial occlusion, the hyperemic calf perfusion lasted longer. Captopril alone did not significantly alter plasma levels of the vasodilating prostaglandins PGI2 and PGE2 or the vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2 (TXA2). In contrast, captopril in combination with ASA reduced plasma levels of these vasoactive substances, with significant decreases in PGE2 and TXA2 compared to captopril alone, yet the hemodynamic changes after captopril plus ASA were similar to those observed after captopril alone.

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced by treatment with either verapamil or enalapril, and heart rate was slightly but significantly reduced by both treatments. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein were significantly reduced by both treatments. High density lipoprotein levels were significantly increased in verapamil recipients but not in enalapril recipients. Adverse reactions occurred in 37 (3.9%) patients receiving prolonged-release verapamil and 25 (2.7%) patients receiving enalapril.

1275,7512487,"Lowering blood pressure. How far, how fast?",,"Roca-Cusachs, A","There is general consensus that hypertension (BP) needs to be lowered gradually. Lowering blood pressure beyond the limits of the autoregulatory curve can impair blood flow to vital organs and lead to organ ischemia. However, lowering high blood pressure provides protection from cerebral events and some protection from coronary artery disease. The limited protection from coronary artery disease by lowering blood pressure can be partially explained by the so-called “J-shaped curve”: lowering diastolic blood pressure below 85 mmHg can lead to a paradoxical increase in coronary events, although this is by no means established. In addition, the incidence of several cardiovascular disease-related events peaks in the morning hours, at a time when some antihypertensive drugs are least effective. This can also explain the limited coronary protection after administration of antihypertensive drugs.",0,0

1280,7516858,The clinical potential of renin inhibitors and angiotensin antagonists.,,"Cody, R J","The renin-angiotensin system makes a significant contribution to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure and hypertension. For this reason, attempts to specifically block this system have been a pharmacological target for over 25 years. Blockade of the renin system has been attempted at 3 key sites: the rate-limiting angiotensinogen-renin step, the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and the active receptor sites for the end products of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Converting enzyme inhibitors have been successfully studied and used in clinical cardiovascular disease, but questions remain regarding the specificity of their action. Therefore, other, more specific approaches are still being evaluated. Inhibition of renin's action on angiotensinogen has been demonstrated with early inhibitory peptides and in experimental studies with specific antibodies. Most currently available renin inhibitors are non-peptide, which nonetheless require intravenous administration. An oral renin inhibitor with clinical effects was investigated in early human studies. Like renin inhibitors and converting enzyme inhibitors, specific angiotensin antagonists have been studied early in the course of pharmacological blockade of the renin system. Early angiotensin antagonists were limited because of the need for intravenous administration and because of their short half-lives. They also had the potential for mixed agonistic/antagonistic physiological and pharmacological effects that could result in a pressor rather than depressant response. The angiotensin receptor antagonists have the appeal of blocking the specific receptor at its target tissue site, analogous to other well-described systems. Newer angiotensin antagonists do not have the limitations of the precursor peptides. Losartan (DUP753) is a specific angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist. It is orally active with no agonistic activity and has high receptor binding properties. Early studies suggest that it is a specific probe of the renin system and provide newer insight into the role of the renin system in cardiovascular disease. New clinical studies show that it is effective for lowering blood pressure and as a vasodilator. Aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone have been available for decades. Spironolactone is being used in an ongoing study to assess the effects of combined converting enzyme and aldosterone inhibition. Newer aldosterone antagonists could complement the targeted blockade of aldosterone without the adverse effects of the precursor compound and the potential for combined blockade of the specific renin system.",0,0

1282,7521831,race and high blood pressure. What is clinically relevant?,,"Rutledge, D R","Hypertension, once thought to be rare in Africa, is common in most black populations outside the continent, as well as in more urban areas of Africa. The incidence of high blood pressure among black Americans is among the highest in the world. Pathophysiological mechanisms suggest that the incidence of salt-sensitive blood pressure is higher in black patients. More black than white patients initially present with volume expansion. However, in black patients there does not appear to be a significant relationship between plasma renin activity, plasma volume and blood pressure. Insulin resistance syndrome has also been reported in African Americans. Future studies should address this issue both because it relates to identifying individuals at risk of developing hypertension and because it impacts the initial selection of antihypertensive therapy. Hypertensive kidney disease is common in black people. Lowering blood pressure with diuretic-based therapies has not been shown to delay or prevent loss of kidney function in patients with this condition, suggesting that this treatment approach may not be optimal. Lifestyle changes remain the initial therapeutic regimen. Because diuretics and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in controlled clinical trials, they are preferred therapies. The hypertension detection and follow-up program demonstrated a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality in black patients using primarily diuretic-based therapies. However, controversy regarding the use of diuretics remains, as some researchers believe that greater reductions in overall cardiovascular risk may be achieved in black patients using other agents. These agents may have beneficial cardiovascular effects in addition to and independent of their antihypertensive effects. Long-term data documenting reduced morbidity and mortality rates with other agents are needed for all populations, particularly black hypertensive patients.",0,0
1283,7523058,Stress testing in heart failure. A critical review.,,"Swedberg, K","Exercise intolerance is one of the hallmarks of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Therefore, stress tests have been widely used in the assessment of CHF patients, both to define disease severity and to assess the efficacy of pharmaceutical agents in clinical trials. A variety of stress tests can be used, although the maximum stress test is the most common. Maximum exercise capacity can be determined by measuring exercise duration during increasing exercise, maximum oxygen consumption (O2), or estimated from anaerobic threshold. While baseline exercise tests in CHF patients accurately identify and quantify heart failure and determine prognosis, they are of limited value in assessing changes that occur as a result of drug therapy. A major disadvantage of exercise testing as a measure of drug effect is the fact that changes in stress caused by drug intervention do not correlate well with changes in mortality rates. Several examples of the lack of correlation between exercise testing and mortality rates have been observed in clinical trials of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and vasodilators. ACE inhibitors have a modest effect on maximal exercise capacity but improve survival. Neuroendocrine activation is thought to better reflect mortality rates and also changes in survival observed with pharmacological intervention compared to other assessment methods.",0,0

This prompted us to evaluate the efficacy of this combination in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer unresponsive to hormone therapy.; Estramustine 15 mg/kg/d and VP-16 50 mg/m2/d were administered orally in divided doses for 21 days. The patients were then withdrawn from therapy for 7 days and the cycle then repeated. Therapy continued until evidence of disease progression.; 42 patients were enrolled in this study with a minimum follow-up of 40 weeks. Of 18 patients with measurable soft tissue disease, three had a complete response (CR) and six had a partial response (PR) for more than 2 months. Of these 18 patients, pre-treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels decreased by at least 75% in five men (28%) and at least 50% in nine (50%). Median survival was not reached in patients who responded on either soft tissue or PSA criteria. Of 24 patients with bone-only disease, six (25%) showed improvement and nine (38%) showed stability in their bone scans. Five men (21%) had a decrease in pre-treatment PSA levels of at least 75% and 14 (58%) a decrease of at least 50%; median survival was not reached in these patients. Performance status before treatment is an important predictor of survival.; We conclude that the combination of estramustine and VP-16 is an active oral regimen in hormone-refractory prostate cancer.",0,0
1285,7525196,trandolapril. A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use in essential hypertension.,,"Wiseman, L R; McTavish, D","Trandolapril is a non-sulfhydryl prodrug that is hydrolyzed in the liver to its active diacid, trandolaprilat, after oral administration. Trandolaprilat is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and exhibits similar pharmacodynamic properties to other ACE inhibitors, thereby improving haemodynamic and cardiac parameters in patients with essential hypertension. Trandolapril 2 to 4 mg once a day is effective in controlling blood pressure for at least 24 hours in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In a small number of double-blind comparative studies, trandolapril had a similar antihypertensive effect as atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and delayed-release nifedipine, but was more effective than captopril. Combination therapy with trandolapril and delayed-release hydrochlorothiazide or nifedipine had a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than treatment with either drug alone. Further comparative studies are warranted to confirm these preliminary results. The safety profile of trandolapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors, with most side effects being generally mild and transient in nature, and trandolapril has no side effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Therefore, with its favorable pharmacological profile and antihypertensive activity similar to that of agents currently used to treat patients with mild to moderate hypertension, trandolapril is likely to be a well-tolerated option for the treatment of this disease. The results of ongoing and future clinical trials will determine its potential as a cardioprotective agent in patients following myocardial infarction.",0,0

To answer this question, the database of the recently reported international double-blind study ""Xamoterol in Severe Heart Failure"" was examined. Of 516 New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV patients despite diuretic and ACE inhibitor therapy, 352 were randomized to xamoterol, a partial beta-1 agonist, and 164 to placebo. During the 13-week study, 28% of all patients (xamoterol 104; placebo 42) received potassium-sparing diuretics. All groups were comparable in hemodynamics and dose of other diuretics. At the end of the study, patients with or without PSD showed no significant differences in serum K+ or creatinine, regardless of xamoterol or placebo therapy. The mortality rate was consistently lower: 4.6% in patients with PSD and 8.5% in patients without PSD, although statistical significance was not reached. Compared to baseline, the K+ values of 6 patients with and 17 patients without PSD had increased by > 5.0 mM at the end of the study (p = NS); 1 patient with and 11 patients without PSD had a creatinine value > 180 microM (p = NS). In 3 patients who received PSD and 2 patients who did not receive PSD due to renal impairment, the study was discontinued due to hyperkalemia. No significant differences were found with long-acting and short-acting or different doses of ACE inhibitors.

Two hundred patients (aged 25 to 74 years) with a seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 114 mmHg after 4 weeks of treatment with HCTZ 25 mg once daily were randomized to placebo or moexipril 3.75, 7.5 mg or 15 mg allocated. Blood pressure was measured 22-26 h after dosing at biweekly visits and 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after the first dose of double-blind medication. At endpoint, the adjusted mean reduction from baseline in seated DBP was 8.4, 8.8, and 8.9 mmHg in the moexipril 3.75, 7.5, and 15 mg groups, respectively, compared to a reduction of 4.6 mmHg in the placebo group (p=0.003). The differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP) reductions at all nadir time points were statistically significant in favor of each of the moexipril groups versus the placebo group. The adjusted mean changes in seated blood pressure were 10.9, 12.0, and 11.7 mmHg, respectively, compared to a 0.6 mmHg reduction in the placebo group (p<0.001).

1288,7527326,quinapril. A reassessment of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in cardiovascular disease.,,"Plosker, G L; Sorkin, E M","After systemic absorption, quinapril is converted by deesterification to quinaprilat (the active diacid metabolite), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Pharmacodynamic studies in animals indicate inhibition of ACE both in plasma and at tissue sites such as the arterial wall and heart following administration of quinapril. Tissue ACE inhibition may be an important component of the mechanism of action of quinapril (and other ACE inhibitors) to produce beneficial effects in cardiovascular disease. Quinaprilat has a short elimination half-life (approximately 2 hours) but binds tightly to and slowly dissociates from ACE, allowing once or twice daily dosing of quinapril in the management of patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure. Quinapril 10 to 40 mg/day has achieved adequate blood pressure control in most patients with essential hypertension in clinical trials. Some patients required quinapril doses up to 80 mg/day and/or concomitant diuretic therapy. Titration of quinapril dosages from 10 to 40 mg/day increased response rates without increasing the incidence or severity of side effects. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to quinapril therapy improved response rates by approximately 10 to 20% in patients with hypertension. In general, blood pressure control with quinapril monotherapy was comparable to that achieved with enalapril or other standard antihypertensive drugs in comparative studies. Quinapril < or = 40 mg/day improved exercise tolerance, reduced symptom severity and frequency, and improved functional class (New York Heart Association) in most clinical trials of patients with congestive heart failure. Furthermore, the beneficial haemodynamic and echocardiographic changes achieved with quinapril were maintained for up to 1 year with continued administration to such patients, but its effect on survival in patients with congestive heart failure has not been reported. The safety profile of quinapril is broadly similar to that of other ACE inhibitors; Pooled clinical trial data showed that 12% of patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure who received quinapril experienced treatment-emergent adverse reactions, compared with 15% of enalapril recipients and 16% of captopril recipients. Thus, quinapril has clearly established itself as an effective and well-tolerated alternative to other ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. While the effects of quinapril on survival in patients with congestive heart failure have not been determined, large intervention studies have shown improved mortality rates with other ACE inhibitors. Further studies, including a large ongoing study in normotensive patients with coronary artery disease but normal left ventricular function, may also establish a role for quinapril in the treatment of patients with ischemic heart disease.",0,0

We treated 48 hypertensive patients with either nitrendipine (10-20 mg bid, bid) or captopril (25-50 mg bid) for 16 weeks to reduce changes in plasma catecholamines, platelet alpha-2 and to assess lymphocyte beta-2 adrenoceptors. Blood pressure (BP) decreased from 153/95 to 135/87 mm Hg with captopril and from 155/99 to 137/89 mm Hg with nitrendipine. Treatment with nitrendipine significantly stimulated plasma norepinephrine (NE) from 327 +/- 37 to 446 +/- 50 pg/ml, and treatment with captopril resulted in a significant reduction in platelet alpha-2 adrenoceptor density from 265 +/- 39 to 171 +/- 26 fmol/mg protein. Despite having the same antihypertensive properties, captopril and nitrendipine have different effects on the sympathetic nervous system. The stimulation of plasma NE during long-term treatment with nitrendipine may contribute to possible side effects, while the captopril-induced reduction in alpha-2-adrenoceptors may contribute to the vasodilator effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition.",0,0

Lisinopril induced a dose-dependent (significant after 20 mg) and long-lasting (< or = 8 h) decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP, approximately 11% after 20 mg) associated with a decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR) because simultaneously heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (CO) were unchanged. Arm artery flow (+42 and +47% after 5 and 20 mg, respectively) and diameter (+8 and +9%) increased significantly, while arm vascular resistance (-31 and -38%) decreased significantly from 2 to 8 h after drug intake. Common carotid flow (+20 and +24%) also increased significantly, while the corresponding resistance (-18 and -26%) decreased significantly over the same period. Finally, following both lisinopril doses, CO was significantly redistributed towards the brachial and, to a lesser extent, the carotid vascular beds. We conclude that lisinopril dilates both arterioles and large arteries in non- or slightly hypotensive doses in healthy subjects and that this vasodilation is non-homogeneous and affects the brachial rather than the carotid vascular bed.",0,0

1292,7533694,Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in Raynaud's phenomenon.,,"Challenor, V F","Patients with Raynaud's phenomenon present with reversible digital vasospasm, often in response to cold. While this condition often responds to simple physical measures, in severe cases the symptoms may require drug treatment. Arterial vasodilators have usually been tried in clinical practice, but recently ACE inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials of this disease. Case, non-comparative, and placebo-controlled studies have shown mixed results of ACE inhibitor therapy in Raynaud's phenomenon. While these drugs reduced symptoms in some patients, the results were not consistent. Even with objective improvement measures, such as e.g. B. the evaluation of digital blood flow patterns, no consistent statistically significant changes were found. However, no well-conducted dose titration studies have been conducted in patients with Reynaud's phenomenon, and the objective methods for assessing this condition need to be refined. The mode of action of ACE inhibitors is promising and these agents have no significant side effects in this population. While ACE inhibitors cannot currently be recommended for the routine treatment of Reynaud's phenomenon, further controlled trials of newer ACE inhibitors, which may have improved peripheral activity, could change this view.",0,0
1293,7537194,doxazosin. An update of its clinical pharmacology and therapeutic applications in hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia.,,"Fulton, B; Wagstaff, A J; Sorkin, E M","Doxazosin is a long-acting alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist structurally related to prazosin and terazosin. Its antihypertensive effect is produced by reducing the tone of the smooth muscles of the peripheral vascular beds, resulting in a decrease in total peripheral resistance without a significant impact on cardiac output or heart rate. In benign prostatic hyperplasia, the action of doxazosin to relieve bladder outflow obstruction is mediated by a reduction in prostatic tone mediated by alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade. In most comparative studies, doxazosin was found to be as effective as the comparator drug in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. It has been used in a wide variety of patient populations, including the elderly, blacks, smokers, and patients with concomitant disease states such as renal dysfunction, hypercholesterolemia, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and respiratory disease. Doxazosin has also been used successfully in combination with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, diuretics, calcium channel antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with hypertension not controlled by monotherapy. Doxazosin has a beneficial effect on some of the risk factors associated with coronary artery disease, including elevated serum lipid levels, impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance and left ventricular hypertrophy. Slight decreases in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and triglycerides are observed with doxazosin therapy, while small increases in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and the ratio of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol to total cholesterol are consistently reported will. Some studies have reported an improvement in glucose tolerance, although this effect has been observed more consistently in non-diabetic patients than in patients with NIDDM. In addition, doxazosin produces a similar reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy as other antihypertensive drugs. Model calculations indicate that doxazosin significantly reduces the risk of developing coronary artery disease in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, although this has yet to be confirmed in long-term prospective studies. Doxazosin appears to be a promising agent in the treatment of urinary tract disorders associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Similar to other alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonists, treatment with doxazosin results in increases in peak and mean urinary flow rates and improves other objective and symptomatic measures.",0,0

The daily dose of enalapril was increased as needed from 10 to 20 to 40 mg and that of nifedipine from 40 to 60 to 80 mg at 4-week intervals during the 12-week titration period. Blood pressure, 24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UAE), biochemistry, and serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity were measured at -6, -4, 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. At week 0 venous blood samples were also taken for baseline concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide, renin, aldosterone and serum insulin in plasma; At week 12, the mean daily dose of enalapril was 35 +/- 11.4 mg and 27 (57%) patients received the maximum daily dose of 40 mg. In the nifedipine group, the mean daily drug dose was 50 +/- 12.9 mg and 4 (8%) received the maximum daily dose of 80 mg.

Sodium and fluid retention is a well-documented phenomenon in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), but it is unknown whether diabetes-associated changes in cortisol metabolism contribute to its pathogenesis. Therefore, we assessed some aspects of cortisol metabolism by measuring urinary metabolites of cortisol and cortisone in eight microalbuminuric and eight normoalbuminuric IDDM patients and eight matched controls. In both IDDM groups, overnight excretion of tetrahydrocortisol (THF), allo-tetrahydrocortisol (allo-THF), and tetrahydrocortisone (THE) was lower than in the control group (P<0.05 to P<0.01). Both the allo-THF/THF ratio, a parameter of the 5-alpha/5-beta reduction of cortisol, and the ratio of cortisol to cortisone metabolites (THF+allo-THF/THE), which indicates the overall direction of cortisol -to-cortisone conversion were lower in the IDDM groups (P<0.05 to P<0.01). In the combined subjects (n=24), allo-THF, allo-THF/THF, and THF+allo-THF/THE were inversely correlated with hemoglobin A1c (r=-0.69, P<0.001; r=-0.61 , P<0.01 and r=-0.58, P<0.01). Upper arm segmental blood volume, estimated by an electrical impedance method, was correlated in both controls (r=0.77; P<0.05) and IDDM patients in whom it was measured (r=0.56) , positive with the ratio of cortisol to cortisone metabolites ; P<0.05; n=13), whereas the regression line was shifted to the left in IDDM (ie, a lower ratio for the same blood volume; P<0.03, by analysis of covariance). In seven microalbuminuric IDDM patients, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (10 mg daily for 6-12 weeks) produced a modest further reduction in the cortisol-to-cortisone metabolite ratio (P<0.05). The present data suggest chronic hyperglycemia-related impairment of the reduction of corticosteroids to tetrahydro-metabolites and an imbalance in 11-beta-HSD. Altered 11-beta-HSD activity is unlikely to be primarily responsible for sodium and fluid retention in IDDM. Furthermore, an additional mechanism of action of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition could be provided through an effect on 11-beta-HSD activity.",0,0

All patients were New York Heart Association functional class II, III, or IV and remained symptomatic despite optimal dosing with digoxin and diuretics. After 12 weeks of therapy, the improvement in treadmill exercise time was greater in the lisinopril group (113 seconds) than in the placebo group (86 seconds). This improvement in exercise duration was particularly evident in patients with left ventricular ejection fractions less than 35% (lisinopril = 130 seconds; placebo = 94 seconds). In patients receiving lisinopril, the increase in exercise duration was accompanied by an improvement in quality of life as measured by the Yale Dyspnoea/Fatigue Index and signs and symptoms of heart failure. In addition, the lisinopril group had a greater mean increase (3.7%) in left ventricular ejection fraction compared to the placebo group (1.3%). Thus, lisinopril administered once daily for 12 weeks was well tolerated and effective in the treatment of heart failure when co-administered with diuretics and digoxin.",1,0

Data on costs, utilities (health-related quality of life weights), and 4-year survival were obtained directly from the SAVE study, and long-term survival was estimated using a Markov model. In a number of analyses, we assumed that the survival benefit associated with captopril therapy would persist beyond 4 years (analyses showing sustained benefit), while in another group we assumed that captopril therapy would have a cost but none Survival benefit beyond 4 years (limited benefit analyses). analyses).; In the limited benefit analyses, the incremental cost-effectiveness of captopril therapy ranged from $3,600/quality-adjusted life-year for 80-year-old patients to $60,800/quality-adjusted life-year for 50-year-old patients. In the analyzes of sustained benefit, incremental benefit ratios ranged from $3,700 to $10,400 per quality-adjusted life-year, depending on age. The result was generally not sensitive to changes in estimates of variables when varied individually over wide ranges. In a worst-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for captopril therapy for 60- to 80-year-old patients remained favorable ($8,700-29,200/quality-adjusted life-year) but were higher ($217,600/quality-adjusted life ). -year) for 50-year-old patients.; We conclude that the cost-effectiveness of captopril therapy for 50- to 80-year-old myocardial infarction survivors with a low ejection fraction compares favorably to other interventions for myocardial infarction survivors.",0,0

All subjects were placed on a standardized sodium diet. After water loading (2290 mL in 3 1/2 h), they completed a 30-minute baseline and 30-minute exercise period (competitive video game). 69% of the subjects increased (“eliminators”) and 31% decreased (“retainers”) their sodium excretion under stress. In addition to increased potassium excretion (p<0.006), shedders also showed less stress-related increases in systolic (p=0.055) and diastolic (p=0.040) blood pressure and demonstrated greater expression of anger (p<0.02) than retainers. The same subjects were also studied to determine the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (captopril 25 mg twice daily) on sodium excretion. With captopril, excretors now showed retention of sodium (p < 0.001) and potassium (p < 0.01) under exercise and no longer differed significantly in blood pressure reactivity. The results suggest that there are two distinct stress-related patterns of renal sodium excretion, that these patterns are related to blood pressure responses to stress, and may be related to the expression of anger. In addition, sodium excretion patterns can be altered under stress by certain types of antihypertensive drugs.",0,0

A washout period of 3 weeks was observed between placebo and lisinopril. In each patient, a euglycemic glucose clamp combined with indirect calorimetry allowed us to determine whole-body glucose output and substrate oxidation. Changes in morning SBP and DBP were also determined. Compared to placebo, lisinopril significantly improved whole-body glucose utilization (40.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 30.3 +/- 0.4 µmol/kg LBM x min; P<0.01), non- oxidative glucose metabolism (18.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 10.9+). /- 0.6 mumol/kg LBM x min; P < 0.01) and fasting plasma potassium levels (4.8 +/- 3 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.4 mmol/L; P < 0.05).

T/P ratios were calculated by three different methods: directly from the curves that averaged all individual 24-hour profiles (A); Averaging all individual T/P ratios after averaging ABPM data for each patient over either 1-hour (B) or 3-hour (C) intervals. Methods B and C produced different T/P values that were significantly higher in Method C for each drug. For Method A, nifedipine appeared to have the higher T/P. For methods B and C (which, unlike method A, allowed statistical comparisons), the differences between nifedipine and the other drugs were not significant. Meanwhile, Method B appears to be closest to FDA guidelines by taking greater account of inter-individual variability in blood pressure profile. Therefore, we propose that accurate guidelines are needed for measuring T/P based on ABPM, while comparing between drugs requires both the mean of T/P and its variance to be determined.",0,0

The rate of decline was faster in participants with ADPKD than in those with other diagnoses, due in part to faster disease progression in the ADPKD group. Baseline characteristics that predicted a more rapid decrease in GFR in individuals with ADPKD were higher serum creatinine (independent of GFR), greater urinary protein excretion, higher mean arterial pressure (MAP), and younger age. In patients with baseline GFR values between 25 and 55 mL/min per 1.73 m2, neither assignment to a low-protein diet group nor assignment to a low blood pressure group significantly reduced the rate of GFR decline in ADPKD participants. Likewise, the decrease in GFR was unrelated to achieved protein intake or MAP. For participants with GFR values between 13 and 24 ml/min per 1.73 m2, assignment to the low MAP group resulted in a slightly faster decline in GFR. However, the more rapid decline in GFR did not appear to be due to an adverse effect of low blood pressure or the antihypertensive drugs used to achieve the low blood pressure goal. Lower protein intake, but no prescription of the keto acid amino acid supplement, was marginally associated with slower kidney disease progression.",0,0

Captopril 25 mg (or placebo) was administered twice, ie in the evening (10:00 p.m.) and the following morning (8:00 a.m.) before a maximum symptom-limited bicycle stress test (11:00 a.m.). Captopril reduced resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.01) without inducing reflex tachycardia. Time to onset of ST depression was prolonged (p<0.05) and peak ST depression was reduced (p<0.02). No differences were found between captopril and placebo in terms of total exposure time or time to onset of angina pectoris. The effects of captopril on exercise-induced ischemia have been demonstrated most clearly in patients who responded with a fall in resting systolic blood pressure of more than 10 mmHg. In conclusion, this study suggests that captopril has anti-ischemic properties that may be of importance in the management of patients with chronic stable angina and normal left ventricular function. These beneficial effects are likely related to a reduction in afterload and myocardial wall tension and therefore a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand.",0,0
1323,7585774,Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors after myocardial infarction.,,"Young, J B","Results from SOLVD, SAVE, AIRE, GISSI-III, ISIS-IV and the Chinese Captopril study suggest that ACE inhibitor therapy, at least enalapril, captopril, ramipril and lisinopril, produces a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality rates in patients with ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction and a wide spectrum of ventricular function and myocardial infarction. In particular, the SOLVD and SAVE results demonstrate improved survival and fewer severe ischemic events in patients with compromised ventricular systolic function. SOLVD cautions that initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy does not have to occur immediately after a myocardial infarction to achieve benefit. GISSI-III and ISIS-IV, on the other hand, suggest that the use of ACE inhibitors early after myocardial infarction confers significant, albeit small, benefits when drugs are used early after the event in conjunction with other routinely used therapeutic strategies. The prospective, well-designed, and well-controlled nature of these clinical trials, the consistency of their results, and the high level of morbidity and mortality in placebo groups demonstrate the importance of preventing ischemic events with the prescribed ACE inhibitors. Of particular importance is the fact that none of these clinical trials were designed to determine the optimal dose or dosing frequency of the chosen ACE inhibitors. Target dose principles were applied, and clinicians wishing to achieve similar results in their own patient population should select one of the ACE inhibitors studied and administer it in the manner described, with the hope of achieving results similar to those described in the pooled clinical studies. Finally, recommendations for post-myocardial infarction therapy with ACE inhibitors can be summarized. Ventricular function should be evaluated in patients with acute or distant infarction. All patients with decreased systolic function, whether symptomatic or not, should receive a trial with an appropriate ACE inhibitor. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, ventricular function should be assessed early and, if the ejection fraction is low (probably < 50%), an appropriately selected ACE inhibitor should be started after 24 hours. ACE inhibitor therapy should be initiated in combination with other proven effective treatment strategies after myocardial infarction. In patients with normal systolic function, the benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy are less clear, but patients with a large anterior wall myocardial infarction are likely to benefit even without objective evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Concomitant use of thrombolytics, aspirin and beta-blockers should not preclude the use of ACE inhibitor therapy.",0,0
1324,7585859,Meta-analysis of three studies of quinapril for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in the Mexican population.,,"Alcocer, L; Novoa, G; Sotres, D","meta-analysis was performed to investigate the therapeutic effect of quinapril in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Data from three clinical studies conducted in Mexico, involving a total of 426 patients, were analyzed using a retrospective approach and statistical methods. The meta-analysis demonstrated that quinapril elicited positive diastolic and systolic responses at all doses studied, particularly the 10 mg dose. At this dose, 94.1% of patients reduced their diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 10 mm Hg or achieved a DBP < or = 90 mm Hg. Overall, quinapril reduced DBP by 14.8 to 24.8 mmHg proportional to DBP start of studies. Systolic blood pressure decreased by 16 from baseline to 35.7 mm Hg. We conclude that the meta-analysis allowed for clearer and more reliable handling of the results regarding efficacy and optimal dose of quinapril.",0,0

The aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamic left ventricular responses to acute volume overload by continuous radionuclide monitoring in patients with asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.; Left ventricular end-diastolic (EDV) and end-systolic (ESV) volumes, ejection fraction (EF), and peak filling rate (PFR) were monitored before and during volume expansion with a radionuclide detector (Vest) (sodium chloride, 0.9%, 0.25 mL. kg-1.min-1 for 2 hours) in 10 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and mild heart failure (New York Heart Association class I or II, ejection fraction < 50%). Patients were evaluated off treatment and after 6 to 8 weeks of oral treatment with enalapril (5 mg/day). A control group of 11 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (N group) was also studied. In the N group, volume loading caused an immediate and sustained increase in EDV, EF, and PFR (all P<0.001), while ESV was progressively reduced (P<0.001) and heart rate and blood pressure did not change. In contrast, EDV in DCM showed a smaller increase than in the N group (Two-Way ANOVA: F=5.98, P<0.001), ESV increased (P<0.001), and EF and PFR remained unchanged. Cardiac adaptations to volume loading were normal after enalapril. Specifically, EDV, EF, and PFR increased (P<0.001) and ESV was reduced (P<0.001). In 6 additional DCM patients studied before and after 6 to 8 weeks of placebo treatment, left ventricular responses to volume loading were unchanged. The dynamic adaptation of the left ventricle to an acute volume overload is impaired in patients with idiopathic DCM and mild heart failure. These impaired reactions are improved by treatment with enalapril.",0,0

In a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, 22 patients received 1.5-2.0 mg captopril/h iv, while 24 patients received placebo. Medication was started between 2 and 18 hours after the onset of the infarction. The two groups were matched according to age, location of the infarction and time of the intervention. All but one patient in each group were administered nitroglycerin concurrently. The necrosis parameters were provided by the quantitative measurement of the QRS complex. The Q wave decreased with captopril treatment (-0.003 mV) but increased with placebo (+0.14 mV, p<0.05). The number of ventricular extrasystoles 24 h after the start of treatment was 25/h with placebo and 9/h with captopril (p<0.02). Ventricular fibrillation occurred seven times in the placebo group but not in the captopril group. Creatine kinase infarct weight was 59 gram equivalents (gEq) with placebo and 45 gEq with captopril (p=NS). Mean arterial pressure was reduced by 12 mmHg under captopril treatment. The results demonstrate a beneficial effect of captopril on infarct size and electrical instability, over and above the effect of standard treatment with nitroglycerin and thrombolysis.",0,0

Recently, the approach to treating adult hypertension has been modified to reflect advances in understanding individual patient risk factors and the relative risk of cardiovascular complications. In addition, there are currently no data showing a benefit of acute blood pressure lowering in asymptomatic patients with severe hypertension, but there is data that suggests it may be harmful, particularly in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.

Relationships to hemodynamic indices and effects of ACE inhibition.,,"Foy, S G; Crozier, I G; Richards, A M; Nicholls, M G; Turner, J G; Frampton, C M; Ikram, H","To determine the neurohormonal response to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition after acute myocardial infarction, 36 patients presenting within 6 hours of the onset of chest pain were evaluated at a single regional cardiac service. In this double-blind study, 13 patients were randomized to receive captopril, 12 patients enalapril and 11 patients placebo for 12 months. In patients receiving placebo, acute myocardial infarction was associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems and stimulation of natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide levels in the plasma of the brain. ACE inhibition did not significantly alter circulating levels of norepinephrine, brain natriuretic peptide, or atrial natriuretic peptide. Compared to placebo, enalapril induced a precipitous fall in plasma ACE activity and plasma angiotensin II levels were reduced by both ACE inhibitors. Using pooled data, circulating brain natriuretic peptide concentrations at the time of zero sampling were significantly higher than atrial natriuretic peptide values. The natriuretic peptide levels in the brain after 72 h correlated significantly with the left ventricular ejection fraction of the radionuclide measured 5 days and 3 months after the infarction. Similar associations were observed for atrial natriuretic peptide and norepinephrine. We confirm activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems after acute myocardial infarction. The responses of atrial natriuretic peptide and brain and sympathetic nervous system natriuretic peptide to acute myocardial infarction were not significantly altered by ACE inhibition. Concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide correlated significantly with left ventricular ejection fraction measured 5 days and again 3 months after myocardial infarction and may prove to be a useful prognostic index.",0,0
1330,7588925,Contractile status is the most important determinant of functional outcome in patients with left ventricular dysfunction treated with enalapril.,,"Mirsky, I; Aoyagi, T; Ihara, T; van Eyll, C; Rousseau, M F; Pouleur, H","Large-scale drug studies have focused mainly on mortality and morbidity and less on myocardial function. A model was developed to assess the contractile state of the myocardium in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and to address the question of functional differences between patients with and without overt heart failure, the effects of enalapril and the best predictors of functional outcome respond. Pressure angiographic data were obtained from 16 patients with apparent heart failure and 47 without heart failure. Repeat studies were performed in 41 patients after 1 year of treatment with enalapril or placebo. Left ventricular silhouettes were divided into 18 segments to estimate regional ejection fraction, wall tension, and myocardial damage (% myocardial damage). Contractile status was assessed and graded by the relationship between ejection rate, preload, and afterload and by a score method based on 10 myocardial and ventricular function parameters. End-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (EDV, ESV) were significantly greater (P < 0.001), ejection fraction (EF) lower (P < 0.009), percent myocardial damage greater (P < 0.008), and contractile status lower in patients with more obvious heart failure. The changes in EDV and ESV (delta placebo vs. delta enalapril) were significant (delta EDV, P<0.003; delta ESV, P<0.014). Directional shifts in diastolic pressure-volume relationships with enalapril or placebo depended mainly on basal contraction state and diastolic volume range. The best single predictors of post-treatment EF were score index (a surrogate parameter of contractile state) and ESV. Additional benefits of enalapril include preventing further dilatation in patients with less depressed contractile states and delaying the onset of heart failure. Asymptomatic patients with LV dysfunction should also be considered for therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.",0,0

All patients received placebo for 2 weeks followed by an 8-week double-blind period and were randomized to receive either diltiazem (n=50) or captopril (n=50). Her blood pressure was measured at trough levels at week 4 immediately prior to dosing, ie 24 hours after the diltiazem dose or 12 hours after the captopril dose. Also at week 4, in non-responders, diltiazem was increased from 200 to 300 mg once daily and captopril from 12.5 to 25 mg twice daily to achieve a target reduction in supine diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure below 90 reach mmHg. Supine diastolic blood pressure was significantly (p<0.001) reduced at week 8 from 102 +/- 1 to 90 +/- 1 mmHg with diltiazem and from 103 +/- 1 to 89 +/- 1 mmHg with captopril, reflecting the This parameter yielded results within normal limits for both groups.

Blood pressure, foot volume, and plasma norepinephrine concentration were measured at the end of each run-in and treatment period.; The combination of alpha-blockade and calcium antagonism caused a fall in blood pressure in the supine and standing positions. These falls were significantly greater than with either drug alone and greater than the sum of falls with each drug. The combination of amlodipine and the ACE inhibitor was also additive. Both combinations with amlodipine were well tolerated by all patients.; The combination of alpha-blockade and calcium antagonism has not been studied and should be useful for resistant hypertensive patients who have not tolerated beta-blockade or ACE inhibitors.

With specific reference to treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Sigurdsson, A","Neurohormonal activation may represent a pathophysiological link between acute myocardial infarction and chronic congestive heart failure, and modulation of neurohormonal activity may be an important therapeutic target in these conditions. Plasma neurohormones were studied in 55 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Angiotensin II, norepinephrine, and ANP were elevated in the early phase but tended to normalize during the first week in patients with no evidence of heart failure. In heart failure patients, angiotensin II and norepinephrine remained elevated for 1 month and ANP for 4-6 months. During head-up tilt, angiotensin II and norepinephrine increased most in patients with heart failure. In patients with a first myocardial infarction, there was a positive correlation between sustained neurohormonal activity and infarct size. Almost complete suppression of plasma ACE activity was achieved within 30 minutes in 48 patients treated with intravenous enalaprilat starting within 24 hours of the onset of infarction. The drug was tolerated at doses of 1.0-1.2 mg administered over 1-2 h. Patients with a systolic blood pressure between 100 and 110 mmHg were at greater risk of hypotension than those with a higher baseline blood pressure. Tolerability was no worse in patients treated with intravenous diuretics, metoprolol, or nitroglycerin. A total of 98 patients were randomized to treatment with enalapril or placebo, started within 24 hours of onset of infarction and continued for 4-6 months. There were no significant differences in plasma levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone, ANP or catecholamines between the groups during treatment. Echocardiographic recordings were made in 28 patients. In patients on placebo, there was a positive correlation between plasma levels of norepinephrine on days 5–7 and the increase in left ventricular volume during the study period, and an inverse correlation between plasma aldosterone on days 5–7 and the increase in left ventricular ejection fraction during the study . No such correlation was found in patients receiving enalapril. Simultaneously, ANP levels at 1 month were inversely correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction. Plasma neurohormones were measured in 223 patients with mild or moderate chronic heart failure who were randomized to receive ramipril or placebo for three months. There were big swings in hormone levels. Norepinephrine and aldosterone were inversely correlated with exercise duration at baseline. Norepinephrine correlated positively with the degree of symptoms. Aldosterone and ANP were reduced with ramipril compared to placebo. Norepinephrine was reduced in patients with baseline values in the highest tertile. In 54 patients, the plasma hormones were also measured at maximum exercise. Resting hormone levels correlated strongly with those at maximum exertion. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0,0

1338,7601014,spirapril. A preliminary review of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of hypertension.,,"Noble, S; Sorkin, E M","Spirapril is a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prodrug that is converted to the active metabolite spiprilat after oral administration and has been primarily studied for the treatment of hypertension. In dose-ranging studies in patients with mild to severe hypertension, Spirapril > or = 6 mg once daily reduced blood pressure by approximately 10 to 18 mm Hg (systolic) and 7 to 13 mm Hg (diastolic) [24-hour post-dose nadirs at the end of the treatment period] . At the end of these studies, normal blood pressure (dry diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) had occurred in 29 to 50% of the patients. The dose-response curve for spirapril appears to be flat at doses ranging from 6 to 24 mg once daily. Comparisons with other ACE inhibitors are limited and more studies are needed before the relative antihypertensive efficacy of spirapril can be fully assessed. However, in individual, well-controlled clinical trials, spirapril resulted in blood pressure reductions similar to those of enalapril or captopril. Spirapril may offer potential advantages over the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine when given as monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Spirapril is generally well tolerated and produces an adverse event profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Data from small studies suggest that spirapril can be used in patients with renal impairment without dose adjustment as it has a dual renal and hepatic clearance mechanism. This is in contrast to most ACE inhibitors, which are primarily excreted by the kidneys, leading to accumulation of the active metabolite in renal impairment. However, the benefit of spirapril in this patient population has yet to be fully established due to conflicting data regarding its effects on renal function. Thus, spirapril is an effective antihypertensive drug that is well tolerated. Further comparative studies are needed to fully determine its effectiveness relative to other ACE inhibitors, and a better understanding of its effects on kidney function will clarify its role in hypertensive patients with kidney failure.",0,0
1339,7607715,Different mechanisms of action of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in black and white hypertensive patients. The trandolapril multicenter study group.,,"Weir, M R; Gray, J M; Paster, R; Saunders, E","The antihypertensive effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril administered at doses of 1, 2 and 4 mg/day was compared in 207 white patients and 91 black patients with mild to moderate hypertension in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, parallel study design. Trandolapril is a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed to its active diacid metabolite, trandolaprilate. After 6 weeks of double-blind treatment, trandolapril reduced baseline seated diastolic pressure in both white and black patients. A comparison of the antihypertensive responses between the two populations showed that black patients required two to four times the dose of trandolapril to achieve a similar response to white patients. A dose of trandolapril 1 mg/day in white subjects resulted in a mean decrease in baseline seated diastolic pressure of 6.1 mmHg; a similar response (-6.5 mm Hg) was observed in black patients at 4 mg/day. In contrast to the population differences in blood pressure, the decrease in angiotensin converting enzyme activity was similar for both populations. An assessment of trandolaprilat levels revealed that there were no racial differences in the concentrations of trandolaprilat required to achieve a given level of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Therefore, it appears that the antihypertensive response in black patients cannot be fully explained by a reduction in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. A lack of response at a lower dose but an increasing response at a higher dose may reflect a different vasodepressor activity of trandolapril or simply indicate a reduced sensitivity of hypertension in black people to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition .",0,0

1342,7608448,Comparison of the effects of losartan and enalapril on clinical status and exercise performance in patients with moderate or severe chronic heart failure.,,"Dickstein, K; Chang, P; Willenheimer, R; HaunsÃ¸, S; Remes, J; Hall, C; Kjekshus, J","This study evaluated the feasibility of an efficacy study comparing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor antagonism in heart failure. Patients with moderate or severe heart failure previously stabilized by treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor were randomized to receive enalapril or losartan. The study was designed to detect any signs of clinical deterioration during double-blind treatment.; Losartan is a specific non-peptide angiotensin II receptor 1 antagonist with a vasodilator hemodynamic profile similar to that of converting enzyme inhibitors. Although specific receptor blockade therapy has certain theoretical advantages over non-specific converting enzyme inhibition, demonstrating a comparable therapeutic effect in patients with congestive heart failure will require a great deal of effort by comparing two drugs.; One hundred and sixty-six patients with stable heart failure in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV and an ejection fraction < or = 35% were enrolled in a multicenter, double-blind, parallel, enalapril-controlled study. After a 3-week stabilization period with optimal therapy including digitalis, diuretics, and a converting enzyme inhibitor, patients were randomized to 8-week therapy with losartan, 25 mg/day (n=52); losartan, 50 mg/day (n=56); or enalapril, 20 mg/day (n=58). Patients were assessed with frequent clinical and laboratory examinations and stress tests.; There were no significant differences between groups in terms of changes in exercise capacity (6-minute walk test), clinical status (dyspnea fatigue index), neurohumoral activation (norepinephrine, N-terminal atrial natriuretic factor), laboratory score, or occurrence of side effects observed.; The results suggest that losartan and enalapril are of comparable efficacy and tolerability in the short-term treatment of moderate to severe congestive heart failure. A study comparing the efficacy, tolerability, and impact on mortality of long-term angiotensin II receptor blockade versus converting enzyme inhibition is both feasible and ethical.",1,0
1343,7611276,Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme in diabetic nephropathy: ten years of experience.,,"Parving, H H; Rossing, P; Hommel, E; Smidt, U M","The aim of our prospective study was to assess putative promoters of progression, renal function, and prognosis during long-term treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients with diabetic nephropathy. Eighteen consecutive hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients with nephropathy (mean age 33 years) who had not been previously treated were all treated with captopril in combination with frusemide or bendrofluazide. The four patients who did not respond to this regimen also received nifedipine. Treatment continued for a median of 8.9 years (range 6.3 to 9.8 years). Renal function was assessed every 6 months by measuring glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (single bolus 51Cr-EDTA technique) and albuminuria by radioimmunoassay. Baseline values (+/- SE) were mean arterial blood pressure 146/93 +/- 3/1 mmHg, albuminuria (geometric mean +/- antilog SE) 982 +/- 1.2 micrograms/min and GFR 98 +/- 5 ml /min/1.73m2. Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme resulted in significant reductions in blood pressure (137/85 +/- 3/1 mm Hg; P<0.01) and albuminuria (392 +/- 1.4 microns) throughout the treatment period /min; P<0.01) and the rate of decline in GFR was 4.4 +/- 0.7 mL/min/year, in contrast to previous reports of 10 to 14 mL/min/year (natural history). Univariate analysis revealed a significant correlation between the rate of decrease in GFR and mean arterial blood pressure (r = 0.58, P = 0.01), albuminuria (r = 0.67, P < 0.01), hemoglobin A1c (r = 0.69, P<0.01) , and total serum cholesterol concentration (r = 0.51, P<0.05).",1,0

All patients underwent a classic exercise test (ET) on a cycloergometer. The ET was repeated 24 hours later, 6 hours after the administration of 2 mg perindopril (Coversyl). No statistically significant differences in the duration and intensity of ET before and after perindopril were found for the whole group. But at least one level of exertion was achieved in 9 patients (42.8%). In these patients, peak double product (DP) was similar before and after perindopril, but at submaximal exertion, post-perindopril DP was lower at any level, suggesting a mechanism of afterload reduction in the improvement in exercise capacity.",0,0
1345,7614527,A comparison of captopril and digoxin in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure.,,"Heck, I; LÃ¼deritz, B; MÃ¼ller, H M; Esser, H","In a double-blind study, 116 patients (mean age 57.6 years) with mild to moderate chronic congestive heart failure and in sinus rhythm were randomized to receive captopril 25 mg twice daily (up to 50 mg twice daily if needed) plus hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ) (Group 1) or digoxin 0.1 mg twice daily plus HCTZ (Group 2) for 12 months. During a 3- to 4-week stabilization period prior to treatment, Group 1 received an average of 37.7 mg HCTZ daily and Group 2 34.9 mg daily. After 6 weeks and 12 months of treatment, improvement in five measures of cardiac function was noted in both treatment groups: exercise tolerance, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), ejection fraction, blood pressure, and heart rate. At 12 months, Group 1 experienced a significantly greater improvement in exercise tolerance than Group 2 (from 329 seconds at baseline to 445 seconds at 12 months in Group 1 and from 353 to 427 seconds in Group 2; P<0.05); LVEDD (from 60.5 to 56.5 mm in group 1 and from 60.3 to 57.9 mm in group 2; P<0.05); and blood pressure (from 103.5 to 95.6 mm Hg in group 1 and from 101.9 to 97.0 mm Hg in group 2; P<0.03). Clinical severity (New York Heart Association class) improved in both groups; 52% of patients in group 1 and 41% in group 2 fell one functional class on average (p<0.01). The results indicate that captopril in combination with a diuretic is an effective first-line treatment for patients with mild to moderate congestive heart failure.",1,0

Renal biopsies taken in 5 cases showed focal glomerulosclerosis in 2 cases, minimal changes in 2 and mesangial proliferation in 1. Nine patients (group 1) were on a hypocaloric diet; Significantly reduced body weight (BMI 37.1 +/- 3, 34 +/- 3.5 and 32.6 +/- 3.2 after 0, 6 and 12 months) and proteinuria (2.9 +/- 1, 7, 1.2 +/- 1 µ 0.4 +/- 0.6 g/24 h). There was a significant correlation between body weight loss and decrease in proteinuria (r = 0.69, p < 0.05). Eight patients (group 2) were treated with captopril without any change in diet. BMI remained stable, but proteinuria showed a dramatic decrease, similar to Group 1 (3.4 +/- 1.7, 1.2 +/- 0.9, and 0.7 +/- 1 g/24, respectively H). Renal function remained stable in both groups.

1349,7618614,Neurohumoral measurements as indicators of long-term prognosis after acute myocardial infarction.,,"Omland, T; Bonarjee, V V; Lie, R T; Caidahl, K","The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic accuracy and usefulness of neurohumoral assessment as a risk stratification tool after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by comparing the long-term prognostic value of subacute neurohumoral measurements with other established indicators of adverse outcomes. The study included 145 patients with documented AMI. During a median follow-up of 3.7 years, 30 cardiovascular and 6 non-cardiovascular deaths occurred. In a univariate analysis, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and plasma endothelin levels were closely associated with long-term cardiovascular mortality. In multivariate models, both peptides added to the prognostic information obtained from clinical assessment but not to that obtained from left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Estimation of the area under the receiver operating curve showed comparable prognostic accuracy for LVEF (0.7788), plasma ANF (0.7795), plasma endothelin (0.7493), and Killip classification (0.8203), which means that for all of these prognostic indicators, a randomly selected patient from the dying patient group will have a test value greater than that of a randomly selected patient from the surviving patient group 75% to 82% of the time. The clinical utility of neurohumoral assessment in routine risk stratification after AMI appears to be limited, as no additional prognostic information is obtained to that obtained by objective assessment of LV systolic function. In patients for whom an objective assessment of LV performance is not readily available, measurement of plasma ANF and endothelin can be helpful in identifying asymptomatic patients at risk for cardiac death.",0,0

The effect of changing the enalapril dose on the subjective cough and the cough response to inhaled capsaicin in nine hypertensive patients with enalapril-induced cough was evaluated in a randomized, single-blind, balanced, cross-over study. They received three doses of enalapril, each for 3 weeks; the initial dose (on average 10 mg daily); double this dose (average 20 mg daily); and half that dose (average 5 mg daily). 2. Cough response to inhaled capsaicin was also measured in two control groups: hypertensive patients on long-term treatment with enalapril without cough (n=18) and hypertensive patients taking nifedipine (n=17). 3. In patients with enalapril-induced cough, there were significant dose-response relationships for enalapril in terms of cough severity (P<0.05) and nocturnal cough awakenings (P<0.05), but not in Regarding the frequency of coughing. Although the cough was less severe (p<0.02) and caused fewer nocturnal awakenings (p<0.03) at the lowest dose of enalapril (average 5 mg daily), it did not completely disappear in any patient. 4. Sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin was not significantly different for the three enalapril doses. The relative potency of capsaicin on enalapril 20 mg compared to enalapril 5 mg was 1.0 (95% CI 0.4-2.2). The wide confidence limits indicate that an important dose-dependent shift in capsaicin sensitivity cannot be ruled out. 5.

1354,7624954,Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in the treatment of renal transplant erythrocytosis. Clinical experience and observation of the mechanism.,,"Danovitch, G M; Jamgotchian, N J; Eggena, P H; Paul, W; Barrett, J D; Wilkinson, A; Lee, D B","Recent observations indicate that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition corrects renal transplant erythrocytosis (RTE). The mechanism for this association is not known. We examined the effect of ACE inhibition on hematocrit, erythropoietin (EPO) and renin substrate. ACE inhibition has been reported to suppress the renin substrate, which is known to stimulate EPO and erythropoiesis. In 15 patients with RTE, the hematocrit fell from 52.8 +/- 0.6 (SEM) to 45.8 +/- 1.4% after 8 weeks of treatment with enalapril, 2.5-20 mg/day. Serum EPO (normal range: 9-30 mU/ml) was high in one patient, normal in seven and low in seven patients. ACE inhibition reduced EPO in patients with initially high or normal levels but did not induce a change in patients with initially low levels. ACE inhibition had no significant effect on the renin substrate. In one patient who refused his first transplant, erythrocytosis recurred after a second, successful transplant. Treatment was discontinued in two patients because of cough and in one patient because of symptomatic hypotension. We conclude that RTE is not caused by hypererythropoietinemia. In patients with normally circulating EPO, erythrocytosis can result from increased sensitivity to EPO, and ACE inhibition lowered hematocrit by further reducing this hormone. However, the finding of erythrocytosis in half of our patients with suppressed EPO suggests the involvement of non-EPO-mediated mechanisms. The recurrence of RTE in a patient after a second transplant raises the additional possibility of patient-specific factors in the pathogenesis of this disease. Contrary to other reports, we documented side effects (cough, hypotension) in three (20%) of our patients. Our clinical experience, coupled with previous reports of spontaneous resolution of RTE in some patients, suggests that intermittent cycles of ACE inhibition may be the optimal strategy when using this form of therapy for RTE.",0,0

As a result of this global effort, involving hundreds of thousands of myocardial infarction patients, data has accumulated showing substantially reduced mortality from acute myocardial infarction with simple interventions such as IV thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Emergency coronary angioplasty appears to be a suitable alternative to IV thrombolytic therapy in qualified centers. Several previously recommended therapies (lidocaine routinely IV, calcium channel blockers, magnesium, nitrates) have not proven life-saving. Whether routine coronary arteriography should be used after myocardial infarction remains controversial, but it is generally accepted that patients with evidence of residual ischemia after infarction, either spontaneously or through stress testing, should undergo prophylactic coronary artery revascularization.",0,0

1363,7641605,Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Clinical manifestations and instructions for treatment.,,"Rees, J","Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is now the most common cause of acute neuromuscular paralysis in industrialized countries. Patients most commonly present with rapidly ascending paralysis along with sensory symptoms and variable autonomic involvement. Diagnosis is clinical, but spinal tap and nerve conduction studies are helpful to rule out other disorders. The improvement in prognosis in recent years is largely due to advances in respiratory critical care management. Careful monitoring of cardiorespiratory function, and especially regular measurements of vital capacity, helps predict which patients will need elective ventilation to prevent impending neuromuscular respiratory failure. The paralyzed patient is prone to all complications of immobility, especially venous thromboembolism and hypostatic pneumonia, making good care and physical therapy imperative. Autonomic involvement may predispose to cardiac arrhythmia and labile blood pressure. The duration of the illness predisposes to psychiatric complications, particularly depression, and these should be managed appropriately. Specific treatment aims to shorten the duration of maximum disability. Both plasma exchange (PE) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) have been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials. A multi-centre study is ongoing to determine whether PE or IVIg or PE followed by IVIg is the most effective treatment for this condition. Steroids alone have not proven useful, although a study is ongoing comparing the combination of IVIg and methylprednisolone to IVIg alone. The prognosis of GBS is generally good, with about 80% of patients making a full recovery, although about 5% die from complications.",0,0

Whether this initial phenomenon is reversible (hemodynamic) or irreversible (structural damage) after prolonged AHT is not known. To elucidate these mechanisms, we studied 42 hypertensive IDDM patients (16F/26M, age 40 +/- 7 years, mean +/- SD) with DN who had AHT (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, N = 30) for 6 (2 to 15) received. years [median (range)]. GFR (ml/min/1.73 m2), arterial blood pressure (BP, mm Hg) and albuminuria (mg/24 h) were measured on the last day of AHT and one month after AHT was discontinued. The variables measured were all significantly increased after stopping AHT: GFR [mean (SEM)] from 76(4) to 81(4) (P<0.0001), BP [mean (SEM)] from 140/82 (2nd /1) to 151/89 (2/1) (p<0.0005) and albuminuria [geometric mean (antilog SEM)] from 704 (1.2) to 1122 (1.2) (p<0.0001) . A correlation was found between the relative increase in systolic blood pressure (Delta Sys%) and the relative change in GFR (Delta GFR%) (r = 0.44, P < 0.005). Our results somewhat support the hypothesis that the faster initial decline in GFR is due to a functional (hemodynamic) effect of AHT that does not diminish over time, while the subsequent slower decline reflects the beneficial effect on diabetic progression reflecting nephropathy.",0,0

Mean values decreased slightly from 20 +/- 11 mU/mL at baseline to 12 +/- 5 mU/mL at 6 months, a change that was not statistically significant. The mean levels at each time point were not statistically different from the mean value before treatment. In addition, there was no correlation between mean circulating erythropoietin levels and mean hematocrit (r = 0.43, P = 0.20) or hemoglobin concentration (r = 0.36, P = 0.30) during therapy with enalapril between changes of these parameters 250 WORDS)",0,0
1366,7648653,Impact of infarct artery patency on prognosis after acute myocardial infarction. The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement Researchers.,,"Lamas, G A; Flaker, G C; Mitchell, G; Smith, S C; Gersh, B J; Wun, C C; MoyÃ©, L; Rouleau, J L; Rutherford, J D; Pfeffer, M A","In patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), early restoration of infarct-related artery (IRA) patency leads to preservation of left ventricular function and improved clinical outcome. However, there is evidence that the benefits associated with an open IRA are disproportionate to the observed improvement in ventricular function and may result not only from salvaging the ischemic myocardium, but also from opening the IRA over a narrow time window after the infarction . The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the effect of IRA patency on the outcome of patients post acute MI with left ventricular dysfunction controlling for differences in left ventricular ejection fraction and extent of coronary artery disease, and (2) to determine the effect of therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with open and occluded infarct arteries.; The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study consisted of 2231 patients with a documented MI and left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%. They were randomized to receive ACE inhibitor captopril (50 mg tid) or placebo 3 to 16 days after MI and followed for a mean of 3.5 years. Left ventricular ejection fraction, measured by radionuclide left ventriculography, was repeated at the end of the follow-up period. This study is based on the 946 patients who were assessed to have IRA patency prior to randomization. In a cardiac catheter examination an average of 4.2 days after the infarction, 30.7% of the patients had an initially occluded IRA. After revascularization, 162 of the 946 patients (17.1%) had a closed IRA at the time of randomization. The 162 patients with persistently occluded IRAs and 784 with persistent IRAs had similar baseline clinical characteristics, but those with occluded arteries had a slightly lower ejection fraction than the 784 patients with persistent infarcted arteries (30% versus 32%, P=0.01). Cox proportional hazards analyzes showed that the independent predictors of all-cause mortality were hypertension (risk ratio [RR] 1.94, P<0.001), number of diseased coronary arteries (RR 1.68, P<0.001), occluded IRA (RR 1.49, P=0.039), ejection fraction (RR 1.36, P<0.001), age (RR 1.10, P=0.030), and use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (RR 0.60, P=0.007). Independent predictors of a composite endpoint consisting of cardiovascular mortality, morbidity, or reduction in ejection fraction of > or = 9 units were occluded IRA (odds ratio [OR] 1.73, P = 0.002), hypertension (OR 1.71, P < 0.002). 001), number of diseased vessels (OR 1.38, P<0.001), ejection fraction (OR 1.18, P=0.003), use of beta-blockers (OR 0.67, P=0.007), and randomization to captopril (OR 0 .70, P=0.009); IRA patency within 16 days of MI predicts a favorable clinical outcome regardless of the number of occluded coronary arteries or left ventricular function. The beneficial effect of ACE inhibition is independent of the IRA's patent status. These results support the need for additional, prospective clinical trials of late reperfusion in MI patients.",0,0

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover study in outpatients. Four phases were performed: 2 weeks of placebo, 8 weeks of maintenance therapy (perindopril or amlodipine) and 2 weeks of washout between treatment periods. Ten hypertensive patients with stable renal allograft function, transplanted more than 6 months previously and receiving ciclosporin as part of their immunosuppressive regimen were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to perindopril (2 or 4 mg/d) and amlodipine (5 mg/d). In practice, if the diastolic pressure was greater than or equal to 90 mmHg after 4 weeks, the dose was doubled and continued for another 4 weeks. The key outcome measures were changes in office and ambulatory blood pressure over 24 hours after 8 weeks of active treatment, and the effect of treatment and time on glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow. Perindopril and amlodipine were equally effective in lowering real-world blood pressure and similarly effective over the 24-hour period of the day. Neither drug affected glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow. Both agents demonstrated an equivalent capacity (time x treatment, P=0.955) to reverse renal vascular resistance (amlodipine from 0.35 +/- 0.02 to 0.30 +/- 0.02 mm Hg/mL per minute per 1.73 m2; perindopril from 0.36 +/- 0.03 to 0.32 +/- 0.01) (time effect of all treatments combined, P=0.043).

Short-term studies have been conducted during cardiac catheterization in young normotensive subjects (mean age 33 years; range 19 to 40) and several different age groups (range 25 to 53 years) of patients with essential hypertension. Aortic impedance, resistance, wave reflections, and compliance were calculated from high-fidelity recordings of ascending aortic pressure and flow signals during baseline and after nitroprusside, propranolol, followed by phentolamine, phentolamine, captopril, and nifedipine, respectively, at doses sufficient to permeate the blood normalize pressure in each hypertensive group. Propranolol worsened all hemodynamic parameters; these effects were only partially overcome by phentolamine. Among the other drugs, only phentolamine did not completely normalize compliance, and only captopril did not completely normalize wave reflections. The long-term study was a randomized, double-blind comparison of fosinopril and atenolol in 79 subjects with normal blood pressure and 79 subjects with essential hypertension. All subjects and hypertensive patients after 8 weeks of therapy had 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure readings and carotid tonometry for index wave reflection. Both fosinopril and atenolol normalized blood pressure and reduced elevated augmentation index, but fosinopril had a significantly greater effect than atenolol. Both short- and long-term beta-blockade did not have as positive an effect as the other drugs. Therefore, the different hemodynamic effects of the different classes of antihypertensive drugs could be taken into account in the choice of therapy.",0,0

Of 410 men who failed initial treatment, 352 qualified for randomization to the alternative drug.; Of the 352 patients, 173 (49.1%) achieved their diastolic blood pressure goal, 133 (37.8%) failed the alternative medications, and 46 (13.1%) withdrew from the study for various reasons. The overall response rates were as follows: diltiazem, 63%; clonidine, 59%; prazosin, 47%; hydrochlorothiazide, 46%; atenolol, 41%; and captopril, 37%. The best response rate in patients who failed hydrochlorothiazide was with diltiazem (70%); after atenolol failure clonidine (86%); after captopril failure prazosin (54%); after clonidine failure diltiazem (100%); after failure of diltiazem captopril (67%); and after prazosin failure clonidine (53%). The combined response rate for patients originally randomized to active treatment was 76.0%, consistent with that achieved with the combination of two drugs in previous studies.; We conclude that sequential monotherapy is a rational approach to treating hypertension in patients who have failed initial drug therapy.",0,0

Collaborative Group for ACE Inhibitor Studies.,,"Garg, R; Yusuf, S","To evaluate the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on mortality and morbidity in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.; Data were obtained for all completed, published or unpublished, randomized, placebo-controlled studies of at least 8 weeks duration with ACE inhibitors that determined all-cause mortality from treatment intent, regardless of sample size. Studies were identified based on literature reviews and correspondence with investigators and pharmaceutical companies.; Using standard tables, data were extracted by one author and, where appropriate, corroborated by the other author or the study's principal investigator. Unpublished data were obtained through direct correspondence with the principal investigator of each study or pharmaceutical company.; Data for each endpoint were combined using the Yusuf-Peto adaptation of the Mantel-Haenszel method. Overall, there was a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67 to 0.88; P<0.001) and the composite endpoint of mortality or hospitalization for congestive heart failure ( OR, 0.65, 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.74, p<0.001). Similar benefits have been observed with several different ACE inhibitors, although the data have been largely based on enalapril maleate, captopril, ramipril, quinapril hydrochloride and lisinopril. Reductions in all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint were similar for different subgroups studied (age, gender, etiology, and New York Heart Association class). However, patients with the lowest ejection fraction appeared to have the greatest benefit. The greatest effect was seen during the first 3 months, but additional benefit was seen during continued treatment. The reduction in mortality was mainly due to fewer deaths from progressive heart failure (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.83); Point estimates for effects on sudden or suspected arrhythmic death (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.12) and fatal myocardial infarction (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.11) were less than 1 but not significant.; All-cause mortality and hospitalizations for congestive heart failure are significantly reduced by ACE inhibitors with consistent effects in a wide range of patients.",1,1

In a population-based case-control study involving 440 renal cell cancer cases, spouses of an additional 151 cases, and 691 controls, we assessed the risk of renal cell cancer associated with hypertension and the use of diuretics and other antihypertensive drugs. The risks increased with the use of diuretics or other antihypertensive drugs, particularly in people who had no history of high blood pressure. After adjustment for hypertension, use of diuretics alone was associated with a 40% greater risk (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 0.8-2.2), while use of other antihypertensive drugs was associated with a 2-fold risk was (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.2-3.3). Risk of excess was not restricted to specific products, and no trend in estimated lifetime consumption of a product was observed. In addition, the risk was not potentiated by the presence of hypertension and the use of antihypertensive drugs. In people not taking antihypertensive drugs, a history of high blood pressure was associated with a 40-50% increased risk of renal cell cancer. Excluding subjects with hypertension diagnosed within 5 years of cancer diagnosis or interview had little impact on risk. These results suggest a small effect on renal cell cancer risk associated with hypertensive disorders and with the use of diuretics and other antihypertensive drugs, but distinguishing individual effects is difficult due to possible misclassification of highly correlated events.",0,0

Dosing was increased when mean sitting diastolic blood pressure was > 90 mmHg. Significantly greater mean reductions in systolic blood pressure were observed after 2, 6 and 8 weeks of isradipine. However, at the end of the study, 83% of patients receiving isradipine and 78% of patients receiving enalapril had a reduction in sitting diastolic blood pressure of at least 5 mm Hg to a value below 96 mm Hg.

There was a trend towards a lower frequency of adverse reactions in patients who were unresponsive to isradipine (25%) and a higher frequency in patients who were unresponsive to enalapril (43%). Pruritus, dizziness, edema and fatigue were reported more frequently with isradipine, and cough and changes in bowel habits were more frequently reported with enalapril.

In the current study, the authors examined the effect of two ACE inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and PAI in 33 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Blood samples were collected prior to treatment and then at weeks 1, 12, and 24 after initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy for measurement of tPA antigen and PAI activity levels. The results of the study showed that the initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy at the time points studied had no significant effect on tPA antigen or PAI activity and that no significant differences were demonstrated between captopril and enalapril. The results therefore suggest that ACE inhibitors do not affect tPA antigen or PAI activity in CHF patients, and thus another mechanism is likely responsible for the observed decrease in coronary artery thrombosis in post-MI patients co-treated with ACE - Inhibitors have been treated.",0,0

Thirty-nine untreated patients with essential hypertension and 28 controls with normal blood pressure were studied under baseline conditions. Hypertensive patients were randomized to three treatment groups: bisoprolol (10 mg/day, n=15), enalapril (20 mg/day, n=12), and verapamil SR (240 mg/day, n=12). examined before and after 1 month of treatment. Plasma catecholamines were determined by a radioenzymatic assay. Surface beta-2 adrenoceptors were measured in intact lymphocytes by a radioligand binding assay using the hydrophilic ligand [3H]-CGP12177. Beta-2-adrenoceptor density was increased in hypertensive patients (p<0.01). After treatment, mean blood pressure decreased similarly in the three groups, while plasma catecholamines did not show significant changes in any group. The number of beta-2-adrenoceptors decreased only in the patients treated with bisoprolol (p<0.05). The mean drop in blood pressure correlated with beta-2-adrenoceptor decrements only in the bisoprolol-treated patients (r=0.65, P<0.05). The density of beta-2-adrenoceptors correlated with plasma adrenaline levels in the control group (r = -0.50, p < 0.01) but not in hypertensive patients before treatment. This correlation was also observed in hypertensive patients treated with bisoprolol (r=-0.52, P<0.05), but not in patients treated with verapamil or enalapril.

One patient died in each treatment group. There were three dropouts in the placebo group (progressive heart failure requiring antitensin-converting enzyme inhibition) and one dropout in the enalapril group (ventricular malignant arrhythmias). Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and norepinephrine decreased similarly in both groups from elevated baseline concentrations. The patients with the highest baseline ANP levels died in both groups: EN: 579 fmol/mL (mean 65.3 +/- 34.4 fmol/mL), PL: 403 fmol/mL (mean 63.5 +/- - 37.6 fmol/ml). Killip classification improved in 9 out of 13 patients on enalapril but only in 5 out of 11 patients on placebo. Echocardiography showed an increase in fractional shortening (FS) only with enalapril (3.2 +/- 7.5%, p<0.05). Patients on placebo required more diuretics and plasma aldosterone increased three-fold. Therefore, very early treatment with enalapril can help prevent left ventricular failure after AMI. Extremely high initial plasma ANP concentrations can predict an unfavorable outcome.",0,0

Recently, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced anemia has been reported to occur in patients on chronic hemodialysis and in kidney transplant recipients. We report here on 5 transplant recipients whose hematocrit decreased while taking ACE inhibitors, including 2 patients treated with ACE inhibitors for erythrocytosis. The individual mean hematocrit values ranged from 35.0% to 54.7% before treatment and from 27.6% to 42.0% after treatment. The hematocrit value decreased in the 2 patients with erythrocytosis from 54.7% to 39.8% and from 47.5% to 27.6%. The anemia improved after discontinuation or dose reduction of the drugs. The patients received the same immunosuppressive drugs and had good kidney function. No ACE inhibitor-induced marked anemia was observed in either the transplant recipient, who received a kidney from a twin sibling and was not taking immunosuppressive drugs, nor in the 8 other patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic glomerulonephritis who served as controls. We conclude that ACE inhibitor-induced anemia can often occur in an immunocompromised state. Based on these events, the ACE inhibitor can be used as an effective drug for erythrocytosis in post-transplant recipients.",0,0

1385,7669262,ACE inhibitors. Drug interactions of clinical importance.,,"Mignat, C; Unger, T","ACE inhibitors are widely used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure, but there is limited information on adverse interactions between ACE inhibitors and other cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular drugs. This article provides an overview of this topic, focusing on the interactions that have the greatest clinical implications. In patients who are sodium and/or volume depleted by thiazides or loop diuretics, the addition of ACE inhibitors may result in excessive hypotension and symptomatic hypotension. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics and ACE inhibitors may increase serum potassium levels, leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency. The occurrence of acute renal failure may be associated with ACE inhibitor therapy when these drugs are combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and administered to patients whose renal function is becoming increasingly dependent on angiotensin II and prostaglandins. There is some, albeit sparse, evidence linking ACE inhibitors to the induction of lithium toxicity in patients treated with lithium and to the occurrence of severe hypersensitivity reactions in patients undergoing hemodialysis, toxic immunization or concomitant allopurinol therapy -Undergo therapy, connect.",0,0
1386,7669481,Effects of different antihypertensive drugs on plasma fibrinogen in patients with hypertension.,,"Fogari, R; Zoppi, A; Malamani, G D; Marasi, G; Vanasia, A; Villa, G","1. To assess whether treatment with different antihypertensive drugs would affect plasma fibrinogen levels, 118 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, all males aged 18 to 65 years, were randomized to receive amlodipine 10 mg, atenolol 100 mg and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide or lisinopril 20 mg, each once daily for 8 weeks. 2. Before and after 8 weeks of treatment, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), fibrinogen, total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides (TG), plasma glucose, plasma uric acid, serum creatinine and serum potassium were rated. 3. All four drugs significantly reduced blood pressure levels, although the blood pressure lowering effects of lisinopril, amlodipine and atenolol were significantly greater compared to hydrochlorothiazide. 4. Plasma fibrinogen levels were unaffected by atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine, while they were significantly reduced by lisinopril (-11.2%, P=0.002). This fibrinogen-lowering effect was more pronounced in smokers (-17.7%) than in non-smokers (-7.4%). 5. Atenolol and amlodipine did not significantly affect plasma lipids, hydrochlorothiazide increased TC, LDL-C and TG and decreased HDL-C; Lisinopril increased HDL-C and decreased TC and LDL-C. 6. Hydrochlorothiazide increased plasma glucose and uric acid concentrations unaffected by the other drugs. The diuretic also reduced serum potassium. 7. The results of this study indicate that lisinopril reduces plasma fibrinogen levels and confirm that different antihypertensive drugs can produce different metabolic effects that may affect the overall risk profile of hypertensive patients differently.",0,0

In 266 outpatients with mild essential hypertension (age: 18-78 years), CBP (trough values) and ABP (Spacelabs 90202 or 90207) were measured after 3 to 4 weeks of wash-out and after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment with an ACE. inhibitor (n = 135) or a calcium antagonist (n = 131). ABP recordings were analyzed to obtain mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values and standard deviations (BP variabilities) over 24 hours, during the day (6 a.m. to midnight) and at night (midnight to 6 a.m.). Treatment reduced both CBP and ABP. Treatment-induced changes in CBP showed poor correlation with those of 24-hour, day and night blood pressure (r never > 0.23), and the correlation was also poor when trough ABP (mean of last 2 hours) taken into consideration. 24 hour, day and night BP were similarly reduced by treatment with a direct relationship between initial BP values and subsequent BP drops. BP standard deviations were also reduced by treatment relative to pretreatment values, but the overall reduction was small, limited to time of day, and proportional or less than proportional to the reduction in mean values, with no changes or an increase in coefficients of variation. The effects of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonist treatments were superimposable. Our results from a large database show that antihypertensive treatment effectively reduces all ABP components. The reduction cannot be predicted by the simultaneous drop in CBP, but is related to the initial ABP values. Treatment has a limited effect on BP variability for both ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers.",0,0

However, restenosis remains the most significant limitation of angioplasty, occurring in 20-50% of patients after a successful procedure. Over the past 10 years, more than 40 large randomized pharmacology trials have attempted to address this issue. At present, no single agent has been clearly demonstrated to reduce restenosis. As a result of intensive research, an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of restenosis as well as the design of clinical trials needed to study the process has resulted. Recent experimental studies suggest that vascular remodeling may be as important as intimal hyperplasia, and future attempts need to address this aspect of the restenosis process. Current approaches to preventing restenosis include the use of combined drug therapy to target multiple pathophysiological processes, local delivery of a drug at the site of injury to maximize drug effect, and the use of highly specific drugs, including local gene therapy.",0,0

Of the 409 patients enrolled in the captopril study, 108 had proteinuria in the nephrotic range (>3.5 g/24 h) at study entry (baseline). This group was the subject of the present study. The remission of proteinuria in the nephrotic area was defined as follows: (1) The date on which a proteinuria of < or = 1.0 g/24 h was first detected was taken as the onset of remission.

This may help clarify the mechanism of action of pravastatin's rapid beneficial effects on cardiovascular morbidity. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, we treated 25 patients with hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia with either pravastatin or placebo for 12 weeks. Placebo treatment did not alter plasma lipids, while 12 weeks of pravastatin treatment reduced total cholesterol by 27% (from 7.1 +/- 0.27 to 5.2 +/- 0.18, p<0.001 compared to placebo) and reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 35%.

Thus, pravastatin remains effective as a lipid-lowering agent in the presence of antihypertensive therapy, but does not potentiate the antihypertensive effects of these drugs.

To investigate this issue, we examined the effects of a calcium channel blocker, nitrendipine (NIT, 10-20 mg bid), and a converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril (LIS, 10-20 mg od), on blood pressure (Bureau BP, 24 hr ambulatory blood pressure), clearance of acute sodium load (200 mmol/2 hr IV), glomerular filtration rate (insulin clearance), cumulative dopamine clearance, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) from plasma, and endothelin clearance in 8 patients with CAH after heart failure transplantation in a double-blind , randomized crossover study for 6 weeks. Five patients received a constant dose of a diuretic during the study. Office diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased significantly with LIS from 97 +/- 6 to 87 +/- 9 mmHg and with NIT from 96 +/- 7 to 92 +/- 12 mmHg. The 24-hour ambulatory DBP decreased significantly from 96 +/- 7 mmHg to 86 +/- 10 mmHg (LIS) and to 84 +/- 11 mmHg (NIT). Ambulatory DBP was significantly reduced from 98 +/- 11 mmHg to 87 +/- 10 mmHg (LIS) and to 88 +/- 9 mmHg (NIT) during the day and from 95 +/- 9 mmHg to 86+/- 8 at night mmHg (LIS) and to 79 +/- 7 mmHg (NIT). Cumulative sodium excretion 6 hours after an acute sodium load increased to 52 +/- 39 mmol (placebo), 96 +/- 44 mmol (LIS, P<0.05 vs. placebo) and 71 +/- 34 mmol (NIT). Glomerular filtration rate, cumulative dopamine excretion, ANP and endothelin excretion did not differ between both treatment groups. We conclude that: (1) both drugs were similar in reducing blood pressure in the office and during the day, but NIT tended to be more effective during the night; and (2) cumulative sodium excretion during LIS was significantly increased compared to placebo. There was also a similar trend during the NIT. Therefore, it is possible that chronic inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme and possibly calcium channel blockers improve sodium retention status in CAH, independent of differences in blood pressure, ANP, dopamine, or renal function.",0,0

However, the neurohumoral assessment is said to be more accurate. In 55 patients with moderate heart failure (ejection fraction < or = 35%), we evaluated the dose-dependent effects of ACE inhibition with oral quinapril (2.5, 5, or 10 mg twice daily) in a placebo-controlled parallel design protocol for 12 weeks. Plasma components of the renin-angiotensin system, catecholamines and ANF were measured together with hemodynamics both at rest and during exercise. Before treatment with ACE inhibitors, median PRA, Ang I and II, and catecholamines were normal, while ANF was elevated. All of these parameters, including ACE activity, increased during exercise. Chronic inhibition of ACE activity was dose-dependent, and the maximum decrease in Ang II occurred at quinapril 20 mg per day. Humoral changes seemed more evaluable than hemodynamic changes, although many of these changes were reasonably correlated. The effects of chronic ACE inhibition on circulating neurohumoral components in patients with moderate heart failure are small and dose-dependent. Since humoral changes are related to hemodynamics, they should account for clinical utility. Correspondingly high doses of ACE inhibitors should be selected for the treatment of heart failure.",0,0

In these studies, headache (14.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (6.5%), dizziness (14.1%), asthenia/fatigue (3.8%), and cough (3.1%) were the most common most commonly reported clinical side effects in patients treated with losartan. These side effects were also commonly reported in patients receiving placebo: 17.2%, 5.6%, 2.4%, 3.9% and 2.6%, respectively. Adverse reactions to dry cough were reported in 8.8% of patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and in 3.1% and 2.6% of patients treated with losartan and placebo, respectively. Only dizziness was considered “drug-related” more frequently in losartan-treated patients (2.4%) than in placebo-treated patients (1.3%). In controlled clinical trials, losartan was better tolerated than other antihypertensive drugs as determined by the incidence of patients reporting drug-related adverse events. Discontinuation rates due to clinical adverse events in patients receiving losartan monotherapy or losartan + hydrochlorothiazide were 2.3% and 2.8%, respectively, compared to placebo (3.7%). No adverse laboratory experiences were unexpected or of clinical significance. First-dose hypotension was rare with losartan or with losartan plus hydrochlorothiazide, and withdrawal symptoms such as rebound hypertension were not observed in clinical trials. There were no clinically meaningful differences in clinical or laboratory safety profiles across age, gender, or race demographic subgroups. Losartan showed an excellent tolerability profile in controlled clinical studies.",0,0

The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on beta-adrenoceptor density and Gi-alpha proteins in sequential endomyocardial biopsies. Nineteen patients with mild to moderate congestive heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (NYHA classes II-III) were studied before and after 8-11 weeks of therapy. The patients were randomized into a captopril and a control group; Nine patients received captopril 12.5-50 mg per day (divided into 2-3 doses) po in addition to ""conventional"" therapy with digoxin and diuretics, and 10 controls received only ""conventional"" therapy. Echocardiography, spirometry, right heart catheterization, and endomyocardial biopsies were performed before (baseline) and after treatment. Compared to baseline, captopril increased total beta-adrenoceptor density by selectively increasing beta-1-adrenoceptors (31.6 vs. 41.2 fmol.mg-1; p<0.05), but had no significant effect on Gi-alpha proteins. The results indicate that treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors partially restores myocardial beta-1-adrenoceptor density, and this effect may contribute to clinical improvement in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy treated in this way .",0,0

Subcutaneous small arteries obtained from gluteal fat biopsies were examined on a wire myograph before treatment and after 1 and 2 years of treatment. Blood pressure was slightly elevated in both patient groups (mean 150/100 mmHg) and well controlled (mean 130/85 mmHg) over 2 years of treatment. We previously reported an improvement in the vasoconstrictor effect of endothelin-1 in arteries of patients treated with cilazapril after 1 year of treatment, which was significantly attenuated in the untreated hypertensive patients compared to normotensive patients. After 2 years of treatment, this normalization of the endothelin-1 response was still present in the small arteries of patients treated with the angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitor, while in patients treated with atenolol, the response was still unchanged after 2 years of treatment. Endothelial function was tested by examining the response of norepinephrine-precontracted arteries to acetylcholine. Untreated hypertensive patients showed a slightly but significantly reduced vasorelaxation in response to 10 mumol/L acetylcholine compared to subjects of normal strength.

The current case-control study was conducted to investigate the possible role of drugs and other determinants in causing Guillain-Barré syndrome. Patients were included as cases if they met criteria for acute Guillain-Barré syndrome and were unable to walk 10 m independently and were hospitalized within 2 weeks of the onset of neuropathy. For each case, two controls without the disease were obtained from the general practitioner (GP) of the patient with Guillain-Barré syndrome. The controls had the same type of health insurance, were the same gender and age (within 5 years), and lived in the same area. The general practitioners of the patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome were interviewed by telephone. There were 71 female and 75 male cases and 142 female and 149 male controls. Significantly more cases than controls were prescribed drugs in the 3 months prior to the index date, and cases were more likely to have diagnoses or symptoms. Case patients used antipropulsive drugs (loperamide), penicillins (amoxicillin with or without clavulanic acid) and vaccines significantly more often. Female controls used oral contraceptives significantly more frequently. More cases than controls had respiratory, gastrointestinal, or urinary tract infections before the onset of neurological symptoms. In a logistic regression analysis, gastrointestinal and respiratory system symptoms were strongly associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. The use of oral contraceptives was significantly lower in women, which could be consistent with the hypothesis that these drugs are protective.",0,0

To determine whether the duration of inhibition of serum ACE activity can affect regional blood flow (RBF), we compared spirapril to captopril, a short-acting ACE inhibitor. Both the short- and long-term effects have been studied in patients with mild to moderate congestive heart failure (CHF). Calf, kidney, and liver BF measurements were taken in the morning before taking study medication; 24 h after the previous spirapril dose (n=9 patients) and 12 h after the previous captopril dose (n=9 patients). Serum ACE activity was significantly reduced after 1, 6 and 12 weeks in patients receiving spirapril but not in those receiving captopril. The decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) was more pronounced in the spirapril group. Calf BF showed a slight but not significant increase in both spirapril and captopril treated patients. Effective renal BF increased significantly only in patients treated with spirapril. Although the filtration fraction (FF) tended to decrease in the spirapril group, the decrease was significant only in the captopril group. No changes were observed in hepatic BF. Measurements of cerebral BF (CBF) were taken after ingestion of the first dose of study medication and at 12 weeks immediately post-medication. A significant reduction in MAP in the two treatment groups both after the first dose and at 12 weeks had no effect on CBF.

Twelve patients completed both parts of the study.; blood pressure, plasma converting enzyme activity; plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and norepinephrine; Excretion of metabolites of renal and systemic prostanoids.; The relieving effect of the first and second doses of enalapril in the morning lasted only during the day; in the extended study, it took 24 hours because of drug accumulation. Converting enzyme inhibitors dampen bradykinin degradation and therefore enhance bradykinin-mediated prostaglandin E2 synthesis. Evidence was found for such a prostaglandin E2-mediated contribution to ventricular unloading by enalapril blocked by salicylate. However, the contribution was small and variable, and the addition of salicylate had no significant relief effect during the day on average. Unloading was reversed in only three of the 20 patients in the short-term study and in one of the 12 in the extended study. At night, when other effects of enalapril on blood pressure had subsided and the bradykinin-induced effect persisted, salicylate significantly reduced the residual small relieving effect. No effect of addition of salicylate on remodeling reversal was observed. Enalapril reduced the angiotensin II-induced synthesis of systemic and renal prostaglandin I2 and thromboxane A2 initially only during the day, but later also at night. In doing so, it masked salicylate's suppression of thromboxane A2 synthesis, which is the effect attributed to salicylate's prevention of reinfarction; There is a small risk that salicylate will significantly reduce the benefits of enalapril in patients with heart failure by unloading the ventricle. As with other bradykinin-induced effects, significant relief occurs in only a minority of patients. However, in the presence of enalapril, salicylate is unlikely to be as effective as expected in reducing the risk of reinfarction, since enalapril is already effective in reducing thromboxane A2 synthesis in patients with heart failure and no further reduction by salicylate has been seen.",0,0

Venous compliance did not differ between the two borderline hypertensive groups and was only slightly lower than controls. Great artery compliance was assessed using a non-invasive ultrasonic vessel wall motion detector system, while venous compliance was determined using strain gauge plethysmography. The patients with borderline hypertension were then treated with enalapril 10 mg/day, felodipine 5 mg/day or placebo for six months. Despite similar reductions in blood pressure, enalapril induced a significant increase in muscular compliance in the femoral and brachial arteries but not in the elastic carotid artery, while felodipine did not affect great artery compliance at all in the sodium-sensitive group. The effect of enalapril on muscular artery compliance was demonstrated by a dose-dependent increase in distension and not by a change in artery diameter. Arterial compliance was not affected by any drug in the resistant group. The venous compliance was also not changed by the medication. In conclusion, femoral and brachial artery compliance in sodium-sensitive patients with borderline hypertension, which was less than in sodium-resistant patients, improved with antihypertensive treatment with enalapril but not with felodipine, despite the similar reduction in blood pressure, which was caused by both drugs.",0,0

However, it is unclear how effective reducing salt intake is compared to adding other drugs, particularly thiazide diuretics. In a double-blind, randomized, crossover study, we directly compared the separate effects of reducing sodium intake or adding a thiazide diuretic on blood pressure versus pressure of a converting enzyme inhibitor. We studied 11 subjects with essential hypertension who had been taking captopril 25 mg twice daily for at least 1 month. In the double-blind study, supine blood pressure after 1 month of captopril alone was 151 +/- 5/95 +/- 4 (SEM) mmHg. With the addition of 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once a day for 1 month, blood pressure fell to 137 +/- 5/87 +/- 3 mm Hg. If, in addition to captopril, a moderate reduction in salt intake (from 206 +/- 26 to 109 +/- 20 mmol urine sodium/24 h) was added, the blood pressure was increased by a similar amount (to 137 +/- 4 /90 +/- 3 mmHg).

Each drug was started at the minimum recommended dose or lower and increased every 2 weeks if well tolerated until blood pressure was controlled (diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg). When blood pressure was controlled, the drug was continued for another 2 weeks. A washout period of at least 2 weeks was allowed between drugs. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced with all six drugs. Eighteen of the 19 patients had blood pressure controlled with at least one of six drugs, often at the lowest dose.

We identified 94 patients admitted with hypoglycemia and selected 654 controls from the same cohort. Taking into account a variety of potential confounders, hypoglycemia was significantly associated with current ACE inhibitor use (odds ratio 2.8 [95% CI 1.4-5.7]). In both insulin and oral antidiabetic users, ACE inhibitor use was significantly associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for hypoglycaemia (2.8 [1.2–6.4] and 4.1 [1 .4–12.2]). Although ACE inhibitors have several advantages over other antihypertensive drugs in diabetes, the risk of hypoglycemia should be considered. Further investigation of the mechanism is needed as up to 13.8% of all hospitalizations for hypoglycaemia could be related to the use of ACE inhibitors.",0,0

The reproducibility of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough was evaluated in a double-blind, crossover study in patients previously shown to have this adverse reaction. 2. Ninety-seven patients with a history of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cough within the past 2 years were administered enalapril 20 mg daily for 4 weeks to assess eligibility. Cough symptoms recurred in 88 of 97 (91%) patients. 64 patients participated in the double-blind part of the study, in which they were randomly treated with enalapril 20 mg and a renin inhibitor for up to 4 weeks. These periods were separated by a minimum of 4-week placebo washout. 3. Of 59 evaluable patients who received enalapril a second time, 37 (62.7%) experienced cough recurrence. Of 62 patients treated with the renin inhibitor, 16 (25.8%) experienced cough, but since it did not have the same efficacy as enalapril, a valid comparison could not be made. 4. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cough is not reproducible in patients because other factors are involved in the etiology. Objective testing with blinded assessment along with symptom reporting would provide a more accurate measure of the incidence and mechanism of this adverse reaction.",0,0

Results of the SOLVD echocardiography substudy.,,"Greenberg, B; Quinones, M A; Koilpillai, C; Limacher, M; Shindler, D; Benedict, C; Shelton, B","Studies in left ventricular dysfunction (SOLVD) showed that therapy with enalapril significantly improved the clinical outcome of patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. The objectives of this substudy were to evaluate changes in LV structure and function in SOLVD patients and to test the hypothesis that enalapril inhibits remodeling in patients with LV dysfunction.; Patients from 5 of the 23 clinical centers who entered both the prevention and treatment arms of SOLVD were recruited for this substudy. The 301 participating patients underwent Doppler echocardiography prior to randomization to either enalapril or placebo and again after 4 and 12 months of therapy according to the standard protocol. The recorded data were analyzed in a central core laboratory in a blinded manner. Analysis of clinical characteristics at baseline indicated that patients enrolled in the substudy were generally representative of the SOLVD population, although patients in the prevention arm were slightly overrepresented in the substudy group (69.8% vs. 61.9 % of remaining SOLVD patients). The enalapril group showed a significant reduction in the mitral annular E-wave to A-wave velocity ratio (mainly due to a reduction in E-wave velocity), and this response differed from that in the placebo group (P=0.00 ). 030). Changes in the E to A ratio in the enalapril group correlated significantly with changes in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (r = 0.56; p < or = 0.01). LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes increased in patients treated with placebo but not enalapril, and differences in response between treatment groups were significant (p=0.025 and 0.019, respectively). LV mass tended to increase in placebo-treated patients and decreased in enalapril-treated patients, and the difference in response between groups was highly significant (P < or = 0.001); These data show that enalapril attenuates the progressive increase in LV dilatation and hypertrophy in patients with LV dysfunction. The results support the possibility that the beneficial effects of enalapril reported in the SOLVD studies are related to inhibition of LV remodeling.",0,0

The first study was conducted in 1984-1985; the second from 1988 to 1989; the pilot for the third in 1991; and the third from 1991 to 1994.; The total number of prescriptions for class I and III antiarrhythmics after acute myocardial infarction has halved over the past decade, from 11.9% at discharge and 14.4% at follow-up in 1984-85 to 5, 8% and 5.8% in 1991-1994, respectively. The trend was independent of the different distributions of patient characteristics in the three studies associated with antiarrhythmic drug use (ie, age > or = 70 years, anterior acute myocardial infarction , ventricular fibrillation during hospitalization, and Killip class > or = 2 at randomization). The same decreasing trend was observed for each antiarrhythmic drug. The most commonly used drug was amiodarone, which accounted for about half of antiarrhythmic prescriptions, followed by mexiletine hydrochloride and propafenone hydrochloride; Flecainide acetate was removed from the prescription list after the results of the arrhythmia suppression study were published.; The negative results of recent clinical trials on the use of class I antiarrhythmic drugs after acute myocardial infarction were quickly translated into routine clinical practice in Italy, since the proportion of patients receiving antiarrhythmic drugs of class I and III after acute myocardial infarction was halved in the early 1980s until the early 1990s.",0,0
1431,7751416,Dosing of antihypertensive drugs in patients with renal insufficiency.,,"Carter, B L","The use of antihypertensive drugs in patients with renal insufficiency requires careful dosing, titration and monitoring. Renal function must be estimated in order to appropriately adjust the dosing of antihypertensive drugs that have extensive renal elimination. Thiazide diuretics are useful in mild renal impairment, but loop diuretics become necessary if renal function continues to deteriorate. For both classes, low doses should be used to prevent hypovolaemia, hyponatraemia, and hypokalemia, which can worsen renal blood flow. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have become popular because they may have unique kidney-protective properties. All ACE inhibitors, with the exception of fosinopril, require reduced dosage and/or less frequent dosing in patients with renal impairment. It is often necessary to use a diuretic with an ACE inhibitor, and special dosing considerations are important. Due to demographic and physiological characteristics of patients with renal insufficiency, beta-blockers are often patients with other indications for beta-blockers, such as B. ischemic heart disease reserved. Some beta-blockers are primarily eliminated by the kidneys and dose reductions are required for these agents. Calcium antagonists can also have kidney-protective effects. Since calcium channel blockers are extensively metabolised, significant dose adjustments are not required. Data suggest that antihypertensive drugs may slow the rate of decline in renal failure. The pharmacokinetics of some antihypertensive drugs change with impaired renal function due to reduced elimination. Therefore, frequent dose adjustments, slower titration, and less frequent dosing are required.",0,0
1432,7751417,"Selected aspects of ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with renal disease: influence on proteinuria, lipids and potassium.",,"Keilani, T; Schlueter, W; Batlle, D","Overt proteinuria is often accompanied by hypercholesterolemia and is associated with elevated lipoprotein(a) levels. These lipid abnormalities are likely implicated in the high incidence of macrovascular complications associated with diabetic nephropathy and possibly other types of non-diabetic proteinuric kidney disease. Over the past decade, many studies have shown that ACE inhibitors can reduce urinary protein excretion, but little attention has been paid to the impact of this form of therapeutic intervention on lipid profiles. In this article, we review our recent data showing that fosinopril administration was associated with a significant decrease in both urinary protein excretion, total serum cholesterol and plasma lp(a) levels. The use of ACE inhibitors in patients with renal impairment may lead to the development of hyperkalemia as a result of suppression of angiotensin II-mediated aldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland. Inhibition of aldosterone secretion may depend on the extent of inhibition of angiotensin II production in the circulation and also locally in the adrenal gland. Because the various ACE inhibitors exhibit different degrees of ACE inhibition at the tissue level, we postulated that angiotensin II-dependent aldosterone production is inhibited to a lesser extent by agents with low tissue affinity for the adrenal gland. The implications of this theoretical concept for the development of hyperkalemia in patients with renal impairment treated with ACE inhibitors are discussed.",0,0
1433,7751418,An individualized approach for hypertensive patients with kidney disease: six illustrative case studies.,,"Elliott, W J","One of the greatest challenges in medicine is in the field of therapeutics, where the doctor tries to match the needs of the individual patient with a specific pharmacopoeial drug in the dose that is most suitable for the treatment of the individual problem. A great deal of medical art is involved in this “matching process”, in which the scientific aspects of diagnosis and therapy meet the medical knowledge of clinical pharmacology. The abridged medical histories of six patients who contacted the author with specific questions about treatment for their hypertension and renal dysfunction illustrate the fact that one of many therapies could have lowered blood pressure in these patients, but each had a specific reason to try a single approach first. If doctors could better understand the results of clinical research and apply them to the treatment of specific patients, the choice of therapy could become more successful.",0,0

Fosinopril was administered at a dose of 10 mg once a day for 14 days. The results in both groups were similar, with no evidence of accumulation of fosinoprilat in patients with hepatic impairment. The mean (+/- SD) maximum observed plasma concentrations of fosinoprilat in healthy subjects were 112.0 +/- 67.2 ng/mL after the first dose and 144.1 +/- 61.7 ng/mL at steady state. The corresponding values for patients with hepatic impairment were 111.4 +/- 40.1 ng/mL and 140.2 +/- 50.9 ng/mL. The area under the serum concentration-time curve in healthy subjects was 790.7 +/- 431.0 ng.h/mL after the first dose and 940.3 +/- 400.4 ng.h/mL at steady state . Similar values were observed in patients with hepatic impairment: 926.0 +/- 293.9 ng.h/mL and 1,255.4 +/- 434.0 ng.h/mL for the first dose and steady state, respectively. No statistically significant differences in fosinoprilat pharmacokinetics were observed between healthy and hepatically-impaired subjects. The lack of accumulation can be attributed to the dual elimination pathway of fosinoprilat reported in previous studies. The renal excretion of fosinoprilat in patients with hepatic impairment prevents increased accumulation. The available results indicate that the starting dose of fosinopril used in hypertensive patients with normal kidney and liver function can also be used in patients with impaired liver function due to cirrhosis.",0,0

After a 3-week run-in period with placebo, patients were randomized to receive ramipril 5 mg once daily or nitrendipine 20 mg once daily in a double-blind design for 6 months. Blood pressure (BP), UAE, creatinine clearance and glycated hemoglobin were assessed at the end of the placebo period and after 1, 3 and 6 months of active treatment. Both ramipril and nitrendipine significantly reduced blood pressure levels without affecting glucose homeostasis and renal function.

Patients (aged 35-69 years) were included if they were not receiving antihypertensive drugs and had supine DBPs between 90 and 104 mmHg after 6 months of non-pharmacological treatment; 220 patients were randomized to enalapril (20 or 40 mg/day) and 218 to atenolol (50 or 100 mg/day). After 12 months of treatment, atenolol significantly (p<0.01) increased glucose concentrations at 60, 90, and 120 minutes after an oral ingestion of 75 g glucose, while enalapril did not. Atenolol significantly increased fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations 120 minutes after glucose intake, while enalapril did not. Plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides increased significantly in patients receiving atenolol but not in those receiving enalapril. HDL cholesterol decreased significantly in the atenolol group but not in the enalapril group. The proportions of patients with clinical side effects were similar in both treatment groups. These results indicate that enalapril does not affect either glucose tolerance or lipoprotein metabolism, while atenolol does. These results are consistent over the 12-month treatment period and confirm previous short-term study results.",0,0

There was a significant correlation between both baseline and mean plasma total cholesterol levels and the decrease in renal function and increase in albuminuria in the placebo-treated patients. This correlation persisted after stratification for blood pressure. Treatment with enalapril did not eliminate these correlations. Cholesterol may be an additional risk factor for diabetic nephropathy. ACE inhibitors may have a modest cholesterol-lowering effect in diabetics, mediated in part by decreasing albuminuria.",0,0

Addition of felodipine or ramipril to long-term treatment with beta-blockade.,,"Siewert-Delle, A; Ljungman, S; Hartford, M; Wikstrand, J","The effect of intensified blood pressure control with a reduction in diastolic blood pressure to < or = 85 mm Hg on renal function and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was evaluated in 28 men with primary hypertension (aged 62 to 72 years) treated for 13+ /- 5 years on beta-blockade, diuretics or hydralazine. They were compared to 25 age-matched men with normotonia (NT). At baseline (BL), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF) (clearance of inulin and paraaminohippurate), and UAE were assessed. Thereafter, all antihypertensive drugs except beta-blockers were withdrawn and either felodipine (5 to 20 mg; n=13) or ramipril (2.5 to 10 mg; n=15) was added in a double-blind, randomized manner. If necessary, hydrochlorothiazide was added. The investigations were repeated after 6 weeks and 1 year of double-blind treatment. In BL, blood pressure and renal vascular resistance (RVR) were significantly higher and GFR and RPF were significantly lower in both hypertensive groups than in NT. At 1 year, the BP treatment goal was achieved by all patients in the felodipine group but only by two-thirds in the ramipril group, despite additional diuretics in 60% of the latter group. In the felodipine group, BP, GFR and RVR were no longer significantly different from normal after 1 year. The UAE and fractionated albumin clearance increased significantly in the felodipine group after one year of treatment, but did not change in the ramipril group. However, fractional albumin clearance was not significantly different from normal in either BL or after 1 year of treatment in any of the hypertensive groups. It is therefore possible to lower blood pressure and improve renal function in primary hypertension to levels not significantly different from normal after treatment with felodipine in combination with beta-blockade. Although this regimen slightly increased the low UAE, fractional albumin clearance changed less and was not significantly different from normal. The ramipril/beta-blocker combination lowered blood pressure less and did not alter mildly reduced renal function or UAE.",0,0

Captopril and thrombolysis study investigator.,,"Pinto, Y M; van Gilst, W H; Kingma, J H; Schunkert, H","This study sought to determine whether patients homozygous for the deletion (D) type allele of the angiotensin converting enzyme gene show increased ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction.; Recent evidence suggests that the angiotensin converting enzyme gene deletion-type allele (DD genotype) is associated with an increased prevalence of myocardial infarction and myocardial hypertrophy. However, it is not known whether the DD genotype is associated with adverse cardiac remodeling. To answer this question, we determined the genotype in patients enrolled in the Captopril and Thrombolysis Study (CATS), a prospective study in which patients received either captopril or placebo during and after thrombolysis for a first anterior myocardial infarction. Heart volume was determined by echocardiography immediately after thrombolysis and at the 1-year follow-up. The angiotensin-converting enzyme genotype was determined in 96 patients. Norepinephrine levels were determined during and immediately after thrombolysis.; Immediately after thrombolysis, cardiac volume did not differ between the genotype groups. However, at 1-year follow-up, both end-systolic and end-diastolic left ventricular volumes were significantly greater in the DD genotype group. Norepinephrine rose to higher levels in the DD genotype group receiving placebo therapy. Captopril treatment attenuated both norepinephrine surge and cardiac dilatation in the DD genotype group.; This exploratory study suggests that homozygosity for the angiotensin converting enzyme deletion type allele is associated with enhanced neurohumoral activation as well as enhanced cardiac dilation after acute anterior myocardial infarction, an effect consistent with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition can be vulnerable.",0,0
1443,7759839,Hypertension and the Vascular System: Arterioles and the Myogenic Response.,,"Izzard, A S; Heagerty, A M","This editorial was invited by the Journal of Hypertension to be part of a series aimed at reviewing our current knowledge of various aspects of the pathophysiology of hypertension. This article looks at small arteries and arterioles.; The conclusion that established hypertension is characterized by normal cardiac output and increased peripheral resistance represents the integration of insights from hemodynamic studies using a variety of disease models examined with several different techniques. In a way, all vascular beds are assumed to conform to the same response pattern. However, given the apparent heterogeneity in the functions performed by specialized tissues, recognized differences in receptor populations, and differences in innervation found in the vascular wall throughout the circulation, this may not be the case. Resistance to blood flow occurs throughout the vascular tree, but the majority is found at the arteriolar level. Small upstream arteries show growth and remodeling changes leading to lumen narrowing, but the exact contribution of such vessels to resistance is not yet known. Perhaps the most interesting recent finding in this regard is that, despite evidence of such structural changes in small arteries, blood pressure can drop immediately after the removal of a pressor stimulus. In addition, some whole animal studies have been reported that do not show the expected vascular enhancement when the total circulation is stressed.; Viewing the vascular tree as an integrated circuit with specialized functions in nourishing specific tissues suggests that an increase in resistance in one vascular bed due to constrictor challenge may not be representative of the circulation as a whole: in fact, resistance elsewhere may fall. It is likely that structural changes in small arteries result from hypertension. The pathogenesis of hypertension may lie downstream in arterioles, where a myogenic response may play a fundamental role.",0,0

Elevated neurohormone levels are associated with increased mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. Several studies have shown that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce mortality and morbidity in these patients. In left ventricular dysfunction (SOLVD) studies, enalapril significantly reduced mortality in patients with symptomatic LV dysfunction (treatment study). In contrast, in patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction (prevention study), there was no significant reduction in mortality with enalapril therapy. The effect of enalapril was studied in 333 patients from prevention studies and 129 patients from treatment studies. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) and plasma renin activity were measured in these patients at baseline and at 4 and 12 months of follow-up. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and arginine vasopressin were also measured in a subset of these patients. Analysis of covariance models was used to determine the effect of enalapril on each neurohormone.

Subjects were 2436 patients with onset of cough and up to 3 controls per case were obtained (total cohort: 7348 controls) matched for GP and concurrent consultation in the same 3 months. All cases and controls were 20 years of age or older and had no evidence of respiratory tract infections, influenza, tuberculosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, congestive heart failure, sinusitis, laryngitis, hemoptysis, or respiratory neoplasms during the 3-month period. Results showed that cases were 3.6 times more likely to have been exposed to ACE inhibitors than controls (95% CI: 2.4-5.5), but after adjusting for potential confounders, the odds ratio was 2.5 (95 %CI: 1.6-3.9). The crude odds ratio for males was 2.7 (95% CI: 1.4-5.1) and for females 4.2 (95% CI: 2.4-7.5). The adjusted odds ratio for males was 1.8 (95% CI: 0.9-3.5) and for females 2.7 (95% CI: 1.5-4.8).",0,0

1451,7774515,Ramipril. An updated review of therapeutic use in essential hypertension and heart failure.,,"Frampton, J E; Peters, D H","Ramipril is a second generation angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Like enalapril, it is a prodrug and is hydrolyzed in vivo to release the active metabolite ramiprilat, which has a long elimination half-life and allows for once-daily dosing. The antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril has been confirmed in large, non-comparative studies conducted in general practice, as well as in more strictly controlled clinical studies. In the former, approximately 85% of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension responded successfully to treatment with ramipril 2.5 or 5 mg/day, while comparative studies suggest that the drug's antihypertensive efficacy is equivalent to that of other established ACE inhibitors beta -Adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol. As expected, the response rate to ramipril monotherapy in patients with severe hypertension is lower (about 40%), although the antihypertensive effect may be enhanced by the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide or piretanide. The antihypertensive effect of ramipril is retained in patients with diabetes mellitus, and preliminary data indicate that the drug has the beneficial effect of reducing urinary albumin excretion in diabetic patients with nephropathy. Ramipril is superior to atenolol in inducing regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, although the clinical significance of this effect per se remains to be elucidated. The large AIRE study (Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy) showed that ramipril 5 or 10 mg/day significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 27% in patients with clinical evidence of heart failure after an acute myocardial infarction, even if it was transient. The beneficial effect of ramipril was evident after 30 days of treatment and appeared to be greatest in patients with more severe post-infarction ventricular damage. Ramipril is well tolerated in general practice, with 5% or fewer patients discontinuing therapy due to drug intolerance. The available data suggest that ramipril has a safety profile similar to that of other established ACE inhibitors. Clinical data thus confirm ramipril as a reasonable alternative ACE inhibitor for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension and indicate a beneficial effect of the drug in patients with clinically proven heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. It is also reasonable to assume that ramipril will be of value in the management of patients with advanced heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.",0,0

We studied 28 patients with PTE who were assigned to 3 matched groups. Group 1 (10 patients) received enalapril (Ena) 10 mg/day. At 2 months, the mean hematocrit (Ht) had fallen from 0.57 (range 0.52-0.62) to 0.45 (0.34-0.49). Ena was discontinued and after a period of 3.8 +/- 0.3 months Ht had returned to baseline values (0.56, range 0.52-0.61) in 8 of them. These 8 patients then received 5 mg/day Ena. Ht declined more slowly, reaching a mean of 0.49 (0.44-0.54) at 3 months. Group 2 (9 patients) received Theo 600 mg/day in 2 doses. At 2 months, Ht had decreased from 0.56 (0.52-0.61) to 0.52 (0.46-0.63), but Ht remained above 0.51 in 5 patients. After stopping treatment for 1 month, PTE persisted in 7 patients. These patients received 10 mg/day Ena, whereupon Ht increased from 0.55 (0.52-0.64) to 0.46 (0.40-0.53) at 2 months and to 0.41 (0.33-0.53) 0.47) decreased after 3 months. Group 3 received no medical treatment. At 3 months, PTE persisted in 8 of the 9 patients and remained unchanged for the following 3 months. The mean values for Ht were: baseline 0.55 (0.52-0.58); at 3 months 0.56 (0.53-0.59); and at 6 months 0.55 (0.52-0.60). We conclude that Ena is superior to Theo in treating PTE. There were no resistant patients, but individual susceptibility varies. Its effect is dose-dependent, reversible and reproducible. Excessive Ht decrease may occur; Therefore, doses should be titrated individually.",0,0

1454,7781377,Acute myocardial infarction. Then and now.,,"Simmons, J; Willens, H J; Kessler, K M","Dramatic changes in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have occurred over the past decade. While previous treatment strategies have been primarily supportive, current strategies focus on achieving and maintaining infarct-related artery patency to restore blood flow to compromised myocytes, preserve left ventricular function, and prevent recurrence and complications, and promote healing. Restoration of blood flow can be achieved pharmacologically with thrombolytics or mechanically with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Early use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs helps maintain patency of infarcted arteries and prevent thromboembolic complications. Administration of beta-blockers and angiotensin enzyme inhibitors are more specific means of preserving myocardium and ventricular function. In addition, several arrhythmia prevention strategies such as prophylactic use of lidocaine and routine long-term suppression of premature ventricular contractions with antiarrhythmic drugs are no longer routinely advocated. Basically, in the era prior to the eighth decade of this century, the primary direction of therapeutic strategy for AMI was to reduce oxygen demand in the infarcted myocardium; whereas in subsequent years the focus shifts to improving oxygenation through thrombolysis, PTCA and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. These sweeping changes, when coupled with more sophisticated use of drugs to reduce oxygen demand, resulted in significant reductions in myocardial mortality.",0,0

Treadmill exercise tests according to the modified Naughton protocol were performed at baseline and after six, eleven and twelve weeks of treatment. Signs and symptoms of heart failure were assessed at each visit. A physical examination was performed and left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at baseline and at 12 weeks; Mean (SD) baseline exercise test times increased from 434 (162) s and 480 (157) s for the felodipine and placebo groups, respectively, to 541 (217) s and 591 (218) s, respectively, at 12 weeks or at the last visit.

Cardiac output and renal and limb blood flow were measured after oral indomethacin 50 mg or placebo followed by an ""open"" intravenous infusion of prostaglandin E2 (Study A). In a second study, the same measurements were taken after 50 mg oral indomethacin or placebo was administered 30 minutes before ""open"" captopril (Study B); Blood pressure was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer. Cardiac output was determined by Doppler interrogation of blood flow in the ascending aorta and echocardiographic measurement of the aortic root diameter. Renal blood flow was calculated from the effective renal plasma flow measured by p-aminohippurate clearance and hematocrit and the glomerular filtration rate by endogenous creatinine clearance. Blood flow in the extremities was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography using mercury in Silastic strain gauges. The concentration of plasma prostaglandin E2 was measured by radioimmunoassay.; University Clinic for Cardiovascular Medicine.; 12 patients with chronic stable heart failure before starting treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.; Indomethacin produced adverse effects on cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, renal blood flow, glomerular filtration, urinary sodium excretion, and calf vascular resistance. The changes were reversed by infusion of prostaglandin E2. Pretreatment with indomethacin attenuated the acute increases in cardiac output and decreases in systemic vascular resistance seen with captopril. Similarly, an increase in renal blood flow with captopril was attenuated by indomethacin. The acute side effects of indomethacin on central and peripheral hemodynamics and renal function suggest that prostaglandins play an important role in the regulation of peripheral blood flow and renal function in patients with stable chronic heart failure. The indomethacin-induced improvement in hemodynamic function and renal blood flow by captopril is consistent with the hypothesis that captopril may act in part by increasing prostaglandin synthesis.",0,0

They underwent M-mode and Doppler echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography at baseline and after six weeks of treatment with enalapril. In this study, all patients treated with the ACE inhibitor enalapril responded with a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (p<0.001). After six weeks of treatment with enalapril, there was a significant reduction in left ventricle and mass index (p < 0.01).

Secondary endpoints include all-cause cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Eligibility criteria include sustained seated systolic blood pressure of 160 to 219 mm Hg and sustained seated diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 109 mm Hg. Standing systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg is also required. Patients must provide informed consent and must not have congestive heart failure requiring treatment, gout, renal failure, or recent cerebral hemorrhage. Patients are randomized into 3 groups (i) no treatment; (ii) treatment with a diuretic [bendroflumethiazide (bendrofluazide)]; or (iii) treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril). The starting dose for bendroflumethiazide and lisinopril is 2.5 mg/day. In order to achieve targeted systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (< 150/80 mm Hg), a doubling of the dosage is allowed. In addition, slow-release diltiazem (120 mg/day, increasing to 240 mg/day if needed) can be added to the medication of the actively treated groups. These drugs were chosen as inexpensive and useful representatives of their therapeutic classes. 700 patients in each group (2100 total) are sufficient to detect a 40% difference in cerebrovascular events between no treatment and active treatment (alpha = 0.01, 1-beta = 0.90). These figures also show a difference in all-cause mortality of 25% and cardiovascular mortality of 35%. The pilot phase of the study was started with support from the British Heart Foundation.

1470,7805462,Combined therapy of captopril and spironolactone for refractory congestive heart failure.,,"Han, Y L; Tong, M; Jing, Q M; Hu, X L; Liu, J Q","It has traditionally been assumed that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and spironolactone could not be used concomitantly because of the perceived risk of hyperkalemia. However, despite ACEI therapy, edema and congestive status remain in some patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). To find an effective therapy for these patients, we observed the efficacy and safety of Captopil plus spironolactone in patients with refractory CHF with close monitoring of renal function, serum and urinary electrolytes, and blood pressure (BP). Thirty-five patients with refractory CHF and New York Heart Association functional class IV without renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia, whose plasma aldosterone (ALD) levels were above normal in 88.6% of them, were randomized to Group A (n=16 , captopril alone) and B (n=19, captopril plus spironolactone) for 4 weeks of treatment. Dosing of both drugs was time-adjusted individually according to serum potassium and renal function results. The improvement in dyspnea-fatigue scores, urinary volume, and Na+/K+ ratio in group B was more significant than in group A, and plasma ALD levels in group B apparently decreased while in group A it remained high after therapy. Two patients in Group B, who had normal plasma ALD levels prior to therapy with a urinary Na+/K+ ratio > 1.0, showed no clinical improvement. A strong negative correlation was found between plasma ALD levels and urinary Na+/K+ ratio (correlation coefficient -0.689, P<0.01).

Although no systematic experimental studies or controlled clinical observations are available, lithium is known to activate the renin-angiotensin system through multiple mechanisms. In addition, direct interactions between lithium and angiotensin II can take place at the cellular level. We propose that (1) renal function should be closely monitored when patients treated with lithium receive angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and (2) the doses of both drugs should be chosen with caution to avoid serious drug interactions avoid.",0,0
1474,7811401,Mechanisms of unpredictable adverse drug reactions.,,"Rieder, M J","Adverse drug reactions are common problems associated with therapy and major causes of morbidity and mortality. There are numerous types of drug reactions, including predictable drug reactions such as side effects, toxicity, drug interactions, and secondary effects that can be anticipated when planning therapy. There are also a number of unforeseen side effects that are unexpected consequences of therapy. The least serious unforeseen side effect of the drug is intolerance, which appears to be an exaggeration of the drug's pharmacological or toxic effects in at-risk subgroups of patients. Some of the most serious and life-threatening adverse drug reactions are allergic reactions. These side effects can be mediated through a number of mechanisms, including the development of drug-specific IgE, serum sickness-like reactions in response to drug-antibody complexes, direct release of inflammatory mediators, or immune system involvement through mechanisms that cause these are poorly understood. Idiosyncratic adverse reactions are a heterogeneous group of adverse reactions that are not predictable from the pharmacological effects of the drug. Many of these reactions occur as a result of pharmacogenetic variations in drug bioactivation and drug or metabolite detoxification or clearance. The doctor must be aware of the possibility of unpredictable side effects during or after therapy. Research currently underway may offer the opportunity to predict and hopefully prevent some of these side effects in the future.",0,0

The walking distance of patients with claudication improved in all patients while participating in an exercise program. For both treatment groups, this improvement was significant (p<0.05) compared to baseline, from 264 m at baseline to 313 m with bisoprolol and to 400 m with lisinopril. The difference between the two drugs was not significant. In patients without peripheral obstructive vascular disease, we found a significant (p<0.05) reduction in blood flow for both drugs.

Venous blood samples were collected at rest, before blinded treatment, and after 12 weeks of study drug treatment. In the first cooperative North Scandinavian enalapril survival study (CONSENSUS I), a probability prediction score for mortality derived by stepwise linear discriminants from neurohormonal data was used to assess the combined activity of the different neurohormonal systems.; Plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide were elevated at baseline, but concentrations of angiotensin II, aldosterone, and norepinephrine were within normal limits. However, there was a large inter-individual variation. Plasma norepinephrine concentration and predictive value were higher in patients with New York Heart Association class III congestive heart failure than in patients with class II congestive heart failure (p<0.05). There was a modest but significant inverse correlation between exercise duration at baseline and plasma norepinephrine concentration (r = -0.21, p = 0.0023), aldosterone concentration (r = -0.14, p = 0.04) and the predicted value (r = -0.24, P = 0.0004). The predictive value at baseline was significantly higher for the deceased (n=10) than for the survivors (P=0.03). Angiotensin converting enzyme activity was suppressed and plasma concentrations of aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide were reduced after 12 weeks of treatment with ramipril compared to placebo. In patients with the most pronounced neurohormonal activation at baseline (top third of norepinephrine concentration or prediction score), norepinephrine concentration and prediction score were significantly lower after 12 weeks of dosing with ramipril compared to placebo. Patients with a predictive value in the highest third at baseline had a higher heart rate than those in the lowest third (P=0.003).; Neurohormonal activation is associated with symptom severity and disease severity in mild or moderate congestive heart failure. Treatment with ramipril dampens neurohormonal activation. This effect is most pronounced in patients with the highest circulating neurohormone concentrations prior to treatment initiation.",0,0

Therefore, it is of interest to compare the effects of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to the treatment of hypertension on the reduction of LVM.; Changes in LV structure were assessed by M-mode echocardiograms in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 844 mildly hypertensive participants randomized to receive nutritional hygiene (NH) intervention plus placebo or NH plus one of five antihypertensive drug classes: (1st ) diuretic (chlorthalidone), (2) beta blocker (acebutolol), (3) alpha antagonist (doxazosin mesylate), (4) calcium antagonist (amlodipine maleate), or (5) angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril -maleate). ). Echocardiograms were performed at baseline, after 3 months, and annually for 4 years. Blood pressure changes averaged 16/12 mm Hg in the active treatment groups and 9/9 mm Hg in the NH group. All groups demonstrated a significant decrease (10% to 15%) in LVM from baseline that occurred at 3 months and persisted at 48 months. The chlorthalidone group experienced the greatest decrease at each follow-up visit (average decrease 34 g), although differences with other groups were small (average decrease among 5 other groups 24 to 27 g). Participants randomized to the NH intervention had only similar mean changes in LVM as participants randomized to the NH intervention plus pharmacologic treatment. The greatest difference between groups was observed at 12 months, with mean decreases ranging from 35 g (chlortalidone group) to 17 g (acebutolol group) (p=0.001 comparing all groups). Analysis within the group showed that changes in weight, urinary sodium excretion and systolic blood pressure correlated moderately with changes in LVM and were statistically significant in most analyses.; NH intervention with an emphasis on weight loss and dietary sodium reduction is as effective as NH intervention plus pharmacologic treatment in reducing echocardiographically determined LVM despite less blood pressure reduction in the NH intervention-only group. A possible exception is that the addition of diuretics (chlorthalidone) may have a small additional effect on lowering LVM.",0,0

M-mode echocardiography and plasma hormone concentrations were available at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment. There was a significant relationship between LV systolic function and levels of angiotensin II and norepinephrine. Enalapril increased fractional LV shortening (FS%) (13.3 +/- 5.6 to 15.4 +/- 5.8, p<0.05) and decreased systolic time interval index (0.58 +/- 0.14 to 0.48 +/- 0.15, p<0.05) concomitant with a significant decrease in angiotensin converting enzyme activity and in aldosterone, angiotensin II and norepinephrine concentrations at 6 weeks. No changes were found in the placebo group. However, there was no direct relationship between the magnitude of the change in neurohormones and the improvement in LV function at 6 weeks. These results indicate that in patients with severe chronic CHF, severe LV systolic dysfunction is associated with high plasma levels of angiotensin II and norepinephrine, which can be favorably modified by enalapril. This may be important for prolonging life in severe heart failure. The lack of a relationship between changes in individual hormones and systolic function suggests a complex dynamic interaction. It is therefore not sufficient to predict changes in LV function by measuring changes in just one hormone.",0,0

From the analysis of efficacy, one patient from the lisinopril and two patients from the nifedipine group were excluded because their supine DBP was < 95 mmHg after walk-in. Adverse reactions, mostly transient during the initial treatment period, and discontinuations occurred in six (4.1%) and three (2.1%) patients in the lisinopril group and in 12 (8.2%; NS) and three (2.0 %) patients in the nifedipine group at group or After the 6-week treatment period, the lisinopril group showed 19 non-responders (reverse DBP > or = 95 mmHg) of the remaining 142 patients and the nifedipine group showed 20 non-responders of the remaining 142 patients. The initial supine and standing heart rates were similar in both groups. Lying heart rate decreased significantly in the lisinopril group, while standing heart rate in this group and supine and standing heart rates in the nifedipine group did not change significantly with treatment.

1491,7848623,Albumin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase urinary excretion in mild hypertension.,,"Abraham, P A; Mascioli, S R; Launer, C A; Flack, J M; Liebson, P R; Svendsen, K H; Grandits, G A; Opsahl, J A; Schoenberger, J A; Grimm, R H","Effects on the kidneys in mild hypertension and therapy have not been demonstrated. Because urinary albumin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase excretion reflect the renal effects of hypertension, they were associated with blood pressure, other cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac target organ effects, and response to therapy in mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 85-99 mmHg). Participants were from two sites in the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS), a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study. Participants received nutritional therapy and one of five drugs or a placebo. Urinary albumin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase excretion were analyzed prospectively using office ""spot"" collections from one clinic (n = 213) and retrospectively using overnight collections from the other clinic (n = 210). Relationships between protein excretion and blood pressure, age, sex, race, blood glucose, cholesterol concentrations, and indices of body mass and left ventricular mass and function at baseline were determined. Treatment effects were assessed after 3 to 12 months. Spot and overnight albumin excretions were positively correlated with baseline systolic blood pressure according to univariate analyses. Spot albumin excretion was positively correlated with systolic blood pressure, age, creatinine clearance and left ventricular function, while overnight albumin excretion was positively correlated with left ventricular mass and female sex according to multiple regression analysis. Selectively, but not overnight, albumin excretion decreased significantly under active drug therapy. The excretion of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase was not related to blood pressure or the drop during therapy. The combined results suggest that albumin excretion is correlated with blood pressure, decreases with antihypertensive drug therapy, and is associated with greater left ventricular function and mass and glomerular filtration rate, even in mild hypertension.",0,0

Patients who did not achieve an adequate response after 6 weeks of monotherapy received a combination therapy of diltiazem 120 mg twice daily and enalapril 10 mg once daily. Of the 147 patients enrolled in the study, 70 received diltiazem and 77 received enalapril; 17 patients subsequently received combination therapy. Blood pressure reductions in patients who completed 12 weeks of therapy were (seated values): diltiazem 120 mg, 10.2/15.2 mmHg; diltiazem 180 mg, 19.1/14.7 mmHg; enalapril 10 mg, 25.7/17.5 mmHg; Enalapril 20 mg, 19.6/14.0 mmHg; and combination therapy 24.6/15.1 mmHg.

Two patients dropped out of the enalapril group and 8 out of the diltiazem group. No unexpected side effects were observed during the study and no deaths occurred in any treatment group. Extended-release diltiazem 120 or 180 mg twice daily was found to be an effective antihypertensive and was equal in efficacy and patient acceptance to enalapril 10 or 20 mg once daily. The combination therapy was effective in lowering blood pressure in patients in whom monotherapy was ineffective.",0,0

As a result of this methodological limitation, no data are available on the effects of long-term antihypertensive therapy on global arterial impedance properties and indices of myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). Using recently validated non-invasive techniques, we compared the effects of chronic oral treatment with ramipril, nifedipine and atenolol on arterial impedance and mechanical dissipation and indices of MVO2 in hypertensive patients.; Sixteen African American subjects with systemic hypertension were studied using a randomized, double-blind, crossover protocol. Instantaneous central aortic pressure and flow, from which arterial stress characteristics can be derived, were estimated from calibrated subclavian pulse recordings (SPTs) and continuous wave aortic Doppler velocity coupled with two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic measurements of the aortic ring. To derive ventricular wall tension and MVO2 indices, left ventricular short (M-mode) and long axis (2D echo) images were acquired simultaneously with SPTs. Data were collected at the end of a 2-week washout period (pre-administration control) and after 6 weeks of treatment with each agent. Although all three drugs reduced diastolic blood pressure to the same extent, different effects on mean and systolic pressure and vascular impedance characteristics were noted. Nifedipine decreased total peripheral resistance (TPR; 1744 +/- 398 versus 1290 +/- 215 dyne-s/cm5) and increased arterial compliance (ACL; 1.234 +/- 0.253 versus 1.776 +/- 0.415 mL/mm Hg) . This improvement in arterial compliance was not fully explained by the reduction in stretch pressure. Ramipril also decreased TPR (1740 +/- 292 versus 1437 +/- 290 dyne-s/cm5) and increased ACL (1.214 +/- 0.190 versus 1.569 +/- 0.424 mL/mm Hg), but this changed with this agent arterial compliance was explained solely by a reduction in stretch pressure. In contrast, atenolol affected neither TPR nor ACL. Consistent with the compliance results, nifedipine and ramipril significantly decreased the first two harmonics of the impedance spectrum, but atenolol did not. Neither of these agents resulted in a significant change in the characteristic impedance or relative amplitude of the reflected pressure wave. Total vascular mechanical power and percentage of vibrational power remained unchanged with all antihypertensive treatments. Only ramipril and nifedipine reduced the integral of both meridional and circumferential systolic wall stresses, indicating that MVO2 per beat was reduced with these drugs. The stress-time index, a measure of MVO2 per unit time, decreased significantly with ramipril but not with nifedipine, since an increase in heart rate was seen in 10 out of 16 patients (mean increase 10 beats per minute). Thus, a decrease in MVO2 associated with an unchanged total mechanical vascular performance indicates an improved efficiency of ventriculoarterial coupling with ramipril and with nifedipine in the subgroup of patients in which the heart rate was unchanged. In contrast, there was no evidence of a reduction in wall stress, stress integral, or stress-time index with atenolol.; The non-invasive methodology used in this study represents a new tool for serial and simultaneous assessment of arterial hemodynamics and left ventricular energetics in systemic hypertension. In this study, we demonstrate the differential effects of chronic antihypertensive therapies on systemic arterial circulation and MVO2 indices in African American subjects. Accounting for drug-induced differential arterial stress responses and MVO2 indices with each drug may provide a more physiological approach to the management of systemic hypertension in individual patients",0,0

Nineteen hemodialysis patients (7 males; mean age: 55 +/- 13 years; mean dialysis time: 44 +/- 35 months) received lisinopril for 6 months in addition to their existing antihypertensive regimens (mean: 1.4 +/- 0.8 drugs ). Doses of antihypertensive drugs were adjusted to keep both systolic and diastolic blood pressure stable. Nine patients were discontinued from lisinopril treatment after 43 +/- 33 days because of hypotension (n=4), withdrawal of consent (n=3), stroke (n=1), and cough (n=1). Seven of them were further studied as controls. Ten patients received an average of 6.4 +/- 4 mg lisinopril over 6 months. The mean myocardial mass calculated by M-mode echocardiography was 324 +/- 103 g before and 313 +/- 79 g after 6 months of treatment with lisinopril. In the control patients, the myocardial mass was 318 +/- 110 g initially and 334 +/- 159 g after 6 months. Early and late transmissral diastolic flow velocities were not significantly affected by lisinopril. Mean 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure both remained stable throughout the study (systolic: before: 145 +/- 19 mmHg, at 6 months: 147 +/- 17 mmHg; diastolic: before: 87 +/- 12 mmHg, at 6 months 87 +/- 10 mmHg). Therefore, no specific effect of lisinopril on regression of myocardial hypertrophy or improvement in diastolic function could be observed in this small group of hemodialysis patients over a 6-month period.",0,0

It compares tight blood pressure control (target < 150/85 mmHg) to less stringent control (target < 180/105 mmHg) and within the tight control group an ACE inhibitor, captopril, to a beta-blocker, atenolol. We report the efficacy, treatment side effects, biochemical responses, and occurrence of hypoglycemia in 755 patients (mean age 57 years, blood pressure 150/94 mmHg) followed for 2 years. At 2 years, blood pressure was 143/84 in the close control group and 156/90 mmHg in the less close control group (p<0.0001). Blood pressure reduction, treatment adherence, occurrence of side effects and hypoglycaemia were similar under captopril and atenolol. Patients receiving atenolol had a greater increase in body weight (+2.3 vs. +0.7 kg, p<0.01) and a non-significant trend towards greater increases in triglycerides than patients receiving captopril. A large blood pressure difference was obtained between the strict control group and the less strict control group, with captopril and atenolol having similar antihypertensive effects. The study has the potential to determine whether strict blood pressure control reduces the incidence of diabetic complications and whether therapy with ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers is clinically beneficial.",0,0

Animal studies suggest that treating hypertension can restore normal NO-mediated responses. We prospectively evaluated the effect of standard antihypertensive therapy on the response to local intra-arterial infusions of L-NMMA in 18 newly diagnosed hypertensive patients.; This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. Patients were randomized to treatment with enalapril 10 mg daily, amlodipine 5 mg daily, or matched placebo for 6 weeks (with dose titration after 2 weeks, if necessary). Forearm blood flow during direct infusion of L-NMMA (1, 2, and 4 μmol/min) into the brachial artery was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography at the beginning and end of the 6-week treatment period; Both enalapril and amlodipine significantly reduced blood pressure compared to placebo. After 6 weeks of antihypertensive therapy, forearm blood flow (+/- SEM) in response to the maximum dose of L-NMMA (4 µmol/min) was 54.8 (6.9)% (p = 0.012), 58, 9 (7.0) reduced. % (p=0.016) and 33.1 (3.0)% (p=0.17) in the enalapril, amlodipine and placebo groups, respectively. There was no significant difference between the enalapril and amlodipine treatment groups.; Forearm artery response to L-NMMA in newly diagnosed patients with essential hypertension normalizes with normalization of blood pressure by antihypertensive drugs with different modes of action.

Sodium and potassium were measured in erythrocytes by flame photometry at baseline and after 26 weeks of active treatment in the hypertensive patients and also in 28 age- and sex-matched normotensive controls. There was a significant positive relationship between intra-arterial BP and intra-erythrocyte sodium in untreated hypertensive subjects, but there was no significant difference in mean intra-erythrocyte sodium or potassium between hypertensive and normotensive subjects at baseline. However, the distribution of intraerythrocyte sodium values differed between hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Supine MAP was reduced from 113 +/- 4 to 97 +/- 3 mmHg and from 110 +/- 3 to 102 +/- 2 mmHg with enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide treatment, respectively. Blood pressure reduction with enalapril was associated with a significant decrease in red blood cell sodium (P=0.02), while hydrochlorothiazide had no effect. There was no significant correlation between delta MAP and delta intraerythrocyte sodium in either group at 26 weeks. Intra-erythrocyte potassium did not change with treatment with either drug. In conclusion, there was a significant relationship between intra-arterial BP and intra-erythrocyte sodium in untreated hypertensive subjects.

Captopril and thrombolysis study.,,"Dambrink, J H; Tuininga, Y S; van Gilst, W H; Peels, K H; Lie, K I; Kingma, J H","Reduced heart rate variability has been identified as an important prognostic factor after myocardial infarction. This factor is thought to reflect an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity that can lead to unfavorable stress conditions and thus promote left ventricular dilatation.; 298 patients in a multicenter clinical trial were randomized to either captopril or placebo after a first anterior myocardial infarction. All patients were treated with streptokinase prior to randomization. In the present sub-study complete data including heart rate variability and echocardiographic measurements from 80 patients were available. Patients were divided into two groups: those with a reduced (< or = 25) heart rate variability index and those with a normal heart rate variability index (> 25). Heart rate variability was assessed by 24-hour Holter monitoring before discharge. Left ventricular volumes were determined by echocardiography before discharge and three and twelve months after myocardial infarction. The extent of myocardial damage, severity of coronary artery disease, functional class, hemodynamic variables, and medication were also considered possible determinants of left ventricular dilatation.; Before discharge, the end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes did not differ between the two groups. At 12 months, patients with reduced heart rate variability had increased end-systolic volume (mean (SD)) by 6 (14) mL/m2 (p=0.043) and end-diastolic volume by 8 (17) mL/m2 (p=0.024) . Left ventricular volumes were unchanged in patients with normal heart rate variability. In addition, patients with left ventricular dilatation had larger enzymatic infarct size and higher heart rates and rate-pressure products. A reduced pre-discharge heart rate variability index was an independent risk factor for left ventricular dilatation during follow-up. Measurement of heart rate variability at three months had no predictive value for this event.; Determination of the heart rate variability index before discharge but not after three months provided important additional information for identifying patients at risk of left ventricular dilatation.",0,0

Participating physicians followed their standard practice procedures for initiating quinapril therapy (a dose of 10 mg QD in the majority of cases). Dose was titrated according to blood pressure response, generally at 2-week intervals, for a maintenance dose of 10 mg QD to 20 mg QD in most cases (86% at 6 months) and no more than 40 mg QD. The concomitant administration of antihypertensive drugs was at the discretion of the physician. Through random assignment, physicians obtained the patient's informed consent to either a detailed form listing possible side effects of quinapril or a less specific form that did not list certain side effects. The purpose of using two different forms was to assess any potential association between the frequency of adverse event reporting and patient awareness of the side effects of quinapril. Patients also received an education pack containing general information about high blood pressure and lifestyle changes known to reduce cardiovascular risk factors. An intent-to-treat analysis included data from 3742 patients with a mean age of 56 years and a mean duration of hypertension of 5 years. The demographics of these patients were similar to those found in a recent population-based survey of Canadian hypertensive patients. Nearly 80% of patients in the ACCEPT study had more than one cardiovascular risk factor in addition to hypertension. Of 2979 patients who received quinapril at 3 months, 77% were stabilized. Of 2517 patients who continued to receive quinapril after 6 months, 84% were stabilized. Patients who continued to receive quinapril as part of an antihypertensive regimen had greater reductions in both diastolic and systolic blood pressure than those who discontinued quinapril. The blood pressure response to quinapril was similar in newly diagnosed patients and patients with a history of hypertension. A total of 980 patients (26.2%) reported one or more adverse events. Cough was the most frequently reported and was considered by the treating physician to be clearly related to quinapril therapy in 3.6% of cases.

None of the patients developed hypotension or orthostatic hypotension at the first dose and there was no significant change in heart rate in either group. Serum K+ levels remained unchanged in both patient groups. Both drugs were well tolerated and no adverse effects on the liver, kidneys, blood sugar or the hematopoietic system were observed. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the antihypertensive effect of 5 mg ramipril in a once daily dose is equivalent to that of 50 mg captopril twice daily. However, a significantly larger number of patients reported an improvement in the ""quality of life"" parameters with ramipril compared to captopril. Thus, for the routine treatment of mild to moderate arterial hypertension, ramipril offers reliable antihypertensive efficacy in a once-daily dose, thereby helping to improve patient compliance and make treatment more economical.",1,0
1507,7861706,Differences in hormonal and renal vascular responses between normotensive patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and unaffected family members.,,"Barrett, B J; Foley, R; Morgan, J; Hefferton, D; Parfrey, P","We tested the hypothesis that overactivity of the renal and systemic renin-angiotensin system is important for the pathogenesis of hypertension in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Up to 21 normotensive subjects with ADPKD and creatinine clearance > 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 were compared to 12 unaffected controls from the same families. Blood pressure, serum chemistry, sodium excretion, plasma renin and serum aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels were measured at baseline, after acute sodium deficiency, and after chronically elevated sodium intake with and without enalapril. Effective renal plasma flow was measured by higher sodium paraaminohippurate clearance before and during an intravenous infusion of angiotensin II at 3 ng/kg/min. This was to test whether, in analogy to non-modulating essential hypertension, the renal blood flow would drop to a lesser extent in ADPKD subjects. The groups were comparable at baseline, except for a higher mean supine arterial pressure in the ADPKD group (median 91 vs. 81 mm Hg, P=0.002). There were no significant differences between ADPKD and controls in blood pressure or hormonal response to sodium deficiency. During chronically higher sodium intake, serum ANP was significantly higher (median 130 vs. 81 ng/liter, P=0.0006) and plasma renin tended to be higher (median 20.5 vs. 13.5, P=0.08) in ADPKD than in controls. The ADPKD group had higher renal vascular resistance (median 7420 vs 5915 dyn.sec.cm-5, P=0.009) before angiotensin but tended to have a smaller percentage increase in resistance during angiotensin (median 31.5 vs 46, P=0.14).(SUMMARY TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0

Its main objective is to assess the relationship between three levels of target diastolic blood pressure (< or = 90, < or = 85, or < or = 80 mmHg) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. In addition, the study will examine the effects on morbidity and mortality of a low dose of 75 mg acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) or placebo. In the HOT study, antihypertensive basic treatment with the calcium antagonist felodipine is initiated at a dose of 5 mg daily. If goal blood pressure is not reached, add-on antihypertensive therapy with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a beta-blocker is given. Further dose adjustments are made according to an established protocol. As a fifth and final step, a diuretic can be added. Patient enrollment was discontinued on April 30, 1994. At this point, 19,196 patients had been randomized. There were 9,055 (47%) women and 10,141 (53%) men with a mean age of 61.5 +/- 7.5 (SD) years. At study entry, 52% of patients were receiving antihypertensive treatment. These patients entered a washout period of at least 2 weeks prior to randomization.

In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study of the ACE inhibitor captopril, its antianginal and antiischemic effects during monotherapy and in the presence of an organic nitrate were studied.; Thirty-seven patients (34 males, three females) with stable coronary artery disease and exercise-induced ST-segment depression were included. After a washout period without medication, they received placebo, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) 20 mg twice daily, captopril 12.5 mg twice daily and the combination of both for 1 week each, followed by exercise tolerance, blood pressure and heart rate (lying, standing and 24-hour profile) and peripheral arterial vasodilation (finger pulse plethysmography) were evaluated.; 33 patients completed all phases of the study. Exercise-induced anginal symptoms occurred in 17 patients and asymptomatic ischemia was observed in the other 16 men. Compared to ISDN, the anti-ischemic effects of captopril were minimal despite a similar reduction in blood pressure. Compared to baseline, 1 week placebo reduced the sum of ST-segment depression, the main efficacy parameter, by 10% (NS), captopril by 19% (NS), ISDN by 37% (P<0.001), and the combination of captopril and ISDN by 42% (P<0.001; NS versus ISDN). No patient remained completely free of exercise-induced angina during treatment with captopril; however, three patients did after ISDN and seven patients after the combination (P<0.05). Resting blood pressure decreased at maximum effect by 9-10% systolic (P<0.001) with monotherapy and by up to 7% diastolic (P<0.001) and by 18% systolic (P<0.001) during combination therapy with captopril and ISDN. ) and 12% diastolic (P<0.001). Significantly enhanced circulatory effects of captopril plus ISDN versus ISDN were found for blood pressure (P<0.001) and peripheral arterial vasodilation (P<0.01). The reflex tachycardia induced by ISDN in the upright position (5 beats/min) was not blocked by captopril during combination therapy.; The antianginal and antiischemic effects of captopril alone were marginal, despite significant circulatory effects after short-term administration. In contrast, although captopril in combination with ISDN resulted in a significant further antihypertensive effect and enhanced peripheral arterial vasodilation, the magnitude of the potentiation of the antiischemic nitrate effect was small. Only exercise-induced angina was further improved by use of the combination. No paradoxical worsening of ischemia or angina pectoris was observed after captopril. Although captopril has no place as a first-line therapy for ischemia, its use in combination with ISDN could be advantageous for the long-term prognosis.",0,0

Ramipril belongs to the more lipophilic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and can therefore easily enter the central nervous system.; We investigated whether rampiril has selective effects on the autonomic control of circulation in hypertension in humans compared to the more hydrophilic ACE inhibitor enalapril. Blood pressure, hemodynamics, and autonomic function measurements were performed in 13 patients with essential hypertension after 10 days of placebo and after crossover monotherapy of 10 days of enalapril versus 10 days of ramipril.; Both enalapril and ramipril significantly reduced systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure without a reflex increase in heart rate. Plasma renin activity increased significantly with each of the ACE inhibitors. There were no significant effects of either agent on plasma catecholamines (norepinephrine or adrenaline) or chromogranin A, biochemical indexes of efferent sympatho-adrenal outflow. There were also no significant changes after either agent in baroreflex sensitivity (to high and low pressure stimuli), response to cold stress, or sympathetic (alpha-adrenergic) involvement in blood pressure maintenance. There was a slight effect of ACE inhibition on sensitivity to alpha-1 adrenergic pressors, but the two compounds did not differ significantly in this regard.; Autonomic control of circulatory function was well maintained after either lipophilic (ramipril) or hydrophilic (enalapril) ACE inhibitors, and the lipophilic compound ramipril had no additional effects on autonomic function beyond those exhibited by the hydrophilic agent enalapril.",0,0

In the case of acute MI, coronary units as currently used are quite expensive but could be made much more efficient with more effective triage and resource use; Reperfusion via thrombolysis is cost-effective, as are beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after myocardial infarction in eligible patients. The cost-effectiveness of CAD screening tests is highly dependent on the prevalence of the disease in the population being studied. The cost-effectiveness of CABG operation depends on the target direction; eg, it is highly effective in conditions such as left ventricle and three-vessel disease, but not in less severe conditions. PTCA appears to be cost effective in situations where there is clinical consensus for its use, e.g. in severe ischemia and single-vessel disease, but requires further analysis based on randomized data; Coronary stents also appear to be inexpensive. In a preliminary analysis, ACE inhibition is dominant for CHF, meaning it saves both money and life. Heart transplantation appears to be inexpensive but requires further study. For cardiac arrhythmias, implantable cardioverter defibrillators are inexpensive in life-threatening situations, especially the transvenous device; Radiofrequency ablation is also cost-effective in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, except in asymptomatic individuals; and pacemakers were not analyzed, except in the case of biofascicular blockade, where the results varied depending on the situation and previous tests.",0,0

Serial changes were recorded in LV mass index, LV systolic function, and plasma concentrations of BNP and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP).; ACEI therapy significantly reduced LV mass index at 6 months and even more at 1 year. The thickness of the septum and posterior wall was also reduced. Plasma BNP and ANP were markedly elevated at baseline, but only BNP levels correlated with LV mass index. Both peptide levels decreased after 6 months and this decrease increased after 1 year. There was a close association between the fall in BNP and the reduction in LV mass index overall and with enalapril and lisinopril separately. Changes in ANP and LV mass index were not associated.; Long-term therapy with ACEI can reduce elevated plasma BNP. In this study, changes in BNP reflected the extent of regression of LVH.

Comparison with nifedipine.,,"Shimamoto, H; Shimamoto, Y","We compared the systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of nifedipine and lisinopril in 26 elderly hypertensive patients using pulsed Doppler ultrasound technique. Nifedipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist and lisinopril is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The study had a single-blind crossover design: nifedipine and lisinopril were each given for 8 weeks after a 4-week washout period. Both nifedipine and lisinopril significantly reduced mean arterial pressure to the same extent (p<0.01); Cardiac output remained unchanged in both the nifedipine and lisinopril treated groups. Lisinopril increased renal flow significantly (p<0.01), but nifedipine did not. The flows of the carotid, spine, celiac and superior mesenteric arteries, as well as the diaphragm and terminal aorta showed no significant change with either nifedipine or lisinopril. The specific effect of lisinopril on the thoracic aorta was a marked improvement in aortic compliance compared to nifedipine, which may partially account for an increase in renal flow. Lisinopril may provide more desirable regional hemodynamic effects and additional benefits for elderly hypertensive patients.",0,0

A typical dry cough is the main reason for discontinuation of ACE-I therapy. The data on the frequency, course and clinical significance of this side effect are contradictory. This study determined the occurrence of cough in patients with hypertension and CHF treated with ACE-I and to appreciate its clinical importance; 268 patients treated with ACE-I, 164 with hypertension and 104 with CHF, were followed prospectively for at least 1 year and specifically questioned about cough and other side effects. Those who developed a cough had a second and then a third ACE-I attempted. Cough developed in 50 (18.6%) of the 268 patients; 23 patients with hypertension (14%) had cough 24.7 +/- 17.1 (SD) weeks after the start of therapy; Twenty-seven patients with CHF (26%) had cough 12.3 +/- 12 (SD) weeks after starting ACE-I therapy (p=0.005).

Spironolactone supplementation at 100 mg/day in patients unresponsive to F or to F and C induced immediate natriuretic responses, except in one patient with a 7- to 70-fold increase in PAC.; (1) The diuretic effectiveness of the IVCS loop is attenuated by aldosterone activation; (2) complete aldosterone suppression with captopril is difficult to achieve due to dose limitation; (3) Spironolactone is preferred because of a synergistic reaction.",0,0

Fosinopril Heart Failure Study Group.,,"Brown, E J; Chew, P H; MacLean, A; Gelperin, K; Ilgenfritz, J P; Blumenthal, M","total of 241 men and women with mild to moderate chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class II [90%] or III) and a mean (+/- SD) left ventricular ejection fraction of 25 +/- 7% participated in a 24-week , prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 10 or 20 mg/day fosinopril, a phosphinic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Patients received concomitant diuretic therapy but no digitalis. Primary endpoints were the mean change in maximum treadmill exercise time and the occurrence of prospectively defined clinical events indicative of worsening heart failure (most severe to least severe): death, withdrawal for worsening heart failure, hospitalization for worsening heart failure, Requirement of additional diuretic or emergency room visit for worsening heart failure, and no event. At the end of the study, exercise time on the treadmill had improved in the fosinopril group compared to the placebo group (+28.4 vs. -13.5 seconds, p=0.047). New York Heart Association functional class was more likely to improve (24% vs 13%) and less likely to worsen (18% vs 32%) (p=0.003) in the fosinopril group at endpoint. More fosinopril-treated patients (66% versus 50%) remained free of clinical events suggestive of worsening heart failure, and fosinopril-treated patients had fewer severe clinical events (p=0.004). Dyspnea, fatigue, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea were more likely to improve and less likely to worsen in this group (p < or = 0.002), and edema showed a trend for improvement (p = 0.088). These clinical benefits did not require concomitant digitalis therapy. Fosinopril was associated with an acceptable safety profile.",1,0

To investigate the role of the renin-angiotensin system in hypertension in the elderly, we assessed the antihypertensive response to enalapril and TCV-116, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, in elderly patients with essential hypertension. A single oral dose of enalapril (10 mg) increased plasma renin activity (PRA) and reduced angiotensin II concentration, while a single oral dose of TCV-116 (4 mg) increased both PRA and angiotensin II levels - Concentration increased. Blood pressure was significantly lowered by these drugs from 4 hours after administration. Basal levels of PRA and angiotensin II decreased with age. However, blood pressure changes induced by TCV-116 or enalapril did not correlate with age. These results suggest that the activity of the plasma renin-angiotensin system decreases with age and that the extrarenal renin-angiotensin system may play a role in hypertension in the elderly.",0,0

However, few studies have been conducted in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). To compare the effects of captopril with more conventional drugs on proteinuria and renal disease progression, we conducted a prospective 18-month study in 42 proteinuric (>500 mg/day) NIDDM and compared to 31 non-diabetic patients with a variety of Kidney disease (NDRD). Twenty-four NIDDM patients were treated with captopril and 18 with conventional drugs. Eighteen NDRD patients received captopril and 13 conventional drugs. Baseline proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were not different between groups. Blood pressure fell equally in all patient groups, regardless of whether they received captopril or conventional medication. However, urinary protein excretion decreased significantly only in NIDDM and NDRD patients treated with captopril. GFR decreased only in patients treated with conventional drugs but not in those treated with captopril. The rate of decrease in GFR in NIDDM patients treated with captopril was significantly lower than in patients treated with conventional drugs. However, in NDRD patients treated with captopril, the rate of decrease in GFR did not differ from that in patients treated with conventional drugs. The reduction in urinary protein excretion was poorly correlated with changes in blood pressure or with changes in renal function and renal hemodynamics. Serum potassium increased significantly in patients treated with captopril.",1,0

After 12 months of treatment, a 12% reduction in 24-hour heart rate was observed in both groups (p<0.05), while heart rate during exercise was reduced only in the metoprolol group. Echocardiographic fractional shortening increased (enalapril: 17% +/- 6% to 21% +/- 7%; metoprolol: 21% +/- 9% to 29% +/- 7%; both p<0.05) , as well as angiographic LVEF (enalapril: 35% +/- 7% to 43% +/- 12%, p = 0.1; metoprolol: 34% +/- 7% to 44% +/- 9%, p < 0.05), while ventricular volumes decreased. Initially, both groups were comparable with regard to all parameters examined. At 12 months, fractional shortening was greater and heart rate at 50 w was lower in the beta-blocker group.

Lesion tissue was examined by bright field microscopy and perilesional tissue was examined by direct immunofluorescence (DIF). The presence of circulating BMZ antibodies was tested by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on monkey esophagus (ME) and saline-cleaved human skin (SS); Histopathological examination revealed subepidermal bullae with variable numbers of inflammatory cells. DIF showed linear IgA at the BMZ; three of the patients also had weak C3 deposition in the BMZ. Serum from five patients was examined by IIF. One patient had circulating IgA-BMZ antibodies with a titre of 1:80 in ME localized to the skin side in SS. All patients were lesion-free within 5 weeks of drug discontinuation.; Drug-induced LABD is a self-limiting outbreak characterized by a linear deposition of IgA without IgG at the BMZ.

We chose to review controlled and uncontrolled studies, comprehensive reviews comparing controlled studies, and case reports where sheer numbers suggested a relationship between mood disorders and nonpsychotropic drugs. Our results suggest an association between reserpine or lipophilic beta-blocker use and depressive symptoms, but no clear evidence for such an association with alpha-methyldopa, clonidine, calcium channel blockers, or ACE inhibitors. Glucocorticoids are associated with both depressive symptoms and mania. Patients taking anabolic steroids should be monitored for signs of mania, anger, depression, and suicidal tendencies. There is no clear evidence that oral contraceptives are associated with depressive symptoms. Our review does not support a close relationship between the use of H2-blockers, anticonvulsants, levodopa, or antiarrhythmics or antibiotics with mood disorders.",0,0

Neurohormonal and left ventricular function data (radionuclide angiography) were collected from 19 patients with symptomatic ischemic heart failure. Measurements were repeated after 4 to 6 weeks of therapy with the dopamine agonist ibopamine (100 mg, 3 times a day) or placebo, administered in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group design. Despite treatment with enalapril, baseline angiotensin II levels (mean 39.4 pg/mL; p<0.01 vs. controls) were significantly elevated, as was plasma norepinephrine (497 +/- 240 pg/mL; p <0.01 vs controls), endothelin-1, atrial natriuretic peptide and arginine vasopressin. In addition, compared to pre-treatment values, left ventricular ejection fraction decreased significantly (-9.1%) in subjects with plasma norepinephrine > or = 600 pg/mL, but not in subjects with lower norepinephrine levels. Plasma norepinephrine decreased from 516 +/- 241 to 391 +/- 208 pg/mL with ibopamine (n=8; p<0.025 vs. placebo), while it increased with placebo.

A dominance of CD8+ T cells in the epidermal infiltrates, a reduction in the number of epidermal OKT6+ dendritic cells (Langerhans cells) and an increased expression of HLA-DR and ICAM-1 on keratinocytes were observed in the acute phase of GVHR-type, but not in either the chronic phase GVHR type or the acute non-GVHR type. These results were similar to previous reports of acute GVH disease (GVHD) skin lesions observed after bone marrow transplantation. Therefore, immunohistochemistry is not useful for the differential diagnosis between acute drug eruptions of the GVHR type and acute cutaneous GVHD. These findings also indicate that similar immune mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of both GVHR-type drug rash and cutaneous GVHD.",0,0

Between June 1991 and July 1993, 19,394 patients from 200 coronary wards in Italy were randomized. Eligible patients presented within 24 h of symptom onset and had no clear indications for or against the study treatments. In a factorial design, patients were randomized to receive oral lisinopril (5 mg loading dose and then 10 mg daily) or an open-label control for 6 weeks, and nitrates (intravenously for the first 24 hours followed by transdermal GTN 10 mg daily) or an open-label control. Complete clinical data and a 6-week follow-up were available for 18,895 (97.4%) randomized patients. Two-dimensional echocardiographic data were available from 14,209 patients. The 6-week all-cause mortality was 6.7%. Lisinopril started within 24 hours of AMI symptoms resulted in significant reductions in all-cause mortality (odds ratio 0.88 [95% CI 0.79-0.99]) and in the composite endpoint of mortality and major ventricular dysfunction ( 0.90 [0.84-0.98]). In the same study, systematic administration of transdermal GTN showed no independent effect on the same endpoints (0.94 [0.84-1.05] and 0.94 [0.87-1.02]). Systematic combined administration of lisinopril and GTN also resulted in significant reductions in all-cause mortality (0.83 [0.70-0.97]) and in the combined endpoint (0.85 [0.76-0.94]). The beneficial effect of lisinopril alone or with GTN was also clear in the predefined high-risk populations (elderly patients and women) for the composite endpoint. These results were obtained in a population heavily exposed to the recommended treatments (thrombolysis 72%, beta-blockade 31% and aspirin 84%); non-protocol treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and nitrates was allowed for certain clinical indications. No excess clinically relevant adverse events were reported in the treated groups.",1,1

After switching the antihypertensive drug to a beta-blocker, the filtration fraction was 0.23 and the urinary protein excretion was 3-4 g/day. Blood pressure control was comparable with each drug.

Historically, the complexity of these disorders has been compounded by inaccuracies in terminology and classification and the presence or absence of an underlying systemic disease. Approaching the literature with consistent diagnostic limitations and accepted terminology can hopefully remove some of the ambiguity. Several case reports and brief communications on cutaneous vasculitis or vasculopathies have appeared in the past year, as well as thoughtful basic scientific reports whose authors have attempted to advance understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. Recent technological advances have resulted in recombinant cytokines, growth factors, and thrombolytics that are used therapeutically for a variety of medical conditions.

The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study showed that the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril improves survival and the development of severe heart failure in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%) but no overt post-infarction heart reduces errors.; In 534 patients in the SAVE study, plasma neurohormone levels were measured a mean of 12 days after the infarction. Patients were then randomized to receive captopril or placebo and were followed for a mean (+/- SD) of 38 +/- 6 months (range 24 to 55). The association between baseline plasma neurohormone activation and subsequent cardiovascular mortality or the development of heart failure was assessed with and without adjustment for other important prognostic factors.; According to a univariate analysis, activation of plasma renin activity and levels of aldosterone, norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic peptide, and arginine vasopressin were associated with subsequent cardiovascular events, while levels of adrenaline and dopamine were not. In multivariate analysis, only plasma renin activity (relative risk 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0 to 2.5) and atrial natriuretic peptide (relative risk 2.2, 95% CI 1, 3 to 3.8) were independently predictive of cardiovascular mortality, while the other neurohormones were not. Only plasma renin activity and aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide, and arginine vasopressin were independent predictors of the composite endpoints of cardiovascular mortality, development of severe heart failure, or recurrent myocardial infarction. Except for cardiovascular mortality at one year, the use of captopril did not significantly alter these relationships. Neurohumoral activation at the time of hospital discharge in postinfarction patients is an independent sign of poor prognosis. This is particularly true for plasma renin activity and atrial natriuretic peptide. Apart from cardiovascular mortality at one year, captopril does not significantly alter these relationships.",0,0
1543,7917078,Side effects of alpha-1 adrenergic blockers.,,"Carruthers, S G","Former non-selective alpha-1 adrenergic blockers such as phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine are now restricted to the pharmacological treatment of alpha-1 adrenergic crises and pheochromocytomas. Prazosin, the first selective alpha-1 blocker approved for the treatment of high blood pressure, was launched in the mid-1970s. In recent years, other alpha-1 blockers such as doxazosin and terazosin have been introduced. The undesirable effects of all members of this class are similar. Most adverse events can be attributed to reversible competitive antagonism of postsynaptic alpha-1-adrenergic receptors in tissues that maintain high alpha-adrenergic sympathetic tone, e.g. B. resistance arteries, capacitive veins and the urinary bladder outflow tract. Orthostatic hypotension with a feeling of intense fainting and occasional syncope may occur soon after the initial dose. Complicating factors are upright posture, intravascular volume depletion, and concomitant use of other antihypertensive drugs, including all other classes of antihypertensive drugs. The problem is reduced or avoided by choosing low starting doses, starting treatment at bedtime, and minimizing other risks. Among the general side effects, asthenia, dizziness, fainting and syncope predominate and occur in 10-20% of patients, resulting in discontinuation of therapy in about half of these patients. Rare side effects include headache, drowsiness, palpitations, urinary incontinence, and priapism. Some patients gain 1 to 2 kg of body weight, which may be associated with secondary hyperaldosteronism. Tolerance to the benefits of alpha-1 blockade appears to develop in patients with congestive heart failure but not in hypertension.",0,0

All antihypertensive drugs reduced mean arterial pressure at baseline equally compared to placebo and did not change vascular resistance in the forearm. In response to sustained handgrip exercise, both quinapril and verapamil, but not atenolol, attenuated the pressor response. However, verapamil was associated with an exaggerated increase in vascular resistance in the forearm during the hand grip, while quinapril did not alter this response compared to placebo. It is concluded that quinapril and verapamil reduce the pressor response during isometric exercise through quantitatively different effects on the vasoconstrictor response in and outside of skeletal muscle.",0,0

The patient was a non-smoker with no respiratory disease. The cough persisted for the duration of therapy with quinapril. One month after switching to fosinopril therapy, the patient reported complete resolution of the cough. She remains cough free to this day.; Cough induced by ACE inhibitors is a commonly documented side effect. It is so severe that 1-10 percent of patients require discontinuation of therapy. Cough is considered a class-related adverse reaction with cross-reactions between ACE inhibitors routinely reported. Switching to another ACE inhibitor or additional therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is currently not recommended. Discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor provides rapid cough relief, although this is not always necessary as most patients experience a cessation or lessening of the cough. We report a case of cough after administration of quinapril that resolved completely after switching to the alternative ACE inhibitor fosinopril in a patient with essential hypertension.; Cough has frequently occurred after administration of ACE inhibitors. The frequency of cough varies and although this complication has been described as a class effect, patients with persistent, severe ACE inhibitor-induced cough may benefit from a trial of fosinopril. This may be particularly useful in patients who are intolerant to an alternative class of antihypertensive drugs.",0,0

Of the 127 patients initially treated with atenolol, 74 met criteria for entry into the 4-week, double-blind phase of the study, which included either benazepril 10 mg twice daily (increased to 20 mg twice daily after 1 week, if necessary) or placebo added to atenolol. At endpoint, 46% of the benazepril group had achieved an excellent or good response (ie, diastolic blood pressure [DBP] < 90 mm Hg or a decrease of > or = 10 mm Hg below baseline), compared to 14% of the placebo group (P<0.01). The mean DBP decrease at endpoint was -5.6 mm Hg in the benazepril group and -3.7 mm Hg in the placebo group. Because six patients in the benazepril group experienced an increase in blood pressure that offset the decrease observed in the responders, the difference in DBP response between the benazepril group and the placebo group was not statistically significant. We conclude that the addition of benazepril to the regimen of patients whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled on atenolol monotherapy can result in additional blood pressure reduction in almost half of the patients.",0,0

The purpose of this study was to determine the predictors of recurrent MI in study participants and to investigate the impact of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on this and other myocardial ischemic events.; The 2231 patients had survived the acute phase of MI (3 to 16 days) and had a radionuclide ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%. Patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with placebo or captopril and followed for a median of 42 months. The impact of captopril on recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiac revascularization procedures, and hospitalization with unstable angina pectoris has been studied. The odds of recurrent myocardial infarction were greater in patients with prior myocardial infarction or functional disability and higher systolic pressure (all P<0.001), but were not affected by left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline. Therapy with captopril reduced the risk of developing recurrent MI by 25% (95%CI 5% to 40%; P=0.015) and the risk of death after recurrent MI by 32% (95%CI 4% to 51%; P= 0.029). Captopril-treated patients were also less likely to require cardiac revascularization procedures (P=0.010), but hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris remained unchanged. When all three of these major coronary ischemic events were considered together, captopril therapy reduced the risk (14% risk reduction; 95% confidence interval, 0% to 26%; P=0.047); In post-MI patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, long-term administration of captopril reduced the recurrence of MI and the need for cardiac revascularization, but did not affect the rate of hospitalizations with a discharge diagnosis of unstable angina. The finding that MI recurrence was independent of left ventricular ejection fraction suggests that captopril may be useful in preventing MI recurrence in patients with better preserved left ventricular function. The need for cardiac revascularization was reduced in patients receiving long-term therapy with captopril, suggesting either an antiischemic effect or the ability of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor to modify the atherosclerotic process in MI survivors.",1,1

Results showed that intravenous captopril can rapidly decrease cardiac preload and afterload, increase cardiac output, inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and decrease plasma catecholamine levels. Symptomatic improvement was rapid after captopril infusion and the infusion was well tolerated by patients with acute or severe heart failure.

Results of the Captopril and Thrombolysis Study (CATS).,,"Kingma, J H; van Gilst, W H; Peels, C H; Dambrink, J H; Verheugt, F W; Wielenga, R P","The study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of acute interventional use of captopril on left ventricular volumes, ventricular arrhythmias and neurohormones during thrombolytic therapy in patients with a first anterior myocardial infarction within 6 hours of symptom onset. Left ventricular dysfunction and prognosis after myocardial infarction can be improved by inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme started after the ischemic phase. Experimental evidence suggests that intervention during thrombolysis may result in even more benefits. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 298 patients with a first anterior myocardial infarction who were eligible for thrombolytic therapy were treated with captopril 6.25 mg or placebo, started immediately after the streptokinase infusion and increased to 25 mg tid been titrated. The effectiveness of captopril in reducing left ventricular volume, ventricular arrhythmias, neurohumoral activation and enzymatic infarct size was measured by an intention-to-treat analysis. During dose titration, mean blood pressure and heart rate were similar in both groups. However, hypotension was reported after the first dose in 18 patients on placebo and 31 patients on captopril (p<0.05). At discharge, 80% of patients were taking study medication. Left ventricular volumes were significantly increased in both groups at 3 months, but tended to be lower in the captopril group; however, the differences were not statistically significant.

Patients were randomly assigned to either pimobendan (mean 10.3 mg day-1, n=119) or enalapril (mean 10.7 mg day-1, n=123) in a double-blind manner for 6 months. Forty-two pimobendan and 37 enalapril patients discontinued treatment, five pimobendan and six enalapril patients due to worsening failure without death, while 13 and eight patients, respectively, died of cardiac disease (ns). Other reasons for discontinuation and adverse events that did not lead to discontinuation were also comparable. Although Holter analysis indicated increased ventricular premature beats in pimobendan patients at 14 days but not at 6 months, these did not result in serious clinical events. NYHA scores improved similarly in both groups, from 2.51 to 2.16 (pimobendan) and from 2.40 to 2.06 (enalapril). The number of patients requiring a change in background therapy or hospitalization did not differ between the two groups. Resting hemodynamic variables were improved by both compounds at 6 months. In contrast, only enalapril improved hemodynamics during exercise and reduced the cardiothoracic ratio.

Results of a 2-year prospective, randomized study.",,"Elving, L D; Wetzels, J F; van Lier, H J; de Nobel, E; Berden, J H","The course of diabetic nephropathy can be positively influenced by maintaining a low blood pressure level. This has been shown in studies with conventional antihypertensive treatment as well as with ACE inhibitors. Whether the latter group of active ingredients is more effective remains to be seen and was the aim of our study. In a prospective randomized study, we compared the effects of ACE inhibition and beta-blockade on delaying the progression of renal function in IDDM patients with early-stage overt diabetic nephropathy. Twenty-nine patients were studied for 2 years, 15 were randomized to treatment with captopril and 14 to atenolol. Blood pressure and urinary albumin and total protein excretion were measured every 6 weeks. GFR was measured every 6 months as 51Cr-EDTA clearance. Baseline values for blood pressure, renal function and albuminuria were identical in both groups. The effect of both drugs on blood pressure was not significantly different. In the captopril-treated patients, the MAP before and after 2 years was 110 +/- 3 (SEM) and 100 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively, and in the atenolol-treated patients 105 +/- 2 versus 101 +/- 2 mm Hg. Both drugs reduced albuminuria and total proteinuria to the same extent.

This may be due to use of different doses of the ACE inhibitor, different kidney diseases and non-standard sodium intake. The efficacy of escalating doses of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril was evaluated in 16 proteinuric patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy with normal renal function and blood pressure maintained on a controlled sodium intake < or = 80 mEqII. The lisinopril doses were 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg administered over 4 weeks. A placebo period of 3 weeks was inserted between each dose increase. Proteinuria decreased stepwise from the control period by 39%, 44%, 61%, and 67% with lisinopril at 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg, respectively. Blood pressure decreased by 22% with lisinopril 5 mg; a similar decrease was observed with dose escalation. Although glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged, mean renal plasma flow increased by 21%, 26%, 24%, and 28%, and filtration fraction increased by 28%. Plasma ACE levels decreased by 33%, 64%, 76%, and 83%. A close correlation was found between an increase in lisinopril dosage and a decrease in urinary protein excretion (r=0.88, p<0.001). The antiproteinuric effect of lisinopril is dose-dependent and may to some extent be attributed to the fall in systemic (and intraglomerular) blood pressure, but is best attributed to modification of glomerular sieve function.",0,0

Since the renin-angiotensin system can be activated in chronic aortic insufficiency, early therapy with enalapril could be beneficial.; Between 1990 and 1993, 76 asymptomatic non-rheumatic patients with mild to severe chronic aortic regurgitation were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind study comparing enalapril with hydralazine. All patients underwent serial noninvasive studies. Seventy patients completed 12 months of follow-up.; At 1 year, patients receiving enalapril had a significant reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indices (124 +/- 15 vs 108 +/- 17 mL/m2, p<0.01; 50 +/- 12 vs 40 +/- 14 ml/m2, p < 0.01) and mass index (131 +/- 16 vs. 113 +/- 19 g/m2, p < 0.01), whereas hydralazine therapy showed no significant changes. Both treatment regimens resulted not only in a significant reduction in mean left ventricular wall loading, but also in a slight increase in loading duration. In contrast to hydralazine therapy, only enalapril therapy achieved a significant inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. In addition, the multiple r2 value from the analysis for end-diastolic volume index using both age and treatment medication variables was 72.1% (p<0.01).; Both treatment regimens decrease the mean wall tension of the left ventricle. Therapy with enalapril achieves significant left ventricular mass regression, a reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indices, and suppression of the renin-angiotensin system. These results suggest that early enalapril decompression therapy has the potential to favorably influence the natural history of chronic aortic regurgitation.",0,0

Twenty-four patients of either sex and between 18 and 70 years of age with essential hypertension were enrolled, 20 met the randomization criteria (with a seated diastolic pressure of 95-115 mmHg), 3 dropped out of the study during the active phase, and one was dropped from the analysis excluded because he was subsequently determined not to have met the randomization criteria at the relevant visit. Predetermined endpoints were blood pressure readings during various periods of outpatient monitoring performed at the end of each placebo or treatment phase.; In the 17 patients who completed the protocol, lisinopril produced greater blood pressure reductions at each time point, although the differences were not all statistically significant.

To date, no study has allowed a true comparison of these drugs in this regard and in terms of their potential to lower circadian blood pressure. Therefore, a total of 86 patients with newly diagnosed arterial hypertension and echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy were randomized to treatment with captopril (n = 43) or nitrendipine (n = 43). Eighteen patients had to be placed on a combination therapy of nitrendipine and captopril during the course of the study in order to effectively control blood pressure. Before and after weeks 6 and 38 of treatment, all patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, M-mode echo assessment of left ventricular mass, and Doppler assessment of left ventricular filling. The 24-hour blood pressure data were smoothed using a Fourier series and then compared to a normotensive reference profile for blood pressure stress and variability. Day and night mean values and office blood pressure were also analyzed. Substance-specific action profiles were obtained by subtracting the smoothed profiles after therapy from the profiles before therapy. After 38 weeks, ambulatory blood pressure had dropped from 152 +/- 11/101 +/- 7 to 137 +/- 13/87 +/- 10 mm Hg on nitrendipine and from 147 +/- 11/99 +/- 6 to 134 +/- 13/89 +/- 9 mm Hg on captopril. The calculated substance-specific profiles for captopril and nitrendipine showed a balanced antihypertensive effect over day and night. The mean percent decrease in left ventricular muscle mass with nitrendipine was 15% and was not significantly different from the 21% decrease with captopril treatment (p<0.001). There is no significant relationship between the reduction in blood pressure and the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. In patients with disorders of left ventricular diastolic function, the early-to-late diastolic left ventricular flow ratio and the isovolumetric relaxation time were improved regardless of the drug used. It is concluded that long-term therapy with captopril and nitrendipine results in comparable degrees of circadian blood pressure reduction and reversal of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy.",0,0

Prior to these 16 weeks, there was a placebo washout period of 2-6 weeks. Blood pressure measurements, euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps, and intravenous glucose tolerance testing (IVGTT) were performed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 16 weeks. Blood lipid status was assessed at baseline and after 16 weeks. Insulin sensitivity index (M/I) increased by 12% during the extended placebo period and subsequently decreased by 12% during treatment with atenolol in this group. A post hoc analysis of covariance suggested that the increase in insulin sensitivity during the first 4 weeks was possibly due to carry-over effects from previous antihypertensive treatment. Fosinopril potentiated glucose loss during the IVGTT at weeks 4 and 16 (k values 1.46 and 1.33 versus 1.10 at baseline), but had no effect on insulin sensitivity. The change in insulin sensitivity and serum triglycerides during treatment with fosinopril was associated with inhibition of serum angiotensin converting enzyme. In conclusion, carry-over effects from previous antihypertensive drugs were indicated in this study, probably due to an insufficient wash-out period in many patients. Therefore, a 4-week placebo washout is advisable in all patients in this type of study.",0,0
1573,7957539,Effects of glycopyrrolate on capsaicin-induced cough in normal subjects treated with captopril.,,"van Wyk, M; Sommers, D K; Snyman, J R","The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and glycopyrrolate inhibition on inhaled capsaicin-induced cough were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study in twelve healthy volunteers. Capsaicin challenge was administered orally before and 2 h after the administration of 75 mg captopril or matched placebo, and 20, 40 and 60 min after administration of 1 mg glycopyrrolate iv to each subject. Captopril and placebo did not change the cough response compared to baseline. However, glycopyrrolate caused a significant increase in threshold sensitivity (D2) from baseline and a significant decrease in overall cough response at 40 and 60 minutes after both captopril and placebo. The D2 baseline and D2-40 min after glycopyrrolate (mean standard deviation) were each 3.2 (1.0); 17.9 (4.2) after placebo and 2.5 (8.5); 23.6 (6.9) after captopril. The elimination of vagal influences implies a weakening of the effects of tachykinins, but not those of prostaglandins. We postulate that tachykinins, like substance P, play a more important role than prostaglandins in capsaicin-induced cough. We conclude that the vagus is important in the capsaicin-induced cough reflex, but since suppression of this reflex was delayed by glycopyrrolate, the relevant receptors are either poorly accessible peripheral receptors or they are located in the central nervous system.",0,0

To determine the origin of urinary ANG(1-8), mean arterial pressure, renal hemodynamics, and urinary arterial, renal venous, and ANG(1-8) concentrations before and after constant intra-arterial infusion of tritiated Angiotensin assay II [3H-ANG(1-8)] at graded doses of 0.5, 2.0, and 2.5 ng/kg/min in 5 non-nephrectomized, anesthetized bitches. Infusion of 3H-ANG-(1-8) had no significant effect on mean arterial pressure, glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, or urine flow rate. The mean concentration of ANG(1-8) in urine was 3.7 fmol/mL. No or only traces of 3H-ANG(1-8) were detected in urine, despite marked increases in renal arterial 3H-ANG(1-8) concentration. These observations suggest that urinary ANG(1-8) was de novo derived from intrarenal generation of angiotensin II. In addition, plasma and urine concentrations of ANG(1-8) were studied in patients with essential hypertension treated with either a diuretic (n = 14) or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 14). Although the plasma ANG(1-8) concentrations responded adequately to the respective therapies, the urinary excretion of ANG(1-8) was not different after both therapies. These data suggest that bladder-derived ANG(1-8) may not be present in sufficient concentrations to accurately assess the activity of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system.",0,0

Seven days after the addition of enalapril, blood pressure was significantly reduced, but there was overt hyperkalemia with a marked increase in BUN and a slight increase in serum creatinine. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone (PA) levels remained low before and during enalapril therapy. Temporary treatment with sodium polystyrene sulfate after stopping enalapril improved hyperkalemia and renal function, but PRA and PA levels were low. PA and its precursor steroids also responded poorly to graded angiotensin II infusion and rapid ACTH injection. Latent hypoaldosteronism probably predisposed these patients to overt hyperkalemia with progressive dehydration and mildly reduced renal function during antihypertensive therapy.",0,0

In the present study, 65 of the original 149 patients with essential hypertension included in the short-term studies were re-examined after 2 to 3 years of treatment. The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp method showed that the significant decrease in insulin sensitivity (p<0.01) induced by treatment with pindolol, propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol, or hydrochlorothiazide at 4 to 6 months persisted after 2 to 3 years of treatment . In addition, the increase in insulin sensitivity (p<0.05) reported for captopril at 6 months was not significantly altered during long-term treatment. Also, the elevated levels of very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (p<0.01) and decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p<0.01) induced by most of the beta-adrenergic blockade without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and hydrochlorothiazide, persisted. Captopril, on the other hand, did not significantly affect lipids during prolonged treatment. In conclusion, the magnitude of the metabolic effects induced by the antihypertensive treatment during the short-term studies was of the same magnitude after long-term treatment over 2 to 3 years and did not differ significantly from the results in the short-term studies.",0,0

During exercise, LV inflation measures did not differ between healthy subjects and hypertensive subjects. In hypertensive patients at rest, lisinopril prolonged isovolumic duration compared to pretreatment, and verapamil had no effect on LV filling; at 50% maximal load compared to before treatment, verapamil shortened time to maximal filling rate and isovolumic duration and increased filling fraction in the first half, but at 70% maximal load verapamil had no effect, while lisinopril improved LV filling Load did not alter either exercise level.

Insulin resistance (IR), described as a common link between these diseases, could contribute to an increase in coronary risk. The euglycemic insulin clamp technique was used to show that different classes of antihypertensive drugs have different effects on IR. The purpose of this multi-centre study was to compare the effects of captopril versus nicardipine on the insulin profile using the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a test that can be performed routinely.

In patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure in NYHA IV, an optional protocol was developed in the CONSENSUS-I study to determine if there were differences in patient characteristics related to the grade of LVD, defined as left ventricular fractional shortening (FS). . A subset of 54 patients from the CONSENSUS-I study was examined using M-mode echocardiography. Patients with FS above the median (14%) were older (74 +/- 7 vs. 68 +/- 7, p<0.01), more often female (48 vs. 15%, p<0.05), and had lower heart rates (77 +/- 15 vs. 95 +/- 17, p<0.01). An analysis of the 2-year follow-up after the end of the study was also performed. In the placebo group, patients with FS > 14% had a significantly better prognosis than patients with FS < 14%. No such difference in survival was seen in the enalapril-treated group. The difference between the original treatment groups remained, although treatment with enalapril was then made available to all surviving patients. In summary, patients with advanced chronic heart failure and less severe LVD have different demographic characteristics than patients with more severe LVD.

In vitro tests for the sensitization of lymphocytes to drugs are considered to be of low sensitivity. We investigated the possibility of detecting lymphocyte drug reactivity in drug-induced hepatitis by analyzing the proliferative responses of lymphocytes to ex vivo drug or metabolite antigens to improve the sensitivity of the in vitro assay. Lymphocyte proliferative responses to five different concentrations of drug and to ex vivo drug antigens (serum collected from normal subjects after drug intake) were analyzed in 25 patients with a clinical diagnosis of drug-induced hepatitis, 27 healthy subjects, and 10 analyzes people who have recently been exposed to the same drugs without experiencing adverse drug reactions. Lymphocyte reactivity to drugs was identified in seven of the 25 patients (28%). The use of sera collected from healthy volunteers after drug intake (ex vivo drug antigens) and the addition of a prostaglandin inhibitor to the cultures allowed detection of lymphocyte sensitization in seven additional cases, increasing the detectability from 28% to 56% .

A comparison of the effects of renin and converting enzyme inhibition should help clarify this question.; Thirty-six patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II or III) were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive either intravenous placebo, the renin inhibitor Remikiren, or the converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat, followed by co-infusion of a second placebo Infusion. the addition of Remikiren to enalaprilat or the addition of enalaprilat to Remikiren. Systemic hemodynamics (Swan total and radial artery catheters) were measured before (rest and submaximal recumbent ergometry), during (rest) and at the end (rest and exercise) of each 45-minute single or combination infusion period. Placebo did not change hemodynamics or renin activity. Potent inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by remikiren and enalaprilat was indicated by increases in immunoreactive plasma renin together with rapid and complete inhibition of renin activity after remikiren and an increase after enalaprilat (all P < or = 0.05). Remikiren and enalaprilat reduced resting blood pressure rapidly and to a similar extent through a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, and these changes significantly correlated with baseline plasma renin activity. Both compounds also decreased pulmonary artery, pulmonary capillary wedge, and right atrial pressures to a similar extent (P<0.05). During exercise, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and right atrial pressure were equally reduced and stroke volume index was increased with remicir and enalaprilat (p<0.05 for both). The combination of converting enzyme with renin inhibition or vice versa did not cause additional hemodynamic changes.; Specific renin inhibition in patients with chronic heart failure results in short-term hemodynamic effects that are almost indistinguishable from those of converting enzyme inhibition. This finding and the lack of additional effects of converting enzyme inhibition in addition to renin inhibition suggest that nonangiotensingic effects of converting enzyme inhibitors do not play a significant role in their short-term hemodynamic effects in patients with chronic heart failure.",0,0

Repeated measurements of the following parameters were performed: blood pressure (mercury sphygmomanometry), left ventricular mass (LVM, echocardiography), cardiac output (aortic cross section and velocity integral), total peripheral resistance (cardiac output and mean blood pressure), aortic and large-artery compliance (pulse wave velocity). , Doppler flow meter) and arterial wave reflections (augmentation index, applanation tonometry). A radioimmunoassay was used to determine plasma renin activity, aldosterone and plasma catecholamine levels. Two-way ANOVA (time treatment) for repeated measures was used for statistical analysis. Perindopril and nitrendipine induced significant and similar decreases in blood pressure, total peripheral resistance (p<0.001), aortic and arterial pulse wave velocities (p<0.001), and arterial wave reflections (p<0.01). At baseline, both groups had LVH mainly due to increased LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) (perindopril, 54.3 +/- 1.4 and nitrendipine, 54.3 +/- 2.4 mm) with a near-normal mean LV wall thickness (perindopril, 11.4 +/- 0.3 and nitrendipine, 11.2 +/- 0.4 mm). A decrease in LVM was observed only in patients receiving perindopril (from 317 +/- 18 to 247 +/- 21 g) (time-treatment interaction, P=0.036). Nitrendipine had no significant effect on LVM (314 +/- 29 vs 286 +/- 32 g). The decrease in LVM observed with perindopril was associated with a decrease in LVEDD (49.9 +/- 1.6 vs. 54.3 +/- 1.4 mm at 12 months) (time-treatment interaction, P=0.04 ) associated, while mean LV wall thickness was unchanged (11.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 10.5 +/- 0.5 mm). Cardiac changes did not correlate with changes in blood pressure or with changes in plasma renin activity or in aldosterone or catecholamine levels.; In ESRD patients with LVH, ACE inhibition lowers LVM independently of its antihypertensive effect and associated changes in arterial hemodynamics. The decrease in LVM was primarily due to a decrease in LV volume, which may have led to chronic volume overload in these patients.",0,0

After such medication, however, unwanted skin reactions such. B. angioneurotic edema, reported. In addition, these drugs have been associated with a persistent dry cough in individuals with no prior history of bronchial hyperreactivity. There is reason to believe that ACE inhibitor-induced cough is due to an irritant inflammatory state in the airways of susceptible individuals and that it may share pathophysiological features with cough, which is considered an early symptom of asthma. All inflammatory responses—wheal and flare responses, airway reactivity, and neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration—were dose-dependently enhanced by ACE inhibitors.

1594,7995312,comparison of lisinopril and nifedipine in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. A multicenter study.,,"Rogstad, B","Lisinopril was compared with slow-release nifedipine in a 16-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study in 102 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 6 and 5 mmHg more with lisinopril than with nifedipine over 12 weeks of monotherapy. After 12 weeks, a greater proportion of patients taking lisinopril were controlled (sitting diastolic blood pressure below 95 mmHg) than those taking nifedipine. As a result, 17% of patients taking lisinopril and 38% of patients taking nifedipine required add-on hydrochlorothiazide therapy. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide resulted in similar response rates in the lisinopril and nifedipine groups (89% and 75%, respectively). The reporting rate of adverse events considered drug-related and the discontinuation rate were similar for both treatments. Cough was reported more frequently with lisinopril and headache, sweating and flushing with nifedipine. We conclude that once-daily titrated doses of lisinopril resulted in better blood pressure control than twice-daily titrated doses of nifedipine.",0,0

In the final clinical trial outcome analysis, we will examine the effects of treatment on the two potentially modifiable risk factors, hypertension and proteinuria, on renal function.",0,0
1596,8005124,Comparison of two methods for determining renal perfusion with and without captopril pretreatment in patient groups with left ventricular dysfunction.,,"Motwani, J G; Fenwick, M K; Struthers, A D","Methods for the effective measurement of renal plasma flow by 125I-orthoiodohippurate elimination and para-aminohippurate clearance with and without captopril pretreatment were compared in 10 patients with chronic heart failure and in 20 patients after transmural myocardial infarction. In the chronic heart failure group, measurements of effective renal plasma flow by the two techniques were highly correlated (r=0.92, p<0.00001), as was the captopril-mediated change in effective renal plasma flow by the two methods (r = 0.85, P = 0.002). However, in absolute terms, para-aminohippurate clearance significantly exceeded 125I-orthoiodohippurate clearance by a mean (+/- SD) of 24.8 +/- 43.7 mL.min-1 (P<0.05), such that only the use of the former technique was significant increase in renal blood flow observed in response to inhibition of the converting enzyme. In the post-myocardial infarction group, the correlations between the two methods were variable and much worse than in the chronic heart failure group (r = 0.54, P = 0.01 and r = 0.74, P = 0.002 on consecutive days). Furthermore, captopril-mediated increases in effective renal plasma flow by the two techniques were not associated (r = -0.19, P = 0.59). In this group, 125I-orthoiodohippurate elimination significantly exceeded para-aminohippurate clearance (P<0.05). This inverse association and the weaker intermethod relationships after infarction compared to patients with chronic heart failure may be related to interference from thrombolytic or aspirin treatments.",0,0
1597,8005126,Can the anaerobic threshold be used as an endpoint for heart failure therapy studies? Lessons learned from a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial. The French study group VO2.,,"Cohen-Solal, A; Aupetit, J F; Gueret, P; Kolsky, H; Zannad, F","The anaerobic threshold (AT), proposed as a non-invasive index of exercise tolerance regardless of patient motivation, is believed to be more reliable than exercise duration in assessing the effect of drug therapy in chronic heart failure (CHF). However, between-observer variation can be more difficult in patients than in normal subjects. In a multicenter study, 85 patients from 10 centers performed a total of 331 maximum bicycle tests (ramp protocols, 10 Watt.min-1) with breath gas analysis by different systems. A central committee reviewed all tests. The percentages of AT determination ranged from 34% to 71% depending on the method used. In addition to the Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) method, which gave the lowest rate of determination: 34%, and the crossing point (at RER = 1), which gave the highest rate, 71%, other methods of determination, such as e.g. B. Carbon, carbon dioxide (42%), minute ventilation (52%), or breath equivalents plotted against time (57%), did not differ in the rate of AT determination. Therefore, AT determination was not reliable even among trained physicians. The crossing point can still be a valuable index from a pragmatic point of view, although it occurs after the actual AT. Peak oxygen uptake should remain the most important endpoint when assessing exercise capacity.",0,0
1598,8005128,Effects of ramipril on the neurohormonal response to exercise in patients with mild or moderate congestive heart failure.,,"Sigurdsson, A; Swedberg, K; Ullman, B","Static measurements of resting plasma neurohormones may not be sufficient to detect changes in cardiovascular control mechanisms in congestive heart failure (CHF). Therefore, it is of interest to study neurohormonal activation under different physiological conditions. Plasma neurohormones were measured in 54 patients on diuretic therapy for mild or moderate CHF. Samples were taken at rest and immediately after maximum cycling effort, before and after 12 weeks of treatment with ramipril or placebo. There was a strong correlation between plasma levels of each hormone before and after exercise. At baseline, there was an inverse correlation between exercise duration and angiotensin II levels after maximal exercise (r = -0.30, P = 0.03), but not at rest. Plasma levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and norepinephrine were increased after maximal exercise compared to rest. Plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity and ANP were reduced by ramipril compared to placebo, both at rest and post-exercise, but levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone, and nordrenalin were not significantly affected. Therefore, exercise consistently activates neurohormonal systems in patients with CHF. Patients with the lowest exercise duration had the highest post-exercise angiotensin II levels. Measurements of plasma neurohormones after maximal exercise offer limited value over measurements at rest.",0,0

Quinapril investigative team.,,"Canter, D; Frank, G J; Knapp, L E; Phelps, M; Quade, M; Texter, M","In this multicenter study of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril hydrochloride (Accupril) in combination with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), a factorial design procedure was used to assess the additive effects of the combination versus monotherapy and the dose-response relationship to characterize each drug in the presence of the other and to determine whether quinapril would attenuate the hypokalemic effect of HCTZ. After a 2-4 week baseline period with placebo, 460 eligible patients with a DBP > or = 100 mmHg and < or = 115 mmHg were randomized to an 8-week double-blind period of one of 16 concurrent treatments: placebo, one of three doses of a quinapril Monotherapy, one of three doses of HCTZ monotherapy, or one of nine possible matching combinations of quinapril and HCTZ. The mean reduction in SBP/DBP while sitting in the valley with combination therapy ranged from 7.8 mmHg/7.2 mmHg to 19.6 mmHg/15.1 mmHg (n=458). The results of the response surface analyzes indicate that the effects of the two drugs were additive and that within the doses studied, the maximum antihypertensive effect of quinapril in combination with HCTZ is achieved at approximately a dose of 26 mg quinapril and 25 mg HCTZ . The degree of attenuation of the hypokalemic effect of HCTZ was directly related to the dose of quinapril. At 40 mg quinapril, dose-dependent HCTZ decreases in serum potassium were not evident and the overall hypokalemic effects were attenuated by quinapril. Thus, the once-daily combination of quinapril and HCTZ provided additive antihypertensive effects of predictable magnitude, and the addition of quinapril attenuated the hypokalemic effect of HCTZ.",0,0
1602,8008712,Site-differentiated gastrointestinal absorption of benazepril hydrochloride in healthy volunteers.,,"Chan, K K; Buch, A; Glazer, R D; John, V A; Barr, W H","The absorption of benazepril HCl (BZPH), an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, into different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract was examined using a bowel intubation technique. Thirteen subjects completed this three-phase, single-dose, sequential, crossover study. The drug (20 mg) was administered as either a 4-hour colonic infusion (COLON) or a small-bowel infusion (SI) in the first two phases and as an oral bolus solution (ORAL) in the third phase, with a 2-week washout between each treatment. Serial plasma and urine samples were collected up to 4 days after dosing. BZPH and its active metabolite benazeprilat (BZPL) were determined using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method. BZPH was rapidly absorbed into the blood stream (Tmax = 0.5 h after ORAL). Absorption was also rapid for SI, with a post-infusion half-life (0.57 hr) nearly identical to that for ORAL (0.59 hr). The rate of absorption after COLON was much slower (lower Cmax and longer Tmax) compared to that after SI, and the apparent half-life (1.7 h) was prolonged. SI delivered 90% whereas COLON delivered 23% of the drug into the systemic circulation compared to ORAL. BZPL was formed rapidly after drug absorption. The metabolite-to-drug AUC ratios were comparable for SI and ORAL (8.9 vs. 9.7), suggesting that the first-pass metabolism of BZPH was neither saturable nor rate-dependent. The metabolite-to-drug AUC ratio was reduced for COLON (5.0), suggesting that the mechanism of absorption of BZPH in the colon may be different than after SI and ORAL. The urinary recovery data were consistent with the plasma data. (SUMMARY REDUCED TO 250 WORDS",0,0

Lying and standing blood pressure was reduced by the active treatment combinations (F=8.8, P=0.0006, analysis of variance). Overall, the fall in blood pressure began within 2 h, with a peak fall at 4 to 6 h and a duration of at least 12 h. However, the combination of converting enzyme inhibitor and alpha-blocker produced a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than the other combinations (P<0.05, analysis of variance). There was moderate reflex tachycardia in the upright position in all treatments (p=0.008). Cardiac autonomic reflexes or left ventricular echocardiographic indices were not affected by the drug combinations. The hemodynamic effect of the combination of enalapril plus prazosin, which alone has little antihypertensive effect in Africans, may reflect an important pharmacodynamic interaction between vascular alpha-1 and angiotensin II receptors. All combinations reduce blood pressure and warrant further studies in Nigerian hypertensive patients. However, the combination of enalapril plus prazosin caused the greatest decrease in blood pressure, and caution should be exercised in their simultaneous use due to the increased hypotension at the first dose.",0,0

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to prevent progressive left ventricular dilatation after MI; The effect of captopril was studied in 58 patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after MI. Patients were randomized to either placebo or captopril (50 mg daily) on Day 7 in a double-blind, parallel study for 6 months. Patients were followed up by ambulatory ECG monitoring and echocardiography. There was a significant increase in VA in the placebo group (P<0.05) in contrast to a significant decrease in the captopril group (P<0.05). As a result, there was a significant difference between the groups at 6 months (P < 0.05). In addition, the number of patients without VA at baseline who presented with it at study completion was 6% in the captopril group versus 38% in the placebo group (p<0.05). Both at baseline and at the end of the study, LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) and LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) were significantly increased in patients with VA (P<0.01). At day 180, both myocardial ischemia and an increase in LVEDVI were independent predictors of VA; however, progressive left ventricular dilatation was limited to the placebo patients with significant increases in LVEDVI compared to the captopril group: 17% versus 0% (p<0.01). In addition, the duration of ambulatory ST-segment depression was significantly longer in this group than in the captopril group (p<0.01). Left ventricular dilatation and myocardial ischemia predict VA in both the acute and chronic phases after MI. In post-MI patients with LV dysfunction, captopril has a beneficial effect on both the number of complex VAs and the number of patients who develop VA during the chronic phase. This is likely to be mediated by effects on both LV remodeling, LV function and myocardial ischemia in patients who are at increased risk of undergoing progressive left ventricular dilatation.",0,0

Seven patients had blood eosinophilia (1.76 +/- 0.2 x 10(9)/L). Bronchoalveolar lavage (performed in seven patients) showed an increased proportion of eosinophils (0.30 +/- 0.07). The Cd4+/CD8+ ratio was determined in four cases and was low in three cases. The transbronchial lung biopsy performed in two patients showed interstitial pneumonitis in both patients and a clear infiltration by eosinophils in one patient. The result was favorable in all patients. Three patients required steroid therapy because of severe symptoms. No re-challenge was attempted. We conclude that minocycline can induce the syndrome of pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophilia, that symptoms can be severe and culminate in transient respiratory failure, and that the disease has a favorable prognosis.",0,0

We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical study in 309 hypertensive women aged 60 to 80 years to evaluate the effects of atenolol, enalapril and isradipine on quality of life over a 22-week period. The patients had mild to moderate hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide was added to treatment when monotherapy was not sufficient to lower blood pressure. At the end of the study, the three drug groups did not differ in the degree of reduction in diastolic blood pressure or in hydrochlorothiazide supplementation. During the 22-week study, linear trend analysis showed no differences between treatment groups in changes from baseline in quality of life measures of well-being, physical status, emotional status, cognitive functioning, and participation in social roles. For each of the 33 physical adverse events over the 22 weeks, we found no overall difference between the atenolol, enalapril and isradipine groups in terms of measuring change in burden versus symptoms, with the exception of enalapril patients in whom Cough burden increased (p=0.001) and worsened atenolol patients whose distress worsened over dry mouth (p=0.014).

They received placebo or the active drug 1 week apart and their blood pressure was measured at 0, 2, 3, 4 and 24 hours. They then switched to the other angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (perindopril 4 mg congruent to enalapril 10 mg) and the double-blind study was repeated. Blood pressure control 2 to 4 h after drug administration was similar for both drugs (perindopril = 150 +/- 2/80 +/- 1; enalapril = 150 +/- 2/81 +/- 1). Twenty-four hours after perindopril administration, blood pressure was lower than with enalapril (perindopril = 154 +/- 3/85 +/- 2; enalapril = 159 +/- 3/89 +/- 2). Enalapril caused a greater decrease than placebo 2 to 4 hours after dosing, while the change with perindopril was not different from placebo. Twenty-four hours after receiving the drug, the blood pressure of the subjects taking perindopril was no different from the peak effect when corrected for placebo and circadian fluctuations, while the blood pressure was higher on enalapril. This study indicates that perindopril has a longer duration of action than enalapril at the doses used and is better suited for once-daily dosing.",0,0

Amlodipine (5 to 10 mg once daily) and enalapril (10 to 40 mg once daily) have been shown to be similarly effective in reducing blood pressure without affecting quality of life parameters. However, 20% of the enalapril group required the addition of hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure control compared to 11% of the amlodipine group (P<0.01). Diastolic blood pressure normalized or decreased by 10 mmHg in 204 (90%) patients on amlodipine and in 190 (85%) patients on enalapril. Adverse reactions were generally mild or of little clinical importance. The most important side effects were class-typical for ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists, namely cough (enalapril) and edema (amlodipine). Tolerability was very good, with only 17 patients (8 amlodipine, 4%; 9 enalapril, 4%) withdrawn from the study due to side effects clearly related to the treatment. Amlodipine monotherapy had a mild beneficial effect on blood lipid levels, and both drugs reduced the calculated 10-year risk of coronary artery disease.

The role and use of ACE inhibitors in patients with chronic systolic ventricular dysfunction established in previous studies has been further clarified. ACE inhibitors are receiving increasing attention, particularly the mechanisms by which they improve mortality, their side effects, and the possibility of further increasing their use by avoiding renal dysfunction and first-dose hypotension. Although most interest has focused on ACE inhibitors, the importance of diuretics and their use in combination with ACE inhibitors is highlighted. Most importantly over the past year was the demonstration of digoxin's effectiveness in preventing cardiac deterioration in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and sinus rhythm. Improved understanding of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, its modification by ACE inhibitors, and the interaction of ACE inhibitors with other drugs provides the basis for further improvement in morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure.",0,0

Long-term follow-up care.,,"Torregrosa, J V; Campistol, J M; Montesinos, M; Rogada, A G; Oppenheimer, F; Andreu, J","Posttransplant erythrocytosis (PTE) is a common complication in allograft recipients with normal renal function. Although the pathogenesis is not fully known, an alteration in the regulation of erythropoietin production by native kidneys or by renal transplant has been implicated as the main cause. Traditional therapies include repeat phlebotomies, bilateral native nephrectomies, and anticoagulant therapy. Recently, theophylline has been proposed as an effective therapy, but without general acceptance. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have also been implicated in the development of anemia in patients with chronic renal failure and dialysis. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the efficacy of captopril in the long-term treatment of PTE. Nineteen kidney transplant recipients affected by severe PTE were enrolled in the study. All patients had their native kidneys and none had renal tumor or hydronephrosis. In all patients, restrictive criteria for PTE were applied and other causes of erythrocytosis were rationally excluded. Captopril was administered at a dose of 25 mg/24 h (12.5 mg twice daily) for 12 months and no change in starting dose was made during follow-up. After 3 months of captopril therapy and throughout the study period, significant reductions in hematocrit (p<0.001), hemoglobin (p<0.001), and erythrocyte count (p<0.001) were achieved in all patients. Erythropoietin levels decreased significantly during the study period, although values were within the normal range of our laboratory. Captopril was well tolerated and only 1 patient had to discontinue the drug because of a dry cough. The present study has shown that captopril at a low dose is a safe and effective therapy for PTE without notable side effects or graft dysfunction. Long-term treatment with captopril for PTE did not result in anemia.",0,0

To determine whether continuing ACEI therapy until the morning of surgery results in an unacceptable reduction in blood pressure upon induction, we studied 51 patients undergoing vascular surgery who were chronically treated for hypertension with either captopril or enalapril.; After randomization, ACEI therapy was either continued until the morning of surgery or terminated at the time of the pre-anaesthetic visit at least 12 h (captopril) or 24 h (enalapril) before surgery. Each patient received a standardized induction of anesthesia. When systolic blood pressure (monitored with a radial artery cannula) decreased to less than 90 mmHg in response to induction, ephedrine was administered.; In patients who received enalapril until the morning of surgery, a significant decrease in plasma converting enzyme activity was noted, and 100% of them required ephedrine after induction. In patients receiving their usual dose of captopril on the morning of surgery, plasma converting enzyme activity was reduced to a lesser extent (compared to patients receiving enalapril). Finally, in those patients in whom ACEI therapy, either enalapril or captopril, was discontinued the evening before surgery, the incidence of induction-induced hypotension was significantly lower when enalapril or captopril therapy was discontinued.; These data suggest that in hypertensive patients chronically treated with ACE inhibitors, maintaining therapy to the day of surgery may increase the likelihood of induction hypotension.",0,0

These data suggest that although all four spirapril doses evaluated were effective in lowering supine and standing blood pressure in patients with mild to severe hypertension, the antihypertensive effect of the 3 mg/day regimen was less than optimal. There were only minor differences in efficacy between doses > or = up to 6 mg/day, possibly due to the variability in blood pressure. Further studies in larger patient numbers are needed to verify these results.",0,0

After a 3 (or 4) week washout period with placebo followed by 6 weeks of active treatment with spirapril at either 3, 6, 12 or 24 mg once daily (or placebo), the DBP decreased by approximately 10 mmHg in the (pooled) patients treated with spirapril compared to approximately 5 mmHg on placebo. There were statistically significant differences between all active treatment groups (except the 24 mg dose group) and placebo, but not between the spirapril groups at the end of the +24 hour dosing interval. Adverse events reported were mostly unrelated to study drug and similar to placebo, with the exception of headache, which was more common with spirapril than with placebo (5.8% vs. 1.7%, respectively). Likewise, the number and severity of changes in laboratory variables did not differ between placebo and spirapril, and none of these changes were dose-related.

1638,8064788,"Clinical pharmacology of converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and diuretics.",,"Sinaiko, A R","The dominant trend in pediatric antihypertensive treatment is toward increasing dependence on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers because of their overall efficacy, low incidence of side effects, and potential specific benefits in patients with renal disease. The common etiological relationship between renal disease and elevated blood pressure is also the reason that diuretic therapy continues to be included in many treatment regimens. A number of ACE inhibitors are available for clinical use, although only captopril has been meaningfully studied in children. The starting doses of captopril are 0.5 mg/kg in children > 6 months and 0.01-0.1 mg/kg in neonates, since there is an apparent increased antihypertensive effect and duration of action in this age group. There are few side effects, and the most important side effect is a reduction in glomerular filtration in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis. The calcium channel blockers reduce the cytosolic calcium concentration and are particularly effective in patients with volume-dependent forms of hypertension. The pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs are similar to drug clearance through hepatic metabolism. Nifedipine in particular has a rapid onset of action and is commonly used to treat hypertensive emergencies. Although used sublingually, the drug's effectiveness relies on absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Few side effects of these drugs have been reported in children. Heart rate and cardiac output increase but return to pre-treatment levels within a few weeks. Like ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers appear to have a positive effect on kidney function.",0,0

Patients started on captopril 50 mg or benazepril 10 mg once daily; If normotonia was not achieved after four weeks of treatment, the doses were increased to 50 mg twice daily and 20 mg once daily, respectively. 11-Oxycorticosteroids and progesterone were measured in men's blood and daily urine at baseline and on days 4 and 15 of drug administration and daily urine aldosterone by radioimmunoassay and compared to these data in 15 healthy volunteers. After eight weeks of treatment, blood pressure normalized in 64% and 56% of patients treated with benazepril and captopril, respectively. In the remaining 14% and 13%, respectively, diastolic blood pressure decreased by 10 mmHg and more, but not below 90 mmHg. Before treatment, the excretion of 11-oxycorticosteroids, progesterone and aldosterone was significantly increased with no change in blood levels.

The frequency of cough varies widely in different series (from 0.2% to 15%), being higher in small studies and lower in retrospective studies with large numbers of patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the true incidence of ACE inhibitor treatment-induced cough in Greek hypertensive patients and to determine several potentially correlated parameters, including gender, duration of therapy, and type and dose of ACE inhibitors. All hypertensive patients treated in our hypertension clinic and treated with ACE inhibitors participated in the study.

The abruptness, severity, and fulminant course of this case of presumably ACE inhibitor-induced pancreatitis are unprecedented in the medical literature. Possible mechanisms underlying the induction of pancreatitis by ACE inhibitors are discussed.

Most nifedipine patients had uncomplicated hypertension, but some (22.57%) had other cardiovascular conditions with or without hypertension. Lisinopril and nifedipine were equally effective in lowering blood pressure. During the study, 1.5% of lisinopril-treated hypertensive patients died compared to 1.8% of nifedipine-treated patients, and 15.1% of lisinopril-treated patients compared to 19.7% of patients in the nifedipine group died. Group discontinued treatment due to side effects. Cough, malaise and fatigue, nausea and vomiting were more common causes of withdrawal from lisinopril than from nifedipine. Conversely, headache, pallor and flushing, edema, and palpitations caused more frequent withdrawal symptoms from nifedipine. Anemia occurred more frequently with nifedipine treatment than with lisinopril. In hypertensive patients, the incidence of first-dose hypotension was similar for both treatments. Serious events occurred in 0.8% and 0.5% of patients receiving lisinopril and nifedipine, respectively. Lisinopril was well tolerated in patients with heart failure: 16 patients (8.88%) died and a 4.44% incidence of serious adverse events was reported, a pattern to be expected in such patients; Dizziness, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, and vomiting were the most common causes of withdrawal; the incidence of hypotension at the first dose was low (2.22%).",0,0

In the acute phase, captopril can scavenge free radicals, attenuate the catecholamine response, induce coronary vasodilation, and increase prostacyclin and bradykinin levels. In the chronic phase, remodeling can be weakened. A large number of controlled clinical studies are currently underway, mainly dealing with the effects of ACE inhibition in the chronic phase. Few studies have focused on the effect of acute intervention with ACE inhibitors on ischemia-reperfusion, ie thrombolysis, in myocardial infarction. In the pilot study on captopril and thrombolysis (CAT pilot study), 3 mg and 6.25 mg captopril were well tolerated as adjunctive therapy to intravenous streptokinase. The decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (36 +/- 11%) after 6.25 mg was comparable to the control group (30 +/- 7%). In addition, norepinephrine levels decreased dose-dependently to 47 +/- 6 and 38 +/- 7% from baseline, respectively. These results prompted a large nationwide acute intervention study of captopril in 300 patients receiving thrombolytic therapy: the Captopril And Thrombolysis Study (CATS). The main hypothesis of CATS assumes a very early effect of converting enzyme inhibition on developing myocardial damage due to ischemia and the consequences of early reperfusion. This is assessed by serial echocardiography, Holter monitoring, and neurohumoral measurements immediately after thrombolysis and during the first year after myocardial infarction. Blinded data show a favorable blood pressure response, with systolic hypotension below 100 mm Hg occurring in only 0.2% of patients.",0,0

Rationale and design of the German multicenter study on the effects of captopril on cardiopulmonary stress parameters after myocardial infarction (ECCE).,,"Kleber, F X; Reindl, I; Wenzel, M; Rodewyk, P; Beil, S; Kosloswki, B; Doering, W; Sabin, G V; Hinzmann, S; Winter, U J","Left ventricular injury from necrosis of myocardial tissue can result in impaired left ventricular function, an increase in left ventricular volume, and eventually the development of heart failure. This sequence has been shown to be blunted in pathophysiology by ACE inhibitors. However, increasing volume may also help restore stroke volume and improve inflation pressure increases. Furthermore, the very early introduction of ACE inhibition in a large study did not improve short-term mortality after myocardial infarction. The aim of the ECCE study is therefore to investigate the early effects of the ACE inhibitor captopril on impairment of exercise capacity, which is considered the first measurable indicator of developing heart failure. The ECCE study is a seven-center, randomized study evaluating the effects of ACE inhibition on oxygen uptake in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design in a group of 204 patients. The sample size was calculated based on a pilot experiment. The study design and first unblinded data from 104 patients are presented. The population consists of predominantly male patients with mostly first myocardial infarction. They were hospitalized within five hours of the chest pains starting. End-diastolic volumes were normal, but ejection fraction was moderately affected. ACE inhibition was started after day one but within 72 hours of the onset of chest pain. After four and twelve weeks, the oxygen uptake was well below the expected values and one third of the patients had a severe impairment of physical performance.",1,1
1667,8125423,The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) Study: Rationale and Perspective.,,"Pfeffer, M A","myocardial infarction increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events (eg, congestive heart failure or another myocardial infarction) among survivors compared to the general population. Left ventricular dysfunction is one of the main risk factors for such adverse events. Although cardiovascular risk reduction has been achieved with the use of aspirin, beta-blockers (and sometimes revascularization and/or serum lipid-lowering drugs), the potential of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to improve outcome for myocardial infarction survivors has only recently been evaluated . The concept that ACE inhibition might be of benefit in these patients stems from animal studies showing that long-term ACE inhibition therapy attenuated left ventricular enlargement. Following clinical confirmation of this initial finding, the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study was designed to determine whether long-term ACE inhibitor therapy would reduce morbidity and mortality in myocardial infarction survivors. The SAVE study found the following risk reductions in captopril vs. placebo recipients: death (all causes) 19% (95% CI, 3 to 35%; p=0.019); cardiovascular death 21% (95% CI, 5 to 35%; p=0.014); Myocardial infarction 25% (95% CI, 5 to 40%; p=0.012). To the list of proven therapies that improve survival after a heart attack, physicians can now add ACE inhibition with captopril for patients with left ventricular dysfunction.

This accounts for 2-3% of all hospitalizations for adverse drug reactions, or about 3% of all jaundice patients. The prognosis of clinically overt drug hepatotoxicity is relatively serious. The clinical picture is essentially non-specific with a very variable latency period from days to years. Drug hepatotoxicity can mimic almost any type of liver disease. A thorough drug history, low threshold for suspicion, and exclusion of other causes of liver disease are important for the detection of drug-induced liver disease. Treatment consists of discontinuation of the suspected drug(s), acetylcysteine during the course of paracetamol (acetaminophen) toxicity, and liver transplantation in selected cases of fulminant hepatic failure. Guidelines for use of selected drugs such as methotrexate and halothane should be followed. Potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be used with caution in alcoholic patients with or without hepatic involvement.

In both cell-bound and excised inside-out configurations, stretching the membrane patch by applying suction to the back of the patch pipette increased the activity of these channels without changing either the unit conductance or the voltage sensitivity of the channel. Stretch activation was repeatedly observed in inside-out patches when both surfaces were bathed with a 0 Ca2+ solution containing 2 or 5 mmol/L EGTA to chelate trace amounts of Ca2+, making stretch activation highly unlikely to be secondary a strain-induced flow of Ca2+. Thus, stretch activation of high-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels in mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells appears to be due to a direct effect of stretch on the channel itself or on an intimately associated membrane-bound entity.",0,0

1678,8137599,Clinical pharmacokinetics of ramipril.,,"Meisel, S; Shamiss, A; Rosenthal, T","Ramipril is a long-acting nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that was introduced to clinical use about a decade ago. Ramipril is a prodrug that undergoes de-esterification in the liver to form ramiprilat, its active metabolite. Ramipril is rapidly distributed to all tissues, with the liver, kidneys and lungs having significantly higher concentrations of the drug than the blood. After absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, ramipril undergoes rapid hydrolysis in the liver. In the therapeutic concentration range, the protein binding of ramipril and ramiprilat is 73 and 56%, respectively. Ramiprilat binds with high affinity to ACE at concentrations similar to the enzyme and slowly equilibrates. Although ramipril is metabolised to both a glucuronate conjugate and a diketopiperazine derivative by hepatic and renal mechanisms, most of the drug is excreted in the urine as ramiprilat and the glucuronate conjugate of ramiprilat. Elimination from the body is characterized by a relatively rapid initial phase with a half-life of 7 hours and a late phase with a half-life of approximately 120 hours. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions between ramipril and other medicinal products have been reported. The drug was generally well tolerated, with the most common side effects being dizziness (3.4%), headache (3.2%), weakness (1.9%), and nausea (1.7%). Ramipril is an effective and well-tolerated drug used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure in all patients, including those with renal or hepatic impairment and the elderly.",0,0

This form of therapy improves survival in combination with digitalis and diuretics. To assess the clinical effect and changes in cardiac dimensions of captopril compared to placebo, we followed 50 patients with severe congestive heart failure for 1 year using echo-Doppler cardiography. After randomization, 25 patients were started with captopril and 25 patients with placebo. At baseline, 6 and 12 months, each patient underwent exercise tolerance testing, radionuclide angiography to estimate left and right ventricular ejection fraction, two-dimensional M-mode echocardiography, and Doppler cardiography to calculate cardiac dimensions and stroke volumes. During follow-up, two patients in the captopril group and four in the placebo group died. Due to clinical deterioration, unblinded treatment with captopril had to be started in nine patients in the placebo group. Treatment with captopril was associated with a more significant improvement in functional class and exercise duration compared to placebo. Forward stroke volume estimated from Doppler echocardiography increased significantly with captopril from 47 +/- 3 to 55 +/- 3 mL and decreased from 49 +/- 5 to 44 +/- 4 mL in placebo-treated patients. This improvement was associated with a trend towards decreased heart rate with captopril. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume tended to increase in the placebo group and did not change in the captopril group. The calculated volume of mitral regurgitation at 6 and 12 months tended to be lower in captopril-treated patients. Thus, in patients with severe congestive heart failure, captopril therapy was shown to be effective and resulted in increased forward stroke volume; it can have a positive effect on cardiac dimensions and mitral regurgitation.",0,0

1683,8141183,Role of bradykinin in anaphylactoid reactions during hemodialysis with AN69 dialyzers.,,"Schaefer, R M; Fink, E; Schaefer, L; Barkhausen, R; Kulzer, P; Heidland, A","In vitro experiments have linked anaphylactoid reactions in patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during dialysis with AN69 membranes to excessive bradykinin formation using this negatively charged dialysis membrane. In the present clinical study, plasma bradykinin levels were monitored during the early phase of dialysis in 10 patients not treated with ACE inhibitors using AN69, cuprophan and polysulfone membranes. Bradykinin was measured by radioimmunoassay after extraction. During this study, one episode of anaphylaxis occurred during dialysis with the AN69 membrane. Blood samples were taken during the first 5 minutes of the adverse reaction and showed a more than 100-fold increase in AN69 dialyzer venous outflow (baseline 40 +/- 3 versus 4,900 +/- 130 fmol/mL at 5 minutes). Although none of the patients received ACE inhibitors, there were 4 other asymptomatic individuals who had a more than two-fold increase in their plasma bradykinin concentrations in the venous outflow of the AN69 dialyzer. When these patients were treated with either cuprophan or polysulfone dialyzers, no significant formation of bradykinin was observed, and no side effects occurred. Taken together, these results indicate that anaphylactoid reactions involving the AN69 membrane are due to bradykinin excess formation, which can occur even in the absence of ACE inhibitors.",0,0

Cases of symptomatic hypotension, particularly on the first day of treatment, have been reported uncommonly. The database we analyzed consisted of 1,177 patients with a mean age of approximately 70 years with NYHA functional class II or III congestive heart failure. These patients were prospectively treated and followed according to a consistent protocol, starting therapy with 2.5 mg enalapril and then measuring blood pressure at hourly intervals for eight hours. 94.6% of patients had no symptomatic hypotension, 4.75% had moderate symptoms (eg, dizziness, headache), and 0.59% had severe symptoms (eg, fainting, collapse, renal failure). For the risk factor analyses, a large number of baseline variables were univariately analyzed to select those that are significant for inclusion in a multivariate stepwise logistic regression. Alternatively, the CART (classification and regression tree) technique was used. Both techniques showed that diastolic blood pressure < or = 70 mmHg was the single most significant risk factor. CART analysis also showed pre-treatment with nitrates and systolic blood pressure < or = 120 mmHg as prognostically relevant.

Patients were visited at the clinic every 2 weeks, where measurements of their sitting and upright blood pressure and heart rate were taken 24 +/- 2 hours after drug administration. Complete blood cell counts with differential cell counts, blood chemistry studies, urinalysis, and electrocardiograms were performed at baseline and during the study. X-rays were taken once at baseline.; Compared to placebo, all drug therapies reduced sitting and standing blood pressure (p<0.001) and had no effect on sitting and standing heart rate.

Because endothelin can contribute to worsening hemodynamics through strong vasoconstrictor and cardiotoxic effects, elevated plasma levels may be associated with an unfavorable prognosis after myocardial infarction.; We tested the hypothesis that plasma endothelin determination in the subacute phase of myocardial infarction is related to subsequent survival and assessed whether plasma endothelin measurements provide additional prognostic information to that obtained from clinical and biochemical variables previously known to be associated with high mortality. Plasma endothelin determination was obtained from 142 patients (mean age +/- SD, 67.8 +/- 10.1 years) on day 3 after documented myocardial infarction and related to 1-year mortality. During the follow-up period, 16 patients died. In a univariate Cox proportional hazards model, day 3 plasma endothelin concentrations were significantly associated with mortality (p<0.0001).

After a four-week run-in period, a six-week intervention study was conducted in which four matched groups of 14 patients taking either captopril or enalapril were assigned to one of four dietary regimens: low-sodium (80 mmol/day) with fish oil (5 g omega-3 -fatty acids per day); normal sodium (150 mmol/day) with fish oil; low sodium with olive oil; regular sodium with olive oil. All subjects were on a low-sodium diet and adjustments in nutrient intakes were made through double-blind administration of sodium and oils in supplemental tablets and capsules. BP fell in all treatment groups during the intervention. However, the reduction in SBP was 4.2 mmHg greater in people taking low sodium than in people taking regular sodium. There were no differences in blood pressure between those taking olive oil and those taking fish oil, but plasma triglycerides and serum thromboxane production were reduced by 27% and 51%, respectively, in the latter. Thus, the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors may be enhanced by sodium restriction alone, but supplementing the diet with fish oil may provide additional cardiovascular benefits.",0,0

The exact mechanism of this effect is uncertain. Signal-averaged electrocardiography was used to assess the presence of late potentials as a marker of sudden cardiac death. We prospectively evaluated the effects of ACE inhibitor therapy on signal-averaged ECGs and the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias in 20 patients with moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction and symptomatic congestive heart failure.; A signal-averaged ECG and a 24-hour Holter monitor were performed immediately before and both 1 week and 6 weeks after the start of captopril treatment. The mean captopril dose after 6 weeks was 38 +/- 31 mg. Patients (19 males and 1 female, mean age 63 +/- 12 years) had a baseline ejection fraction of 22 +/- 7% and a mean functional class of 2.6 +/- 0.5. The cause of congestive heart failure was coronary artery disease in 18 patients, idiopathic cardiomyopathy in one patient, and valvular heart disease in one.; All three signal-averaged ECG time-domain parameters tended to improve over the course of the study (Study 1, 2, 3: QRS duration (ms) = 108 +/- 11, 106 +/- 12, 105 +/- 11 ; duration of signal with low amplitude (ms) = 30 +/- 8, 31 +/- 10, 28 +/- 10; RMS voltage (microV) = 33 +/- 20, 37 +/- 24, 40 +/- 2, respectively) .

1694,8173699,Differential effects of ACE inhibitors and vasodilators on the renal function curve in patients with primary hypertension.,,"Fliser, D; Nowack, R; Wolf, G; Ritz, E","In experimental studies, different effects of antihypertensive drugs on the renal function curve were observed: in SHR, captopril lowered the slope of the renal function curve, ie blood pressure (BP) became salt-sensitive, while hydralazine shifted the curve without changing its slope. To assess whether ACE inhibitors and vasodilators have differential effects on salt sensitivity of BP in humans, we compared the effects of the ACE inhibitor cilazapril and the vasodilator dihydralazine on renal function curves in a randomized, single-blind, crossover prospective study.; Nine patients (1 female, 8 male, mean age 41 +/- 4 years) with mild to moderate primary hypertension were placed on a low-salt (20 mmol/d) and high-salt diet (200 mmol/d). The drugs were randomly administered as low salt + cilazapril, high salt + cilazapril; low salt + dihydralazine, high salt + dihydralazine; or in reverse order.; All antihypertensive interventions reduced blood pressure, but mean post-treatment MAP was significantly (p<0.02) lower with cilazapril at low salt intake (83.6 +/- 2.8 mmHg) than with all of the following: cilazapril at high salt intake (86.4 +/- 2.9 mmHg), dihydralazine at low (91.6 +/- 3.2 mmHg) and high salt intake (90.1 +/- 3.3 mmHg). Probably as a result of sympathetic activation, the mean daily heart rate was higher after dihydralazine with low (72.9 +/- 2.9 b/min) and high salt intake (72.4 +/- 2.8 b/min) than after cilazapril at both salt intakes (68.7 +/- 3.1 and 62.7 +/- 3.2 b/min); The results show that the reduction in blood pressure after acute ACE inhibition is a function of salt intake, ie blood pressure is ""salt-sensitive"" during ACE inhibitor therapy. In contrast, dihydralazine-type vasodilators have similar antihypertensive effects at low and high salt intake. To the extent that the results of this short-term study can be extrapolated to long-term effects, they suggest that intrarenal mechanisms, ie resetting the pressure-natriuresis ratio, are involved in the long-term antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors.",0,0

1698,8178391,Surgery and percutaneous angioplasty in the treatment of renovascular hypertension.,,"Libertino, J A; Beckmann, C F","Unfortunately, no randomized trials have compared PTRA in renovascular hypertension with surgical or medical management. PTRA appears to be a safe and relatively simple procedure with lower complication rates than surgery. The outcome of renal angioplasty depends on the type of stenosis. In all published series, cure rates for fibromuscular disease are significantly higher than for atherosclerotic disease, and PTRA appears to be the procedure of choice in the management of hypertension in patients with fibromuscular disease. The role of renal angioplasty in patients with renovascular hypertension due to atherosclerotic disease is uncertain. Most of the major published series describing the success of angioplasty in patients with atherosclerotic lesions have been very selective, mainly involving patients with focal stenotic lesions. Despite this selectivity, the cure rate was only 19%. In completely unselected patients, atherosclerotic lesions are associated with a very high rate of technical failure, possibly as high as 60%. Based on the available data, focal isolated stenotic lesions of the renal artery due to atherosclerotic disease can be treated with a reasonable success rate. The success rate in patients with bilateral disease, osteostenosis, or total occlusion of the renal arteries appears to be very limited.

In recent years, three large outcome studies of antihypertensive treatment in the elderly with hypertension have shown significant benefits, ie a reduction in the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. All of these studies used beta-blockers and/or diuretics versus placebo. However, newer therapy alternatives have, at least theoretically, many advantages that could lead to a further improvement in the prognosis. The initial Swedish study in elderly patients with hypertension (STOP-Hypertension 1) was conducted in men and women aged 70 to 84 years. STOP-Hypertension 2 evaluates the therapy used in STOP-Hypertension 1 against therapy based on either ACE inhibitors (enalapril and lisinopril) or calcium channel blockers (isradipine and felodipine) using the PROBE design (prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint evaluation). The primary goal will be to assess the effect on cardiovascular mortality. Statistical calculations indicate that it takes 6,600 patients followed over four years (2p<0.05, power 90%) to obtain significance if there is a 25% difference between the new and established therapy.

Due to a longer half-life and greater stability, the N-terminus of the ANF prohormone (N-terminal proANF) may be a better integrator of atrial peptide secretion than ANF itself. After myocardial infarction, elevation of ANF and other neurohormones has been associated with poor prognosis brought. However, when left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and other important clinical variables are included in the multivariate analysis, the independent predictive value of these neurohormones was significantly reduced.; To test the prognostic value of N-terminal proANF after myocardial infarction, its mean plasma concentration was measured 12 days after infarction in 246 patients in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study. N-terminal proANF was a much stronger predictor of survival than ANF itself. Moreover, in the multivariate analysis of cardiovascular mortality and development of heart failure, N-terminal proANF was still a strong and independent predictor in contrast to ANF and other neurohormones, if the model included age, sex, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes, use of thrombolysis, Killip class, location of infarction and LVEF.; Measurement of N-terminal proANF additions is currently used for clinical and objective assessment and provides an important independent predictor of prognosis in terms of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure development.",0,0

At discharge and at the endpoint of 6 months, the radiographic size of the heart was significantly smaller in patients receiving enalapril therapy (n = 28) than in patients not receiving enalapril therapy (n = 24) (p < 0 .03 vs <0.01). However, the left ventricular ejection fraction simultaneously decreased from 50 +/- 10% to 47 +/- 11% in the enalapril-treated patients, while it increased from 48 +/- 13% to 50 +/- 14% in the control patients (S < 0.05 for the difference in changes). The decrease in ejection fraction was most pronounced in the infarcted region of the left ventricle (p<0.01). During hospitalization, plasma N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide was decreased in enalapril-treated patients while it was increased in placebo-treated complicated acute myocardial infarction patients (p<0.05). In the following 6 months the differences remained insignificant. Early administration of enalapril significantly attenuated cardiac enlargement after myocardial infarction and probably improved hemodynamics during the acute phase of complicated infarction. The decrease in ejection fraction during recovery indicates impaired systolic function. The decrease in infarct-related regional ejection fraction suggests that the impairment may be due to poor healing of the infarct scar.",0,0

A diuretic was resumed when new or worsening CHF symptoms and signs appeared. Twelve patients (29%) did not require resumption of diuretic therapy at any time during follow-up, while 29 (71%) resumed diuretic therapy after a median of 15 days (range 2 to 42). Fourteen patients taking lisinopril and 15 taking placebo required diuretics (p=NS).

In contrast, plasma ACTH increased, and the change in ACTH with time differed significantly from decreases in plasma CRH, AVP, or cortisol (P<0.001 for each comparison). No significant differences were observed in plasma CRH, AVP, ACTH, or cortisol responses to placebo, captopril, or enalapril.; Within 6 hours after myocardial infarction, mean plasma CRH, AVP and cortisol levels were very significantly elevated above mean control levels, while ACTH was very significantly decreased. During the 3 days after acute myocardial infarction, plasma CRH, AVP, and cortisol fell substantially, and this pattern was not affected by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. In contrast, plasma ACTH showed a significant increase over time. This suggests that the usual relationships between CRH, AVP and ACTH and between ACTH and cortisol are disrupted in patients hospitalized with myocardial infarction. Maximum AVP levels observed in 12 patients exceeded 50 pmol/L, which may be high enough to impair tissue perfusion. It is postulated that V1-AVP receptor antagonists may have therapeutic application in limiting infarct size.",1,0

It is also less prone to rapid changes resulting from hemodynamic changes. To assess the prognostic significance of ANF(1-98) plasma levels in severe heart failure (NYHA IV), the peptide was measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma samples from patients randomized to receive additional treatment with enalapril (n = 78) or placebo (n = 61) (CONSENSUS study). In the placebo group, there was a positive relationship between mortality at 6 months and baseline ANF(1-98). There was no such association in enalapril-treated patients due to reduced mortality, particularly in patients with high levels of ANF(1-98). For both groups, there was a positive relationship between the increase in ANF(1-98) after 6 weeks of treatment and mortality, while a decrease indicated a favorable prognosis. It is concluded that the magnitude and changes in plasma ANF(1-98) provide information on prognosis and therapeutic effects in relation to mortality in patients with severe heart failure.

Recent animal studies suggest that non-angiotensin (Ang) II related effects of ACE inhibition, such as B. bradykinin accumulation, could play a role. We therefore examined the effects of specific intervention in the renin-angiotensin system with the Ang II receptor antagonist losartan and compared these effects with those obtained with ACE inhibition, as this comparison might clarify the question of whether the effects ACE inhibition Ang are or are not II related. The effects of losartan and enalapril were studied in eleven patients with non-diabetic proteinuria and hypertension.

A captopril-mediated decrease in mean arterial pressure was predicted by 3 factors (r2 = 0.74): the decrease in serum angiotensin II (F ratio = 10.3, p<0.01), the decrease in plasma norepinephrine (F=8, p=0.02) and inversely by mean arterial pressure before treatment (F=5.6, p=0.04), patients with higher baseline values who showed a greater decrease in response to captopril . A captopril-mediated decrease in glomerular filtration rate, determined by radioisotope elimination, was also predicted by 3 factors (r2 = 0.67): a decrease in renal plasma flow (F = 48.6, p<0.01), a low glomerular filtration rate before treatment (F=11.1, p<0.01) and low absolute serum angiotensin II levels after treatment (F=5, p=0.04).",0,0
1719,8205297,Does the combination of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists control hypertension and improve quality of life? The LOMIR-MCT-IL study experience.,,"Amir, M; Cristal, N; Bar-On, D; Loidl, A","The LOMIR-MCT-IL study was designed to investigate the effects of various antihypertensive drugs on quality of life (QoL) in men with mild to moderate hypertension. This report focuses on the subgroup of patients treated with the combination of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril and the calcium channel blocker isradipine. LOMIR-MCT-IL was a double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled, one-year follow-up study in which 368 hypertensive men aged 40 to 65 years were randomly assigned to receive either isradipine, methyldopa, or placebo at three titration levels. If diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remained > 90 mmHg, captopril was added open-label. The QoL assessment introduced a qualitative self-structured subjective measure in addition to pre-structured quantitative measures. Quality of life was assessed at baseline, after 6 months and at the end of the study. Methyldopa normalized DBP in 50% of patients when administered as monotherapy and in a further 34% when captopril was added (84% overall). On placebo, 36% normalized DBP and a further 39% with the addition of captopril (75% overall) and on isradipine 64% normalized the DBP and a further 26% with the addition of captopril (90% overall). The quality of life assessment showed that both the placebo and isradipine+captopril groups showed a significant improvement in semantic memory after antihypertensive treatment. Compared to the other groups, the isradipine+captopril group showed a clear tendency towards lower depression scores, better sleep quality, better subjective assessment of quality of life and a more positive assessment of personal life events.",0,0

The acute effects of the ACE inhibitor spirapril on renal function were studied in 10 patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (serum creatinine of 1.5-2.5 mg/dl). Acute oral administration of spirapril 6 mg resulted in a decrease in inulin clearance (from 53.7 +/- 12.8 to 44.6 +/- 8.8 mL/min; p<0.02; n=5 ) and PAH clearance (from 215 +/- 141.9 to 184 +/- 37.8 mL/min, p < 0.006, n = 5).

1721,8205314,A comparison of isradipine and felodipine in Australian patients with hypertension: focus on ankle edema. The Association of Physicians.,,"Hammond, J J; Cutler, S A","The aim of this study was to compare the tolerability and efficacy of isradipine and felodipine in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. After a 4-week placebo phase, 143 patients participated in a randomized, double-blind, multi-centre study with a duration of 12 weeks. Patients received either isradipine (n=72) or felodipine (n=71) 2.5 mg twice daily. Doubling of this dose and addition of enalapril (2.5 mg once daily) was allowed if DBP was > 90 mmHg at weeks 4 and 8, respectively. Isradipine monotherapy reduced blood pressure from 165/104 +/- 13/6 mmHg at baseline to 149/91 +/- 14/10 mmHg at week 8 (p<0.001), while felodipine alone reduced blood pressure from 171/104 +/- - 17 reduced /6 to 151/92 +/- 19/9 at baseline (p<0.001). After the addition of enalapril in 35% of patients in the isradipine group, blood pressure was further reduced to 144/88 +/- 13/8 mmHg at week 12 (p<0.001). The addition of enalapril to 24% of the felodipine group further reduced blood pressure to 150/92 +/- 19/9 mmHg at week 12 (p<0.001). No differences in blood pressure were found between the two groups during monotherapy. However, the isradipine group had a significantly lower DBP than the felodipine group at the end of the study (p=0.008; 95% CI 0.7 to 6.9 mmHg). Similar cases of headache, flushing, dizziness and tachycardia were reported in both groups. However, the incidence of ankle edema was significantly lower in the isradipine group (p=0.028).

1722,8205743,Response of plasma neuropeptide Y and norepinephrine to dynamic exercise and ramipril treatment in patients with congestive heart failure.,,"Ullman, B; Lindvall, K; Lundberg, J M; Sigurdsson, A; Swedberg, K","Forty-two patients with congestive heart failure were studied to clarify whether plasma levels of neuropeptide-Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) rise in parallel with plasma norepinephrine (NA) during exercise in congestive heart failure (CHF). All patients were studied in a randomized placebo-controlled study of the ACE inhibitor ramipril for 12 weeks to determine whether ACE inhibition alters plasma NPY-LI response to exercise. The patients were treated with diuretics and had stable congestive heart failure (NYHA classes II-III). Plasma NPY-LI was 50 +/- 5 pmol l-1 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) at rest and 60 +/- 6 pmol l-1 at the end of exercise at baseline (P < 0.01 ). The corresponding values for plasma NA were 2.8 +/- 0.2 nmol l-1 and 15.3 +/- 1.2 nmol l-1 (P < 0.001). Prior to ACE inhibition, there was a correlation between high post-exercise NPY-LI and NA levels. After 12 weeks of treatment with ramipril or placebo, there was no difference in plasma NPY-LI and NA at rest or after exercise between the two treatment groups. The maximum training time remained unchanged. It is concluded that plasma NPY-LI and NA were elevated in resting CHF. The additional increase in plasma NPY-LI and NA after exercise was attenuated in CHF compared to healthy subjects. ACE inhibition with ramipril did not change plasma NPY-LI or NA at rest or post-exercise compared to placebo.",0,0

The Multicentre Study Group on Treatment Association with Perindopril.",,"Letellier, P; Overlack, A; Agnes, E; Desche, P","Thiazide diuretics are considered the drug of choice in combination with ACE inhibitors to treat high blood pressure. However, there is a lot of evidence that combining ACE inhibitors with a calcium channel blocker is effective and safe. We compared the safety and efficacy of perindopril 8 mg once daily plus nifedipine SR 10 mg twice daily to perindopril 8 mg once daily plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg once daily in a two-phase, three-month study. After a one-month placebo run-in period, patients whose DBP averaged 95-125 mmHg received perindopril 4 mg once daily in the first open-label period (n=524). After one month, those whose DBP remained >90 mmHg were prescribed perindopril 8 mg once daily for a second month. Among them, those whose DBP were still >90 mmHg entered the second phase in a double-blind manner for one month. 53 patients received HCTZ (BP: 161.2/99.2 +/- 2.0/0.9 mmHg), 57 received nifedipine (BP: 161.4/98.7 +/- 2.2/0.7 mmHg). Five patients dropped out due to side effects, three patients in the perindopril plus nifedipine group and two in the perindopril plus HCTZ group. At one month there was a significant drop in blood pressure (P<0.01) in both groups: perindopril plus HCTZ (-13.9/-11.9 mmHg) and perindopril plus nifedipine (-12.1/-10.8 mmHg) . Heart rate was not significantly changed: perindopril plus HCTZ (-1.30 beats/min), perindopril plus nifedipine (+0.54 beats/min). There was no significant difference between the two combinations for blood pressure reduction and heart rate. The incidence of adverse experiences was similar in both groups.",0,0

Ireland-Netherlands Lisinopril Nifedipine Study Group.,,"Hart, W; Clarke, R J","The efficacy of lisinopril 10-40 mg once daily was compared to that of nifedipine tablets 20-40 mg twice daily in a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study in 127 patients with mild to moderate hypertension for 16 weeks. The groups randomized to lisinopril or nifedipine did not differ significantly on any demographic variables. Analysis of pooled data from all centers showed a significantly greater decrease in supine and standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) with lisinopril than with nifedipine treatment (difference between treatments 7.70 +/- 3.34 mmHg; P= 0.02 and 10.2 +/- 3.30 mmHg; P=0.003 for supine and standing SBP). However, this difference can be explained by the slightly higher mean SBP in the lisinopril treatment groups compared to the nifedipine group at the end of the placebo run-in period. Both treatments reduced supine and standing diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to the same extent, and response rates to the two treatments were similar. The effects of the two drugs on heart rate were indistinguishable. There were six lisinopril and 12 nifedipine-treated patients who were withdrawn during randomized treatment (p=0.22). Nineteen percent of lisinopril patients reported an adverse event compared to 36% of nifedipine patients. The relative risk of an adverse event with lisinopril compared with nifedipine was 0.42 (confidence limits 1.027-0.172), a difference approaching statistical significance (P=0.0573). Lisinopril produced greater reductions in both supine and standing SBP than nifedipine, and both were associated with equivalent reductions in DBP.

Captopril (25 mg), nifedipine (10 mg), and prazosin (2 mg) were prescribed sublingually to determine the efficacy and safety of each drug in the management of hypertensive emergencies during hemodialysis. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured continuously for up to 120 minutes after ingestion. The response rates were 83% for captopril, 90% for nifedipine and 11% for prazosin. The significant blood pressure lowering effects of both sublingual captopril and nifedipine appeared after 10 minutes and lasted up to 120 minutes. The drop in systolic blood pressure occurred earlier with nifedipine than with captopril (10 vs. 15 min). No significant difference in heart rate was detected between them. There were no side effects in the captopril group, but flushing, tachycardia, and headache were observed in 4 patients in the nifedipine group. We concluded that sublingual captopril and nifedipine were effective, but captopril appeared to have fewer side effects than nifedipine and could be an excellent alternative to sublingual nifedipine in the urgent management of hypertensive emergencies on hemodialysis. Prazosin was not recommended because of its low response rate.",0,0
1727,8247909,The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors after acute myocardial infarction.,,"Mehra, I V; Wilson, M D","During and immediately after a myocardial infarction (MI), many interconnected and complex processes reflect the body's attempt to minimize damage and compensate for lost heart function. Although these compensatory responses can lead to short-term recovery of function, their long-term consequences can actually increase morbidity and mortality. Several agents have become well established in the treatment of these patients, while others, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, remain to be fully investigated. The results of two studies examining the role of ACE inhibition after MI appear to provide sufficient data to justify the use of these drugs in specific patient populations. These results are promising, but further investigation is needed to answer the key questions arising from these studies.",0,0

Twelve separate groups were studied: placebo, piretanide 3 mg, piretanide 6 mg, ramipril 2.5 mg, ramipril 5 mg, ramipril 10 mg and their combinations as single daily doses in the morning. Patients were randomized after a 2-week drug-free run-in period; The treatment lasted 6 weeks. A dose-response relationship was found for both drugs compared to placebo; the combination was more effective than either drug alone. Piretanide 6 mg in combination with ramipril 5 mg provided optimal blood pressure reduction. The self-reported side effects of both drugs and their combinations did not exceed those reported for placebo. A surface analysis suggested that piretanide primarily lowered systolic blood pressure, while ramipril was more effective at lowering diastolic blood pressure.

Drugs were administered at the same time of day using a randomized, double-blind protocol. Mean resting blood pressure (+/- SE) was 135 +/- 3 mmHg for placebo administration, 118 +/- 4 for captopril, 110 +/- 4 for nifedipine and 115 +/- 5 for propranolol and increased with exercise to 163 +/- 4, 146 +/- 3, 136 +/- 4, 136 +/- 4.

Only propranolol (-2.3 mL/min/kg) reduced maximal exercise oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption at VAT was reduced by nifedipine and propranolol but not affected by captopril. The effects of blood pressure reduction on exercise capacity in hypertensive patients depend on the drug used and are not related to the magnitude of the blood pressure reduction. The decreased oxygen consumption in VAT observed with nifedipine and propranolol and not with captopril may be due to an excessive downward shift in the relationship between muscle perfusion pressure and oxygen consumption that may occur during exercise.",0,0

Measurements at the end of the four phases included 24-hour blood pressure with the Accutracker, laboratory hemodynamics with the Dinamap and impedance cardiography, baroreflex sensitivity with the neck pneumatic chamber, and plasma samples for neurohumoral and metabolic activity.; Thirteen patients aged 55 years or older (mean +/- SEM 65 +/- 1 year) with mild to moderate hypertension completed the study.; The primary data for analysis in the four study phases included ambulatory blood pressure values, laboratory hemodynamics and baroreflex sensitivity.; Compared to the preceding placebo, lisinopril and nifedipine significantly reduced 24-hour blood pressure. In the laboratory, the effects of both compounds on blood pressure, cardiac output, calculated total systemic resistance, and the stroke volume-pulse pressure relationship, an index of arterial compliance, were similar. Lisinopril was associated with a relative increase in standing systolic blood pressure compared to nifedipine (p<0.05). This coincided with an improved heart rate (RR interval) response to neck pressure, which also reduced transmural carotid pressure, with lisinopril versus nifedipine (p<0.05). Lisinopril and nifedipine were both effective as monotherapy in controlling blood pressure in these elderly patients.

A placebo-controlled three-dose study.,,"Beermann, B; Nyquist, O; HÃ¶glund, C; Jacobsson, K A; NÃ¤slund, U; Jensen-Urstad, M","The aim of the present study was primarily to evaluate the haemodynamic effects of the ACE inhibitor ramipril, which acts via its metabolite ramiprilat. Ramipril 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg and placebo were administered orally to 4 groups of 12 patients with heart failure (NYHA III) in a double-blind, randomised, parallel study. Hemodynamics were monitored for 24 hours, and blood samples were drawn and urine collected for up to 96 hours. In the placebo-treated group, cardiac index (CI) was significantly increased (15.8%) and right atrial pressure decreased (26.6%). Ramipril 1.25 mg had insignificant hemodynamic effects compared to placebo and the 2.5 mg dose had significant effects on some hemodynamic variables. Ramipril 5 mg had marked and persistent effects on pulmonary artery pressure, which fell by 43.7%, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP; -59.1%); Systemic vascular resistance was also reduced by 21%. A significant effect on CI was observed only after 2.5 mg ramipril (+7.4%). The mean maximum degree of ACE inhibition was 73.2, 90.4 and 98.5% after the three doses of ramipril, respectively. Complete inhibition of ACE activity was observed at a mean ramiprilat plasma concentration of 4.7 ng.ml-1. The level of inhibition decreased with a half-life of approximately 75 hours. There was a significant association between the level of ACE inhibition and the change in PCWP, but not with the change in SVR.

1742,8280816,Review article: Drug-induced hepatotoxicity.,,"Lee, W M","The liver is central to the metabolic disposition of virtually all drugs and xenobiotics (foreign substances). For the most part, this process occurs without injury to the liver itself or other organs. Some compounds, such as acetaminophen, CCl4, and the toxin responsible for mushroom poisoning, are toxic themselves or produce metabolites that cause liver damage in a consistent, dose-dependent manner. However, most active ingredients form a sufficiently toxic by-product and only very rarely cause liver damage in special circumstances. The formation of a toxic metabolite within the hepatocyte can result in direct cell damage with disruption of intracellular function or indirect damage through immune-mediated membrane damage. Factors that promote toxin accumulation include genetic enzyme variants allowing greater formation of the harmful metabolite, induction of an isozyme species that produces more than the usual amount of the toxin, disruption of regular (non-toxic) metabolic pathways through substrate competition for the enzyme or depletion of the required detoxifying substrates. The following review article will provide clinical examples of some of these well-known metabolic responses and will discuss some new aspects of drug-induced hepatotoxicity, such as the widespread use of cocaine. The overall message is that as new compounds emerge, new opportunities for drug-induced hepatotoxicity arise. Until extensive experience with new drugs has developed, it is best to maintain a healthy paranoia about the newer drugs - there are very few drugs that are completely safe.",0,0

Therefore, the effects of antihypertensive therapy (6 weeks) with nitrendipine (10–20 mg twice daily) or lisinopril (10–20 mg once daily) on office blood pressure, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and left ventricular function were examined in a randomized , double-blind crossover study in heart transplant patients. Nitrendipine and lisinopril were equally effective in lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the office and in the outpatient setting. After acute sodium challenge (210 mEq/2 h iv), sodium excretion was significantly increased during lisinopril therapy but only slightly increased during nitrendipine treatment, suggesting that inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme may improve sodium retention status in cardiac transplant recipients association with ciclosporin may improve A.",0,0

Patients received fosinopril 10 mg or matching placebo at least 18 hours before PTCA, 20 mg at least 4 hours before PTCA, and 40 mg daily for 6 months. In addition, all patients received aspirin. Coronary angiograms before PTCA and immediately after PTCA and after 6 months were evaluated quantitatively. A total of 509 patients were recruited. The final per-protocol population consisted of 153 fosinopril-treated and 151 placebo-treated patients.

The protective effect of Captopril.,,"St John Sutton, M; Pfeffer, M A; Plappert, T; Rouleau, J L; MoyÃ©, L A; Dagenais, G R; Lamas, G A; Klein, M; Sussex, B; Goldman, S","Enlargement of the left ventricle after myocardial infarction increases the likelihood of an adverse outcome. In an echocardiographic substudy of the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) Trial, we investigated whether captopril would attenuate progressive left ventricular enlargement in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction and, if so, whether this would be associated with an improved clinical outcome. ; Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiograms were performed a mean of 11.1 +/- 3.2 days after the infarction in 512 patients and repeated after 1 year in 420 survivors. Left ventricle size was assessed as left ventricular cavity areas at end-diastole and end-systole, and left ventricular function as percent change in cavity area from end-diastole to end-systole. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo or captopril, and the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events consisting of cardiovascular death, congestive heart failure requiring either hospitalization or open-label angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, and recurrent infarction were assessed over a follow-up period determined from an average of 3.0 +/- 0.6 years. Regardless of treatment assignment, baseline left ventricular systolic area and percent change in area were strong predictors of cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular adverse events. At 1 year, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic areas were greater in the placebo group than in the captopril group (p=0.038 and p=0.015, respectively), and percent change in cavity area was greater in the captopril group (P=0.005 ). Of the 420 1-year survivors with 1-year echo measurements, 111 (26.4%) experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event and these patients had more than three-fold greater increases in left ventricular cavity areas than uncomplicated patients. 69 patients with adverse cardiovascular events were in the placebo group compared to 42 patients in the captopril-treated group (a risk reduction of 35%, P=0.010); Two-dimensional echocardiography provides important and independent prognostic information in post-infarction patients. Left ventricular enlargement and function after infarction are associated with the development of adverse cardiac events. Attenuation of ventricular dilation with captopril in these patients was associated with a reduction in side effects. This study demonstrates the association between captopril's reduction in left ventricular enlargement after infarction and improved clinical outcome.",0,0

Role of angiotensin II in humans.,,"Fisher, N D; Allan, D; Kifor, I; Gaboury, C L; Williams, G H; Moore, T J; Hollenberg, N K","We compared renal vascular responses to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and renin inhibition to assess the impact of angiotensin II (Ang II). We evaluated the renal and endocrine responses to the renin inhibitor enalkiren, to captopril, and to placebo in nine healthy and nine hypertensive men on a 10 mmol sodium diet. Ang II was infused to assess the effects of the agents on the renal and adrenal response to Ang II. The plasma Ang II concentration was suppressed similarly with enalkiren and captopril - an identical degree of blockade was achieved. Although renal plasma flow was stable with placebo, a substantial increase was observed with both enalkiren (+133 +/- 26 mL/min per 1.73 m2) and captopril (+99.4 +/- 22.6). There was remarkable intra-subject agreement between renal plasma flow responses to renin inhibition and converting enzyme inhibition (r=0.90, P<0.004). The vasodilator response to both drugs was inversely correlated with the decrease in renal plasma flow induced by Ang II alone (r=-0.66, p<0.05). Both drugs significantly enhanced the renal vascular response to Ang II (P=0.01), and moreover, the renal vasodilator response to captopril predicted the potentiation of the renal plasma flow response to Ang II after each drug (Enalkiren: r=0 .91 , P<0.001, Captopril: r=0.56, P<0.05). Concordance in the peak renal plasma flow response to the two drugs also occurred in the hypertensive men. Our results indicate that the acute renal response to captopril largely reflects a reduction in Ang II formation.",0,0

1759,8300885,Angiotensin II receptor blockade: an innovative approach to cardiovascular pharmacotherapy.,,"Eberhardt, R T; Kevak, R M; Kang, P M; Frishman, W H","Through the multiple effects of angiotensin II (AII), the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in cardiovascular homeostasis. Angiotensin II acts by binding to specific membrane-bound receptors that are coupled to one of several signal transduction pathways. These AII receptors exhibit heterogeneity represented by AT1 and AT2 receptor subtypes. The AT1 receptor mediates the main cardiovascular action of the RAS. This receptor has been cloned from several species, revealing features consistent with a transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor. Another heterogeneity of the AII receptor is revealed by the cloning of isotypes of the AT1 receptor. Blocking the interaction of AII with its receptor is the most direct site to inhibit the effects of the RAS. Many AII receptor antagonists, including peptide analogs of AII and antibodies directed against AII, possess unfavorable properties that have limited their clinical utility. However, the discovery and advancement of imidazole compounds with AII antagonistic properties and beneficial properties are promising for clinical utility. A leader in this area is the selective AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (formerly known as DuP 753 or MK-954). Losartan has been shown to be a potent antagonist of many AII-induced effects and an effective antihypertensive agent in many animal models of hypertension (HTN). Losartan also showed secondary benefits in preventing stroke, treating congestive heart failure (CHF) and delaying the progression of kidney disease in animal models. Clinical studies confirm losartan's AII antagonist activity and suggest that losartan will be effective in the treatment of essential HTN. AII antagonism likely offers a useful treatment in essential HTN and CHF, conditions in which the RAS is known to play a major role. The utility of AII antagonism may extend beyond that of HTN and CHF, as suggested by the potential utility of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in the treatment or prevention of many other disorders. The main advantage that AII antagonists offer over ACE inhibitors is that they can avoid undesirable side effects associated with bradykinin potentiation with the latter drugs. The AII antagonists help define the role of the RAS in the physiological regulation and pathophysiology of various disease states.",0,0

One of these is the reduced breakdown of kinin, leading to increased production of vasodilatory arachidonic acid metabolites. It has been argued that if ACE inhibition also leads to an increase in the production of the potent vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2, then maneuvers that selectively inhibit thromboxane production without reducing prostaglandins (PG) E2 + PGI2 have the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibition. This double-blind, randomized, crossover study was therefore conducted to determine: (1) whether captopril increases platelet and/or renal thromboxane production; and (2) when low-dose aspirin potentiates the antihypertensive effect of captopril. Patients with mild essential hypertension and no other significant medical problems were studied. In a double-blind, randomized order, patients took captopril alone (25 mg every 12 hours) for 2 weeks and captopril plus aspirin (75 mg/day) for an additional 2 weeks. Active treatment periods were preceded by 2 weeks of single-blind placebo. Fifteen patients with a mean age of 53 years and a mean mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 114 +/- 8 (+/- SD) mmHg were studied. Serum thromboxane B2 was higher (P<0.05) during captopril/placebo treatment (600 +/- 46 (+/- SE) pg/mL) than during the two washout periods combined (420 +/- 57 and 553 +/- 78) and was lowest (P<0.0005) during treatment with captopril/aspirin (302 +/- 36). Treatment with captopril significantly increased urinary excretion of PGE2 (P=0.038). Captopril/placebo significantly decreased MAP (P<0.05) to 105.0 +/- 3.7 mm Hg compared to the washout period. However, the addition of aspirin to captopril did not cause an additional decrease in MAP (105.2 +/- 2.8 mm Hg). It was concluded that treatment with captopril increases the production of platelet thromboxane. However, lowering platelet thromboxane levels with low doses of aspirin may not potentiate the antihypertensive effect of captopril.",0,0

At 16 weeks of age, there was no significant difference in the blood pressures of F1 animals derived from the two crosses. Similarly, in the F2 generation, there was no significant difference in indirect blood pressure values measured at 12, 16, or 20 weeks of age, or in direct systolic and diastolic blood pressure values measured at 25 weeks of age between the animals descended from the two crosses kept on them a normal salt diet. In a second study, cohorts of F2 rats from the two crosses from 16 weeks of age received 1% salt in the drinking water for 10 weeks with indirect blood pressure measurements at weeks 16 (presalt), 18 and 20 weeks and direct blood pressure measurements with 26 weeks. Although these animals had significantly higher blood pressure overall than the animals in the first study at both 20 and 26 weeks, there was again no difference in blood pressure between the animals originating from the two crosses, apart from a slightly significantly higher blood pressure at 18 Weeks animals from crossing 1 (with SHR grandsire).

Blood pressure, blood biochemistry and hematology, plasma vasoactive hormones, urinary volume, electrolytes, and microalbumin were measured at baseline, after a 4-week placebo period, and at intervals during the 8-week drug treatment period. Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram data were also obtained. The perindopril dosage used was 2 mg once daily for 4 weeks, doubling to 4 mg once daily if a blood pressure goal of < or = 160/90 mmHg was not achieved. The dosages of ketanserin were 40 mg twice a day and increased to 80 mg twice a day. Both drugs caused a small but not statistically significant reduction in blood pressure. Although the response rates (decrease in supine systolic blood pressure of > 10 mm Hg) were 54% for perindopril and 45% for ketanserin, the target blood pressure (supine blood pressure 160/90 mm Hg) was only achieved in 21% for perindopril and 20% % of ketanserin recipients.

Eligibility for inclusion in the study required that patients had had HD for at least 4 months, were not taking medications reported to cause inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion or hyponatremia (other than haloperidol), and consented to participate in the study. For each study patient, an age- and sex-matched healthy control was enrolled. Baseline laboratory values were obtained within 48 hours prior to the standard water stress test to screen for abnormalities in electrolytes, renal function and liver function. A 20 ml/kg water challenge test was administered to each patient. Urine volume and osmolality were measured hourly for 4 hours.; A Community of Mental Health (CMH) outpatient psychiatric facility for the patients who get HD and Saint Mary's Health Services for the controls.; Fifteen patients who received HD from the CMH facility and 15 age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled.; Impaired water management was defined as a failure to dilute urine to less than 100 mmol/kg or a failure to excrete more than 65% of an amount of water in 4 hours; Five patients receiving HD were excluded due to protocol refusal or violation. Five out of 10 evaluable patients who received HD had abnormal water handling. Two of these could not reduce their urinary osmolality below 100 mmol/kg, 2 could not excrete more than 65% of the water load and 1 did not meet either criterion. None of the healthy volunteers had abnormal free water handling. The difference between study patients and controls was statistically significant (p=0.0097). Fifty percent of our study patients who received HD had abnormal free water management. This finding, combined with our clinical observations of symptomatic hyponatraemia in other patients receiving the drug, suggests the need to study the incidence of hyponatraemia and develop a useful screening tool to identify patients at risk.

1770,8521771,Nifedipine Gastrointestinal Therapeutic System (GITS). A review of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy in hypertension and angina pectoris.,,"Brogden, R N; McTavish, D","Nifedipine's ""gastrointestinal therapeutic system"" (GITS) is a recently developed formulation that slowly releases the drug into the intestinal tract over a 24-hour period. When administered once daily, it is of similar potency to sustained-release formulations of felodipine, verapamil, and diltiazem and at least as effective as standard formulations of lisinopril and enalapril, as well as propranolol and atenolol, with sustained action in the management of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Replacement of nifedipine-GITS with conventional formulations of nifedipine, diltiazem, or verapamil resulted in adequate control of angina symptoms in patients with stable angina. Nifedipine GITS appears to preserve quality of life and appears to be better tolerated than nifedipine formulations that require twice or three times daily dosing in both elderly and younger patients. In addition, it has minimal effect on lipid and glucose metabolism and reverses left ventricular hypertrophy, making it suitable for the treatment of most patients with mild to moderate hypertension or angina pectoris.",0,0

1773,8522630,Management of hypertensive emergencies and emergencies.,,"Abdelwahab, W; Frishman, W; Landau, A","hypertensive emergency is a condition in which both systolic and diastolic blood pressure are elevated in the presence of acute target organ disease. Hypertensive urinary urgency is a condition in which blood pressure is elevated (diastolic > 120 mmHg) in the absence of acute target organ disease. Hypertensive emergencies are best managed with parenteral drugs and careful intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring. Hydralazine has been used extensively to treat high blood pressure associated with eclampsia and preeclampsia, and its safety has been demonstrated in these patients. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) has the most reliable antihypertensive effect, which begins immediately after administration and ends when the infusion is stopped. Like diazoxide, it should be used with caution in patients with impaired cerebral flow. SNP is the drug of choice for achieving controlled hypotension in patients undergoing neurovascular surgery. Intravenous nitroglycerin is useful in patients prone to myocardial ischemia but should be avoided in patients with increased intracranial pressure. Esmolol is effective in controlling both supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and severe hypertension. Its short onset and duration of action make it useful in the emergency setting, but its use in patients with low cardiac output should be avoided due to its negative inotropic effect. Verapamil should not be used in patients with pre-existing conduction disorders. Nicardipine is a potent arteriolar vasodilator with no significant direct depressant effect on the myocardium. Like other afterload relievers, it should not be used in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Because angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors commonly cause cerebral vasodilation, enalaprilat may be particularly beneficial in patients who are at high risk of developing cerebral hypotensive episodes secondary to impaired cerebral perfusion. Fenoldopam, a selective postsynaptic dopaminergic receptor (DA1), has been shown to be effective in treating severe hypertension, with a lower incidence of side effects than SNP. Hypertension can usually be treated with oral agents. Oral nifedipine, captopril, clonidine, labetalol, prazosin, and nimodipine have all been shown to be effective in these situations.",0,0

Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance for repeated measures. Compared to controls, the onset of the blood pressure lowering effect of enalaprilat was within 15 minutes and lasted over 4 hours (p=0.008). This was mainly due to reduced systemic vascular resistance. Enalaprilat also induced a small decrease in myocardial perfusion pressure. Cardiac output, preload, heart rate and systemic oxygenation were unaffected by enalaprilat; We found intravenous enalaprilat to be effective and safe in reducing postoperative hypertension after neurosurgery as judged by its effects on central hemodynamics and systemic oxygenation.",0,0

In the benazepril/hydrochlorothiazide, 20/25 mg group, the adjusted mean changes in seated diastolic blood pressure at endpoint were statistically significantly greater than those in the monotherapy treatment groups (benazepril, 20 mg, P < or = 0.05; hydrochlorothiazide , 25 mg, P < or = 0.001) alone. All therapies were generally well tolerated. Decreases in mean serum potassium with hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy were reduced or eliminated with combination therapy. Benazepril in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, including a low-dose combination of 5/6.25 mg, is effective in lowering seated diastolic and systolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension.",0,0

Through a psychophysiological study, we evaluated the effects of verapamil (V) and enalapril (E) both as monotherapy and as a combination. Office blood pressure was successfully reduced (<145/90 mmHg) in 11 V (V-Resp) treated patients and 10 E (E-Resp) treated patients. Both drugs were prescribed to 9 patients (V+E) who did not adequately control their blood pressure (N-Resp) with monotherapy. The patients performed three stressors (color word stroop, cold pressor and hand grip). Extracardiovascular and hemodynamic functions were measured during baseline, exercise, and recovery periods. Response was assessed by adding the changes that occurred at each stage of the psychophysiological session. This was done prior to running in and after each change in therapeutic intervention. Emotional arousal (phrontalis muscle contraction, skin conductance, peripheral temperature) was reduced with normal blood pressure. No change in BP reactivity was found. The HF response decreased in V-Resp and cardiac output increased in E-Resp, while the vascular response was retarded in E-Resp and V-Resp. This was also reduced in N-Resp when they adopted V+E and normalized their arterial pressure. The findings indicate that sympathetic reactivity can be modified by therapy. In particular, verapamil suppressed the cardiac stress response without decreasing cardiac output and was advantageously associated with enalapril to control the psychophysiological response in patients with more resistant hypertension.",0,0

Group C included 10 healthy volunteers as controls. Changes in basal MA during exercise and after exercise were examined in all three groups. Normotensive patients without metabolic disorders, normal renal function and without proteinuria were subjected to an ergometric test up to 600 kg. This test was repeated for 60 days after administration of 20 mg enalapril in a single daily dose. Body weight, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, creatinine and creatinine clearance were determined and showed no significant differences between the groups or with the treatment. Microalbuminuria was examined in the three groups with and without administration of enalapril during the 2 months of the study. The determinations were performed under rest, exercise and post-exercise conditions. The mean baseline MA values +/- SEM were as follows: at rest 5.22 +/- 0.49, 58.36 +/- 13.24, and 4.73 +/- 0.45 micrograms/min for the groups A, B and C, respectively; with exercise 15.19 +/- 4.43, 74.70 +/- 14.89, and 16.76 +/- 4.62 micrograms/min for Groups A, B, and C, respectively; and post-exercise 32.04 +/- 6.64, 253.15 +/- 63.88, and 9.23 +/- 3.25 micrograms/min, respectively.

The authors assessed autonomic system activity by power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability in 21 elderly hypertensive men with and without angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease and compared the results to an age-matched control group. In the analysis, an autoregressive algorithm was used to determine the power spectrum from an electrocardiographic recording of 512 consecutive RR intervals. The autonomic nervous system induces two distinct sinusoids: a low-frequency signal attributable to sympathetic activity and a high-frequency vagal response. In hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease, the authors also examined sympathetic activation after double-blind, placebo-controlled administration of metoprolol (100 mg/day), followed by amlodipine (10 mg/day), quinapril (20 mg/day), and amlodipine (5th dose). mg/day) plus quinapril (10 mg/day).",0,0

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the course of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in hypertensive NIDDM patients during antihypertensive therapy. In addition, we compared the effects of ACE inhibitors (Cilazapril, Inibace, Roche, Milan, Italy) and Ca(2+) channel blockers (Amlodipine, Norvasc, Pfizer, Rome, Italy). Of the hypertensive NIDDM patients attending the outpatient departments of the Departments of Internal Medicine at the University of Padova and Sassari, 44 participated in the present study. Of these patients, 26 were normoalbuminuric and 18 were microalbuminuric. They were randomly treated with either cilazapril or amlodipine. The aim of the antihypertensive treatment was a value < 140 mmHg for the systolic and 85 mmHg for the diastolic blood pressure (BP). Microalbuminuria was defined as an albumin excretion rate (AER) between 20 and 200 micrograms/min. GFR was measured by plasma clearance of 51Cr-labelled EDTA at baseline and every 6-12 months during a 3-year follow-up interval. A significant decrease in the values of GFR, AER and systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed in normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients during antihypertensive therapy. The GFR decrease in the overall population of NIDDM patients was significant and inversely proportional to the decrease in mean BP (diastolic + 1/3 pulse pressure) (r = -0.80, P < 0.0001), but not to that of HbA1c , triglycerides and BMI. The GFR decrease (mean +/- SE) per year in the normoalbuminuric patient was 2.03 +/- 0.66 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2 (95% CI 0.92-3.17 ) during cilazapril and 2.01 +/- 0.71 mL. min-1 x 1.73 m-2 (95% CI 0.82-3.11) during amlodipine therapy. The GFR drop per year in the microalbuminuric patient was 2.15 +/- 0.69 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2 (95% CI 0.86-3.89) during cilazapril and 2, 33 +/- 0.83mL.min-1 x 1.73m-2. 2 per year (95% CI 1.03-3.67) during amlodipine therapy. Cilazapril and amlodipine decreased the AER in normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients to a similar extent. Regarding other clinical and biochemical features, no significant changes were observed between the two antihypertensive therapies and in particular HbA1c, BMI, triglycerides and cholesterol plasma levels. These results support the principle that arterial hypertension plays a central role in contributing to renal damage in NIDDM even when AER is normal. However, the degree of BP control, with both cilazapril and amlodipine, can successfully delay the increase in GFR decline in hypertensive NIDDM patients with or without incipient nephropathy.",0,0

Regardless of the results of the captopril test, selective renal angiography was performed in all patients. Twenty patients had unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS), which corresponds to a prevalence of 43%. After placebo and after captopril, there were no significant changes (absolute or proportional) in blood pressure values between patients with essential hypertension or RAS, neither for all measurements nor when only the drop in blood pressure was taken into account. The recipient's operator characteristic curves of both baseline and post-captopril peripheral renin levels indicate that the captopril test does not adequately discriminate between patients with essential hypertension and RAS. Therefore, we advise against using the captopril test as a screening test for RAS in hypertensive patients who already have a high clinical suspicion of RAS.",0,0

After initial diet therapy, 4209 asymptomatic patients who remained hyperglycemic (fasting plasma glucose levels 6.0 to 15.0 mmol/L) were assigned to either a conventional therapy strategy, mainly diet alone, or an intensive therapy strategy aiming at fasting plasma glucose -Levels less than 6.0 mmol/L, associated with first-line therapy with sulfonylurea or insulin (which increases insulin delivery) or metformin (which increases insulin sensitivity); All three types of pharmacological therapy in the intensive care group - sulfonylurea, insulin and metformin - had similar efficacy in reducing fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. Over a 9-year period, patients assigned to intensive care therapy with sulfonylurea or insulin had lower fasting plasma glucose levels (median 7.3 and 9.0 mmol/L, respectively) than patients assigned to conventional therapy. Regardless of the assigned therapy, however, fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels increased, and maintaining near-normal blood glucose levels was generally not possible. Even insulin therapy did not achieve the therapeutic goal of near-normal glycemia because of the difficulty in managing marked hyperglycemia and the risk of hypoglycaemic episodes. Nine years after diagnosis of diabetes, 29% of patients had a diabetes-related clinical endpoint, 20% had a macrovascular complication, and 9% had a microvascular complication.; A report is published in 1998 after a median time from randomization of 11 years (range 6 to 20 years) with a power of 81% at a significance level of 1% to determine whether the improvement in glucose control achieved causes a 15% decrease or Increase in the incidence of major complications and whether a particular therapy is beneficial or disadvantageous.",0,0

The primary endpoint of the 6-month follow-up was the composite endpoint of mortality and severe left ventricular dysfunction.; The assumption was that the early benefits of remodeling processes can be maintained over a longer period of time even without treatment.; A total of 19,394 patients with acute myocardial infarction were randomized within 24 hours of symptom onset to receive 6 weeks of oral lisinopril or an open-label control and, in a 2 x 2 factorial design, glyceryl trinitrate or an open-label control. Randomized treatments were terminated after 6 weeks in the absence of specific indications and patients were followed up for 6 months.; At 6 months, 18.1% of patients randomized to lisinopril died or developed severe ventricular dysfunction versus 19.3% of patients not randomized to lisinopril (2p=0.03). No difference was found between patients with and without glyceryl trinitrate therapy (18.4% vs. 18.9%, 2p = 0.39); Although systematic administration of glyceryl trinitrate, started early and continued beyond 6 weeks after acute myocardial infarction, provides no evidence of benefit, early treatment with lisinopril appears to improve prognosis.

Patients received either perindopril 4 mg or amiloride 2.5/25 mg + hydrochlorothiazide once daily. Patients were then followed for a 3-month single-blind placebo run-out period.; After 6 months of treatment, systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by perindopril (supine by 11%, sitting by 10%) and by amiloride + hydrochlorothiazide (supine by 8%, sitting by 12%). Diastolic blood pressure was also significantly reduced by perindopril (supine by 8%, sitting by 11%) and by amiloride + hydrochlorothiazide (supine by 4%, sitting by 9%). Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly during treatment with perindopril (by 9%) and with amiloride + hydrochlorothiazide (by 6%). Cardiac index increased with perindopril (by 6%) due to increased stroke index (by 5%), but amiloride + hydrochlorothiazide did not alter cardiac function. The systemic vascular resistance index decreased significantly more with perindopril (by 14%) than with amiloride + hydrochlorothiazide (by 8%). The distensibility of the common carotid artery was significantly increased by perindopril (by 16%), but not changed by amiloride + hydrochlorothiazide (1% difference). The difference between perindopril and amiloride + hydrochlorothiazide for carotid compliance was statistically significant. Common carotid artery compliance tended to be increased more (by 7%) with perindopril than with amiloride + hydrochlorothiazide, resulting in a 5% decrease in carotid compliance. After discontinuation of therapy for both drugs, all treatment-induced changes reversed to pre-treatment values within 7 weeks.; The flexibility of the elastic common carotid artery was increased by perindopril but not by amiloride + hydrochlorothiazide. The characteristics of the large arteries of the muscular arteries and systemic vascular resistance improved with both drugs, but in general the changes were more pronounced with perindopril than with amiloride + hydrochlorothiazide. The present results indicate a more pronounced effect of perindopril on both the macro and microcirculatory levels, which will consequently result in a greater decrease in cardiac afterload.

Blood pressure was measured by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring.; Enalapril and nifedipine-GITS significantly reduced blood pressure compared to placebo. Aspirin did not alter the antihypertensive effects of either drug. Indomethacin attenuated (by 45%) the antihypertensive effect of enalapril over the 24-hour study period, but did not impair the effect of nifedipine. In addition, indomethacin significantly reduced fractionated sodium excretion and plasma levels of prostaglandins when added to either enalapril or nifedipine treatment.; Vasodilator prostaglandins are likely involved in the antihypertensive effects of enalapril but not nifedipine, and this interaction appears to be independent of an indomethacin-induced reduction in renal sodium excretion.

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are commonly used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. While generally well tolerated, a dry cough may develop, occasionally requiring discontinuation of therapy. The reported prevalence of cough with ACE inhibitor therapy has ranged from 0.2 to 25%, depending on the methods of data collection, analysis and symptom reporting. 2. To assess the prevalence of cough in Chinese patients receiving ACE inhibitors, interviews were conducted in Hong Kong with 191 patients taking captopril or enalapril therapy for hypertension or heart failure and 382 patients matched by sex and age an alternative received drugs that excluded an ACE inhibitor (controls). Patients and controls were interviewed in a blinded manner by the same interviewer using a common adverse event questionnaire. 3. Persistent cough was resolved in 44% of patients taking an ACE inhibitor (46% of patients taking captopril and 41.8% of patients taking enalapril) and 11.1% of controls (p < 0.001) reported. The prevalence of other side effects was similar, with no significant difference between the two treatment groups. Cough complication was not significantly associated with age, gender, underlying disease, medication dose, or smoking status. 4.

A 7-year follow-up study.,,"Ravid, M; Lang, R; Rachmani, R; Lishner, M","Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in industrialized countries. Duration of diabetes, blood pressure levels, and metabolic status are the major determinants of the course of nephropathy, and microalbuminuria is the hallmark of its onset. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors provide important renoprotective protection in hypertensive and normotensive patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Our study extends previous observations regarding the duration and effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on advanced nephropathy.; 7-year double-blind (first phase) and open-label (second phase) randomized controlled study. 94 normotensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus whose serum creatinine level was below 123.76 µmol/l (1.4 mg/dl) and who exhibited microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg/24 h) received enalapril maleate 10 mg/d or Placebo for 5 years. They were followed up openly for a further two years and given the choice of receiving enalapril or no treatment.; Albuminuria remained stable for 7 years in patients treated with enalapril. In the untreated group, at 5 years there was an increase from (mean +/- SD) 123 +/- 58 to 310 +/- 167 mg/24 h and a further increase to (mean +/- SD) 393 +/- - 223 mg/24 h occurred after 7 years. The reciprocal creatinine remained unchanged in the treated patients for 7 years; in untreated patients, the mean decrease was 13% at 5 years and 16% at 7 years.

LV systolic function remained unchanged, while E/A increased significantly (P<0.001) in two groups at 8 weeks. In conclusion, antihypertensive treatment with perindopril and metoprolol induced a significant regression in LVH associated with an improvement in LV diastolic performance. Perindopril was more effective in reversing LVH compared to metoprolol.",0,0

Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Drugs.,,"Materson, B J; Reda, D J; Cushman, W C; Henderson, W G","We randomized ambulatory males with diastolic blood pressure (BP) 95-109 mmHg without antihypertensive medication to single-drug treatment with either hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-50 mg/day, atenolol 25-100 mg/day, captopril 25-100 mg/day, Clonidine 0.2-0.6 mg/day, diltiazem-SR 120-360 mg/day, prazosin 4-20 mg/day or placebo in a prospective double-blind study. The assigned drug has been titrated to a target BP of < 90 mm Hg. Patients who did not achieve blood pressure goal were randomized to an alternative single agent. Non-responders to the second drug received the first drug in combination with the second. Of the 102 non-responders to both drugs eligible for the combination, 59 (57.8%) responded. The combination pairs containing a diuretic achieved target diastolic blood pressure in 69% and <140 mmHg systolic in 77%, compared with 51% and 46% for the combinations without a diuretic, respectively (p=0.067; p=0.002). Six of the eight discontinuations due to adverse drug reactions were in combinations containing prazosin; three of these six were hypotensive reactions. We conclude that two single drugs with insufficient efficacy in controlling blood pressure individually have a high probability of achieving target blood pressure when combined, particularly when the combination contains a diuretic.",0,0

During the median follow-up of 40 months, 28.1% of subjects randomized to enalapril reported adverse reactions compared to 16.0% in the placebo group (p<0.0001). Enalapril use was associated with a higher rate of symptoms related to hypotension (14.8% vs 7.1%, p<0.0001), azotaemia (3.8% vs 1.6%, p<0 .0001), cough (5.0% vs. 2.0%, p<0.0001). , fatigue (5.8% vs. 3.5%, p<0.0001), hyperkalemia (1.2% vs. 0.4%, p=0.0002), and angioedema (0.4% vs. 0 .1%, p<0.05). Adverse events led to discontinuation of blinded therapy in 15.2% of the enalapril group compared to 8.6% in the placebo group (p<0.0001).

1806,8582461,Chronopharmacology of enalapril in hypertensive patients.,,"Sunaga, K; Fujimura, A; Shiga, T; Ebihara, A","The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, are reported to vary with the timing of administration. The present study was conducted to investigate whether the effects of enalapril on plasma bradykinin (BK), substance P and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which are likely to be involved in the mechanism of enalapril-induced cough, are also influenced by time could of administration. Enalapril 5 mg or placebo was administered orally to 12 patients with essential hypertension at 10:00 am (day trial) or 10:00 pm (night trial). The serum concentrations of the total drug (enalapril + enalaprilat, its active metabolite) during the day and night studies did not differ significantly at any time point. However, enalaprilat in the serum tended to be higher in the day experiment and its maximum concentration higher than in the night experiment. Blood pressure was reduced at 10 p.m. but not at 10 a.m. 24 hours after enalapril administration. Plasma BK tended to rise after enalapril administration at 10:00 but not at 22:00. Remarkable increases in plasma BK were observed in two patients in the day trial, and one of them also complained of coughing. However, no such increase in plasma BK or subsequent adverse effect was observed in the night trial. The plasma substance P and PGE2 did not change significantly after the administration of enalapril, neither in the day nor in the night test. The results suggest that the response of BK to enalapril is influenced by the timing of administration. In patients who complain of coughing during the day during treatment with enalapril, this side effect may be reduced or eliminated by switching to nocturnal dosing.",0,0

Each subject demonstrated supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < or = 90 mm Hg following prospective ACE inhibitor monotherapy, with supine DBP returning to 95-110 mm Hg 4 weeks after ACE inhibitor discontinuation. These subjects were then admitted to an inpatient unit for six 24-hour periods; an initial acclimatization period, followed by five single doses of IV captopril (1.25, 12.5, and 125 mg) or placebo administered as a 20-minute infusion and oral captopril (25 mg) or placebo in a double-blind, double-dummy crossover -Study. Each dose was separated by 48 hours. All 20 patients completed the study with no clinically significant side effects. Captopril 125 mg IV, 12.5 mg IV, and 25 mg oral doses produced similar blood pressure reductions over the 12-hour post-dose interval and were more effective in reducing blood pressure than intravenous captopril 1.25 mg or placebo. The 125 mg intravenous dose of captopril was no more effective overall in lowering blood pressure than the 12.5 mg iv and 25 mg oral doses and was associated with a greater incidence of side effects.

One hundred seventy-two hypertensive men and women aged 65 to 80 years with seated DBP between 95 and 114 mm Hg were studied. The study was a 2-year, multicentre (12 centres), open-label protocol with moexipril monotherapy or combination therapy (with hydrochlorothiazide). Blood pressure, pulse rate, weight, side effects, and laboratory studies were evaluated after taking moexipril 7.5 or 15 mg once daily or 7.5 or 15 mg daily in combination with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg if the seated DBP on moexipril was > or = 90 mm Hg remained monotherapy. The primary measure of effectiveness was a change from baseline in seated DBP. Secondary outcome parameters included changes in seated DBP, pulse rate, laboratory parameters, and adverse events. After 1 year of therapy in 135 patients, blood pressure fell by 16/14 mm Hg in those receiving moexipril monotherapy and by 27/17 mm Hg in those receiving combination therapy compared to baseline (p< 0.001 for both). After 2 years of treatment, reductions were similar in 120 patients. Nineteen patients (11%) were withdrawn early from the study due to inadequate therapeutic response and 28 (16%) due to adverse experiences. No significant changes in pulse rate or postural reductions in blood pressure occurred under either moexipril monotherapy or combination treatment. Three adverse reactions occurred with a frequency greater than 2% that were possibly or probably related to moexipril or the combination therapy: hypotension (2%), dizziness (6%) and increased cough (12%). There were no clinically relevant group mean changes from baseline laboratory values in the treatment groups. Taken together, these long-term data show that moexipril, either alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, has a long-term antihypertensive effect and is generally well tolerated in elderly patients with hypertension.",0,0

Untreated SHR (n=16) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (n=17) of the same age served as controls. The experiments were carried out after 40 weeks.; Discontinuation of captopril treatment resulted in a rapid increase in SBP to levels close to untreated SHR in the low-dose group, while a persistently lower SBP was maintained in the high-dose group. Both doses of captopril treatment completely prevented the wall hypertrophy of either the arteriolar resistance vessels or the muscular vessels. Captopril reduced the ratio of left ventricular mass to body weight in a dose-dependent manner. High-dose captopril improved resting and exercise systolic and diastolic function. Thoracic angiotensin converting enzyme levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with captopril. The perfusion pressure response curves to incremental doses of phenylephrine shifted to the right in both captopril treatment groups compared to those of the control SHR. Addition of L-NAME and L-arginine to the perfusate enhanced or attenuated vasoconstrictor activity in all rats, while high-dose captopril completely restored abnormal hypersensitivity to L-NAME and caused less attenuation in response to L-arginine in the control SHR .; The sustained lower blood pressure caused by early treatment with captopril was mainly attributed to its sustained normalization of resistance vessel structure and function, which may be mediated in part by the improvement in endothelial cell function. The sustained reduction in angiotensin converting enzyme activity in the blood vessel wall of attenuated left ventricular hypertrophy and improvement in cardiac systolic and diastolic function may also contribute to the sustained antihypertensive effect.",0,0

Failure was defined as failure to meet one or more of these criteria. Equivalence was concluded when the 95% confidence interval for the success rates between two groups differed by less than +/- 10%.

In 83 and 79 patients, respectively, lisinopril and slow-release nifedipine produced similar blood pressure reductions (systolic/diastolic: -16/-13 mmHg supine and -14/-11 mmHg standing after lisinopril; -15/-12 mmHg supine) . and -14/-11 mmHg nifedipine standing). Fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and plasma lipids appeared unaffected by either agent. In addition, 28% of patients on lisinopril and 30% of patients on nifedipine had microalbuminuria. Both drugs induced a decrease in albumin excretion rate (AER). The geometric mean x:tolerance factor of reduction in AER was greater, although not significantly, in the 23 microalbuminuric patients receiving lisinopril (-10.0 x:1.3 micrograms/min) than in the 26 patients receiving nifedipine (-0.9 x 1.2 micrograms/min). In addition, lisinopril appeared to be better tolerated than nifedipine in our study population. Microalbuminuria is an important risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in non-insulin-dependent diabetics and in the general population. To what extent a reduction in VRE in diabetics could bring about an improvement is currently unknown. Finally, both lisinopril and nifedipine showed similar antihypertensive effects in these patients that were not associated with significant differences in plasma glucose, insulin, or lipid concentrations.

The study consisted of a 4-week placebo washout period and a 12-week active treatment period. Patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension were considered for participation in the study. To enter the treatment phase of the study, a mean seated diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) > or = 95 and < or = 115 mm Hg was required. Patients were randomized to receive either losartan 50 mg once daily or enalapril 5 mg once daily. The dose of enalapril could be titrated to 10 mg at 4 weeks and 25 mg HCTZ could be added at 8 weeks based on SiDBP measurements at clinic visits. The dose of losartan remained at 50 mg; 12.5 mg HCTZ could be added after 8 weeks. Treatment regimen changes at each step were required if SiDBP remained > or = mmHg. Doses of the diuretic were selected based on commercially available forms of the test agents in combination with HCTZ. Valley blood pressure, heart rate, and safety parameters were measured at 4-week intervals during the treatment phase of the study. Significant reductions in mean SiDBP and mean sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) were achieved at all time points (4, 8 and 12 weeks) with both treatments. Overall, no significant differences were observed between treatment groups for mean changes in SiDBP or SiSBP. At the end of the study, patients receiving the losartan regimen had a mean reduction in SiDBP of 10.3 mm Hg, while patients on the enalapril regimen had a mean reduction of 9.8 mm Hg. Likewise, the percentage of patients who achieved the targeted reduction in blood pressure did not differ significantly between the groups. The mean reduction in SiDBP—but not SiSBP—was slightly greater in black patients in the losartan group than in the enalapril group (SiDBP, 10.0 mm Hg losartan vs. 8.0 mm Hg enalapril; P= 0.02). Similarly, losartan patients aged 65 years and older had a slightly greater decrease in SiDBP than matched enalapril patients (12.7 mm Hg vs. 8.7 mm Hg; P=0.03). The significance of these differences between the subgroups needs to be clarified by additional studies. Overall, both treatments were well tolerated. Treatment with losartan alone or in combination with HCTZ was effective in treating patients with essential hypertension and comparable to treatment with enalapril alone or in combination with HCTZ.

These pathways include chemical, therapeutic, or pathophysiological steps that can be taken to arrive at new insights based on ADRs. We used the development of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, specifically captopril, as a case study. The similarity between the ADR profiles of captopril and penicillamine was a starting point for further innovation. Historical analyzes show that research in the field of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was triggered by ADRs in several cases.

Patients with stable coronary artery disease and normal subjects served as controls. Sixty patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction (aged 32 to 74 years [mean 56.7]) were randomized to receive quinapril (n=25), metoprolol (n=25), and placebo (n=10). HRV was assessed 5 days (baseline) and 35 days after the onset of acute myocardial infarction. After the baseline studies, the post-myocardial infarction patients were treated with metoprolol (50 to 100 mg/day), quinapril (5 to 10 mg/day) or placebo. Twenty patients with stable coronary artery disease and 20 healthy volunteers, age and sex matched to myocardial infarction patients, were used as controls. Compared to placebo, quinapril and metoprolol significantly increased HRV indices 35 days after the onset of myocardial infarction. HRV indices were not statistically different between the two treatment groups. At baseline and after therapy, HRV was similar in patients with anterior wall or inferior wall myocardial infarction. The HRV 35 days after the onset of myocardial infarction was not different from the HRV in patients with stable coronary artery disease but was reduced compared to that in normal subjects. The data suggest that quinapril has the same beneficial effect on HRV indices as metoprolol in patients recovering from uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction.",0,0

Large studies have shown a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with long-term use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, or acute myocardial infarction. Reductions in acute ischemic events (e.g., myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and the need for early revascularization) were independent of ejection fraction and greater than expected based on the small reduction in blood pressure, suggesting that this is also the case in other patients with coronary artery disease If so, it could benefit from therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. This hypothesis will be tested in several double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials with a follow-up period of 3 to 5 years, which will involve approximately 30,000 patients. Studies vary in patient population (eg, normotensive vs. hypertensive, normolipidemic vs. hyperlipidemic, with vs. without diabetes mellitus), the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used, and outcome measures. If available, the results of these clinical trials could have very important implications for the role of long-term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in preventing or delaying the development of atherosclerosis-related ischemic events.",0,0

1827,8612477,Guidelines for the drug treatment of hypertensive crises.,,"Hirschl, M M","Hypertensive crises are a group of clinicopathologic entities that require rapid reduction of hypertension to prevent severe end-organ damage. Diagnosis and treatment plan depend on identification of a specific end-organ dysfunction. The goal of treatment is to limit the progression of end-organ damage in patients with hypertensive crises. Several powerful antihypertensive drugs such as sodium nitroprusside, labetalol, and urapidil are available to induce an immediate drop in blood pressure. The choice of drug should be based on its pharmacodynamic properties, clinical effects, benefits and contraindications. In addition, rapid lowering of blood pressure carries a significant risk if performed uncontrolled and leads to further end-organ damage. The goal of treatment is not just to lower blood pressure, but to do so with minimal side effects while maintaining organ function.",0,0

We tested whether acute ACEI could affect the effect of isometric training in patients with CHF. In the first part of the study, we showed that isometric training increased blood pressure in the control group and in the CHF group, while cardiac output increased only in the control group. Stroke volume remained unchanged in the control group, while it decreased significantly in the CHF group. Next, we analyzed the effect of acute ACEI (5 mg ramipril) on the decrease in cardiac output during isometric exercise in patients with CHF. During isometric training, mean blood pressure and heart rate increased similarly in both groups. However, cardiac output decreased by -0.48 +/- 0.12 L/min (p<0.01) with placebo but not with ACEI. Blood pressure spectral analysis showed an increase (p<0.01) in the high-frequency parasympathetic component from 7.3% +/- 3.6% to 18.1% +/- 9.5% after ACEI. plasma norepinephrine levels increased after isometric stress in the placebo group, while other hormones did not change. ACEI prevented the increase in norepinephrine after isometric exercise. Thus, the decrease in cardiac output during isometric exercise in patients with CHF was prevented by acute ACEI. The effect of ACE inhibition may be related to decreased sympathetic activity.",0,0
1829,8621193,Improvement in coronary flow reserve after long-term therapy with enalapril.,,"Motz, W; Strauer, B E","To date, no clinical study has shown an improvement in coronary flow reserve as a result of long-term antihypertensive therapy. Given the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to the process of hypertensive remodeling of the heart and coronary circulation, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may act as cardioreparative drugs in arterial hypertension. Accordingly, our aim in this study was to investigate under clinical conditions to what extent long-term antihypertensive treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor improves the reduced coronary flow reserve in hypertensive patients with microvascular angina pectoris. For comparison purposes, we also treated a normotensive control group of 6 patients with hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. Fifteen hypertensive subjects (10 males, 5 females; age 58 +/- 6 years) were treated with enalapril (10 to 20 mg/day; mean 16.7 +/- 4.9 mg/day) for 11 to 13 months . At the end of the treatment period, systolic pressure decreased from 178 +/- 14 to 137 +/- 12 mm Hg and diastolic pressure from 102 +/- 11 to 86 +/- 4 mm Hg under ambulatory conditions. Left ventricular muscle mass index decreased by 8% from 149 +/- 32 to 137 +/- 28 g/m2 (P < 0.05). Peak coronary blood flow after dipyridamole was increased by 43%, from 181 +/- 69 to 258 +/- 116 mL/min per 100 g (p<0.001), and minimal coronary vascular resistance was reduced by 29% from 0.66 +/- 0.23 to 0.47 +/- 0.24 mm Hg x min x 100 gx ml-1 (P < 0.001) after treatment with enalapril. Consequently, the calculated coronary reserve increased from 2.2 +/- 0.6 to 3.3 +/- 1.2 (p < 0.001). After therapy with enalapril, the functional class of angina pectoris according to the Canadian classification system had changed from 2.5 +/- 0.6 to 1.5 +/- 0.6 (p < 0.01). Maximum work capacity had increased from 23.775 +/- 3.970 to 26.255 +/- 4.598 J (mean +/- SE, P < 0.05). Maximum ST depression at maximum exercise was reduced from 0.18 +/- 0.02 to 0.06 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SE, (p < 0.01)). In summary, it can be said that long-term therapy with the angiotensin The converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril must be regarded as cardioreparative treatment with regard to the coronary microcirculation in hypertensive heart diseases.",0,0

The rate of weight loss on fat-modified diet and exercise was significantly associated with beneficial lipid changes. Significant differences (P<0.01) were observed between groups for mean changes during follow-up for each lipid. Reductions in plasma total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were greater for doxazosin and acebutolol (for plasma total cholesterol 0.36 and 0.30 mmol/L [13.8 and 11.7 mg/dL, respectively]), smaller for Chlorthalidone and placebo (0.12 and 0.13 mmol/L, respectively).

Elevations in HDL-cholesterol were greater for enalapril and doxazosin, and least for acebutolol. Significant relative increases in plasma total cholesterol with chlorthalidone compared with placebo at 12 months were absent at 24 months and beyond when mean plasma total cholesterol for the chlorthalidone group fell below baseline. Analysis of participants who continued to receive chlorthalidone through the 4-year follow-up indicated that this was not solely because an increasing percentage of participants changed or discontinued medication use during follow-up.; - Weight loss with a fat-modified diet plus increased exercise results in beneficial long-term effects on blood pressure and all plasma lipid fractions in adults with stage I hypertension; The reduction in blood pressure is similarly enhanced by the addition of a drug from any of the 5 classes of antihypertensive drugs.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are known to antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system through their ability to inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. A new class of antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, has recently been developed. These agents specifically block the angiotensin II receptor, thereby reducing angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction and decreasing aldosterone secretion. These effects result in a reduction in systemic arterial pressure through reduced vascular tone and improved sodium and water clearance. Clinical studies have shown the effectiveness of these agents in lowering blood pressure. These new antihypertensive agents also have uricosuric effects and are well tolerated, with a low incidence of cough and angioedema, side effects seen with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Clinical trials are underway to see if these drugs will be useful in treating diseases other than high blood pressure, such as heart failure and chronic kidney disease.",0,0

Ten patients were evaluated after a 2-week placebo run-in period and after 8 weeks of active treatment with a 2-week placebo washout between treatments. At the end of each period, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured as 51Cr-EDTA and 123I-hippuran clearance, respectively, and tubular function assessed by the lithium clearance technique was determined. Both drugs maintained GFR and ERPF and reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP, mm Hg) to similar extents (time x treatment, P=0.466): amlodipine from 126.9 +/- 2.5 to 115.9 +/- 2.2; Perindopril from 126.9 +/- 2.5 to 117.9 +/- 3.9 (time effect of all treatments combined, P=0.003).

At the basal reading, the two groups had comparable BP and LV parameters. After treatment, both groups showed similar and significant reductions in 24-hour, day and night systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP). The reduction in LV mass index was greater (p<0.01) in Group 2. In Group 1, the percent decrease in LV mass correlated significantly with the percent decrease in 24-hour and daily BP; this was not true for group 2. Along with the reduction in LV hypertrophy, there was a significant increase in the maximum rate of elongation of LV diameter, which was greater in group 1 (p<0.01). Both drugs can reduce LV hypertrophy and improve diastolic function. The reduction in hypertrophy induced by perindopril appears to be partially independent of the reduction in blood pressure and therefore partially related to a direct effect of perindopril on the myocardium.",0,0

Previous data suggest that plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) may increase proportionally more than plasma ANP after AMI and in chronic heart failure. The diagnostic and prognostic value of plasma BNP as an indicator of left ventricular dysfunction and long-term survival after AMI compared to ANP and N-ANP remains to be established.; Venous blood samples for analysis of ANP, N-ANP and BNP were collected on day 3 after symptom onset from 131 patients with documented AMI. The left ventricular ejection fraction was determined by echocardiography in a subsample of 79 patients. During the follow-up period (median 1293 days), 28 cardiovascular and 3 non-cardiovascular deaths occurred. All three peptides were strong predictors of cardiovascular mortality in univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyzes (ANP: P<0.0001; N-ANP: P=0.0002; BNP: P<0.0001). In a multivariate model, plasma BNP (p=0.021) but not ANP (p=0.638) or N-ANP (p=0.782) provided additional prognostic information beyond left ventricular ejection fraction. Logistic regression analysis showed that ANP (p=0.003) and N-ANP (p=0.027) but not BNP (p=0.14) were significantly associated with left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 45%; These results suggest that plasma BNP determination provides important, independent prognostic information after AMI. Although plasma ANP appears to be a better predictor of left ventricular dysfunction, plasma BNP could be used for risk stratification after AMI due to its strong, independent association with long-term survival, improved in vitro stability, and greater potential to complement standard prognostic indicators have simplicity of analysis.",0,0

The urinary excretion of 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha, stable breakdown products of prostacyclin, was measured after a one-month run-in period. To determine whether lowering blood pressure (BP) affects prostacyclin biosynthesis, 106 consenting patients with a diastolic pressure of 90-120 mmHg were randomized to treatment with bendrofluazide, metoprolol, quinapril, or amlodipine in an open-label, parallel-group design. The dose was increased to reduce diastolic arterial pressure to < 90 mm Hg. Terazosin was added when this target blood pressure was not met, and its dose was increased when needed. The urinary excretion rates of prostaglandins were measured after 1 year in patients in whom the target diastolic pressure was reached. Mean arterial pressure varied between 106 and 168 mm Hg in untreated patients and clearance of both prostacyclin-derived products varied between < 5 and > 350 ng/g creatinine.

Nevertheless, the treatment of patients with CHF remains a therapeutic challenge. The second Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT II) showed that the mean 2-year mortality with enalapril (18%) was significantly lower than that with hydralazine isosorbide dinitrate (25%) but, somewhat surprisingly, the non-specific vasodilators produced significantly more improvement in exercise performance and left ventricular function. Such data suggest that improvement in symptoms, hemodynamics, and survival may not be achieved through the use of a single class of vasodilator therapies, but could be optimized through the combined use of different agents. This report describes the rationale and design of V-HeFT III, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to compare the effects of felodipine 2.5 to 5 mg twice daily with extended oral release (felodipine ER). in addition to a stable regimen of enalapril and loop diuretics, with or without digoxin, on exercise performance, morbidity, and mortality in patients with New York Heart Association functional class II to III CHF followed for at least 12 weeks. Felodipine is a second-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a high degree of vascular selectivity that exerts its systemic arterial effects at the doses used in this study by lowering peripheral vascular resistance without producing negative inotropic effects. The results of V-HeFT III may shed important light on the role of additive vasodilator therapy in the management of patients with CHF.",0,0

We investigated whether alacepril, a new long-acting oral ACE inhibitor, has beneficial effects against exercise-induced angina in patients with stable angina after substantial treatment with isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN). Thirteen men with stable angina pectoris were treated with oral ISDN (80 mg/d) for > 3 weeks. After this period, the efficacy of a single oral dose of either alacepril (50 mg) or its placebo on exercise-induced angina and electrocardiographic changes was assessed by treadmill exercise testing in a double-blind crossover design.

Lisinopril was significantly more effective than hydralazine in reducing nocturnal systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Plasma norepinephrine was significantly reduced by lisinopril and increased by hydralazine. Left ventricular mass was significantly reduced by lisinopril but not by hydralazine. The results of the linear regression analysis and the multiple regression analysis indicated that the lisinopril-induced decrease in blood pressure both during the day and at night could be responsible for the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, while the lack of regression of left ventricular hypertrophy during treatment with hydralazine could be due to it may be due primarily to drug-induced sympathetic reflex activation.",0,0

1863,8673930,Bradykinin-evoked sensitization of airway sensory nerves: a mechanism for ACE inhibitor cough.,,"Fox, A J; Lalloo, U G; Belvisi, M G; Bernareggi, M; Chung, K F; Barnes, P J","Cough accompanied by increased sensitivity of the cough reflex is the most common symptom of inflammatory airway disease. This symptom is also commonly reported in patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy for heart failure or high blood pressure, although the underlying mechanism is unknown. We have investigated the possibility that the inflammatory peptide bradykinin, which is normally cleared by ACE, causes sensitization of airway sensory nerves and an enhancement of the cough reflex in conscious guinea pigs. Two-week treatment of guinea pigs with captopril resulted in an increased cough response to inhaled citric acid, which was prevented by concomitant treatment with the bradykinin receptor antagonist icatibant. A similar icatibant-sensitive enhancement of citric acid-induced cough was observed in untreated animals after prior inhalation of bradykinin, although hypertonic saline-induced cough was unaffected. In in vitro electrophysiological studies, single vagal C-fiber responses to capsaicin applied to receptive fields of single-fiber units in the trachea were also markedly increased after bradykinin perfusion, while delta A-fiber responses to hypertonic saline remained unaffected. These results suggest that bradykinin-induced sensitization of airway sensory nerves may underlie the pathogenesis of ACE inhibitor cough. Bradykinin receptor antagonists may be of use in the treatment of chronic cough associated with this and other inflammatory diseases.",0,0

Role of the renin-angiotensin system.,,"Hennes, M M; O'Shaughnessy, I M; Kelly, T M; LaBelle, P; Egan, B M; Kissebah, A H","Resistance to insulin's ability to suppress lipolysis may be an important link in the link between abdominal obesity and hypertension. In addition, a more active renin-angiotensin system in adipose tissue may contribute to insulin-resistant lipolysis in abdominally obese hypertensive individuals. We determined unesterified fatty acid concentrations and turnover and lipid oxidation under basal conditions and during steady-state euglycemia with two levels of insulinemia (72 and 287 pmol/L) in lean normotensive, abdominally obese normotensive, and abdominally obese hypertensive subjects. To assess the role of the renin-angiotensin system in determining non-esterified fatty acid turnover, we repeated the studies in abdominally obese hypertensive patients after double-blind random assignment to placebo or enalapril for 1 month each. The main results were the following: (1) The flux of non-esterified fatty acids was significantly higher in abdominally obese hypertensive subjects at both levels of insulinemia than in abdominally obese normotensive or lean normotensive subjects and correlated significantly with both mean blood pressure and total systemic resistance during the higher insulinemia. (2) Enalapril significantly improved insulin-resistant lipolysis in abdominally obese hypertensive subjects. The improvement in insulin suppressibility of non-esterified fatty acid flux at the high hormone concentrations was positively correlated with the extent of blood pressure reduction. (3) Basal lipid oxidation and suppression in response to insulin were similarly impaired in both obese groups. Resistance to the antilipolytic effects of insulin is thus a characteristic of subjects with abdominal obese hypertension and may be associated with the elevated blood pressure in these subjects. A more active renin-angiotensin system may partially explain insulin-resistant lipolysis in this form of hypertension.",0,0
1865,8677862,Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme after myocardial infarction: the trandolapril cardiac evaluation study.,,"Torp-Pedersen, C; KÃ¸ber, L; Carlsen, J","To investigate the importance of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor administration in patients with compromised systolic function after a heart attack, the Trandodolapril Cardiac Evaluation Study was designed so that the majority of patients with echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction were on patients screened consecutively included infarcts. A total of 2606 consecutive patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction corresponding to an ejection fraction < or = 35% were identified. Of these patients, 1749 (67%) were randomized to receive oral trandolapril or placebo beginning days 3 to 7 post-infarction. The follow-up period was 2 to 4 years. Trandolapril reduced all-cause mortality, with a relative risk reduction associated with trandolapril treatment of 0.78 (p=0.0013). Benefit was seen within 1 month of treatment. Trandolapril also reduced cardiovascular death (relative risk 0.75, p=0.001), sudden cardiac death (relative risk 0.76, p=0.03) and progression to severe/refractory heart failure (relative risk 0.71, p = 0.003). Recurrent myocardial infarctions (fatal or non-fatal) were not significantly reduced (relative risk 0.86, p=0.29). More than 80% of patients in both treatment groups reached the target dose of 4 mg trandolapril or placebo at the end of the dose titration. Almost half of the patients in both treatment groups discontinued study medication before death or completion of the study. The need for overt ACE inhibition was the reason for discontinuation in 48 and 75 patients in the trandolapril and placebo groups, respectively. In conclusion, long-term treatment with trandolapril significantly reduced mortality and morbidity in patients with impaired left ventricular function shortly after myocardial infarction. Most patients received the target dose of 4 mg trandolapril daily. The observed benefit likely reflects the benefit in clinical practice as the majority of eligible patients were randomized and the difference between patients who left the study to receive open-label ACE inhibition was modest.",1,1

We tested this treatment modality on 70 hypertensive patients with severe kidney disease of various origins. We report a double-blind study of the effect of enalapril 5 mg once daily compared to placebo in patients with non-diabetic severe chronic renal impairment (plasma creatinine 2.8 to 6.8 mg/dl; mean creatinine clearance 15 ml/min/l .73 m2), followed by up to 2 years. Efficacy parameters were slopes of 51Cr-EDTA clearance, reciprocal of plasma creatinine, creatinine clearance and effect on urinary protein excretion. 31 patients completed the 2-year treatment (12 in the enalapril group and 19 in the placebo group). Two patients died from non-renal causes (one patient each in the enalapril and placebo groups), 16 patients started dialysis (seven in the enalapril group and nine in the placebo group), and eight patients were discontinued due to side effects discontinued (five in the enalapril group). group and three in the placebo group). Eleven patients were discontinued for non-compliance, non-cooperation, or relocation (nine in the enalapril group and two in the placebo group). Two patients treated with enalapril were excluded from the study due to protocol deviations. Importantly, the statistical approach in this study evaluated all patients regardless of treatment duration. A mixed effects linear model and an intention-to-treat analysis accounting for the number of observations per patient showed that enalapril significantly reduced the rate of renal disease worsening: glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.038), reciprocal of plasma creatinine (P = 0.017) or creatinine clearance (P=0.031). The renal protective effect of enalapril has been shown to be in addition to its antihypertensive effect when blood pressure is kept constant. Proteinuria was reduced by enalapril (p=0.007) and slightly increased in placebo-treated patients (p=0.051). The difference between these two groups was highly significant (p=0.002). In summary, enalapril delayed the progression of chronic renal failure as determined by changes in glomerular filtration rate, creatinine clearance and 1/plasma creatinine and reduced proteinuria in patients with severe chronic renal failure without diabetes.",0,0

Enalapril did not modulate fibrinogen, white blood cell count, or elastase while B-beta-30-43 peptide had decreased levels, although the proportion of patients with levels above the reference cut-off did not differ from placebo. In summary, in the 6-month phase after the acute myocardial infarction, while platelet function is only activated during the first week after the acute myocardial infarction, fibrinogen and leukocyte function continue to be activated in a significant proportion of patients during the 6 months . These signs can indicate an ongoing atherosclerotic process. Enalapril has no significant impact on these reactivities.",0,0

An initial dose of 10 mg once daily was titrated to 40 mg once daily based on tolerability. All patients received diuretic therapy; Digoxin was optional. The primary endpoint was maximum exercise time on the bike; A secondary endpoint was the occurrence of the following prospectively defined, orderly clinical events indicative of worsening heart failure: death, study discontinuation, hospitalization, emergency room visit, and need for additional diuretics.

The study consisted of a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (two periods of insulin infusion at rates of 0.4 and 1 mU/kg/min, 2 h for each step) in combination with indirect calorimetry. The most notable findings concerned a significantly faster time course of glucose infusion rates during the first 30 minutes of each insulin infusion period [analyzed by calculating the slopes (S1 and S2)] after ramipril administration than placebo. The mean glucose infusion rates achieved during the last 30 minutes of each insulin infusion period (G1 and G2), as well as increases in carbohydrate oxidation rates during clamping (C1-C0 and C2-C0), and decreases in plasma unesterified fatty acids (A0-A1 and A0-A2) were not significantly different after ramipril and placebo. According to robust principal component analysis of S1, S2, G1, G2, C1, C2, A1 and A2 (orthogonal to C0 and A0), insulin sensitivity was improved with ramipril compared to placebo (p=0.013).

Power spectral analysis of 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring was performed in 30 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline, after 1 year of treatment with lisinopril, and after 1 month of drug discontinuation. At the same time, patients underwent 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, echocardiographic examination, and assessment of plasma renin activity. Treatment with lisinopril increased plasma renin activity and reduced 24-hour systolic and diastolic pressures (from 159 +/- 14 to 121 +/- 8 and from 103 +/- 7 to 80 +/- 3 mm, respectively Hg) and left ventricular mass index (from 159 +/- 33 to 134 +/- 26 g/m2); In addition, normalization of the left ventricular mass was achieved in 12 of 30 patients.

In the overall study population, only radiofrequency power was higher after treatment with lisinopril. In the subgroup of patients with left ventricular mass normalization, day and nighttime high frequency power, total and nighttime very low frequency power were higher after 1 year of treatment compared to baseline. In the remaining 18 patients, post-treatment power spectrum readings were slightly lower than at baseline and even lower after drug discontinuation. Therefore, in patients with hypertension and hypertrophy, treatment with lisinopril improves sympathovagal imbalance when normalization of left ventricular mass is achieved. In patients without left ventricular mass normalization, drug cessation is followed by deterioration in cardiac neural control.",0,0

At baseline, clinically measured systolic/diastolic blood pressure averaged 175/86 mm Hg and mean 24-hour and daytime ambulatory blood pressure values were 148/80 and 154/85 mm Hg, respectively. After 13 months (median) of active treatment blood pressure in the hospital fell by 22.7/7.0 mm Hg and 24-hour and daily BP by 10.5/4.5 and 9.7/4.3 mm Hg, respectively (p<0.001 for Everyone).

After subtracting placebo effects, mean net blood pressure reductions during active treatment were only 12.9/5.4, 8.3/3.4, and 6.8/3.2 mm Hg for clinical, 24-hour or daytime blood pressure values.

The mean hourly systolic and diastolic BP changes for placebo were (median) 21% (range -1% to 42%) and 25% (range -3% to 72%) of the corresponding changes during active treatment, respectively. In summary, the effect of antihypertensive treatment on blood pressure, expressed in millimeters of mercury, is greater for conventional measurement than for ambulatory measurement. Regardless of whether blood pressure is measured by conventional blood pressure measurement or by ambulatory monitoring, a significant proportion of the long-term blood pressure changes observed during active treatment can be attributed to placebo effects. Therefore, ambulatory monitoring uncorrected for placebo or control observations, like conventional blood pressure measurement, overestimates BP responses in long-duration clinical trials.",0,0

Intravenous enalaprilat or placebo was administered <24 hours after MI and was continued orally for 6 months. LV volumes were assessed by echocardiography 3 +/- 2 days, 1 and 6 months after MI. The change in LV diastolic volume during the first month was attenuated with enalapril (2.7 vs. placebo 6.5 ml/m2 change; p<0.05), and significantly lower LV diastolic and systolic volumes were observed with treatment with Enalapril compared to placebo observed at 1 month (enalapril 47.21 23.9 vs. placebo 53.1/29.2 ml/m2; p<0.05) and at 6 months (enalapril 47.9/24.8 vs. placebo 53.8/29.6 ml/m2 (p<0.05). EF was also significantly higher in these patients 1 month after MI (enalapril 50.4% vs. placebo 46.4%; p<0.05).

Cardiorespiratory effects of long-term, continuous IV administration of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat were studied. 2. Forty-five consecutive critical condition patients suffering from trauma or postoperative complications were randomly divided into three groups (15 patients in each group) receiving either 0.25 mg h-1 or 0.50 mg h -1 received enalaprilat or saline as placebo (= control group). The infusion was continued for 5 days. 3. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were intensively monitored upon admission to the ICU (= ""baseline"" values) and daily for the next 5 days. 4. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) decreased significantly only in the patients treated with enalaprilat, while heart rate (HR) remained unchanged in these patients. 5. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) were reduced by enalaprilat (0.50 mg h-1): PAP (mean +/- standard deviation) decreased from 28.0 +/- 4.1 to 24 .0 +/- 3.0 mm Hg ) and remained significantly lower than in the control group. In the untreated control group, cardiac index (CI), oxygen consumption (VO2I), and oxygen output (DO2I) decreased significantly, which was attenuated by enalaprilat infusion. Oxygen extraction (O2-extr) increased in both enalaprilat groups (0.25 mg h-1: from 26.1 +/- 5.5 to 30.4 +/- 4.0%; 0.50 mg h- 1: 25.2 +/- 5.6 to 30.9 +/- 4.4%) and decreased in the control patients. 6. Right ventricular hemodynamics improved with enalaprilat infusion (0.50 mg h-1: RVEF increased from 40.0 +/- 3.5 to 45.5 +/- 4.0%). Plasma lactate concentrations decreased in the enalaprilat 0.50 mg h-1 group (from 1.9 +/- 1.0 to 1.3 +/- 0.3 mg dl-1) and increased in the control patients . 7. Continuous infusion of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat exerted beneficial cardiorespiratory effects in the critically ill. The widespread overall risk of altered perfusion with decreased CI, DO2, VO2, O2-extr and increased lactate concentration was attenuated by enalaprilat infusion. 8. Although 0.5 mg h-1 enalaprilat was most effective, a dose of 0.25 mg h-1 also demonstrated beneficial hemodynamic effects in the critically ill.",0,0

Cough resolution in eight hypertensive patients with ACE inhibitor-induced cough was examined in a prospective observational study over a period of 4 weeks. Cough resolution was measured by visual analog scales and a questionnaire at baseline and on days 3, 7, 14, and 28. In addition, changes in cough sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin and skin reactions to bradykinin and substance P were measured at the same time points. 2. All patients experienced significant subjective improvement in cough questionnaire scores for severity and nocturnal awakenings, and by visual analog scales for cough severity and frequency (all P<0.0005 for trend from days 0-28). Significant changes in subjective measurements were recorded for most measurements at days 3 to 7, but further reductions were observed through day 28 (all P<0.01 day 28 vs. day 0). 3. Sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin decreased over the 28 days of the study after stopping enalapril. The potency of capsaicin compared to day 0 was reduced to 0.25 (95% CI 0.07-0.87) by day 14 and 0.20 (95% CI 0.06-0.67) by day 28 . 4. After stopping enalapril, there was a highly significant reduction in wheal area induced by intradermal bradykinin, with most of the effect seen by day 3 (p<0.0005). The area of wheals to intradermal substance P also decreased with time after enalapril discontinuation, but significant changes were not observed until 14 days (P<0.01). 5. Multiple regression analysis of the rates of decrease for the subjective and objective measures of cough showed significant associations between response to inhaled capsaicin and VAS scores for cough severity (P=0.005) and cough frequency (P=0.011). The capsaicin response was not significantly related to the severity of the cough as measured by a self-administered questionnaire. 6. There was a significant association between bradykinin response and VAS scores for cough frequency (p<0.04) and cough severity (p<0.05), but not with questionnaire cough or capsaicin Reaction. Response to substance P was not significantly related to any of the cough measurements. 7. Cough caused by enalapril improved markedly after 14 days but took up to 28 days to resolve. It was associated with increased sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin, which decreased over 28 days and was accompanied by changes in subjective cough scores.",0,0

This study examines cough recorded on prescription event monitoring (PEM) of four ACE inhibitors. Particular attention was paid to the study of enalapril because the drug was monitored before the causal relationship between cough and ACE inhibitors was widely accepted. RESULTS. In the case of PEM, too, several factors proved to be a hindrance, which in the individual cases had obscured the causal connection. For example, cough was a common and non-serious event and underreported in the PEM study of enalapril, and the rate was not strikingly different from that recorded for other drugs. Cough induced by ACE inhibitors has several characteristics that reduce the likelihood of a detectable ""signal."" The original questionnaires returned by physicians in the enalapril PEM study were re-examined. The observation that the cough rate decreased after stopping enalapril rather than increasing after starting provided the best evidence for causality as this was not influenced by many biases such as B. the public that had occurred before physicians participating in PEM completed later reports.",0,0

In previous studies, a single 2 mg intravenous dose of levosimendan increased cardiac output (CO) by approximately 40% in healthy subjects and decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 40-50% in patients with heart failure. The aim of the present double-blind study was to evaluate the safety of the concomitant use of levosimendan and an ACE inhibitor.; The hemodynamic effects of levosimendan given with or without captopril were assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography, repeated blood pressure measurements and ambulatory ECG recordings. Twenty-four male patients with stable NYHA II-III heart failure (EF < 40%) after a prior myocardial infarction received a single IV infusion of levosimendan or placebo in a randomized order. The infusions were repeated after 2 weeks of treatment with up to 50 mg captopril twice daily. Twelve patients received levosimendan 1 mg and twelve received 2 mg; Average CO increased from 6.0 to 6.8 1. min-1 in patients receiving 1 mg levosimendan compared to placebo, but only from 6.3 to 6.5 1 . min-1 in patients receiving 2 mg. The increase in CO was statistically significant when all levosimendan patients were compared to placebo. Heart rate did not change after any dose. The mean stroke volume increased significantly after 1 mg but not after 2 mg levosimendan. The addition of captopril did not change the effect of levosimendan. No additional reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure was observed when levosimendan and captopril were co-administered. It appears that concomitant treatment with captopril does not alter the haemodynamic effects of levosimendan. No adverse haemodynamic interactions were observed.",0,0

Baseline measurements were made for plasma renin activity (PRA), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR). Captopril (12.5 mg) was administered sublingually with dibasic potassium phosphate, which maintained salivary pH at 7, or orally with 100 ml of water. Additional BP, HR measurements and venous blood samples were taken over a 3 hour period after drug administration. Blood samples were analyzed for captopril and PRA levels.; tmax after buffered sublingual administration of captopril, which ranged between 40 and 60 min (median = 40 min), was significantly shorter than after peroral administration (range 60 to 120 min, median = 90 min). Cmax was slightly higher after buffered sublingual administration than after oral administration with mean values of 108.2 vs. 94.0 ng.ml-1. AUC values were similar after both routes of administration. The profiles of systolic and diastolic blood pressure versus time were significantly different for each route of administration, i.e., sublingual administration resulted in an earlier reduction in blood pressure, however, heart rate did not differ significantly between the two routes of administration.; The data show that this novel delivery method of captopril results in an increased rate but an unchanged extent of captopril absorption, suggesting a modest therapeutic benefit of using buffered sublingual captopril when rapid blood pressure reduction is required.",0,0

Five patients (Group II) who did not have ACEI-related cough were also challenged as controls. Results showed that two patients (40%) in Group I had BHR with the mean PC20 at 15 mg/mL methacholine solution. On the other hand, none of the patients in Group II showed BHR.

ACE breaks down substance P in the airways, so the cough mechanism may be related to this peptide.; Nine patients who developed a cough and five patients who did not develop a cough while taking the ACE inhibitor enalapril (2.5 or 5.0 mg/day) for high blood pressure were included in the study. No subject had respiratory disease and all subjects had normal respiratory function. One month after stopping enalapril, a 15- to 30-minute inhalation of hypertonic saline (4%) was performed with an ultrasonic nebulizer to induce sputum. The concentration of substance P in the sputum sample was measured by radioimmunoassay. In four of the nine cases with coughing, enalapril was given again for 1-2 weeks and the concentration of substance P in the induced sputum was remeasured.; One month after enalapril discontinuation, the mean (SE) sputum concentration of substance P in the coughing group was 16.6 (3.0) fmol/mL, significantly higher than that in the non-coughing group (0.9 (0 ,5) fmol/ml ). All four subjects in the coughing group who received repeat dosing of enalapril developed a cough again, but concentrations of substance P in the induced sputum during enalapril dosing were (17.9 (3.2) fmol/ml). similar to when taken without enalapril (20.0 (2.5) fmol/mL); Mechanisms of ACE inhibitor-induced cough may involve substance P-mediated airway preparation.

A total of 7,001 consecutive enzyme-confirmed AMIs (6,676 patients) were screened for enrollment in the TRandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study. Medical history, echocardiographic estimation of LV systolic function as measured by wall motion index, infarct complications, and survival were documented for all patients. To investigate the importance of congestive heart failure and wall motion index independently of age, we performed Cox proportional hazard models in 4 different age strata (< or = 55 years, 56 to 65 years, 66 to 75 years and > 75 years). . . Patients in these strata had 1-year mortality rates of 5%, 11%, 21%, and 32%, respectively. The three-year mortality rates were 11%, 20%, 34%, and 55%, respectively. The risk ratios (and 95% confidence limits) associated with congestive heart failure in the same 4 age groups were 1.9 (1.3 to 2.9), 2.8 (2.1 to 3.7), 1.8 (1, 5 to 2.2) and 1.8 (1.5 to 2.2).

A single initial 1 mg dose of cilazapril administered at the end of HD session resulted in a marked improvement in interdialysis thirst scores and a concomitant reduction in plasma angiotensin II (AII) concentration due to inhibition of ACE activity. The body weight gain between the dialysis treatments was significantly lower in the treatment period with cilazapril than in the non-treatment period. None of the other parameters, including blood pressure, plasma osmolarity, and serum Na and K concentrations, differed in the treatment versus non-treatment period. The available data help to explain the potential pharmacological effect of AII on the physiology of thirst and suggest that cilazapril may be effective in relieving dialysis-associated hyperdipsia, at least in some cases. The mechanism by which ACE-I exerts an antidipsogenic effect can be partially explained by the reduction in plasma concentration of AII as a result of ACE inhibition.",0,0

Fosinopril/Hydrochlorothiazide Investigators.,,"Guthrie, R; Reggi, D R; Plesher, M M; Saini, R K; Battikha, J P","24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was used to assess the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor fosinopril (Fos) in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) at doses of 10/12.5 mg and Assess 20/12.5 mg once daily versus placebo in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In two methodologically identical studies, the antihypertensive effects were assessed using 24-hour ABPM and using seated diastolic (DBP) and systolic (SBP) blood pressure. After a 4- or 5-week placebo washout, 79 patients received randomized, double-blind treatment for 8 weeks with either the Fos/HCTZ 10/12.5 mg dose combination (n = 41) or placebo (n = 38) and In der In the second study, 62 patients were treated with either the Fos/HCTZ 20/12.5 mg dose combination (n=30) or placebo (n=32). Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes from baseline over 24 h were similar for both doses (SBP/DBP with 10/12.5 mg, -18.2/-10.1 mmHg, P<or=0.001; SBP/DBP with 20.001) significantly different from placebo /12.5 mg, -22.9/ -11.2 mmHg, P<or=0.001); while ambulatory SBP and DBP were virtually unchanged in the placebo group. Although the blood pressure lowering effect of the higher Fos/HCTZ dose combination (20/12.5 mg) appeared to be greater than that of the lower dose (10/12.5 mg), no attempt was made to compare the two doses in these to conduct two independent studies. This difference in blood pressure reduction was not reproduced by the blood pressure measurements in practice. Both dose combinations of Fos/HCTZ resulted in significantly greater reductions in DBP in the seated office than placebo at all time points tested, with a maximum treatment effect (drug effect - placebo effect) of -7.3 mmHg for the 10/12.5 mg dose and -8 .2 mmHg for the 20/12.5 mg dose after 8 weeks of therapy (P<or=0.01). Based on the results obtained in these studies, both dose combinations of Fos/HCTZ taken once daily were safe and effective in treating patients with mild to moderate hypertension. A 24-hour ABPM showed an apparent increased reduction in blood pressure with the higher Fos/HCTZ dose combination (20/12.5 mg) at peak and trough values that were not reproduced by real-world blood pressure measurements, suggesting greater sensitivity 24 -h-ABPM to assess the antihypertensive effect.",0,0

Relationship to changes in skeletal muscle blood flow.,,"Andersson, P E; Lithell, H","In a previous open-label study of the metabolic effects of doxazosin in patients with essential hypertension, a subgroup analysis showed that patients with an accumulation of risk factors for coronary artery disease (high VLDL triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and high fasting blood glucose) appeared to benefit the most the metabolic effects of doxazosin treatment. These results formed the basis of this double-blind, parallel-group study conducted to elucidate the metabolic effects of 6-month treatment with doxazosin and enalapril in patients with essential hypertension and hypertriglyceridaemia. Insulin sensitivity was measured using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp method. Hemodynamic evaluation included measurements of office and ambulatory blood pressure and ultrasound measurements of blood flow in the femoral artery. Both drugs significantly reduced both in-office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure. The systolic blood pressure was reduced significantly better by enalapril. In contrast to enalapril, doxazosin significantly increased insulin sensitivity (by 21%, P=0.02). It also reduced serum triglycerides (by 23%, P=0.01), VLDL triglycerides (by 30%, P=0.008), and VLDL cholesterol (by 24%, P=0.02). This lipid-lowering effect of doxazosin was accompanied by an increase in both plasma lipoprotein lipase activity and the elimination rate of an intravenous lipid emulsion load. Neither treatment significantly increased blood flow in the femoral artery. It is speculated that without measurably increasing blood flow in conducting vessels such as the femoral artery, doxazosin might increase the transit time for blood across the muscle bed through capillary recruitment, which could explain the increased glucose output and increased lipoprotein lipase activity.",0,0

Will lowering LDL-cholesterol in elderly with moderate hypercholesterolemia reduce cardiovascular disease incidence and all-cause mortality? These important medical practice and public health issues are designed to be addressed by the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind study of 40,000 high-risk hypertensive patients. ALLHAT is designed to determine whether the combined incidence of fatal coronary artery disease (CAD) and nonfatal myocardial infarction differs between people randomized to receive treatment with a diuretic (chlorthalidone) and each of three alternative treatments—a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), an angiotensin-converting Enzyme - were subjected to inhibitors (lisinopril) and an alpha-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin).

In this study, we firstly examined whether this cardiac abnormality is related to structural or functional vascular abnormalities, and secondly, the effect of antihypertensive treatment by administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (50 mg twice daily orally) for 12 months. In essential hypertensive subjects with dipyridamole-echocardiographic stress test (DET) (DET+, n=8) and without (DET-, n=8) ST-segment depression greater than 0.1 mV during intravenous dipyridamole infusion (0, 84 mg/kg over 10 min), we examined the endothelium -dependent vasodilator, induced modifications of forearm blood flow (FBF, venous plethysmography, ml/100). and by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (1, 2, 4 micrograms/100 ml/min x 5 min each), a smooth muscle cell relaxant compound. The minimum vascular resistance of the forearm (MFVR), an index of arteriolar structural changes, was also calculated. Both Ach and SNP caused greater vasodilation in DET- compared to DET+, while MFVRs were lower in DET- compared to DET+. After treatment, both DET+ and DET- patients showed a significant and similar reduction in blood pressure and left ventricular mass index, while vasodilation on acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside was increased only in the DET+ group. Furthermore, minimal vascular resistances in the forearm were significantly reduced only in DET+ patients, who showed resolution of dipyridamole-induced ischemia-like ST-segment depression. Taken together, these data confirm that patients with essential hypertension with microvascular coronary disease are characterized by the presence of structural changes in the vascular bed of the forearm. Our results also indicate that both cardiac and vascular abnormalities of the forearm can be reversed by antihypertensive treatment with an ACE inhibitor.",0,0

1900,8733032,Does high salt intake cause hyperfiltration in patients with essential hypertension?,,"Mallamaci, F; Leonardis, D; Bellizzi, V; Zoccali, C","In animal models of salt-dependent hypertension, hyperfiltration is associated with a more rapid decline in renal function, and there is evidence that increased creatinine clearance is a marker of early hypertensive nephropathy in hypertensive humans. We examined the influence of salt intake on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (creatinine clearance) in 14 patients with mild hypertension. Each patient was studied in a random order and according to a crossover design at habitual salt intake, high salt intake (ie, habitual +50/100 mmol/day), and low salt intake (habitual -50/100 mmol/day). Protein, calcium, and potassium intakes were assessed across the three study periods. The control group consisted of seven healthy volunteers. High salt intake caused a significant (P<0.01) increase in 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the expected suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone. Seven patients were classified as salt sensitive. GFR was significantly higher (P < 0.01) with high salt intake (125 +/- 10 mL/min) than with usual (113 +/- 7 mL/min) and with low salt intake (97 +/- 6 mL/min). minutes). Minimum). Overall, urinary salt excretion was significantly associated with GFR (P<0.01 by correlation analysis for repeated observations) and the slope of this relationship predicted that a 100 mmol/day increase in salt intake was associated with a 14.6 increase in salt intake ml/min is linked to GFR. The relationship between GFR and 24-hour urinary salts in salt-sensitive patients was no different from that in salt-resistant patients. The GFR response to salt exposure was largely independent of the renin-aldosterone system. No change in arterial pressure or GFR was observed in healthy subjects. With fixed protein intake, changes in salt intake in the physiological range are associated with important GFR variations in mild hypertensive subjects. As long as hyperfiltration in mild hypertension is a predictor of worsening renal function, high salt intake, independent of the effect of arterial pressure, could be a factor contributing to nephronic obsolescence in patients with essential hypertension.",0,0
1901,8733038,Greater reduction in urinary albumin excretion in hypertensive type II diabetics with incipient nephropathy with lisinopril than with nifedipine.,,"Agardh, C D; Garcia-Puig, J; Charbonnel, B; Angelkort, B; Barnett, A H","double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational study evaluated the effects of 12 months of treatment with lisinopril (10-20 mg once daily) or nifedipine prolonged-release tablets (20-40 mg twice daily) in 239 men (18 years of age) compared -75 years) and 96 postmenopausal women (aged 40-75 years). They all had a history of clinically stable type II diabetes > 3 months, microalbuminuria and early diabetic nephropathy (a urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in the range of 20 to 300 micrograms/min) and a sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 -100 mmHg (Korotkoff phase V) included on admission and after 3-4 weeks of placebo treatment. The goal of treatment was to achieve a reduction in sitting DBP to < 90 mmHg 24-30 hours after the last lisinopril dose or 12-18 hours after the last nifedipine dose and to increase the effect of these treatments on UAE above 12 rate months. The effect of the two treatments on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) was also examined in a subset of patients. Treatment of diabetes with oral antidiabetics, diet and insulin alone or in combination was allowed. The median UAE with lisinopril fell from 65.5 (range 20-297) micrograms/min at baseline to 39.0 (2-510) micrograms/min at 12 months. With nifedipine, the median UAE fell from 63.0 (range 20-289) micrograms/min at baseline to 58.0 (9-1192) micrograms/min at 12 months. The estimated median difference between the effects of the two treatments was 20 micrograms/min (p=0.0006). Over 12 months, both treatments resulted in a similar drop in seated blood pressure from 163 +/- 17/99 +/- 6 mm Hg (mean +/- standard deviation) to 147 +/- 18/88 +/- 10 mm Hg for lisinopril and from 161 +/- 18/97 +/- 5 mm Hg to 150 +/- 18/88 +/- 9 mm Hg for nifedipine. Ambulatory blood pressure was assessed in a subset of patients, and comparison of the effects of the two treatments using areas under the blood pressure-time curve (AUC) showed no differences between the treatments. Creatinine clearance, glycemic control (HbA1c) and lipid profiles did not change significantly during any of the treatments. The rates of discontinuations and adverse events were similar for both treatments. We conclude that despite similar effects on both blood pressure and glycemic control in type II diabetics with hypertension, lisinopril has a significantly more beneficial effect on UAE than nifedipine.",0,0

We report a combined analysis of 235 normotensive IDDM patients with microalbuminuria who participated in two 24-month double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies to investigate the effects of captopril 50 mg twice daily on progression to overt clinical albuminuria. Of the 225 patients evaluable on an intent-to-treat basis, 25 of 114 placebo-treated patients (21.9%) and 8 or 111 captopril-treated patients (7.2%) developed persistent clinical albuminuria. The risk of progression over 24 months was significantly reduced by captopril (p=0.004) with a risk reduction of 69.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 31.7 to 86.1%). This degree of risk reduction remained at the same level (62.9% [16.1-83.6%], p=0.017) after adjustment for differences in time-dependent mean arterial pressure. The albumin excretion rate increased by a mean of 14.2% [3.1-26.5%] per year in the placebo-treated group compared to a decrease of 9.6% [-18.6-0.4%] per year in the captopril-treated group (p=0.002).

To calculate the surface area ratio, the area under the treatment effect curve was divided by the product of the maximum antihypertensive effect and the dosing interval (24 hours). The reproducibility of the valley-to-peak and surface ratios was examined by the Bland and Altman techniques. After 2 months, lisinopril (+/- standard deviation) reduced 24-hour pressure by 13 +/- 16 mmHg systolic and by 8 +/- 8 mmHg diastolic (p<0.001). Using the usual approach, without accounting for inter-subject variability, the trough-to-peak ratio was 0.7 for systolic and diastolic pressure. When daily treatment effect curves with a resolution of 1 h were examined in individual patients, the median trough-to-peak ratio for systolic pressure was 0.30 (5th-95th percentile interval [PI]: -0.51, 0, 82) and 0.28 for diastolic pressure (PI: -0.37, 0.78); the corresponding values for the area ratio were 0.33 (PI: 0.03, 0.58) and 0.30 (PI: -0.01, 0.55). Similarly, trough-to-peak ratios and surface area ratios increased as each blood pressure profile was smoothed stepwise by subdividing 1-hour averages, 2-hour moving averages, 2-hour averages, 3-hour moving averages or have been replaced by 3-hour averages. The distributions of trough-to-peak ratios and surface area ratios were abnormal in 37 out of 40 cases (p<0.001, Shapiro-Wilk test). Consistency was higher (p<0.001) for surface area than trough-to-peak ratios. The intra-subject reproducibility of the surface area ratios tended to be better than that of the corresponding valley-to-peak ratios. In summary, the surface area ratio provides an index of the duration of action of antihypertensive drugs. Furthermore, in the present patients, surface area ratio tended to be characterized by higher within-subject reproducibility than trough-to-peak ratio.",0,0

After a placebo run-in period of 1-4 weeks, patients were randomized to one of five treatment groups: placebo (n=48), spirapril 1.5 mg (n=48), spirapril 3 mg (n=53) , spirapril 6 mg (n=51) or enalapril 5/10 mg (n=48). The primary objective was to assess changes in exercise tolerance, and the secondary objective was to assess cardiovascular signs and symptoms, quality of life, ejection fraction, and chest x-ray findings. exercise tolerance increased in all groups; however, no statistically significant differences were found between the groups. There was a statistically significant reduction in mortality in the pooled spirapril groups compared to placebo and a trend towards a reduction in serious cardiovascular adverse events and length of hospital stay. These effects and improvements in pulmonary congestion appeared to be dose dependent. In patients with moderate to severe heart failure, the combination with first-generation calcium channel blockers had an unfavorable effect on exercise capacity and clinical parameters. Spirapril could be an effective alternative to enalapril in the treatment of patients with CHF. The role of exercise tolerance testing in demonstrating the efficacy of ACEIs in CHF and the widespread use of nifedipine in CHF is questioned.",1,0
1919,8752803,Which patient will benefit from early inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme after myocardial infarction? One-year serial echocardiographic follow-up results from the Captopril and Thrombolysis Study (CATS).,,"van Gilst, W H; Kingma, J H; Peels, K H; Dambrink, J H; St John Sutton, M","In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of an intervention with captopril within 6 h after the onset of myocardial infarction on left ventricular volume and clinical signs of heart failure in relation to infarct size during a follow-up period of 1 year.; The remodeling of the heart begins in the early phase of myocardial infarction and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, initiated in the subacute or late phase after myocardial infarction, has been shown to improve prognosis.; In the captopril and thrombolysis study, 298 patients with a first anterior myocardial infarction treated with intravenous streptokinase were randomized to receive either oral captopril (25 mg three times a day) or placebo. Left ventricular volume index was determined by two-dimensional echocardiography within 24 hours, on days 3, 10, and 90, and after 1 year; A small but significant increase in left ventricular volume indices was observed at 12 months. Using a random coefficient model, no significant treatment effect on left ventricular volume could be detected. In contrast, using survival models, the incidence of left ventricular dilatation was significantly lower in captopril-treated patients (p=0.018). In addition, the incidence of heart failure was lower in the captopril group (p<0.03). This effect appeared early and was most pronounced in patients with a moderately sized infarct (p=0.04) and was absent in large infarcts.; Very early treatment with captopril after myocardial infarction significantly reduces the occurrence of early dilatation and the progression of heart failure. These data underscore the importance of early treatment. In addition, patients with moderate infarct size benefit most from this treatment strategy.",1,1

TREND (Trial on Reversing ENdothelial Dysfunction) investigated whether quinapril could improve endothelial dysfunction in normotensive patients with coronary artery disease and without heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or major lipid abnormalities, such that confounding variables affecting endothelial dysfunction could be minimized.; Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design, we measured the effects of quinapril (40 mg daily) on the response of coronary artery diameter to acetylcholine using quantitative coronary angiography. The primary response variable was the net change in acetylcholine-evoked constriction of target segments between baseline (pre-randomization) and 6-month follow-up angiograms. Baseline constrictive responses to acetylcholine were comparable in the placebo (n=54) and quinapril (n=51) groups. At 6 months, only the quinapril group showed a significant net improvement in response to incremental concentrations of acetylcholine (4.5 +/- 3.0% [mean +/- SEM] versus -0.1 +/- 2.8% at 10 (-6) mol/L and 12.1 +/- 3.0% versus -0.8 +/- 2.9% at 10 (-4) mol/L, quinapril versus placebo, overall p = 0.002) ; TREND shows that ACE inhibition with quinapril improved endothelial dysfunction in patients who were normotensive and had no severe hyperlipidemia or signs of heart failure. These benefits of ACE inhibition are likely due to the attenuation of the contractile and superoxide-generating effects of angiotensin II and to the enhancement of endothelial cell release of nitric oxide as a result of decreased bradykinin breakdown.",0,0

The researchers of the SMILE study. Survival of myocardial infarction long-term evaluation.,,"Borghi, C; Ambrosioni, E; Magnani, B","Chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common disease responsible for high mortality and morbidity, the clinical course of which can be improved by inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). However, there are limited data on the effects of ACE inhibitors on the onset and progression of CHF in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The present study was conducted as a substudy of the long-term assessment study Survival of Myocardial Infarction and included 1,146 patients with anterior wall AMI who were not undergoing thrombolysis, excluding patients with a history or clinical signs of CHF at admission. Patients were randomized to treatment with zofenopril (7.5 to 30 mg twice daily) or placebo for a cumulative period of 6 weeks. The prevalence of CHF, either mild to moderate or severe, was the primary objective and was assessed at 6 weeks and 1 year after AMI. The overall prevalence of CHF was not reduced by zofenopril at either 6 weeks or 12 months. Conversely, the prevalence of severe CHF (1.6% vs. 2.6%: risk reduction 55.5%; 95% confidence interval 9 to 63; p=0.0325) and the combined occurrence of death or severe CHF (4.8% vs. 8.2%: risk reduction 59%; 95% confidence interval 11 to 71; p=0.024) were reduced after 6 weeks of treatment with zofenopril. In addition, the percentage of patients who progressed to severe CHF at 1 year was significantly reduced with zofenopril (11.0% vs. 24.3%; p=0.001).

The efficacy of both drugs was similar on urinary albumin excretion (Westlake test p=0.19). However, blood pressure was lower with nicardipine than with captopril (p<0.05) and the antialbuminuric effect of nicardipine was related to its antihypertensive effect, while captopril was not.

A previous Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) study suggested that neurohumoral activation precedes the development of symptoms, as demonstrated by elevated neurohormonal levels in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. However, the significance of this early neurohumoral activation is unclear. The aims of this study were to determine the prognostic significance of plasma norepinephrine (PNE) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations and renin activity (PRA) in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.; PNE and PRA were measured before randomization in 514 patients with left ventricular ejection fractions < or = 35% who did not require treatment for congestive heart failure and who were enrolled in the SOLVD prevention study. Due to study design, plasma ANP levels were measured in a subset of 241 patients. Using Cox's proportional hazards model, which included left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association functional class, age, gender, assignment of treatment to placebo or enalapril, and cause of heart failure, we examined whether these neurohormones All-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality predicted hospitalization for heart failure, development of heart failure, or development of ischemic events (myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris). PNE was the strongest predictor of clinical events in this patient population. PNE values above the median of 393 pg/mL were associated with a relative risk of 2.59 (p=0.002) for all-cause mortality, 2.55 (p=0.003) for cardiovascular mortality, and 2.55 (p=0.005) for hospitalization associated for heart failure, 1.88 (P=0.002) for development of heart failure, 1.92 (P=0.001) for ischemic events, and 2.59 (P=0.005) for myocardial infarction. PNE remained the most powerful predictor of all-cause mortality and ischemic events when the analysis included only patients with a history of ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. The increases in other neurohormonal levels were not useful in predicting the subsequent development of clinical events.; Elevated levels of PNE in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction appear to predict all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, as well as the development of clinical events associated with the onset of heart failure or acute ischemic syndromes. Therefore, measurement of PNE may be a possible early marker to assess disease progression in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, and modulation of PNE release or action may lead to improved prognosis and/or reduced morbidity.",0,0

However, there is very little information on the direct effect of increased afterload on cardiac output in these patients and the possible beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors as adjunctive therapy to thrombolysis, beta-blockers and nitrates. We therefore examined the effects of captopril as adjuvant therapy to thrombolysis, beta-blockers and nitrates (standard therapy) on left ventricular performance in 77 consecutive patients with uncomplicated acute Q-wave myocardial infarction by measuring the pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio before and after (0 .25-0.50 mg) phenylephrine administration on the 4th and 30th day after the infarction.

In the patients of group 1, the left ventricular function worsened significantly after administration of phenylephrine. This was reflected by an increase in the pre-ejection duration/left ventricular ejection time ratio only in the subgroup of patients with an ejection fraction < 40% as measured by contrast ventriculography on both day 4 and 30 post-infarction, differing from 0.435 + changed /- 0.070 to 0.528 +/- 0.101, P<0.01 and from 0.404 +/- 0.098 to 0.515 +/- 0.092, P<0.02, respectively.

In the remaining patients with an ejection fraction > or = 40%, there were no significant changes on either the 4th or the 30th postinfarction day.

A four-way ANOVA also found a significant reduction in heart rate in patients with an ejection fraction < 40% from day 4 to day 30. The results indicate that: (1) the pre-ejection time/left ventricular ejection time ratio after increasing afterload may be a useful non-invasive method for detecting left ventricular dysfunction in myocardial infarction patients; and (2) captopril adjuvant therapy improves left ventricular performance response in asymptomatic Q-wave postinfarct patients and favorably affects heart rate compared to thrombolysis, beta-blockers, and nitrates alone following phenylephrine administration.

Microalbuminuria has been suggested as a possible predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of quinapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with high tissue affinity for the enzyme, on AER in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and no evidence of diabetes mellitus. In this 12-week, 24-center study, quinapril was administered to 213 patients and titrated to 10, 20, or 40 mg/day alone, or 20 mg/day plus 12.5 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide. Overall blood pressure increased from 155.2 +/- 18.1/101.8 +/- 6.7 mm HG (mean +/- SD) to 144.4 +/- 17.8/92.3 +/- 8.9 mm HG (P=0.0001) and AER decreased from 20.6 +/- 24.3 mg/24 h to 14.5 +/- 15.4 mg/24 h (p=0, 0001). Blood pressure reductions were significant in all age groups. The AER at endpoint was 37.5% in elderly patients, 29.8% in middle-aged patients, and 11.8% in young patients of 32.5 +/- 45.0 mg/24 h, 19.1 +/- 20.9 mg/24 h and 16.1 +/- 16.9 reduced mg/24 h. AER decreased in 60% of patients with normal AER (0 to 30 mg/24 h), 79% of patients with microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg/24 h), and 90% of patients with proteinuria ( > 300 mg /24 h) at the beginning of the course. Baseline log-AER correlated with SBP (p=0.0126, r=0.19) and creatinine clearance (p=0.026, r=0.17), while endpoint log-AER with SBP (p=0.0015, R=0.25) correlated and DBP (P=0.03, R=0.17). In summary, we have shown in a large group of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and no evidence of diabetes mellitus that quinapril not only significantly lowers blood pressure but also reduces microalbuminuria.",0,0
1937,8785399,Mechanism of the antiproteinuric action of cyclosporine in membranous nephropathy.,,"Ambalavanan, S; Fauvel, J P; Sibley, R K; Myers, B D","Forty-one patients with nephrotic syndrome and biopsy-proven membranous nephropathy were given 3 to 6 months of treatment with cyclosporine (CsA; 4 to 5 mg/kg per day). Different solute clearances were used to assess glomerular function before and after therapy. CsA reduced mean proteinuria by 56% from 7.3 to 3.2 g/24 h (p<0.0001). The corresponding mean increases in serum albumin, immunoglobulin G, and oncotic pressure were 31, 32, and 26%, respectively (all P<0.0001). Arterial pressure, GFR, and renal plasma flow remained constant, but CsA restored the dextran sieve curve to normal and decreased the calculated proportion of shunt-like pores by 25% (P<0.05). In 14 cases, a cross-over design was used to randomize patients to 3 months of CsA versus 3 months of enalapril (10 to 30 mg daily), separated by a 1-month washout interval. Although enalapril reduced arterial pressure by 8 mm Hg (P<0.01), it had no effect on proteinuria, plasma protein composition, filtration dynamics, or dextran sieving (all P=not significant). CsA-dependence of proteinuria, indicated by recurrent nephrosis after CsA withdrawal, required additional CsA cycles to keep proteinuria subnephrotic in most patients. In six patients with declining GFR during prolonged CsA treatment, a repeat biopsy revealed more prominent immune deposits and a thicker glomerular basement membrane than at baseline. It was concluded that: (1) CsA decreases proteinuria in MN in part by increasing barrier size selectivity; (2) the lack of comparable potency of enalapril suggests that the antiproteinuric effect of CsA is related to its immunosuppressive rather than its glomerulodepressor properties; but (3) as judged by repeat biopsy, CsA does not prevent the continued formation of autoantibodies in this disorder.",0,0
1938,8785466,ACE inhibitors in elderly patients with hypertension. Special considerations.,,"Ravid, M; Ravid, D","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have emerged as the class of antihypertensive and vasodilators of first choice in the management of elderly patients with hypertension. Normotensive patients with congestive heart failure, postanterior myocardial infarction, or diabetes mellitus with signs of microangiopathy also benefit from continuous ACE inhibition. Long-term use of ACE inhibitors is associated with improved survival and reduced cardiovascular, cerebral and renal morbidity in these patients. In elderly atherosclerotic patients, these agents provide good control of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and peripheral resistance, with remarkable maintenance of blood flow to vital organs and rare side effects. When used as monotherapy, the efficacy of ACE inhibitors is limited. However, there are advantages to using it in combination with other drugs, especially thiazide diuretics, nitrates, and calcium antagonists. This preserves kidney function and prevents left ventricular hypertrophy. There are no major differences between the various ACE inhibitors and the choice of drug is largely a matter of personal preference.",0,0
1939,8785469,The changing face of hypertension and antihypertensive drugs.,,"Kitler, M E","In summary, much needs to be done to encourage thinking among both patients and healthcare providers about disease risks and benefits of healthcare, including pharmaceutical options. Health professionals have been relatively ineffective patient educators, perhaps because the old “doctor knows best” paternalism still persists. In addition, too little attention has been paid to improving the communication skills of healthcare professionals. Most likely, one of the reasons is the pressure to control costs, which limits the time healthcare professionals spend consulting patients. Suboptimal compliance has even been reported in large-scale studies. For example, 90% compliance was reported in the SHEP study (perhaps due to patient selection), but only 80% compliance was achieved in the left ventricular dysfunction (SOLVD) studies. Poor adherence to long-term treatment, both through lifestyle changes and pharmacological therapy, has been identified as the main reason for inadequate control of elevated blood pressure; Some sources claim that only 25% of all hypertensive patients have their blood pressure under control. Therefore, planned patient education efforts should be undertaken as these can significantly improve blood pressure control and reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hypertension. To achieve this, the patient must become an active participant in the planned regimen and not remain a passive recipient (Table III).",0,0

Pharmacokinetic data and clinical studies as well as side effects, drug interactions and dosing guidelines are reviewed.; A MEDLINE search was conducted for English language literature published from 1966 to 1995. In addition, Merck and Co. provided bibliographic data for losartan.; The focus was on human clinical and pharmacokinetic studies. Controlled, double-blind studies were evaluated to assess the efficacy and side-effect profile of losartan.; Losartan is a non-peptide, competitive antagonist of type I angiotensin II receptors. In comparative clinical studies, losartan appears to have a blood pressure lowering effect similar to that of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Losartan is well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to placebo and a lower incidence of cough compared to ACE inhibitors. A combination preparation consisting of losartan 50 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg is also approved for the treatment of high blood pressure. The combination product is not indicated for initial therapy but is recommended for patients who do not respond adequately to losartan monotherapy. The angiotensin II receptor antagonists are also being studied for beneficial effects in patients with ventricular hypertrophy, renal disease and heart failure.; Losartan, the first angiotensin II receptor antagonist to receive approval in the US, appears to be an effective new antihypertensive drug with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. Losartan may be an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. However, the effect of losartan on mortality remains to be investigated. The role of angiotensin II receptor antagonists in areas such as ventricular hypertrophy, renal function and heart failure remains to be determined.",0,0

Patients were randomized to placebo or moexipril 3.75, 7.5, or 15 mg once daily as add-on therapy to open-label HCTZ 25 mg. At biweekly visits, blood pressure and heart rate measurements were taken and the occurrence of side effects was documented. At the 8-week endpoint, the adjusted mean reductions from baseline were significantly (p=0.003) greater in patients receiving moexipril 3.75, 7.5 and 15 mg compared to placebo (-8.4, -8 .8 and -8.9 vs. -4.6 mmHg). No significant differences were observed between the three dose levels of moexipril. Moexipril was generally well tolerated. The most commonly reported adverse reactions for moexipril and placebo were headache, influenza syndrome and dizziness (6.7.5 vs. 4.0.4%).

Eleven of 24 patients completed a 6-month treatment course with captopril monotherapy (50 mg twice daily). The hemodynamic and hormonal response elicited by a final dose of 50 mg captopril was reassessed in the 11 subjects who maintained their blood pressure control with captopril monotherapy for 6 months.; The drop in blood pressure 3 hours after ingestion was comparable for the first and the last 50 mg captopril dose. Although the initial response to captopril only increased plasma levels of Ang I, the response to the last dose of the drug (6 months after) caused significantly higher levels of Ang I and Ang-(1-7). Neither acute nor chronic therapy with captopril had a significant effect on the plasma concentrations of Ang II. Although the plasma levels of prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha were not changed by a first dose of captopril, the concentrations of 6- Keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, but not prostaglandin E2, increased significantly in patients treated with the inhibitor for 6 months. A negative correlation was also demonstrated between diastolic blood pressure and plasma Ang (1-7) levels in the 11 patients with essential hypertension in whom blood pressure was controlled with captopril monotherapy.; Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with captopril had a significant effect on blood pressure that was not directly explained by suppression of plasma Ang II levels.

In an open prospective study, we examined 14 patients with previously untreated hypertension (163 +/- 2/104 +/- 2 mm Hg) and an echocardiographically determined left ventricular mass index of 141.6 +/- 5.2 g/m2, which indicates left ventricular hypertension indicates hypertrophy. We took a buttock skin biopsy prior to the start of treatment to assess the morphology and function of the subcutaneous small artery (approximately 200 to 400 microns in diameter). The patients then received antihypertensive treatment with a combination of spirapril (3 or 6 mg) and isradipine (2.5 or 5 mg). Echocardiography was taken at 6 months and 1 year, and a final biopsy was taken at 1 year. At 1 year, blood pressure was significantly reduced to 142 +/- 3/90 +/- 1 mmHg (p<0.001) and left ventricular mass index significantly decreased to 105.3 +/- 5.8 g/m2 (p<0.001) . 001). Media lumen ratio at baseline (7.64 +/- 0.48%) was not significantly reduced (7.21 +/- 0.55%), although a decrease occurred in 7 of 12 evaluable patients. Norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction was markedly reduced after 1 year. In conclusion, a significant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy was achieved after 1 year of treatment with spirapril and isradipine, while a similar reduction in medial thickness relative to lumen diameter of subcutaneous small arteries could not be observed in all patients. Reversal of structural changes in resistance vessels may require a longer duration of treatment in patients with established left ventricular hypertrophy.",0,0
1944,8794833,Lisinopril reverses left ventricular hypertrophy through improved aortic compliance.,,"Shimamoto, H; Shimamoto, Y","We treated 38 patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy with nifedipine or lisinopril. The study had a single-blind crossover design; Nifedipine or lisinopril were given for the first 24 weeks, and then the patients were switched to the other antihypertensive drug for an additional 24 weeks. Both nifedipine and lisinopril significantly decreased mean arterial pressure to the same extent. Although lisinopril reduced left ventricular mass index faster than nifedipine, 48 weeks of antihypertensive treatment with nifedipine or lisinopril reduced the extent of left ventricular hypertrophy to the same level. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the reversal in left ventricular hypertrophy may be primarily due to a reduction in mean arterial pressure during 24 weeks of nifedipine treatment and an improvement in aortic compliance during lisinopril treatment. Both nifedipine and lisinopril are effective in reversing hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy; however, the agents have differential effects on hemodynamic factors.",0,0

After stopping all previous antihypertensive drugs, patients entered a placebo lead-in period of 4–6 weeks, followed by 24 weeks of randomized treatment with the active substances, administered using a double-dummy technique. The dose of fosinopril was 20 mg, which could be increased to 40 mg after 8 weeks (mean 25.6 mg); that of enalapril was 10 mg, which could be increased to 20 mg after 8 weeks (mean 12.9 mg). Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg could be added after 16 weeks and was administered to 27% of patients in the fosinopril group and 30% of patients in the enalapril group.

The number of reported AE was not statistically different in the two groups. Inhibition of ACE was assessed in a subgroup of patients (n=26, 13 in each group). Fosinopril caused greater inhibition of ACE at the doses used in the present study, which was statistically significant. Both fosinopril and enalapril produced statistically significant reductions in blood pressure of a similar magnitude, and both agents were well tolerated. However, fosinopril was consistently slightly more potent than enalapril numerically in lowering blood pressure.

1947,8800625,risk-benefit assessment of ACE inhibitor therapy after myocardial infarction.,,"Borghi, C; Ambrosioni, E","The use of ACE inhibitors in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) has been the subject of several studies conducted in recent years. These studies have demonstrated the ability of these agents to improve both survival and morbidity in patients with MI. However, the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with MI has been shown to lower blood pressure (BP) and thus could compromise the ischemic myocardium. A significant reduction in systemic blood pressure was demonstrated in all studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with MI, but no association was found between the occurrence of hypotension and worse clinical outcome. An increased risk of death has been observed only in association with severe and sudden hypotension, the occurrence of which can be largely averted by administration of the ACE inhibitor according to an escalating dose titration schedule. Conversely, some degree of long-term reduction in blood pressure could result in some beneficial effect in patients with MI and contribute to the lower incidence of reinfarction observed in patients with acute MI undergoing long-term treatment with captopril. Because the renin-angiotensin system is closely related to renal function, its blockade by an ACE inhibitor could result in some degree of renal dysfunction, particularly in patients with MI and compromised ventricular function. The available results from large studies suggest that abnormalities in renal function (namely an increase in serum creatinine) are observed in 0.9 to 2.4% of patients with myocardial infarction, which nevertheless confer some benefit from treatment with ACE inhibitors draw. Interestingly, administration of ACE inhibitors does not appear to further impair the severely compromised renal function and may also provide a useful tool for the management of patients with renal dysfunction associated with MI. The use of ACE inhibitors in patients with MI is associated with a satisfactory clinical and laboratory safety profile. The incidence of significant adverse events appears to be very low and mainly due to a rather modest prevalence of cough (2.4 to 6.8%). Less than 1% of treated patients discontinued treatment due to biochemical and hematological abnormalities. Thus, the beneficial effects of treatment with ACE inhibitors appear to outweigh the safety concerns, reinforcing the role of ACE inhibition as an appropriate therapeutic strategy in the management of patients with MI.",0,0

Since 1985, 50 phase III-IV studies investigating antihypertensive efficacy in patients with hypertension have been conducted; 32 were controlled studies with comparator treatment and 18 were open-label studies with lacidipine treatment.; A total of 16,590 patients received lacidipine; 13,419 in open-label studies and 3,171 in double-blind, comparative studies. Overall, these patients contributed 5,124 person-years (Pj). In addition, 1810 patients received an active comparator treatment and 451 patients received a placebo; Both fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events were estimated. Efficacy (change in blood pressure and heart rate), side effect rates, and dropout rates were compared for the different treatment regimens. The reasons for dropping out were also compared. Side effects were also analyzed in terms of when they occurred and their duration.; Blood pressure was lowered by 2-6 mg lacidipine; in the controlled studies from 166/102 to 144/85 mmHg. Heart rate dropped from 75.6 to 74.1 beats per minute. The estimated event rate for a possible myocardial infarction in all studies was 5.46 per 1000 years. The fatal event rate (all causes) was 5.27 per 1000 years and the estimated fatal cardiovascular event rate was 2.93 per 1000 years. In a long-term study (48 weeks) with 2282 patients (1658 PY), the observed rate of fatal events (all causes) was 4.2 per 1000 PY.

The side effects of lacidipine were those expected, e.g. B. headache, hot flashes, pedal edema and palpitations.; In analyzing the data available for lacidipine and some comparator drugs in nearly 19,000 hypertensive patients, we found lacidipine to be an effective and well-tolerated drug with a reasonable side-effect profile typical of a dihydropyridine-type calcium antagonist. Our study has the obvious limitations of a retrospective analysis of data derived from a large cohort of patients, most of whom received lacidipine for a relatively short period of time.

The top 20 drugs accounted for 57% of all liver reactions. Fifty-seven percent were reported in women. Hepatotoxicity was most commonly reported in patients aged 50 to 80 years. Liver reactions were associated with a 3.3% mortality rate but accounted for 7.4% of all fatal events. Over the past 21 years, the number of reports has steadily increased. Although most reports of liver damage were received between 1988 and 1994, mortality was lowest during this period. There were significant differences in the drugs associated with hepatic reactions during each of the three periods, although erythromycin was consistently the most common cause. Erythromycin has been linked to two deaths. Halothane and perhexilene were the leading causes of death and two of the most important causes of liver damage during the first and second periods. Diclofenac, Augmentin and Flucloxacillin were important causes of hepatotoxicity during period 3 but were not associated with a fatal outcome.; Hepatic reactions accounted for 4.2% of all adverse drug reactions and 7.4% of all fatal events.

After a two-month run-in period with single-blind placebo, hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to two groups, one of which had a target pressure of seated diastolic pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg with conventional blood pressure measurement (conventional blood pressure [CBP] group), and one with daytime blood pressure (from 10 to 20 h) a diastolic pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg had to be reached (ambulatory blood pressure [ABP] group). After randomization, all patients were started on lisinopril 10 mg/day. One month later, lisinopril could be continued or discontinued at 10 or 20 mg/day depending on the blood pressure achieved. This article is an interim report of 207 patients followed for two months during the study. At one month, lisinopril was discontinued more frequently in the ABP group than in the CBP group (24 versus 9 patients, p=0.004). Nevertheless, blood pressure control after two months was not significantly different in the two treatment groups. The baseline-adjusted differences in systolic pressure between the two treatment arms of the study (ABP-CBP group) was +2.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI]): -2.9, +8.3) for the conventional Pressure, +0.4 mm Hg (CI: -4.3, +5.1) for 24-hour pressure, -0.1 mm Hg (CI: -5.1, +4.8) for daytime pressure and -0.7 mm Hg (CI: -6.7, +5.4) for nocturnal pressure.

Captopril exerted different effects: variance and HF component increased by +176 +/- 55%; (P<0.007) and +126 +/- 44% (P<0.015), respectively. LF/HF ratio (low/high frequency) decreased (-44 +/- 19%; P < 0.04) along with heart rate (-4 +/- 1%; < 0.009). It is concluded that, unlike nifedipine, captopril increases HRV and decreases LF/HF ratio and is therefore a better choice in hypertensive patients potentially prone to dangerous arrhythmias.",0,0

CONSENSUS II Multi-Echo Study Group.,,"Edner, M; Bonarjee, V V; Nilsen, D W; Berning, J; Carstensen, S; Caidahl, K","Although the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril has recently been shown to reduce mortality and the need for hospitalization in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure, this drug has no significant impact on short-term mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI ) in the CONSENSUS II study. The effect of enalapril initiated early after AMI on clinical and echocardiographic determinants of left ventricular (LV) function was evaluated in a subset of patients from CONSENSUS II.; Heart failure symptoms and signs were classified into NYHA and dyspnea classes. Echocardiography included LV end-systolic volume (ESV) and end-diastolic volume (EDV), as well as ejection fraction (EF), wall motion index (WMI), and mitral flow indices. A total of 428 patients were enrolled and followed up for a mean period of 5.1 months through serial examinations beginning 2-5 days after myocardial infarction (MI) and repeated at 1 month and at the end of the study.; There was no beneficial effect of enalapril on clinically assessed function. Changes (i.e., NYHA class changes) in functional status remained correlated with changes in echocardiographic determinants throughout the study in patients in the placebo group: EDV index (r = 0.36, p = 0.002, ESV index (r = 0.49 , p<0.001), EF (r=−0.41, p<0.001), and WMI (r=0.29, p=0.008) In a stepwise logistic regression model, the best baseline parameters to predict NYHA class were at last visit in all patients age (p=0.014) and ESV index (p=0.001) Treatment with enalapril for a median of 5.1 months after MI resulted in no clinically significant beneficial effects on NYHA and dyspnea class clinical functional class correlated with changes in echocardiographic determinants in placebo-treated patients but not in patients given enalapril.",1,0
1956,8824693,Effects of acute and chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition by spirapril on cardiovascular regulation in patients with essential hypertension. Assessment by spectral analysis and hemodynamic measurements.,,"Veerman, D P; Douma, C E; Jacobs, M C; Thien, T; Van Montfrans, G A","1. The effects of a first dose and chronic treatment with spirapril, a novel angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on short-term fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate were assessed by fast Fourier spectral analysis. The effects on systemic hemodynamics in the supine and standing positions were also examined. We treated 11 patients with spirapril 3 mg and 13 patients with 12 mg for 8 weeks. 2. The general blood pressure variability was not altered by spirapril. Spectral analysis can be used to assess changes in blood pressure and heart rate variability in different frequency bands, which may be related to changes in the activity of the autonomic nervous system. The relative power in the mid-frequency band (0.08-0.12 Hz) of systolic pressure in the supine position was 23 +/- 10% with placebo and decreased to 11 +/- 4% during treatment with 12 mg (p < 0 .01 vs. placebo, first dose) and to 13 +/- 6% (P < 0.01, chronic treatment). Standing systolic mean frequency performance was 38 +/- 12% on placebo and decreased to 27 +/- 9% (P < 0.01 vs. placebo) after the first 12 mg dose, but it did not decrease after chronic treatment ( 29 +/- 13%). Treatment with 3 mg induced no changes in mean-frequency blood pressure variability. A decrease in mid-frequency band power may indicate a decrease in sympathetic vascular drive. Power in the high frequency band (0.15-0.40 Hz) of heart rate did not change after treatment, suggesting that there is no change in vagal cardiac drive. 3. Supine blood pressure decreased by a decrease in vascular resistance of 16 +/- 23% (3 mg) and 14 +/- 19% (12 mg) after 8 weeks of treatment. Heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output did not change. No orthostatic hypotension occurred after the first dose. In the 12 mg group, the orthostatically induced increase in heart rate (compared to supine) increased from +9 +/- 5 bpm (placebo) to +14 +/- 4 bpm (P < 0, 05) after the first dose. There were no changes in orthostatic heart rate rise in the 3 mg group. The orthostatic changes in stroke volume, cardiac output and vascular resistance were not affected by spirapril. 4. In conclusion, the decrease in mean-frequency blood pressure variability may indicate an inhibitory effect of acute and chronic ACE inhibition on sympathetic vasomotor control. Vagal activity was unaffected as high-frequency heart rate variability did not change. Acute and chronic ACE inhibition did not dampen important cardiovascular reflexes since the hemodynamic response to orthostasis remained intact.",0,0

1958,8828013,Undesirable metabolic effects of antihypertensive drugs. consequences for treatment.,,"Preuss, H G; Burris, J F","Adverse metabolic effects have been associated with drugs used to treat high blood pressure, particularly diuretics and beta-blockers. These effects include electrolyte, glucose/insulin, lipid and uric acid disorders. This may at least partially explain why early studies examining the effect of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy with diuretics and beta-blockers showed beneficial effects on coronary artery disease that disappointingly fell short of the predicted effect. Among the therapeutics, diuretics cause disturbances in electrolyte homeostasis, e.g. B. hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hyponatraemia. In contrast, ACE inhibitors cause hyperkalemia under certain circumstances. Both diuretics and beta-blockers, particularly nonselective beta-blockers that lack intrinsic sympathomimetic capabilities, have been associated with disorders of glucose/insulin metabolism and can cause deleterious changes in circulating plasma lipid profiles. Hyperuricemia associated with diuretic use appears to be a problem only in patients predisposed to high circulating levels of uric acid.",0,0

This applies to their basic mode of action at the cellular level as well as in the clinical environment in patients. New pharmaceutical agents such as renin inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and aldosterone antagonists not only provide new insights into the importance of various components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in heart failure, but also into the mode of action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. This manuscript also includes a brief update on the organization of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and other angiotensin II-forming signaling pathways with particular relevance to heart failure. Data on the potential relevance of genetic polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are discussed. Perhaps the most important observation in clinical cardiovascular medicine in 1995 was the report of a highly significant interaction between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and aspirin on mortality in patients with ventricular dysfunction with or without heart failure.

1962,8841011,Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme after acute myocardial infarction with special reference to the Fourth International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-4).,,"Syed, M; Borzak, S; Jafri, S M","The role of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of asymptomatic or symptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is well established. More recently, large clinical trials have evaluated the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors early after AMI, ie within 24 hours of symptom onset. This concept arose with an understanding of the pathophysiological changes that occur after AMI. Post-AMI neurohormonal activation and ventricular remodeling underlie these changes, while the extent of LV dysfunction remains strongly predictive of a poor outcome. The large clinical trials with mortality endpoints have shown a modest benefit of early use of ACE inhibitors in an unselected population. However, the generalized use of ACE inhibitors remains controversial because of the overall low benefit. We review the pathophysiological changes that occur after AMI, the rationale for the early use of ACE inhibitors, and the available data from the large clinical trials. We recommend considering an early ACE inhibitor in all but the lowest risk patients. Clinical features of such a low-risk population include small and nonanterior infarcts in patients less than 65 years of age and with LV ejection fractions greater than 50%. Objective assessment of LV function is warranted during hospitalization for AMI to appropriately select patients for ACE inhibitor therapy. Dosing should be initiated cautiously to avoid hypotension and titrated to target doses used in the large studies. The duration of therapy in patients at high risk of death or ventricular enlargement should be unlimited. Additional large-scale secondary prevention studies with long-term treatment are underway to investigate the effect of ACE inhibition on coronary disease progression and reinfarction.",0,0

Thirty NIDD-hypertensive subjects (age = 50 +/- 3 years; BMI = 30 +/- 1 kg/m2) (mean +/- SEM) were studied before and after 12 weeks of antihypertensive treatment. Ten patients were treated with doxazosin (Cardura) (2–8 mg once daily or 8 mg twice daily), 9 with captopril (Capoten) (25–50 mg twice daily), and 11 with nifedipine (Procardia-XL) (30–60 mg ) treated once a day). Blood pressure, creatinine clearance, 24-hour urinary protein excretion, fasting plasma glucose concentration, and glycated hemoglobin were measured before and after drug treatment. Fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) before the start of antihypertensive therapy were similar in all three groups and did not change significantly from baseline in any treatment group. In the doxazosin group, creatinine clearance increased from 99 +/- 8 to 122 +/- 8 ml/1.73 m2.min (p < 0.01), while protein excretion in 24-hour urine increased from 2. 66 +/- 0.05 decreased to 1.76 +/-. 0.02 mg/day/mL/1.73 m2.min (p<0.01).

Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were similar for doxazosin (150 +/- 3/95 +/- 2 mmHg), captopril (153 +/- 3/93 +/- 1), and nifedipine (155 +/- 4/93) +/- - 1) groups before starting antihypertensive therapy and decreased to 143 +/- 3/84 +/- 3 (doxazosin), 139 +/- 3/82 +/- 3 (captopril) and 141 +/- 3/84 + /- 1 (nifedipine) mm Hg (all p<0.01 vs. pretreatment). In conclusion, both doxazosin and captopril treatment were associated with a significant increase in GFR, while all three antihypertensive drugs caused a significant decrease in proteinuria. These results indicate that alpha-adrenergic blockers, ACE inhibitors and calcium channel antagonists can be used safely and effectively in the clinical management of non-insulin-dependent diabetics with hypertension.",0,0

Drugs for use in pregnant women are classified into 4 general categories - A through D. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established a system in 1979 that also uses the letters A through D along with an X category. However, the definitions between the FDA system and the Swedish system differ significantly, resulting in very different allocation of medicines to the respective categories. In the Swedish system, Category A includes medicines that have been used extensively and/or for which there is reliable clinical data that does not indicate any disturbance in the reproductive process. Category B includes medicinal products for which there are insufficient data from pregnant women to make a reliable estimate of the human teratogenic risk and the classification is therefore based on animal data allocated to 3 subgroups. For category C products, the pharmacological action of the drug may cause adverse effects on the human fetus or newborn. Finally, category D contains medicinal products for which human data indicate an increased incidence of malformations. The categorization statement is always followed by a short explanatory text. In contrast to the FDA system, the Swedish system is well accepted, according to a survey study of 934 doctors and pharmacists. We believe that much of America's discontent may stem from flaws in the FDA system's category definitions. The FDA system requires unrealistically high data quality, such as the availability of controlled studies in pregnant women demonstrating no risk to the fetus, in order to assign a drug to Category A. Consequently, most drugs available in the US market are assigned to category C, interpreted as ""risk cannot be excluded"". The distribution of medicines in the different categories is therefore very different between the Swedish and FDA systems. We think that the subject of this debate reflects a fundamental problem related to public health information: how should a large, composite, changing and difficult to analyze database be organized before making it available to professionals and secondarily to lay people?",0,0
1966,8857071,Lisinopril is more effective than atenolol in reducing post-workout albuminuria in primary hypertension.,,"Rangemark, C; Lind, H; Lindholm, L; Hedner, T; Samuelsson, O","Physical exertion causes transient albuminuria. The mechanisms of post-exertional albuminuria are not fully understood, but stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) probably plays an important role through intrarenal hemodynamic changes that cause increased filtration pressure. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we compared the effects of therapy with lisinopril (L) and atenolol (A) on urinary albumin excretion (UAE), ie we wanted to investigate whether inhibition of the RAS or inhibition of the beta1-adrenoceptor - The mediated effects of the sympathetic nervous system differed with respect to the changes in the UAE. Sixteen patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension were studied. Four standardized bicycle ergometer stress tests were performed before and after each active treatment period. UAE 30 min after exercise, determined by radioimmunoassay, was significantly reduced by both treatments: -278 µg center point min-1 (L) and -199 µg center point min-1 (A). The reduction in UAE post-exercise achieved by treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (L) was significantly greater than that achieved by treatment with beta1-selective adrenoceptor blockers. Blood pressure (BP) at rest and during exercise was equally reduced by both drugs. In summary, this study demonstrated that antihypertensive treatment with an ACE inhibitor was more effective in reducing exercise-induced albuminuria than a beta1-selective adrenoceptor blocker with a similar degree of blood pressure reduction in patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension. This suggests that the RAS plays a major role in post-workout albuminuria in hypertensive patients. However, the clinical significance of this finding remains to be elucidated.",0,0

One hundred and thirty-five patients (112 at completion) in NYHA Classes II-III treated with digitalis and diuretics were randomized after a 2-week placebo run-in period to receive either placebo or CLZ 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, or 2 .5 mg daily for 12 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of placebo wash-out. Hemodynamic studies, including stress testing before and 3 hours after medication, were performed on the first and last days of treatment. The measurements were carried out at rest and at the maximum load level.; In ACEI-naïve patients, oral CLZ 0.5 and 1 mg/day caused a dose-dependent decrease in PCWP and diastolic PAP and a significant decrease in SVR mg. A slight increase in CI was observed in all groups. The maximum effect was observed 3-5 hours after the dose. After 12 weeks of oral treatment, the acute response was similar but attenuated compared to the first dose. Exercise tolerance improved in a dose-dependent manner. NYHA classification remained unchanged or improved in the majority of patients. Entry into the 2.5 mg group had to be stopped early due to serious side effects observed after the first dose. During maintenance treatment, the hemodynamic response to oral cilazapril was attenuated, suggesting that the sustained clinical improvement in patients with CHF on CLZ is independent of its acute hemodynamic effects.",0,0

We wanted to confirm the differential responses to the first dose of these agents, examine the response to repeated dosing, and explore possible explanations (slow, tight binding, and steric hindrance) for the phenomenon. Forty-eight elderly patients (aged 51-85 years) with stable CHF were studied for 48 hours. Groups (n=12) received one of the following: (a) perindopril 2 mg orally (po) + placebo intravenously (iv) (day 1) and perindopril 2 mg po (day 2); (b) enalapril 2.5 mg po + placebo iv (day 1) and enalapril 2.5 mg po (day 2); (c) placebo po + perindopril 0.167 mg iv (day 1) and perindopril 2 mg po (day 2); or (d) placebo po + placebo iv (day 1) and placebo po (day 2). On day 1, blood pressure was measured in the supine position. On day 2, blood pressure was recorded by an ambulatory blood pressure monitor. Blood samples were taken at baseline and at intervals throughout the 48-hour study period for estimation of neurohumoral parameters. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was assessed by plasma ACE inhibition and also by the ratio of angiotensin II (Ang II)/Ang I + Ang II. On day I, enalapril 2.5 mg caused a greater reduction in blood pressure than placebo between 6 and 9 hours after dosing. Perindopril 2 mg produced a blood pressure response profile similar to placebo. Ambulatory blood pressure was consistently lower on day 2 with enalapril compared to perindopril. Plasma ACE inhibition profiles were similar for each active regimen. Enalapril therapy resulted in greater increases in plasma renin activity (PRA) than other treatments.

Urinary sodium excretion in response to NaCl loading was selectively increased by LD-CAP (+25%) while HD-CAP did not (+6.3%).

Cardiotropic effects have been associated with the drug, and fosinopril's compensatory dual elimination pathway via the renal and hepatic systems offers a possibility for ACE inhibitor treatment of hypertension in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Comparative studies of monotherapy with fosinopril 10 to 40 mg/day have shown antihypertensive efficacy equivalent to that of sustained-release nifedipine 40 mg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 to 50 mg/day, enalapril 5 to 10 mg/day, amlodipine 5 to 10 mg /day and sustained release verapamil 240 to 480 mg/day and better than isradipine 5 mg/day. The efficacy of combination therapy with fosinopril 10 to 20 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/day was significantly better than that of hydrochlorothiazide alone, tended to be better than that of fosinopril 20 mg/day alone, and was similar to that of sustained-release nifedipine 40 mg/day alone. The combination of fosinopril/chlorthalidone 20 to 40/25 mg/day was as effective as propranolol/chlorthalidone 80 to 160/25 mg/day. The frequency of side effects associated with fosinopril is low and cough may occur less frequently with this medicine than with other ACE inhibitors.

1972,8862965,"ACE inhibitor-induced cough and bronchospasm. Occurrence, mechanisms and management.",,"Overlack, A","dry, tickling, and often annoying cough is the most common side effect of ACE inhibitors. Recent studies show that about 10% of patients treated with ACE inhibitors may develop a cough. In half of these patients, the ACE inhibitor must be discontinued. Cough has been shown to be a class effect that occurs with all ACE inhibitors, with no clear difference between the individual substances. While ACE inhibition is safe in the vast majority of patients with obstructive pulmonary disease, asthmatic symptoms or exacerbation of asthma and an increase in bronchial reactivity have occasionally been reported. ACE inhibition increases the cough reflex. The mechanisms underlying ACE inhibitor-induced cough are likely related to suppression of kininase II activity, which may be followed by accumulation of kinins, substance P, and prostaglandins. Physicians should be aware that a dry cough is the most common side effect of ACE inhibitors and that this symptom may appear months or even a year later, not necessarily soon after starting therapy. Replacement with another ACE inhibitor should not be attempted because the cough almost always recurs on re-challenge with the same or another ACE inhibitor. After stopping the ACE inhibitor, which is the treatment of choice, the cough usually subsides within a few days.",0,0
1973,8862977,Detection of cardiovascular drug-induced depression: a symmetry analysis of the prescription sequence.,,"Hallas, J","Many cardiovascular drugs have been implicated as causes of depression. With the exception of beta-blockers, few have been studied in formal epidemiological studies. I present a new approach to such analysis that effectively controls confounders that are stable over time. I analyzed the exposure history of 11,244 antidepressant users using the Odense University PharmacoEpidemiological Database. All subjects who started both beta-blockers and antidepressants during a predefined time period were identified. If beta-blockers don't cause depression, this particular population should have an equal number of people starting both drugs first. A depression-inducing effect of beta-blockers would lead to an excess of first-timers, i.e. to an asymmetric distribution of prescription orders. Confounders that result in the two drugs being prescribed at the same time are rarely expected to affect symmetry. The initial screening revealed asymmetric prescription orders for a wide range of cardiovascular drugs. After adjusting for an increasing incidence of antidepressant prescriptions, I found a depressive effect only for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (rate ratio = 1.29; 95% confidence interval = 1.08-1.56) and calcium channel blockers ( rate ratio = 0.08-1.56). 1.31; 95% confidence interval = 1.14-1.51).

The plasma free (unesterified) cholesterol (FC) to lecithin (L) ratio, a new index of cardiovascular risk, was abnormally elevated before treatment and was not altered by either drug.; These results indicate that HCTZ and CAPT treatment have small but detectable effects on lipoprotein surface lipid composition in patients with EH restricted to the HDL2 subfraction.",0,0

QOL assessments in the hypertensive subjects and in 155 normotonic subjects included a self-structured scale measuring subjective perceptions of QOL, severity, desirability, and controllability of recent critical life events, semantic memory, physical dysfunction, sleep disturbances, sexual difficulties, and depression and work-related stress. The overall withdrawal rate during the study was 19%, mainly due to lack of efficacy and adverse experiences. At the start of the study and at the end of the study, the normotensive patients showed significantly better results in most QOL measures compared to the hypertensive patients. Patients treated with the combination of isradipine and captopril reported more favorable changes in subjective measures of QOL (P<0.03) and semantic memory (P<0.001) than patients treated with either monotherapy or methyldopa were treated in combination with captopril.

Because some once-daily agents are more effective than others in maintaining antihypertensive effects toward the end of the 24-hour dosing interval, this study was designed to evaluate the duration of the antihypertensive effect of trandolapril using 48-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in 41 patients Patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. A 24-hour ABPM was performed on two consecutive days (48 hours) after a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in period and repeated after an 8-week double-blind period in which 20 patients were randomized to treatment with trandolapril were allocated (2-4 mg once daily) and 21 patients matched placebo. During the second 48-hour monitoring period, placebo rather than active drug was taken by both groups at the beginning of the second 24-hour segment. Trandolapril reduced ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 9.4 and 6.2 mm Hg, respectively (P < or = 0.01) during the first 24 hours of the post-treatment surveillance period, while placebo reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 3.8 over the same period and 2.6 mm Hg increased (P < 0.05). During the second monitoring period (hours 25-48), trandolapril reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 5.6 and 3.9 mm Hg, while placebo increased blood pressure by 2.3 and 1.6 mm Hg (P<0.03) . Compared to placebo in 2-hour blocks, trandolapril produced clinically significant decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure for 30 and 28 hours post-dose during the 2 days of monitoring.

Patients then received enalapril 5 mg twice daily (n=42) or 20 mg twice daily (n=41) in a random order. Thus, in patients randomized to low doses of enalapril, there was virtually no change in therapy from baseline through 48 weeks. Forty-three patients (52%) completed the study, 19 low-dose and 24 high-dose patients. Both doses affected survival equally with 15 (18%) deaths, eight at low dose and seven at high dose. At 48 weeks, functional capacity by New York Heart Association class improved more with the high dose than with the low dose (p=0.04). In contrast, changes in invasive hemodynamic variables at rest and exercise, and maximal exercise capacity were comparable in both groups. Diastolic blood pressure decreased and the change between both groups was statistically significant (p = 0.01). Changes in plasma creatinine levels did not differ between high and low dose treatment, and no patient had to be discontinued for worsening renal function. In terms of neurohumoral activity, a tendency towards differential response to both treatments was observed, with a blunt increase in norepinephrine at high vs. low doses of enalapril.

After a 2-week washout period, patients with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 120 mmHg received trandolapril 2 mg once daily for 4 weeks. Both at the end of the washout period and at the end of the treatment period, four-day self-recorded blood pressures were performed with a device equipped with an automatic printer using the oscillometric method (A&D UA 751). Each day, before taking the medication, a series of three consecutive measurements was planned in the morning and repeated in the evening. A total of 1710 patients (946 men, 764 women) aged 56 +/- 11 years participated in the study. In the 816 patients who performed self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) correctly in both periods and followed the protocol schedule, office-based blood pressure (SBP/DBP) decreased from 166.4 +/- 15/101.4 +/- 6 mmHg to 144.7 +/- 6 mm Hg. - 14/86.1 +/- 8 mm Hg, while the SMBP from 153 +/- 18/94 +/- 10 mm Hg to 139 +/- 16/85 + /- 10 mm Hg decreased. A weak correlation was found between the two methods in terms of systolic (r = 0.47, p < 0.0001) and diastolic (r = 0.36, p < 0.0001) blood pressure reduction. Individual response to therapy varied between the two methods: 633 patients (77.6%) had a DBP drop of at least 10 mm Hg, while 493 (60.4%) had a DBP drop of at least 6 mm Hg in the evening ; 65% of patients were considered responders by both methods.

In 15 renal transplant patients immunosuppressed with AZA and prednisone (enalapril in 14 and captopril in 1), ACEI was replaced with nifedipine or clonidine. AZA metabolites, renal function parameters, and haematological parameters including erythropoietin and reticulocytes were assessed before and for 10 to 12 weeks after ACEI discontinuation. Enalaprilat levels were measured and compared to 15 similar patients matched for graft function and enalapril dosing who were immunosuppressed with cyclosporine and prednisone. AZA metabolites did not differ significantly in the presence or absence of ACEI. The enalaprilat levels also showed no significant difference between the two patient groups treated with AZA or ciclosporin. Hematocrit and hemoglobin increased significantly from 37.5 +/- 6.4 to 39.7 +/- 3.6% (mean +/- SD, P=0.02) and 12.8 +/- 2.2, respectively to 13.5 +/- 1.2 g/dl, P=0.04, 10 to 12 weeks after discontinuation of ACEI treatment. At the same time, the number of reticulocytes and the erythropoietin concentration increased significantly after 2, 4 and 10 weeks, with a peak after two weeks (from 14.1 +/- 3.8 to 20.6 +/- 8.0/1000 , P<0.05 and from 14.3 +/- 12.4 to 29.3 +/- 54.5 mU/mL, P<0.05). In conclusion, ACEI-related anemia in renal transplant recipients appears to be due to the erythropoietin-lowering effects of this class of drugs. A pharmacokinetic interaction between AZA and enalapril is unlikely since enalaprilat plasma levels were independent of immunosuppressive therapy and AZA metabolite levels remained unchanged in the presence and absence of ACEI. Several mechanisms by which angiotensin-converting enzyme blockade may cause a decrease in circulating erythropoietin are discussed.",0,0

Platelet aggregation induced by adrenaline in vitro decreased significantly during treatment with HCT2, the threshold increased to 10 micromolar compared to 1.0 with placebo (P<0.05) at rest, and the threshold for aggregation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP ) also increased from 2 micromoles to 4 (NS). Resting plasma PF4 fell, although not significantly, from placebo from 3.28 to 2.56 ng/mL during HCT2 treatment. During treatment with spirapril, neither adrenaline nor ADP thresholds for aggregation of platelets collected at rest changed, and plasma PF4 levels showed no significant reductions at rest. However, under exercise, PF4 showed an approximate doubling of the resting value independent of the therapy. This exercise-induced increase in PF4 was significantly reduced (p<0.05) by spirapril compared to placebo. ECLT and t-PA did not change significantly from placebo levels during any therapy. PAI-1 did not change during spirapril therapy, but during treatment with HCT2 it fell, albeit not significantly, to 9.36 IU/mL from 15.91 on placebo (NS). Spirapril and HCT2 produced no undesirable side effects on platelet function or fibrinolysis. HCT2 appears to decrease resting platelet activity, while spirapril appears to decrease exercise platelet activity to some extent.",0,0

Patients in the losartan arm (n=97) initially received oral (PO) 50 mg losartan once daily (QD); The drug could be titrated to 50 mg losartan/12.5 mg HCTZ po d at 4 weeks, followed by 50 mg losartan plus 25 mg HCTZ po d at 8 weeks if needed. Patients in the amlodipine group (n=93) received amlodipine 5 mg po QD, which could be titrated to 10 mg po QD at 4 weeks, followed by 10 mg plus 25 mg HCTZ po QD at 8 weeks. Medication was titrated up as needed to achieve trough SiDBP < 90 mm Hg. Efficacy, tolerability, and quality of life were assessed after 12 weeks of therapy with each regimen. The SiDBP depressions after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of therapy were clinically comparable (losartan group: 7.3, 10.4 and 11.1 mm Hg; amlodipine group: 7.9, 11.2 and 11, 8mmHg). Similar reductions in systolic blood pressure were also observed for both treatment groups. The percentage of patients achieving target SiDBP (defined as trough SiDBP < 90 mm Hg or SiDBP > or = 90 mm Hg with a decrease of > or = 10 mm Hg from placebo baseline) was 68% of patients in both groups achieved the goal comparable to the losartan group and 71% of the patients in the amlodipine group. Significantly more patients in the amlodipine group had drug-related adverse events (27% vs. 13%). In particular, drug-related edema occurred more frequently in patients receiving the amlodipine regimen than in patients receiving the losartan regimen (11% vs. 1%). Patients in the amlodipine arm reported significantly more discomfort due to edema, regardless of whether edema was present at baseline, than patients in the losartan arm (12% vs. 2%), although overall quality of life did not differ between the two treatment groups. This study shows that therapy with losartan and HCTZ added as needed compared to therapy with amlodipine with HCTZ added as needed provides comparable efficacy and superior tolerability and is less disruptive to patients in terms of edema.",0,0

Orlistat was administered for 7 (nifedipine and captopril) or 8 days (atenolol and furosemide) in doses of 50 mg 3 times a day during meals. The four antihypertensive drugs (atenolol 100 mg tablet, furosemide 40 mg tablet, captopril 50 mg tablet and nifedipine 20 mg prolonged-release tablet) were administered in single doses twice, once before and once together, with orlistat at the end of the orlistat treatment period.; The plasma concentration-time profiles and the estimated pharmacokinetic parameters of these medicinal products were within the expected range, with the exception of furosemide, for which the bioavailability was lower than reported in the literature. This was probably because furosemide was given during a meal. There were slight but statistically significant differences in one of the pharmacokinetic parameters of furosemide and nifedipine (no difference for captopril and atenolol) when these drugs were given alone and in combination with orlistat: the half-life of furosemide was slightly longer the time to reach peak plasma concentrations of nifedipine was slightly longer. None of these are considered clinically significant changes.; The lipase inhibitor orlistat at a dose of 50 mg three times a day does not change the pharmacokinetics of atenolol, furosemide, nifedipine and captopril to a clinically significant extent.",0,0

The effect of ACE inhibition on diabetic nephropathy showed that captopril reduced the rate of renal failure, end stage renal disease (ESRD) and death in patients with IDDM and nephropathy. The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of captopril as a therapy in patients with IDDM and the potential savings for all patients with diabetes and nephropathy.; We used the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled study comparing captopril (207 patients) to placebo (202 patients), the purpose of which was to determine whether captopril has renal-protective properties independent of its effect on blood pressure in diabetic nephropathy to create a model medical management of patients prior to progression to ESRD. To model disease progression after progression to ESRD and to extend the model to patients with NIDDM, we used data from the US Renal Data System and published literature. Medical resource cost data was based primarily on Medicare reimbursement levels, published wholesale drug prices, and surveys of healthcare providers. The economic model uses a payer perspective to estimate direct costs. The costs to society (indirect costs) associated with lost patient productivity due to ESRD were also estimated. Using this information, we projected the annual and lifetime costs when patients with IDDM and NIDDM and overt nephropathy were treated with either placebo or captopril. We also constructed a model of the overall prevalence of diabetic nephropathy to estimate aggregate savings in total US health care spending.; Treatment with captopril resulted in absolute direct cost savings or benefits of $32,550 per patient with IDDM over a lifetime compared to treatment with placebo. For patients with NIDDM, direct cost savings totaled $9,900 per patient. Absolute savings were also seen in indirect costs: $84,390 per patient with IDDM and $45,730 per patient with NIDDM. If captopril therapy were started in 1995 for patients with either IDDM or NIDDM and nephropathy, the total healthcare cost savings (ie, direct cost savings alone) would be $189 million per year for 1999 and $475 million per year in 2004, the present The value of cumulative healthcare cost savings over those 10 years would be $2.4 billion.

Losartan, the first in a new class of drugs called angiotensin II receptor antagonists, can be administered as monotherapy to treat high blood pressure or as an adjunct to existing therapy. The angiotensin II receptor antagonists block the action of angiotensin II by preferentially binding to the angiotensin II receptor subtype AT1 on the cell membrane. Compared to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, they can provide more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and are associated with a lower incidence of cough as an adverse reaction.",0,0

Participants had an ejection fraction < 0.35 and either symptomatic CHF (treatment study, n=2465) or asymptomatic CHF (prevention study, n=2560). Baseline assessment of HRQL predicted mortality and CHF-related hospitalizations in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients randomized to receive enalapril and placebo.

Patients continued on their previous regimens, which included an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a loop diuretic with or without digitalis. Patients were randomized to one of 5 parallel treatment groups: placebo or spironolactone in a single daily dose of 12.5, 25, 50 or 75 mg for 12 weeks. Serum levels of creatinine, urea nitrogen, potassium, plasma renin activity and N-terminal proatrial natriuretic factor (pro-ANF), and urinary aldosterone levels were measured regularly. Measurements after 12 weeks compared to baseline showed a significant increase in plasma renin activity and aldosterone excretion, and a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pro-ANF. Hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.4 mmol/L) occurred in 10% of the placebo-treated patients and 0.5% of the spironolactone group. The incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > or = 5.5 mmol/L) was 5% in the placebo group while it was 5%, 13%, 20%, and 12.5, 25, 50, and 75 in the 12.5, 25, 50, and 75 groups, respectively 24% was -mg spironolactone treatment groups. Predictors of hyperkalemia included use of ACE inhibitors other than captopril, ACE inhibitor dose, and increase in serum creatinine or potassium levels at baseline.

2003,8891468,lisinopril. A review of the pharmacology and clinical efficacy in early management of acute myocardial infarction.,,"Goa, K L; Balfour, J A; Zuanetti, G","After demonstrating its efficacy in hypertension and congestive heart failure, the ACE inhibitor lisinopril has now been shown to reduce mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with myocardial infarction when given as early treatment. Lisinopril's ability to attenuate the adverse effects of left ventricular remodeling is a key mechanism; However, it is postulated that additional cardioprotective and vasculoprotective effects play a role in mediating the early benefit. The GISSI-3 study of >19,000 patients demonstrated that lisinopril (with or without nitrates) when given orally within 24 hours of onset of symptoms and continued for 6 weeks confers measurable survival benefits within 1 to 2 days of initiating treatment . There was an 11% reduction in risk of mortality and a 7.7% reduction in a composite endpoint (death plus severe left ventricular dysfunction) after 6 weeks compared to no treatment with lisinopril. Benefits were evident in all types of patients. Thus, those at high risk—women, the elderly, patients with diabetes mellitus, and patients with anterior infarction and/or Killip class >1—also benefited. These increases in composite endpoint events were sustained over time, although treatment was discontinued in most patients after 6 weeks. At 6 months, the incidence rate for the composite endpoint remained lower than the control group (a 6.2% reduction). The GISSI-3 results are consistent with those from recent large studies (ISIS-4, CCS-1, SMILE) of other ACE inhibitors as early treatment for myocardial infarction. However, the results of the CONSENSUS II study (intravenous enalaprilat then oral enalapril) were unfavorable in some patients. These findings, along with the development of sustained hypotension and, to a lesser extent, renal dysfunction in patients in the GISSI-3 study, have sparked considerable debate about optimal treatment strategies. Current opinion generally assumes that therapy with lisinopril or other ACE inhibitors shown to be beneficial can be started within 24 hours in haemodynamically stable patients with no other contraindications; Current labeling in the US and other countries reflects this position. There is a general consensus that such therapy is indicated in high-risk patients, particularly those with left ventricular dysfunction. The choice of ACE inhibitor appears to be less important than the decision to treat; it seems likely that these advantages are a class effect. Lisinopril has a tolerability profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors, can be administered once daily, and may be less expensive than other members of its class. However, current cost analyzes are flawed and the latter points have yet to be demonstrated in formal cost-benefit analyses. In conclusion, early treatment with lisinopril (within 24 hours of symptom onset) for 6 weeks improves survival and reduces cardiovascular morbidity in patients with myocardial infarction and provides sustained benefit after drug discontinuation. While patients with symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction are prime candidates for treatment, any patient who is hemodynamically stable and has no other contraindications is also a candidate for therapy. Lisinopril and other ACE inhibitors that have been shown to be beneficial should therefore be considered as an integral part of early management of myocardial infarction in eligible patients.",0,0

After clinical, radiological and radionuclide examination, each patient underwent right heart catheterization (Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter). Plasma norepinephrine levels were measured. No favorable hemodynamic response to L-Dopa was observed in two patients, and two others required permanent pacemaker implantation. These four patients were excluded from the study. Two patients required permanent pacemaker implantation.

Ibopamine exerts hemodynamic and neurohumoral effects and is beneficial in mild heart failure; however, its added value in more advanced disease is unclear.; The study was a self-contained, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group comparison of ibopamine (100 mg tid) and placebo in 59 patients with New York Heart Association Class III-IV heart failure. Patients were clinically stable on medication including an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and were randomized to receive ibopamine (n=29) or placebo (n=30). Assessments were conducted at baseline and after 3 months of treatment and included measurement of maximal oxygen consumption, plasma neurohormones, ambulatory arrhythmias and heart rate variability. At baseline, the two groups were well matched, including age (mean 63 years), left ventricular ejection fraction (0.23), and peak oxygen consumption (15.4 mL/min/kg). After 3 months, four patients had withdrawn from the study because of progressive heart failure (ibopamine, n=1; placebo, n=3; not significant) and two because of side effects (n=1/1). Exercise time and maximal oxygen consumption were not significantly affected (exercise time: ibopamine, +54 [95% confidence interval, -12, 120] seconds; placebo, +19 [-42, 81] seconds; maximal oxygen consumption: ibopamine, +0.3 [- 0.5, 1.2] mL/min/kg; placebo, +0.2 [-0.7, 1.0] mL/min/kg).

This approach does not necessarily detect the rare adverse events that may only be seen when examining very large numbers of patients. Consequently, we designed a double-blind 12-week study comparing the new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril (n=5,053), with an established beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, metoprolol (n=506). Significantly hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure 95-114 mmHg) received either quinapril 10 mg or metoprolol 50 mg once daily, and the doses were doubled at 4-week intervals to a maximum of 40 and 200 mg, respectively, in non-responders. Response rates were similar under both regimens. Adverse events were assessed both through interviews and through a standard questionnaire. The overall prevalence of adverse events reported in the standard questionnaire was higher than those reported spontaneously in interviews. With regard to typical ACE inhibitor side effects (e.g. cough and taste disorders), there was no difference between quinapril and metoprolol, regardless of the reporting mode. In summary, both drugs showed comparable overall tolerability and safety. Of note was the discrepancy between spontaneously reported and questionnaire-reported adverse events, and this finding predominated in a volunteer group of 327 patients treated with quinapril for 52 weeks. Therefore, in addition to the anamnesis/questioning, a questionnaire is of great importance in a large-scale double-blind study in order to find out details about drug safety.",0,0

To investigate the association between this interlead variation (QT dispersion) and left ventricular hypertrophy, we subjected 100 untreated subjects to 12-lead electrocardiography and echocardiography. In addition, 24 previously untreated subjects underwent a 6-month treatment study with ramipril and felodipine. In the cross-sectional portion of the study, heart rate-corrected QT dispersion (QTc dispersion) correlated significantly with left ventricular mass index (r = 0.30, P < 0.01), systolic pressure (r = 0.30, P < 0 ,01). .01), the ratio of the peak flow velocity of the early filling wave to the peak flow velocity of the atrial wave (E/A ratio) (r = -.22, P = .02), isovolumic relaxation time (r = .31 , P < 0.01) and age (r=0.21, P<0.04). In the treatment portion of the study, lead-corrected QTc dispersion decreased from 24 to 19 milliseconds after treatment and remained at 19 milliseconds after a subsequent 2-week drug washout (P<0.01). The changes in left ventricular mass index at these stages were 144, 121, and 124 g/m2 (p<0.01). Systolic pressure decreased from 175 to 144 mm Hg and increased again to 164 mm Hg after drug washout (P<0.01). The E/A ratio (0.97, 1.02, and 1.02; P=69) and isovolumic relaxation time (111, 112, and 112; P=0.97) remained unchanged across the three assessment points. In summary, QT dispersion is associated with increased left ventricular mass index in hypertensive subjects. Antihypertensive therapy with ramipril and felodipine lowered both parameters. If increased QT dispersion is a predictor of sudden death in this population, then the importance of its reduction is obvious.",0,0
2008,8902551,Discontinuation of prolonged ramipril treatment in patients with hypertension: effects on the renin-angiotensin system.,,"Stephan, D; Grima, M; Welsch, M; Barthelmebs, M; Vasmant, D; Imbs, J","The increase in renin secretion and converting enzyme (ACE) induction observed during treatment with ACE inhibitors (CEIs) could lead to increased synthesis of angiotensin II (Ang II) when treatment is stopped. The aim of this study was to compare changes in the components of the renin-angiotensin system with changes in arterial pressure in hypertensive patients after cessation of long-term ramipril treatment. Twenty hypertensive subjects treated with ramipril monotherapy for at least 3 months in the past 3 weeks were randomly assigned to two parallel groups and received either placebo (withdrawal group W, n=12) or ramipril at the previous doses for fifteen days ( treated group T, n=8). Blood pressure was measured using four different techniques. Plasma concentrations of active renin (AR), angiotensinogen, angiotensin I (Ang I), angiotensin II (Ang II), and aldosterone were measured, as was plasma angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) activity in vitro (colorimetric and fluorometric method) and in vivo (the Ang II/Ang I ratio). The biological effects of discontinuation of long-term treatment with ramipril in hypertensive patients were a decrease in AR and angiotensin I concentrations, an increase in ACE activity and no significant changes in angiotensinogen, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels. Fifteen days after discontinuation, various parameters of the renin-angiotensin system appear to have returned to baseline. A slow increase in blood pressure was also observed, but no rebound increase was seen in either angiotensin II levels or blood pressure over the 15 days. After discontinuation of prolonged ramipril treatment, in vivo converting enzyme inhibition slowly disappears, probably due to slow inhibition of tight binding of ramiprilat, the active metabolite of this CEI. The gradual decrease in AF plasma levels along with the prolonged ACE inhibition, measured in vivo by the Ang II/Ang I ratio, explains the lack of an increase in Ang II synthesis.",0,0

The most important evaluation criteria were the diastolic blood pressure and the serum potassium concentration. Equivalence was assessed on an intention-to-treat basis using the Schuirmann method, which performs two one-tailed statistical tests on the data. 35 patients were withdrawn from the study, but there were no differences between the groups in the reasons for withdrawal.; Diastolic blood pressure decreased by 13.1 to 14.2 mmHg in the three groups. The 90% confidence intervals for the differences between perindopril + indapamide and the other treatments were -1.1, +1.7 mmHg for captopril + hydrochlorothiazide and -0.4, +2.6 mmHg for enalapril + hydrochlorothiazide. The Schuirmann test was highly statistically significant (P < 0.001 for perindopril + indapamide versus captopril + hydrochlorothiazide; P < 0.002 for perindopril + indapamide versus enalapril + hydrochlorothiazide), so that the two one-sided hypotheses that the treatments were not equivalent were finally rejected were nominal level of alpha = 0.05. Likewise, the safety of the treatments in terms of serum potassium was equivalent. The 90% confidence intervals of the differences between perindopril + indapamide and the other treatments were -8.7, -1.6% for captopril + hydrochlorothiazide (p=0.004) and -1.5, +2.7% for enalapril + hydrochlorothiazide (p<0.001).; We conclude that the safety and efficacy of perindopril + indapamide, captopril + hydrochlorothiazide, and enalapril + hydrochlorothiazide were equivalent after 8 weeks of treatment in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.",0,0

PROGRESS Management Committee [corrected].,,"Neal, B; MacMahon, S","Patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease are at very high risk of stroke, and common values of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure are directly and continuously associated with this risk. Studies of blood pressure reduction in patients with transient ischemic attack or stroke have been too small to reliably assess the impact of modest blood pressure reductions achieved on stroke risk.; PROGRESS' primary objective is to accurately determine the impact of blood pressure lowering with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-based regimen on stroke risk in patients with a history of transient ischemic attacks or mild stroke.; The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. There is a 4-week run-in period with open-label ACE inhibitor treatment prior to randomization. The planned duration of treatment and follow-up is 4-5 years.; The study will be conducted at collaborating clinical centers in Australia, Belgium, the People's Republic of China, France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom.; The study will enroll 6000 patients with a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) within the last 5 years. To be eligible, patients should have no clear indication or contraindication for treatment with an ACE inhibitor and no disability that is likely to prevent regular attendance at the study clinics.; Study treatment includes perindopril and indapamide or matched placebo for patients with no indication or contraindication for treatment with a diuretic, perindopril alone or matched placebo for all other patients.; The primary outcome of the study is the total number of strokes and the secondary outcomes include fatal or disabling strokes, total number of major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular deaths, cognitive functioning and dementia, and disability and dependence.",1,0

Thirty-one diabetics with a sustained urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) of 20-200 µg min-1 were randomized to receive indapamide 2.5 mg or captopril 37.5 mg daily for 12 weeks. After a 4-week washout, patients received the alternative agent for 12 weeks. Resting blood pressure (BP), AER, cholesterol, triglycerides, and HbA1c were measured at baseline, after 6 and 12 weeks of each treatment, and after a 4-week washout period after each treatment arm. Results from patients who completed at least one treatment arm were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The AER (median and interquartile range) decreased significantly from baseline after treatment with indapamide and captopril [60 (27-106) vs. 40 (14-112) and 33 (17-100); p<0.005], but there was no difference between the effects of the two drugs. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was also significantly reduced by the treatment, and no difference was found between the effects of the two agents. No correlation was found between changes in AER and SBP for either agent. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP), cholesterol, triglycerides and HbA1c did not change during the study. These results suggest that indapamide is an effective alternative to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of diabetics with microalbuminuria.",0,0

2020,8914031,Calcium channel blockers versus other antihypertensive therapies in the progression of NIDDM-associated nephropathy.,,"Bakris, G L; Copley, J B; Vicknair, N; Sadler, R; Leurgans, S","Treatment of hypertension with ACE inhibitors in diabetics reduces proteinuria and slows the progression of nephropathy compared to agents that do not maintain a reduction in proteinuria. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have variable effects on proteinuria; their long-term effects on the progression of diabetic nephropathy are unknown. The current study tests the hypothesis that CCBs that maintain a reduction in proteinuria slow the progression of nephropathy associated with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) to a degree comparable to ACE inhibitors when a similar level of blood pressure control is available. To test this hypothesis, we randomized 52 patients with NIDDM-associated nephropathy and hypertension, mean age 63 +/- 8 years, to either the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril (N=18), non-dihydropyridine CCBs (NDCCBs), verapamil SR (N=8) or diltiazem SR (N=10) or the beta-blocker atenolol (N=16). Target BP was < or = 140/90 mm Hg. Patients were followed for a median of 63 +/- 7 months. The primary endpoint was the change in creatinine clearance (CCr) slope in each group. There was no significant difference in mean arterial pressure reduction between groups during the study period (p=0.14). The mean rate of decrease in CCr was greatest in the atenolol group (-3.48 mL/min/year/1.73 m2; p<0.0001). There was no difference in CCr slopes between the lisinopril and NDCCBs groups (p=0.36). Proteinuria was reduced to a similar extent in the lisinopril and NDCCBs groups (p > 0.99). Therefore, in subjects with renal impairment secondary to NIDDM, similar levels of blood pressure control with either lisinopril or NDCCBs slowed the progression of renal disease to a greater extent than atenolol. In addition, this enhanced slowing of kidney disease progression was correlated with a sustained and significant reduction in proteinuria, findings not observed in the atenolol group.",0,0

The cooperative study group.,,"Breyer, J A; Bain, R P; Evans, J K; Nahman, N S; Lewis, E J; Cooper, M; McGill, J; Berl, T","We designed a prospective, double-blind, controlled study to determine predictors of loss of renal function in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and established nephropathy. A total of 409 insulin-dependent diabetics with documented nephropathy participated in a study of the effect of captopril on the rate of kidney disease progression. Demographic, baseline clinical (medical history and physical), and laboratory parameters were analyzed as risk factors for time to progression. Dichotomous features were compared using Fisher's exact test and continuous features using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Univariate proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of nephropathy progression and bivariate proportional hazards regression to identify interactions with treatment group assignment. Multivariate proportional hazards regression was used to determine which characteristics were independent risk factors. We found that a number of demographic and clinical characteristics were significantly associated with nephropathy progression, even after adjustment for treatment group. However, after multivariate analysis, the risk factors that independently predicted progression were onset of IDDM later in life, parental diagnosis of IDDM, presence of edema, elevated mean arterial pressure, and abnormal electrocardiogram. Likewise, a number of laboratory features were also predictive of the progression of nephropathy. Low hematocrit, high blood glucose, and higher protein excretion predicted progression of nephropathy, as did higher serum creatinine, particularly in the face of normal serum albumin. In summary, this study identifies a set of clinical and laboratory risk factors that may predict which patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and established nephropathy are more likely to experience a clinically meaningful decline in renal function over a median follow-up of three years.",0,0

ACE inhibitors have been shown to decrease left ventricular dilation after myocardial infarction. In the GISSI-3 study, patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of myocardial infarction symptoms to 6 weeks of treatment with lisinopril, nitroglycerin, both or neither in an open-label, 2 x 2 factorial design. The study showed that early treatment with lisinopril reduced mortality at 6 weeks and severe left ventricular dysfunction in relatively unselected patients. We assessed (1) the prognostic value of pre-discharge 2-D echocardiographic variables and (2) the effects of lisinopril on the progression of left ventricular dilatation.; Pre-discharge 2-D echocardiograms were available from 8619 GISSI-3 study patients who were discharged alive. In 6405 of these patients, a 2-D echocardiography examination was also available at 6 weeks and 6 months. Pre-discharge end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and ejection fraction predicted 6-month mortality and nonfatal clinical congestive heart failure (P < 0.01). The increase in left ventricular volume over time was significantly reduced by > or = 27% by 6 weeks of treatment with lisinopril in patients with wall motion asynergia before discharge. Patients with wall motion asynergy <27% showed no dilatation at 6 months and lisinopril did not affect volume. Patients randomized to lisinopril continued to have lower volumes after stopping treatment at 6 weeks. Lisinopril had no effect on left ventricular ejection fraction.; 2-D echocardiography independently contributes to pre-discharge risk stratification for 6-month mortality and clinical heart failure after myocardial infarction, and early short-course treatment with lisinopril in unselected myocardial infarction patients attenuates left ventricular dilatation; an effect evident in patients with larger infarcts.

In addition, activation of the renin-angiotensin system is common in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. In theory, administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can improve sodium and water retention in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. In this study, we evaluate the role of low-dose captopril on changes in renal function, renal plasma flow, and hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Fifty patients will be randomly assigned to captopril or placebo for 14 days. Renal function, renal plasma flow, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone concentration, and systemic and hepatic hemodynamics will be measured before and after treatment. Our results show that placebo administration did not affect any of the parameters measured in this study. The finding that low-dose captopril significantly increases plasma renin activity suggests that the dose used in this study effectively blocks the enzyme activity. However, low-dose captopril does not affect renal plasma flow, renal function, and systemic and hepatic hemodynamics. The results of this study indicate that inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme alone may not improve sodium and water retention in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.",0,0

Effects of antihypertensive therapy.,,"Alli, C; Lombardo, M; Zanni, D; Agrati, A M; Cassani, M; Granata, S","The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an ACE inhibitor (fosinopril) and a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) on urinary albumin and transferrin excretion and their relationship to blood pressure in essential hypertension. Twenty-four treatment-naïve patients (mean age 46.4 +/- 8.9 years) with diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 114 mmHg and normal renal function were randomized to receive amlodipine or fosinopril and, if diastolic blood pressure failed to normalize, doxazosin was added to therapy added. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and 24-hour urine collection for albumin and transferrin measurements were performed before and after 3 and 6 months of therapy. Diastolic blood pressure normalized in 23 patients (96%). Before treatment, 50% of the patients had microalbuminuria. In the amlodipine and fosinopril group, antihypertensive therapy significantly reduced blood pressure and albuminuria only in the fosinopril group. Transferrinuria did not change significantly in either group. Fosinopril reduced albuminuria in all patients, compared to amlodipine in only half of the patients. Albuminuria, but not transferrinuria, correlated significantly with ambulatory blood pressure. This correlation was more pronounced for systolic pressure than for diastolic pressure. A high prevalence of microalbuminuria can be observed in patients with essential hypertension and normal renal function. Albuminuria appears to correlate with ambulatory blood pressure, particularly systolic blood pressure. Intrarenal hemodynamic changes appear to play a more important role in reducing albuminuria than systemic blood pressure reduction.

2028,8932538,Losartan: First in a new class of angiotensin antagonists for the treatment of high blood pressure.,,"Carr, A A; Prisant, L M","Angiotensin receptor antagonists represent a new class of drugs for the treatment of patients with hypertension. Lowering blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension requires increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system. Losartan, the first orally active, non-peptide angiotensin antagonist, specifically competes with angiotensin II (Ang II) for the AT1 receptor and reversibly alters the receptor. Maximum blood pressure reductions occur after doses of about 50 mg, although some patients require 100 mg; The parent compound and a metabolite are responsible for a smooth 24-hour effect on blood pressure. Losartan once daily has been documented as safe. The safety of the drug was evaluated in 4,058 patients; of these patients, more than 1,200 were treated for more than 6 months and more than 800 for more than 1 year with doses ranging from 10 mg to 150 mg. Overall, no hypertensive patients were discontinued from treatment because of increased serum creatinine or potassium levels, and there were no reports of angioedema. In addition, some reductions in plasma uric acid levels have been noted. Cough occurred significantly less frequently in patients treated with losartan than in patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide or lisinopril.

Many drugs, particularly thiol drugs, have been shown to induce in vitro acantholysis through biochemical mechanisms that interfere with the balance of disulfide and thiol groups. In the case of nonthiol drugs, the pathomechanism of acantholysis is still unclear.; To elucidate the molecular mechanism of enalapril-induced acantholysis, a possible association between transglutaminase (TGase) activity and the effects of this drug was investigated.; TGase activity in human breast skin extracts cultured in the presence of thiopronine, captopril and enalapril was assessed in vitro. The acantholytic potential of cystamine, a known TGase inhibitor, was also studied.; Enalapril, the most potent acantholytic drug in vitro, was found to inhibit both purified enzyme and TGase activity in extracts from cultured human breast skin explants. Kinetic studies showed that the inhibition of enalapril was competitive for the amino-acceptor substrate and non-competitive for the amino-donor substrate. In addition, an acantholytic effect of cystamine on normal human skin explants has been demonstrated.; These results suggest that acantholysis and inhibition of TGase activity might be two related phenomena.",0,0
2031,8948517,The benefits of ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers in slowing the progression of renal failure: focus on fixed-dose antihypertensive combination therapy.,,"Epstein, M","Over the past two decades, major research interest has focused on the determinants of chronic kidney disease and interventions to delay the inexorable progression of end-stage renal disease. Recent studies have provided a theoretical framework for suggesting that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and possibly calcium antagonists may preferentially delay the progression of kidney disease. While the majority of available clinical studies have evaluated the effects of ACE inhibitors in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), there are relatively few long-term studies that have evaluated the renal protective effects of ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers in patients with nondiabetic kidney disease. Although clinical trials have started with both of these classes of drugs as monotherapy, theoretical considerations suggest that fixed-dose combinations of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist may be attractive as renal protectants. Several lines of evidence suggest that the renal microcirculatory effects of co-administration of both agents should be complementary. Similarly, recent observations suggest that the two classes may act in a complementary manner to counteract pathogenetic mechanisms at the mesangial level. A recent study in patients with type II diabetes showed that combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker produced the greatest reduction in proteinuria and reduced the rate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline more than either agent alone at the same level lowering blood pressure. Based on such considerations, randomized prospective studies have recently been initiated to compare the renal protective effects of a combination therapy of calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors with monotherapy with agents from one of these two antihypertensive classes.",0,0
2032,8952600,Influence of angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene polymorphism on the effects of perindopril and nitrendipine on arterial stiffness in hypertensive subjects.,,"Benetos, A; Cambien, F; Gautier, S; Ricard, S; Safar, M; Laurent, S; Lacolley, P; Poirier, O; Topouchian, J; Asmar, R","Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors improve arterial stiffness independent of blood pressure reduction. Since we have recently shown that the A1166C angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) polymorphism is an independent determinant of aortic stiffness in hypertensive patients, we designed the present study to investigate the influence of this polymorphism on the changes of aortic stiffness after chronic treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril and the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine. 40 people with hypertension treated with perindopril and 42 with nitrendipine were examined. We assessed aortic stiffness by measuring carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Carriers of the AT1-RC allele had higher baseline pulse wave velocity values than AA homozygotes (P<0.05). In the perindopril group, a three-fold greater decrease in pulse wave velocity was observed in C allele carriers than in AA homozygotes (-2.85 +/- 0.62 and -0.94 +/- 0.32 m/s, respectively ;p<0.001). , while in the nitrendipine group, pulse wave velocity decreased only in AA homozygotes and not in AT1-RC carriers (-1.38 +/- 0.35 versus +0.04 +/- 0.60 m/s; P < 0.01). These results indicate that according to the AT1-R A1166C genotype, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker affect pulse wave velocity in opposite ways. Because some evidence suggests that increased pulse wave velocity may increase cardiovascular risk, it may be helpful for physicians to consider the AT1-R genotype when prescribing an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium channel blocker to a person with hypertension .",0,0
2033,8957033,The impact of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on renal tubular function in progressive chronic nephropathy.,,"Kamper, A L; Holstein-Rathlou, N H; Leyssac, P P; Strandgaard, S","The impact of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on renal tubular function in progressive chronic nephropathy was studied in 69 patients using the lithium clearance (C(Li)) method. During a controlled study of the effect of enalapril on the progression of renal failure, repeated studies were conducted for up to 2 years. The pattern of proteinuria was followed over the first 9 months. At baseline, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ranged from 5 to 68 mL/min. The absolute proximal tubular fluid reabsorption rate (APR), estimated as the difference between GFR and C(Li), ranged from 1 to 54 mL/min. The calculated fractional proximal reabsorption (FPR) was moderately subnormal. During the study, GFR decreased and sodium clearance remained unchanged; fractional sodium excretion therefore increased. In the group of patients randomized to treatment with enalapril (n=34), GFR was 83% (P<0.001) and C(Li) 88% (P<0.01) of baseline values at 1 month , the APR and FPR had not changed significantly and the potassium clearance was significantly decreased. During the rest of the study period, the APR in the enalapril group remained almost unchanged and the FPR even increased. In the group of patients randomized to conventional antihypertensive therapy (n=35), C(Li) remained unchanged until the severe reduction in GFR, APR, and FPR gradually wore off, and potassium clearance remained almost unchanged. These differences in tubular function between the two treatment regimens were significant (P<0.05). An unchanged or increased APR in both regimens was associated with a slower long-term progression of renal failure. Over 9 months, the 24-hour fractional clearance of albumin decreased in the ACE inhibitor group (p<0.01), while the clearance of immunoglobulin G and retinol-binding protein remained unchanged in this group. In the conventional group, the fractional clearances of these three plasma proteins were all increased. It is concluded that in progressive chronic nephropathy, treatment with ACE inhibitors was associated with differential adaptive tubular changes in sodium, water and protein handling compared to conventional antihypertensive therapy. During ACE inhibition, proximal tubule reabsorption seemed to be better preserved, which may be important for the beneficial effect of this treatment in chronic kidney disease.",0,0
2034,8957034,"Effect of ramipril on blood pressure and protein excretion rate in normotensive, nondiabetic patients with proteinuria.",,"Toto, R D; Adams-Huet, B; Fenves, A Z; Mitchell, H C; Mulcahy, W; Smith, R D","Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce proteinuria in both normotensive and hypertensive patients with proteinuric kidney disease. However, the mechanism of the antiproteinuric effect has not been elucidated. We conducted a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study to test the hypothesis that the antiproteinuric effect of ramipril is due to an improvement in glomerular permselectivity independent of blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate. The effect of low-dose (1.25 mg/d) and high-dose (5 mg/d) ramipril was studied in 15 normotensive, non-diabetic patients with proteinuria (> 150 mg/d). The study was divided into four 12-week phases: placebo, high- or low-dose ramipril, switch to low- or high-dose ramipril, and placebo. At the end of each period, blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow rate, urinary protein excretion rate, and plasma angiotensin II levels were measured. Mean arterial pressure, urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio, and albumin excretion rate decreased significantly with low- and high-dose ramipril. The glomerular filtration rate and the renal plasma flow rate were not significantly changed. Angiotensin II plasma levels decreased with both low- and high-dose ramipril. No episodes of hypotension occurred during treatment with ramipril and only one subject developed a cough that did not require study drug discontinuation. In conclusion, administration of ramipril at both low and high doses lowered blood pressure and reduced proteinuria in this cohort of normotensive patients with a variety of proteinuric kidney diseases. The antiproteinuric effect of ramipril is probably mediated through a reduction in glomerular capillary pressure.",0,0

Therapeutic requirements to maintain tight blood pressure control.,,,"We report the efficacy of therapy over 5 years of follow-up in 758 non-insulin-dependent diabetics in a prospective, randomized, controlled study of the therapy of mild hypertension. Patients were recruited who had a systolic blood pressure over 150 mmHg or a diastolic over 85 mmHg under antihypertensive therapy or had a systolic blood pressure over 160 mmHg or a diastolic over 90 mmHg without therapy. Their mean blood pressure at entry into the study was 160/94 mmHg at a median age of 57 years. They were assigned to strict control (targeting systolic < 150/diastolic < 85 mmHg) or less stringent control (targeting systolic < 180/diastolic < 105 mmHg). The tight control group was assigned to receive either first-line therapy with a beta-blocker (atenolol) or an antitensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril), with the addition of other agents as needed. Over 5 years, mean blood pressure was significantly lower in the close control group (143/82 vs. 154/88 mmHg, p<0.001). No difference was found between those allocated atenolol or captopril. The proportion of patients requiring three or more antihypertensive regimens to maintain tight control increased from 16 and 15%, respectively, at 2 years to 25 and 26%, respectively, at 5 years, while it was in the less strict control group at 2 and 5 years, only 5% and 7% required three or more therapies. There was no difference in the incidence of side effects or hypoglycemic episodes between those given atenolol or captopril, but those given atenolol increased their body weight by an average of 2.3 kg compared to 0.5 kg in those given captopril was administered (p<0.01). . Allocation to atenolol was also associated with a modest increase in triglycerides and decreases in LDL and HDL cholesterol, of uncertain clinical relevance. The study will continue to determine whether the improved blood pressure control that has been achieved will be beneficial in maintaining patient health by reducing the occurrence of major clinical complications, mainly myocardial infarction and stroke, and microvascular complications, such as heart failure.

The secondary objective is to determine the equivalence of the effects of a calcium channel blocker (nisoldipine) and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) as first-line antihypertensive agents in the prevention and/or progression of these diabetic vascular complications. The study consists of two study populations aged 40-74 years, 470 hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure > or = 90.0 mmHg at time of randomization) and 480 normotensive patients (diastolic blood pressure of 80.0 mmHg at time of randomization) .

Patients will be randomized to receive either intensive antihypertensive drug therapy or moderate antihypertensive drug therapy. Patients will also be randomized to nisoldipine or enalapril, with open-label drugs added if further blood pressure control is needed. The primary endpoint is glomerular filtration rate, which is determined by 24-hour creatinine clearance. Secondary endpoints are urinary albumin excretion, left ventricular hypertrophy, retinopathy and neuropathy. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are also assessed.

2038,8961069,Circadian fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate in nonhypertensive congestive heart failure.,,"Giles, T D; Roffidal, L; Quiroz, A; Sander, G; Tresznewsky, O","This study aimed to determine whether decreases in circadian variability in arterial blood pressure and heart rate measured in outpatients correlate with neurohumoral indices of congestive heart failure severity that are not the result of systemic arterial hypertension and whether angiotensin-converting enzyme treatment (ACE) inhibitors would restore a more normal pattern. The study also examined the ability of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to detect pharmacodynamic patterns in patients with congestive heart failure, which is associated with reduced variability in circadian fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate in hospitalized patients. Elevated plasma norepinephrine, renin activity and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) have a positive correlation with worsening clinical condition. ACE inhibitors have been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure and neurohumoral measurements were recorded in 30 patients with congestive heart failure (Class II-IV, New York Heart Association) before treatment with lisinopril or captopril and repeated after 6 weeks of treatment. Fourier analysis was used as a curve-smoothing technique to compare the pharmacodynamics of the two ACE inhibitors. Absolute amplitude of systolic blood pressure was inversely correlated with plasma norepinephrine and ANP (p=0.004) but not with renin activity. Mean 24-hour systemic arterial blood pressure did not decrease significantly after treatment with ACE inhibitors. An increase in absolute amplitude of systolic blood pressure was inversely correlated with baseline amplitude (p<0.00001). Examination of the Fourier smoothed curves revealed differences in the circadian effects of lisinopril and captopril on systolic blood pressure and the frequency-pressure product. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can be useful in assessing the severity and management of congestive heart failure.",0,0

Unlike captopril, it is a prodrug of the pharmacologically active moexiprilat and is administered once daily. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of moexipril versus captopril during 12 weeks of treatment in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Patients with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of 95-114 mmHg inclusive were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive moexipril 7.5 mg once daily or captopril 25 mg twice daily. After 6 weeks of treatment, if the patient's SDBP remained > or = 90 mmHg, the dose of moexipril and captopril was increased to 15 mg once daily and 50 mg twice daily, respectively. Blood pressure was measured at biweekly visits. At the end of the study, the adjusted mean SDBP reductions were comparable between the moexipril and captopril groups (-9.8 vs. -8.7 mm Hg), and moexipril was more effective than captopril at reducing sitting systolic blood pressure. Side effects (headache, dizziness and upper respiratory tract infection) occurred with similar frequency in the moexipril and captopril groups.

After a four-week placebo run-in period, patients received either ramipril 2.5 mg or enalapril 10 mg once daily for four weeks. Doses were increased to 5 mg ramipril and 20 mg enalapril for a further four weeks. After a four-week placebo washout period, patients were switched to the alternative treatment. The decrease in mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure from week 0 to week 8 was greater by 1.6 mmHg with ramipril than with enalapril (90% confidence interval 0.6-2.7 mmHg). The corresponding reduction in systolic blood pressure was also greater with ramipril than with enalapril by 2.4 mmHg (90% confidence interval: 0.5-4.2 mmHg). For the difference in the fall in 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure between ramipril and enalapril, the lower value of the 90% confidence interval (CI) is above the clinically relevant difference of -3 mmHg. This indicates that ramipril (2.5 and 5 mg doses) is at least as effective as enalapril (10 and 20 mg doses) in lowering blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The duration of an adequate antihypertensive effect was relatively long for both ramipril and enalapril; However, ramipril tended to have a longer antihypertensive effect.

Two study phases, each lasting 172 hours, were separated by a 2-week placebo phase. Repeated measurements of the following parameters were performed: brachial artery systolic blood pressure (SBP); diastolic blood pressure and mean blood pressure (using a mercury sphygmomanometer); carotid artery SBP and pulse pressure (by applanation tonometry); aortic stiffness (due to pulse wave velocity); and the effect of arterial wave reflections in the common carotid artery (the augmentation index by applanation tonometry). A radioimmunoassay was used to determine plasma angiotensin II levels. The pharmacokinetics of quinaprilat were studied using a specific assay. Two-way (time treatment) analysis of variance for repeated measures, analysis of covariance for two inner factors and a covariate changing with factor time magnitude (pressure measured at each time point) and baseline values of the parameter under study as a second covariate were used for the statistical Analysis used.; Quinapril treatment induced a long-lasting decrease in arterial wave reflections that was observable 172 h after quinapril administration and persisted after the blood pressure lowering effect had been reversed. The effect on wave reflections was associated with a more pronounced and sustained decrease in carotid artery SBP and pulse pressure than that of brachial SBP and pulse pressure. Administration of quinapril also induced a long-lasting decrease in aortic pulse wave velocity, but this effect was entirely dependent on parallel changes in blood pressure. Changes in arterial hemodynamics were unrelated to angiotensin II or quinaprilat plasma levels. The results of this controlled study indicate that ACE inhibition results in a long-lasting, blood pressure-independent decrease in arterial wave reflections in ESRD patients. The consequence of this was a decrease in the pulsatile pressure load in the central arteries with increased distensibility of the aorta. The increased distensibility of the aorta resulted from the decrease in blood pressure.

Patients were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive valsartan 80 mg once daily, enalapril 20 mg once daily, or placebo in the general practice for 8 weeks. Patients were examined after 4 and 8 weeks of therapy.; The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) after 8 weeks of therapy. Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP) and response rates at 8 weeks.; Valsartan and enalapril resulted in statistically significant reductions in diastolic and systolic blood pressure compared to placebo. Similar falls were noted in both active treatment groups, with mean SDBP changes of -9.5 mmHg for valsartan and -9.4 mmHg for enalapril (-4.5 mmHg for placebo) at 8 weeks. No significant differences were found between valsartan and enalapril in terms of SDBP or SSBP reduction. Response rates at 8 weeks were significantly greater for valsartan (54%) and enalapril (58%) than for placebo (20%), with no significant difference between the two active treatments. Both valsartan and enalapril demonstrated consistent antihypertensive effects over time, with 90% of patients responding at 4 weeks with a response at 8 weeks. Both treatments were well tolerated. Although the incidence of cough in the study was generally low, more cases were reported with enalapril (three) than with valsartan (one) or placebo (none). The data show that valsartan 80 mg once daily is as effective as enalapril 20 mg once daily in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. Valsartan is well tolerated and does not appear to be associated with an increase in cough frequency.",0,0

NSVT is associated with increased mortality in CHF. However, the predictive value of NSVT as a marker of sudden death or death from progressive heart failure has not been determined.; Five hundred and sixteen patients from the GESICA study (33.4% with NSVT) were initially evaluated with the results of a 24-hour holter and a two-year follow-up. Within 2 years, 87 of 173 patients (50.3%) with NSVT and 106 of 343 patients (30.9%) without NSVT died. The relative risk (RR) was 1.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27 to 2.24; P<0.0002) and the Cox proportional hazards analysis was 1.62 (95% CI, 1.22 to 2.16, P<0.001). Sudden death increased from 8.7% (30 of 343) to 23.7% (41 of 173) in patients with NSVT (RR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.78 to 4.44; p<0.001 ). Deaths from progressive heart failure also increased from 17.5% (60 out of 343) to 20.8% (36 out of 173) (p=0.22). Quantitative analysis of the 24-hour Holter (first 295 patients) showed that couplets accounted for both all-cause mortality (RR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.66; p<0.002) and sudden death (RR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.57 to 7.25; P<0.0005). Couplets and/or ventricular repetitive beats (NSVT) were even more predictive of sudden death (RR, 10.1; 95% CI, 1.91 to 52.7; p<0.01); In patients with CHF, NSVT is an independent marker of increased all-cause mortality and sudden death. The absence of NSVT and ventricular repetitive beats in a 24-hour holter indicates a low probability of sudden death.",0,0

2054,9000551,Kidney failure associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Textor, S C","The introduction of agents that block the renin-angiotensin system has brought great benefits to patients with hypertension, kidney disease, and congestive heart failure. Some of the therapeutic benefits associated with the kidney derive from the removal of angiotensin II at the efferent arteriole. In certain circumstances when the afferent blood supply is compromised, particularly beyond renal artery stenosis, use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may result in a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and impaired potassium excretion, for which physicians should be prepared should and manage. How often this occurs and when such a decrease threatens the viability of the renal parenchyma depends on the initial conditions of the renal vessels and sodium balance. Although these observations have been made primarily with ACE inhibitors, the basic principles apply to other agents that interact with components of the renin-angiotensin system, including angiotensin II antagonists and renin inhibitors. If recognized and treated promptly, changes in renal function in these conditions represent a modest and acceptable risk worth accepting in exchange for great therapeutic benefit.",0,0

After a placebo run-in period, 308 patients (all white) were randomized to treatment groups and took medication once daily for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was measured between 23 and 26 hours after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Patients wore a noninvasive blood pressure monitor for 24 hours prior to randomization and prior to the last visit. Investigators recorded adverse experiences at randomization and study weeks 4 and 8, and received samples for laboratory testing at randomization and study week 8. 307 patients were evaluated for efficacy and 308 for tolerability and safety. At endpoint (the last measurement after randomization for each patient), the reduction in mean seated diastolic blood pressure was statistically significantly greater for treatment with amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg than for either comparator therapy. The results of 24-hour monitoring showed that amlodipine/benazepril treatment maintained hourly mean diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mmHg in contrast to monotherapy.

2060,9007680,The practical assessment of compliance with an ACE inhibitor therapy - a novel approach.,,"MacFadyen, R J; Struthers, A D","Poor compliance may be responsible for symptomatic decompensation or neurohormonal ""flight"" in heart failure patients treated long-term with angiotensin converting enzyme-1 (ACEI) drugs. Serum ACE activity is a poor predictor of neurohormonal suppression or hemodynamic effect after ACE inhibitor treatment. However, serum ACE activity can be a useful index of therapy compliance since serum ACE is sensitive to the presence of an ACE inhibitor in the blood. Sixteen male subjects with normal blood pressure and known ACE genotype received randomized, double-blind therapy on four occasions 2 weeks apart with lisinopril 20 mg (L) or matched placebo (P) for 7 days to reduce (A) noncompliance (all P ), (B) complete compliance (all L), (C) partial compliance (L days 1, 3, 6; P days 2, 4, 5, 7), or (D) single dose (L day 7; P, 1- 6). In the supine position (30 min), blood pressure (BP)/heart rate (HR), ACE, and angiotensins were measured on day 7 pre-dose and 4-6 h post-dose. Results are means +/- 1 standard deviation. Blood pressure showed the expected small decrease with active treatment on d7 (B or D), but not with placebo (A) or partial compliance (C). Serum ACE from the preliminary study was reproducible within subjects [coefficient of variation (CV), 1.7%] despite a large range (16-124 U/L). Serum ACE activity before (41.9 +/- 30) and after (41 +/- 30) angiotensin (A) I or II was unaffected by treatment (placebo A). Active treatment (B) resulted in very low serum ACE activity and d7 and a little further post-dosing suppression (before 3.9 +/- 4; after 1.8 +/- 4). AI was increased in this group, with further increase after dosing (before 234 +/- 116; after 551 +/- 250). AII was only slightly reduced from baseline and showed little further suppression after dosing (7.8 +/- 4 before; 6.3 +/- 5 after). Partial compliance (C) showed low ACE but no reduction after treatment (before 7 +/- 3; after 7 +/- 4), increased AI but no dose effect (before 187 +/- 198; after 200+ /- 151) and reduced AII but without further dose suppression (before 6.4 +/- 3.4; after 7 +/- 4) induced increase in peptide (compared to B). The single dose treatment (D) showed ACE inhibition as expected (before 47 +/- 30; after 2.2 +/- 3). There was a dose-related increase in AI, but to a lesser extent than with chronic active dosing (B) (before 39 +/- 10; after 240 +/- 200). In contrast to long-term dosing, there was a clear ANG II suppression (before 8.8 +/- 4; afterwards 2.9 +/- 3). With this long-acting ACE inhibitor at a dose relevant to the management of congestive heart failure, we propose that 4-6 hours post-dose serum ACE (< 5 EU/L) and elevated ANG I (> 300 pg /ml) Confirm treatment compliance. These absolute values may be altered in patients concomitantly treated with loop diuretics. In principle, however, this may be a useful tool in clinical trials or in clinical practice after further work has been done to assess limitations in patients across dosages and across the range of available drugs used.",0,0

Previous study designs were often insufficient to show the details of the interactions between these antihypertensive drugs. This study used a modified 4 x 4 factorial, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design to investigate the efficacy of 17 different doses of fosinopril (Fos), a phosphinic acid-derived ACE inhibitor, and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in 550 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Data from these variables were fitted to Quadratic Response Surface Models (QRSM) using polynomial functions in the doses of the two components. Using QRSM, seated systolic (SeSBP) and diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) responses at 8 weeks were predicted for actual doses and interpolated for unstudied intermediate doses. Fos and HCTZ alone and in combination produced a dose-dependent reduction in SeSBP and SeDBP. The use of 10 mg Fos + 12.5 mg HCTZ reduced the adjusted mean SeDBP by 6.3 mm Hg and 20 mg Fos + 12.5 mg HCTZ reduced the same measure by 9.1 mm Hg. Co-administration of Fos and HCTZ produced an additive antihypertensive effect. This combination drug antihypertensive study using a factorial design with QRSM accurately predicts dose responses and is a valuable methodology for clinical trials.",0,0

2063,9010643,risk-benefit assessment of losartan potassium in the treatment of hypertension.,,"Burrell, L M","Losartan potassium is the first in a new class of orally active antihypertensives that antagonize the action of angiotensin (AT) II at the AT1 receptor subtype. Losartan potassium is converted by the liver to the active metabolite E-3174, which is a more potent antagonist at the AT1 receptor. E-3174 is responsible for most of the pharmacological effects of losartan potassium, and its long half-life contributes to the drug's prolonged duration of action. Losartan potassium is effective as a once-daily antihypertensive drug. For mild to moderate hypertension, losartan potassium has similar efficacy to sustained-release enalapril, atenolol, and felodipine. When losartan potassium is combined with hydrochlorothiazide, blood pressure is further reduced. Losartan potassium is well tolerated in mild, moderate, and severe essential hypertension, with dizziness being the only reported drug-related adverse reaction. The overall rate of patient discontinuations due to adverse experiences with losartan potassium is lower (2.3%) compared to placebo (3.7%). Hypotension on the first dose is uncommon, possibly due to the drug's slower onset of action, and coughing does not appear to be a significant problem. A number of areas regarding the safety and efficacy of losartan potassium remain to be elucidated. In particular, long-term tolerance studies are required; Cough only appeared as a side effect of ACE inhibitors after 3 to 4 years of use. Post-marketing surveillance has shown that angioedema, a rare but life-threatening side effect of ACE inhibitors, also occurs with losartan potassium. More data on the use of losartan potassium in patients with renal impairment are needed before accepting the recommendation that no dose adjustment is necessary. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of losartan potassium in patients with liver disease also require further investigation. Losartan potassium increases uric acid secretion and decreases plasma uric acid levels, which may be beneficial when losartan potassium is combined with a thiazide diuretic, but may otherwise result in uric acid stone formation and possible nephropathy. Simply controlling blood pressure is no longer an adequate goal in the management of hypertension. Any new antihypertensive agent should also reduce cardiovascular events, prevent or reverse end-organ damage such as left ventricular hypertrophy, atherosclerosis and renal failure, and not impair quality of life. Such data on losartan potassium are currently not available. Losartan potassium is likely to be used in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors, but its future in treating high blood pressure will depend on long-term safety studies and data on its effects beyond simple blood pressure control.",0,0

2069,9032106,Differences between nisoldipine and lisinopril on glomerular filtration rates and albuminuria in hypertensive IDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy during the first year of treatment.,,"Rossing, P; Tarnow, L; Boelskifte, S; Jensen, B R; Nielsen, F S; Parving, H H","Our aim was to compare the effects of a long-acting calcium channel blocker (nisoldipine) and an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) on albuminuria, arterial blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in hypertensive IDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy. We conducted a 1-year, double-blind, randomized, double-dummy controlled study comparing nisoldipine (20-40 mg once daily) with lisinopril (10-20 mg once daily) in 52 IDDM hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy. Three patients dropped out and the results for the remaining 49 (25 nisoldipine, 24 lisinopril) are presented. Diuretics were required in 10 patients treated with nisoldipine and 8 with lisinopril. Ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure (TM2420, A&D, Tokyo, Japan) and albuminuria in three 24-hour samples (enzyme immunoassay) were measured every 3 months; GFR (51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance) was recorded every 6 months. Mean arterial blood pressure (24 h) increased from (mean +/- SE) 108 +/- 3 mmHg at baseline to a mean of 101 +/- 2 mmHg during treatment in the lisinopril group and from 105 +/- 2 to 103 + decreased /- 2 in the nisoldipine group (P=0.06 comparing changes in the two groups). Albuminuria was reduced by 47% (95% CI 21-65) in the lisinopril group versus an 11% increase (-3 to 27) in the nisoldipine group (p=0.001). Fractional albumin clearance was reduced by 37% (95% CI 4-59%) in the lisinopril group versus an increase of 35% (8-69%) in the nisoldipine group (p<0.01) . GFR decreased from 85 +/- 5 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2) to 73 +/- 5 in the lisinopril group and from 84 +/- 6 to 80 +/- 7 in the nisoldipine group (P<0.05). The effect of study medication on albuminuria and GFR was independent of changes in systemic blood pressure and baseline variables in multiple regression analyses. In conclusion, lisinopril reduced albuminuria, but also GFR, to a greater extent than nisoldipine in hypertensive IDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy during the first year of treatment. Longer follow-up is needed to clarify whether these drugs have differential renoprotective effects.",0,0
2070,9036753,Enalapril reduces QTc dispersion in mild congestive heart failure secondary to coronary artery disease.,,"Barr, C S; Naas, A A; Fenwick, M; Struthers, A D","This study was designed to investigate the possible mechanisms by which enalapril improves cardiac function and mortality in chronic heart failure. We investigated possible mechanisms by following 41 patients with early heart failure over a one-year period. These patients were prospectively randomized in a triple-blind manner to receive either enalapril or placebo. Repeated measurements of echocardiographic parameters, glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, hematocrit, plasma neurohormones and QTc dispersion were performed throughout the year. Echocardiographic parameters improved with enalapril but deteriorated with placebo (cardiac output 4.6 +/- 1.6 to 3.7 +/- 1.5 L/min with placebo and 4.5 +/- 1.3 to 5.8 +/- 2.0 L/min with enalapril; p<0.01). ). In contrast, there were no significant changes in renal blood flow (518 +/- 185 to 509 +/- 180 mL/min/1.73 m2 with placebo and 541 +/- 142 to 504 +/- 162 mL/min/1 .73 m2). m2 with enalapril). The glomerular filtration rate changed from 79 +/- 20 to 78 +/- 19 mL/min/1.73 m2 with placebo and from 85 +/- 21 to 73 +/- 27 mL/min/1.73 m2 with enalapril (p=0.051). Enalapril reduced hematocrit (0.414 +/- 0.041 to 0.377 +/- 0.040%) significantly more than placebo (0.420 +/- 0.029 to 0.411 +/- 0.023 L/L; p<0.01). In addition, enalapril resulted in a significant reduction in QTc dispersion (93 +/- 36 to 88 +/- 28 ms with placebo and 93 +/- 35 to 60 +/- 22 ms with enalapril; p<0.05). Thus, enalapril significantly reduced hematocrit and reduced QTc dispersion in early heart failure. Both of these effects, particularly the latter, may be an important mechanism for the reduced mortality seen with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure. In contrast, renal hemodynamics did not progress with either the placebo-induced deterioration in cardiac function or the enalapril-induced improvements in cardiac function.",0,0
2071,9037321,The changes in insulin sensitivity during treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with changes in calcium/magnesium balance.,,"Haenni, A; Berglund, L; Reneland, R; Anderssson, P E; Lind, L; Lithell, H","The present analysis was performed to examine the relationships between changes in mineral factors, specifically the balance between serum calcium and magnesium concentrations (S-Ca and S-Mg, respectively), and variables affecting glucose and lipid metabolism during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) reflect. inhibitor treatment. A total of 96 patients with essential hypertension participating in four double-blind studies using four different ACE inhibitors and similar protocols were included. At the end of the initial placebo period and at the end of the active drug treatment period, a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp test was performed, lipoprotein status was determined, and concentrations of serum electrolytes were measured. Serum ACE activity was determined in the fosinopril treated group. Changes in insulin sensitivity index (M/I) correlated directly with changes in S-Mg (r = 0.24, P < 0.02) and inversely with changes in S-Ca (r = -0.19, P = 0.07 ) and the ratio between serum calcium and magnesium concentrations (Ca/Mg) (r = -0.27, P < 0.008). The change in total serum triglycerides (S-Tg) was inversely correlated with the change in S-Mg (r = -0.35, P < 0.0005) and directly correlated with the change in Ca/Mg ratio (r = 0, 36, P<0.0004). The reduction in serum ACE activity correlated with a more pronounced increase in S-Mg (r = -0.62, P < 0.002) and a decrease in Ca/Mg ratio (r = 0.73, P = 0.0002 ). We conclude that changes in the studied metabolic variables and in serum ACE activity during ACE inhibitor treatment are related to changes in mineral status and the balance between serum calcium and magnesium concentrations.",0,0

An incremental dose-response effect was observed for both clinical and ambulatory blood pressure parameters during treatment with mibefradil and nifedipine GITS alone and in combination with lisinopril. At maximum dosing, mibefradil-treated patients experienced greater (P<0.05) reductions in clinical and ambulatory diastolic blood pressure and a greater response rate (86% vs. 69%). The trough-to-peak ratios for systolic and diastolic blood pressure were >90% at each dose level. A significant decrease in baseline heart rate was observed with mibefradil 150 mg alone or in combination with lisinopril, but no patient experienced clinically significant atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. Adverse events related to vasodilation were more common in the nifedipine-GITS group. Consequently, the results of the present study demonstrate that the novel calcium channel blocker mibefradil, either alone or in combination with lisinopril, is effective in lowering clinical and 24-hour blood pressure while reducing heart rate and is well tolerated in patients with moderate to severe disease Hypertension.",0,0

Indicators and thresholds were developed and approved by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The medical records of 227 patients prescribed lisinopril from June 1991 to June 1992 were reviewed for adequacy of prescription, adequacy of monitoring, occurrence of adverse drug reactions, and detection of drug interactions. Prescribing was appropriate in 97% and supervision was appropriate in all cases reviewed. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were cough (7%), hypotension (3%) and rash (2%). Patients have also been prescribed several medications that may interact with lisinopril. Lisinopril appeared to be well tolerated and effective. Adverse drug reactions associated with lisinopril occurred in 40 patients (18%). There appeared to be no major deficiencies in the prescription of lisinopril and no corrective action needed to be taken other than education on the appropriate use of lisinopril. Information from this assessment of drug use is helpful in formal decision-making.",0,0

Study on Treatment of Mild Hypertension (TOMHS),,"Grimm, R H; Grandits, G A; Prineas, R J; McDonald, R H; Lewis, C E; Flack, J M; Yunis, C; Svendsen, K; Liebson, P R; Elmer, P J","Problems with sexual function have long been a problem in the management of hypertension and can influence the choice of treatment regimen and the decision to stop medication. The Treatment of Mild Hypertension (TOMHS) study provides an excellent opportunity to study sexual function and the effects of treatment on sexual function in men and women with stage I diastolic hypertension and long-term follow-up. TOMHS was a double-blind, randomized, controlled study of 902 hypertensive subjects (557 males, 345 females) aged 45 to 69 years treated with placebo or one of five active ingredients (acebutolol, amlodipine maleate, chlorthalidone, doxazosin maleate, or enalapril maleate). ). All participants received intensive lifestyle counseling regarding weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, alcohol reduction (for current drinkers), and increased physical activity. Sexual function was assessed through physician interviews at baseline and annually during follow-up. At baseline, 14.4% of men and 4.9% of women reported problems with sexual function. For men, 12.2% had trouble getting and/or keeping an erection; 2.0% of women said they had trouble having an orgasm. Erectile problems in men at baseline were positively associated with age, systolic pressure, and previous antihypertensive drug use. The incidence of erectile dysfunction during follow-up in men was 9.5% and 14.7% at 24 and 48 months, respectively, and was related to the type of antihypertensive therapy. Participants randomized to chlorthalidone reported a significantly higher incidence of erectile problems over 24 months than participants randomized to placebo (17.1% vs. 8.1%, P=0.025). Incidence rates were more similar between the treatment groups at 48 months than at 24 months, with non-significant differences between the chlorthalidone and placebo groups. The incidence was lowest in the doxazosin group but was not significantly different from the placebo group. The incidence in the acebutolol, amlodipine and enalapril groups was similar to that in the placebo group. In many cases, erectile dysfunction did not require stopping medication. The disappearance of erection problems in men with problems at baseline was common in all groups, but was greatest in the doxazosin group. The incidence of reported sexual problems in women was low in all treatment groups. In summary, the long-term incidence of erectile dysfunction in treated hypertensive men is relatively low, but is higher with chlorthalidone treatment. Effects of erectile dysfunction with chlorthalidone appear relatively early and are often tolerable, and are unlikely to recur after 2 years. The rate of reported sexual problems in women with high blood pressure is low and does not appear to differ by type of drug. Similar incidence rates of erectile dysfunction for placebo and most drug groups caution against routinely attributing erectile problems to antihypertensive drugs.",0,0
2075,9039154,Combined sympathetic suppression and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in congestive heart failure.,,"Manolis, A J; Olympios, C; Sifaki, M; Handanis, S; Cokkinos, D; Bresnahan, M; Gavras, I; Gavras, H","Neurohormonal activation is a pathogenic contributor and prognostic marker in congestive heart failure (CHF). While angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is now the first-line therapy, sympathetic inhibition has only recently been proposed for this purpose. Recently we reported an improvement in preload parameters by sympathetic suppression with clonidine. In the present work, we evaluated the effects of a single oral dose of a combination of clonidine 0.15 mg + captopril 6.25 mg compared to captopril 6.15 + placebo in a single-blind parallel study in 16 patients with CHF class III or IV ( 13 males, 3 females aged 62 +/- 8 years with an ejection fraction of 33 +/- 8%). Hemodynamic and hormonal measurements were performed at baseline after diagnostic cardiac catheterization and again 2 hours after treatment. The results show that preload parameters such as RAP, PCWP and MPAP decreased significantly with the combination therapy but not with captopril alone. On the contrary, SVR decreased significantly with both treatments and SVI increased significantly with both - but the latter change was significantly greater for the captopril/clonidine combination than for captopril alone. Suppression of plasma norepinephrine occurred only with the combination (apparently attributable to clonidine), while plasma renin activity increased with both regimens, apparently due to captopril. Our results show that the combination of clonidine with captopril induces significant improvements in both preload and afterload parameters of CHF and activated neurohormone correction, suggesting additive hemodynamic and hormonal benefits of the two treatment modalities.",0,0
2076,9040453,Determination of the trough-to-peak ratio in parallel group experiments. Systolic Hypertension in Europe (SYST-EUR) Investigators.,,"Staessen, J A; Thijs, L; Bijttebier, G; Clement, D; O'Brien, E T; Palatini, P; Rodicio, J L; Rosenfeld, J; Fagard, R","We evaluated in parallel-group studies how to manage inter-individual variability, correction for placebo effects, and smoothing of blood pressure profiles when measuring trough-to-peak ratio in 244 individuals with isolated systolic hypertension (> or = 60 years), who were enrolled in the placebo-controlled study of systolic hypertension in Europe. Net treatment effects were calculated by subtracting mean changes from baseline on placebo (n=133) from those during active treatment (n=111). On admission, in-hospital systolic/diastolic pressures averaged 176/86 mm Hg and 149/80 mm Hg with 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. With corrections for baseline and placebo, nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg/d), with the possible addition of enalapril (5 to 20 mg/d) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg/d), reduced (P< 001) these blood pressure readings by 16.6/7.3 and 9.8/4.7 mmHg, respectively. The net trough-to-peak ratios were first determined from blood pressure profiles (12 hours) with 1 hour precision synchronized by the morning and evening doses of the double-blind medication. Using the usual approach, without accounting for inter-subject variability, the net trough-to-peak systolic/diastolic ratios were 0.46/0.40 in the morning and 0.77/0.99 in the evening. In individual subjects, the baseline-corrected trough-to-peak ratios were not normally distributed. We therefore used a nonparametric technique to calculate the net trough-to-peak ratios from the results in individual subjects. In the morning these ratios averaged 0.25 systolic (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.41) and 0.15 diastolic (95% confidence interval 0.00 to 0.31) and in the evening 0.19 and 0.36 (95 % confidence interval 0.00 to 0.38). 0.14 to 0.56). When blood pressure profiles were smoothed by replacing 1-hour averages with 2-hour moving or fixed averages, or by Fourier modeling, trough-to-peak ratios remained unchanged after the morning dose (0.20/0 .13, 0.20/0.14 and 0.16/0.21) but tended to increase in the evening (0.32/0.38, 0.28/0.40 and 0.48/0.49 ). In conclusion, the proposed parallel group analysis allows for the trough-to-peak ratio to be corrected for both baseline and placebo, accounts for inter-subject variability, and assigns a confidence interval for the net trough-to-peak calculate ratio. Accounting for inter-individual variability reduces the trough-to-peak ratio. Smoothing affects the individualized net trough-to-peak ratios in an unpredictable way and should therefore be avoided.",0,0

2078,9048272,Perindopril/hydrochlorothiazide dose combinations for the treatment of hypertension: a multicenter study.,,"Chrysant, S G","The primary goal of combination therapy is to improve efficacy without compromising safety. In this multi-centre study, the efficacy and tolerability of adding perindopril to continued hydrochlorothiazide therapy in patients with mild to moderate (Stage I and II) essential hypertension was evaluated. 252 patients with supine diastolic blood pressures of 95 mmHg to 114 mmHg were treated with open-label hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day for 4 weeks. The 208 patients whose supine diastolic blood pressure was > or = 90 mmHg at the end of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy entered into 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with placebo or perindopril added to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day therapy as follows : placebo (n=50) and perindopril doses of 2 mg/day (n=52), 4 mg/day (n=53), and 8 mg/day (n=53). The perindopril-hydrochlorothiazide combinations reduced both supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 10.3/6.7, 9.6/8.0, and 9.3/6.3 mmHg, respectively, at perindopril doses of 2, 4 or 8 mg/day; There was no difference between the three drug groups. Placebo reduced blood pressure by 1.6/2.0 mmHg, an effect that was significantly less than that of perindopril-hydrochlorothiazide combinations.

A report from the investigators of the AIRE study.,,"Cleland, J G; Erhardt, L; Murray, G; Hall, A S; Ball, S G","The importance of the effects of ACE inhibitors in sudden cardiac death, progressive heart failure and recurrent myocardial infarction for the reduction of all-cause mortality in heart failure and after myocardial infarction is controversial.; The AIRE study randomized 2006 patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of heart failure within 2-9 days of myocardial infarction to receive ramipiril 5 mg twice daily or matched placebo. Outcomes were assessed independently by members of an endpoints committee who were blinded to treatment assignment.; Fewer patients developed severe resistant heart failure as their first validated endpoint with Rampril, despite the greater number of at-risk survivors compared to placebo (n=143 vs. 178; risk reduction 23%; CI 5 to 39%; P=0.017). Ramipril did not change the rate of reinfarction or stroke. Regardless of treatment allocation, 182 (46%) patients developed resistant heart failure before death. Validated acute or distant myocardial reinfarction occurred in 76 (19%) patients prior to death and 90 (23%) patients experienced chest pain around the time of death, suggesting an ischemic element to these deaths during readmission and 145 outside the hospital. Sudden death accounted for 54% of all deaths and 93% of out-of-hospital deaths. Ramipril reduced the risk of sudden death by 30% (95% CI: 8-47%; p=0.011). Overall, however, 45% of patients who died suddenly had severe or worsening heart failure before they died. Only 39% of sudden deaths were attributed to arrhythmias. Ramipril reduced the risk of death from cardiovascular failure by 18% but did not reach statistical significance (95% CI; 41 to -14%; p=0.237). The magnitude of the effects on sudden death and death from circulatory failure were not significantly different. However, 38% of the reduction in all-cause mortality came from the sudden cardiac death subgroup who had previously developed severe resistant heart failure (placebo n=35, ramipril n=15), again underscoring the clear benefit in heart failure prevention. Ramipril did not selectively alter the ratio of in-hospital and out-of-hospital deaths; Ramipril reduces mortality and progression to resistant heart failure in patients with evidence of heart failure early after myocardial infarction. Delaying the progression of heart failure appears to be a major factor contributing to the reduction in mortality, both by reducing circulatory failure and reducing sudden death.",1,1

Patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) have an increased cardiovascular mortality rate compared to diabetic patients without DAN.; The present double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled study analyzed the effect of quinapril, an ACE inhibitor, on time- and frequency-domain HRV variables in patients with DAN. Forty patients (17 males and 23 females) with a mean age of 51 (range 19-68) years, free from coronary artery disease and arterial hypertension, were randomized to receive quinapril or placebo. HRV was recorded at months 0, 3 and 6. The parameters measured were 1) time-domain indices: SD of all 24-h RR intervals (intervals between consecutive electrocardiogram R-waves) or SDNN/24-h; Mean of the SD of the RR intervals of all 5-minute segments (SDNN/5-minutes); root mean square of the differences of consecutive RR intervals (RMSSD); and percentage of RR intervals differing by more than 50 ms (pNN50); and 2) frequency domain indices: total power (TP), high frequency power (HFP), low frequency power (LFP), and very low frequency power (VLFP). The HRV values of the 40 patients were compared to one of 20 matched diabetics with analogous glycemic control without DAN and 20 healthy controls.; Compared to placebo, quinapril increased total HRV: SDNN/24-h (P<0.05), TP (P<0.05), and HRV parameters related to parasympathetic activity: pNN50 (P<0.01 ). RMSSD (P<0.05) and HFP in absolute and normalized units (P<0.01). The LFP/HFP ratio was reduced (p<0.01). Despite the beneficial effect of quinapril on HRV parasympathetic variables, these remained lower than those of diabetics without DAN and healthy controls.; Our results suggest that quinapril significantly increases parasympathetic activity in patients with DAN 3 months after the start of treatment and maintains this effect up to month 6.

Trough-to-peak ratios for the combinations ranged from 0.63 (enalapril 5 mg - felodipine ER 2.5 mg) to 0.79 (enalapril 20 mg - felodipine ER 10 mg), consistent with effective blood pressure control 1 dose/day. Patients aged > or = 65 years showed greater reductions in diastolic blood pressure. Combinations of enalapril and felodipine ER were associated with less drug-induced peripheral edema (4.1%) compared to felodipine ER monotherapy (10.8%). No serious drug-related side effects were observed during the study. In this study, the combination of enalapril and felodipine ER was effective in lowering blood pressure and was generally well tolerated with an excellent safety profile in the treatment of hypertension.",0,0
2085,9053816,Quinapril versus lisinopril in the treatment of essential hypertension in elderly patients with low blood renin levels.,,"Rengo, F; Canonico, V","The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of quinapril 20 mg once daily compared to lisinopril 20 mg once daily in the treatment of elderly patients with essential mild or moderate hypertension and low plasma renin levels. This was a crossover study with randomly assigned open-label treatments. Ten patients were treated, 6 women and 4 men, with a mean age of 67.1 years +/- 7.1. Two placebo wash-out periods were planned, each lasting one week prior to the start of active therapy; each treatment period lasted 21 days. Blood pressure controls (including 24-hour monitoring) were performed at basal time, after seven days, and at the end of each treatment. The results demonstrate the efficacy and safety of both drugs, and confirmed more effective and consistent hypertension control by quinapril.",0,0

This was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study in 129 adult outpatients with essential hypertension. After confirmation of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough during a 2- to 4-week challenge with lisinopril (followed by a 2-week washout period), patients were randomized to receive double-blind treatment at 80 mg once daily for 6 weeks valsartan, 10 mg lisinopril or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide. Assessments were made at baseline and after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. Comparability of treatment response was assessed using mean seated diastolic and systolic blood pressure at the end of treatment. The incidence of dry, persistent cough was significantly less (P<0.001) than lisinopril (68.9%) with valsartan (19.5%) than with lisinopril (68.9%) at 3 and 6 weeks, with no significant difference between valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (19.0 %) occurred. There were no statistically significant differences in blood pressure reduction between the three treatment groups. The overall incidence of adverse reactions, whether treatment-related or not, was highest for lisinopril (86.7%) compared to valsartan (57.1%) and hydrochlorothiazide (61.9%). A dry cough in the lisinopril group accounted for this difference. There were no clinically significant changes in physical symptoms or clinical laboratory test results during double-blind treatment, with the exception of metabolic changes in 3 patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide. In hypertensive patients with a history of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough, a single daily dose of 80 mg of valsartan resulted in therapeutic efficacy comparable to lisinopril, but with significantly less cough.",0,0
2087,9056614,Perindopril reduces blood pressure but not cerebral blood flow in patients with recent cerebral ischemic stroke.,,"Dyker, A G; Grosset, D G; Lees, K","The relationship between high blood pressure and the incidence of stroke is well documented. At this time, the impact of lowering blood pressure in patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease remains unclear, and concerns remain about the management of patients shortly after a stroke event. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors maintain cerebral blood flow, although they lower blood pressure in patients with heart failure and otherwise uncomplicated hypertension. We tested the hypothesis that perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with a gradual onset of action and minimal antihypertensive effect at the first dose, lowers blood pressure without impairing cerebral blood flow in patients 2 to 7 days after the symptoms of a cerebral infarction. ; Patients were randomized in a double-blind study to receive oral perindopril (4 mg) or placebo for 15 days. Blood pressure was monitored semi-automatically. Cerebral blood flow was calculated from internal carotid artery and vertebral Doppler ultrasound supplemented with middle cerebral artery blood velocities.; Twenty-four patients completed the protocol; Four other patients were withdrawn for reasons unrelated to treatment. Patients on perindopril had a placebo-corrected blood pressure reduction of 19/11 mmHg. Blood pressure remained reduced after 2 weeks of treatment. In contrast, total cerebral blood flow was not affected by perindopril. Neurological symptoms improved similarly in both groups.; Perindopril was well tolerated and effective in lowering blood pressure without impairing carotid blood flow in patients with symptoms of recent cerebral ischemia.",0,0
2088,9056686,Effects of erythropoietin on endothelin-1 synthesis and the cellular calcium messenger system in vascular endothelial cells.,,"Vogel, V; Kramer, H J; BÃ¤cker, A; Meyer-Lehnert, H; Jelkmann, W; Fandrey, J","An increase in blood pressure is the main side effect of erythropoietin (EPO) treatment in patients with renal anemia. However, the mechanisms by which EPO can cause hypertension are still unclear. We therefore examined the effects of EPO on endothelin (ET) synthesis and cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) concentration in vascular endothelial cells. Porcine endothelial cells were isolated from thoracic aorta, pulmonary artery and vena cava. Studies were performed with cells from the first subculture. ET concentrations were measured radioimmunologically. Changes in [Ca2+]i were determined with the fluorescence probe Fura-2. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by the sodium 3'-[1-(phenyl-amino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzenesulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) assay. ET synthesis was similar and time-dependent in cells of different vascular origins, reaching approximately 2 pmol ET/mg protein within 12 h of incubation. EPO (12 to 200 U/mL) stimulated ET release in a time- and dose-dependent manner by up to 83.2% (P<0.01) within 12 h in the absence of fetal calf serum and heparin. EPO induced an immediate significant increase in [Ca2+]i from 58 +/- 12 nmol/L to 495 +/- 85 nmol/L (P<0.01) followed by a slow return to 257 +/- 3 nmol/L . During the 2-hour incubation, the Ca ionophore A 23187 (10(-8) mol/L) moderately but significantly stimulated endothelial ET synthesis. However, the Ca channel blocker verapamil, the intracellular Ca release blocker TMB-8, and nickel, a nonspecific calcium channel blocker, had no consistent effects on [Ca2+]i or ET synthesis. The protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 stimulated basal [Ca2+]i and cellular ET synthesis. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein suppressed the EPO-induced increase in [Ca2+]i and cellular ET synthesis. From these data we conclude that EPO can stimulate ET synthesis in vascular endothelial cells through activation of an EPO receptor and via intracellular signaling mechanisms involving tyrosine kinase activation and an increase in [Ca2+]i. Therefore, the systemic hypertensive effects of EPO may be due, at least in part, to local stimulation of vascular endothelial ET synthesis by calcium mobilization.",0,0
2089,9057069,Early captopril treatment reduces plasma endothelin concentrations in the acute and subacute phases of myocardial infarction: a pilot study.,,"Di Pasquale, P; Valdes, L; Albano, V; Bucca, V; Scalzo, S; Pieri, D; Maringhini, G; Paterna, S","Endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been reported to increase in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Experimental studies showed that administration of captopril reduces ET-1 secretion. In addition, it has been reported that the elevated ET-1 levels are a negative prognostic index. The aim of the study was to verify whether captopril can reduce plasma ET levels in the acute and subacute phases of reperfused anterior AMI. Forty-five patients hospitalized for suspected anterior AMI within 4 h of onset of symptoms and eligible for thrombolysis (first episode), Killip class I-2, were randomized (double-blind) into two groups: group A (23; seven women/16 men) received captopril (as the first dose) 2-4 h after the start of thrombolysis (the dose was then increased to 25 mg every 8 h). Group B (22; five women/17 men) received placebo after thrombolysis. All patients met the reperfusion criteria. The two groups were similar in terms of age, gender, peak CK, ejection fraction, end-systolic volume, and risk factors. Plasma ET levels were measured at baseline and 2, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after the start of thrombolysis. Mean concentrations of ET +/- SD: Group A basal, 1.50 +/- 0.67; at 2h, 2:31 +/- 1:24; 12h, 1.84 +/- 1.45; 24h, 1.30 +/- 0.72; 48h, 0.95 +/- 0.50; 72 h, 0.60 +/- 0.15 fmol/mL; p<0.001. Group B basal, 1.58 +/- 0.83; at 2 hours 2.38 +/- 1.35; 12h, 2.33 +/- 1.71; 24h, 1.80 +/- 1.41; 48h, 1.46 +/- 0.88; 72 h, 0.93 +/- 0.44 fmol/mL; p<0.001. The difference between the two groups was significant at the beginning of the test (between 2 and 12 h, p[=]0.002). Thereafter, plasma endothelin levels decreased in parallel, p<0.001. Our data suggest that captopril affects plasma ET levels in the acute and sub-acute phases of AMI.

The current study, the Nisoldipine Enalapril Anterior Myocardial Infarction Study Pilot Investigation, was designed to evaluate the effects of 12 weeks of treatment with enalapril or nisoldipine or their combination on left ventricular (LV) function and exercise capacity in patients with recent ( < 1 month ) anterior myocardial infarction and mild LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction [EF] 38% to 48%). Forty-six patients were studied and randomly assigned to receive enalapril (5 mg once daily) plus placebo (n=14) or nisoldipine (10 mg twice daily) plus placebo (n=18) or enalapril (5 mg once daily) plus nisoldipine (10th mg twice daily) (n=14). All patients received aspirin (325 mg) throughout the study. Data on LV EF and peak filling rate at rest and LV EF during exercise were collected during radionuclide ventriculography. In addition, the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure (frequency-pressure product) and the load time were determined during the stress test. The parameters analyzed were not significantly changed after treatment with enalapril or nisoldipine. In contrast, the combination of enalapril and nisoldipine significantly increased LV EF at rest (from 43% +/- 3% to 48% +/- 6%, p<0.01) and during exercise (from 45% +/- - 8% to 50% +/- 9%, p<0.01) and increased resting peak filling rate (fraction of end-diastolic volume per second) from 1.57 +/- 0.3 to 1.67 +/- 0, 3 (p<0.05). Furthermore, the combined administration of the two drugs increased the rate-pressure product (scores x 10(3)) (from 20.7 +/- 5 to 22.7 +/- 4, p<0.05) and increased the Training time (from 573 +/- 173 seconds to 668 +/- 178 seconds, p<0.05). These results demonstrate that in patients with recent anterior myocardial infarction and mild LV dysfunction, the combination of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and the dihydropyridine nisoldipine improves resting LV systolic and diastolic function and LV systolic function and exercise capacity during exercise .",0,0
2092,9061270,lisinopril. A review of its pharmacology and clinical efficacy in the elderly.,,"Langtry, H D; Markham, A","Lisinopril, the lysine analogue of enalaprilat, is a long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that is administered orally once daily. The effectiveness of lisinopril in lowering blood pressure is well established in younger populations, and many studies now show that it is effective in lowering blood pressure in elderly patients with hypertension. In comparative and non-comparative clinical trials, 68.2 to 89.1% of elderly patients (diastolic pressure < or = 90 mmHg) responded to > or = 8 weeks treatment with lisinopril. Age-related differences in antihypertensive efficacy do not appear to be clinically significant, and doses that are effective in elderly patients typically range from 2.5 to 40 mg/day. In patients with severely impaired kidney function, the dosages usually have to be lower. In congestive heart failure, lisinopril 2.5 to 20 mg/day prolongs exercise duration, improves left ventricular ejection fraction and has no significant effect on ventricular ectopic beats. It is similar in potency to enalapril and digoxin and similar or better than captopril for most endpoints. Data from the GISSI-3 post-myocardial infarction study show that lisinopril reduces mortality and left ventricular dysfunction when administered for 42 days beginning within 24 hours of the onset of infarction symptoms. Results at 6 weeks and 6 months were similar in older and younger patients. However, among other subgroups, elderly patients showed a strong reduction in the risk of low ejection fraction after treatment (-25.5%). Economic studies suggest that lisinopril is cost-effective in some markets compared to other ACE inhibitors. When administered according to the GISSI-3 protocol, lisinopril appears to be one of the more cost-effective of the successful ACE inhibitor therapies for acute myocardial infarction. In other studies, patients with diabetic nephropathy and high blood pressure improved or did not get worse during treatment with lisinopril. Blood pressure was monitored and reductions or tendencies to decrease in albuminuria were observed. These reductions were similar to those in recipients of diltiazem, nifedipine and verapamil and greater than in patients receiving atenolol. Lisinopril appears to reduce mortality in diabetics after myocardial infarction and may also improve diabetes-associated neuropathy. Lisinopril is well tolerated and the profile of side effects observed is typical for the ACE inhibitor class. There is a trend for more older than younger patients to discontinue treatment, but this trend is not clearly related to the incidence of adverse events in these age groups. Drug-drug interactions occur with few other agents and are usually clinically significant only between lisinopril and either diuretics or lithium. Lisinopril is therefore an effective treatment for elderly patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure and acute myocardial infarction, and has shown promising benefits in patients with diabetic nephropathy.",0,0

2094,9067912,A short-term decrease in glomerular filtration rate caused by antihypertensive treatment predicts long-term stability of renal function.,,"Apperloo, A J; de Zeeuw, D; de Jong, P E","In long-term intervention studies on renal function results, an initial drop in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can occur after the start of therapy. If this initial decrease in GFR is the result of a treatment-induced hemodynamic change reflecting a decrease in intraglomerular pressure, it should be reversible upon discontinuation of treatment, even after long-term treatment. In fact, it could be beneficial for kidney function in the long term. We therefore studied systemic and renal hemodynamics in 40 non-diabetic patients with renal impairment before treatment, during four years of treatment with either atenolol or enalapril, and after treatment discontinuation. The acute change in GFR 12 weeks after the start of treatment varied widely from -11 to +11 ml/min (mean +/- SD -1.0 +/- 4.1 ml/min, NS). After four years of treatment, withdrawal for 12 weeks resulted in an increase in GFR of +2.2 +/- 5.4 mL/min, P=0.011, again with a wide range of +14 to -6 mL/min). The initial decrease in GFR was related to the increase after weaning (r=0.32, P<0.05). Interestingly, the change in GFR induced by the acute treatment correlated with the long-term slope, such that a patient with a larger initial decrease in GFR showed a more stable course during follow-up (r = -0.36, P < 0.05). Patients were randomized into Group A (N=20) with the largest initial treatment-induced decrease in GFR and Group B (N=20) with the smallest initial decrease in GFR. Group A had a significantly less steep slope than Group B (-0.41 +/- 1.52 vs -2.09 +/- 2.79 mL/min/year, P=0.023) during the four-year follow-up. In group A, GFR increased again after stopping treatment (+3.8 +/- 5.6 mL/min, P=0.011), while in group B it did not change (+0.5 +/- 4, 0 mL/min, NS). As a result, post-treatment GFR in group A was not different from pre-treatment (-2.5 +/- 7.2 mL/min, NS), while in group B it was 5.9 +/- 12.1 ml/min was lower (P=0.023). Patients treated with enalapril had a similar response to patients treated with atenolol. In conclusion, an initial fall in GFR after initiation of antihypertensive treatment in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR 30 to 90 mL/min) is reversible even after years of treatment, suggesting that this treatment-induced fall hemodynamic and hemodynamic in nature is not of structural origin. This initial drop in GFR was associated with subsequent stable renal function. These data lead to the hypothesis that the initial decrease in GFR in response to antihypertensive therapy reflects renal protection.",0,0
2095,9068723,Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angioedema.,,"Sabroe, R A; Black, A K","Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are increasingly used to treat hypertension and chronic heart failure, and reduce mortality when administered after myocardial infarction. Among patients prescribed these drugs, 0.1-0.7% will develop angioedema, but the association is not universally recognized. In 60% of cases, onset occurs in the first week of treatment; however, it may be significantly delayed. Angioedema almost always occurs in the head and neck and commonly affects the mouth, tongue, pharynx, and larynx. The course is unpredictable and attacks vary in severity from mild to fatal due to laryngeal obstruction. Severe ACEI-induced angioedema may require emergency treatment with epinephrine and early intubation. The drug should be discontinued in any patient presenting with ACEI-induced angioedema and continued with an appropriate drug of a different class. Therapy with ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with a history of idiopathic angioedema or in patients with congenital or acquired C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency.",0,0

Danish Verapamil Infarction Trial (DAVIT) study group.,,"Hansen, J F; Hagerup, L; Sigurd, B; Pedersen, F; Mellemgaard, K; Pedersen-Bjergaard, O; Mortensen, L S","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve survival in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but mortality can be as high as 10% to 15% at one year. Verapamil prevents cardiac events after AMI in patients without CHF. We hypothesized that in post-infarction patients with CHF who were already prescribed diuretics and an ACE inhibitor, additional treatment with verapamil may reduce the cardiac event rate. In this multicentre, double-blind study, patients with CHF receiving treatment with diuretics were consecutively randomized to treatment with trandolapril 1 mg/day for 1 month and 2 mg/day for the following 2 months (n=49) or trandolapril, such as mentioned, plus verapamil 240 mg/day for 1 month and 360 mg/day for 2 months (n=51). Study medication started 3 to 10 days after AMI. All patients were followed for 3 months. Endpoints in the trandolapril/trandolapril-verapamil groups were death 1/1, reinfarction 7/1, unstable angina 9/3, and readmission for CHF 6/2. The rate of first cardiac events at 3 months was 35% in trandolapril-treated patients and 14% in trandolapril-verapamil-treated patients (hazard ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.85, p=0.015).

The primary endpoint was the tolerability measure of a sustained increase in serum creatinine of 26.5 µmol/L or greater (> or = 0.3 mg/dL) during therapy; the secondary endpoint was the composite of death and/or heart failure hospitalization; and other measures of efficacy were all-cause mortality, admission for heart failure, NYHA class, and admission for myocardial infarction or unstable angina; The frequency of sustained increases in serum creatinine was the same in both groups (10.5%). Fewer losartan patients discontinued therapy because of side effects (12.2% vs. 20.8% for captopril, p=0.002). None of the losartan-treated patients discontinued treatment because of cough, compared to 14 in the captopril group. Death and/or hospitalization for heart failure occurred in 9.4% of losartan and 13.2% of captopril patients (risk reduction 32% [95% CI -4% to +55%], p=0.075). This risk reduction was mainly due to a decrease in all-cause mortality (4.8% vs. 8.7%; risk reduction 46% [95% CI 5-69%], p=0.035). Heart failure admissions were the same in both groups (5.7%), as was improvement in NYHA functional class from baseline. Admissions to hospital for any reason were lower with losartan than with captopril treatment (22.2% vs. 29.7%). In this study of elderly patients with heart failure, treatment with losartan was associated with an unexpectedly lower mortality than with captopril.

A 36-week, open-label, randomized, controlled, multicentre study involving 189 physicians and 69 nurses was conducted in 155 primary and occupational health care centers in Finland. The study population consisted of 1156 patients aged 30-70 years (mean DBP 95-115 mmHg at the last three to five measurements during follow-up). The number of patients reaching the target pressure (DBP < 90 mmHg) at the end of the study, defined daily doses (DDD) of antihypertensive drugs and side effects in different treatment groups were considered as the main outcome parameters of the study. After exclusions and drop-outs, the final analysis was performed with 900 patients, 419 women (46.6%) and 481 men (53.4%). Patients treated with lisinopril reached target pressure significantly more often (p<0.001) than those who continued their prior or adjusted medication at 36 weeks (59.2 and 55.5% vs. 40.3 and 42.7% ). Only a small additional but not statistically significant blood pressure lowering effect was achieved with intensified non-pharmacological treatment at weeks 12 and 24, but this difference had disappeared by week 36. Female patients with prior or adjusted medication who did not receive health education, with the mean DDD was significantly (p<0.05) higher in this group at weeks 24 and 36. The side effect profile at the end of the study clearly favored the patients treated with lisinopril, with the exception of cough, which was reported in 18% of patients versus 10% in the control groups. 81 patients on lisinopril treatment were withdrawn from the study because of cough. The results showed that hypertensive patients with poor therapy control benefit from all three approaches. A greater proportion of patients on lisinopril treatment achieved target pressure and also had fewer side effects than those who continued an adjusted previous medication. Intensified personal health education delivered once a month for six months had little additional beneficial effect on achieving goal pressure, and this effect was lost three months after the health education phase.",0,0

Improvements in QoL were observed in all randomized groups, including the placebo group, during follow-up; Greater improvements were observed in the acebutolol and chlorthalidone groups and were evident throughout follow-up. The magnitude of weight loss, increase in physical activity, and level of blood pressure control achieved during follow-up were associated with greater improvements in QoL; In patients with stage I hypertension, antihypertensive treatment with any of the 5 agents used in TOMHS does not affect QoL. The diuretic chlorthalidone and the cardioselective beta-blocker acebutolol appear to improve quality of life the most.

The purpose of the Diab-Hycar study is to test the hypothesis that ACE inhibition with a low daily dose of 1.25 mg ramipril, which has no significant effect on blood pressure, reduces cardiovascular morbidity and/or mortality in normotensive or hypertensive NIDDM patients may decrease persistent albuminuria. 4000 patients, selected and followed by general practitioners, will receive their usual oral antidiabetic treatment and, if necessary, antihypertensive treatment (ACE inhibitors excluded). In addition, in a randomized, double-blind study, they received either a placebo or 1.25 mg of ramipril daily. The follow-up is currently scheduled for 3 years. Efficacy of ACE inhibition will be assessed using the following main endpoints: cardiovascular death, sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal replacement therapy. The Diab-Hycar study began on February 3, 1995. By September 1, 1995, 11,000 urine samples were tested. The prevalence of persistent albuminuria was 23%, 964 patients were initially enrolled in the study, 619 eligible patients were enrolled shortly thereafter. Various strategies have been developed to correctly capture cardiovascular events and minimize the number of patients lost to follow-up.",0,0
2102,9088591,The effect of the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor drug candoxatril on circulating levels of two of the most potent vasoactive peptides.,,"McDowell, G; Coutie, W; Shaw, C; Buchanan, K D; Struthers, A D; Nicholls, D P","Candoxatril is a specific inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) 24.11 and previous work has documented the effect of NEP inhibition on brain atrial and natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP). The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of NEP inhibition on circulating levels of vasoactive peptides.; We studied seven chronic heart failure patients who were randomized to receive candoxatril, candoxatril/captopril, captopril, and placebo in a double-blind four-way crossover design.; Mean circulating levels of endothelin (ET) were increased 2 h after placebo (10 to 20 pg ml-1) and also of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (27 to 51 pg ml-1), but ANP Levels meanwhile hardly changed this time (73 to 75 pg ml-1). However, after candoxatril, ET (10 to 39 pg ml-1, P<0.05), CGRP (34 to 99 pg ml-1, P<0.05) and ANP (72 to 108 pg ml-1, P<0.05) increased 0.05) on further. A similar result was observed after combined treatment with candoxatril and captopril.; We conclude that inhibition of neutral endopeptidase increases circulating plasma levels of ET and CGRP in addition to the natriuretic peptides.",0,0

A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, stratified comparison of lisinopril 10 mg, losartan 50 mg, and metolazone 1 mg, each once daily for a maximum of 10 weeks, was conducted in four hypertension clinics in four centers in two countries. Cough was assessed by a questionnaire (the primary endpoint) given to elderly patients with hypertension and cough frequency was quantified by a visual analogue scale (a secondary endpoint). A total of 84 elderly hypertensive patients, all non-smokers, with ACe inhibitor-induced cough, confirmed by lisinopril re-challenge followed by placebo dechallenge, were randomized to the three treatment groups. The incidence of cough was significantly lower with losartan (18%) than with lisinopril (97%) and similar to metolazone (21%). Cough frequency, assessed using the visual analogue scale, was significantly lower for losartan than for lisinopril and similar to that for metolazone. The specific, selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan is associated with a decrease in the incidence of cough in patients with a prior ACE inhibitor-induced cough.",0,0

The study group consisted of 29 elderly patients with hypertension (mean age 69 years) who were divided into two groups: 15 patients received nifedipine (group N) and 14 received enalapril (group E). In group N, systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased and percent changes in low-frequency coefficient of component variance, normalized low-frequency:high-frequency ratio, and plasma norepinephrine concentration were significantly altered by nifedipine administration. In contrast, group E showed no significant decrease in SBP, and only the percent change in high frequency coefficient of component variance increased significantly after enalapril administration. These results suggest that cardiac autonomic nerve function during the tilt test is markedly impaired after long-term treatment with nifedipine, while it is well preserved after long-term treatment with enalapril.",0,0

2108,9104905,Effect of antithrombotic therapy on the risk of sudden coronary death in patients with congestive heart failure.,,"Dries, D L; Domanski, M J; Waclawiw, M A; Gersh, B J","Data from epidemiological, autopsy, Holter surveillance, and electrophysiological studies support the hypothesis that acute myocardial ischemia, even in the absence of myocardial infarction, is a critical component of the pathophysiology of sudden coronary death. Acute myocardial ischemia superimposed on ventricles damaged by previous infarcts has been shown to enhance the generation of fatal ventricular arrhythmias. This is a retrospective analysis of 6,797 participants in the left ventricular dysfunction prevention and treatment trials. Both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to study the association of anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs with the risk of sudden cardiac death. The following covariates were adjusted in the analysis: age, ejection fraction, gender, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, history of angina, prior myocardial infarction, prior revascularization, and regular use of beta-blockers, diuretics, digoxin, antiarrhythmics, or enalapril. The overall incidence of sudden cardiac death per 100 patient-years of follow-up was 2.24%. In the multivariate analysis, antiplatelet and anticoagulant monotherapy were each independently associated with a reduction in the risk of sudden cardiac death: antiplatelet with a 24% reduction (relative risk [RR] 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61 -0.95) and antiplatelet monotherapy with a 32% reduction (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.48-0.96).

This paper describes an attempt to address this difficulty. ACE activity in serum and uncentrifuged skeletal muscle homogenates was measured by a fluorometric assay before and during treatment in 24 fosinopril-treated and 26 atenolol-treated hypertensive patients. The absolute difference in activity between the higher and lower of two different sample dilutions divided by the mean activity was taken to represent competitive inhibition in the sample, ""Inhibitor Index"". The reduction in muscle ACE activity associated with fosinopril treatment was not statistically significant (-2.6%, p=0.68). However, the inhibitor index increased by 46% (p=0.045) and no change was seen in the atenolol-treated group (-12%, p=0.51). Change in muscle inhibitory index (but not reduction in serum ACE activity) was inversely correlated with change in blood pressure (r = -0.50, p = 0.034) and serum aldosterone (r = -0, 54, p=0.031) in fosinopril group but not in atenolol group. In a second study, the serum inhibitor index increased by 0.28 (95% CI 0.24-0.32) in 12 patients treated with trandolapril but remained unchanged in 11 patients treated with atenolol (+0.0097, 95 %CI -0.029-0.048).

Of the patients treated with carvedilol, 8 did exercise and 8 remained sedentary. All 7 patients treated with propranolol underwent physical training. The maximum oxygen consumption (ml.kg-1.min-1) was measured serially in trained and sitting patients. Maximum reactive hyperemia (ml.min - 1100 ml -1 ) was determined in the calf and forearm immediately before and after 12 weeks of training. Peak oxygen consumption of trained patients treated with either carvedilol or propranolol increased from 12.9 +/- 1.4 to 16.0 +/- 1.6 (P < 0.001) and from 12.4 +/- 1 .0 to 15.7 +/- 0.9 (P < 0.001) ml.kg-1.min-1, while it did not change in the sedentary patients.

Our hypothesis is that ACE inhibitors improve lung function in chronic heart failure (CHF) by readjusting the tone and permeability of the pulmonary vessels or the diffusion of the alveolar-capillary membrane.; In 16 CHF patients and 16 healthy volunteers or mild untreated hypertensive subjects, pulmonary function and exercise tests with breath analysis were randomized and double-blind to assess placebo, enalapril (10 mg twice daily), enalapril plus aspirin (325 mg/d), or aspirin, for 15 days each. In CHF, enalapril increased pulmonary carbon monoxide diffusion (DLCO), oxygen consumption (VO2) and exercise tolerance and reduced the dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) and respiratory equivalent for carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2). With enalapril, VO2 (r=0.80, p<0.0001) and VD/VT (r=-0.69, p=0.003) changes from placebo correlated with those with DLCO. These effects were inhibited by aspirin and absent in controls. In 8 additional patients, hydralazine isosorbide dinitrate as an alternative treatment for reducing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and increasing exercise capacity was more effective than enalapril for PCWP but had no effect on DLCO and VE/VCO2; improvement in VO2 and VD/VT was unrelated to DLCO and was not altered by aspirin; ACE inhibition improved pulmonary diffusion in CHF. Hydralazine isosorbide dinitrate did not provide this result. Counteraction by aspirin, a prostaglandin inhibitor, suggests prostaglandin involvement during enalapril intake, which may readjust capillary permeability or alveolar-capillary membrane diffusion.",0,0

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 39 physically active men with uncomplicated essential hypertension, we compared the effects of atenolol and enalapril on cardiovascular fitness and serum lipids. The drugs (atenolol, 50 or 100 mg once daily; enalapril, 10 or 20 mg once daily) were each administered for 4 weeks, and each phase of action was preceded by 4 weeks of placebo therapy. Both drugs were effective (p<0.001) in reducing resting blood pressure measured at the theoretical peak (ie, 3 to 4 hours post-dose) and trough (ie, 24 hours post-drug) drug blood levels. Atenolol reduced maximal oxygen uptake (by 7.3%, p<0.001) 3 to 4 but not 24 hours after drug dosing; no changes occurred with enalapril. While serum lipids remained essentially unchanged with enalapril, serum triglycerides (18.9% increase), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (10.6% decrease), and the ratio of low-density to high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol increased (15.4% increase) adversely affected (p < or = 0.05) with atenolol.

We also analyzed changes in left ventricular volume after study drug discontinuation. Decreased dilatation of the left ventricle is one of the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition after AMI. However, the nature of this effect is not fully understood; We enrolled 89 patients within 48 hours of initiating a first AMI and left ventricular radionuclide ejection fraction less than 45%. The study was double-blind and compared enalapril and placebo in a crossover design. All patients were randomized to sequence A (enalapril, 45 days; placebo, 45 days) or B (placebo, 45 days; enalapril, 45 days). The endpoint was the change in left ventricular volume at 45 and 90 days. 26 patients (70%) in Group A and 25 (75%) in Group B received thrombolysis. All pre-treatment clinical variables were similar in both groups. Median and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of left ventricular diastolic volumes were 46.8 mL/m2 (39 to 61 mL/m2) and 46.6 mL/m2 (39 to 60 mL/m2) for groups A and B, respectively. The end-systolic baseline volumes were 28.5 mL/m2 (20 to 36 mL/m2) and 28.9 mL/m2 (23 to 28 mL/m2) in the same groups. Placebo treatment during the first 45 days was associated with an 8.75 mL/m2 (95% CI, 3.25 to 17.1 mL/m2; p<0.01) increase in left ventricular diastolic volume and end-systolic volume associated by 4.20 mL/m2 (95.0% CI, 0.00 to 10.1 mL/m2, p<0.05). No significant changes were observed during other phases of the study. At 45 days, left ventricular diastolic volume was 11.1 mL/m2 (95% CI, 0.5 to 2.2 mL/m2), greater in placebo-treated patients compared to patients receiving enalapril; In patients with a first Q-wave AMI and a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%, treatment with enalapril can prevent left ventricular dilatation. This protective effect involves, at least in part, a structural modification of the left ventricle. Therefore, the maximum benefit can only be achieved if treatment is started early.",1,0

2118,9116923,Captopril does not dampen the sympathoadrenal response to cigarette smoking in normotensive individuals.,,"Ottesen, M M; Worck, R; Ibsen, H","The aim of this study was to assess whether there is an interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system at the level of the adrenal medulla during smoking in normal people. Thirteen habitually smoking volunteers were studied in a randomized, double-blind, single-dose, crossover design using 50 mg captopril vs. placebo, followed by smoking two high-nicotine cigarettes within 15 minutes. Blood samples were taken at regular intervals before, during and after smoking. We found that the increase in plasma adrenaline concentration during cigarette smoking was small. There was no difference between treatment with captopril compared to placebo. Thus, the adrenaline response to cigarette smoking was not blunted by acute blockade of angiotensin II production. A significant increase in heart rate and blood pressure was also noted. No increase in plasma concentration of norepinephrine was detected. The plasma renin concentration increased significantly during treatment with captopril, while it decreased in the placebo phase throughout the study period. Plasma angiotensin II concentration decreased in both captopril and placebo treatment throughout the study period, but this was more pronounced during captopril treatment. In conclusion, cigarette smoking-induced sympathetic nervous system activation was not attenuated by acute ACE inhibition by captopril. This indicates that angiotensin II does not facilitate smoking-induced activation of sympathoadrenal activity in humans.",0,0

However, whether ABP is better at predicting the development or regression of organ damage over time than clinical BP is unknown.; In 206 patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), before and after 12 months of treatment with lisinopril (20 mg UID) without or before and after 12 months of treatment, we measured supine blood pressure in the hospital, 24-hour ABP and left ventricular mass index (LVMI, echocardiography) measured with hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 or 25 mg UID). Measurements included random null, clinical orthostatic, and home BP. A total of 184 subjects completed the 12-month treatment phase. Before treatment, clinical supine blood pressure was 165 +/- 15/105 +/- 5 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic), mean 24-hour BP was 149 +/- 16/95 +/- 11 mm Hg and LVMI 158 +/- 32 g/m2.

Before treatment, LVMI did not correlate with clinical blood pressure, but did show a correlation with 24-hour mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r=0.34/0.27, P<0.01). The LVMI reduction was not associated with the reduction in clinical blood pressure but with the reduction in 24-hour mean BP (r=0.42/0.38, P<0.01). Treatment-emergent changes in mean daytime and nighttime blood pressure correlated with LVMI changes as strongly as 24-hour blood pressure changes. No significant benefit over clinical supine blood pressure was demonstrated by orthostatic, random zero, and home blood pressure in the clinic; In hypertensive patients with LVH, treatment-induced changes in arterial blood pressure predicted regression of LVH much more accurately than clinical blood pressure. This provides the first longitudinally controlled evidence that ABP may be clinically superior to traditional blood pressure measurements.",0,0

Eleven hypertensive patients who developed a cough induced by an ACE inhibitor, a TXA2 synthetase inhibitor, were given Ozagrel for 1 to 2 months along with the ACE inhibitors. One patient developed Ozagrel-induced headache and was withdrawn from the study after 3 weeks. In the other 10 patients, no apparent drug-related abnormality was observed in subjective and objective symptoms or laboratory tests. Cough scores were collected in ten patients immediately before and after administration of a combination of an ACE inhibitor and Ozagrel. The median cough scores after the combination were significantly (p=0.012) lower than before the combination. Ozagrel reduced cough scores in 5 patients, completely suppressed the cough in 3 patients, and in 2 of 10 patients, Ozagrel had no effect on cough scores. Our observations suggest that TXA2 may somehow mediate the cough induced by the ACE inhibitors. In addition, patients on ACE inhibitors who develop cough may benefit from TXA2 synthetase inhibitors.",0,0

The CONSENSUS II Holter Substudy Group.,,"SÃ¸gaard, P; Thygesen, K","The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between early hemodynamic instability and myocardial ischemia and the effect of early intravenous therapy with enalapril on this relationship. In patients with myocardial infarction (MI), early treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is controversial. In patients with hypotension, initiation of treatment may exacerbate myocardial ischemia and thereby affect the clinical outcome. Therefore, in the CONSENSUS II study, a total of 60 patients, randomized to receive either intravenous enalapril or placebo within 24 hours of the onset of myocardial infarction, were evaluated through repeated blood pressure measurements, pre-discharge ambulatory ST-segment monitoring, and exercise stress testing examined. Significant ST depression was present in 34 patients. Patients with pre-discharge ST depression (residual ischemia) during either exercise stress testing or ambulatory monitoring or both had a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) at baseline of 20 vs 9 mm Hg in patients without ST depression (n=24), ( p<0.00001). However, patients (n = 13) with long-lasting ST depression during Holter monitoring (> 60 min ST depression) showed the largest drop in MAP of 29 mm Hg (p < 0.00001) and lower blood systolic pressure at inclusion (p<0.01) compared to the rest of the patients. In addition, the number of recurrent acute ischemic events during follow-up was higher in these patients (7 vs. 1; p<0.01). Ten of the enalapril-treated patients demonstrated long-lasting ST depression compared to only 3 in the placebo group (p=0.08), and the mean duration of all significant ST depressions during Holter monitoring was significantly longer in the enalapril-treated group. group compared to the placebo group (p<0.05). Finally, 7 enalapril patients (20%) experienced an acute ischemic event versus 1 patient (4%) in the placebo group (p=0.07). In conclusion, early administration of enalapril in patients prone to hypotension had a potential proischemic effect mediated by an exacerbation of the hemodynamic response, since the initial fall in blood pressure after MI is associated with residual myocardial ischemia and recurrent acute ischemic syndromes related.",0,0

Covariates other than drug choice, such as Pretreatment LV mass, body weight, extent of blood pressure reduction, race, and age may alter LV mass response to therapy.; In a double-blind study, patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 109 mm Hg) were randomized to treatment with atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, hydrochlorothiazide or prazosin. Patients who achieved target diastolic blood pressure of < 90 mmHg during drug titration entered a 1-year maintenance phase. Longitudinal analysis examined changes in LV mass from baseline echocardiogram at 8 weeks and 1 year, statistically adjusted for pre-treatment LV mass, systolic blood pressure, body weight, sodium excretion, physical activity, race and the age. Significant reductions in adjusted LV mass at 1 year were observed in patients in the highest tertile of pre-treatment LV mass treated with hydrochlorothiazide (mean -42.9; 95% CI -65.5; -20.2 g) , captopril (mean, -38.7; 95% confidence limits, -61.0, -16.4 g) and atenolol (mean, -28.1; 95% confidence limits, -50.9, -5.3 g). These treatment effects differed from those of prazosin, diltiazem, or clonidine.; Antihypertensive drugs have variable effects on LV mass, independent of the extent of blood pressure reduction. Patients with adequate blood pressure control on captopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and atenolol show a reduction in LV mass after one year of treatment, while this is not the case in patients on diltiazem, clonidine, or prazosin.",0,0

After a 4-week washout period, 34 patients (17 M, 17 F) aged 22 to 67 years were randomized in a multicenter, open-label, parallel design: 17 received lisinopril (10-20 mg) and 17 received enalapril (10-20 mg ). 20 mg) for a period of 12 weeks. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM) monitoring was performed using an oscillometric noninvasive automated device both at the end of the 4-week baseline drug-free period and during the last week of treatment. Because there were no differences in baseline blood pressure (BP) between the groups, both drugs significantly reduced Office and ABPM scores. Lisinopril tended to reduce blood pressure to a greater extent than enalapril, but only reductions in office systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p=0.0062), 24-hour SBP exercise (p=0.0182) and of nocturnal SBP exposure (p = 0.0316) reached statistical significance.

After a 1-month placebo run-in period, 140 hypertensive patients with an average sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95-114 mmHg were randomized to receive either moexipril 7.5 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg once daily or Metoprolol 100 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg for the post 12-week double-blind treatment period. At biweekly visits, blood pressure was checked by sphygmomanometer and the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) was documented. At study endpoint, the adjusted mean reductions in sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressure for both combinations were -17.6 mm Hg/-12.8 mm Hg and -17.2 mm Hg/-13.9 mm Hg in the moexipril/HCTZ or metoprolol/HCTZ group. The response rate to both types of combinations was very similar, 69% and 74% in the moexipril/HCTZ and metoprolol/HCTZ groups, respectively. The percentage of patients who experienced one or more AEs was 46% in the moexipril/HCTZ and 61% in the metoprolol/HCTZ group. Headache and cough, the most commonly reported adverse events after treatment with ACE inhibitors, were observed in 9% and 10% of patients in the moexipril/HCTZ group compared to 10% and 4% in the metoprolol/HCTZ group .

Contrary to popular belief, the monstrosity of keeping up with more recently developed drugs is not a modern phenomenon attributed to the major technological advances of recent years, but an ongoing struggle spanning the second half of this century. It seems there's more to drugs than knowing how, when, or what to do with them.

Patients were stratified by grade of GFR and proteinuria and randomized to receive either isradipine (N=16) or captopril (N=15); Doses were adjusted to maintain similar blood pressure readings (<140/90). At 6 months, mean arterial pressure was similar (102 +/- 3 and 104 +/- 3 mmHg in the isradipine and captopril groups, respectively) and GFR unchanged (delta = -4 +/- 3 and +1 +/- - 3 ml/min/1.73 in isradipine and captopril groups, respectively; P = NS).

A final patient population of 23 asymptomatic adults aged 53.3 +/- 2.4 years (mean +/- SEM) with fair organic MR and normal left ventricular function was selected from the echocardiographic database. All baseline patient characteristics were comparable between the two treatment groups, including the MR fraction (55 +/- 3%). Twelve patients received lisinopril (18 +/- 1 mg) and 11 received placebo. After one year of treatment, a statistically significant difference in MR fraction was observed between the two groups. In the lisinopril group, the MR fraction decreased by 6.4 +/- 3.5% and in the placebo group it increased by 3.7 +/- 3.2% from baseline (p<0.05) . No differences in left atrial or ventricular dimensions were observed. The study drug was discontinued in four patients after rapid atrial fibrillation and angina developed in one patient, while three patients were intolerant to lisinopril. Only one patient who received placebo was withdrawn from therapy. In conclusion, treatment with lisinopril suggests some reduction in the severity of chronic moderate MI in asymptomatic patients with normal left ventricular function. This approach seems safe, but side effects are not uncommon, warranting regular follow-up.",0,0
2147,9179532,lisinopril. A review of its pharmacology and use in the management of the complications of diabetes mellitus.,,"Goa, K L; Haria, M; Wilde, M I","Like other ACE inhibitors, lisinopril lowers blood pressure and maintains renal function in hypertensive patients with non-insulin dependent or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM or IDDM) and early or established nephropathy without affecting glycemic control or lipid profiles. Based on the available evidence, the renoprotective effects of lisinopril appear to be greater than those of comparable calcium channel blockers, diuretics and beta-blockers, despite similar antihypertensive efficacy. As the EUCLID study (EUrodiab Controlled Trial of Lisinopril in Insulin-Dependent Diabetes) showed, lisinopril is also renoprotective in normotensive patients with IDDM and microalbuminuria. The effect in normotensive patients with normoalbuminuria was less than in patients with microalbuminuria and no conclusions can yet be drawn on the use in patients with normoalbuminuria. For complications other than nephropathy, lisinopril has shown some benefit. Retinopathy progression was slowed during 2 years of lisinopril therapy in the EUCLID study. Although not yet fully published, these results provide the most compelling evidence to date for an effect of an ACE inhibitor in retinopathy. The drug may also improve neurological function, but this finding is preliminary. Finally, a post-hoc analysis of the GISSI-3 study shows that lisinopril reduces 6-week mortality rates in diabetics when started as early treatment after an acute myocardial infarction. The tolerability profile of lisinopril is typical for ACE inhibitors and appears to be similar in diabetics and non-diabetics. As shown in the EUCLID study, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar between lisinopril and placebo. In addition, the GISSI-3 study indicates that the incidence of persistent hypotension and renal dysfunction is generally increased with lisinopril, but the presence of diabetes does not appear to confer an additional risk of these events in diabetics with acute myocardial infarction receiving lisinopril . In summary, lisinopril lowers blood pressure and produces a renoprotective effect in patients with IDDM and NIDDM without affecting glycemic control or lipid profiles. Therefore, like other ACE inhibitors, lisinopril should be considered the drug of first choice for lowering blood pressure and for preventing or attenuating nephropathy in hypertensive diabetics with IDDM or NIDDM and microalbuminuria or overt renal disease. The EUCLID study using lisinopril provides new data supporting an additional place in the treatment of normotensive blood pressure patients with microalbuminuria and IDDM. These results, along with some evidence of an effect of lisinopril in delaying the progression of retinopathy and reducing mortality, suggest a broader role for the drug in the management of diabetic vascular complications.",0,0

Changes (delta) from baseline in BP, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) were measured. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP decreased significantly and to a similar extent in randomized groups: fosinopril (mean +/- SEM) delta DBP at 6 weeks was -13 +/- 2 (p<0.0001; 95% CI, -16 to -9) and at 22 weeks -12 +/- 2 (p<0.0001; 95% CI, -16 to -9); Lisinopril delta DBP was -14 +/- 6 (P<0.0001; 95% CI, -10 to -18) at 6 weeks and -16 +/- 2 (P<0.0001; 95% CI) at 22 weeks , -12). to -21). GFR and RPF did not change significantly in either group.

Eight patients (five Black and three non-Black) required furosemide addition at 6 weeks to achieve the DBP goal of < or = 90 mm Hg at 22 weeks. GFR was not significantly changed for any of the race groups at 6 weeks; however, after 22 weeks; however, at 22 weeks, GFR decreased significantly in blacks (delta GFR, -16 +/- 5; P<0.006; 95% CI, -26 to -5) and tended to increase in non-blacks (delta GFR, 7 +/- 6; P > 0.25). Delta GFR correlated directly with delta RPF (delta GFR = 0.0611* delta RPF -2.35+; r = 0.68; P < 0.003). There was no correlation between delta MAP and delta GFR or delta RPF in blacks or non-blacks. We conclude that chronic ACE inhibition with fosinopril and lisinopril alone or in combination with furosemide lowers blood pressure in elderly black and non-black people with hypertension and chronic renal failure.

Aspirin (ASA) has become a well-documented therapeutic adjunct in patients with coronary artery disease. Recently, attention has been focused on a possible interaction between ASA and ACE inhibitors. We therefore reanalyzed data from the Cooperative New Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study II (CONSENSUS II) to find evidence of differential effects of the ACE inhibitor enalapril in subgroups defined by use of ASA at baseline. Logistic regression tested multiplicative interaction. We used the Rothman synergy index S, which would be equal to one for additivity and less than one for antagonism, to study the proposed interaction with deviation from an additive model. Logistic regression showed that the enalapril ASA interaction term was a significant predictor of mortality at the end of the study (p=0.047) and a borderline significant predictor of mortality at 30 days post-randomization (p=0.085). The Rothman synergy index S was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.94) for end-of-study mortality and 0.68 (0.44 to 1.04) for 30-day mortality, which suggesting an antagonism between enalapril and ASA, deviating from an additive model. Thus, we found evidence of an interaction between enalapril and ASA. The effect of enalapril was less favorable in patients taking ASA than in patients not taking ASA at baseline.",0,0

An early arm of low-dose ramipril (0.625 mg) was also evaluated. Clinical events did not differ. During the first 14 days, the risk of developing systolic arterial pressure < or = 90 mmHg was increased in both ramipril groups.

Clinical pharmacokinetics and clinical potential.,,"Shionoiri, H; Naruse, M; Minamisawa, K; Ueda, S; Himeno, H; Hiroto, S; Takasaki, I","Fosinopril is a phosphorus ester prodrug of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It is hydrolysed mainly in the gastrointestinal mucosa and the liver to the active diacid fosinoprilat, which has unique pharmacological properties. The majority of the active moieties of other ACE inhibitors are excreted in the urine. This means that in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment, adjustment of dosage and/or dosing interval is required to reduce drug accumulation and the possibility of excessive hypotension or other side effects. On the other hand, fosinoprilat is excreted in both urine and bile (as with temocaprilat, zofenoprilat and spiraprilat) and therefore adjustment of dosage and/or dosing interval may be unnecessary in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment as renal function is affected little the pharmacokinetics of fosinoprilat. In addition, the available data indicate that the pharmacokinetic variables of fosinoprilat in patients on hemodialysis were similar to those in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Dose adjustments or additional dose administrations after dialysis may be unnecessary. The antihypertensive effect of the combination of fosinopril and a diuretic is synergistic. Pharmacokinetic interactions with fosinopril are unlikely in patients receiving thiazides or loop diuretics. Fosinopril has beneficial effects for patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy as it produces an adequate lowering of blood pressure and reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy. There are a large number of studies on the pharmacokinetics of fosinopril. However, there are far fewer studies on the pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs.

We conducted a prospective, randomized, parallel study over 42 months, double-blind for the first 12 months and single-blind thereafter. Forty-three (21 lisinopril and 22 atenolol) hypertensive NIDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy were enrolled. Data are presented from 36 patients (17 lisinopril and 19 atenolol, 60 +/- 7 years old, 27 males) who completed at least 12 months of the study period. At baseline, the two groups were comparable: glomerular filtration rate (51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance) was 75 +/- 6 and 74 +/- 8 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2), mean 24 h ambulatory blood pressure (A&D TM2420) was 110 +/- 3 and 114 +/- 2 mmHg, and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion rates were 961 (range 331-5727) and 1578 (476-5806) mg/24, respectively h in the lisinopril or atenolol groups. The mean follow-up time was similar, 37 and 35 months in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. Mean ambulatory blood pressure was equally reduced in both groups, 12 +/- 2 and 10 +/- 2 mmHg in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. Glomerular filtration rate decreased biphasically with a more rapid initial (0 to 6 months) change of 1.25 +/- 0.49 and 0.81 +/- 0.29 mL x min(-1) x month(-1), followed by a slower sustained decline (6 to 42 months) of 0.59 +/- 0.10 and 0.54 +/- 0.13 mL x min(-1) x month(-1) in the lisinopril and .Atenolol group. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in either initial or sustained decline in glomerular filtration rate.

Sporadic cases of angioedema secondary to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) have been reported in the literature. The overall incidence is approximately 0.1% to 0.2% and the time of onset is usually within the first week of ACEI therapy. Late onset angioedema as a consequence of treatment with ACEIs is much more common than previously thought and goes largely unrecognized due to the lack of a temporal correlation between ACEI therapy and the development of angioedema. Since angioedema can lead to upper airway obstruction, otolaryngologists need to be aware of this association. Most importantly, late onset angioedema alerts the clinician to discontinue ACEI immediately to prevent further morbidity. This report presents an example of late-onset angioedema induced by accidental ingestion of a double dose of captopril.

2166,9211084,fosinopril. A review of its pharmacology and clinical efficacy in the treatment of heart failure.,,"Davis, R; Coukell, A; McTavish, D","Fosinopril is the prodrug of the active diacid ACE inhibitor fosinoprilat. In patients with heart failure, fosinopril reduces pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial pressure, mean right atrial pressure and heart rate, and increases stroke volume index and cardiac index. The drug has compensatory dual elimination pathways via the renal and hepatic systems and accumulates to a lesser extent than enalapril and lisinopril in patients with chronic renal failure, with or without heart failure. Comparative studies of 3 or 6 months duration with fosinopril 10 to 40 mg/day in patients with heart failure [mostly New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III] have shown clinical efficacy significantly superior to placebo. Treatment with fosinopril consistently increased exercise duration and improved heart failure symptoms in these patients. Significantly fewer fosinopril than placebo recipients discontinued treatment or were hospitalized for worsening heart failure. In addition, significantly more fosinopril than placebo recipients showed improvement and fewer patients worsened in NYHA functional class. Fosinopril and enalapril showed similar clinical efficacy over 6 and 12 months of treatment in patients with NYHA functional class II to IV heart failure. To date, there are no data demonstrating a mortality benefit of fosinopril. Fosinopril was well tolerated in clinical trials in patients with heart failure. Dizziness (11.9 vs. 5.4% for placebo), cough (9.7 vs. 5.1%) and hypotension (4.4 vs. 0.8%) were the most commonly reported adverse reactions. In 6- or 12-month comparative studies, treatment with fosinopril was associated with a lower incidence of dizziness and hypotension but a higher incidence of dizziness than treatment with enalapril. 0.8% of patients discontinued the drug because of cough, which was similar in severity to fosinopril and enalapril.

After a 15-day placebo run-in period, 105 patients with moderate essential hypertension (mean age 52 years) underwent a 24-hour blood pressure measurement (Spacelabs: 1 measurement/15 min). Patients were divided into two groups: the ""high"" group with 24-hour mean values of systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 137 or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 87 mm Hg and the ""low"" group with SBP < or = 137 and DBP < or = 87 mmHg. All patients received either bisoprolol (10 mg qd) or lisinopril (20 mg qd) in a randomized and double-blind design for 8 weeks. At the end of this active treatment period, ambulatory and ambulatory blood pressure measurements were performed. Incidental measurements showed similar blood pressure reductions in all subgroups receiving bisoprolol and lisinopril; Blood pressure monitoring showed that the antihypertensive effect was dependent on the 24-hour mean baseline; -15/-12 mm Hg for bisoprolol and -18/-13 mm Hg for lisinopril in the high group; -7/-6 mm Hg for bisoprolol and -6/-6 mm Hg for lisinopril in the low group. This study shows that the antihypertensive effect depends on the initial ambulatory blood pressure readings, with a smaller drop in blood pressure in the low group. Evaluation of the antihypertensive effect on ambulatory blood pressure is useful in clinical trials.",0,0
2168,9215232,Rationale and design features of a clinical trial investigating the effects of cholesterol-lowering and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on coronary atherosclerosis: Simvastatin/Enalapril Coronary Atherosclerosis Trial (SCAT). SCAT investigators.,,"Teo, K K; Burton, J R; Buller, C; Plante, S; Yokoyama, S; Montague, T J","In the treatment of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CAD), the mechanisms by which lipid lowering, an established therapy, produces beneficial clinical effects remain unclear. In addition, there are no conclusive data from clinical trials primarily evaluating the anti-ischemic effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in patients with normal cardiac function, although potential mechanisms of action are well known and increasingly applied clinically. The Simvastatin/Enalapril Coronary Atherosclerosis Trial (SCAT) aims to clarify some of these issues in CAD patients with normal or mildly elevated cholesterol. DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES: SCAT is a three- to five-year, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2-factorial study designed to evaluate the effects of cholesterol-lowering therapy by simvastatin and/or ACE inhibition by enalapril on anatomical coronary artery atherosclerosis progression by quantitative coronary angiography in CAD patients with preserved left ventricular function and total cholesterol between 4.1 and 6.2 mmol/L; Of 460 patients (age 61 +/- 9 years; 409 males, 51 females) enrolled in the study between June 1991 and July 1995, 230 were randomized to simvastatin and 230 to placebo and 229 to enalapril and 231 to placebo. Mean total cholesterol at baseline was 5.20 +/- 0.61 mmol/L, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 0.99 +/- 0.25 mmol/L, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 3 .36 +/- 0.57 mmol/L and triglycerides at 1.82 +/- 0.75 mmol/L. The trial will be completed in June 1998.; The knowledge gained from this long-term angiographic study will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of these two treatments, both alone and in combination. Of particular interest is that this study will be able to examine a putative beneficial interaction, if any, between these two treatments.",0,0
2169,9217714,Thromboxane antagonism and cough induced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Malini, P L; Strocchi, E; Zanardi, M; Milani, M; Ambrosioni, E","It has been suggested that the increased prostaglandin synthesis that may follow stimulation of the arachidonic acid cascade by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-I) inhibition underlies the occurrence of cough during ACE-I treatment. We examined whether the prostanoid thromboxane was involved.; Nine patients with essential hypertension who developed a cough after enalapril 20 mg once daily (cough) were treated with placebo or picotamide 600 mg twice daily while continuing to receive enalapril in a double-blind, crossover study. Picotamide is an antiplatelet agent that acts both by inhibiting thromboxane synthase and by antagonizing thromboxane receptors. Thirteen patients with hypertension without a history of ACE-I-induced cough were also treated with enalapril and served as controls. Cough frequency was measured by a visual analogue scale and by a daily cough diary. The 24-hour urinary recovery of 11-dehydro-thromboxane-B2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was measured to assess changes in endoperoxide metabolism over the study periods.; Recovery of 11-dehydro-thromboxane-B2 (TXB2) was significantly reduced by picotamide, resulting in cough resolution in eight patients within 72 h. Data on urinary recovery of picotamide indicated incomplete absorption in the non-responder. At baseline and after rechallenge with enalapril, 11-dehydro-TXB2 excretion was in the same range in controls and coughs, but the latter showed significantly lower excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and their ratio of 11-dehydroTXB2 to 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was twice that in controls (1.40 [95% CI 0.86-1.95] vs. 0.61 [0.37-0.84]); A thromboxane antagonist is effective in ACE-I-induced cough. An imbalance between thromboxane and prostacyclin may represent a marker for patients susceptible to ACE-I-induced cough.",0,0
2170,9217756,Randomized placebo-controlled study of the effect of ramipril on decreasing glomerular filtration rate and risk of end-stage renal disease in proteinuric nondiabetic nephropathy. The GISEN Group (Gruppo Italiano di Studi Epidemiologici in Nefrologia),,,"In diabetic nephropathy, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a greater effect than other antihypertensive drugs on proteinuria and the progressive decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Whether this difference applies to the progression of non-diabetic proteinuric nephropathies is not clear. The ramipril study of efficacy in nephropathy in chronic non-diabetic nephropathies aimed to investigate whether glomerular protein trafficking influences kidney disease progression and whether an ACE inhibitor compared to conventional treatment with equal blood pressure control in reducing proteinuria, limiting the decrease the GFR, is superior. and prevention of end-stage renal disease.; In this prospective double-blind study, 352 patients were classified by baseline proteinuria (stratum 1: 1-3 g/24 h; stratum 2: > or = 3 g/24 h) and randomly assigned to ramipril or placebo plus conventional antihypertensive therapy based on it aims to achieve a diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg. The primary endpoint was the rate of decrease in GFR. The analysis was intended to treat.; At the second planned interim analysis, the difference in GFR reduction between the ramipril and placebo groups in stratum 2 was highly significant (p=0.001). The independent review panel therefore decided to open the randomization code and perform the final analysis at this stratum (Layer 1 continued in the study). Data (at least three GFR measurements including baseline) were available for 56 ramipril-treated patients and 61 placebo-treated patients. The decrease in GFR per month was significantly less in the ramipril group than in the placebo group (0.53 [0.08] vs. 0.88 [0.13] ml/min, p=0.03). In ramipril-treated patients, the percent reduction in proteinuria was inversely correlated with the decrease in GFR (p=0.035) and predicted the reduction in risk of doubling of baseline creatinine or end-stage renal failure (18 ramipril vs. 40 placebo, p=0, 04). The risk of progression was also significantly reduced after adjustment for changes in systolic (p = 0.04) and diastolic (p = 0.04) blood pressure, but not after adjustment for changes in proteinuria. Blood pressure control and the total number of cardiovascular events were similar in the two treatment groups.; In chronic nephropathies with proteinuria of 3 g or more per 24 h, ramipril safely reduces proteinuria and the rate of GFR decline to an extent that appears to exceed the reduction expected for the magnitude of blood pressure reduction.",1,0

When comparing baseline measurements with measurements taken at 4 weeks, DBP was significant around 6.8 +/- 7.4 (mean +/- standard deviation) mmHg and 12.0 +/- 7.1 mmHg in the Doxazosin or enalapril group reduced. Systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced in both groups from baseline to the end of treatment. There were no significant changes in heart rate from baseline to the end of treatment in the doxazosin group, but there was a statistically significant decrease in heart rate in the enalapril group. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased statistically significantly in the doxazosin group but not in the enalapril group. A decrease in triglycerides was statistically significant in relation to the doxazosin group and almost significant in the enalapril group. Forty-nine (62%) patients in the doxazosin group and 43 (54%) patients in the enalapril group reported at least one adverse event. Significant reductions in DBP after 4 weeks of treatment were achieved with both drugs, each taken once daily. This reduction was more pronounced in the enalapril group 24 hours after dosing, with a mean final daily dose of 2.8 mg doxazosin and 12.6 mg enalapril.

These effects may be mediated, at least in part, by the suppression of lethal ventricular tachycardia (VT). The objectives of this study were to investigate whether the ACE inhibitor cilazapril reduces ventricular arrhythmia in patients with congestive heart failure and, if cilazapril reduces ventricular arrhythmia, to determine whether this reduction is associated with suppression of sympathetic nerve activity in these patients. Thirty-two patients with congestive heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction 35 +/- 6%; New York Heart Association class II or III) with VTs (low grade IVa or IVb) were randomized to conventional therapy consisting of diuretics and digitalis (control group) or conventional therapy plus cilazapril (cilazapril group). At baseline and after 2 months of therapy, 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring was performed. Plasma norepinephrine levels and heart rate variability (standard deviation around the mean RR interval) were compared at baseline and after 2 months of treatment. The control group showed no significant change in arrhythmia frequency after 2 months of treatment. However, in the cilazapril group, the number of ventricular couplets and VT runs was significantly reduced. Associated with this reduction was a decrease in plasma norepinephrine levels and an increase in heart rate variability. These results suggest that cilazapril has antiarrhythmic effects in patients with congestive heart failure, which may be mediated by suppression of high levels of sympathetic activity. It should be noted that the study group was small and that although ventricular arrhythmia was reduced by therapy, it remained significant. Further studies are needed to verify these results and to determine the exact causes of the reduction.",0,0

We have recently reported severe sodium retention and renal vasoconstriction during pathophysiological increases in plasma ET-1. Apart from this vasoconstrictor effect, ET-1 also has mitogenic properties that play a role in the pathophysiology of hypertension. On the other hand, some data refute an important role of ET-1 in hypertension. We therefore examined the constrictor effects of ET-1 in nine subjects with essential hypertension by injecting these subjects with a systemic infusion of ET-1 (0.5 ng/kg per minute for 60 minutes, then 1.0 ng/kg per minute for 60 minutes, and finally 2.0 ng/kg per minute for 60 minutes). In addition, we investigated whether these effects of ET-1 could be modulated by oral use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg twice daily) or the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (60 mg once daily). ET-1 infusion increased plasma ET-1 levels from 2.5 +/- 0.4 to 11.6 +/- 1.0 pmol/L (p<0.05). Blood pressure increased by approximately 10 mm Hg (P<0.05). Cardiac index decreased by 21 +/- 22% while calculated systemic vascular resistance increased by 27 +/- 6% (P < 0.05). Renal blood flow decreased from 1051 +/- 94 to 707 +/- 60 mL/min at the end of ET-1 infusion (P < 0.05) and calculated renal vascular resistance increased from 118 +/- 19 to 189+/ -19mmHg x min/L (p<0.05). Sodium excretion decreased from 227+/-39 to 111+/-15 micromol/min (p<0.05). Both enalapril and nifedipine treatment prevented the systemic effects of ET-1 infusion in these subjects. However, during treatment with enalapril, despite renal predilation, ET-1 reduced renal blood flow (from 1119 +/- 132 to 701 +/- 75 mL/min, P < 0.05) and increased renal vascular resistance (from 111 +/- 16 to 187 +/- 28 mm Hg x min/L, P<0.05) to the same values as during ET-1 infusion alone. Pretreatment with nifedipine attenuated the ET-1-induced fall in renal blood flow (from 1088 +/- 93 to 907 +/- 68 mL/min) and increase in renal vascular resistance (from 105 +/- 9 to 133 +/- 10) from mmHg x min/l). Although neither drug modulated the antinatriuretic effect of ET-1, nifedipine increased basal sodium excretion (P<0.05), which compensated for the decrease during ET-1 infusion. In conclusion, patients with essential hypertension are sensitive to the vasoconstrictor effects of ET-1. Both enalapril and nifedipine can prevent the systemic effects of ET-1, but nifedipine appears to be more effective in attenuating the renal constrictor effects of ET-1.",0,0

Therefore, we compared the efficacy and safety of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide in a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind study in 232 obese patients with hypertension. Patients with office diastolic pressure between 90 and 109 mm Hg were randomized to receive daily doses of lisinopril (10, 20, or 40 mg), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5, 25, or 50 mg), or placebo. Mean body mass indices were similar in all patients. At week 12, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide effectively reduced diastolic (-8.3 and -7.7 versus -3.3 mm Hg; p<0.005) and systolic (-9.2 and -10.0 versus -4.6 mm Hg; p < 0.05) value ) pressure compared to placebo. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring confirmed that lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide were effective in reducing 24-hour blood pressure compared to placebo (p<0.001). Significant dose-response differences were observed between treatments. Sixty percent of lisinopril-treated patients had office diastolic pressure < 90 mmHg compared to 43% of hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients (p<0.05). Response to therapies varied with both race and age. None of the treatments significantly affected insulin or lipid profiles; however, plasma glucose increased significantly after 12 weeks of hydrochlorothiazide therapy compared to lisinopril (+0.31 versus -0.21 mmol/L; P<0.001). Hydrochlorothiazide also reduced serum potassium by 0.4 mmol/L from baseline. In summary, lisinopril was as effective as hydrochlorothiazide in treating obese patients with high blood pressure. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors as monotherapy at lower doses compared to thiazide diuretics may be more effective, respond more quickly, and offer benefits in patients at high risk of metabolic disorders.",0,0

In addition, treated hypertensive patients still have a higher cardiovascular complication rate compared to matched normotensive drugs. This is particularly evident in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), an important independent risk indicator for cardiovascular disease. In addition to increasing blood pressure, angiotensin II (A-II) exerts an important influence on cardiac structure and function by stimulating cell proliferation and growth. Therefore, in order to further reduce morbidity and mortality in the treatment of hypertensive patients, it may be important to effectively block the effects of A-II. Losartan, the first of a new class of antihypertensive drugs, can achieve this directly at the A-II receptor level. It therefore seems appropriate to investigate whether selective A-II receptor blockade with losartan not only lowers blood pressure but also lowers LVH more effectively than current therapy and thus improves prognosis. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction (LIFE) in Hypertension study is a double-blind, prospective, parallel-group study designed to compare the effects of losartan versus the beta-blocker atenolol on reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in approximately 8,300 hypertensive patients (initial seated diastolic blood pressure 95 to 115 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure 160 to 200 mm Hg) with electrocardiographically documented LVH. The study, which will last at least 4 years and will have 1,040 patients to experience a primary endpoint, was designed with a statistical power that will detect a difference of at least 15% between groups in the incidence of composite cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is also the first prospective study of sufficient power to associate reversal of LVH with reduction in major cardiovascular events. The rationale of the study, which will involve more than 800 clinical centers in Scandinavia, Great Britain and the United States, is discussed and the main features of its design and general organization are described.

In addition to the blood pressure lowering effects of combinations of both drugs compared to monotherapy, all given once a day, the effect on quality of life was also assessed. This study consisted of a 3 x 2 multifactorial design in which 156 women and men with a seated diastolic pressure between 95 mm Hg and 114 mm Hg after a 4-week placebo washout period were randomized to one of six 12-person treatment groups weeks of active treatment. Monotherapy with diltiazem 120 or 240 mg resulted in progressive reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Compared to placebo, lisinopril 10 mg had an effect intermediate between diltiazem doses. The combinations of diltiazem 240 mg + lisinopril 10 mg and diltiazem 120 mg + lisinopril 10 mg showed increased efficacy in lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to these drug doses used in monotherapy, but the effect of the combinations was less than predicted by an additive model. Although the total number of other adverse events reported was similar for all active treatment groups compared to placebo, lisinopril-induced cough was common with a 31% incidence after re-challenge. In four of 78 patients receiving lisinopril, a persistent cough required early drug discontinuation. The combination of diltiazem 240 mg and lisinopril 10 mg was significantly more effective at lowering blood pressure than either drug alone; this additive effect did not result in a higher rate of side effects or impairment of quality of life. Therefore, combination therapy with these agents was well tolerated and resulted in increased efficacy in these elderly patients.",0,0

However, whether this is due to the inhibition of angiotensin (Ang) II production or to reduced bradykinin breakdown is unknown.; In eight normotensive patients with angiographic evidence of mild left coronary artery lesions (< or = 50%), mean arterial pressure (MAP, intra-arterial catheter), heart rate (HF, ECG lead), coronary sinus perfusion (CBF, thermodilution method) and coronary vascular resistance (CVR, ratio between MAP and CBF) was measured before and during a 15-minute intracoronary infusion of Ang II from the left at a dose that had no direct coronary or systemic vasomotor effects. The same measurements were taken before and during a 15-minute saline infusion. At the end of each infusion period, a 2-minute cold press test (CPT) and a 45-second dunk were performed. These maneuvers were used because their coronary vasomotor effects are abolished by phentolamine and thus depend on sympathetic activation. During saline infusion, both CPT and diving caused a marked increase in MAP. Heart rate increased with CPT and fell with diving. CBF increased in parallel with MAP increase, with little change in CVR. MAP and HR responses were similar during Ang II infusion, but caused either no change or a decrease in CBF with a consequent marked increase in CVR in both CPT and diving. In four other patients, stenotic vessel diameter remained unchanged during CPT performed with saline and Ang II infusion; Ang II markedly enhances sympathetic influences on the coronary circulation in humans, presumably acting at the arteriolar level.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the sites and extent of in vivo inhibition of ACE by long-term treatment with perindopril in different layers of the internal mammary artery in patients with ischemic heart disease.; Sixteen patients with ischemic heart disease were treated either with perindopril (4 mg/d po) for up to 36 days before surgery (n=9) or without the inhibitor as controls (n=7). Internal mammary artery segments were collected for measurement of vascular-free and total ACE by quantitative in vitro autoradiography with 125I-351A binding. Patients treated with perindopril had lower plasma ACE (P<0.001) and plasma angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang I ratio (P<0.05). In the internal mammary artery, free ACE was similarly inhibited by perindopril in the endothelium (p<0.05) and in the adventitia (p<0.05), and the ratio of free ACE to total ACE, an index of ACE inhibition was significantly reduced by perindopril in parallel in the endothelium (P<0.001) and adventitia (P<0.001). Furthermore, plasma ACE was strongly correlated with vascular ACE in the endothelium (r=0.85, p<0.001) or adventitia (r=0.78, p<0.001), and mean arterial pressure was significantly correlated with free ACE in the endothelium (r = 0.52, P < 0.05) or adventitia (r = 0.53, P < 0.05) and with the plasma Ang II to Ang I ratio (r = 0.53, P < 0 ,05). Light microscopic autoradiographs of 125I-351A binding showed marked inhibition of ACE by perindopril in both layers of the vessel wall.; The present invention shows that long-term administration of perindopril effectively inhibits both endothelial and adventitial ACE to a comparable extent in the human internal mammary artery. These results indicate that perindopril penetrates the vessel wall effectively to inhibit ACE in the adventitia, providing evidence that perindopril may be beneficial in inhibiting both circulating Ang II and its local formation in the vessel wall.",0,0

Biochemical, hormonal (ACE, Ang I, Ang II), isotopic renal function (GFR, ERPF, ECFV), pretreatment diuretic dose, and baseline heart failure scores were similar between groups. Concomitant cardiac treatments were unchanged and withdrawal of diuretics was not used to initiate treatment.; There were no significant effects on electrolytes, liver function tests, serum, or RBC magnesium.

Active treatment was associated with significant ACE inhibition (P, baseline 47 +/- 17 to 43 +/- 17; Per baseline 49 +/- 15 to 14 +/- 7); aldosterone (P, baseline 337 +/- 179 to 375 +/- 306; Per, baseline 335 +/- 357 to 293 +/- 155 pg ml(-1)) and Ang II suppression (P, baseline 9+ /- 9 to 20 +/- 39; per baseline 10 +/- 9 to 3 +/- 3 o'clock). Isotopic renal function was not affected by either treatment.; At this dose (2-4 mg orally), long-term therapy with perindopril has no significant effect on blood pressure or renal function. Persistent neurohormonal suppression of ACE and AII occurred with no evidence of AII reactivation. A lack of an effect on blood pressure at these doses may make perindopril suitable for studies in unstable patients with acute heart failure or in patients concerned about ACEI-induced hypotension.",0,0

Left ventricular hypertrophy and abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism are both possible factors contributing to the high risk of cardiovascular death in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis. We examined the effects of simvastatin on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and the effects of enalapril on left ventricular mass in 107 patients receiving hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Patients were randomized in a factorial design to receive either simvastatin (10 mg daily) or placebo and enalapril (2.5-5 mg daily) or placebo. During follow-up, there was a significant excess of patients who discontinued enalapril for hypotension (2p=0.002), and at 6 months only 55% of patients who were assigned enalapril remained on treatment. From baseline to 6 months, there were no statistically significant differences in left ventricular mass or left ventricular dimensions between patients administered enalapril and patients administered placebo. In patients treated with simvastatin, total cholesterol was reduced by 13% (2 p=0.001), LDL cholesterol by 17% (2 p=0.003) and apolipoprotein B by 12% (2 p=0.005) compared to those with placebo-treated patients. There were borderline significant (2p=0.05 to 0.08) reductions in VLDL cholesterol, total triglycerides, and VLDL triglycerides of 26%, 12%, and 17%, respectively.

The mechanisms responsible for reducing ischemic events are unknown, but likely candidates include effects on the atherosclerotic process, thrombosis, and/or vascular tone.; The effects of ACE inhibitor therapy with ramipril on plasma fibrinolytic variables were evaluated in 120 subjects participating in the HEART (Healing and Early Afterload Reduction Therapy) study, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction who were... randomized 24 hours after symptom onset to receive low dose ramipril (0.625 mg daily), full dose ramipril (1.25 mg titrated to 10 mg/d), or placebo for 14 days. Plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity and PAI-1 antigen and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) antigen were measured before randomization and on day 14. The clinical characteristics of the three study groups were similar, as were the pre-randomization plasma levels of PAI-1 antigen, PAI-1 activity and TPA antigen. Compared to the placebo group, at day 14, PAI-1 antigen levels were 44% lower (p=0.004) and PAI-1 activity levels were 22% lower (p=0.02) in ramipril-treated patients. In contrast, plasma TPA levels were not significantly different between the placebo and ramipril treated groups.

Meta-analyses suggest a 12 percent reduction in all-cause mortality, a 20 percent reduction in coronary artery disease, and a 36 percent reduction in stroke. The absolute benefits of treatment are great due to the high incidence of vascular disease in the elderly. However, concerns about adverse effects on cognition, mood, functioning, and quality of life may have deterred physicians from initiating treatment. Recent evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests these concerns are unfounded. It is therefore worrying, given these findings, that up to 50% of all elderly people with hypertension may remain untreated; and blood pressure is inadequately controlled in over 50% of treated patients.",0,0

Left ventriculograms were analyzed for diastolic and systolic volumes, global left ventricular sphericity, extent of wall motion abnormality, and endocardial curvature. The presence of MI was associated with the risk of developing a cardiovascular event during the 3.5 year follow-up. MR was present in 141 patients (19.4%). Severe (3+) MR was present in only 2 patients. Patients with MR were more likely to have a persistently occluded infarct artery (MR versus no MR, 27.3% versus 15.2%; p=0.001). Although ejection fractions were similar, MR patients had larger end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes and more spherical ventricles than non-MR patients.

In both groups, blood pressure and heart rate were not different during flow measurements before and after therapy. Before treatment, mean MBF at rest, during pacing tachycardia, and after dipyridamole infusion were similar in both groups; however, pacemaker and dipyridamole fluxes were significantly lower than those obtained in a control group of subjects with normal blood pressure. After treatment, MBF did not change in the enalapril-treated patients in the three study conditions. In verapamil-treated patients, MBF did not change at rest and increased significantly during stimulation and after dipyridamole. The inhomogeneity of the regional MBF distribution, assessed by the coefficient of variation, decreased at rest after both treatments and in the enalapril group also during stimulation. No association was found between changes in MBF and changes in left ventricular mass.; In arterial hypertension, MBF is impaired during pacing tachycardia and after dipyridamole. Successful therapy with verapamil increases the MBF response to these stimuli, independent of changes in perfusion pressure and left ventricular mass. These results suggest that verapamil directly improves coronary microcirculatory function in hypertension.

We studied patients enrolled in the left ventricular dysfunction studies and assessed the exercise heart rate (HR) and plasma norepinephrine (PNE) responses. 87 patients were screened prior to randomization; 65 of these were evaluated 1 year after randomization to placebo or enalapril. Compared to patients in the prevention study (asymptomatic), patients in the treatment study (symptomatic) had higher resting HR and PNE values and a smaller increase in heart rate with a greater increase in PNE during exercise. Acute administration of enalapril increased resting heart rate only in patients in the prevention study, but had no significant effect on PNE. After 1 year of therapy, the patients in the prevention study showed no change. Within the treatment study, the placebo group showed both a higher peak PNE and an increase in exercise PNE than the enalapril group, whose HR response was maintained despite a decrease in exercise PNE. We conclude that (1) symptomatic patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction have greater adrenergic activity at rest and during exercise with blunted HR response compared to asymptomatic patients; and (2) in symptomatic patients, 1-year treatment with enalapril resulted in an enhanced HR response to adrenergic stimulation, supporting an interaction between renin/angiotensin and the adrenergic nervous system.

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the only drugs reasonably accepted to improve prognosis in such patients. Accordingly, in nine patients (four women and five men aged 73.6 +/- 6 years) with heart failure (NYHA classes II-III) and in sinus rhythm, we determined the PSNA by heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. HRV was determined during 20-40 minutes of supine rest at baseline and then at 2-week intervals during incremental dosing of oral captopril, 12.5 mg bid, 25 mg bid, and 50 mg bid. Poincaré plot and traditional time and frequency domain measurements were used to analyze the data. Low-dose captopril (12.5 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase in SD delta RR (16.0 +/- 6.6 to 22.0 +/- 9.1 ms; p < 0.05). We have previously validated this as a measure of PSNA. A higher dose of captopril (25 mg twice daily) also resulted in an increase in PSNA activity (16.0 +/- 6.6 to 18.7 +/- 7.8 ms), although this did not reach statistical significance. However, the highest dose of captopril (50 mg twice daily) reduced PSNA activity to levels close to baseline, as demonstrated by measurements of HRV in both the time and frequency domains. These data suggest that only a low dose of captopril increases PSNA in heart failure patients. The dosing of ACE inhibitors can be important to optimize their benefit in CHF.",0,0

The urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) was determined centrally by two nightly urine collections at baseline, after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months; There was no difference in baseline characteristics by treatment group; the mean AER was 8.0 micrograms/min in both groups; and the prevalence of microalbuminuria was 13% and 17% in the placebo and lisinopril groups, respectively. In the intention-to-treat analysis at 2 years, the AER in the lisinopril group was 2.2 micrograms/min lower than in the placebo group, a percentage difference of 18.8% (95% CI 2.0-32 .7, p=0.03), adjusted for AER at baseline and midpoint, absolute difference 2.2 micrograms/min. In people with normoalbuminuria, the treatment difference was 1.0 micrograms/min (12.7% [-2.9 to 26.0], p=0.1). However, in patients with microalbuminuria, the treatment difference was 34.2 micrograms/min (49.7% [-14.5 to 77.9], p=0.1; for interaction, p=0.04). In patients who completed the 24-month study, the final treatment difference in AER was 38.5 micrograms/min in patients with microalbuminuria at baseline (p=0.001) and 0.23 micrograms/min in patients with normoalbuminuria at baseline ( p=0.6). There was no treatment difference in hypoglycaemic events or in metabolic control as measured by glycated hemoglobin.; Lisinopril slows kidney disease progression in normotensive IDDM patients with little or no albuminuria, although the greatest effect was seen in patients with microalbuminuria (AER > or = 20 micrograms/min). Our results show that lisinopril does not increase the risk of hypoglycaemic events in IDDM.",0,0

2207,9282581,Effect of enalapril on renal profile and right ventricular dimensions in chronic cor pulmonale.,,"Mahajan, S K; Sharma, V K; Thakral, S","The effect of enalapril in combination with bronchodilators, diuretics, antibiotics and/or steroids was compared with that of conventional treatment with diuretics, steroids and antibiotics alone in 30 patients with chronic cor pulmonale. The effect was examined after a treatment period of 6 weeks on the dimensions of the right ventricle and the renal profile. The control patients showed a significant decrease in RVIDED and an increase in GFR, but the decrease in RVAWT and increase in 'a' wave amplitude was insignificant. However, when the ACE inhibitor enalapril was added to treatment, there was a significant decrease in RVIDED, RVAWT and an increase in ""a"" wave amplitude with a significant improvement in GFR. A comparison between both groups showed that the increase in GFR and the decrease in RVIDED was higher in the enalapril group than in the control group. The increase in A-wave amplitude was also greater in the enalapril group. Therefore, enalapril appears to be of benefit in chronic cor-pulmonale, where it reduces pulmonary hypertension and thus the right ventricle after exercise. It also reduces renal vascular resistance, which increases renal blood flow, which improves GFR.",0,0

2210,9284842,Calcium channel blockers: an evidence-based review.,,"Waters, D","Calcium channel blockers are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, but their actual therapeutic role is controversial. Nonetheless, drugs of this class have been evaluated in many controlled clinical trials of appropriate size and duration in different patient populations. Although many important questions remain unanswered, these studies have clarified when and how these drugs should be used. In general, the benefits of calcium channel blockers in controlling angina and hypertension are much better documented than their long-term effects on harder endpoints such as mortality. Such long-term data is urgently needed, especially for hypertension. An increased risk with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers has been clearly observed in several studies in patients with coronary artery disease. In coronary patients with heart failure, the harmful effects of nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil outweigh any possible benefits. Long-acting formulations and newer calcium channel blockers may not have all of the side effects of older drugs in this class; However, their long-term safety has not yet been documented. An understanding of the limitations of calcium channel blockers based on clinical trial results often leads the physician to select a drug from a different class where efficacy has been clearly demonstrated.",0,0

When possible, the dose of study drug was increased gradually to 4 mg trandolapril or an equivalent amount of placebo during the first month after randomization. Blood samples for determination of fibrinolytic system variables, ACE activity, and ACE genotype were collected prior to randomization and during outpatient visits at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. After the subject fasted overnight, blood samples were collected in the morning (08:00-10:00) after the subject had been in a supine position for at least 15 min from a vein cannula inserted into the forearm. The effect of trandolapril on the fibrinolytic variables was assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC1-12) from month 1 to month 12; The trandolapril and placebo groups were similar with respect to baseline clinical characteristics, baseline fibrinolytic variables, and baseline plasma ACE activity. The trandolapril group was not significantly different from the placebo group for AUC1-12 t-PA antigen [11.67 (3.95-26.45) versus 10.34 ng/mL (3.71-19 .62), P=0.19] and AUC1-12 plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) antigen [27.57 (8.38-89.49) versus 24.40 ng/mL ( 7.94-90.62), P=0.92].

Fatal and nonfatal stroke combined was the primary endpoint.; All patients (> 60 years) were initially started on masked placebo. At three visits 1 month apart, their mean sitting systolic blood pressure was 160-219 mm Hg with diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mm Hg. After stratification by center, sex, and prior cardiovascular complications, 4,695 patients were randomized to nitrendipine 10-40 mg daily with the possible addition of enalapril 5-20 mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-25.0 mg daily or matching placebos. Patients who discontinued double-blind treatment continued to be followed.

There is no evidence of these potential effects in healthy humans.; We report the results of 31 patients with stable chronic heart failure (CHF) who were treated with spironolactone (50-100 mg/day) or placebo in addition to diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In a controlled, randomized, double-blind study, we found that treatment with spironolactone reduced circulating levels of the N-terminal aminopeptide procollagen type III, a marker of vascular collagen turnover, and additionally increased time-domain parameters of heart rate variability (n=24). These latter parameters suggest a parasympathomimetic effect for supplemental spironolactone. Spironolactone significantly reduced heart rate (prolonged RR interval), especially during the morning hours (06:00-09:00). In this unbalanced study, it was not possible to provide a detailed daily assessment of the effects of spironolactone on heart rate variability, but the preliminary data suggest that there may be a time-varying interaction with the autonomic nervous system.; These are the first human data showing that use of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone can positively improve time-domain heart rate variability and reduce myocardial collagen turnover, reflected in further reductions in serum procollagen peptide, despite concomitant treatment with ACE- inhibitors. Residual aldosterone after ACE inhibitor treatment may therefore play a role in promoting arrhythmia and cardiac death through two mechanisms. The effects of supplemental spironolactone on heart rate slowing (and possibly the deleterious effect of aldosterone) were most evident between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., when cardiac death is also known to be most pronounced.",0,0

Patients who have undergone the Fontan procedure have decreased cardiac output, increased systemic vascular resistance, abnormal diastolic function, and decreased exercise capacity compared to healthy people.; To test the hypothesis that afterload reduction therapy alters hemodynamic variables and increases exercise capacity in patients after Fontan surgery, we compared the results of graded exercise to maximal exertion in 18 subjects (14.5 +/- 6.2 years old, 4 to 19 years after Fontan procedure) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of enalapril (0.2 to 0.3 mg x kg[-1] xd[-1], maximum 15 mg). Each treatment was administered for 10 weeks. Resting diastolic filling patterns were assessed by Doppler determination of systemic atrioventricular valve flow velocity at the end of each therapy. No difference was seen in resting heart rate, blood pressure, or cardiac index. Diastolic filling patterns were also similar. The duration of exercise was not different (6.4 +/- 2.6 [enalapril] versus 6.7 +/- 2.6 minutes [placebo]).

When DBP-leading treatment was above (>89 mm Hg), at (80-89 mm Hg), or below (<80 mm Hg) target, 1 physician blinded to patient randomization administered intensified antihypertensive therapy treatment by, or left unchanged reduced, respectively; The CBP and ABP values, intensity of drug treatment, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic left ventricular mass, symptoms reported by questionnaire and costs.; At the end of the study (median follow-up 182 days; 5th to 95th percentile range 85-258 days), more ABP than CBP patients had discontinued antihypertensive medication (26.3% vs 7.3%; p<0.001) . and fewer ABP patients had progressed to ongoing multidrug treatment (27.2% vs. 42.7%; p<0.001). Final CBP and 24-hour ABP averaged 144.1/89.9 mm Hg and 129.4/79.5 mm Hg in the ABP group, and 140.3/89.6 mm Hg and 128.0/ 79.1 mm Hg in the CBP group. Left ventricle mass and reported symptoms were similar in both groups. The potential savings in the ABP group in terms of less intensive drug treatment and fewer doctor visits were offset by the cost of ABP monitoring.; Adjusting antihypertensive treatment based on ABP monitoring instead of CBP measurement resulted in less intensive drug treatment with preservation of blood pressure control, general well-being, and inhibition of left ventricular dilation, but did not reduce the overall cost of antihypertensive treatment.",0,0

Although specific receptor blockade with losartan has certain theoretical advantages over non-specific ACE inhibition, definitive evidence of comparable effects in patients with congestive heart failure is lacking.; A double-blind, multicentre, randomized, parallel, enalapril-controlled study was conducted in 116 patients with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classes II to IV) and left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 45%, previously treated with stable doses of ACE - Inhibitors and diuretics, with or without concomitant digitalis and other vasodilators.

Drug efficacy was assessed by changes in maximum treadmill exercise time (using a modified Naughton protocol), 6-minute walk test, left ventricular ejection fraction, and dyspnea fatigue index. Safety was measured by the occurrence of adverse clinical and laboratory experiences.; Treadmill exercise time and the 6-minute walk test did not change significantly after replacing ACE inhibitor therapy with losartan. Similarly, no significant change was observed in either the dyspnea fatigue index or left ventricular ejection fraction at the end of the double-blind period compared to baseline.; Losartan was generally well tolerated and comparable to enalapril in terms of exercise tolerance in this short-term (12-week) study in heart failure patients.

Blood pressure (BP) was determined at 10-minute intervals for 6 hours after administration. At 6 h, the BP drops induced by these drugs were still significantly lower than baseline placebo values. The blood pressure-lowering effect of nifedipine capsules set in more quickly in both white and black patients than that of captopril and in black patients of nifedipine-retard. Taking into account the area under the curve of blood pressure values during the 6-hour treatment, the overall antihypertensive effect of nifedipine capsules in white patients was similar to that of captopril, but significantly more pronounced than captopril and nifedipine prolonged-release in black patients. In white patients, similar maximum blood pressure reductions (mean +/- standard deviation) were achieved with nifedipine capsules (71+/-4/52+/-4 mm Hg) and with captopril (69+/-4/50+/-3). mmHg). In black patients, the maximum drop in blood pressure from nifedipine capsules (70+/-4/52+/-4 mm Hg) was greater (P<0.02) than that from captopril (48+/-4/32+/ -3 mmHg), but similar to nifedipine-retard (71+/-4/49+/-4 mmHg). However, in contrast to nifedipine capsules and captopril, nifedipine-retard led to a slower drop in blood pressure. The time of peak blood pressure drop occurred within the first 2 hours for both nifedipine capsules and captopril, while it occurred only between 4 and 6 hours after administration for nifedipine prolonged-release. Fewer patients reported side effects with nifedipine-retard compared to the other two preparations. We conclude that single doses of captopril and nifedipine lower blood pressure for at least 6 hours in both white and black patients with hypertensive crisis, but nifedipine is more effective than captopril in black patients. The slow-release form of nifedipine-retard effectively and safely lowers blood pressure while providing a sufficiently rapid effect without experiencing the critical rapid drop in blood pressure seen with nifedipine capsules.",0,0

At baseline and subsequently at the end of the third, sixth and twelfth months, each patient underwent an integrated echocardiographic examination and non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Both drugs significantly reduced blood pressure, occasional or monitored (p < 0.01), and left ventricular mass index (from 125 +/- 32 to 100 +/- 12 g/m2 [p < 0.02] with amlodipine and from 106 +/- 18 to 89 +/- 10 g/m2 [p<0.02] with fosinopril). The decrease in left ventricular mass was mainly caused by a reduction in ventricular thickness. Wall thickness of the free right ventricle was also reduced in both groups, more consistently with amlodipine (from 8.0 +/- 2.1 to 6.4 +/- 0.8 mm; p<0.01), with no increase in plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptide and insulin or heart rate. With either treatment, the decrease in ventricular mass was not associated with impairment in systolic function, while a trend toward improvement in Doppler echocardiographic indices of biventricular diastolic function was observed. In conclusion, both amlodipine and fosinopril induced similar qualitative effects on the anatomy and function of both ventricles. The clinical significance of these observations needs to be further defined by sufficiently large prospective studies.",0,0

Elevated insulin/glucose ratios (IGR) were found in half of our patients, indicating insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinemic and normoinsulinemic obese hypertensive patients had comparable fasting glucose and DHEA-S concentrations and blood pressure (BP) values. Thus, no relationships were found between fasting insulin and DHEA-S levels. Fasting hyperinsulinemia was found in only half of obese hypertensive patients, suggesting that not all obese hypertensive patients share the same high cardiovascular risk. Short-term treatment with captopril, prazosin, verapamil, atenolol, or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) lowered blood pressure; A greater reduction in blood pressure has been observed with medicinal products with a vasodilating effect. Captopril, prazosin, and verapamil reduced fasting insulin levels, while atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide did not. The former drugs lowered fasting insulin levels that were either within normal limits or in the hyperinsulinemic range. None of the drug treatments resulted in significant increases in serum DHEA-S concentration, although some of them significantly reduced fasting insulin levels. Relationships between insulin and DHEA-S levels were not observed either at baseline or at the end of antihypertensive treatment. The reduction in blood pressure resulting from peripheral vasodilation may explain the insulin-lowering effect of captopril, verapamil and prazosin.

However, it decreased from 27.9 +/- 1.8 to 25.3 +/- 1.9% in group I (n = 31, p < 0.001) and from 35.9 +/- 3.5 to 32, 2 +/- 3.9% in Group III (n=35). , p<0.001). Cr doubled in 26 patients (84%) in group I compared to 22 (52%) in group II and 21 (60%) in group III. The cumulative renal survival rates in groups II and III were significantly better than in group I: p=0.0003 (group I vs. group II) and p=0.0024 (group I vs. group III). However, there was no difference in renal survival between groups II and III (p=0.3111). The better survival rate achieved in Group II was attributable to the better survival rate for the non-diabetic patients in this group. The present study suggests that anemia per se is a factor in the progression of end-stage renal failure and that reversal of anemia by EPO may delay the progression of renal failure, particularly in nondiabetic patients, provided that blood pressure control, rate of an increase in Ht and dietary protein restriction are appropriate.",0,0

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and calcium antagonists.",,"Gifford, R W","ACEIs, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and calcium channel blockers are effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive drugs but, except in special situations, should be considered as alternative first-line drugs until randomized trials show they are at least as effective such as diuretics and beta drugs. Blockers to prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a broad spectrum of hypertensive patients. ACEIs are particularly indicated for the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and patients with diabetic nephropathy, especially type I diabetes. In theory, the AII receptor antagonists are equally effective for these indications and randomized trials are currently underway to demonstrate this. Specific indications for calcium channel blockers in the treatment of hypertension are angina pectoris and for non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with fast ventricular rate. Isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly is a specific indication for long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, although diuretics are preferred. Calcium antagonists have been particularly effective in the treatment of cyclosporine-induced hypertension. They are contraindicated in CHF due to systolic dysfunction and in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. The long-term cardioprotective effect of calcium channel blockers after myocardial infarction has only been demonstrated for verapamil and diltiazem in patients with no evidence of LV dysfunction during their infarction. Calcium antagonists should only be prescribed for this purpose when beta-blockers are poorly tolerated or contraindicated.",0,0

A total of 127 adult outpatients with diastolic blood pressure between 100 and 114 mmHg were randomized into this double-blind, parallel-group study. After a 2-week wash-out period and a subsequent 2-week placebo run-in period, they were assigned to once-daily treatment with reserpine 0.1 mg plus clopamide (R/C) 5 mg or enalapril 5 mg. If diastolic blood pressure had not normalized (ie, DBP < 90 mmHg) after 3 weeks of therapy, dosing was doubled from weeks 4 to 6. The primary efficacy variable was the change in mean seated diastolic and systolic blood pressure (DBP/SBP) after 3 weeks of therapy. Secondary variables were the change in DBP and SBP after 6 weeks of therapy, the BP normalization rates after 3 and 6 weeks, and for tolerability, the rates of adverse events after 6 weeks of therapy. An intent-to-treat analysis was performed. The reserpine/clopamide and enalapril groups did not differ with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics (mean age 57 and 58 years, respectively; 63% and 56% males, respectively; mean SBP/DBP after the 2-week placebo period = 156 mmHg /104 mmHg in both groups). After 3 weeks of treatment with one capsule daily, the mean SBP/DBP reduction from baseline (24 h after last drug dose) was -19.6/-17.0 mmHg in the R/C combination group, in the enalapril- Group -6.1/ -9.5 mmHg (intergroup comparison: 2p < 0.01 for both parameters). The normalization rates for DBP (<90 mmHg) were 64.1% (R/C) and 28.6% (enalapril) (2p<0.01). Adverse reactions considered by the investigator to be possibly or definitely drug-related were identified in 11 patients (17.2%) in the R/C group and 9 patients (14.3%) in the enalapril (NS) group. Two patients in the enalapril group discontinued the study prematurely due to side effects (cough, skin rash). In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, a low-dose combination of reserpine and clopamide once daily is significantly more effective and as well tolerated as enalapril 5-10 mg once daily. These results suggest that treatment with a combination of different antihypertensive drugs with different mechanisms of action at low doses is a reasonable alternative to conventional monotherapy in the first-line treatment of hypertension. In addition, the ""old"" reserpine diuretic therapy still appears to be a sensible alternative to ""modern"" monotherapies.",0,0

The specific aim of this study was to investigate whether short-term administration of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in hypertensive patients with altered diastolic pattern produced an improvement in left ventricular dynamics, assessed by the echocardio-Doppler technique, independently of effects on left ventricular mass. In a double-blind, cross-over study, 39 patients with essential hypertension with a maximum early to maximum atrial velocity (E/A) ratio < 1 after a run-in period of 2 weeks without any antihypertensive treatment were randomized to receive lisinopril (20 mg once daily) or placebo for 4 weeks. At the end of both the run-in and treatment periods, blood pressure and heart rate were measured and an echocardio-Doppler examination was performed. Echocardio-Doppler evaluation was performed both at rest and at the peak of a hand grip test (3 min at 30% of maximum strength). Left ventricle dimensions were obtained from two-dimensional guided M-mode recordings using American Society of Echocardiography criteria. Left ventricular peak filling rates and filling rate integrals were measured by a pulsed Doppler technique. Lisinopril caused significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest (-13/-9 mmHg vs baseline, p<0.05; -6/-4 mmHg vs placebo, p<0.05) and during isometric Load (-17/-9 mmHg vs. baseline, p<0.05; -6/-5 mmHg vs. placebo, p<0.05). Lisinopril did not induce any significant change in left ventricular structure and systolic function. All considered left ventricular filling parameters (E velocity, A velocity, E/A ratio) both at rest and during isometric exercise were not significantly different after treatment with lisinopril compared to those obtained under baseline conditions and after placebo administration became. This double-blind, crossover study demonstrates that a lisinopril-induced short-term reduction in afterload does not alter the altered diastolic dynamics in hypertensive patients. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is a complex process influenced by a number of functional and structural factors and apparently cannot be significantly ameliorated by short-term blood pressure reduction by antihypertensive therapy.",0,0

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be able to reverse LVH through mechanisms independent of their antihypertensive effects. In this study, 18 subjects without arterial hypertension or severe anemia were selected from 170 chronically hemodialyzed uremic patients after meeting the criterion of a supranormal left ventricular mass (LVM). Ten subjects agreed to undergo treatment with 2.5 to 20 mg lisinopril every other day for a period of 2 years, during which annual determinations of LVM by echocardiography and 24-hour blood pressure were made with a portable device . Eight patients who refused to undergo treatment served as controls. The mean resting left ventricular mass index (LVMi) for the whole group was 178 +/- 30 g/m2 body surface area (+/- SD) and did not differ between the two subgroups. Treatment with lisinopril significantly reduced LVM in eight out of ten treated subjects and even completely normalized it in three. The LVM of the untreated group remained unchanged. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 138 +/- 5 mm Hg and 78 +/- 6 mm Hg in the treated group and 133 +/- 9 mm Hg and 75 +/- 4 mm Hg in the untreated group, respectively (P = NS ) and did not change in the following 2 years. This study indicates that a low level of LVH, which appears to be independent of arterial pressure loading, exists in a narrow subset of patients with uremia. This study also shows that this type of LVH is obviously non-progressive. ACE inhibitors given in doses that do not affect blood pressure can reverse it.",0,0

2254,9377617,Concomitant administration of tamsulosin and three antihypertensive agents in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia: pharmacodynamic effect.,,"Lowe, F C","Tamsulosin, an alpha-1A adrenoceptor antagonist, was recently approved for the treatment of patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Tamsulosin is highly selective for prostate receptors with minimal affinity for vascular receptors. Therefore, it should have little effect on blood pressure and should not potentiate the antihypertensive effects of other drugs. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to assess how co-administration of tamsulosin would affect the pharmacodynamic profiles of nifedipine, enalapril, and atenolol. Each study enrolled 12 hypertensive men aged 45 years or older whose blood pressure was controlled with maintenance doses of nifedipine (Study 1), enalapril (Study 2), or atenolol (Study 3). All 36 subjects were treated with placebo for 5 days and then randomized to receive either placebo (control group) or tamsulosin therapy (0.4 mg/day for 7 days followed by 0.8 mg/day for 7 days) in addition to assigned to continue her antihypertensive maintenance therapy. Blood pressure and pulse rate were monitored over a 24 hour period on study days 4, 11 and 19. Concomitant administration of tamsulosin in these small studies had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacodynamic effects of nifedipine, enalapril or atenolol; it did not cause clinically significant differences in pulse rate and blood pressure, did not alter electrocardiographic or Holter monitoring results, and did not cause increased side effects. Concomitant administration of tamsulosin with the three antihypertensive drugs studied had a favorable safety profile. Our results in these small studies indicate that the dose of nifedipine, enalapril, or atenolol did not need to be adjusted in patients given tamsulosin, which compares tamsulosin to other alpha-blockers used to treat patients with BPH. could give an advantage. Now that tamsulosin has been approved in the United States, further clinical use could confirm these findings.",0,0

The study design was double-blind for the first 6 months and open-label thereafter. Captopril 25-50 mg/day was added to the treatment of patients who did not respond; subsequently, patients who did not respond to the combination therapy were switched to any therapy chosen by the treating physicians (free therapy). The seated subject's blood pressure, heart rate, and a standard clinical safety profile (electrocardiogram, laboratory tests, adverse events, cardiovascular events, and deaths) were assessed periodically throughout the study.; At 2 years, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced in members of both treatment groups (by 16.3/16.6% with verapamil and by 16.9/16.2% with chlorthalidone, both by analysis of variance, P<0, 0001).

2256,9384458,Drug treatment for acute porphyria.,,"Gorchein, A","Acute hepatic porphyrias are rare pharmacogenetic disorders that are inherited as low-penetrance autosomal dominant disorders. The genetic defect is a 50% deficiency of an enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Patients may develop ""neurovisceral attacks,"" which include severe abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric manifestations, and potentially fatal respiratory paralysis. Attacks generally occur after puberty, are much more common in women, and can be triggered by endogenous hormonal changes, diet, alcohol, severe infections, and many medications. Treatment includes analgesia, early administration of heme, and general supportive measures. Patients are at greater risk of a severe seizure at initial presentation because an abdominal emergency can be simulated and inappropriate medication, including that for general anesthesia, can exacerbate the crisis. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, urine should be examined for elevated porphobilinogen, which is pathognomonic of the acute attack. The genotype of blood relatives of index cases must be determined so that carriers can avoid drugs and other precipitating agents. Some drugs have been identified as safe or unsafe through clinical use, but information about many drugs is unavailable or based only on their properties in rodents or in tissue culture systems. The importance of these substances to the human condition remains controversial, but drugs that have been shown to be porphyrinogenic in animal systems should be avoided when there is a known safe alternative. When it is important to use a drug whose safety is unknown, close biochemical and clinical observation can warn of an impending attack.",0,0

After a washout period of 4 weeks, patients received lisinopril in combination with hydrochlorothiazide once daily for 6 weeks. At the end of the washout and treatment periods, clinical blood pressure was determined 24 hours after dosing and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure was monitored, with blood pressure readings taken every 15 minutes. Clinical blood pressure before treatment was 171.3 +/- 14.0/103.7 +/- 5.1 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) in the hypertensive systodiastolic group (n = 405) and 179.6 +/- - 9.4/83.6 +/- 5.4 mm Hg in the isolated systolic hypertension group (n=165).

2259,9388037,Comparison of the effects of isradipine and enalapril on the regional carotid artery in patients with hypertension and unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis.,,"Akopov, S E; Simonian, N A","The aim of this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to demonstrate the cerebrovascular effects of isradipine and enalapril in patients with moderate hypertension as a function of the presence and degree of unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. We assessed carotid artery vascular resistance using Doppler analysis and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using the 133Xe clearance technique before and after a single oral 5 mg dose of isradipine, enalapril, or placebo. Their effects were tested randomly and consecutively in 73 patients with essential hypertension divided into three groups: without occlusive carotid lesions, with moderate (50-75%) and with severe (76-99%) unilateral asymptomatic ICA stenosis. There were no differences in age, gender, and antihypertensive effects of the drugs between these three subgroups. Three main variants of cerebrovascular drug effects were observed: absence of changes (variant I), decrease in carotid vascular resistance with increase in rCBF and elimination of lateral asymmetry (variant II), and increase in carotid vascular resistance with further decrease in rCBF in ipsilateral ICA stenosis and increased lateral asymmetry (variant III). The frequency of variant III was significantly higher in patients with severe ICA stenosis. Enalapril produced variant I cerebrovascular effects in most patients studied; Variant III was observed in only 13% of patients with severe ICA stenosis. Isradipine elicited variant I cerebrovascular effects much less frequently than enalapril. For this drug, Variant II was most typical in patients without ICA stenosis and with moderate ICA stenosis. However, isradipine reduced cerebral perfusion in 43.5% of patients with severe ICA stenosis. Presumably, the presence of an ICA stenosis, especially > 75%, increases the risk of cerebrovascular disorders during antihypertensive therapy. In patients with severe ICA stenosis, treatment with enalapril appears to be safer than isradipine.",0,0

To elucidate the mechanism responsible for the regression of LV hypertrophy after treatment, LV mass index (LVMI) by echocardiography, plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (PAC), norepinephrine, and concentration of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) measured before and after treatment. Thirty-six patients were randomly assigned to the NIL, TEM, or CAD groups.

LV function was assessed using radionuclide ejection fraction. 263 patients (51.4%) experienced cardiovascular death and/or LV diastolic dilatation; 279 (54.5%) experienced cardiovascular death and/or systolic dilatation. In 373 patients with serial echocardiograms, LV end-diastolic and end-systolic sizes progressively increased from baseline to 2 years (both P<0.01).

The main study was a randomized controlled clinical trial with four different prospective study designs used in the post-marketing evaluation, involving 1008 primary care practices in nine Canadian provinces. Two thousand nine hundred and sixty-four patients with mild to moderate hypertension received an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (fosinopril 10 to 40 mg daily against day 5) daily for 14 weeks in one of four post-marketing studies—one randomized, double-blind clinical trial (RCT). up to 20 mg enalapril daily), two structured open-label studies with 10 to 40 mg fosinopril daily (one with free drugs) or one unstructured open-label study with 10 to 40 mg fosinopril daily. Patient demographics and baseline characteristics, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, reported adverse events, and data quality were recorded as outcome parameters. The results showed that the RCT patients were titrated to higher doses of ACE inhibitors than patients in the open-label studies, P<0.008; Patients in the open-label studies were more likely to receive adjuvant diuretic therapy, P<0.008. Blood pressure reductions were similar among patients in all four studies, with mean decreases in systolic blood pressure ranging from 18 to 20 mm Hg and mean decreases in diastolic blood pressure ranging from 11 to 13 mm Hg. Fewer patients in the unstructured, open-label study reported adverse events than patients in the RCT; a 55% relative reduction in reported adverse events (P<0.008) was associated with the unstructured study. There were also fewer drug-related adverse events per patient reported in the unstructured study (17 per 100 patients) than in the other studies (27 to 41 per 100 patients), P<0.008. Physician preference to round blood pressure measurements down to 0 or 5 was most common in the unstructured open-label study (p<0.008). In conclusion, despite differences in dose titration and in the use of adjuvant therapy, the efficacy of antihypertensive drug therapy observed in an RCT may be similar to that seen in uncontrolled post-marketing studies. Open-label studies with planned follow-up are as effective as RCTs in detecting serious adverse events, but post-marketing studies with unstructured follow-up plans are insufficient to identify drug-related adverse events and have poorer data quality.",0,0

Both nifedipine GITS and enalapril reduced proteinuria by 37%. Patients had increasing levels or proteinuria proportional to higher ambient sodium intake (r=0.48; p<0.01). This effect was enhanced during nifedipine-GITS therapy compared to enalapril.; Nifedipine GITS were superior to enalapril in controlling ambulatory blood pressure, but they were equivalent (37%) in reducing proteinuria. They had different effects on neural activation and duration of action. Increased protein excretion appears to be associated with increased sodium intake.

2273,9408513,Oral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Verme-Gibboney, C","The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical uses, side effects, drug interactions, dosage, cost, and therapeutic replacement of oral angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are reviewed. ACE inhibitors dampen the formation of angiotension II and can lead to the accumulation of kinins. Although the blood pressure-lowering effects of many ACE inhibitors can last for 24 hours, some patients require more than one dose per day to achieve adequate control. These agents accumulate in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction, but it's unclear if dose adjustments are needed. ACE inhibitors are effective against mild to moderate high blood pressure; If you have severe high blood pressure, you may need additional antihypertensive drugs. Other conditions in which ACE inhibitors have been shown to be effective include congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, chronic renal failure, insulin sensitivity, and coronary artery disease. The most common side effect is a persistent nonproductive cough. Angioedema, fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, acute renal failure, and hyperkalemia can also occur. ACE inhibitors can interact with diuretics, lithium, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral hypoglycemic drugs, and some other drugs. Therapy with ACE inhibitors should be started with low doses, which can then be slowly adjusted upwards. Many of the remedies have similar costs for lower and higher dosages. The only significant differences between the ACE inhibitors are the time of onset of the antihypertensive effect, the time to the maximum effect, and the duration of the effect. Each formulation should contain at least captopril and one intermediate-acting and one long-acting ACE inhibitor.",0,0

There is a need to evaluate the efficacy and safety of novel MI treatments in this high-risk population. We investigated whether treatment with an ACE inhibitor started within 24 hours of symptom onset can reduce mortality and morbidity in diabetics with acute MI; A retrospective analysis of data from the GISSI-3 study in patients with and without a history of diabetes was performed. Patients suspected of having acute MI were randomly assigned to treatment with lisinopril (2.5 to 5 up to 10 mg/day) with or without nitroglycerin (5 to 20 micrograms IV then 10 mg/day) starting within 24 hours and continued for 6 weeks. The main endpoint was mortality at 6 weeks and the secondary endpoint was a combined assessment of mortality and severe left ventricular dysfunction. Diabetes status information was available for 18,131 patients (approximately 94% of the total included population), of which 2,790 patients had a history of diabetes. Treatment with lisinopril was associated with reduced 6-week mortality in diabetics (8.7% vs. 12.4%; OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.86; 37 +/- 12 rescued lives per 1000 patients treated), an effect that was significantly (p<0.025) higher than in non-diabetic patients. The survival benefit in diabetics was largely maintained at 6 months despite treatment discontinuation at 6 weeks (12.9% vs. 16.1%; OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95); Early treatment with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in diabetic patients with acute MI is associated with reduced 6-week mortality. This beneficial effect supports broad and early use of ACE inhibitors in diabetics with acute MI. The burden of mortality plus morbidity for ventricular dysfunction in diabetics remains clinically significant and warrants further testing of new therapeutic approaches.",1,1

Angiotensin (AT1) receptor blockers do not appear to share the potentiation of this biosystem. We tested whether losartan improves exercise VO2 in CHF and whether the effect is the same as enalapril. Sixteen men with CHF and 8 volunteers, all non-smokers and not taking ACE, AT1 receptor or cyclooxygenase inhibitors, were randomized to receive placebo, enalapril (10 mg bid), losartan (50 mg/day), each of these two drugs plus aspirin (325 mg/day), aspirin, or the same preparations in reverse order, each for 3 weeks, with a 3-week washout period between treatments. Lung function and VO2 were assessed at the end of each treatment. In CHF, losartan and enalapril produced similar improvements in VO2 and exercise tolerance that were absent in controls and counteracted by aspirin (prostaglandin inhibition) when given with enalapril and not losartan. With enalapril, we also found an increase in lung carbon monoxide diffusing capacity that correlated with changes in VO2 and was antagonized by aspirin, suggesting the possibility that prostaglandin-mediated functional enhancement of the alveolar capillary membrane contributes to the increase in VO2. Thus, losartan is as effective as enalapril for exercise VO2 and exercise tolerance, but the mechanism appears to be separate from activation of the prostaglandin biosystem. Losartan may represent an advance in CHF since its potency on VO2 is similar to that of enalapril but is not antagonized by aspirin.",0,0

In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, irbesartan 150 or 300 mg once daily, with or without the addition of antihypertensive medicinal products, provides effective 24-hour blood pressure control. Irbesartan reduced blood pressure to a similar extent as enalapril and atenolol and to a significantly greater extent than losartan. The combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide produced additive antihypertensive effects. The drug is effective in elderly patients and no dose adjustment is necessary in these patients or in patients with kidney or liver failure. Preliminary studies evaluating the effectiveness of irbesartan in patients with heart failure have provided encouraging results. Irbesartan is very well tolerated and neither the frequency nor the pattern of side effects differed from those observed in placebo recipients, although headache was significantly more common in the latter. Likewise, the incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between irbesartan and enalapril in patients receiving either active substance as monotherapy. Headaches, upper respiratory tract infections and musculoskeletal pain were the most common complaints. Thus, irbesartan is an effective therapy for patients with mild to moderate hypertension and had a similar side effect profile to placebo in clinical trials.

To assess a potential role of the renin-angiotensin system in mediating this phenomenon, we co-treated patients with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril.; The anti-ischemic efficacy of organic nitrates is quickly blunted by the development of nitrate tolerance. The underlying mechanisms are most likely multifactorial and may involve increased vasoconstrictor responsiveness.; Forearm blood flow and vascular resistance were determined using strain gauge plethysmography. Short-term responses to intra-arterial angiotensin II (1, 3, 9, and 27 ng/min) and phenylephrine (an alpha-adrenergic agonist, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1 microgram/min) were evaluated in 40 male patients with stable blood pressure examined coronary artery disease. These patients were randomized into four groups to receive 48-hour treatment with NTG (0.5 micrograms/kg body weight per minute) or placebo with or without the ACE inhibitor captopril (25 mg three times a day); In patients treated with NTG alone, the maximum reduction in forearm blood flow in response to angiotensin II and phenylephrine was significantly greater (-64 +/- 3% and -53 +/- 4%, respectively) than in patients treated with received placebo (-41 +/- 2% and -42 +/- 2%, respectively). Captopril treatment completely prevented NTG-induced hypersensitivity to angiotensin II and phenylephrine (-33 +/- 3% and -35 +/- 3%, respectively), but had no significant effect on blood flow responses in patients without NTG treatment ( -34 +/- 2% and -37 +/- 3%, respectively.; We conclude that continuous administration of NTG is associated with increased sensitivity to phenylephrine and angiotensin II, which is prevented by concomitant treatment with captopril. The prevention of NTG-induced hypersensitivity to vasoconstrictors by ACE inhibition suggests an involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in mediating this phenomenon.",0,0

Left ventricular mass, adjusted for sex and height, correlated significantly with clinical systolic and diastolic blood pressure both before (r = 0.57 and r = 0.48, P < 0.001) and during antihypertensive therapy (r = 0, 43, P<0.001 and r=0.27, P<0.05). Changes in left ventricular mass were significantly associated with changes in blood pressure. The correlation coefficients were 0.39 (P<0.01) and 0.40 (P<0.01) for the conventional and automated measurements of clinical systolic blood pressure, respectively, and 0.45 (P<0.001) for the mean 24-day systolic hour blood pressure; these r-values were 0.27 (NS), 0.20 (NS), and 0.43 (P<0.01) for diastolic blood pressure, respectively. Mean 24-hour blood pressure contributed 7.4% (P<0.05) and 6.2% (P=0.06) to the variance in mass changes explained by conventional and automated measurements of clinical systolic blood pressure, respectively and 11.2% (P<0.05) and 14.5% (P<0.01) for diastolic blood pressure. Changes in daytime and nocturnal blood pressure significantly (P<0.01) and to a similar extent predicted changes in left ventricular mass, regardless of analysis method.; Treatment-induced changes in left ventricular mass were significantly associated with changes in clinical, 24-hour, daytime, and nocturnal blood pressure; the changes in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure contribute to the variance in changes in left ventricular mass explained by clinical blood pressure data.",0,0

Tight glycemic control can only partially reduce the development and progression of retinopathy. Blood pressure is also a risk factor for microvascular complications. Antihypertensive therapy, particularly with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, may slow the progression of nephropathy, but effects on retinopathy have not been demonstrated. We examined the effect of lisinopril on retinopathy in type 1 diabetes.; In a 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we took retinal photographs at baseline and at follow-up (24 months) in patients aged 20 to 59 years in 15 European centers. Patients were not hypertensive and normoalbuminuric (85%) or microalbuminuric. Retinopathy was classified using photographs on a five-point scale (none to proliferative).; The proportion of patients with retinopathy at baseline was 65% (117) in the placebo group and 59% (103) in the lisinopril group (p=0.2). Patients on lisinopril had significantly lower HbA1c at baseline than patients on placebo (6.9% vs. 7.3 p=0.05). Retinopathy progressed by at least one grade in 21 (13.2%) of 159 patients on lisinopril and 39 (23.4%) of 166 patients on placebo (odds ratio 0.50 [95% CI 0.28-0 .89], p=0.02). This 50% reduction was the same when adjusted for center and glycemic control (0.55 [0.30-1.03], p=0.06). Lisinopril also reduced progression by two or more grades (0.27 [0.07-1.00], p=0.05) and progression to proliferative retinopathy (0.18 [0.04-0.82], p=0.03). Progression was not associated with albuminuric status at baseline. Treatment reduced the incidence of retinopathy (0.69 [0.30-1.59], p=0.4); Lisinopril may reduce the progression of retinopathy in non-hypertensive patients with type 1 diabetes and little or no nephropathy. These results need to be confirmed before changes in clinical practice can be endorsed.",1,0

2286,9442441,Are me-too drugs justified?,,"Garattini, S","The successful advance of pharmacology in the treatment of various diseases has led to the development of a powerful pharmaceutical industry with an estimated market of over $250 billion. It is therefore understandable that drug development and commercialization has become an important business and has taken over the rules that apply to other commercial areas. This is a potentially dangerous trend as it undermines the primary goal of drug development, which is to provide the patient with drugs with accurate and reliable information at the lowest possible cost, especially when a national healthcare system is required to deliver the drugs to patients who are under-income have to pay them. The huge drug market has also fueled competition among pharmaceutical companies. This has meant that as soon as a prototype drug becomes available, several other similarly active compounds will immediately follow. These followers are usually referred to as ""me-too drugs"". Me-too drugs can be broadly defined as being chemically related to the prototype or other chemical compounds with an identical mechanism of action. This increasing marketing of me-too drugs has been challenged, leading pharmaceutical companies to justify developing less-innovative drugs. The most common arguments can be summarized as follows: me-too drugs offer an improvement in the effectiveness of the prototype; they show a different side effect profile; they are effective in patients resistant to the prototype; they improve compliance in long-term treatment; They are cheaper than the prototype. The aim of this paper is to review the evidence supporting these statements, provide some figures on me-too drugs and present some examples.",0,0
2287,9443770,Effect of bisoprolol and captopril on insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in essential hypertension.,,"Dominguez, L J; Barbagallo, M; Jacober, S J; Jacobs, D B; Sowers, J R","Angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers have been reported to have differential effects on insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the selective beta-1 blocker bisoprolol and the ACE inhibitor captopril on the cellular action of insulin in hypertensive patients. After the washout, 12 mild to moderate essential hypertensive subjects were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive bisoprolol 5 mg daily or captopril 25 mg twice daily for 8 weeks. Erythrocyte insulin binding and insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase (TK) activity were measured before and after therapy. Both drugs significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure (bisoprolol 96.5 +/- 0.9 to 87.8 +/- 3.1 mm Hg; captopril 96.5 +/- 0.9 to 91.5 +/- 1, 8mmHg; P<0.05). Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin/glucose indices remained unchanged after both therapies, as did lipid profiles. The maximal insulin-stimulated TK activity, determined by phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate Poly-Glu80Tyr20, was significantly higher (P<0.05) after bisoprolol treatment but not after captopril treatment compared to placebo (bisoprolol 8.5+ /- 1.8; captopril 7.3 +/- 1.5; placebo: 6.4 +/- 1.3 pmol 32P-ATP/fmol bound insulin). However, captopril, but not bisoprolol, increased the sensitivity of receptor TK activity as measured by the half-maximal activity concentration (ED50). Specific insulin binding was not affected by either of these agents. Thus, both captopril and bisoprolol may have beneficial but distinct effects on TK activity and insulin action at the cellular level.",0,0

All patients received either thrombolytic therapy (n = 46) or underwent primary coronary artery angioplasty (n = 25). Medication was started within 48 hours of hospital admission and continued for 48 weeks. The process of left ventricular remodeling was assessed with two-dimensional echocardiography 3 weeks and 1 year after acute onset and related to the severity of residual stenosis of the infarcted artery.; Left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline was 39.2% +/- 8.7%. During the study period, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index increased from 48.2 +/- 9.9 ml.m-2 to 54.6 +/- 12.2 ml.m-2 at 3 weeks and to 59.4 +/- 17 .0 ml.m-2 after 1 year I control patients (P < 0.001).

We used Cox regression to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics and to test the interaction between APA use and selected patient variables related to outcome.; The use of APA (46.3% of patients) was associated with a significantly reduced all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73 to 0.92, p=0, 0005) and a reduced risk of death or hospitalization associated with heart failure (adjusted HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.89, p<0.0001), but was not affected by study allocation, gender, LV ejection fraction, class of the New York Heart Association or etiology. A strong interaction was observed between the use of APA, the randomization group, and all-cause mortality. The association between APA use and survival was not observed in the enalapril group, nor was there a demonstrable benefit of enalapril on survival in patients who received APAs at baseline. However, randomization to enalapril therapy significantly reduced the composite endpoint of death or hospitalization for heart failure in APA users.; In patients with LV systolic dysfunction, use of APAs is associated with improved survival and reduced morbidity.

However, it is not known whether this natriuretic effect persists despite decreased renal function.; Comparison of the natriuretic capacity of the gastrointestinal therapeutic system nifedipine (GITS) and lisinopril in patients with mild to moderate chronic renal failure.; An open-label, randomized comparative study was conducted to compare the natriuretic capacity of nifedipine GITS and lisinopril in mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-80 ml/min). After a wash-out phase of 4 weeks, an intravenous saline infusion (30 ml/kg body weight isotonic saline in 4 h) was carried out and repeated after 4 weeks of active therapy. Two sex- and age-matched groups of hypertensive patients (n = 25) were included in the study. Renal failure was diagnosed in all patients as secondary to nephrosclerosis.; A significant increase in renal capacity to eliminate sodium burden was observed in patients receiving nifedipine GITS (n=11) but not in patients taking lisinopril (n=13). Both drugs controlled blood pressure to a similar extent. No changes in body weight, glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow (measured as inulin and paraaminohippurate clearance) were observed. A significant decrease in urinary albumin excretion was observed after lisinopril but not after nifedipine. Heart rate was higher in the nifedipine group.; The natriuretic capacity of nifedipine-GITS is preserved despite the presence of mild to moderate chronic renal failure.

Patients were randomized to receive either conventional antihypertensive therapy (diuretics and/or beta-blockers) or captopril-based treatment. A prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded study design (PROBE) will be used to compare these two regimens for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The rationale for the CAPPP study is the many observations of beneficial effects of ACE inhibition compared to diuretics and beta-blockers on intermediate endpoints such as insulin sensitivity, serum lipoproteins, left ventricular hypertrophy and renal function. Captopril has also proven to be extremely effective in the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure. The hypothesis is that these differences could lead to improved risk reduction when ACE inhibitors are used in the treatment of hypertension. The present work describes the basic data and the changes in blood pressure in the first year of the entire cohort. In the first year, the average blood pressure was reduced by 11/8 mm Hg. A number of sub-studies were carried out in the CAPPP study. In one such case, insulin sensitivity was compared in a subgroup of patients using the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. In another partial study, the ACE gene was sequenced and some new polymorphisms were discovered. Several other partial studies are in progress or in the planning phase. The main results of the CAPPP study should be available by mid-1998. Some of the intended analyzes of the final results, as well as other planned sub-studies, are briefly described here.",0,0

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition appears to have a specific renoprotective role in diabetic nephropathy, possibly by reducing intraglomerular pressure. The acute effects of ACE inhibition on renal hemodynamics in normotensive non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM ) have not been reported so far. We measured concomitant glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) in 29 (4 female) subjects with a mean age of 52 years (range 27-70) using 51Cr-EDTA and 125I-hippuran. The distances have been corrected to 1.73 m(-2). All patients were normotensive (BP < 75th percentile for age and sex), newly diagnosed (< 30 days), and not taking antihypertensive or hypoglycemic drugs. Subjects were randomized (double-blind) to the ACE inhibitor trandolapril 4 mg day(-1)(H) (hypotensive dose), trandolapril 0.5 mg day(-1)(L) (non-hypotensive dose), or placebo (P ) allocated. for 10 days, after which renal hemodynamics were measured again. In all subjects, baseline GFR, RPF, and filtration fraction (FF) were 97+/-21 mL min(-1) mean +/- SD, 439+/-120 mL min(-1), and 22.3+/-, respectively. 2.9%. Glomerular hyperfiltration (GFR > 120 ml min[-1]) was detected in only 3 subjects (10.3%).

The study design was a two-period, parallel, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design in which 11 subjects received perindopril and 10 subjects received amlodipine during the run-in period. The addition of amlodipine to perindopril had no effect on ambulatory blood pressure, whereas the addition of perindopril to amlodipine reduced both systolic (P=0.027) and diastolic (P=0.049) ambulatory blood pressure.

The addition of perindopril to amlodipine decreased serum ACE by 72% and increased PRA two-fold without changing plasma levels of Ang II, aldosterone, or alpha-h-ANP. The addition of amlodipine to perindopril increased plasma aldosterone 1.7-fold but had no effect on serum ACE, PRA, Ang II, or alpha-h-ANP. These interactions between perindopril and amlodipine could be due to the specific effects of the therapy administered first as well as the different circumstances of blood pressure measurement (ambulatory vs. clinical).",0,0

Demographic and clinical information was obtained for each patient, and each coronary unit was classified by patient volume, level of technology, and large geographic area in which it was located. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with administration of thrombolytic therapy as dependent variable and previously defined clinical and structural variables as independent variables.; The most important factor in administering thrombolytic therapy was that the time from symptom onset to hospital admission was less than 6 hours (odds ratio [OR] 14.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.3 to 16.0). Next, the location of the coronary ward in southern Italy (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.62 to 2.01), the presence of ST elevation on baseline electrocardiogram ECG (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1, 35 to 1.61), the absence of a prior myocardial infarction (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.49), and having a cath lab or cardiac surgery program or both at the same hospital (OR 1.24; 95% CI 1 .14 to 1.35).

After a 2-week placebo run-in period, hypertensive patients were treated with either trandolapril 2 mg once daily or perindopril 4 mg once daily for 4 weeks in a double-blind design. A placebo was then administered for 1 week. Three periods of one-week home self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) were programmed: the end of the placebo run-in period, the end of the treatment period, and the final placebo withdrawal period. Three consecutive measurements each in the evening and in the morning were requested daily. In the subgroup of patients who responded to therapy (evening diastolic SMBP drop > or = 6 mmHg), individual return to baseline BP was assessed. The ratio (R) of the mean DBP reduction after taking the drug (residual effect) versus the evening DBP reduction while taking the drug (full effect) was used to examine the return to baseline. Patients with a value lower than the median of this ratio were referred to as reverters, while others were referred to as nonreverters. One hundred and nineteen patients entered the analysis. During the treatment period, mean SMBP decreased significantly from 150 +/- 14/97 +/- 7 mm Hg to 139 +/- 15/91 +/- 9 mm Hg (all P < 0.001). Drug-treated BP in the evening was similar in both treatment groups. However, both morning systolic and diastolic SMBP levels were significantly lower in the trandolapril group. After drug discontinuation, mean blood pressure increased significantly to 144 +/- 14/94 +/- 9 mm Hg (all P = 0.01), but remained lower than baseline BP values (P = 0.003 for SBP and P = 0.003). 002 for DBP). Post-dose blood pressure was significantly lower in the trandolapril group than in the perindopril group. 74 patients responded to the therapy. In this subgroup, the median R-ratio used to analyze return to baseline after drug discontinuation was 44%. Non-reverters were characterized by a sustained reduction in blood pressure on medication compared to reverters. We therefore conclude that withdrawal of ACE inhibitor treatment is accompanied by a rapid rise in blood pressure (within 48 hours), followed by a 5-day plateau in blood pressure that is lower than baseline. Patients who returned to baseline after drug discontinuation were more likely to have inadequate control during therapy, particularly in the mornings. The longer duration of action of trandolapril was associated with lower blood pressure both in the morning during the active treatment phase and in the 1-week follow-up phase.",0,0

Incidence, Prevention and Management.",,"Vleeming, W; van Amsterdam, J G; Stricker, B H; de Wildt, D J","Available information from 1980 to 1997 on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema and the underlying mechanisms are summarized and discussed. The incidence of angioedema is low (0.1 to 0.2%) but can be considered a potentially life-threatening side effect of ACE inhibitor therapy. This undesirable effect of ACE inhibitors, regardless of the chemical structure, can occur at the beginning of treatment as well as after prolonged exposure up to several years. The estimated incidence is quite underestimated. The actual incidence may be much higher due to the poorly recognized presentation of angioedema as a result of its late onset in combination with what is usually long-term therapy. Spontaneous reporting bias may also contribute to an actual higher incidence of this phenomenon. In certain risk groups, such as black Americans, the incidence can be even higher (up to 3-fold). Treatment consists of immediate withdrawal of the ACE inhibitor and acute symptomatic supportive therapy, followed by immediate (and long-term) alternative therapy with other classes of drugs used to treat hypertension and/or heart failure. Preclinical and clinical studies aimed at elucidating the underlying mechanism(s) of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema have not reached firm conclusions. Immunological processes and several mediator systems (bradykinin, histamine, substance P and prostaglandins) are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of angioedema. A large proportion of all reviewed reports suggest an association between ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema and elevated tissue bradykinin levels. However, no conclusive evidence for the role of bradykinin in angioedema has been found and an exclusive role for bradykinin seems unlikely. So far, no clear evidence of an immune-mediated pathogenesis could be found.

Treatment periods were separated by a 6-week placebo washout period.; Ambulances in Greater Belfast.; Fifteen white non-diabetic essential hypertensive patients (seven males) aged < 65 years recruited from general practices in the Greater Belfast area.; Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and peripheral and hepatic insulin action.; Two patients failed to complete the study. Blood pressure was reduced (139/89 +/- 18/7 mmHg combination versus 160/97 +/- 21/7 mmHg captopril; P<0.001). Fasting insulin levels were elevated (7.9 +/- 3.6 mU/L combination versus 6.2 +/- 3.2 mU/L baseline; p<0.001). There were no differences between treatments for glucose, urate, cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The serum potassium level was decreased (3.8 +/- 0.4 mmol/l combination versus 4.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l captopril, P < 0.05). Postabsorptive endogenous glucose production was increased (combination 10.8 +/- 1.7 micromol/kg per minute versus 10.0 +/- 1.5 micromol/kg captopril per minute; P<0.01) and greater than that Baseline (9.7 +/- 2.1 micromoles/kg per combination). min, P<0.05). The suppression of glucose production by insulin was similar for both treatments.

2327,9535416,Three candidate genes and cough associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors: a pharmacogenetic analysis.,,"Zee, R Y; Rao, V S; Paster, R Z; Sweet, C S; Lindpaintner, K","Unexplained, persistent cough limits the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in a significant number of patients. It has been speculated that the onset of this adverse effect is genetically predetermined; in particular, variants of the genes encoding ACE, chymase and the B2 bradykinin receptor have been involved. To investigate this question, we genotyped common polymorphisms for these three genes in subjects with a history of ACE inhibitor-related cough. The specificity of the adverse reaction was confirmed by a blinded, double-crossover design protocol in which subjects were re-treated with either lisinopril or placebo. In 99 case subjects and 70 control subjects (who did not develop a cough upon rechallenge with ACE inhibitors) thus selected, the frequencies for the ACE D and I alleles were 0.56 and 0.44 (cases) and 0, respectively .56 and 0.44 (controls); Frequencies for chymase A and B alleles (absence/presence of the BstXI site) were 0.56 and 0.44 (cases) and 0.46 and 0.54 (controls), respectively; Frequencies for B2 bradykinin receptor + and - alleles (presence/absence of a 21 to 29 nonanucleotide sequence) were 0.52 and 0.48 (cases) and 0.53 and 0.47 (controls), respectively. All observed genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no evidence of an association between the genotype of either gene studied and cough (adjusted for sex and age). Our data indicate that common genetic variants of ACE, chymase, and B2 bradykinin receptor do not explain the occurrence of ACE inhibitor-associated cough.",0,0

The Italian Microalbuminuria Study Group at IDDM.,,"Crepaldi, G; Carta, Q; Deferrari, G; Mangili, R; Navalesi, R; Santeusanio, F; Spalluto, A; Vanasia, A; Villa, G M; Nosadini, R","Intervention studies of renal function in IDDM patients with microalbuminuria (MA) should use the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as an outcome measure. However, normotensive IDDM patients with MA show no change in GFR over a 10-year follow-up period. Therefore, in the present study, we used the cumulative incidence of progression to albuminuria (albumin excretion rate [AER] > 200 micrograms/min) of MA as the primary endpoint and the annual increase in AER at a rate of 50% above baseline as the secondary endpoint of kidney function.; Ninety-two normotensive IDDM patients underwent double-blind, double-dummy treatment with either lisinopril or slow-release nifedipine versus placebo. Ten patients discontinued the study during the 3-year follow-up period.; During the 3-year follow-up, 7 of 34 placebo-treated (20.6%), 2 of 32 lisinopril-treated (6.3%), and 2 of 26 nifedipine-treated (7.7%) patients developed clinical albuminuria ( Fisher's exact test, P<0.03). Time-to-event analysis showed a 58.1% (95% CI 27.8-68.4%) reduction in risk of progression to macroalbuminuria in the 32 patients receiving lisinopril (p<0.02) and um 62.5% (95% CI 32.5-73.4). %) in the 26 patients on nifedipine (P<0.02) after adjustment for mean blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, and baseline AER compared to the 34 patients on placebo. The baseline AER was 71 micrograms/min (range: 20.7-187.3) in progressors and 73 micrograms/min (range: 20.2-174.1) in non-progressors (NS). The percentage of patients showing an annual increase in AER of >50% from baseline was significantly lower in the lisinopril group (13 of 32, 40.6%, p<0.02) but not in the nifedipine group group (15 of 26, 57.7%) than in the placebo group (23 of 34, 67.6%). The lisinopril group had significantly lower blood pressure readings during follow-up than either the nifedipine (p<0.05) or placebo (p<0.01) group.; Our data show that both lisinopril and nifedipine are effective in delaying the onset of macroalbuminuria in IDDM patients with normal blood pressure and MA. Since apparent proteinuria strongly predicts end-stage renal failure, both treatments appear capable of preventing such a complication in IDDM patients with normal blood pressure and MA. However, lisinopril appears to be more potent in slowing the progression of nephropathy.",0,0

After 6 weeks of treatment, the daily dose was doubled in patients whose sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) remained > or = 90 mmHg; Patients with essential hypertension with a mean trough SiDBP of 95-115 mmHg after the placebo baseline period were randomized to treatment with losartan (N=192) or captopril (N=204); The primary efficacy variable was the mean change in SiDBP trough from baseline to week 12. Safety was assessed by recording spontaneously reported or observed adverse events and clinical laboratory measurements.; At 12 weeks, both treatments resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in trough SiDBP and sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP). These mean reductions (SiDBP, SiSBP) were significantly greater in the losartan group (-11.5 and -15.4 mm Hg, respectively) than in the captopril group (-9.3 and -12.2 mm Hg, respectively) (p=0.010 for diastolic and p=0.023 for systolic).

Eighteen patients were randomized in a double-blind crossover design to receive each of the four different drugs for 8 weeks. The ABPM was performed at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment with these drugs. A 2- to 3-week washout period occurred both at baseline and between each of the four medications. Three patients were excluded from the statistical analysis because of technical problems with the ABPM. Atenolol, isradipine SRO, and spirapril significantly reduced mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure (p<0.01), while HCTZ did not. Mean 24-hour diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly after all four drugs: 12 (SD+/-14) mmHg with atenolol, 7 (SD+/-10) mmHg with isradipine SRO, 3 mmHg (SD+/-14) with HCTZ and 6 (SD +/- 15) mm Hg with spirapril (p<0.01). During the night, neither drug significantly lowered mean diastolic or systolic blood pressure. According to the 24-hour blood pressure curve, the influence of these four drugs was not similar throughout the measurement period. Atenolol and spirapril lost their antihypertensive effects in the early hours of the morning. The antihypertensive effect of HCTZ varied significantly from hour to hour. The unmedicated trough-to-peak ratio was > 0.50. A negative correlation was observed between apnea time and mean 24-hour systolic value (r = -0.604, P = NS) and mean nocturnal systolic blood pressure change (r = -0.590, P = NS).

This double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled, multicenter, outpatient study evaluated the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of a calcium channel blocker (verapamil SR) and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (trandolapril) in patients with mild to moderate (stages I and II) essential Hypertension. This 10-week study enrolled 631 patients. After a 4-week single-blind placebo phase, patients received one of the following daily dosing regimens in a double-blind manner for 6 weeks: placebo, trandolapril 4 mg, verapamil SR 240 mg, or a combination of trandolapril 4 mg and verapamil SR 240 mg. Seated diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 4.5 mm Hg, 4.3 mm Hg, and 8.1 mm Hg more than placebo in the trandolapril, verapamil SR, and combination groups. In the combination group, the seated diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by 3.6 mmHg more than in the trandolapril group and by 3.8 mmHg more than in the verapamil-SR group (P<0.01). Analysis of trough-to-peak ratios for seated diastolic blood pressure resulted in values of 0.75 and 0.67 for the trandolapril 4 mg and combination groups, respectively, at endpoint.

2338,9551877,Relationship between salt and blood pressure in hypertensive patients on chronic ACE inhibition.,,"Herlitz, H; DahlÃ¶f, B; Jonsson, O; Friberg, P","We studied the effect of 4-day oral salt intake (150 mmol NaCl extra per day) on blood pressure, erythrocyte sodium transport, and activity in the renin-angiotensin system in six men with primary hypertension reaching normotonia on chronic enalapril had treatment for 4 years. The design was a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, two-way crossover study, ie each patient served as their own control. The intracellular sodium and potassium content of the erythrocytes was measured by flame photomometry. The increase in intracellular sodium concentration during a 1 hour incubation of whole blood with ouabain (compared to no-ouabain) at 37°C was measured to determine the rate of active sodium efflux. A 24-hour blood pressure recording was performed with a Space Lab device (SL 90202) before and at the end of the salt exposure. Left ventricular morphology was assessed with echocardiography and minimal vascular resistance of the hand vascular bed with water plethysmography at baseline and after 4 years on enalapril. Four years of treatment with enalapril resulted in a significant decrease in blood pressure, left ventricular mass and minimal vascular resistance. During the 4-day salt exposure, mean 24-hour blood pressure was significantly increased, 129+/-3/85+/-2 mmHg compared to 124+/-2/82+/-2 mmHg during placebo treatment ( p=0.025). The change (delta) in MAP during high salt intake showed a negative relationship with the delta sodium efflux rate constant (r = -0.65, p = 0.047). No significant association was found between blood pressure response to salt exposure and structural cardiovascular changes. In conclusion, short-term oral salt exposure in hypertensive patients on chronic enalapril treatment caused an increase in blood pressure that was related to cellular sodium transport but not to structural cardiovascular changes.",0,0

The hypercontractile state of the heart could be alleviated by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors by suppressing CA release from the sympathetic nerve ending. Thus, ACE inhibitors could have a positive effect on the prevention of NMS. In this study, 24 elderly subjects who had reproducible NMS induced by the head-up tilt test (HUT) were randomized and double-blind to placebo and ACE inhibitor groups. Plasma CA concentration [norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E)] was measured during HUT and the effects of enalapril on NMS were observed in both groups. Before the administration of enalapril, plasma CA concentrations were significantly increased during HUT compared to those in the supine position; In contrast, administration of enalapril (10 mg/day) for > 1 year inhibited the increase in plasma CA concentration and prevented syncope in all 12 patients (p<0.05); However, placebo had no effect on plasma CA concentrations, and syncope resolved in only two of 12 patients after administration of placebo. From this study we conclude that enalapril can prevent NMS in patients, presumably due to its role in inhibiting CA release from sympathetic nerve terminals.",0,0

To date, no large multicenter study of AMI has provided information on LV thrombosis. The protocol of the GISSI-3 study included searching for the presence of LV thrombosis in patients from 200 coronary units that did not specifically focus on LV thrombosis. We examined the results of the GISSI-3 database in relation to 8,326 patients at low to intermediate risk for LV thrombi for whom a pre-discharge echocardiogram (9 +/- 5 days) was available. LV thrombosis was found in 427 patients (5.1%): 292 of 2544 patients (11.5%) with anterior AMI and 135 of 5782 patients (2.3%) with AMI at other sites (p<0 .0001).

In both cases, the choice of treatment depends on its effectiveness and side effects. With regard to acute drug therapy, group studies do not suggest that ergot derivatives and sumatriptan are superior to simple analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, especially when a prokinetic is added. These new drugs are indicated for severe attacks that are unresponsive to more conventional therapies. Chronic substance abuse can produce drug-induced or rebound headaches. With regard to long-term prophylaxis, group studies indicate that calcium antagonists and drugs that influence 5-HT are superior to beta-blockers in terms of the frequency of attacks, but have very frequent side effects (weight gain and somnolence). Interesting preliminary results have also been reported with valproate and enalapril, which are confirmed by controlled studies.

Treatment and administration assignments were double-blind. Ambulatory blood pressure was monitored 24 hours before and after 6 and 12 weeks of therapy. Renal hemodynamics were determined on the first day of drug administration and 12 and 24 h after the last dose during chronic treatment.; Administration of each antihypertensive agent induced renal vasodilation with no significant change in glomerular filtration rate.

Whether antihypertensive treatment can normalize the wall hypertrophy of the conducting arteries has not yet been determined.; Seventy-seven elderly hypertensive patients were randomized to receive 9 months of double-blind treatment with perindopril (2 to 8 mg/day) or the diuretic combination of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 50 mg/day) plus amiloride (1.25 to 5 mg/day ). ) after a 1-month washout period with placebo. If systolic blood pressure remained > 160 mm Hg after 5 months, chlorthalidone or atenolol was added. Arterial variables, including radial artery mass and common carotid artery compliance, were calculated from noninvasive measurements of internal diameter and wall thickness using high-resolution echotracking systems at baseline and at 5 and 9 months.; During treatment, blood pressure and arterial variables changed to the same extent in both groups. After 9 months of treatment, systolic, diastolic and pulse pressures as well as radial artery wall thickness, mass and thickness/radius ratio decreased significantly (p<0.01), while carotid compliance increased (p<0.001 ). The decrease in radial artery thickness/radius ratio after 9 months of treatment was significantly associated with the reduction in pulse pressure (p<0.01), while the improvement in carotid compliance was associated with the reduction in mean arterial pressure (p<0 ,01) related . In healthy volunteers and untreated hypertensive patients, radial artery diameter, wall thickness and thickness/radius ratio, and carotid artery compliance did not change significantly during a 9-month follow-up period.; These results indicate that in elderly hypertensive patients, both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and diuretic combination treatments may reduce radial artery wall hypertrophy and improve carotid artery compliance.",0,0

After successful cardioversion, patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 treated with sotalol (mean dose 240 mg qd, max 320 mg qd) and group 2 - without sotalol. The stopping criterion was the inability to maintain sinus rhythm. Finally, 17 patients (10 males, 7 females aged 41-60 years) remained in the study; Group 1 included 10 patients and group 2-7 patients. They were assessed by quantitative echocardiography + Doppler and by standard ECG stress test at less than 1 month but more than 2 weeks and at 1, 3 and 6 months. At the first evaluation (2 weeks to 1 month), peak A-wave velocity and atrial filling ratio were higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (37 +/- 10 cm/s versus 20 +/- 5 cm/s and 23 % +/- 7 versus 13% +/- 5) and Group 1 also had a lower exercise tolerance (80 +/- 25 W versus 110 +/- 10 W). There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 in left atrial and left ventricular dimensions, ejection fraction, and E-wave delay time. After 1 month there were no significant differences in Doppler characteristics, echocardiographic parameters and exercise tolerance between the two groups. Group 1 remained at a lower heart rate and had a lower maximum double product (17250 mmHg/min vs. 22100 mmHg/min), corresponding to lower cardiac work. At 3 and 6 months there were no significant changes in any characteristics between the two groups. In conclusion, sotalol appears to be a well-tolerated antiarrhythmic in patients with mild heart failure after conversion of persistent atrial fibrillation. In this situation: 1. Sotalol could reversibly enhance the effect of atrial anesthesia after electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, but this effect is short-lived. 2. Sotalol has no relevant negative inotropic effect, at least not in combination with captopril. 3. Sotalol improves performance.",0,0

We also describe the impact of ACE inhibitor prescriptions, ACE inhibitor dose increases, and non-pharmacological educational interventions on no-result survival rates.; We hypothesize that cardiologist care and higher mean arterial blood pressure at admission are associated with taking optimal ACE inhibitor doses. We hypothesize that taking an ACE inhibitor at discharge and increasing ACE inhibitor dose during hospitalization is associated with superior survival without readmission.; Between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 1993, medical records for consecutively hospitalized patients with a primary diagnosis of heart failure were reviewed at an academic medical center. Documented instructions and medication prescribed at discharge were abstracted. Deaths and readmissions through December 31, 1994 were identified using the National Death Index and the study institution's administrative database, respectively.; In 1992 and 1993, 387 patients were discharged alive from hospitalization for heart failure. Of the patients discharged with enalapril or captopril, 18% received the doses recommended in the heart failure clinical practice guidelines. Patients discharged with a recommended ACE inhibitor dose were more likely to be African American and had lower sodium levels and higher mean arterial pressures than patients discharged with lower ACE inhibitor doses. In survival analyses, increasing the ACE inhibitor dose was associated with improved survival without readmission, regardless of the type of left ventricular systolic function. Taking an ACE inhibitor at discharge was also associated with superior survival without readmission, while non-pharmacological educational briefings were not associated with improved outcomes.; Action is needed to improve the frequency with which ACE inhibitors are prescribed at recommended doses to heart failure hospitalized patients. We conclude that in these patients, taking an ACE inhibitor at discharge and increasing the ACE inhibitor dose during hospitalization are each associated with measurable effects on readmission-free survival while providing educational guidance as currently practiced are practiced is not associated with better results.",0,0

Of these, 28 had anterior wall heart attacks and 24 had posterior wall heart attacks. Infarct size was determined by the creatine kinase integral method. 50 patients were examined 1 and 26 weeks after the infarction using cine magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI). The following parameters were determined: left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume index (LVEDVI, LVESVI), ejection fraction (LVEF), infarct weight and muscle mass (LVMM). At each timepoint, volume-to-mass ratio (VMR) was calculated and clinical status was documented according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) guidelines. The results were compared to those of a historical sample without ACE inhibitor therapy studied in an identical manner (n=31, 10 females, 21 males, 36-75 years); LVEDVI and LVESVI increased by 24.9 and 36.6%, respectively, in the historical sample in the first 6 months after the infarction; by 11.0 and 7.8% with captopril; and by 13.1 and 10.7% with fosinopril, respectively. The LVEF decreased by 14.9% in the untreated sample, by 3.7% with captopril and by 5.0% with fosinopril. Infarct weight and LVMM increased by 12.7 and 15.3%, respectively, in the absence of ACE inhibition, by 5.7 and 10.1%, respectively, in captopril-treated patients, and by 6.1 and 9.3%, respectively, in fosinopril-treated patients . The VMR increased by 7.4% in the historical sample, by 3.5% in the captopril group and by 1.8% in the fosinopril group.

From 107 consecutive donor kidney transplants, complete data available for 74 patients between June 1991 and March 1993 were entered into a form and analyzed. Patients were divided into 6 categories based on antihypertensive or non-prescribed antihypertensive drugs. Group I patients not taking antihypertensive drugs were taken as controls. All patients were matched for age, gender, weight, immunosuppressive therapy, anesthesia, and fluid management during surgery. Patients taking atenolol (plasma K+ levels of 5.34 +/- 0.75 mmol/L in group II and 5.44 +/- 0.63 mmol/L in group III) or captopril ( Serum K+ levels of 5.05 +/- 0.94 mmol/L in group V) in combination with nifedipine and with or without clonidine had significant hyperkalemia than the patient without antihypertensive drugs (serum K+ level was 4.49 +/- 0.71mmol/L). Patients treated with these two antihypertensive drugs often required active treatment of alarming hyperkalemia (blood K+ above 5 mmol/L and high ""T"" wave in lead II) and cardiac arrhythmias. In summary, ESRD patients taking atenolol or captopril need frequent monitoring of blood potassium levels, and it would be wise to avoid using these drugs to control high blood pressure in ESRD patients, especially if a kidney transplant is planned .",0,0

The primary objective of the Fosinopril versus Amlodipine Randomized Cardiovascular Events Trial (FACET) was to compare the effects of fosinopril and amlodipine on serum lipids and diabetes control in NIDDM patients with hypertension. Prospectively defined cardiovascular events were evaluated as secondary endpoints.; Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of NIDDM and hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg). Exclusion criteria included a history of coronary artery disease or stroke, serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL, albuminuria > 40 micrograms/min, and use of lipid-lowering drugs, aspirin, or antihypertensive agents other than beta-blockers or diuretics. A total of 380 hypertensive diabetics were randomized to open-label treatment with fosinopril (20 mg/day) or amlodipine (10 mg/day) and followed for up to 3.5 years.

The 12-week active treatment with perindopril (4-8 mg daily) or carvedilol (25-50 mg daily) was preceded by a 4-week placebo run-in period. Endothelial functions were assessed by assessing hemodynamic (mean blood pressure, leg blood flow) and rheological (platelet aggregation, blood viscosity, and blood filterability) responses to an intravenous bolus of 3 g L-arginine, the natural precursor to nitric oxide.; Both perindopril and carvedilol reduced mean blood pressure significantly (P<0.001) and increased leg blood flow (P<0.05) to the same extent; Blood filterability remained unchanged in both the perindopril and carvedilol groups. Carvedilol reduced platelet aggregation and blood viscosity significantly (p<0.05), but not perindopril.

Overall, GFR decreased linearly by 0.46 +/- 0.05 mL/min/1.73 m2/month (mean rate +/- SEM) over a median follow-up of 23 months (range 3 to 64 months), and the Progression to ESRF was 17.3%. Using multivariate analysis, higher UProt and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were independently correlated with faster delta-GFR (p=0.0001 and p=0.0002, respectively) and progression to ESRF (p=0.0001 and p= 0.003). Mean UProt and systolic blood pressure during follow-up were the only time-dependent covariates that significantly correlated with delta GFR (p=0.005 and p=0.003, respectively) and ESRF (p=0.006 and p=0.0001, respectively). After stratification for UProt at baseline, patients in the bottom tertile (UProt < 1.9 g/24 h) had the slowest delta GFR (0.16 +/- 0.07 mL/min/1.73 m2/month) in comparison and progression to ESRF (4.3%). in patients in the middle tertile (UProt 2.0 to 3.8 g/24 h; Delta GFR, 0.55 +/- 0.09 mL/min/1.73 m2/month, P=0.0002; ESRF, 15.3%, P=0.0001) and in the highest tertile (UProt 3.9 to 18.8 g/24 h; Delta GFR, 0.70 +/- 0.11 ml/min/1.73 m2/ month, P=0.0001;ESRF, 32.5%, P=0.0001). Both delta GFR (P = 0.01) and progression to ESRF (P = 0.01) differed significantly even between the middle and highest tertiles. In contrast, stratification in tertiles of baseline MAP failed to classify the subgroups of patients into different risk levels. Patients with the highest proteinuria and blood pressure were those with the fastest progression (Delta GFR, 0.91 +/- 0.23; ESRF, 34.7%). Interestingly, at each baseline MAP level, higher proteinuria was associated with faster delta-GFR and progression to ESRF. On the other hand, at any grade of proteinuria, faster delta-GFR was associated with MAP only in the highest tertile (>112 mm Hg), and ESRF risk was independent of MAP. Therefore, proteinuria in chronic nephropathies is the best independent predictor of both disease progression and ESRF. Arterial hypertension can contribute to accelerating kidney damage associated with increased transport of plasma proteins. Antihypertensive drugs that most effectively limit protein transport at comparable blood pressure levels are those most effective in slowing disease progression and delaying or preventing ESRF in proteinuric chronic nephropathies.",0,0

Participants were initially preselected for stage I to III hypertension and then further selected for salt sensitivity (> or =5 mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure after 3 weeks of low salt [< or =88 mmol/d Na+] and high salt [> 190 mmol/d Na+] diet). We compared the antihypertensive effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril 5 or 20 mg twice daily) or a calcium channel antagonist (isradipine 5 or 10 mg twice daily) during alternating high and low salt intake. The main target parameter was the change in blood pressure and the absolute blood pressure value achieved with the therapy.

2360,9577953,Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Brown, N J; Vaughan, D E","ACE inhibitors have achieved widespread use in the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases. ACE inhibitors alter the balance between the vasoconstrictive, saline, and hypertrophic properties of angiotensin II (Ang II) and the vasodilatory and natriuretic properties of bradykinin, and alter the metabolism of a number of other vasoactive substances. ACE inhibitors differ in the chemical structure of their active components, potency, bioavailability, plasma half-life, route of elimination, distribution and affinity for tissue-bound ACE, and whether they are administered as prodrugs. Thus, the side effects of ACE inhibitors can be divided into class-specific and drug-specific side effects. ACE inhibitors decrease systemic vascular resistance without increasing heart rate and promote natriuresis. They have been shown to be effective in treating hypertension, reducing mortality in congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, and delaying the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Ongoing studies will elucidate the effect of ACE inhibitors on cardiovascular mortality in essential hypertension, the role of ACE inhibitors in patients without ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, and the role of ACE inhibitors compared to newly available angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists .",0,0

The AUC of the active ingredient imidaprilat averaged 211 (101 sd) ng ml(-1) h after the first dose and 240 (55 sd) ng ml(-1) h at steady state. Maximum ACE inhibition was 75% after a single dose and at steady state. Pre-drug ACE inhibition at day 28 (ie nadir) was 50%. The (placebo-corrected) maximum fall in diastolic blood pressure after imidapril was 22 mmHg after the first dose and 25 mmHg at steady state. Exploratory analysis of imidaprilat plasma concentrations vs. effect profiles suggests a hyperbolic concentration-response relationship in which single dose data contribute to the ascending portion of an Emax curve while maintaining the plateau around Emax at steady state.; In this group of hypertensive patients, the pharmacokinetic profile and the decrease in ACE activity and blood pressure observed after a single dose of imidapril and at steady state were similar. The initial response to a test dose could therefore predict the response during chronic dosing.",0,0

Whether pulse pressure amplification is modified by ACE inhibition, and whether changes in compliance and compliance are due to drug action on the arterial wall, to blood pressure lowering, or to a combination of both, is largely ignored. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we used the ACE inhibitor quinapril as a marker to assess changes in: pulse pressure gain (applanation tonometry), carotid compliance and compliance and compliance (echo tracking technique), and aortic compliance (measured from pulse wave velocity). . Quinapril reduced carotid and brachial pulse pressures to the same extent, causing the pulse pressure amplification to return to normal. The compliance and distensibility of the carotid and the distensibility of the aorta increased significantly. Based on a three-way analysis of variance, it was shown that while the changes in carotid stiffness were solely due to a reduction in blood pressure and not to drug relaxation of the arterial wall, the changes in aortic distensibility were due to the combination of both factors. Thus, using an atraumatic, non-invasive procedure, it has been shown that: (i) ACE inhibition is able to maintain pulse pressure amplification, an important factor contributing to the reduction of cardiac afterload; and (ii) ACE inhibition alters the hypertensive arterial wall in a very heterogeneous manner, with maximal drug effect on large muscular arteries such as the abdominal aorta and not on elastic arteries such as the carotid and thoracic aorta.",0,0

Trandolapril Multicenter Study Group.,,"Weir, M R; Saunders, E","The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril, a non-sulfhydryl prodrug that is hydrolyzed to trandolaprilat, was studied in 322 hypertensive African-American patients using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study design. After 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with placebo or 0.25 to 16 mg/day trandolapril, an analysis of drug effects on trough blood pressure (BP) was performed stratified by age, gender, weight, pre-treatment plasma renin activity, and trandolaprilat concentration accomplished. Two mg was the lowest effective dose of trandolapril, whereas doses above 4 mg did not significantly reduce trough levels. The decrease in blood pressure did not correlate with the plasma trough concentration of trandolaprilat. Pre-treatment plasma renin activity was not a reliable predictor of an antihypertensive response, since similar reductions in blood pressure occurred even in patients with the lowest levels of renin. There were no observable differences based on age, gender, or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis measurements. In conclusion, neither age, gender, nor plasma renin activity affected the antihypertensive response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in African Americans.",0,0

Drugs to be studied were administered 2-4 weeks after the start of AMI, and subjects were followed up for a median of 19 months. All patients received aspirin 50 mg/day. The endpoints of observation were cardiac events and non-cardiac events. Cardiac events included sudden cardiac death (SCD), death from heart failure, total cardiac death, and myocardial reinfarction.; The clinical conditions of the three groups were compatible. There were 66 cardiac events (6.0%). Compared to group C, the SCD rate in group A decreased significantly by 68% after 28 months of treatment with atenolol. Both atenolol and enalapril significantly increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), while in group C LVEF did not change during the follow-up period. There was an apparent downward trend in the survival curve in group C compared to the other two groups. Complete meds reduce a cardiac death by 0/00/month. But the rate of myocardial infarction was the same in all three groups. No serious side effects on blood pressure or heart rate were observed.; Both atenolol and enalapril (household products) are beneficial for the secondary prevention of SCD and death from heart failure after AMI, but not for re-infarction.

Treatment with spironolactone in combination with loop diuretics and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is reported to be useful in severe congestive heart failure (CHF). However, the effects of adding spironolactone on exercise performance and neurohormonal variables have not been established. This study determined the effects of supplemental spironolactone on exercise capacity and neurohormonal factors in patients with mild CHF. 2. Oxygen uptake (VO2), plasma norepinephrine (NE), renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II (AII), aldosterone (ALD), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were measured at rest and after maximal exercise in nine patients with CHF ( six idiopathic and three ischemic cardiomyopathy; New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II and III) already receiving furosemide (mean 29 +/- 5 mg/day) and enalapril (mean 4.7 +/- 0.8 mg/day ) took . The studies were repeated after 16 weeks of treatment with an additional single daily dose of spironolactone 25 mg. In four out of nine patients, the stress test was repeated after a 4-week washout with spironolactone. 3. Spironolactone treatment caused natriuresis, a decreased cardiothoracic ratio on chest X-ray (before vs. after treatment: 53.7 +/- 1.2 vs. 50.7 +/- 1.4%, P<0 .01) and an improved NYHA functional class. Maximum VO2 (17.1 +/- 1.6 vs. 17.5 +/- 2.2 mL/min/kg, NS) and heart rate and blood pressure responses to exercise were not changed.

The effect of imidaprilat on inhibition of the antihypertensive response to angiotensin I and augmentation of the antihypertensive response to bradykinin was compared to that of enalaprilat and captopril in anesthetized rats. To determine the incidence of cough associated with imidapril, patients with a history of ACE inhibitor-induced dry cough were enrolled in a randomized, open-label, crossover study of two 6-week courses of imidapril or amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker. Cough recurrence was assessed during both treatments. In the animal study, there were no significant differences in the ratio of inhibition of the antihypertensive response to angiotensin I and enhancement of the antihypertensive response to bradykinin among the ACE inhibitors. A total of 60 patients with hypertension were enrolled in the cough provocation study. Cough and cough-related symptoms recurred in 98.3% of patients (59/60) during imidapril therapy. In contrast, only two patients reported coughing during treatment with amlodipine.

Given the strong association of LV hypertrophy with cardiovascular risk, this study was designed to compare the effects of diuretic therapy and ACE inhibition on cardiac and vascular structure. Fifty essential hypertensive subjects (74% male, 88% non-white) participated in a double-blind study for 6 months and were randomly assigned to receive either ramipril or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Echocardiography, carotid ultrasound, and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring were performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after the start of therapy. The 22 ramipril patients were comparable to the 28 HCTZ patients at baseline for age, race and 24-hour blood pressure. Although HCTZ resulted in greater reductions in 24-hour blood pressure, only treatment with ramipril resulted in a decrease in LV mass (193 to 179 g, P<0.005, v 184 to 182 g, P=NS), indicating a reduction is attributable in wall thicknesses but not in chamber diameter. In the multivariate analysis, both the change in blood pressure and the treatment group were independent predictors of the change in LV mass. Importantly, although neither drug decreased the cross-sectional area of the carotid artery, relative wall thickness increased due to a tendency for vessel diameter to decrease and wall thickness to increase, particularly in the diuretic group. Ramipril caused a sustained decrease in plasma angiotensin II levels, while HCTZ increased angiotensin II levels. Although diuretic therapy was more effective in lowering ambulatory blood pressure in this predominantly non-white population, only ACE inhibition therapy was associated with LV mass regression. Vessel geometry was altered in unison with the reduction in dilatation pressure, resulting in vessel reconfiguration.",0,0

A review of its use in the treatment of essential hypertension.,,"Brogden, R N; Wiseman, L R","Moexipril is a prodrug that, after oral administration, is hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, moexiprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Moexipril 7.5 or 15 mg once daily is effective in lowering blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension (including elderly and postmenopausal women with this condition). In double-blind, randomized comparative studies, moexipril 7.5 to 15 mg once daily demonstrated similar efficacy to other antihypertensive drugs including captopril, hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, metoprolol, sustained release verapamil and nitrendipine. The combination therapy with hydrochlorothiazide and moexipril had a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either agent alone. Moexipril is well tolerated by the majority of patients and compares well with other antihypertensive drugs in this respect. Its safety profile appears to be characteristic of the ACE inhibitor class (the most common side effects are headache, symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection and cough). In general, moexipril had no clinically significant effect on lipid, glucose or electrolyte metabolism or haematological parameters and in particular was not associated with significant changes in lipid or glucose metabolism in postmenopausal women (with or without hormone replacement therapy); Once daily, moexipril is a useful agent for the treatment of essential hypertension that compares well with currently available options in terms of clinical efficacy and tolerability.

2380,9621290,Leucine turnover in patients with nephrotic syndrome: evidence suggesting body protein conservation.,,"Lim, V S; Wolfson, M; Yarasheski, K E; Flanigan, M J; Kopple, J D","Whole-body leucine flux was measured in eight patients with nephrotic syndrome and five healthy subjects by a primed constant infusion of L-[1-13C-leucine]. Plasma accumulation of 13C-leucine and 13C-alpha-ketoisocaproate (13C-KIC) was measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and expired 13CO2 was measured by isotopic ratio mass spectrometry. The kinetics of leucine calculated from the primary pool enrichment [13C-leucine] showed no difference between the nephrotic patients and the controls. However, kinetics derived from reciprocal pool [1-13C KIC] accumulation showed that leucine turnover rates were reduced in the nephrotic patients. The values (mumol/kg per hour, mean +/- SD) comparing patients and controls are as follows: rate of leucine release from protein degradation, 99 +/- 6 and 117 +/- 12 (P=0.007); leucine oxidation rate, 15 +/- 7 and 22 +/- 3 (P=0.04); rate of leucine incorporation into body protein [S], 84 +/- 10 and 95 +/- 6 (P=0.04); Protein turnover rate, 3.99 +/- 0.49 and 4.72 +/- 0.25 g/kg per day (P=0.007). Nitrogen balance, measured only in nephrotic patients, showed a mean positive balance of 0.5 g/day. In the nephrotic and control subjects, protein intake was 0.84 +/- 0.16 and 1.17 +/- 0.18 g/kg per day, respectively (P = 0.002) and energy intake was 33.3 +/- 8, 5 or 33.9 +/- 2.4 kcal/kg per day. Linear correlations between leucine turnover rates and protein intake were highly significant. This study found that nephrotic patients fed a mildly restricted diet were able to maintain positive nitrogen balance. In addition, leucine flux measurements revealed a down-regulation of protein degradation and amino acid oxidation, reflecting an appropriate adaptation to lower protein intake.",0,0

The proportional benefit was similar in patients with different baseline risk. The absolute benefit was particularly large in some high-risk groups (ie, Killip classes 2 to 3, heart rate > or = 100 bpm at entry) and in anterior MI. ACE inhibitor therapy also reduced the incidence of nonfatal heart failure (14.6% vs. 15.2%, 2P=0.01) but was associated with an excess of sustained hypotension (17.6% vs. 9.3 %, 2P<0.01) and renal impairment (1.3% vs 0.6%, 2P<0.01); These results support the early use of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, either in a broad patient population or selectively in patients with anterior myocardial infarction and those at increased risk of death.",0,0

Evaluation of losartan in the elderly study.,,"Aronow, W S","Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists inhibit the renin-angiotensin system more completely than ACE inhibitors and do not increase bradykinin levels like ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors have been shown to prolong survival and improve quality of life in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).

2386,9639376,Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase causes vasoconstriction of human resistance vessels in vivo.,,"Ferro, C J; Spratt, J C; Haynes, W G; Webb, D J","Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) degrades vasoactive peptides, including the natriuretic peptides, angiotensin II and endothelin-1. Systemic inhibition of NEP does not permanently lower blood pressure, although it increases natriuretic peptide levels and causes natriuresis and diuresis. We therefore examined the direct effects of local inhibition of NEP on forearm resistance vessel tone.; Four separate studies were conducted, each with 90-minute drug infusions. In the first study, 10 healthy volunteers received a brachial artery infusion of the NEP inhibitor candoxatrilat (125 nmol/min) that caused slowly progressive forearm vasoconstriction (12 +/- 2%; P=0.001). In a second two-phase study, 6 healthy volunteers received an intra-arterial infusion of the NEP inhibitor thiorphan (30 nmol/min) 4 hours after enalapril (20 mg) or placebo. Thiorphane caused similar local forearm vasoconstriction (P=0.6) after pretreatment with both placebo (13 +/- 1%, P=0.006) and enalapril (17 +/- 6%, P=0.05). In a third three-phase study, 8 healthy volunteers received intra-arterial thiorphan (30 nmol/min), the endothelin ETA antagonist BQ-123 (100 nmol/min), and both together. Thiorphan caused local forearm vasoconstriction (13 +/- 1%, P=0.0001); BQ-123 caused local vasodilation (33 +/- 3%, P=0.0001). The combination of thiorphan and BQ-123 caused vasodilation (32 +/- 1%, P=0.0001), similar to BQ-123 alone (P=0.98). In a fourth study, 6 hypertensive patients (blood pressure > 160/100 mm Hg) received intra-arterial thiorphan (30 nmol/min). Thiorphan caused slowly progressive forearm vasoconstriction (10 +/- 2%, P=0.0001).; Inhibition of local NEP causes vasoconstriction in the resistance vessels of the forearm in both healthy volunteers and hypertensive patients. The lack of effect of ACE inhibition on thiorphan-induced vasoconstriction and its absence during concomitant blockade of the ETA receptor suggest that it is mediated by endothelin-1 and not angiotensin II.

The presence of the structurally defined advanced glycation end product (AGE) pentosidine on tissue and circulating proteins has been correlated with the severity of diabetic complications.; To delineate the role of this AGE in diabetic nephropathy progression, glycohemoglobin and free and protein-bound pentosidine were measured in stored serum and urine of a subset of patients with diabetes mellitus and proteinuria at baseline, initially followed by the collaborative study group study. To delineate a potential role for an immune activation response to AGEs, the inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and the monocyte activation marker neopterin were also measured at baseline. The patients selected represented 67 subjects whose creatinine levels “doubled” over the course of the study, whether or not they were later treated with captopril, and 67 paired “non-doublers”; Baseline disease activity, as manifested by glycohemoglobin, serum creatinine, and the degree of proteinuria, was the same in both groups, as was protein-bound pentosidine and the immune markers IL-6 and CRP.

This is a 1-year prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group comparative study. Patients 25 to 75 years of age with uncontrolled hypertension with elevated diastolic blood pressure (> or = 95 mmHg) on three occasions (twice at the first visit and once only at the second and third visits) were recruited from a population survey. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 71 patients were randomized to doses of 5-10 mg amlodipine or 10-20 mg lisinopril, titrated based on effects on blood pressure. 59 patients completed the study period. Primary endpoints were left ventricular mass index and early to peak atrial filling velocity. Office and ambulatory blood pressure and other echocardiographic measurements were considered secondary. The drop in blood pressure was the same for both treatment regimens. A statistically significant decrease in left ventricular mass index was observed in both treatment groups: -11.0 g/m2 (95% CI: -6.0, -16.1) in the amlodipine group and -12.6 g/m2 (95 % CI: -8.2, -17.0) in the lisinopril group.

ACE inhibitors have been reported to be superior to most other antihypertensive drugs in inducing regression of LVH. In a double-blind, parallel-group study, 50 patients with essential hypertension were randomized to treatment with either fosinopril (20 mg once daily) or atenolol (50 mg once daily) for 12-16 weeks. Left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT, defined as the sum of the interventricular septum and posterior wall), diastolic function (represented by the ratio between the E wave and A wave of mitral blood flow), and femoral artery blood flow (FBF). evaluated by ultrasonic measurement. FBF was measured in normal insulinemia and after 2 hours of euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. Before treatment, the insulin-induced increase in FBF was inversely proportional to LVWT (r=-0.52, p<0.02). The reduction in 24-h ambulatory SBP/DBP was 13/9 mmHg for fosinopril and 15/14 for atenolol, with atenolol reducing ambulatory DBP significantly more (p=0.03 for difference in treatment effect). However, only treatment with fosinopril resulted in a significant reduction in LVWT (from 20.5 mm to 19.4 mm, p<0.05). The degree of reduction in LVWT was associated with the increase in FBF in the fosinopril group (r=-0.45, p<0.05). For fosinopril (but not for atenolol) there was a positive relationship between change in E/O ratio and change in femoral artery stroke volume (r=0.80, p<0.01); Impaired insulin-induced leg blood flow stimulation was associated with increased LVWT. Furthermore, during treatment with fosinopril, regression of LVWT was associated with improved skeletal muscle perfusion during hyperinsulinemia. This suggests that impaired peripheral blood flow (and thus increased afterload) could be a possible mechanism explaining the previously found association between insulin resistance and cardiovascular hypertrophy.",0,0

Both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been reported to increase vagal heart rate modulation and baroreflex sensitivity, but the relationships between the antihypertensive and vagal cardiac effects of these drugs in essential hypertension have remained unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of 4-week crossover monotherapy with metoprolol and ramipril on the spectral analysis indices of heart rate variability in supine and head-up tilted positions, baroreflex sensitivity (phenylephrine method) and 24-hour Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in 12 previously untreated patients with stage 1-2 essential hypertension. Compared to pre-treatment levels, both drugs reduced blood pressure similarly and significantly. However, the drugs had differential effects on cardiac vagal activity: metoprolol significantly increased mean RR interval, total RR interval, and supine high frequency variability and baroreflex sensitivity, but ramipril did not significantly affect these variables. The metoprolol-induced decrease in ambulatory blood pressure correlated with the prolongation of the RR interval and the increase in high-frequency variability in the supine position. The present data show that 4-week treatment with metoprolol increases tonic and reflex cardiac vagal activity, while ramipril does not affect cardiac vagal control in essential hypertension. An increase in vagal activity may contribute to the antihypertensive effect of metoprolol in patients with hypertension.",0,0

Left ventricular mass index and carotid artery distensibility were assessed by ultrasonography. Before medication, both baroreceptor sensitivity and heart rate variability correlated with carotid artery compliance but not with left ventricular mass index according to multiple regression analysis. The patients were then randomized into two groups, Derapril (n=18) and Manidipin (n=19) for 20 weeks. At the end of the study, change in baroreceptor sensitivity correlated with change in carotid artery compliance (r=0.41, P<0.05), but not with change in left ventricular mass index. Although derapril and manidipine reduced blood pressure and left ventricular mass index to the same extent, the former improved heart rate variability, baroreceptor sensitivity (5.0 +/- 1.9 --> 5.6 +/- 2.0 ms/mm Hg) and the distensibility of the carotid artery (2.1 +/- 0.8 --> 2.5 +/- 1.0 %kPa), but the latter did not improve it at all.

In Group B, 15 of 32 patients (46.9%) had abnormal UAE levels during the observation period, and these abnormal UAE levels remained unchanged; Seventeen of the 32 patients (53.1%) had abnormal UAE levels after an additional 6 months of continued CCB therapy. We conclude that long-term therapy with temocapril may provide renal protection by reducing AE even in hypertensive patients with no evidence of renal dysfunction.",0,0

Enalapril-Felodipine ER Factorial Study Group.",,"Gradman, A H; Cutler, N R; Davis, P J; Robbins, J A; Weiss, R J; Wood, B C; Michelson, E L","recent 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 3 x 4 factorial design demonstrated that enalapril-felodipine prolonged-release (ER) combinations had statistically significant additive effects in reducing sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) and sitting diastolic blood pressure ( SiDBP) and were generally well tolerated in hypertensive patients with SiDBPs in the 95 to 115 mm Hg range. The present open-label study was conducted to evaluate the long-term efficacy, tolerability and safety of such combinations. Patients from the factorial study were eligible for the 1-year open-label extension. Initially, all patients received enalapril 5 mg and felodipine ER 2.5 mg once daily; If SiDBP was not under control (< 90 mmHg) after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose was titrated up at 2 to 4 week intervals to a maximum of enalapril 10 mg-felodipine ER 10 mg. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg was added to the regimen of patients whose hypertension was not controlled on the highest dose of enalapril-felodipine ER. A total of 507 patients were enrolled, of which 502 were evaluable. At their last study visit, 391 (78%) of the evaluable patients received only enalapril-felodipine-ER combination. The enalapril-felodipine-ER combinations resulted in mean trough SiDBPs of 85 to 89 mm Hg (decrease of 13 to 16 mm Hg from baseline) and SiSBPs of 137 to 140 mm Hg (decrease of 13 to 21 mm Hg). Overall, 407 (81%) of the 502 evaluable patients achieved a SiDBP < 90 mm Hg or a reduction from baseline > or = 10 mm Hg (responders); such a response was observed in 331 patients (66%) taking a combination of enalapril-felodipine-ER alone and 76 patients (15%) taking the combination with 12.5 mg HCTZ added. Blood pressure reductions were sustained throughout the treatment period. Drug-related adverse events were relatively rare, often transient, usually mild, and did not appear to be dose-related. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse reactions were oedema/swelling, asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, cough and headache. These results suggest that enalapril-felodipine ER combination therapy is effective for long-term blood pressure reduction, has an excellent safety profile, and is generally well tolerated. The addition of low-dose HCTZ to the enalapril-felodipine-ER combination appears to allow further blood pressure control without increasing drug-related side effects.",0,0

Different pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models were compared. We assessed the strength of the association between baseline and laboratory physiological variables and the BP response as assessed directly by AUC(0.10h) and indirectly by the slope of the PK/PD relationship. Predictive models for response variables were developed using regression analysis.; The BP response was mainly related to plasma drug concentration. The association between the drop in blood pressure and baseline variables was weak. The strongest single predictor of BP response was mean baseline arterial pressure (r2 = 5.8%, P = 0.02). The best combinations of predictor variables included mean arterial pressure, plasma renin activity, creatinine concentration, and age (r2 = 14.4%, P = 0.37). When ACE inhibitor choice was added, the predictive power of the model increased (r=23.6%, p<0.01) but left most of the variability in response unexplained.; The blood pressure response at the first dose to ACE inhibition in patients with mild to moderate CHF cannot be accurately predicted from baseline pathophysiological variables. Choice of ACE inhibitor accounts for a small portion of the variability in response, but there is large inter-individual variability in response to each treatment.",0,0

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and echocardiographic determination of left ventricular mass index were performed in each patient at the end of a 4-week pre-treatment washout period, after 3 and 12 months of treatment with lisinopril or with lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide, and after a final 4-week placebo period . For each ambulatory blood pressure measurement, the 24-hour average, the daily average (06:00-24:00), the night-time average (24:00-06:00), and the day-night difference were calculated. The percentages of dipper and non-dipper patients (ie, patients with nocturnal falls in blood pressure greater than or less than 10% of the daily average) were also calculated.; The reproducibility of the day-night difference was low, both for the comparison of the pretreatment and the last placebo period (n = 170) and for the comparison of the third and the 12th month of treatment (n = 180). The reproducibility of the dipper-non-dipper dichotomy was also low, 35-40% of patients became non-dippers when they were dippers and vice versa, both with and without treatment significantly (P<0.01) with the changes in the 24-hour, diurnal, and nocturnal blood pressure (r always > 0.33) together, but this was not the case for the treatment-emergent change in day-night difference (r = -0.03 and -0.008 for systolic and diastolic, respectively blood pressure).; Our results show that day-night blood pressure changes and the classification of patients into dippers and non-dippers are poorly reproducible over time. It also provides the first prospective evidence that treatment-induced changes in day-night blood pressure difference are unrelated to treatment-induced regression in left ventricular mass index and therefore have limited clinical significance.",0,0
2405,9671045,Acute hyponatraemic encephalopathy after stroke.,,"Moussa, N A; Osman, A R; Yahya, T M","66-year-old hypertensive man with acute intracerebral hemorrhage developed an acute hyponatraemic coma 3 days after the addition of enalapril and a combination of amiloride and a thiazide diuretic to his hypotensive regimen. The patient regained consciousness and serum sodium normalized 2 days after fluid restriction and discontinuation of both drugs. Three weeks later, after accidental resumption of enalapril and indapamide, the severe hyponatraemic encephalopathy recurred immediately; Recovery was rapid again after fluid restriction and discontinuation of both medications. This temporal relationship accounts for the thiazide diuretic or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or both as the cause of the severe symptomatic hyponatraemia in this patient. The results of simultaneous serum and urine osmolality tests on several occasions were consistent with a decrease in free water clearance, either due to increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or potentiation of its peripheral effects and thiazide-induced natriuresis. The use of a thiazide diuretic in the presence of any of these abnormalities in ADH homeostasis most likely explains the profound and rapid development of hyponatremia. Drug-induced disturbances in serum osmolality are a potentially reversible cause of mental deterioration in an acute stroke patient.",0,0

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether antihypertensive drug therapy improves impaired endothelium-dependent renal vasorelaxation in patients with essential hypertension without atherosclerosis. We evaluated the effects of an intravenous infusion of L-arginine (500 mg/kg administered over 30 minutes) on systemic and renal hemodynamics in 27 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension randomized to treatment with any of the angiotensin converting enzyme Inhibitors imidapril were assigned or the calcium channel blocker amlodipine for 12 weeks in a double-blind manner. At 12 weeks, the fall in blood pressure was similar in the imidapril (n=14) and amlodipine (n=13) groups. The increase in renal plasma flow was also similar in both groups. L-arginine-induced renovascular relaxation was increased by imidapril (renal plasma flow, 9.6 +/- 5.1% to 14.4 +/- 7.4%; renal vascular resistance, -10.4 +/- 8, 1% to -16.7 +/- 9.2%, P<0.05), but not by amlodipine. Urinary excretion of nitrite/nitrate in response to L-arginine was significantly increased by imidapril (90 +/- 29% to 134 +/- 63%, P<0.05) but was unchanged by amlodipine. These findings suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition improves impaired endothelium-dependent renovascular relaxation in patients with essential hypertension due to the increase in nitric oxide production and that blood pressure lowering with a calcium antagonist does not play a major role in the potentiation of L-arginine /Nitric Oxide-mediated Effects.",0,0
2408,9679720,Effect of monotherapy on reducing left atrial size in mild to moderate hypertension: comparison of six antihypertensive agents.,,"Gottdiener, J S; Reda, D J; Williams, D W; Materson, B J; Cushman, W; Anderson, R J","The cardiac effects of hypertension include increased left ventricular (LV) mass and LV hypertrophy and increased left atrial size, a predictor of stroke and atrial fibrillation. Although the literature on reducing LV mass with antihypertensive therapy is extensive, little information is available on the effects of treatment on left atrial size.; In a double-blind study, patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 109 mm Hg) were randomized to treatment with atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, hydrochlorothiazide or prazosin. Two-dimensional M-mode directed echocardiography was used to assess left atrial size and LV mass at baseline, 8 weeks, and 1 and 2 years. The longitudinal analysis examined changes in left atrial size from baseline, statistically adjusted for age, race, pretreatment left atrial size, and LV mass, as well as serial measurements of systolic blood pressure, body weight, urinary sodium excretion, and the physical activity score. Without adjustment for covariates, only hydrochlorothiazide was associated with a reduction in left atrial size from baseline at 8 weeks (-1.0 +/- 5.2 mm; P = 0.052), 1 year (-2.0 +/- 5 .1 mm; P=0.02). and 2 years (4.6 +/- 7.2 mm; P=0.002). After accounting for the effects of covariates, patients with normal left atrial size had a greater reduction (-3.3 mm) in left atrial size with hydrochlorothiazide than with any other drug at 2 years. In patients with left atrial enlargement, left atrial size decreased significantly at 1 year with hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, clonidine, and diltiazem and at 2 years with all treatments. However, the reduction at 2 years was greater with hydrochlorothiazide than with captopril or prazosin.; Antihypertensive drugs differ in their effect on the size of the left atrium. Hydrochlorothiazide was associated with a greater overall reduction in left atrial size than other drugs effective to treat high blood pressure. The reduction in left atrial size with therapy is partially independent of factors known to affect left atrial size, including LV mass and reduction in LV mass with treatment. The clinical benefit of reducing left atrial size with antihypertensive treatment remains to be determined.",0,0

This study examined the effects of alacepril, a novel angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor containing sulfhydryls, on changes in neurohormonal factors during incline and on arterial baroreflex control of heart rate.; Plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, adrenaline, renin activity, angiotensin II, and atrial natriuretic peptide were determined in the supine position and after a 30-degree head tilt with measurements of central venous pressure and cardiac dimensions in seven patients with congestive heart failure (65 years, ejection fraction = 34%). . Arterial baroreflex control of heart rate was assessed by bolus phenylephrine. The arterial baroreflex test was re-examined 3 hours after oral administration of alacepril (37.5 mg). Tilt and arterial baroreflex tests were repeated 12 weeks after treatment with alacepril (50 mg x day(-1)).; Heart rate, blood pressure and neurohormonal factors did not differ before and after chronic alacepril, with the exception of a trend towards an increase in renin activity (2.0 vs. 4.9 ng x ml(-1) xh(-1)). Tilting the head up decreased central venous pressure (-2.5 mmHg) with a decrease in cardiac dimensions in the pre-alacepril phase. These changes were accompanied by increases in norepinephrine, adrenaline and angiotensin II and decreases in atrial natriuretic peptide. After chronic alacepril, the increase in norepinephrine tended to be smaller during head tilt (84 vs. 30 pg x ml(-1)), with similar changes in central venous pressure (-3.4 mmHg) and cardiac dimensions. Both acute (3.6 vs. 4.8 ms mmHg(-1)) and chronic (3.6 vs. 6.7 ms mmHg(-1)) treatment with alacepril showed a trend towards an increase in arterial baroreflex control associated with heart rate.; These results suggest that treatment with alacepril can lead to a reduction in sympathetic activation during orthostatic stress and improve arterial baroreflex function in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.",0,0

It is the largest database of its kind in the world, and about 35,000 new reports are added every quarter. The task of finding new drug ADR signals was undertaken by a panel of experts, but with such a large body of material the task is daunting. We have developed a flexible, automated procedure to find new signals with known probability differences from the background data.; Data mining, using various computational approaches, has been applied in a variety of disciplines. A Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) has been developed that can manage large datasets, is robust in handling incomplete data, and can be used with complex variables. Using information theory, such a tool is ideal for finding drug-ADR combinations with other variables that are strongly associated compared to the generality of the stored data or a subset of the stored data. The process is transparent for easy review and flexible for different types of searches.; Using the BCPNN, some time scan examples are given showing the power of the technique to find signals early (captopril cough) and avoid false positives when a common drug and ADRs are present in the database (digoxin acne; digoxin rash). . Routine application of the BCPNN to a quarterly update is also tested and shows that 1004 suspected drug-ADR combinations achieved the 97.5% confidence level of deviation from the general public. Of these, 307 were potentially serious ADRs and 53 were related to new drugs. Twelve of the latter were not included in the CD editions of The doctor's Desk Reference or Martindale's Extra Pharmacopoea, and did not appear in Reactions Weekly online.; The results demonstrate that the BCPNN can be used to detect significant signals from the WHO International Drug Control Program data set. The BCPNN will be an extremely useful adjunct to the expert assessment of a very large number of spontaneously reported ADRs.",0,0

This report examines whether the benefit of antihypertensive treatment varied by sex, prior cardiovascular complications, age, baseline blood pressure (BP), and smoking or drinking habits in an intention-to-treat analysis, and examines whether the morbidity and mortality outcomes were consistent in a per-protocol analysis.; After stratification by center, sex, and cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients aged 60 years or older with systolic blood pressure 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mm Hg were randomized. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day), with the possible addition of enalapril maleate (5-20 mg/day) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), titrated or combined to Reduce sitting systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mm Hg to below 150 mm Hg. Similarly matched placebo tablets were used in the control group.; In the intention-to-treat analysis, male gender, prior cardiovascular complications, older age, higher systolic blood pressure, and smoking at randomization were positively and independently correlated with cardiovascular risk. In addition, the benefit of antihypertensive drug treatment for all-cause (P=0.009) and cardiovascular (P=0.09) mortality diminished with increasing age; for all-cause mortality (p=0.05), the benefit increased with higher systolic blood pressure at entry, while it was most pronounced for fatal and nonfatal stroke (p=0.01) in non-smokers (92.5% of all patients). In the perprotocol analysis, active treatment reduced all-cause mortality by 24% (p=0.05), reduced all fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular endpoints by 32% (p<0.001), reduced all strokes by 44% (p=0.004) , reduced nonfatal stroke by 48% (p=0.005) and reduced all cardiac endpoints, including sudden death, by 26% (p=0.05).; In elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, stepwise antihypertensive drug treatment, beginning with the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nitrendipine, improves the prognosis.

2415,9704248,Comparative tolerance profile of hypertensive crisis treatments.,,"Grossman, E; Ironi, A N; Messerli, F H","Hypertensive crisis is defined as a severe increase in blood pressure and is classified as either urgent or emergency. In hypertensive urgency, there is no end-organ injury and no evidence that acute blood pressure lowering is beneficial. In fact, rapid uncontrolled depressurization can be harmful. Therefore, in hypertensive emergencies, blood pressure should be lowered gradually over 24 to 48 hours with oral antihypertensive drugs. If the cause of transient increases in blood pressure can be easily identified, appropriate treatment should be instituted. If the cause is unknown, an oral antihypertensive drug should be given. The effectiveness of the available treatments appears to be similar; However, the underlying pathophysiological and clinical findings, mechanism of action, and potential for side effects should guide the choice. Captopril should be avoided in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral renal artery stenosis in patients with solitary kidney. Nifedipine and other dihydropyridines increase heart rate, while clonidine, beta-blockers, and labetalol tend to decrease it. This is particularly important in patients with ischemic heart disease. Labetalol and beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with bronchospasm and bradycardia or heart blocks. Clonidine should be avoided if mental acuity is desired. In a hypertensive emergency, there is an imminent threat to the integrity of the cardiovascular system. Blood pressure should be lowered immediately to prevent further end-organ damage. Sodium nitroprusside is the most popular active ingredient. Nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) is preferably used in acute coronary insufficiency. A beta-blocker may be added in some patients. Loop diuretics, nitroglycerin, and sodium nitroprusside are effective in patients with concomitant pulmonary edema. Enalaprilat is also theoretically helpful, especially if the renin system could be activated. Initial treatment for aortic dissection includes rapid, controlled titration of arterial pressure to normal using intravenous sodium nitroprusside and a beta-blocker. If beta-blockers are contraindicated, urapidil or trimetaphancamsilate are alternatives. Hydralazine is the drug of choice for patients with eclampsia. Labetalol, urapidil, or calcium antagonists are possible alternatives when hydralazine fails or is contraindicated. In patients with catecholamine-induced crises, an alpha-blocker such as phentolamine should be given; Labetalol or sodium nitroprusside with beta blockers are alternatives. There are few, if any, comparative or randomized studies that provide definitive conclusions about the efficacy and safety of comparator drugs. Some researchers recommend lowering diastolic blood pressure to no lower than 100 to 110 mm Hg. A reasonable approach for most patients with hypertensive emergencies is to lower mean arterial pressure by 25% over the first 2 to 4 hours with the most specific antihypertensive regimen.",0,0

LV mass decreased (90 +/- 25 to 77 +/- 21 g/m2, p<0.0005) when LV end-diastolic volume increased (65 +/- 13 to 73 +/- 22 mL/m m2, p<0.01) . The global mass-to-volume ratio of the LV decreased from 1.40 +/- 0.28 to 1.08 +/- 0.18 g/mL (p<0.0001), as did the ratio of circumferential wall thickness to Volume of uninfarcted myocardium at the base of the LV (0.06 +/- 0.02 to 0.05 +/- 0.02 mm/mL, p<0.001). LV ejection fraction increased from 35 +/- 6 to 40 +/- 9% (p < 0.001) in the presence of an increase in calculated end-systolic wall tension (185 +/- 57 to 227 +/- 54 g/cm2 , p < 0 ,01).; ACE inhibitor therapy was associated with improved LV function in terms of a decrease in LV mass-to-volume ratio and a decrease in wall thickness-to-volume ratio of the uninfarcted myocardium. Whether ACE inhibitor therapy had a direct or indirect effect on these changes in LV mass and function is an open question that requires further investigation.",0,0

After a 4-week placebo run-in period, patients underwent two active treatment periods, each lasting 12 weeks, separated by a 4-week washout period. Sixty patients with supine diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 120 mm Hg were included, whether or not they had received prior antihypertensive medication. Amlodipine reduced systolic and diastolic clinical blood pressure in the supine position significantly more than lisinopril (-20+/-2/-14+/-1 vs. -11 3/-7+/-1 mmHg; P=0.02/P= 0.001) 24 h post-dose. Clinical diastolic blood pressure was also significantly reduced with amlodipine compared to lisinopril (p=0.05).

Randomized clinical trials in patients with CHD have provided convincing evidence that changing risk factors is beneficial in reducing all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The multifactorial reduction in coronary risk offers the greatest benefit. The reduction in coronary risk is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, a reduced need for myocardial revascularization procedures, and an improved quality of life for the patients so treated.

TROPHY study group.,,"Weir, M R; Reisin, E; Falkner, B; Hutchinson, H G; Sha, L; Tuck, M L","During a 12-week, multi-center study evaluating the efficacy and safety of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for the treatment of obesity-related hypertension, ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) measurements were performed in 124 patients at both baseline and study completion. Patients were randomized into three groups: placebo, lisinopril (10, 20, or 40 mg/day), or HCTZ (12.5, 25, or 50 mg/day). All groups were matched for sex, race, age, body mass index, and waist-to-hip ratio. The primary analysis of ABP data revealed that both lisinopril and HCTZ were effective in reducing 24-hour mean systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure compared to placebo (mean change from SBP/DBP at baseline: -12, 0/-8.2, -10.6). /-5.5 or -0.3/-0.5 mm Hg); however, lisinopril reduced DBP better than HCTZ (P<0.05). Secondary analyzes of groups showed that men responded better to lisinopril than HCTZ (-11.9/-7.3 vs. -6.6/-3.5 mmHg), while women responded well to both drugs. White patients responded better to lisinopril than to HCTZ, whereas black patients showed a significant response to HCTZ alone. Response to treatment was also affected by patient classification of 24-hour blood pressure profiles, ie, ""dipper"" or ""non-dipper."" Overall, most obese hypertensive subjects were non-dippers. Nondippers (n=82) responded well to both drugs (-10.4/-6.9 v -12.5/-5.7 mm Hg, P<0.05 v placebo), while Dippers (n=42 ) responded to lisinopril (-11.7/-9.4 mm Hg, P<0.05 v placebo and HCTZ) but not HCTZ (-5.6/-4.1 mm Hg, P=NS v placebo) . The results of the 24-hour ABP data indicate that both lisinopril and HCTZ are effective therapies for obesity-induced hypertension and that treatment response is influenced by gender, race, and Dipper/non-Dipper status.",0,0

On the first day of the switch, they underwent an ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM); Within 12 hours of the first dose, 31% of patients who switched to L had two consecutive systolic blood pressure readings 30 mmHg below their individual baseline, compared with 24% of patients who remained on C. Systolic blood pressure values less than 100 mmHg were recorded within 12 hours after the first dose in 3% of patients with L and in 6% of patients with C. The differences were not statistically significant. There were no clinical symptoms attributable to initial hypotension.

The EURODIAB Controlled Trial of Lisinopril in IDDM is a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 530 non-hypertensive, mainly normoalbuminuric IDDM patients aged 20 to 59 years. The albumin excretion rate (AER) was measured every 6 months for 2 years. The genotype distribution was 15% II, 58% ID and 27% DD. There were no differences in baseline characteristics or changes in blood pressure and glycemic control between genotypes throughout the study. There was a significant interaction between genotype groups II and DD and treatment when AER changed (P=0.05). Patients with genotype II showed the fastest rate of VRE progression on placebo but responded better to lisinopril. The AER at 2 years (adjusted for the AER at baseline) was 51.3% lower with lisinopril than with placebo in genotype II patients (95% CI, 15.7 to 71.8; P=0.01) , 14.8% in the ID group (-7.8 to 32.7; P=0.2) and 7.7% in the DD group (-36.6 to 37.6; P=0, 7).

Adverse interactions between aspirin and enalapril have been reported, presumably due to inhibition of ACE inhibitor-induced prostaglandin synthesis by aspirin. Ticlopidine is a potent antiplatelet agent with no interaction with prostaglandin synthesis.; The aim of this study was to compare the influence of concomitant administration of ticlopidine or aspirin on the hemodynamic effect of an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) in patients with chronic heart failure. Twenty patients with severe heart failure were enrolled in a double-blind comparative study and assigned ticlopidine (500 mg daily, 12 patients) or aspirin (325 mg daily, 8 patients). The hemodynamic evaluation was performed after 7 days of treatment every hour for 4 hours after an oral administration of 10 mg enalapril. Significant reductions in systemic vascular resistance were observed in the ticlopidine group, in contrast to no significant decrease in the aspirin group. A significant (P=0.03) temporal interaction between treatment and treatment indicated a significant drug interaction between aspirin and enalapril. Total pulmonary resistance decreased significantly in both groups, with no difference between patients receiving aspirin or ticlopidine.; Enalapril was more effective in reducing systemic vascular resistance when given in combination with ticlopidine than with aspirin. In contrast, the reduction in total pulmonary resistance is similar when enalapril is administered in combination with aspirin or ticlopidine. A negative aspirin-enalapril interaction on prostaglandin synthesis presumably alters vasodilation in systemic vessels, while prostaglandin-independent effects of ACE inhibition, such as B. a pulmonary arterial vasodilation maintained.",0,0

To determine whether individuals with EH have increased CE transport, isotopic CE transfer (CET) and lipoprotein lipid and phospholipid composition were estimated in a group of 14 untreated normolipidemias (triglycerides 116 +/- 46, Cholesterol 185 +/- 30, HDL 38) determined +/-10 mg/dl), otherwise healthy, ethnically diverse EH subjects.

However, difficulties in measuring kinin concentrations have heretofore precluded the detection of an indisputable change in plasma bradykinin concentrations in these diseases. By developing a reliable assay, we were able to monitor bradykinin levels during attacks and during remission in HA and AA and in one patient treated with an ACE inhibitor.; Liquid-phase extraction, high-performance liquid chromatography, and RIA were used to specifically measure plasma bradykinin concentrations in 22 patients with HA and 22 healthy volunteers with a similar age and sex distribution. Four patients with AA and one patient with hypertension treated with the ACE inhibitor captopril were also studied.; In healthy volunteers, plasma bradykinin concentration was inversely proportional to age. The geometric mean plasma bradykinin concentration in healthy subjects was 2.2 fmol/mL (SD 2.2) compared to 3.9 fmol/mL (3.7) in patients with HA in remission (p=0.095). Bradykinin was also high in patients with AA (10.4 fmol/mL [1.6]). During acute attacks of edema, plasma bradykinin increased two to twelve times the upper limit of normal in both HA and AA. Infusion of C1-esterase inhibitor (the deficiency factor in both HA and AA) immediately lowered bradykinin levels. In the patient receiving the ACE inhibitor captopril, bradykinin levels were very high at 47 fmol/mL during an acute attack of angioedema but normal at 3.2 fmol/mL in remission after drug cessation; A sensitive method for measuring bradykinin in plasma offered the opportunity to show that levels of this peptide decrease with age in healthy people.

Similarly matched placebos were used in the control group. Given ongoing concerns about the use of calcium channel blockers as first-line antihypertensive drugs, this review examined the extent to which nitrendipine, administered alone, prevented cardiovascular complications. The mean age at randomization was 70.2 years and the systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 173.8/85.5 mm Hg.

Compared to the entire placebo group (n=2297), patients receiving nitrendipine monotherapy had 25% (p=0.05) fewer cardiovascular endpoints, and those who crossed over to other active treatments showed overall decreases (p<0 ,01). Mortality (40%), stroke (59%) and all cardiovascular endpoints (39%). Of the control patients, 863 used only the first choice placebo. Compared to this subgroup, patients receiving nitrendipine monotherapy demonstrated an almost 50% (P<=0.004) reduction in all types of endpoints, including all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The full relative benefit of nitrendipine was observed as early as 6 months after randomization. To ensure that the benefit conferred by dihydropyridine was not due to selection bias, the 1327 patients remaining on nitrendipine monotherapy were matched for gender, age, prior cardiovascular complications and systolic blood pressure at entry with an equal number of placebo patients. In this analysis, nitrendipine (P<=0.05) reduced cardiovascular mortality by 41%, all cardiovascular endpoints by 33%, and fatal and nonfatal cardiac endpoints by 33%.

The changes in trough blood pressure at 3 and 12 months were closely correlated, as were the corresponding changes in peak blood pressure. However, the 3- and 12-month T/Ps correlated to a lesser extent (r < 0.42). Furthermore, treatment-induced reduction in LVMI was similarly correlated with treatment-induced reduction in 24-hour mean, trough, and peak blood pressure, but not with T/Ps. This was also evident when the contribution to LV hypertrophy regression by 24-hour BP changes and T/Ps was assessed in a multivariate regression analysis. In patients with a T/P >/= 0.5 or < 0.5, the regression of the LVMI was similar. In conclusion, changes in maximum and minimum blood pressure are reproducible and predict regression in treatment-induced LVMI and mean 24-hour blood pressure. T/Ps are less reproducible and their value does not predict regression of organ damage from antihypertensive treatment.",0,0

The available data do not definitively define the impact of atrial fibrillation on prognosis in heart failure.; A retrospective analysis of studies on the prevention and treatment of left ventricular dysfunction was performed, comparing patients with atrial fibrillation with those in sinus rhythm at baseline for the risk of all-cause mortality, progressive pump failure, and arrhythmic death.; Patients with atrial fibrillation at baseline had higher all-cause mortality (34% vs. 23%, p<0.001), deaths due to pump failure (16.7% vs. 9.4%, p<0.001) compared to patients with sinus rhythm. 0.001) and were more likely to meet the composite endpoint of death or hospitalization for heart failure (45% vs. 33%, p<0.001), but there was no significant difference between groups in arrhythmic deaths. After multivariate analysis, atrial fibrillation remained significantly associated with all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12 to 1.62, p=0.002), progressive death from pump failure (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.85, p=0.01), the composite endpoint of death or hospitalization for heart failure (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.42, p=0.02), but nonarrhythmic death (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.71). ;p=0.55).; The presence of atrial fibrillation in patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, which is largely explained by an increased risk of death from pump failure.

The calcium channel blocker (CCB) controversy over the past 3 years has prompted a natural experiment that allowed for an assessment of the impact of media reports, a national warning letter, a conference call, small group workshops and newsletters on first-line prescribing of antihypertensive drugs.; We included all physicians (4403) in British Columbia who had prescribed a thiazide diuretic, beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or CCB as the first antihypertensive drug for 36,507 residents 66 years and older without prior or concomitant use Signs of underlying cardiovascular disease. We used a database covering all prescriptions for the elderly to measure the change in the proportion of newly treated patients receiving each drug class as first-line therapy. We used a matched cohort design for the conference call and workshops assessment, a randomized community design for the newsletters, and a time-series analysis for media impact.; The proportion of patients receiving CCB as first-line therapy gradually decreased from 22% in early 1994 to 15% in late 1996. This proportion was unaffected by two waves of negative news about CCB in 1995, but decreased by 5% at 5 months and by 3% at 1 month after two waves in 1996. The proportion of patients who, contrary to guidelines, received either a CCB or an ACE inhibitor as first-line therapy was 42% in 1996.

After a 3-week placebo period, patients were treated with trandolapril 2 to 4 mg/day for 16 weeks. UAE and blood pressure (mercury sphygmomanometer and 24-h ABPM) were measured at baseline and repeated with trandolapril. Predictive factors for abnormal UAE (24-h UAE > or = 30 mg) were determined using univariate and multivariate analysis (logistic regression). It also looked for predictors of a UAE decline. One hundred and seventy-one patients entered the analysis. Baseline office BP was 164 +/- 14 / 97 +/- 6 mm Hg and 24 hour BP was 142 +/- 17 / 83 +/- 10 mm Hg. 74 patients (43%) had UAE > or = 30 mg. Independent risk factors for abnormal UAE were nocturnal diastolic blood pressure (odds ratio [OR] = 4.1, confidence interval [CI] = 2.0 to 8.6, P = 0.0001), duration of diabetes (OR = 2.4, CI = 1.1 to 5.0, P=0.025) and presence of retinopathy (OR=3.2, CI=1.0 to 10.0, P=0.047). Conversely, office blood pressure level was not significantly associated with UAE. During treatment, in-office blood pressure readings decreased to 143 +/- 13/82 +/- 8 mm Hg (P<0.0001) and 24-hour BP readings to 134 +/- 17/78 +/- 9mmHg (P<0.0001). .0001). In the abnormal UAE group, UAE decreased significantly from 76 to 50 mg/day (p=0.006). After treatment, the independent predictive factors for abnormal AE were: drug-treated fasting plasma glucose (OR = 3.5, CI = 1.7 to 7.4, P = 0.0009) and drug-treated diastolic blood pressure (OR = 3, 5, CI = 1.7 to 7.4). , P = 0.001). The only predictor of a decrease in UAE was a decrease in systolic blood pressure over 24 h (OR=2.3, CI=1.3 to 4.3, P=0.007). We conclude that in diabetic hypertensive patients with abnormal UAE, trandolapril exhibited a sustained antihypertensive effect over 24 hours and provided a consistent reduction in microalbuminuria.

Therefore, we conducted such a study in patients with non-diabetic kidney disease and proteinuria. After a 4-week washout period, during which patients were not taking any drugs known to affect proteinuria, 21 patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either the calcium channel blocker amlodipine (Amlo, 5 to 10 mg) or the ACE inhibitor Lisinopril (Lis, 5 to 10 mg). Blood pressure, creatinine clearance and proteinuria were measured every 2 weeks during the 16-week study period. In addition, device-measured blood pressure and renal hemodynamic studies were performed at baseline and at the end of the study. Systolic blood pressure fell from 163 +/- 7 (SEM) to 140 +/- 8 mm Hg (p < 0.01) in the Lis group and from 157 +/- 10 to 147 +/- 6 mm Hg in the Amlo Group ; diastolic blood pressure fell from 101 +/- 3 to 86 +/- 7 mm Hg in the Lis group and from 98 +/- 3 to 91 +/- 2 mm Hg in the Amlo group. Renal hemodynamics were unaffected by amlodipine treatment, while a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was observed in patients treated with lisinopril (from 55 +/- 11 to 50 +/- 10 mL/min; p<0, 01). Amlodipine did not significantly affect proteinuria. Lisinopril induced a decrease in the protein to creatinine ratio with a maximum effect reached after 12 to 16 weeks of therapy (from 0.39 +/- 0.17 to 0.26 +/- 0.11 g/mmol; p < 0.009). In summary, we could not demonstrate any antiproteinuric effect of the long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine, while therapy with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril led to a decrease in proteinuria. Amlodipine did not affect renal hemodynamics, while lisinopril caused a decrease in GFR.",0,0

A fixed, low-dose combination of these two active ingredients has been proposed for the treatment of high blood pressure. We evaluated this combination in 26 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and mild to severe chronic renal failure not requiring dialysis. This was a multicentre, open-label study consisting of a 2-week, single-blind, placebo washout period, followed by 12-weeks of active treatment. At week 0, patients received perindopril 2 mg/indapamide 0.625 mg once daily or every other day, with the option of dose adjustment to perindopril 4 mg/indapamide 1.25 mg at week 2, week 4, or week 8. A pharmacokinetic analysis using a population pharmacokinetic approach was performed at week 8. 23 patients completed the 12-week study. At this time, 14 patients received perindopril 2 mg/indapamide 0.625 mg daily, three received perindopril 2 mg/indapamide 0.625 mg daily and six received perindopril 4 mg/indapamide 1.25 mg daily. Blood pressure values (supine) decreased from 170.4 +/- 19.2 / 101.5 +/- 6.7 mm Hg before active treatment to 146.5 +/- 19.7 / 86.5 +/- 10.6 mm Hg at the end of treatment (p<0.0001). Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that for indapamide and perindoprilat (the active metabolite of perindopril), the area under the curve (AUC24) increased with the severity of renal impairment. No interaction was found between the two drugs. Mean serum creatinine and sodium and serum potassium levels remained stable throughout the study. One patient experienced renal impairment which was considered unrelated to treatment. We conclude that a low dose perindopril-indapamide fixed combination as first-line treatment has a good safety/efficacy ratio in hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure.",0,0

In chronic heart failure, the renin-angiotensin system is activated. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improves symptoms and prognosis. The aim of this study was to quantify and localize skeletal muscle ACE mRNA in patients with chronic heart failure and in control subjects and to elucidate skeletal muscle fiber area and capillary density.; Biopsies of the lateral vastus muscle were taken from 9 patients before and after treatment with enalapril and from 10 controls. ACE mRNA was quantified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize ACE in skeletal muscle. There was no difference in ACE mRNA transcripts between patients and controls, nor was ACE gene expression altered after treatment with enalapril. The number of ACE mRNA transcripts was related to muscle fiber area, while an inverse relationship was found between the number of ACE transcripts and capillary density. ACE has been detected in the endothelial cells of capillaries in skeletal muscle.; ACE is expressed in skeletal muscle and is restricted to endothelial cells. The close relationship between capillary density and the number of ACE transcripts indicates that activation of the renin-angiotensin system has an impact on capillary growth.",0,0

A matched normotensive control group was only studied under baseline conditions. Five of the hypertensive subjects were also studied in an open label pilot study after 3 months of treatment with captopril 25 mg twice daily. First, methacholine (MCh) but not SNP-induced vasodilation was significantly attenuated in the hypertensive patients compared to the normotensive controls (P<0.001 at MCh 4 micrograms/min). Second, although the two drugs induced a similar drop in blood pressure (-11 to 10 mm Hg/-8 to 7 mm Hg) one hour after dosing, captopril significantly enhanced the vasodilator response to MCh (+32 +/- 13%, MCh 4 micrograms/min, P<0.01) but not SNP, while nifedipine did not significantly alter the response to either MCh or SNP. The improvement in the captopril-induced vasodilator response to MCh was closely associated with the reduction in blood pressure (r=0.72, P<0.01). Third, in the pilot study, 3-month treatment with captopril induced a significant potentiation of the vasodilator response to MCh (+34 +/- 17%, MCh 4 micrograms/min, P<0.05) in parallel with a significant decrease in blood pressure (- 22+/-24/13+/-13 mm Hg, P<0.05), while the response to SNP was unchanged. In summary, the present study confirmed that essential hypertension is associated with a defect in EDP. In addition, improvement in EDV was observed in hypertensive patients shortly after administration of captopril but not nifedipine. In addition, in a small pilot study, a significant positive effect on EDV was observed during long-term treatment with captopril.",0,0
2445,9759987,The direct costs to the NHS of stopping and switching prescriptions for high blood pressure.,,"Hughes, D; McGuire, A","There is a lot of evidence that treating high blood pressure reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and is cost-effective for most patients. However, the effectiveness of treatment depends on compliance and maintenance of treatment. Each pharmacological agent differs in terms of side effects. The presence of side effects can lead to poor compliance and switching between treatments. A number of studies report high dropout rates for antihypertensive therapies. This may incur healthcare costs. The aim of this study is to use the MEDIPLUS data set to take into account the costs that arise from changing and stopping therapy. The analysis assesses resource costs related to additional GP visits and hospitalizations resulting from switching and dropping out of treatments. The total cost of hypertension has been estimated at around £76.5m per year, of which £26.9m is attributable to patients who switch or drop out of therapy.",0,0

Intraoperatively, increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 85 mmHg or > 80 mmHg during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were treated with a urapidil bolus. The intraoperative total amount of urapidil was documented for both groups. Systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics as well as the plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, arginine-vasopressin and renin were measured intraoperatively and up to 2 h after admission to the intensive care unit; Mean arterial pressure, cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance did not differ between the enalaprilat and control groups. Plasma renin levels increased significantly after enalaprilat infusion and did not change in the placebo group. Catecholamine and arginine vasopressin plasma levels increased significantly during CPB and remained high in the postoperative period with no differences between groups.

Fosinopril in the Heart Failure Study Investigators.,,"Zannad, F; Chati, Z; Guest, M; Plat, F","To investigate the efficacy and safety of fosinopril in the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF), patients with mild to moderate CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions < 40% were randomized and double-blinded to receive fosinopril 5 to 20 mg each day (n = 122) or enalapril 5 to 20 mg daily (n = 132) for 1 yr.; Event-free survival was longer (1.6 vs. 1.0 months, P=0.032) and the overall rate of hospitalizations plus deaths was lower with fosinopril than with enalapril (19.7% vs. 25.0%, P=0.028) . There were consistently better symptom improvements with fosinopril (P<0.05). The incidence of orthostatic hypotension was lower in the fosinopril group (1.6% vs. 7.6%, P<0.05); Fosinopril 5 to 20 mg daily was more effective in improving symptoms and delaying events associated with worsening CHF and produced less orthostatic hypotension than enalapril 5 to 20 mg daily.",1,1

The plasma concentrations of endothelin-1, angiotensin II, soluble thrombomodulin and soluble adhesion molecules (endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and granular membrane protein-140) were measured from arterial blood samples. All measurements were taken before the start of the infusion (""baseline"" values) and daily during the following 5 days. All endothelium-derived substances (thrombomodulin, endothelin-1 and all soluble adhesion molecules) were similarly elevated above normal in both groups. Endothelin-1 increased only in the untreated control patients (from 6.9 +/- 0.7 to 14.3 +/- 1.4 mg/ml). Soluble thrombomodulin increased in the untreated control patients (from 58 +/- 9 to 79 +/- 14 ng/ml [p<0.05]) but decreased significantly in the enalaprilat-treated patients. Soluble adhesion molecules increased in the untreated control group (leukocyte endothelial adhesion molecule from 92 +/- 14 to 192 +/- 29 ng/mL; intercellular adhesion molecule-1 from 480 +/- 110 to 850 +/- 119 ng/mL ) and returned to the enalaprilat patients almost to normal levels. The survival rate did not differ significantly between the two groups. Control patients developed severe sepsis and septic shock more frequently than the enalaprilat-treated group. The complex pathogenesis of endothelial functional abnormalities in sepsis potentially offers a large number of pharmacological interventions. Administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat resulted in reduced release of soluble endothelial-derived substances into the circulating blood, which may indicate improved endothelial function. The specific effects of enalaprilat on the endothelium need to be elucidated in further studies.",0,0

Twenty-eight mildly to moderately overweight [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >90 and <110 mm Hg] hypertensive subjects aged 43 to 64 years were randomized after a 4-week placebo period to receive perindopril 4 mg once daily or losartan 50 mg or, for 6 weeks. Then, after a new placebo period, the patients were switched to the alternative regimen for another 6 weeks. At the end of the placebo and treatment periods, blood pressure was measured, plasma fibrinogen was assessed, and insulin sensitivity was assessed by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. Glucose infusion rate (GIR) during the last 30 minutes of clamp and total glucose requirement (TGR) were assessed. Both perindopril and losartan reduced SBP (by a mean of 20.2 mm Hg, p<0.001 vs. placebo and 15.8 mm Hg, p=0.002 vs. placebo, respectively) and DBP (by a mean of 15.2 mm Hg, p=0.001). vs. placebo and 11.8 mm Hg, p=0.01 vs. placebo), with no difference between the two treatments. GIR was significantly increased by perindopril (+2.91 mg/min/kg, p=0.042 vs. placebo) but not by losartan (+0.28 mg/min/kg, NS). TGR was not altered by losartan but increased by perindopril (+9.3 g, p=0.042 vs. placebo). Plasma fibrinogen levels were reduced by perindopril (-53.4 mg/dl, p=0.022 vs. placebo) but not by losartan (-16.8 mg/dl, NS). The perindopril-induced decrease in fibrinogen correlated with the increase in GIR (r=0.39; p<0.01). These findings suggest that the fibrinogen decrease induced by the ACE inhibitor is related to its effect on insulin sensitivity, which does not appear to depend on angiotensin II blockade but rather on other mechanisms.",0,0
2458,9783490,Tailored antihypertensive treatment in the elderly.,,"Bonapace, S; Rajkumar, C; Bulpitt, C J","The treatment of hypertension in the elderly must take into account the pathology that is present at the same time.

Optimal use of antihypertensive treatment is considered in view of comorbidities; B. beta blockers or calcium channel blockers for angina pectoris and abstinence from diuretics for gout. Important dangerous drug interactions are also discussed. This suggests that diuretics remain the first choice and cheapest in uncomplicated hypertension.

PROGRESS Management Committee.,,,"The study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of lowering blood pressure (BP) in stroke prevention in patients with a history of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischemic attack.; A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicenter study of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril alone or in combination with the diuretic indapamide for the secondary prevention of stroke and other major cardiovascular events.; A total of 6,000 normotensive or hypertensive patients with a history of stroke or transient cerebral ischemia within the past 5 years will be enrolled in the study. The study will be conducted at over 160 centers in seven regions: Australia and New Zealand; People's Republic of China; France and Belgium; Italy; Japan; Sweden; and the UK. The primary study outcome is the total number of strokes, defined by the WHO criteria. Secondary endpoints include fatal and disabling stroke, total number of cardiovascular events and deaths, cognitive function, disability and dependence. A follow-up of at least 4 years is planned.; As of March 27, 1997, 173 local clinical centers were registered in seven regions. A total of 5268 patients (64% with a history of hypertension or baseline blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg [diastolic] or 160 mm Hg [systolic]) were randomized to active treatment or placebo. After 6 months of follow-up, the blood pressure difference between the treatment and control groups was 10.2/4.5 mmHg (systolic/diastolic). Sixty-three strokes (two fatal) and 20 myocardial infarctions (four fatal) were recorded.; The feasibility of the study is now assured as nearly 90% of the 6000 enrolled patients have been recruited. ACE therapy with perindopril is well tolerated in the population studied. The BP differences between control and treatment groups and the event rates recorded to date indicate that the study will meet its primary objectives.",0,0

No patient had previously received antihypertensive drugs prior to the start of this study. After a 2-week follow-up period, we performed ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) in 86 patients with essential hypertension (WHO stage I or II). Patients were then given a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACEI) inhibitor (captopril or imidapril), a beta-blocker (arotinolol or bisoprolol), or a calcium channel blocker (nisoldipine or benidipine) twice daily to control blood pressure. We assessed patients' blood pressure once every 2 weeks to ensure optimal control. After 12 weeks, the ultradian and circadian fluctuations in blood pressure were analyzed using the maximum entropy method (MEM). All antihypertensive drugs reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), 24-hour SBP, and 24-hour DBP. ACEI did not change office, 24-hour, day, or night heart rate (PR). Arotinolol and bisoprolol decreased 24-h PR. All antihypertensive drugs decreased the 24-hour, diurnal, and nocturnal pressure rate product. MEM showed that no antihypertensive agent affected the circadian variation of the 1st peak (24 hour periodicity) of SBP, DBP or PR. However, calcium channel blockers shortened the periodicity of the circadian fluctuations in the 2nd peak (12-hour periodicity) of SBP and in the 3rd peak (8- to 6-hour periodicity) of SBP. Therefore, ultradian fluctuations in blood pressure should be carefully monitored in hypertensive patients treated with calcium channel blockers.",0,0

Factors that may be responsible for the large interindividual variability in the antiproteinuric effect (APE) have not been investigated in renal transplant patients.; Twenty-eight patients after RTx with persistent proteinuria greater than 1.25 g/day were prospectively treated with doses of fosinopril (10-15 mg/day) that were ineffective on systemic arterial blood pressure. Before starting treatment with fosinopril, all patients underwent renal graft biopsy and duplex ultrasound ruled out renal graft artery stenosis. Serum creatinine and proteinuria were measured before and 3 and 8 months after the start of ACE inhibition, the mean arterial pressure was monitored using 24-h measurements and repeated point measurements. Reductions in proteinuria were correlated with renal histology, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, mean arterial blood pressure, pre-therapy sodium excretion, and relative changes in these parameters during therapy.; In 8/28 patients, therapy had to be discontinued due to side effects including increases in serum creatinine (n = 4). Three patients were excluded for non-compliance. In the remaining patients (n = 17), the proteinuria was reduced from 2.94 +/- 1.66 to 1.82 +/- 1.39 or 2.48 +/- 3.05 g/d after 3 or 8 months reduced, mean +/- standard deviation. There was a significant inverse correlation between the APE and the extent of benign nephrosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. No correlation of the APE with any of the other parameters could be demonstrated.; Fosinopril can be administered effectively in a subset of proteinuric kidney transplant recipients. However, since side effects occur in a high proportion of patients, careful monitoring is mandatory. Our results show that the lower the degree of chronic morphological damage, the greater the antiproteinuric effect. Thus, the degree of pre-existing histologically proven damage to the transplant can serve as an indicator for the antiproteinuric effectiveness of an ACE inhibitor therapy after RTx.",0,0

Efficacy of ramipril in nephropathy.,,"Ruggenenti, P; Perna, A; Gherardi, G; Gaspari, F; Benini, R; Remuzzi, G","The Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) study found that in patients with chronic nephropathies and proteinuria of 3 g or more per 24 h, ramipril safely reduced the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and halved the combined risk of serum creatinine or End-stage renal failure (ESRF) versus placebo plus conventional antihypertensive drugs with equal blood pressure control. At the end of the core study, patients continued on or switched to ramipril and were formally enrolled in the follow-up REIN study.; 97 patients participated in the follow-up study. Patients originally randomized to receive ramipril continued treatment at the same daily dose (n=51), while those originally randomized to placebo plus conventional antihypertensive drugs switched to ramipril after the first follow-up study visit (n=46). Ramipril (1.25 to 5.00 mg/day) and conventional antihypertensive therapy were aimed at achieving diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. The main efficacy variables were GFR decrease and ESRF (requirement for dialysis). The analysis was intended to treat.; During the follow-up study, the mean rate of GFR decline per month decreased from 0.44 (SD 0.54) mL/min per 1.73 m2 in the core study to 0.10 (0.50) mL/min per 1.73 m2 in patients originally randomized to ramipril (S=0.017) and from 0.81 (1.12) to 0.14 (0.87) ml/min per 1.73 m2 in those originally randomized to placebo plus conventional received antihypertensive therapy (p=0.017). At the last visit, the mean absolute GFR values in patients randomized to ramipril were 12 mL/min per 1.73 m2 higher (33% better) than in patients randomized to placebo (n=26 and 17, respectively: 35.5 [19.0] vs. 23.8 [9.4 ] ml/min per 1.73 m2, p=0.01). Nineteen of the patients initially treated with ramipril compared to 35 patients who switched from placebo to ramipril developed into ESRF throughout the observation period (p=0.027); of these, six (8%) versus 14 (16%) met this endpoint during the follow-up study; and the risk ratios were 1.86 (95% CI 1.07-3.26) throughout the observation period and 2.95 (1.13-7.68) during follow-up. Beyond follow-up at month 36, ESRF incidence was zero in patients originally randomized to ramipril but 30% in patients who received placebo plus conventional antihypertensive therapy.; In patients with chronic nephropathy and at high risk of rapid progression to ESRF, ramipril reversed the tendency of GFR to decrease over time. In addition, a treatment duration of sufficient duration (> or = 36 months) eliminated the need for dialysis. Even patients previously treated with other blood pressure lowering drugs than angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors benefited from switching to ramipril.",0,0
2464,9788828,Improved exercise tolerance after losartan and enalapril in heart failure: correlation with changes in myosin heavy chain composition in skeletal muscle.,,"Vescovo, G; Dalla Libera, L; Serafini, F; Leprotti, C; Facchin, L; Volterrani, M; Ceconi, C; Ambrosio, G B","In congestive heart failure, fatigue-resistant, oxidative, slow type I fibers in the leg skeletal muscles are reduced, contributing to limitation in exercise capacity (EC). The mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors and AII antagonists improve EC are still unclear. We tested the hypothesis that improvement in EC is associated with changes in skeletal muscle composition toward Type I fibers.; Eight patients with NYHA Class I-IV congestive heart failure were treated with enalapril (E) 20 mg/day and another 8 with losartan (L) 50 mg/day for 6 months. EC was assessed with maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests at baseline and after treatment. Gastrocnemius heavy chain myosin (MHC) composition was examined after electrophoretic separation of slow MHC1, fast oxidative MHC2a, and fast glycolytic MHC2b isoforms from needle microbiopsies obtained at baseline and after 6 months. The EC improved in both groups. Peak V(O2) increased from 21.0 +/- 4.7 to 27.6 +/- 4.3 ml. kg-1 . min -1 (P = 0.011) in the L group and from 17.5 +/- 5.0 to 25.0 +/- 5.5 ml. kg-1 . min -1 (P=0.014) in the E group. Similarly, the respiratory threshold changed from 15.0 +/- 4.0 to 19.9 +/- 4.9 mL (P = 0.049) with L and from 12.0 +/- 1.9 to 15.4 +/- 3.5 mL (P = 0.039) with E. MCH1 increased from 61.2 +/- 11.2% to 75.4 +/- 7.6% with L (P = 0.012) and from 60, 6 +/- 13.1% to 80.1 +/- 10.9% (P = 0.006) with E. Similarly, MHC2a decreased from 21.20 +/- 9.5% to 12.9 +/- - 4.4% (P=0.05) with L and from 19.9 +/- 7.8% to 11.8 +/- 7.9% (P=0.06) with E. MHC2b changed from 17.5+/-6.5% to 11.7+/-5.2% (P=0.07) with L and from 19.5+/-6.4% to 8.1+/-4 .6% (P=0.0015) with E. There was a significant correlation between net changes in MHC1 and absolute changes in peak V(O2) (r2 = 0.29, P = 0.029) and a trend towards significance for MHC2a and 2b.; Six months of treatment with L and with E leads to an improvement in EC of a similar magnitude. These changes are accompanied by a shift in leg skeletal muscle MHCs toward the slower, more fatigue-resistant isoforms. The magnitude of MHC1 changes correlates with the net peak V(O2) gain, suggesting that improved EC may be caused by favorable biochemical changes occurring in skeletal muscle.",0,0

The patients had been taking digoxin, furosemide, captopril, and aspirin for more than 3 months. Thirteen healthy subjects (mean age 50 +/- 4.0 years) served as controls. The compliance of the proximal (aorta and main branches, C1) and distal portions (C2) of the circuit was derived from a modified four-element third-order Windkessel model capable of reproducing arterial pressure waveforms, including both exponential and oscillatory sections. Active levels of renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone were determined in venous blood samples in the supine position and after 30 min of active standing. In the chronic heart failure patients, proximal (C1, 1.51 +/- 0.11 mL x mmHg(-1), P<0.01) and distal (C2, 0.050 +/- 0.011 mL x mmHg(- 1)) reduced arterial compliance vs controls (C1, 1.71 +/- 0.16 mL x mmHg(-1); C2, 0.054 +/- 0.006 mL x mmHg(-1)). The chronic heart failure patients were characterized by an aldosterone escape phenomenon that was inversely correlated with proximal arterial compliance in both the supine (r = -0.795, P = 0.002) and standing (r = -0.628, P = 0.029) positions .; In chronic heart failure patients treated with complete angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and diuretics, there is decreased compliance of the aorta and its main branches, which inversely correlates with the aldosterone escape phenomenon.",0,0

2467,9793603,Losartan as an alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients with renal impairment.,,"Esmail, Z N; Loewen, P S","Losartan-induced acute renal failure may occur in patients sensitive to reduced renal plasma flow. These patients include patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis, severe congestive heart failure, and severe sodium and volume depletion because their renal function is often angiotensin-dependent. In theory, both ACE inhibitors and losartan could impair kidney function in such sensitive patients. The ELITE study demonstrated a 10.5% incidence of losartan-induced renal dysfunction in elderly patients with congestive heart failure with no known underlying renal dysfunction, an incidence identical to that for captopril. A review of the literature identified no controlled trials specifically addressing the use of losartan as an alternative in patients with published renal dysfunction associated with losartan, and one additional case report from a local adverse event surveillance program was identified Drug effects identified. There have been two cases of patients who developed kidney dysfunction while receiving ACE inhibitors and then losartan. We found only one published case of losartan being used without deterioration in renal function in patients who developed renal dysfunction while taking an ACE inhibitor, although such cases would be expected to be under-reported. There was one case of renal dysfunction with losartan after a lack of renal dysfunction while the patient was taking an ACE inhibitor. The remaining three reports relate to patients who developed renal dysfunction while taking losartan without prior use of ACE inhibitors. All case reports describe deterioration in renal function that was reversible upon discontinuation of the causative agent, be it an ACE inhibitor or losartan. All but two patients (personal communication, Barbara Cadario) had underlying renal pathology. Although there is little published literature and some clinical experience suggests otherwise, there is currently no evidence (with the exception of 1 case report) that losartan is better tolerated than ACE inhibitors in terms of renal toxicity. Available evidence suggests that this applies equally to patients with and without underlying renal dysfunction. In addition, case reports suggest that losartan, like ACE inhibitors, should be avoided in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis and in patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney. Losartan can be given to patients with underlying renal impairment, whether or not they are ACE inhibitor-tolerant, if considered necessary. Renal function should be monitored and losartan should be discontinued if signs of renal dysfunction appear, as several case reports and one randomized study suggest that losartan may have the same adverse renal effects as ACE inhibitors.",0,0

Investigators of the candesartan cilexetil study.,,"Reif, M; White, W B; Fagan, T C; Oparil, S; Flanagan, T L; Edwards, D T; Cushing, D J; Michelson, E L","The objectives of this double-blind, multicenter, randomized, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled study were to evaluate the dose-related efficacy, tolerability, and safety of candesartan cilexetil, a potent, AT1-selective, long-acting angiotensin II receptor blocker, in 365 adult patients with systemic hypertension and one moderate seated diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 95 to 114 mm Hg. Patients received either placebo or candesartan cilexetil 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 mg once daily for 8 weeks. All candesartan cilexetil doses significantly reduced seated trough diastolic and systolic blood pressure (24 hours post-treatment) compared to placebo (p<0.005). A significant (p< or = 0.0001) dose-response was evident, with greater decreases in blood pressure at higher doses. Mean blood pressure changes were -10.7/-7.8 mm Hg and -12.6/-10.2 mm Hg in the 16 and 32 mg groups, respectively, versus -0.3/-2.6 mm Hg in the placebo group. The 16 and 32 mg doses were consistently significantly superior to placebo in terms of antihypertensive effect on all blood pressure measurements, including peak (6 hours after treatment), trough, sitting and standing measurements of diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Response rates (seated diastolic blood pressure < 90 or > or = 10 mmHg drop in blood pressure) were 54% and 64% for the 16 and 32 mg groups, respectively. Tolerability and safety profiles were similar to placebo at all doses. In summary, candesartan cilexetil administered once daily is effective in lowering blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner while maintaining safety and tolerability. Doses of 16 and 32 mg are most effective for treating high blood pressure.",0,0

Blood pressure inclusion criteria were diastolic blood pressure 90–115 mmHg and systolic blood pressure < or = 200 mmHg while subjects were off antihypertensive medication for 3 weeks.; Patients were randomly assigned to nitrendipine (n=40), enalapril (n=40), or placebo (n=41). The duration of treatment was 48 weeks.; The effect of nitrendipine was defined as the difference in change from baseline in left ventricular mass index between nitrendipine and placebo treatment after 48 weeks of treatment. The effects of nitrendipine compared to enalapril and of enalapril compared to placebo were defined similarly. Left ventricular mass was measured by M-mode echocardiography.; The use of nitrendipine and enalapril resulted in a significant and almost identical reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. During 48 weeks, left ventricular mass index decreased by 5% in patients in the nitrendipine group (decrease of 12 g/m2, 95% confidence interval 1-23), remained about the same in patients in the enalapril group (decrease of 1 g/m2, m2, 95% confidence interval decrease of 10 to increase of 9) and increase of 9% for patients in the placebo group (increase of 9 g/m2, 95% confidence interval 2-16); These results demonstrate that administration of nitrendipine to patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension reduces left ventricular mass index. Enalapril does not appear to induce regression but may prevent progression with an effect intermediate between that of nitrendipine and placebo.",0,0

A centralized review committee has validated a sample echocardiogram from the preliminary study from each center and is now reviewing all videotapes recorded during this study for quality control; final results are based on further randomized blinded analysis by this centralized review board.; Since December 1994, 878 patients have been preselected (videoechocardiography recordings sent for review), 645 selected (videoechocardiography recordings validated), and 576 randomly assigned to treatment. After a preliminary quality control, 27% (233) of the baseline echocardiograms were rejected by our centralized review committee, and 22% (142) of the post-enrollment echocardiographic measurements had to be repeated, mainly because they were of poor echogenic quality. Analysis of the admitted baseline echocardiograms for the first 274 randomly assigned patients with digitized data showed that there was a significant correlation between the centralized review committee calculations and the investigators' left ventricular mass index (r=0.76, P<0.001), with consistently higher values for the investigators' calculations, regardless of the level of left ventricular mass index (correlation between difference and mean of investigator and centralized review committee measurements, r=0.08, P=0.28). The mean difference was 8 +/- 20 g/m2 (P<0.001).; Early quality control results of the LIVE study indicated that centralized real-time “live” echocardiographic reading was not only feasible, but useful in avoiding unquantifiable echocardiograms and left ventricular mass index overestimation.

Normal and ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure (24hBP) was reduced in the captopril group from 163/95 to 144/83 mmHg and 152/86 to 145/81 mmHg and from 160/93 to 145/86 mmHg and 156/86 to 147/79 mm Hg in the doxazosin group (all P<0.05). The 24 hBP achieved under treatment was positively associated with pre-treatment levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and atrial natriuretic plasma peptide (r=0.53 and 0.59, respectively, both p<0.01). Albuminuria did not change significantly in either group. Left ventricular hypertrophy was present in 13 patients (7 in the captopril and 6 in the doxazosin group). Left ventricular mass was reduced by an average of 27% and 23% in these patients, respectively (both p<0.01), but did not change significantly in patients without left ventricular hypertrophy. The reduction in left ventricular mass was positively associated with the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline and inversely with dietary sodium intake and resulted in occasional blood pressure during treatment (R2 = 0.59, P<0.001). We conclude that doxazosin and captopril administered for 6 months are equally effective in reducing blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive type 1 diabetics; the antihypertensive effect is closely related to glycemic control; and dietary sodium intake and achieved post-treatment blood pressure are independent determinants of the reduction in left ventricular mass observed in these patients.",0,0

During the first month of treatment, sexual activity, measured as the number of intercourse episodes per month, increased with both atenolol (from 7.8 +/- 4.3 to 4.5 +/- 2.8, P < 0.01 v placebo) as well as with lisinopril (from 0.01 v placebo) significantly from 7.1 +/- 4.0 to 5.0 +/- 2.5, P < 0.05 v placebo). As treatment continued, sexual activity tended to recover in the lisinopril group (7.7 +/- 4.0 intercourse episodes per month, P = NS vs. placebo), but not in the atenolol group (4.2 + /- 2.8, P<0.01 v placebo), with a statistically significant difference between the two drugs (P<0.01). The percentage of patients reporting symptoms of sexual dysfunction was significantly higher in the atenolol-treated group than in the lisinopril-treated group (17% vs. 3%, p<0.05).

Elderly patients with heart failure are routinely treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which can increase the risk of kidney dysfunction. We examined the incidence of renovascular disease in elderly people with heart failure.; From the local population of Salford, UK, we recruited 86 heart failure patients with a mean age of 77.5 (SD 5.6) years who were admitted as acute emergencies or attending general medical clinics. We selected the patients based on the intention to treat them with ACE inhibitors. We used captopril renography to screen for renovascular disease. All patients with abnormal renograms underwent renal artery magnetic resonance angiography, as did 40% of patients with normal renograms as negative controls.; Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated severe renovascular disease (>50% renal artery stenosis or occlusion) in 29 (34%) patients. Captopril renography had an estimated sensitivity of 78.8% (95% CI 72.7-97.8) and specificity of 94.3% (67.6-97.3) for detecting renovascular disease. The estimated positive predictive value of captopril renography was 89.7% and negative predictive value was 87.5%.

However, the effects of a combined treatment strategy with invasive revascularization and subsequent long-term ACE-I therapy in patients with limiting angina pectoris and impaired left ventricular function have not been investigated to date. APRES is a long-term, prospective, randomized, double-blind study evaluating the effects of ramipril 10 mg od on the long-term development of cardiac events, left ventricular function, functional status, and quality of life after invasive revascularization in patients with no recent treatment for AMI or clinical heart failure and with a preoperative ejection fraction in the range of 0.30-0.50. The rationale, design, and performance of APRES, and the selection and relevance of outcome measures are discussed. Based on experience and results from the first year of the study in terms of screening procedures, enrollment rate, patient compliance, reproducibility analyzes and extent of outcome measurements, we conclude that the study is feasible and safe.

The Vascular Dementia project, set up as part of the double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur), investigated whether antihypertensive drug treatment could reduce the incidence of dementia.; Eligible patients were free of dementia, were at least 60 years of age, and had sitting blood pressures of 160-219 mm Hg systolic and less than 95 mm Hg diastolic. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), or both drugs, titrated or combined to reduce systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mm Hg in order to reach a value below 150 mm Hg. Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). If the MMSE score was 23 or less, diagnostic tests for dementia were performed (DSM-III-R criteria). The cause of dementia was determined by the modified ischemic score with brain imaging or the Hachinski score.; The median follow-up after intention to treat was 2.0 years. Compared to placebo (n=1180), active treatment (n=1238) reduced the incidence of dementia by 50% from 7.7 to 3.8 cases per 1000 patient-years (21 vs. 11 patients, p=0.05). The median MMSE score at randomization was 29 in both treatment groups. At the latest available assessment, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 8.3 mm Hg and 3.8 mm Hg lower in the actively treated group, respectively (p<0.001), but on average the MMSE scores did not change in either group.

A possible association between calcium channel blocker use and cancer incidence and mortality was investigated using data from the Nurses' Health Study.; In this study, a total of 18,635 female nurses reported regularly taking at least 1 of 4 cardiovascular medications during 1988: diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Cancer incidence and cancer deaths were collected up to 1994.; During the 6-year follow-up, 852 women were newly diagnosed with cancer and 335 women died from cancer. Women who reported calcium channel blocker use had no increased risk of being newly diagnosed with cancer compared to women using other cardiovascular drugs (relative risk = 1.02; 95% CI 0.83-1.26) . The relative risk of dying from cancer associated with self-reported use of calcium channel blockers was 1.25 (95% CI 0.91-1.72).

The effects of dihydropyridine CCB on 24-hour urinary protein excretion rate and GFR decrease (deltaGFR) were prospectively evaluated in 117 non-diabetic patients with chronic proteinuric nephropathy who were enrolled and randomized into the ramipril nephropathy efficacy study assigned to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEI) inhibition. or placebo plus conventional antihypertensive therapy. 63% of the patients were treated with dihydropyridine CCB. During follow-up, CCB-treated patients had higher proteinuria compared to patients without CCB (mean +/- SEM: 4.8 +/- 0.2 g/24 h versus 4.2 +/- 0.2 g/24 h, P=0.015) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). The difference in proteinuria was significant in the placebo group (5.1 +/- 0.2 g/24 h versus 4.3 +/- 0.3 g/24 h, P = 0.02), but not in the ACEI group (4.4 +/- 0.2 g/24 h versus 4.1 +/- 0.2 g/24 h). Notably, the CCB-treated patients in the ACEI group had significantly less proteinuria (p=0.028) compared to placebo. Patients with CCB treatment compared to patients without CCB had faster deltaGFR in the overall study population and in the placebo group but not in the ramipril group. Proteinuria was comparable at MAP < or = 100 mmHg in CCB-treated and non-CCB patients, but was higher at MAP > 100 mmHg in CCB-treated patients. Similarly, proteinuria was comparable in the placebo and ACEI groups for MAP < or = 100 mmHg but was higher in the placebo group for MAP > 100 mmHg. A linear correlation (P=0.006 for both groups) was found between proteinuria and MAP values in CCB- and placebo-treated patients. MAP, proteinuria, and deltaGFR in patients receiving nifedipine were comparable to those receiving other dihydropyridine CCBs. Therefore, in nondiabetic proteinuric nephropathies, dihydropyridine CCB may have an adverse effect on renal protein processing that depends on the severity of hypertension and is minimized by ACEI therapy or strict blood pressure control. ACE inhibitors may electively limit proteinuria in patients on dihydropyridine-CCB treatment and/or with uncontrolled hypertension.",0,0

For this reason, recent attention has focused on calcium antagonists or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. While these agents lower blood pressure, outcome data from large randomized trials are lacking, but some case-control data, dominated by short-acting dihydropyridines, suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular events. These studies had methodological limitations and did not distinguish between calcium channel blocker types and formulations. Several studies distinguishing between types of calcium antagonists and a review of published randomized studies show no increased risk with verapamil and suggest a benefit in CAD patients.; A total of 27,000 CHD patients with hypertension will be randomized at 1,500 primary care centers to receive either a calcium channel blocker (verapamil) or a beta-blocker/diuretic-based (atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide) antihypertensive treatment strategy. The study uses a novel, electronic ""paperless"" system for direct on-screen data entry, randomization and drug distribution from a mail-order pharmacy connected to the coordination center via the Internet.; Contract negotiations with the USA and international locations are ongoing. The patients included were predominantly elderly (72% aged 60 years or older) males (54%) with either an abnormal coronary angiogram or a previous myocardial infarction (71%). In addition to hypertension, CHD, and aging, most patients (89%) have one or more comorbidities (diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, cerebral or peripheral vascular disease, etc.) that contribute to an increased risk of adverse outcomes. While 26% have diabetes, most are not insulin dependent. Using protocol strategies, goal blood pressures (per JNC VI) were met at the fourth visit in 58% and, as expected, most (89%) require multiple antihypertensive drugs.; The design and baseline characteristics of the first patients recruited for a prospective, randomized, international, multicenter study comparing two therapeutic strategies to control hypertension in CAD patients are described.",0,0

All patients responded to enalapril with significant decreases in Hb, Ht and RBC within 8 weeks. In one patient, the downward trend was more rapid and sustained, and treatment had to be discontinued to prevent the development of anemia. Serum erythropoietin was normal in all four patients and remained unchanged throughout the study, even after discontinuation of enalapril treatment. Serum creatinine remained relatively stable throughout the study.

This may be related to a defect in tubular reabsorption. It is well known that inhibition of the converting enzyme reduces microalbuminuria and can prevent or delay diabetic nephropathy. We investigated whether enalapril also improves the defect in calcium and phosphate reabsorption. We studied 16 children and young adults (ages 12-21 years) with IDDM and persistent microalbuminuria before and during 12 weeks of treatment with enalapril. Before treatment, microalbuminuria, urinary calcium excretion, and fractionated tubular phosphorus reabsorption (TPR) were 153 +/- 53 micrograms/min, 5.5 +/- 0.9 mg/kg per day, and 71.4 +/- 3.6, respectively %.

Plasma catecholamine concentrations were significantly increased during NMS compared to supine before the incline. Oral enalapril resulted in a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure during the supine position before tilt, rather than placebo. Administration of enalapril prevented HUT-induced NMS and an increase in plasma catecholamine concentrations in all patients studied. Conversely, placebo had no effect in the majority of patients with NMS (12 out of 15 subjects).

The transmyocardial laser revascularization group was 32% female; 78.3% of patients had bypass surgery; mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 53.6 +/- 15%. 85% of patients with transmyocardial laser revascularization had detectable ischemic regions as visualized by dipyridamole MIBI scintigraphy. The percentage of patients with some hibernating myocardium in positron emission tomography studies was 70%. Good early relief of angina symptoms has been experienced by patients who have undergone laser treatment. At 3 months, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society grade fell from 3.31 +/- 0.51 to 1.84 +/- 0.77 in 49 patients (P < 0.0001) but increased to 2.02 in the overall group +/- 0.92 after 6 months (n = 47), to 2.26 +/- 0.99 after 1 year (n = 42), to 2.47 +/- 1.11 after 2 years (n = 38) and to 2.58 +/- 0.9 after 3 years (n = 19). Resting and 6-month MIBI/positron emission tomography data were worse in patients who completed the pre- and postoperative studies (n=22). The perioperative mortality was 12% (n = 7: perioperative myocardial infarction, low output syndrome, arrhythmia). Mortality at 1 and 3 years was 23% and 30%, respectively. The risk of transmyocardial laser revascularization was significantly increased in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%. Late deaths (n=9) were due to sudden arrhythmias or pump failure. There was a high rate of cardiac events and reinterventions in the transmyocardial laser revascularization group, including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for newly developed lesions (n=7), valve replacement (n=2), the need for intermittent urokinase therapy (n=5), and cardiac transplantation ( n = 2).; Fifty percent of patients with non-revascularizable coronary artery disease who undergo transmyocardial laser revascularization can be medically stabilized. Transmyocardial laser revascularization resulted in rapid, early symptomatic relief, but with a tendency to worsen over time, and showed a high perioperative risk (>10%) depending on the preoperative ejection fraction. Our data contrasted with other published reports on the more beneficial effects of transmyocardial laser revascularization and should prompt further investigation of this experimental method. Transmyocardial laser revascularization should only be performed after failure of maximal antianginal therapy and should be avoided if the left ventricular ejection fraction is < 40%.",0,0

In addition to this main result, the 4S provided detailed information on mortality rates and other manifestations of coronary artery disease and on the use of non-lipid therapies. There were significant cross-country differences in mortality rates, coronary deaths, and major coronary events in the 4S placebo group. Surgical and medical therapy varied greatly from country to country.; The large cross-country differences in rates of death and myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease were likely due to a combination of differences in baseline characteristics, including smoking. They emerged in an environment where the potential to improve survival for patients with ischemic heart disease was being exploited very unevenly.",0,0

All patients had a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% early after the infarction. Atrial natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, norepinephrine, and plasma renin activities progressively decreased over time. Patients with events had sustained increases in these neurohormones, with those who died within the first 24 months of follow-up showing the greatest increases. Treatment with captopril affected only plasma renin activity (increase) and aldosterone activity (decrease). In patients who remained asymptomatic in the first 3 months after the infarction (n = 471), according to multivariate analyzes (all neurohormones together with non-neurohumoral risk factors), the 3-month plasma atrial natriuretic peptides and aldosterone were most closely related to the Development of severe heart failure or the composite endpoints (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or severe heart failure). No neurohormone was associated with recurrent myocardial infarction or cardiovascular mortality. When the last neurohormone measured before an event was considered along with non-neurohumoral risk factors (adjusted univariate), atrial natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were associated with prognosis, indicating that a time-dependent analysis is a narrower one Relationship between neurohormones and events as identified by 3-month values. However, in multivariate analyses, atrial natriuretic peptide was the only neurohormone associated with an event, as it was associated with the development of severe heart failure (p<0.001) and the composite endpoints (p=0.022). However, when neurohormones were considered as binary variables, activated or not activated (defined as >1.96 SD above the mean of age-matched controls), there was an association between activation of norepinephrine before recurrent myocardial infarction (P<0.001) and the combined end -Points (P < 0.01) and identified between activation of aldosterone and severe heart failure (P < 0.05).; Neurohumoral activation progressively decreases after infarction, but only in patients with a good prognosis. In patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% and asymptomatic atrial natriuretic plasma peptide after infarction at 3 months, aldosterone levels appeared to be the neurohormones most closely associated with prognosis. Elevated concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, and norepinephrine appear to be most closely temporally associated with events.",0,0
2494,9821850,Benazepril causes a greater reduction in left ventricular mass than nitrendipine in hypertension: a randomized study using magnetic resonance imaging.,,"Gaudio, C; Tanzilli, G; Ferri, F M; Villatico Campbell, S; Bertocchi, F; Motolese, M; Campa, P P","To assess the comparative effects of benazepril and nitrendipine monotherapies on left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in hypertensive patients with echocardiographically determined left ventricular hypertrophy, patients with diastolic blood pressure (BP) > or = 100 mmHg were randomized to benazepril, 10 mg, or nitrendipine, 20 mg, both given once or twice daily. After 4 weeks, only responders (diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg) entered a 5-month maintenance phase. At the start of the study and after 3 and 6 months, the LVMI was estimated blindly using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, for comparison, using echocardiography. Of the 50 randomized patients, three were withdrawn from the study after 4 weeks as nonresponders; in addition, two patients taking benazepril and one taking nitrendipine discontinued treatment after 2 months due to side effects. Both monotherapies reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure to a similar extent. At 3 months, the MRI-estimated LVMI decreased by 21.5 g/m2 in the benazepril group and by 8.8 g/m2 in the nitrendipine group, with an adjusted mean difference between the two groups of 11.1 g /m2 (95% CI, 7.3-14.8 g/m2; p=0.0001). At 6 months, it decreased by 23.6 g/m2 and 10.0 g/m2, respectively, with an adjusted mean difference of 11.3 g/m2 (95% CI, 7.5-15.5; p=0 .0001) in favor of benazepril.

Subjects underwent bicycle ergometer exercise testing at 2 to 6 months (T1), 10 to 14 months (T2), and > 22 months (T3) after myocardial infarction.; Oxygen uptake (VO2), VCO2 and VE were measured during each exercise test. Dependent variables were peak VO2 (VO2peak), ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) and VE/VCO2 ratio measured at 30 W and at 75% VO2peak.; VO2peak and VAT did not differ as a result of treatment (CAP vs. PLC; p=0.92 and 0.80) or over time (T1 vs. T2 vs. T3; p=0.51 and 0.07). VE/VCO2 was significantly lower for CAP at 30 W (p=0.05) and, although lower at 75% VO2peak, did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.22). Differences between groups were greater at T2 and T3 compared to T1; CAP resulted in a reduced VE/VCO2 ratio during submaximal exercise. The reduced ventilation may allow patients to go about their normal activities of daily living with a lower perception of difficulty, reduce symptoms, and provide an improved quality of life.",0,0

2499,9829158,candesartan cilexetil. A review of its use in essential hypertension.,,"McClellan, K J; Goa, K L","Candesartan cilexetil is completely converted to the non-peptide angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan selectively blocks and slowly dissociates from the angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptor, which mediates most of the known activities of angiotensin II. When given once daily, candesartan cilexetil 8 to 32 mg orally is dose-dependent and effective in lowering blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. In comparative studies, candesartan cilexetil 8 mg/day was as effective as usual therapeutic doses of enalapril, losartan potassium, hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. One study showed that candesartan cilexetil 16 mg/day is more effective than losartan potassium 50 mg/day. In addition, the combination of candesartan cilexetil with either hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine resulted in additive antihypertensive effects. Preliminary evidence suggests that the antihypertensive effect of candesartan cilexetil is associated with the prevention or amelioration of end-organ damage in patients with hypertension. However, this requires further confirmation in clinical studies. Candesartan cilexetil improves insulin sensitivity in patients with hypertension and does not affect glucose homeostasis or serum lipid profile in patients with co-existing (non-insulin dependent) type 2 diabetes mellitus. Candesartan cilexetil is well tolerated in patients with hypertension. Pooled data show that the safety profile of the drug is not significantly different from that of placebo, with headache being the most commonly reported event. Side effects are not dose-dependent and mostly mild to moderate. Candesartan cilexetil is better tolerated than enalapril, primarily due to a lower frequency of cough, and was not associated with the hypokalemia or hyperuricaemia observed in a study of patients ≥ 75 years of age taking hydrochlorothiazide. The drug has a similar side effect profile to losartan potassium in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.; once daily Candesartan cilexetil is effective and well tolerated when administered once daily (as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive medicinal products) in patients with mild, moderate or severe hypertension. Initially, however, the drug will likely be used as an alternative to other drugs in patients who are unresponsive or unable to tolerate their current drug therapy.",0,0
2500,9829159,trandolapril. An update of its pharmacology and therapeutic application in cardiovascular disease.,,"Peters, D C; Noble, S; Plosker, G L","Trandolapril is an orally administered angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that has been used to treat patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF) and post-myocardial infarction (MI). Trandolapril is a nonsulfhydryl prodrug that is hydrolyzed to the active diacid, trandolaprilat. Trandolapril 2 mg once daily provides effective 24-hour blood pressure (BP) control in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, with a trough/peak ratio of BP reduction (as determined by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring) > or = 50% . Trandolapril has a blood pressure lowering effect similar to that of enalapril, as shown by several clinical studies. Combination therapy with delayed-release trandolapril and verapamil has a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either agent alone. There are limited data on the use of trandolapril in patients with CHF, although ACE inhibitors as a class are recommended as first-line therapy in such patients. In the Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study, trandolapril 1 to 4 mg once daily resulted in early and long-term reductions in all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular mortality, in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after MI. Trandolapril therapy was started an average of 4.5 days after acute MI and continued for 24 to 50 months. At the end of the study, the relative risk of death from any cause with trandolapril compared with placebo was 0.78 (p=0.001). The safety profile of trandolapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Most adverse events are mild and transient in nature and include cough, asthenia, dizziness, headache and nausea. Trandolapril has no negative effects on fat or carbohydrate metabolism.; Trandolapril has a favorable pharmacological profile and an antihypertensive effect at least comparable to that of other ACE inhibitors. The pharmacological properties of trandolapril allow good 24-hour blood pressure control with once-daily dosing. Trandolapril has also shown some effectiveness in a small number of patients with CHF. In addition, trandolapril provides long-term protection against all-cause mortality in patients with LV dysfunction after MI. Results from the Prevention of Events with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition (PEACE) study will determine its potential as a cardioprotective agent in patients with coronary artery disease and preserved LV function. Therefore, trandolapril represents an effective, well-tolerated, and convenient treatment option for patients with mild to moderate hypertension or LV systolic dysfunction after MI.",0,0

One hundred patients from 16 outpatient treatment centers in the United States were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized, gender-stratified, parallel-group, active- and placebo-controlled study. After a lisinopril challenge period and a placebo washout period, patients were randomized to receive losartan 50 mg once daily, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, or placebo for a maximum of 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the presence or absence of a dry cough during the double-masked phase, as assessed by the patient at each visit using a validated symptom assessment questionnaire. A secondary endpoint was the incidence of dry cough measured at each visit using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The incidence of dry cough was significantly higher in the lisinopril group than in the losartan and placebo groups (87.5% vs. 36.7% and 31.4%, respectively) at the end of the double-blind treatment period; There was no statistically significant difference between the losartan and placebo groups. Mean VAS scores showed that patients treated with lisinopril self-assessed a significantly higher frequency of cough than patients treated with losartan or placebo (4.0 vs. 1.2 and 1.5, respectively). Again, the difference between the losartan and placebo groups was not statistically significant. All treatments were otherwise well tolerated and no serious clinical or laboratory adverse events were reported during the double-blind phase of the study. These results indicate that the incidence, severity and frequency of dry cough in patients with a history of ACE inhibitor-induced dry cough are significantly lower in losartan-treated patients than in lisinopril-treated patients and similar to the incidence , Severity, and Frequency are frequency of dry cough in patients receiving placebo.",0,0

We conducted a 1-year, double-blind, randomized, double-dummy controlled study comparing nisoldipine (20-40 mg once daily) with lisinopril (10-20 mg once daily) in 48 hypertensive type 1 diabetic patients diabetic nephropathy. For comparison, 22 age-matched, normotensive, healthy controls were included. Measurements were taken at baseline and after 1 year of antihypertensive treatment. The minimum vascular resistance and the distensibility (rigidity) of resistance vessels in skin and skeletal muscle were measured using the local isotopic leaching method.3. Mean arterial pressure was reduced to the same extent in both groups: nisoldipine, 113 +/- 2.1 to 105 +/- 1.6 mmHg (P<0.001); Lisinopril, 110 +/- 2.7 to 101 +/- 2.1 mmHg (P<0.002) (controls, 88 +/- 2.2 mmHg; P<0.0001 compared to diabetics). Nisoldipine improved skin vascular compliance from 28 +/- 3.3 to 43 +/- 3.8% (p < 0.005) and decreased skin minimal vascular resistance from 16.9 +/- 1.0 to 13.6 +/- 0.8mmHg.ml-1.min. 100g (P<0.02). Lisinopril had no significant effect on skin vascular compliance (40 +/- 4.0% and 41 +/- 4.4%), but minimal vascular resistance tended to decrease (18.1 +/- 0.9 to 15, 8 +/- 1.3 mmHg.ml-1). min. 100 g (P=0.09) nisoldipine significantly increased skin compliance (P=0.05) after 1 year of antihypertensive treatment compared to lisinopril.4 The control group had a skin vascular compliance of 54 +/- 3.2 % and a minimum vascular resistance of 10.8 +/- 0.7 mmHg.ml-1.min.100 g, both significantly different from the values in the diabetic groups (P < 0.0001 for all) Skeletal muscle vascular compliance was after 1 year unchanged treatment with both nisoldipine (22+/-3.3% and 19+/-2.7%) and lisinopril (19+/-2.1% and 24+/-2.5%). but compared to a control value of 43+/- reduced 3.7% (P<0.0001 for diabetic patients versus controls). However, neither nisoldipine nor lisinopril had any effect on increased minimum vascular resistance or decreased skeletal muscle compliance.5. Increased thickening of the basement membranes of the terminal arteriolar wall was found in skin biopsy specimens in 91% of diabetics and only 38% of controls (P<0.000001 both before and after treatment of diabetics versus controls). There was no significant effect of antihypertensive treatment on arteriolar hyalinosis.6. The reduction in systemic blood pressure was identical over 1 year of treatment with either nisoldipine or lisinopril. Abnormal arteriolar stiffness was more pronounced in the nisoldipine-treated group than lisinopril, and only nisoldipine improved abnormal arteriolar stiffness and minimal vascular resistance in the skin compared to lisinopril. This suggests that nisoldipine can reverse peripheral skin perfusion and thereby improve local protection against the development of ischemic skin lesions in type 1 diabetic patients with clinical diabetic nephropathy.",0,0

After an additional 4-week washout period, patients were switched to the alternative regimen for an additional 6 weeks. At the end of the placebo and active treatment periods, blood pressure (BP) was measured (using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer, Korotkoff I and V) and insulin sensitivity was determined by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. The glucose infusion rate (GIR) during the last 30 minutes of the clamp and the total glucose requirement (TGR) were assessed.; Both lisinopril and losartan significantly reduced SBP (by an average of 20.2 and 17.2 mmHg, respectively) and DBP (by an average of 15.2 and 12.3 mmHg, respectively), with no difference between the two treatments.

However, it was found that the isradipine excess events were more frequent in patients with elevated baseline HbA1c values who also experienced greater blood pressure reductions during follow-up.; The increased cardiovascular risk associated with dihydropyridine-CAs in prediabetic patients could explain the general CA debate.",0,0
2508,9842405,Long-term effect of converting enzyme inhibition on circadian sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy.,,"Athyros, V G; Didangelos, T P; Karamitsos, D T; Papageorgiou, A A; Boudoulas, H; Kontopoulos, A G","Autonomic nervous system function in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), particularly those with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN), shows an abnormal circadian pattern compared to healthy subjects; this likely plays an important role in the etiology of acute cardiovascular syndromes, which have a similar pattern of onset compared to non-diabetics, with a weakened late morning peak and an increase in nocturnal episodes. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, quinapril, on the circadian pattern of heart rate variability (HRV), a reliable index of sympathovagal interactions, in patients with definite DAN; Normalized HRV frequency domain indices [high frequency power (HFP) reflecting vagal tone, low frequency power (LFP) reflecting both vagal and sympathetic (predominantly) modulation and their ratio (LFP/HFP) indicative of sympathovagal balance ] were evaluated in 60 patients with DAN at baseline and one year after therapy with quinapril (n=30) or placebo (n=30) on a 24-hour 2-lead electrocardiogram with a semiconductor Holter monitor. Normal subjects (n = 30) and patients with DM without DAN (n = 30) served as controls. Circadian baseline variation in fractional normalized performance in DAN patients was abolished, with marked dominance of LFP over HFP throughout the 24-hour period. After one year of treatment, quinapril increased HFP, decreased LFP and improved their ratio in the AM (07:00 to 15:00) and night (23:00 to 07:00) time intervals, with maximum effect in the nocturnal time interval (HFP = 20%, LFP = -8%, LFP/HFP = -31%, for all comparisons p<0.05 vs baseline and p<0.001 vs one year placebo). Quinapril increased HFP and decreased LFP and their ratio, all suggesting a reduction in sympathetic predominance, in patients with DAN these indices were most affected at time intervals (morning and evening). Since autonomic function is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of acute coronary events, malignant arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death, improving autonomic function indices in DAN patients at these time intervals may prove beneficial in clinical practice.",0,0

This study also evaluated whether the addition of indomethacin (75 mg twice daily) to each of the two treatments resulted in a greater antiproteinuric effect. Enalapril alone reduced total protein excretion (61% change from baseline) and fractional clearance of albumin without changes in GFR and a small increase in renal plasma flow. Also, patients randomized to receive the AngII receptor antagonist irbesartan for 28 days had less proteinuria (55% change from baseline) and fractional clearance of albumin at the end of the treatment period, with similar renal hemodynamic changes. When indomethacin was added to treatment with enalapril, a further significant reduction in urinary proteins and fractional albumin clearance was observed. In patients receiving irbesartan, the addition of indomethacin further reduced proteinuria and fractional clearance of albumin. Combination therapy with enalapril or irbesartan and indomethacin did not significantly affect GFR and renal plasma flow compared to baseline. These findings indicate that in patients with IgA glomerulonephritis, the antiproteinuric effect of blocking AngII activity by ACE inhibitors or AngII receptor antagonists is potentiated by indomethacin, an effect that occurred without impairment of renal function.",0,0

Beta-blocker therapy has been shown to be effective in improving clinical status and left ventricular function in patients with heart failure. Similarly, high doses of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with nitrates partially reverse ventricular remodeling in heart failure.; We tested the hypothesis that beta-blocker therapy in addition to high-dose ACE inhibitor nitrates would potentiate reversal of heart failure.; Thirteen patients aged 52 +/- 8 years with moderate to severe heart failure, 12 of whom were referred for transplantation consideration, with a heart failure duration of 4.8 +/- 2.2 years, were followed prospectively for 12 months. The echocardiographic ejection fraction at baseline was 19 +/- 8% and the New York Heart Association class was 2.9 +/- 0.7. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and nitrates were up-titrated over 6 months to a final dose of 53 +/- 31 mg/day lisinopril and 217 +/- 213 mg/day isosorbide dinitrate. After 6 months, beta-blocker therapy with atenolol was initiated and titrated to a final dose of 46 +/- 23 mg/day. Two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography and metabolic stress tests were performed at baseline, after 6 months on lisinopril nitrates alone, and after 12 months on combined ACE inhibitor nitrate and beta-blocker therapy.; The New York Heart Association classification improved from 2.9 +/- 0.7 to 1.8 +/- 0.8 on lisinopril nitrates (p<0.05) and to 1.5 +/- 0, 5 with additional beta blockade (p = NS). At follow-up, peak oxygen consumption increased from 17 +/- 7 mL O2/kg/min at baseline to 21 +/- 5 mL O2/kg/min at 6 months on lisinopril nitrates (p = 0.06) with no further change on beta blockade. Ejection fraction increased from 19 +/- 8 to 33 +/- 14% on lisinopril nitrates at 6 months (p = 0.005) and to 36 +/- 18% on beta-blockade at 12 months (p = NS); High-dose ACE inhibitor nitrate therapy significantly improved the patient's clinical condition and left ventricular systolic function in heart failure. The addition of beta-blockade to high-dose ACE inhibitor nitrates was well tolerated but had no additional effects on symptomatic status, exercise tolerance, or left ventricular systolic function. The potential for pharmacologic reversal of heart failure remodeling may be limited despite the use of complementary therapies. Larger placebo-controlled, randomized trials of beta-blockade in addition to high-dose ACE inhibitor nitrate therapy are needed to confirm these observations.",0,0

In a longer-term study, we evaluated the effects of daily doses of 60 mg or 30 mg vesnarinone compared to placebo on mortality and morbidity.; We enrolled 3833 patients who, despite optimal management, had symptoms of New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30 percent or less. The mean follow-up time was 286 days.; There were significantly fewer deaths in the placebo group (242 deaths or 18.9 percent) than in the vesnarinone 60 mg group (292 deaths or 22.9 percent) and longer survival (p=0.02). The increase in mortality with vesnarinone was attributed to an increase in sudden death, thought to be due to arrhythmia. Quality of life had improved significantly more in the vesnarinone 60 mg group than in the placebo group at 8 weeks (P<0.001) and 16 weeks (P=0.003) after randomization. The trends in mortality and quality of life measures in the vesnarinone 30 mg group were similar to those in the 60 mg group but were not significantly different from those in the placebo group. Agranulocytosis occurred in 1.2 percent of patients receiving vesnarinone 60 mg per day and 0.2 percent of patients receiving vesnarinone 30 mg.; Vesnarinone is associated with a dose-dependent increase in mortality in patients with severe heart failure, an increase that is likely related to an increase in arrhythmia-related deaths. A short-term quality of life benefit raises questions about the appropriate therapeutic goal in the management of heart failure.",0,0

The following parameters were calculated for systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure: (1) hourly and 24-hour mean blood pressures (+/- SD) at baseline and after 3 and 12 months of treatment; (2) Hourly blood pressure changes from baseline after 3 and 12 months of treatment and their mean (+/- SD) over 24 hours; (3) the trough-to-peak ratio after 3 and 12 months of treatment; and (4) the smoothness index after 3 and 12 months of treatment. Similar calculations were also performed at the end of a final month of the study, during which active treatment was discontinued and placebo substituted (n=164); The smoothness index for systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure calculated after 3 months of treatment was more closely related to the corresponding values after 12 months of treatment than the values of the trough-to-peak ratio calculated after the same time periods (r = 0.68 versus 0.38 for systolic and 0.68 versus 0.42 for diastolic blood pressure).

2514,9856958,Effect of activation and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system on plasma PAI-1.,,"Brown, N J; Agirbasli, M A; Williams, G H; Litchfield, W R; Vaughan, D E","Elevated plasma renin activity (PRA) has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI), while inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) appears to reduce the risk of recurrent MI in patients with left ventricular dysfunction . These observations can be partially explained by an interaction between the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the fibrinolytic system. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of salt depletion on tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity and antigen in normotensive subjects in the presence and absence of quinapril (40 mg BID). Under low (10 mmol/d) and high (200 mmol/d) salt conditions, there was significant diurnal variation in PAI-1 antigen and activity and in tPA antigen. In the morning (8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.), PAI-1 antigen levels were significantly higher with low salt intake than with high salt intake conditions (ANOVA, F=5.8, P=0.048). PAI-1 antigen correlated with aldosterone (r=0.56, P<10(-7)) at low salt intake. ACE inhibition reduced PAI-1 antigen and PAI-1 activity (F=6.48, P=0.002) over 24 hours (ANOVA for 24 hours, F=6.7, P=0.04) and in the morning (F=24, P=0.002) significantly 0.038), but did not alter the tPA antigen. Thus, mean morning PAI-1 antigen concentration was significantly higher with low salt intake than with either high salt intake or low salt intake and concomitant ACE inhibition (22.7 +/- 4.6 versus 16, 1 +/- 3.3, and 16 .3 +/- 3.7 ng/mL; P<0.05). This study provides evidence for a direct functional link between the RAS and the fibrinolytic system in humans. The data suggest that ACE inhibition has the potential to reduce the occurrence of thrombotic cardiovascular events by attenuating the morning peak of PAI-1.",0,0

We studied 244 patients with mild to moderate CHF (New York Heart Association class II-III: +/-80%/20%) who were stable on digoxin and diuretics. Patients were treated for 12 weeks and the key endpoints were exercise capacity and plasma neurohormones.; At baseline, the four treatment groups were well matched in terms of demographic variables. Of the 244 patients, 25 dropped out: 3 patients died and 9 developed progressive CHF (3/182 patients on imidapril vs. 6/62 patients on placebo, p<0.05).

Renin increased in a dose-dependent manner, but plasma ACE activity was similarly suppressed (+/-60%) at all three doses. Already within 3 months after the start of treatment, high-dose ACE inhibition (with imidapril) is superior to low-dose. This is reflected in a more pronounced effect on exercise capacity and some of the neurohormones, but does not appear to be related to the extent of plasma ACE suppression.",0,0

Therapy with enalapril was associated with a significant reduction in the relative risk of mortality (RR=0.819, 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.98; p=0.03). This resulted in a survival gain of 0.11 years (95% CI: 0.00 to 0.20 years) during the mean follow-up of 2.8 years for this subgroup and should result in a gain of 2.14 years (95% CI : 0.05 to 4.21) lead years) to the patient's lifetime. Enalapril significantly reduced the risk of first heart failure hospitalization by 37%. Across all types of hospitalizations, there was an average reduction of 32 hospitalizations per 100 patients treated with enalapril during the study period (95% CI: 11.8 to 52.2 hospitalizations avoided per 100 patients), resulting in an estimated net saving of $1656 per patient during the study period resulted in savings of $3502 during the trial period (95% CI: increased cost of $191). Although the projected net lifetime savings of $1,456 were not significant (95% CI: increased cost of $9,243 to savings of $12,527), evaluation of the cost per life year saved indicated that enalapril was a cost-effective strategy. The estimated clinical benefit of enalapril in the SOLVD subset of hypertensive patients supports the recommendation that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be considered as first-line pharmacologic therapy for hypertensive patients with left ventricular dysfunction.

To determine the success of single and combination therapy in achieving blood pressure goals in such a population.; INSIGHT is a double-blind, prospective outcomes study comparing the efficacy of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine GITS and the thiazide co-amilozid in preventing myocardial infarction and stroke. We recruited 2996 men and 3454 women aged 55 to 80 years with placebo run-in BP > 150/95 mmHg or isolated systolic BP > 160 mmHg from nine countries. Treatment allocation to nifedipine GITS 30 mg daily or co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/amiloride 5 mg) once daily was by minimization rather than randomization to compensate for additional risk factors. This was followed by four optional increases in treatment: doubling the dose of the primary drug, adding atenolol 25/50 mg or enalapril 5/10 mg, and then any other antihypertensive drug except calcium blockers or diuretics. Target blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg or a fall > or = 20/10 mmHg; Blood pressure at randomization was 172 +/- 15/99 +/- 9 mmHg. 13 percent of patients were previously untreated.

This study evaluated the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy (captopril) in these patients in the early postoperative period.; Over a 5-year period, 298 patients with persistently reduced cardiac output required support (>48 to 72 hours) with IABP plus two or three inotropes. This cohort was randomized into two groups, Group A (195 patients), who continued to receive IABP and inotropes, and Group B (103 patients), who received an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, 48 to 72 hours after received and continued IABP and inotropes after surgery.; Tissue perfusion and hemodynamic parameters improved (p<0.0001) in Group B with early termination of IABP (duration of support means 86 hours in Group B versus 169 hours in Group A) and inotropics. The maximal improvement in tissue perfusion and hemodynamic parameters correlated with decreased serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels. In-hospital mortality occurred in 31% of patients in group A and 14.5% in group B. Morbidity complications occurred in 37% of patients in group A and 20% in group B. The mean length of hospital stay in group A was 27 days and 17 days in group B. Cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, gastrointestinal, renal and neurological complications were common in both groups.; Administration of ACE inhibitors in the early postoperative period in patients with severe postcardiotomy dysfunction resulted in an improvement in tissue perfusion with a reduction in mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay. These drugs restored the stunned myocardium by effectively limiting the physiological effects induced by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and other mechanisms.

A 24-hour blood pressure recording was performed each time, followed by a clearance study to generate a 3-hour dose-response curve for intravenously infused NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 0.75, 1 .5 and 3.0 mg/kg/h).; L-NMMA dose-dependently increased mean arterial pressure by 5 +/- 2 mmHg and systemic vascular resistance by 24 +/- 5% at maximum dose, while cardiac output decreased (all P<0.001). Treatment with enalapril and nifedipine reduced blood pressure while potentiating the L-NMMA-induced increase in systemic vascular resistance (enalapril: 45 +/- 7% and nifedipine: 46 +/- 8%; both p<0.01). L-NMMA also dose-dependently decreased renal blood flow by 58 +/- 8% at the maximum dose (P<0.001), but neither drug potentiated these effects.; These results indicate that in essential hypertensive patients, antihypertensive therapy with enalapril or nifedipine increases nitric oxide dependence of systemic vascular tone, which may play a role in the antihypertensive effects of these drugs. However, this phenomenon is not observed in the renal circulation, suggesting a different regulation of endothelium-dependent vasomotion in the hypertensive kidney.",0,0

Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) is the most important physiological inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator in plasma. Elevated PAI levels have been reported to be associated with decreased fibrinolytic capacity and are a marker of risk of recurrent coronary thrombosis.; We measured serum ACE activity and plasma PAI activity in 34 patients with recent myocardial infarction and assessed the correlation between these two values by linear regression analysis. We also randomly administered captopril (37.5 mg/day) to 17 of these patients and placebo to the other 17 patients and compared the changes in PAI activity and ACE activity in these two groups over a 1-month period. ; There was a significant correlation between serum ACE activity and baseline plasma PAI activity in patients (r=0.498, P<0.01). The patients treated with captopril showed a significantly reduced PAI activity (P < 0.01) and a concomitant decrease in ACE activity.; These results suggest that increased ACE activity is associated with impaired fibrinolysis and that treatment with an ACE inhibitor improves fibrinolytic function in patients with recent myocardial infarction. The results also suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a role in the increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular events when activated and in reducing the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction with ACE inhibition.",0,0
2536,9928746,Target organ involvement in hypertensive patients in eastern Sudan.,,"Hussain, A A; Elzubier, A G; Ahmed, M E","Hypertension has become a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. In a cross-sectional study, we examined the status of blood pressure control and the pattern of target organ complications in 198 Sudanese patients treated at a teaching hospital in the city of Kassala in eastern Sudan (mean age 53 years, 76% women). . Excellent blood pressure control (BP < 140/90 mm Hg) was achieved in 46% of patients. One-third of patients were diagnosed with stage 2 or 3 target organ involvement, specifically albuminuria and ischemic heart disease. These complications have been found to be related to both the severity and duration of hypertension and the frequency of cigarette smoking. Factors such as poor compliance, unfavorable socioeconomic status, and obesity and cigarette smoking may be responsible for poor blood pressure control and thus the development of hypertensive complications. We conclude that most hypertensive patients in Sudan have not yet achieved optimal blood pressure control. Reasons for this failure should be identified and corrected to avoid hypertensive target organ damage.",0,0

A 2-year, prospective, randomized study was conducted in 51 men with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 95 and < or = 105 mm Hg, stable NIDDM, serum creatinine between 1.6 and 3.0 mg/dl and persistent UAE > performed 300 and <2000 mg/24 h. After a 3-month preliminary observation period, during which patients were started on a low-protein and low-sodium diet, and a subsequent 4-week run-in period on placebo, patients were randomized to receive ramipril 5 mg or nitrendipine 20 mg for 2 years. Both drugs similarly lowered blood pressure without affecting glucose homeostasis. In the ramipril group, the UAE decreased significantly after only 3 months of treatment, while in the nitrendipine group a significant, albeit smaller, reduction in UAE was only observed after 1 year. During the second year, the percent change in UAE was not statistically different between the two treatments. Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance showed no significant change with either drug. The progression of renal failure, as measured by the rate of decrease in creatinine clearance over the 2 years of the study, was similar in the ramipril and nitrendipine groups. In conclusion, both ramipril and nitrendipine were associated with a decrease in AE, although such a decrease was earlier and more pronounced with ramipril. The decrease in renal function did not differ significantly between the two treatments.",0,0
2538,9928753,Improved efficacy while maintaining tolerability in the treatment of primary hypertension. Comparison between the felodipine-metoprolol combination tablet and enalapril monotherapy. Swedish multicenter group.,,"Andersson, O K","In this multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study, 120 outpatients with mild to moderate primary hypertension were randomized to a felodipine-metoprolol 5 combination tablet after a 4-week, single-blind placebo run-in period. 50 mg (Logimax, Mobloc, Astra) once daily or enalapril 10 mg once daily. If blood pressure (BP) remained suboptimal (supine diastolic BP > 90 mm Hg 24 h after dosing) at 4 weeks, the dose was doubled for an additional 4 weeks. After 8 weeks, felodipine-metoprolol reduced supine blood pressure significantly more than enalapril (19.7/12.0 mmHg and 11.1/7.2 mmHg, respectively). The mean difference in blood pressure change between treatments was 8.6/4.8 mm Hg in favor of felodipine metoprolol (P=0.001/P<0.001). A statistically significant difference in favor of felodipine-metoprolol was also found in standing blood pressure. Although the dose was increased in a greater proportion of patients in the enalapril group (61%) than in the felodipine-metoprolol group (40%), fewer enalapril-treated patients achieved adequate blood pressure control (41% versus 63% on felodipine -metoprolol). metoprolol, P<0.05). Both treatments were well tolerated. Three patients treated with felodipine-metoprolol and four with enalapril discontinued treatment due to side effects. A similar number of patients reported adverse events in each treatment group. In summary, a combination tablet of felodipine-metoprolol 5/50-10/100 mg once daily was more effective than enalapril 10-20 mg once daily in reducing blood pressure 24 hours after dosing. The result was as expected, but a more important observation was that both treatments were tolerated to a similar extent. Apparently, a significant drop in blood pressure can be well tolerated, which was the main purpose to demonstrate in this study.",0,0

Treatment was initiated with a response-based three-stage dose titration phase. All patients were initiated on dose level 1 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 120/0.5 mg once daily) and, if not normalized (DBP <90 mmHg), progressed at 4-week intervals through dose level 2 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/ 1 mg once daily) titrated to dose level 3 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 mg once daily) during the first 12 weeks. After 3 months of treatment, all non-normalized patients were discontinued from further participation in the study. The total duration of the treatment period was 6 months. Routine safety assessments were conducted before, during and after the completion of the treatment period. Verapamil SR/trandolapril was highly effective in lowering blood pressure. At the last individual visit during active treatment (including non-responders), the mean reduction in SBP/DBP was 21.9/17.1 mm Hg (95% CI 19.8-24.1/16.1- 18.1 mm Hg), with most of the reduction occurring during the first 3 months of treatment. At 6 months, 81.9% of enrolled patients showed normalization of DBP (< 90 mm Hg) and 85% were responders (normalization and/or reduction of DBP by at least 10 mm Hg). Normalization and response rates appeared comparable when stratified by age subgroups (63-69, 70-79, and > or = 80 years) and were all greater than 80%. Verapamil SR/trandolapril was very well tolerated and there was no evidence of clinically relevant changes in routine laboratory safety variables or the resting ECG. In conclusion, the fixed-dose combination of Verapamil SR/trandolapril is an effective and safe alternative treatment for elderly patients with hypertension.",0,0

We evaluated the echocardiographic examinations performed during the study to assess the trend of the remodeling process over time and to assess the role of infarct size in identifying patients at risk of progressive left ventricular dilatation.; A complete echocardiographic examination was performed on admission, before discharge, and three months later. Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery or PTCA underwent further evaluation prior to the procedure. The echocardiograms were analyzed in a central laboratory and the left ventricular volumes at end-diastole and end-systole were calculated using a modified Simpson's rule technique. Regional wall motion was assessed using the midline method, analyzing the left ventricular border along 100 tendons perpendicular to the midline constructed midway between the end-diastolic and end-systolic contours. A quantitative infarct size index was then calculated according to the number of tendons with a fractional shortening equal to or less than 5%; Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indices increased significantly over time (p<0.0001); As a result, stroke volume increased (p<0.0001) but ejection fraction did not change. Patients were then graded according to the three-month infarct size index. For both end-diastolic and end-systolic volume, larger infarcts not only had higher volume, but there was also a larger increase from baseline to 3 months. In addition, larger infarcts had lower ejection fractions, with a further reduction over the three months, while smaller infarcts had higher values and an increase over time. An infarct size index of 25 or greater allowed prospective identification at baseline of patients at risk of later left ventricular dilatation.; In conclusion, patients at greatest risk of left ventricular dilatation, namely those with larger infarct size, represent a group worth considering in therapeutic efforts to reduce the remodeling process. Indeed, these patients may benefit from therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing left ventricular remodeling and should be investigated in clinical trials.",0,0

Interleukin (IL)-5 regulates the number of eosinophils with the help of IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Blood IL-5 levels have been reported to be elevated in patients with eosinophilia secondary to parasitic infections or idiopathic eosinophilia, but have never been studied in drug-induced eosinophilia. The aim of our study was to determine whether IL-5, IL-3 and GM-CSF are involved in eosinophilia in patients with drug-induced HSS. Plasma levels of IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF were measured by ELISA in seven patients with drug-induced HSS, eight patients with cutaneous adverse drug reactions not associated with eosinophilia, and five patients with eosinophilia not associated related to drug treatment. IL-5 levels were normal in all eight patients with drug eruptions without eosinophilia and elevated in five of the seven patients with HSS. In the latter patients, IL-5 levels peaked several days before the highest eosinophil counts were detected and returned to normal within a few days, even if eosinophilia persisted. In patients with eosinophilia unrelated to drug treatment, IL-5 levels, although significantly elevated, remained lower than in HSS patients. IL-3 and GM-CSF could not be detected in any group at any time point. Our results indicate that IL-5 is involved in drug-induced eosinophilia. Since IL-5 production was only involved in the early stages of the reaction, it is hypothesized that IL-5 originates mainly from activated lymphocytes and not from eosinophils. Our results support the clinical relevance of previous in vitro findings. Further studies are needed to test whether assays of IL-5 production by lymphocytes from patients stimulated by the suspected drug and/or its metabolites are useful in establishing causality in drug-induced responses associated with eosinophilia.",0,0
