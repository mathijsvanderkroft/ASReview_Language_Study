1,"Binding Selectivity of Methanobactin from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b for Copper(I), Silver(I), Zinc(II), Nickel(II), Cobalt(II), Manganese(II), Lead(II) and Iron(II)","Methanobactin (Mb) from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b is a member of a class of metal-binding peptides identified in methanotrophic bacteria. Mb selectively binds and reduces Cu(II) to Cu(I) and is thought to mediate the acquisition of the copper cofactor for the enzyme methane monooxygenase. These copper-chelating properties of Mb make it potentially useful as a chelating agent in the treatment of diseases in which copper is implicated, including Wilson's disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Using traveling wave ion mobility mass spectrometry (TWIMS), the competition for the Mb-copper binding site from Ag(I), Pb(II), Co(II), Fe(II), Mn(II), Ni(II ) , and Zn(II) was determined by a series of metal ion titrations, pH titrations, and metal ion displacement titrations. The TWIMS analyzes allowed for the explicit identification and quantification of all individual Mb species present during the titrations and measured their collision cross-sections and collision-induced dissociation patterns. The results showed that Ag(I) and Ni(II) bind irreversibly to Mb and could not be effectively displaced by Cu(I), while Ag(I) could also partially displace Cu(I) from the Mb complex. At pH = 6.5, Mb binding selectivity follows the order Ag(I)=Cu(I)>Ni(II)=Zn(II)>Co(II)>>Mn(II)=Pb(II)>Fe (II), and at pH 7.5 to 10.4 the order is Ag(I)>Cu(I)>Ni(II)>Co(II)>Zn(II)>Mn(II)=Pb(II )>Fe(II). ). Degradation curves of the disulfide-reduced Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes showed that there was a correlation between their relative stability and their compact folded structure, indicated by their CCS. Fluorescence spectroscopy, which allowed the determination of the binding constant, correlated well with the TWIMS analyses, with the exception of the Ni(II) complex. Graphic summary.",,"McCabe, J.

2,Characteristics and prevalence of Wilson's disease: A 2013 population-based observational study in France,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Few epidemiological studies of the incidence and prevalence of Wilson's disease (WM) have been conducted to date, and the results vary widely by report. The aim of the study was to examine the prevalence, outpatient care and treatments of patients with WM in France. METHODS: Among the 58 million beneficiaries of the universal health insurance scheme (86% of the French population) in 2013, people treated for WM were enrolled based on a diagnosis of hospitalization in 2011-2013 or specific long-term disease status with 100% reimbursement identified for a specific healthcare provision in 2013. Data is from the Sniiram (National Health Insurance Information System database). The prevalence by age and gender was calculated. RESULTS: In 2013, 906 prevalent cases were identified, giving a rough prevalence of 1.5 cases per 100,000; 1.65 per 100,000 in males and 1.44 per 100,000 in females. This prevalence is comparable to that found in other population-based studies in European countries and to a study using a similar methodology. Almost 40% of the patients were treated with D-penicillamine and 14.3% with zinc acetate. Trientine, delivered on a compassionate basis, was not available in the reimbursement database. In 2013, 1.3% of patients underwent liver transplantation and 4% had previously undergone liver transplantation in previous years. Fifteen percent of patients received antidepressants, a higher rate than in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population-based epidemiological study on WM in a large population in France based on administrative data and represents an important step towards understanding the impact of WM and examining the quality of care.",,"Poujois, A.;Woimant, F.;Samson, S.;Chaine, P.;Girardot-Tinant, N.;Tuppin, P.",2017,2022-06-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinre.2017.05.011,0,1,
3,Treatment modality and possible outcome of Wilson's disease in Taiwan: A population-based longitudinal study,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the epidemiology, drug preference and possible outcome of Wilson's disease in Taiwan. Our goal was to provide better therapeutic options for patients with Wilson's disease based on the data generated from this study. METHODS: We used the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which stores clinical records for nearly 99% of Taiwan residents. The database used is a random sample of two million out of 23 million beneficiaries in Taiwan's NHIRD in 2005. The integrated medical records of these two million cases were collected from 2000 to 2011. Patients with Wilson's disease were identified as those with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 275.1 and the specific prescription medications (including D-penicillamine, zinc, and trientine) in either outpatient or inpatient records. RESULTS: During the study period, 66 cases of Wilson's disease were identified. The male to female ratio was 1.75. The mean prevalence rate was 1.81 per 100,000 and the mean annual diagnosis rate was 0.22 per 100,000. Diagnosis was mostly made between the ages of 20–24 and 10–14 years, followed by 25–29 years. Fifty-four of all subjects (81.8%) started treatment with D-penicillamine compared to zinc (12.1%) and trientine (6.1%). Of these 66 cases, 27 (40.9%) had cirrhosis and three (4.5%) underwent liver transplantation due to liver failure. CONCLUSIONS: D-penicillamine remains the most popular prescription for Wilson's disease, followed by zinc monotherapy. Although chronic liver damage cannot be avoided, a favorable potential outcome is evident in this population-based study. Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier BV",,"Tai, C. S.;Wu, J. F.;Chen, H.

4,"The early history of manganese and the recognition of its neurotoxicity, 1837-1936","The history of biomedical recognition of manganese-induced neurotoxicity is also reflected, as is the ontology of parkinsonism. The first report of manganese-induced neurological injury was made by John Couper, a university doctor in Scotland, in 1837. He made it clear that the outbreak occurred among workers at the Charles Tennant bleach factory in the Glasgow area. The relatively new technology of chlorine generation using manganese was responsible for the novel exposure involved. At the time, this factory was the world's largest producer of hypochlorite bleach powder. During the 19th century, technological changes in steelmaking that required higher levels of manganese greatly increased demand for the metal. Nevertheless, more than six decades passed before the next reports of manganese neurotoxicity appeared. Two independent eruptions (both on continental Europe) were reported within a few weeks in 1901, one from Jaksch and the other from Embden. All housings were exposed to dust with a high manganese content. Up to the eve of the First World War, a total of 9 patients with manganese-related neurological diseases were reported in five separate continental European publications. Meanwhile, new technology led to another source of exposure. Magnetic separation techniques enabled the extraction of zinc from mixed ore that also contained iron and manganese, leading to the exploitation of a unique source of high manganese ore found in New Jersey. Not long after the introduction of this technology, Casamajor reported the first cases of manganism in the United States in 1912, detailing classic findings. Other cases from the same cohort were reported a few years later, with continued exposure due to World War I demand for manganese for use in armaments. The nosology of chronic manganese neurotoxicity has remained fluid, with significant emphasis on commonalities with Wilson's disease, a syndrome only recently described. A landmark 1924 primate study by Mella showed manganese-induced damage to basal ganglia; Data from human autopsy studies over the following years further supported the view that manganese toxicity constituted Parkinson's disease. As the 100th anniversary of Couper's first report neared, newer technologies (arc welding and battery manufacturing) were linked to manganese-related diseases even as mineral extraction increased as a global source of exposure.

5,Zinc monotherapy for young children with presymptomatic Wilson's disease: a multicenter study in Japan,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Few studies of zinc monotherapy in presymptomatic Wilson's disease have focused on young children. We therefore evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for such children and established benchmarks for maintenance therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively and prospectively studied children younger than 10 years of age with presymptomatic Wilson's disease who received zinc monotherapy from the time of diagnosis at 12 participating pediatric centers in Japan. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients met the entry criteria. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase decreased significantly from 1 month after starting treatment and generally remained below 50 U/L from 1 to 8 years of treatment. 24-hour urinary copper decreased significantly at 6 months and usually remained below 75 micrograms/day and between 1 and 3 micrograms/kg/day for the remainder of the study. All patients continued to take zinc and none became symptomatic. In patients less than 6 years of age who received 50 mg/day zinc as an initial dose, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase decreased significantly 1 month after the start of treatment, as did gamma-glutamyltransferase and 24-hour urinary copper after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter study of zinc monotherapy in young children with presymptomatic Wilson's disease. Such monotherapy proved to be highly effective and safe. Maintaining normal transaminase levels (or below 50 U/L if normalization is difficult) and a 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 micrograms/kg/day and below 75 micrograms/day is a reasonable goal. A starting dose of 50 mg/day is suitable for patients under 6 years of age. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

6,[Elastosis perforans serpiginosa and Wilson's disease: A rare but predictable consequence of long-term therapy with D-penicillamine],"Elastosis perfurans serpiginosa is a rare perforating dermatosis that occurs mainly in adolescents and young adults and is characterized by the transepidermal elimination of abnormal elastic fibers. The only drug known to be able to induce elastosis perfurans serpiginosa is D-penicillamine. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with keratotic papules arranged in a ring-shaped pattern with a central glare and centrifugal growth, located in the anterior part of the neck. The patient was chronically treated with D-penicillamine for Wilson's disease. Lesion biopsy showed transepidermal elimination of thickened, eosinophilic, branched, sawtooth-like elastic fibers. The clinical and pathologic findings were consistent with serpiginous perfuration elastosis secondary to D-penicillamine. It is estimated that elastosis perfurans serpiginosa occurs in 1% of patients treated with D-penicillamine. By directly or indirectly blocking the desmosin crosslinks between elastin molecules, D-penicillamine leads to the synthesis of abnormal dermal and extracutaneous elastic fibers. Elastosis perfurans serpiginosa may be the first manifestation of a multisystemic degenerative process of elastic connective tissue.",,"Castro Pinho, A.;Cardoso, J.

7,Combination therapy with chelating agents and zinc in Wilson's disease,"There is no clear international consensus on the optimal drug therapy for the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD). This study systematically reviews the efficacy of various commonly used drug therapies and specifically focuses on preliminary results on the combination of a chelating agent with zinc. A systematic PubMed search was conducted to find original studies published between January 1989 and August 2014 on the efficacy of commonly used drugs for WM. The results were used to conduct a systematic review of trials of combination therapies. A total of 17 studies on combination therapy with 1056 patients were reviewed. These were analyzed for data on efficacy, side effects and mortality. The results of a pooled analysis indicate that combination therapies were significantly less effective in liver patients than the same therapies for neurological manifestations (47.1 vs. 78.6%; pooled relative risk ratio (RR): 0.63, 95% confidence interval CI 0.43-0.94; p=0.02). Data from a subgroup analysis show that penicillamine plus zinc sulfate combination therapy resulted in a significantly higher mortality rate compared to all other combination therapies (16.3 vs. 4.7%; RR: 3.51, 95% CI 1.54-8 .00; p < 0.001 ). The use of zinc-chelating agent combination therapies should be carefully monitored by close clinical observation and frequent biochemical testing, particularly in WM patients with hepatic manifestations.",,"Chen, J.

8,Long-term effects of a combination of D-penicillamine and zinc salts in the treatment of Wilson's disease in children,"The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a combination of high-dose zinc sulfate and low-dose D-penicillamine in the treatment of pediatric Wilson's disease (WD). A retrospective file review of 65 patients with WD was performed. These patients received D-penicillamine (8-10 mg/kg/day) and zinc sulfate as primary treatment. The pediatric dose of elemental zinc is 68 to 85 mg/day by age 6, 85 to 136 mg/day by age 8, 136 to 170 mg/day by age 10, and then 170 mg/day by age Day 3 divided doses 1 h before meals. After clinical and biochemical improvement or stabilization, zinc sulfate alone was administered as maintenance therapy. On treatment, the majority of patients (89.2%) had a favorable outcome and 3 patients died due to poor therapy compliance. No penicillamine-induced neurological deterioration was noted and adverse events were observed in <11% of patients throughout the follow-up period. Beneficial results on liver and neurological symptoms have been reported after extremely long-term treatment with a combination of low-dose D-penicillamine and high-dose zinc sulfate. Therefore, this regimen is an effective and safe treatment for children with WM.",,"Chang, H.;Xu, A.;Chen, Z.;Zhang, Y.;Tian, F.;Li, T.",2013,Apr,https://dx.doi.org/10.3892/etm.2013.971,0,0,
9,Brain delivery of zinc ions as a potential treatment for neurological disorders: mini-review,"Homeostasis of metal ions like Zn(2+) is essential for proper brain function. In addition, the list of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders involving dysregulation of brain Zn(2+) levels is long and growing, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, as well as schizophrenia, attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder, depression, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , Down syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Wilson's disease and Pick's disease. In addition, changes in Zn(2+) levels are seen in transient forebrain ischemia, seizures, traumatic brain injury, and alcoholism. Therefore, the ability to alter brain Zn(2+) levels becomes a new target for the prevention and treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases. Although the role of Zn(2+) in the brain has been extensively studied over the past few decades, methods for the controlled regulation and manipulation of Zn(2+) concentrations in the brain are still in their infancy. Because the use of dietary Zn(2+) supplementation and restriction has major limitations, new methods and alternative approaches are being explored, such as: B. Use of intracranial infusion of Zn(2+) chelators or nanoparticle technologies to increase or decrease intracellular Zn(2+) levels. Therefore, this review briefly summarizes the role of Zn(2+) in psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases and highlights the key findings and obstacles to manipulating Zn(2+) levels in the brain. In addition, some methods and compounds, such as B. Metal ion chelation, redistribution and supplementation used to control brain Zn(2+) levels for the treatment of brain disorders.",,"Grabrucker, A.

10,Copper dyshomeostasis in Wilson's disease and Alzheimer's disease as shown by serum and urine copper indicators,"Abnormal exposure to copper is the cause of Wilson's disease (WD), a rare condition characterized by elevated plasma levels of copper that are not bound to ceruloplasmin (nCp-Cu, also known as ""free"" copper). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), meta-analysis shows that copper decreases in the brain but increases in serum due to the increase in the nCp-Cu component. Despite the similarities, a direct comparison of the biological status of copper in the two diseases has never been made. To fill this gap, we evaluated serum copper, ceruloplasmin, nCp-Cu and Cu:Cp in 385 CE and 336 healthy controls previously screened and compared them to 9 newly diagnosed WM patients. We then examined the 24-hour urinary copper excretion in 24 WM patients on D-penicillamine (D-Pen) treatment and in 35 healthy controls and compared the results to those in AD patients participating in a previously published study Phase II clinical study with D-Pen. Adjusted for sex and age, serum nCp-Cu and Cu:Cp resulted in higher values in AD and WD than in healthy controls (both p<0.001). While nCp-Cu was similar between AD and WD, Cu:Cp was higher in WD (p<0.016). 24-hour urinary copper excretion was higher in AD patients (12.05 mg/day) than in healthy controls (4.82 mg/day; p<0.001). 77.8% of AD patients on D-Pen treatment had a 24-hour urinary output greater than 200 mg/day, indicating copper control failure. This study provides new insight into the pathophysiology of copper homeostasis in AD, demonstrating failure of copper control and the Cu:Cp ratio as a useful marker.",,"Squitti, R.;Ghidoni, R.;Simonelli, I.;Ivanova, I.

11,Einblicke in die Behandlung von Morbus Wilson,"Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism in which the causative gene ATP7B results in absent or reduced function of the ATP7B transporter, which is important for biliary copper excretion and copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin. Affected patients accumulate excess copper in the liver, brain, and other tissues. A condition affecting mainly children, adolescents and young adults; Clinical features range from the asymptomatic state to chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and is based on a combination of clinical signs, biochemical tests, hepatic copper assay and ATP7B gene mutation analysis; To date, there are more than 500 mutations of ATP7B in patients with Wilson's disease. Early detection and treatment can lead to an excellent prognosis, while untreated disease is almost always fatal. Drug therapies include chelating agents such as penicillamine or trientine and zinc salts. Liver transplantation is curative, corrects the underlying pathophysiology, and is traditionally indicated for acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease unresponsive to medical therapy.

13,"Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate in patients with Wilson's disease: an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study","BACKGROUND: Wilson disease is a genetic disorder in which copper accumulates in the liver, brain, and other tissues. Therapies are limited by efficacy, safety concerns, and multiple daily dosing. Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (WTX101) is an oral copper-protein binding molecule in its class that targets hepatic intracellular copper and reduces plasma non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) by forming tripartite complexes with albumin and increasing biliary copper excretion. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in the initial or early treatment of patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: We conducted this open-label phase 2 study at 11 hospitals in the US and Europe. We included patients (>=18 years) with Wilson's disease who were untreated or had not been treated with chelating agents or zinc for more than 24 months, had a Leipzig score of 4 or more and NCC concentrations above the lower limit of normal had a reference range (>=0.8 µmol/L). Eligible patients received WTX101 monotherapy at a starting dose of 15-60 mg/day based on baseline NCC concentrations for the first 4-8 weeks, with response-guided individualized dosing for the remaining weeks through week 24. Investigators, other hospital staff, and patients were aware of the identity of the treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in baseline NCC levels corrected for copper in tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin complexes (NCC<sub>corrected</sub>) at 24 weeks, with treatment response measured as achieving or maintaining a normalized NCC<sub> corrected< is defined as /sub> (<=2.3 mumol/L [upper limit of normal]) or achieving at least a 25% reduction in NCC <sub>corrected</sub> from baseline at 24 weeks. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under number NCT02273596. RESULTS: Between November 24, 2014 and April 27, 2016, 28 patients were enrolled and received WTX101; Twenty-two (79%) patients completed the study by week 24. At week 24, 20 (71%, 95% CI 51.3-86.8; p<0.0001) of 28 patients met criteria for treatment success: 16 ( 57%) treated with WTX101 achieved or maintained normalized NCC<sub>corrected</sub> concentrations and 4 (14%) had at least a 25% reduction from baseline NCC<sub>corrected</sub> levels. Mean NCC<sub>corrected</sub> was reduced by 72% from baseline to week 24 (least squares mean difference -2.4 µmol/L [SE 0.4], 95% CI -3.2 to -1.6; p<0.0001). No cases of paradoxical drug-related neurological deterioration were recorded. Liver function was stable in all patients, although 11 (39%) of 28 patients receiving at least 30 mg/day experienced reversible elevations of asymptomatic alanine or aspartate aminotransferase or gamma-glutamyltransferase in the absence of elevated bilirubin. 11 serious adverse events were reported in seven (25%) patients and included psychiatric disorders (six events in four patients), gait disturbances (one event), increased hepatic aminotransferases (two events in two patients, one with agranulocytosis) and decrease in Liver function Neurological function (an event probably due to a natural history of the disease, although causality could not be excluded). The seven serious adverse events, categorized as psychiatric disorders and a gait disorder, were considered unlikely to be related to the study drug, while the remaining four events were possibly or probably related. INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that WTX101 could be a promising new therapeutic approach for Wilson's disease with a unique mode of action. Given its once-daily dosing and favorable safety profile, WTX101 could improve the management of patients with this debilitating condition. FUNDING: Wilson Therapeutics AB.",,"Weiss, K. H.;Askari, F.

15,Bioavailable trace metals in neurological diseases,"OPINION: Medical treatment for Wilson's disease includes chelators (D-penicillamine and trientine) or zinc salts, which must be maintained for life. This pharmacological treatment is divided into two phases; the first is a decoppering phase and the second is a maintenance phase. The best therapeutic approach remains controversial, as few uncontrolled studies have compared these treatments. During the initial phase, a stepwise increase in chelating agent doses, adjusted for exchangeable copper and urinary copper, might help avoid neurological deterioration. Liver transplantation is indicated in acute fulminant liver failure and decompensated cirrhosis; in the case of neurological deterioration, this must be discussed individually. During the maintenance phase, the main challenge is to achieve good adherence to lifelong drug therapy. Neurodegenerative diseases that lead to mislocalization of iron can be caused by a culmination of localized overload (prooxidative siderosis) and localized deficiency (metabolic disorder). A new therapeutic concept involving conservative iron chelation rescues iron-overloaded neurons by scavenging labile iron and allows iron redistribution by delivering this chelated metal to endogenous apo-transferrin to avoid systemic iron loss.",,"Poujois, A.;Devedjian, J.

16,Early onset of Wilson's disease: diagnostic challenges,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze the clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of patients aged <= 5 years with early onset Wilson's disease (WD). Methods: Data from 143 pediatric patients with WM treated at our center between January 1996 and November 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: A review of 143 pediatric patients with WM identified 21 (10 girls, 11 boys) with onset symptoms or abnormal liver function test results aged <= 5 years. The diagnosis of WM was confirmed in 8 patients less than 5 years of age. At baseline, the mean serum alanine aminotransferase level was 222 U/L and the mean serum aspartate aminotransferase level was 130 U/L. The mean serum ceruloplasmin concentration in 16 patients tested was < 20 mg/dl. Of the 15 patients who underwent a urinary copper excretion test, 8 had values between 40 and 100 µg/day, with only 4 having values >100 µg/day. Copper quantification in the liver was > 250 µg/g dry weight in 16 patients. The most common mutation was p.H1069Q, with composite heterozygosity in 5 patients and homozygosity in 9. 16 patients were treated with zinc salts and 5 with D-penicillamine. Both treatments were effective with no serious side effects observed after 3 to 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: WD can present as early as 2 years of age. Because biochemical tests may be less sensitive in very young children, diagnosis may require a combination of tests. If molecular tests are inconclusive, liver copper levels should be measured.",,"Wiernicka, A.;Dadalski, M.;Janczyk, W.;Kaminska, D.;Naorniakowska, M.;Husing-Kabar, A.;Schmidt, H.;Socha, P.",2017,Nov,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0000000000001700,0,1,
17,Wilson's disease: Probable developments towards new therapies,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. A clear demand for novel WD treatment strategies has emerged. Although zinc salt and copper chelator therapies can be effective in curing WM, these drugs have limitations in a sizeable pool of WM patients who develop intolerance and/or severe side effects. Several research directions have revealed an intriguing potential for novel strategies and targets for the development of new therapies. Here we review these new approaches, which include correcting ATP7B mutants and discovering new compounds that bypass ATP7B deficiency, as well as cell and gene therapies. We also discuss if and when these new therapeutic strategies will be advanced to clinical application, according to key clinical trial requirements that have yet to be met. In conclusion, we discuss the hope that the currently rapidly evolving research on the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of WM and related potential therapeutic targets will provide a solid foundation for the next generation of WM therapies leading to an effective , tolerable and safe healing.",,"Ranucci, G.;Polishchuck, R.;Iorio, R.",2017,2014-08-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v23.i30.5451,0,0,
18,Dietary supplements associated with fulminant hepatic failure in a well-controlled patient with Wilson's disease,"We encountered a patient with previously well-controlled Wilson's disease who experienced fulminant hepatic failure with hemolytic anemia possibly caused by the dietary supplement Health Proportion() (Jubilant Co., Ltd., Ehime, Japan). A 21-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with marked hepatic dysfunction and severe hemolytic anemia. The free serum copper level was increased to 101 µg/dl and the urinary copper excretion was extremely increased (25,600 µg/day). Plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration were performed to remove serum copper and treat the hemolytic anemia. However, liver function did not improve and she underwent liver transplantation on day 28 after admission. Copper and iron levels in the resected liver were high at 851.9 µg and 551.7 µg/liver dry weight (g), respectively, although the patient had been taking D-penicillamine regularly since diagnosis and had well-controlled copper levels a year before admission had . Two months prior to admission, the patient had been taking a soybean dietary supplement for 1 month. This dietary supplement was labeled as being high in copper and iron and we believe this caused fulminant hepatic failure with hemolytic crisis in this patient. It is important to pay attention to the micronutrient content of dietary supplements, especially for patients with metabolic disorders.",,"Kawai, K.;Atarashi, Y.;Takahara, T.;Kudo, H.;Tajiri, K.;Tokimitsu, Y.;Nakayama, Y.;Hirano, K.;Yata, Y.;Minemura, M.;Yasumura, S.;Onishi, Y.;Tsukada, K.;Tsuneyama, K.;Takano, Y.;Sugiyama, T.",2009,Apr,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12328-008-0056-6,0,0,
19,Chemosensitivity of U251 cells to D-penicillamine and copper co-treatment: potential implications for patients with Wilson's disease,"D-penicillamine (PA), a copper chelator and one of the recommended drugs to treat Wilson's disease (WD), has been reported to worsen symptoms in patients with neurological presentations. However, the cause of this paradoxical reaction is not yet fully understood and requires further investigation. Accordingly, we examined the in vitro effect of copper (Cu) and/or PA treatment on human glioblastoma U251 cells as an in vitro model of Cu cytotoxicity. Treatment of U251 cells with either Cu or PA had no significant effect on their morphology, viability, or ROS concentration. In contrast, co-treatment with Cu-PA caused a decrease in viability, altered glutathione and ceruloplasmin expression associated with a marked increase in ROS; depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential; and an increase in sub-G0 phase; along with alpha-fodrin proteolysis. These findings together with the lack of LDH release in these assays suggest that combined Cu-PA exposure induced apoptosis in U251 cells. In addition, pre/or concomitant treatment with antioxidants showed a protective effect, with catalase being more effective than N-acetylcysteine or Trolox in restoring viability and reducing the levels of ROS generated. In comparison, a similar analysis using other cell lines showed that rat PC12 cells were resistant to Cu and/or PA treatment, while the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was sensitive to either compound alone, resulting in reduced viability and increased ROS levels. Taken together, this study demonstrates that glioblastoma U251 cells represent a model for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> mediated cytotoxicity of Cu-PA. We postulate that PA oxidation in the presence of Cu yields H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which in turn penetrates the plasma membrane and induces apoptosis. However, other cell lines showed different responses to these treatments and may have provided a model for cell-type specific cytotoxic responses in the nervous system. The sensitivity of different neural and glial cell types to Cu-PA treatment may therefore underlie the neurological deterioration seen in some PA-treated WM patients. Our results also indicate that the side effects of PA treatment could be reduced or prevented by the administration of antioxidants.",,"Katerji, M.;Barada, K.;Jomaa, M.;Kobeissy, F.;Makkawi, A.

20,Is high serum copper concentration a risk factor for implantation failure?,"BACKGROUND: Copper-containing contraceptives can deposit copper ions in the endometrium, leading to implantation failure. Deposition of copper ions in many organs has been reported in patients with untreated Wilson's disease. Because these patients sometimes exhibit subfertility and/or early pregnancy loss, it has also been suggested that copper ions accumulate in the uterine dotrium. Patients with Wilson's disease treated with zinc successfully delivered babies because zinc interfered with the absorption of copper from the gastrointestinal tract. These findings led to the hypothesis that implantation failure may occur in infertile patients with high serum copper concentrations due to excessive accumulation of copper ions. The relationship between implantation rates (pregnancy rates) and serum copper concentrations has not been studied. The Japanese government recently stated that actual copper intake among the Japanese is higher than required. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether serum copper concentrations are related to implantation rates (pregnancy rates) of human embryos in vivo. METHODS: We included 269 patients (age < 40 years old) undergoing vitrifying and warming single embryo transfer with a hormone replacement cycle using good blastocysts (3BB or more according to Gardner classification). Serum hCG, copper and zinc concentrations were measured 16 days after the first date of progesterone replacement. We compared 96 women who were 10 weeks pregnant without miscarriage (group P) and 173 women who were not pregnant (group NP). RESULTS: No significant differences in age or BMI were observed between groups. Copper concentrations were significantly higher in group NP (mean 193.2 µg/dl) than in group P (mean 178.1 µg/dl). According to the area under the curve (AUC) on the receiver operating curve used to predict clinical pregnancy rates, the Cu/Zn ratio (AUC 0.64, 95% CI 0.54-0.71) was a better predictor than copper or zinc. When we set the Cu/Zn ratio cutoff at 1.59/1.60, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.98, 0.29, 0.71, and 0.88, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our single-center retrospective study indicates that high serum copper concentrations (high Cu/Zn ratio) are a risk factor for implantation failure.",,"Matsubayashi, H.;Kitaya, K.;Yamaguchi, K.;Nishiyama, R.;Takaya, Y.;Ishikawa, T.",2017,2010-08-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13104-017-2708-4,0,0,

22,Inherited disorders of transition metal metabolism: an update,"Elements with a biological role include six trace transition metals: manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, zinc, and molybdenum. Transition metals are involved in group transfer reactions such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, and those that can transfer an electron by switching between two redox states such as iron (3+/2+) and copper (2+/1+) are also very important in biology Redox reactions including molecular oxygen reduction and oxygen transport. However, these trace metals are also potentially toxic and generate reactive oxygen species through Fenton chemistry. A role for trace metals in host defense (""nutritional immunity"") has recently been recognized. The host can deprive the pathogen of a trace metal or poison it with a toxic concentration. Disorders that result in low levels of a trace metal can often be treated by supplementing that metal; Disorders that result in levels that are too high can often be treated with chelating agents such as penicillamine and edetate disodium. This update addresses: i) the manganese/zinc transporters (as two new treatable diseases were described in 2016 - SLC39A8 deficiency and SLC39A14 deficiency); ii) copper transporter disorders because we need to improve the treatment of patients with neurological symptoms due to Wilson's disease; and iii) iron homeostasis, as recent advances in the understanding of iron metabolism and its regulation are helping us to better understand several innate errors affecting these metabolic pathways.",,"Clayton, P.

23,Wilson's disease in childhood: Perspective from Bangladesh,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects copper metabolism and causes copper-induced damage to various organs. In children, the liver is often involved. The central nervous system, eyes, erythrocytes, kidneys, brain and bones can also be affected. The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical and laboratory profile of Wilson's disease in children. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2011 to December 2013 at the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh. One hundred consecutive children of MV between the ages of 3 and 18 years were evaluated for their clinical and biochemical profile. The average age of the children examined was 8.5 +/- 1.5 years. The male-female ratio was 2:1. Ninety-one percent of the patients were Muslim and nine percent were Hindu. Blood relationship was established in 30% of cases. Seven parents were first cousins. 15% of patients had a family history of chronic liver disease. Most (53%) cases of hepatic WM occurred between the ages of 5 and 10 years, and most neurological WM manifested in the 10 to 15 year age group. Of 100 patients with WD, 69 children presented with hepatic manifestations only, 6 with neurological manifestations only, 14 with both hepatic and neurological manifestations, 10 children were asymptomatic, and 1 patient with psychiatric features. WD presented as chronic liver disease (CLD) in 42% of cases, CLD with portal hypertension in 34% of cases, acute hepatitis in 20% of cases, and fulminant liver failure in 4% of cases. Stigmas of chronic liver disease were found in 18% of patients. The most common stigmata were thenar and hypothenar wasting (n=8). The Keizer-Fleischser ring (KF ring) was found in 76% of all patients. The KF ring was present in 84% (58 of 69) of purely hepatic Wilson patients and in 90% (18 of 20) of all neurological Wilson patients. Asymptomatic and psychiatric patient had no KF ring. About 26% of WD patients had Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia in PBF. Most WM patients had altered liver function. Elevated serum transaminase was found in 85% of all cases, prolonged prothrombin time in 59% of cases, and low serum albumin in 53% of cases. 73% of patients had low serum ceruloplasmin, basal urinary copper of > 100 mg/day was found in 81% of cases, and post-penicillamine challenge urinary copper of > 1200 mg/day was found in 92% of cases. In 28 cases with hepatic presentation, esophageal varices were identified by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. WM patients with hepatic presentations received zinc sulfate along with penicillamine. All patients with neurological manifestations as well as asymptomatic cases were kept on zinc therapy. WD is a treatable metabolic cause of liver disease. The majority of WD children studied presented with hepatic manifestations, of which 76% presented with CLD. Any child presenting with jaundice after the age of 3 years should be evaluated for WD.",,"Rukunuzzaman, M.;Karim, A. B.;Nurullah, M.;Sultana, F.;Mazumder, M. W.;Rahman, M. A.;Billah, S.

24,Sip-1 mutations cause disturbances in the activity of NMDA and AMPA but not kainate receptors of neurons in the cerebral cortex,"Smad-interacting protein-1 (Sip1) [Zinc finger homeobox (Zfhx1b), Zeb2] is a transcription factor involved in the development of Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) in humans. MWS is a rare genetic autosomal dominant disease caused by a mutation in the Sip1 gene (also known as Zeb2 or Zfhx1b) mapped to the 2q22.3 locus. MWS affects 1 in 50-100 newborns worldwide. It is characterized by mental retardation, short stature, typical facial changes and developmental disorders of the cardiovascular and kidney systems and some other organs. Sip1 mutations cause abnormal neurogenesis in the brain during development and susceptibility to epileptic seizures. In the current study, we examined the role of the Sip1 gene in the activity of NMDA, AMPA and KA receptors. We have shown that a specific mouse Sip1 mutation causes changes in the activity of both NMDA and AMPA receptors in neocortical neurons in vitro. We show that neocortical neurons that have only one copy of Sip1 (heterozygous, Sip1<sup>fI/wt</sup>) are more sensitive to both NMDA and AMPA receptor agonists compared to wild-type neurons (Sip1< sup >wt/wt</sup>). This is reflected in higher amplitudes of agonist-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals as well as a lower half-maximal effective concentration (IEC50). In contrast, neurons from homozygous Sip1 mice (Sip1<sup>fI/fI</sup>) show higher resistance to these respective receptor agonists. This is reflected in lower amplitudes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, requiring a higher concentration of receptor activators for activation.

25,New perspectives on the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive copper overload disorder that causes hepatic and neurological symptoms. Current drug therapy has shown satisfactory results in liver disease, but limited effects in neurologically affected patients. Several new therapeutic options have been developed in recent years, showing promising results that could improve the management of Wilson's disease in the near future. An optimization of the treatment schemes depending on the biochemical reaction pattern seems to make sense, especially in the decoppering phase of the therapy. The chelator tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a promising therapy option that is currently being clinically investigated. TTM is a fast-acting and very potent chelating agent and appears to be less associated with early neurological deterioration after initiation of therapy than currently used drugs. Treatment with non-chelating drugs, which feature alternative modes of action, is currently being studied but has so far been limited to animal or in vitro studies. This includes fundamental research studies that provide evidence for successful cell or gene therapy in Wilson's disease in order to restore sufficient biliary copper excretion before the onset of the disease.

26,Symptomatic treatment of neurological symptoms in Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is a potentially treatable neurodegenerative disease. In most cases, treatment with drugs that induce negative copper balance (usually chelating agents or zinc salts) results in improvement in liver function and neurological symptoms. However, some patients present with severe neurological symptoms such as tremor, dystonia, parkinsonism and chorea at diagnosis. In this patient population, some neurological deficits may persist despite appropriate treatment, and further neurological deterioration may be observed after initiation of treatment. Such patients may need additional treatment to relieve neurological symptoms. Aside from general recommendations for anticopper treatment in WM, there are currently no guidelines for treating neurological symptoms in WM. The aim of this chapter is to summarize possible treatments for neurological symptoms in WM based on the currently available medical literature.

27,Wilson's disease - currently used anti-copper therapy,"Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that can be successfully treated with pharmacological treatment. Two groups of drugs are currently used: chelators (eg, D-penicillamine and trientine), which increase urinary copper excretion, and zinc salts, which inhibit copper absorption in the digestive tract. The mechanisms of action result in a negative copper balance, stopping the pathological accumulation of copper in tissues and relieving affected organs of copper overload. Due to the lack of prospective clinical trials, the use of drugs mainly depends on the experience of the centers and the accessibility in different countries or regions. This chapter presents the various reports and recommendations on WM treatment. In addition to the different expert opinions on pharmacological agents, there are some axioms for WM treatment: Even in clinically pre-symptomatic cases, treatment should start immediately after diagnosis; the patient should be treated for life, making compliance a key factor in treatment success; and treatment should be monitored regularly by liver and haematological tests, neurological examinations, and copper metabolism, and treatment adjusted accordingly. Other drugs proposed for WM treatment (eg, tetrathiomolybdate) are in clinical trials and current recommendations are lacking. Therefore, only the currently available options for the pharmacological treatment of WM are discussed.

28,Wilson disease in children,"Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder primarily of hepatocellular copper disposition due to dysfunction of Wilson's ATPase, a P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPase encoded by the gene ATP7B. In children, as well as in older age groups, the clinical picture is very diverse. Although liver disease is the most common manifestation in children/adolescents, neurological, psychiatric, and hematological clinical manifestations occur. Very young children may have clinically evident liver disease due to WM. Early diagnosis, preferably when the child/adolescent is asymptomatic, is most likely to result in near-normal longevity in generally good health, as long as the patient is tolerating effective medication, adhering to the lifelong treatment regimen, and having continued access to medication. In addition to a lively clinical index of suspicion on the part of physicians, biochemical tests, including liver tests, serum ceruloplasmin and basal 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and genotyping are key to the diagnosis. Oral chelation remains the focus of medical management, although zinc appears to be an attractive option for the pre-symptomatic child. Pediatric patients with fulminant Wilson's liver failure must be differentiated from those with decompensated cirrhosis, as the latter may respond to intensive care interventions and may not require liver transplantation.

31,One-step synthesis of amine-functionalized mesoporous magnetite nanoparticles and their application to remove copper ions from aqueous solutions,"Amine-functionalized mesoporous superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles with an average size of 70 nm were synthesized using a one-step solvothermal method through the introduction of triethylenetetramine (TETA), a chelating agent recommended for removing excess copper in patients with Wilson's disease. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm, vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It was confirmed that the magnetic nanoparticles were functionalized with TETA during the synthesis process and the concentration of TETA is crucial for the formation of monodisperse mesoporous nanoparticles. The obtained single-crystal magnetic nanoparticles exhibit high magnetization, which enhances their response to an external magnetic field and should therefore greatly facilitate the manipulation of the particles in practical applications. Reaction parameters affecting the formation of mesoporous structures were studied and a possible formation mechanism involving templated aggregation and recrystallization processes was proposed. The capacity of the synthesized amine-functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles for Cu(II) removal from aqueous solution was investigated. The adsorption rate of Cu(II) on amine-functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The results of this study indicated that the amine-functionalized Fe3O4 mesoporous superparamagnetic nanoparticles could be used as an efficient adsorbent in water treatment and would also find a potential application for Cu(II) removal in vivo.

33,Fast and reliable diagnosis of Wilson's disease using X-ray fluorescence,"Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease resulting from mutations in the gene encoding the copper transporter ATP7B. Diagnosis is complicated by the variability of symptoms induced by copper accumulation, the inconsistency of pathognomonic signs, and the lack of a reliable diagnostic test. We investigated the diagnostic potential of X-ray fluorescence (XRF), which allows quantitative analysis of multiple elements. Studies were performed in animal models using Wistar rats (n=10) and Long Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats (n=11) and human specimens including normal livers (n=10), alcoholic cirrhosis (n=8), Hemochromatosis (n=10), cholestasis (n=6) and WD (n=22). XRF experiments were first performed using synchrotron radiation to study elemental composition at the cellular level. High-resolution mapping of tissue sections allowed measuring the intensity and distribution of copper, iron and zinc while maintaining morphology. Further investigations were carried out using a laboratory X-ray source to irradiate whole pieces of tissue. The sensitivity of XRF was highlighted by distinguishing wild-type LEC rats, even when treated with a diet low in copper. XRF on whole formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded needle biopsies allowed the elements to be profiled in minutes. The intensity of copper relative to iron and zinc significantly differentiated WD from other genetic or chronic liver diseases with a specificity of 97.6% and a sensitivity of 100%. This study established a definitive diagnosis of Wilson's disease based on XRF. This fast and versatile method can be easily implemented in a clinical setting.",,"Kascakova, S.;Kewish, C.

The diagnosis of Wilson disease and its ongoing monitoring is challenging when it is associated with an underlying kidney disease such as Alport syndrome. Proteinuria can lead to low ceruloplasmin, as it is one of the serum proteins that are inappropriately filtered by the damaged glomerulus, and can also lead to increased urinary loss of heavy metals such as zinc and copper. Elevated transaminases may be attributed to dyslipidemia or drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Accurate diagnosis of Wilson's disease is essential for targeted therapy and improved prognosis.

35,Metal pathways to Alzheimer's disease: Lessons from genetic copper trade disorders,"Copper is an essential metal ion that confers catalytic function on numerous enzymes and also regulates neurotransmission and intracellular signaling. Conversely, a copper deficiency or excess can lead to chronic diseases in humans. Menkes' disease and Wilson's disease are two rare inherited copper transport disorders characterized by copper deficiency and copper overload, respectively. Changes in copper status are also a common feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In the case of AD, which is characterized by copper deficiency in the brain, changes in copper distribution have been linked to different aspects of the disease process; Protein aggregation, defective protein breakdown, oxidative stress, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although AD is a multifactorial disease likely caused by a breakdown in multiple cellular signaling pathways, copper and other metal ions such as iron and zinc play central roles in many of these cellular processes. Pioneering work by researchers studying relatively rare copper transport diseases has shed light on potential metal ion-related disease mechanisms in other forms of neurodegeneration such as AD.",,"Greenough, M.

36,Clinical efficacy of combined treatment with sodium dimercaptopropane sulfonate and zinc in neurological Wilson's disease with treatment failure with D-penicillamine,"OBJECTIVES: There are limited pharmacological treatments for patients with neurological Wilson disease (WD) and a history of copper chelation treatment failure. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical records of 38 patients with WD treated with sodium dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS) and zinc (group 1) or zinc alone (group 2). All patients had a history of neurological deterioration during their previous treatment with D-penicillamine (DPA). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were treated with DMPS intravenously for 4 weeks followed by zinc gluconate for 6 months, and the treatment protocol was repeated twice. Relative to baseline, repeated DMPS therapy and zinc maintenance therapy continuously reduced neurological scores (p<0.01). Sixteen patients (76.2%) showed neurological improvements after 1 year of therapy and four patients (19.0%) showed neurological deterioration at the follow-up session. In addition, 17 patients were treated with zinc monotherapy for 12 months. Two patients (11.8%) showed neurological improvement and five patients (29.4%) showed neurological deterioration. Compared to patients in group 2, a greater ratio of improvement (p<0.01) and a lower ratio of deterioration (p<0.01) were observed in patients in group 1 after 1 year of therapy.

40,Controversies and differences in the diagnosis and treatment of children with Wilson's disease: results from an international survey,"OBJECTIVES: Variation in care is more common in settings where evidence-based approaches are limited. The aim of the present study was to describe the consensus and variability of approaches used by pediatric hepatologists in the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD) in children. METHOD: International case-centered, internet-based survey of pediatric hepatologists. Survey cases were developed in consensus among the authors to identify differences in care for children with WM. RESULTS: One hundred and eleven of 253 physicians responded (44%). Of these, 84% of North American and 41% of European participants used guidelines published in their respective regions. Although there was consensus on the first-line diagnostic tools (serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper excretion at baseline), survey participants disagreed on how much hepatic copper content is required for diagnosis: 57% considered >250 µg/ g dry weight for agree with WD, while 25% considered >50 µg/g as diagnostic. Overall, 50% of physicians perform genetic testing on all suspected cases, and 81% perform genetic testing once they know an index patient's genotype. For first-line treatment for fulminant WM, 51% of participants chose chelation and 15% immediate transplantation; 47% elected to be listed for transplantation, followed by monitoring using a disease severity score, and then proceeded with transplantation only when the score reached a critical threshold. To treat mildly affected siblings of index patients, 43% of physicians chose zinc. Most reported using chelation to treat patients with liver dysfunction; However, 29% of North American participants chose not to use D-penicillamine as their first-line therapy. CONCLUSIONS: From an international perspective, pediatric hepatologists differ in the approaches they use in the care of children with WM. Regional preferences and accessibility to treatments may result in variations. However, unjustified fluctuations can also contribute to differences in the outcome and should be used in a targeted manner to improve the quality of care.",,"Sturm, E.;Piersma, F. E.;Tanner, M.

42,Wilson's Disease: A Review of What We Learned,"Wilson disease (WD), resulting from the defective ATP7B protein product, is characterized by impaired copper metabolism and its clinical consequences vary from an asymptomatic state to fulminant liver failure, chronic liver disease with or without cirrhosis, neurological and psychiatric manifestations. A high degree of suspicion is warranted in order not to miss cases of WD, particularly less florid cases with only mild elevations in transaminases or isolated neuropsychiatric involvement. Screening of first and second relatives of index cases is mandatory, and treatment must begin upon establishment of the diagnosis. Treatment strategies include chelators such as D-penicillamine and trientine, while zinc salts act as inducers of methallothioneins that promote negative copper balance and a reduction in plasma free copper. As a rare disease, there is a lack of research in this area, particularly in relation to therapeutic strategies associated with better patient compliance, which could potentially also reverse established injuries.",,"Rodriguez-Castro, K.

Although the literature shows successful outcomes after appropriate treatment, pregnant patients with Wilson's disease still require close monitoring and management. Here we report the case of a successful pregnancy in a Korean woman with Wilson's disease. A 33-year-old woman with a first birth with Wilson's disease visited our maternity hospital. She had stopped taking her medication 2 years earlier of her own accord. Oral zinc oxide therapy was started and closely monitored throughout the pregnancy.

45,"Zebrafish in the sea of mineral metabolism (iron, zinc and copper).","Iron, copper, zinc and eight other minerals are classified as essential trace elements because they occur in minute amounts in vivo and are essential to life. Because both excess and deficiency of trace minerals can be life-threatening (and can cause human diseases such as iron deficiency anemia, hemochromatosis, Menkes syndrome, and Wilson's disease), endogenous levels of trace minerals must be tightly regulated. Many studies have demonstrated the existence of systems that maintain trace element homeostasis, and these systems are highly conserved in several species, from yeast to mice. As a model for investigating trace element metabolism, the zebrafish is indispensable for research. Several large-scale mutagenesis screens have been performed in zebrafish, and these screens resulted in the identification of a number of metal transporters and the generation of several mutagenesis lines that allow for in-depth system-level functional analysis. In addition, due to their developmental advantages, zebrafish have also been used in chemical screens and toxicological studies related to mineral metabolism. Here we systematically review the key results of trace element homeostasis studies using the zebrafish model with a focus on iron, zinc, copper, selenium, manganese and iodine. We also offer a homology analysis of trace element transporters in fish, mice and humans. Finally, we discuss the evidence that zebrafish are an ideal experimental tool for unveiling novel mechanisms of trace element metabolism and improving approaches to treating diseases related to mineral imbalances.",,"Zhao, L.;Xia, Z.;Wang, F.",2014,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2014.00033,0,0,
46,A review and current perspective on Wilson disease,"Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism and may be more common when consanguinity is predominant. Much is known about the disease, having first been described as ""progressive lenticular degeneration"" by Kinnier Wilson in 1912. Over 500 mutations of the ATP7B gene have been identified with no clear correlation between genotype and phenotype. Loss of ATP7B function results in varying degrees of reduced biliary excretion of copper and reduced incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin; The accumulation and toxicity of copper in the liver, brain and other tissues leads to liver toxicity and other myriad manifestations of the disease. Clinical features can vary from an asymptomatic state to chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, neuropsychiatric manifestations, and hemolytic anemia. Diagnosis is based on the combination of clinical signs, biochemical features, histological findings, and mutational analysis of the ATP7B gene. There are subtle geographic differences, with a disproportionate proportion of children presenting with acute liver failure. A high index of suspicion is required for early diagnosis. The ratios of biochemical indices for early detection need to be validated in all geographic regions and may not be particularly applicable to children. Better biomarkers or the need for tests for early detection of ALF persist. Drugs used in the treatment of Wilson's disease include copper chelating agents such as d-penicillamine, trientine, and zinc salt. Left untreated, Wilson's disease regularly leads to death from liver disease or severe neurological disability. Early detection and treatment has an excellent prognosis. Liver transplantation is indicated in acute liver failure and end-stage liver disease. Family screening to detect the disease in first-degree relatives is warranted. This review provides an overview of various aspects of Wilson's disease, including geographic differences in presentation and clinical management, and the limitations of currently available testing.",,"Patil, M.;Sheth, K.

47,Biometals in rare childhood neurodegenerative diseases,"Copper, iron and zinc are just three of the most important biometals that are critical to the proper functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). They play diverse roles in many functional processes including but not limited to enzyme catalysis, protein stabilization, and energy production. The range of metal concentrations in the body is tightly regulated, and when the balance is disturbed, debilitating effects occur. The homeostasis of biometals in the brain is mainly controlled by various metal transporters and metal-binding proteins. The biological role of biometals is well documented in the literature, with a strong focus on the connection to neurological disorders associated with aging. Biometals are also implicated in a variety of debilitating hereditary diseases of childhood, some of which appear shortly after birth or in the child's early adulthood. This review article aims to highlight what we know about biometals in childhood neurological disorders such as Wilson disease (WD), Menkes disease (MD), neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). Also, some of the animal models available to determine the pathological mechanisms in these childhood diseases are discussed, which we hope will aid our understanding of the role of biometals in disease and the development of potential therapeutics in the future.",,"Parker, S.

49,Refractory rickets due to Fanconi syndrome secondary to Wilson's disease,"Renal tubular disease is an important cause of refractory rickets. Wilson's disease, an inherited disorder of copper metabolism, has different manifestations. We present a case of refractory rickets due to Fanconi syndrome secondary to Wilson disease. An adolescent girl presented with hip and knee joint pain and a knock-knee deformity for six years. She had been given multiple doses of cholecalciferol with little improvement. There was no family history of seizures, polyuria, jaundice, use of medication, or similar conditions. Physical examination revealed severe short stature with wrist extension and genu valgum. Central nervous system (CNS) examination was normal. Skeletal radiographs showed features suggestive of rickets at the hip and knee joints. Routine biochemistry was normal, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was adequate (57.1 ng/dL), with normal corrected calcium (9.24 mg/dL), low phosphate (2.76 mg/dL ), increased bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and normal renal function. 24-hour urine showed phosphaturia, kaliuresis, and glucosuria with normal blood sugars and aminoaciduria. Blood gas analysis revealed normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with a urine pH of 7. Ammonium chloride (NH4CL) challenge revealed proximal tubular acidosis. A search for the cause revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was confirmed by low serum ceruloplasmin levels (6.5 mg/dL; normal: 18-35 mg/dL) with high 24-hour urinary copper levels (433 mcg; normal: 20-50 mcg). . She was started on replacement of alkali, phosphate, calcium and vitamin D with zinc acetate for Wilson's disease. Rickets, a typical feature of Wilson's disease, has been rarely reported.

CASE PRESENTATION: We described the case of an Indian male with a history of polydipsia and polyuria associated with hypercalciuria and resulting nephrocalcinosis. Symptoms began at age five, but he was not diagnosed with WD until he reached adolescence. We began therapy with D-penicillamine, B vitamin complex and recommended a low-copper diet. Kidney involvement in Wilson's disease, characterized by hypercalciuria, was first reported by Litin in 1959. CONCLUSION: Our case was different and peculiar from the previously described cases as the patient had a very long history (10 years) of permanent hypercalciuria without an acute episode of nephrolithiasis.",,"Di Stefano, V.;Lionetti, E.;Rotolo, N.;La Rosa, M.;Leonardi, S.",2012,Aug,https://dx.doi.org/10.5812/hepatmon.6233,0,0,
52,Penicillamine neurotoxicity: a hypothesis,"Penicillamine, dimethylcysteine, and thiovalin remain the drug of choice for treating patients with Wilson's disease. It is also useful in the treatment of cysteinuria and rheumatoid arthritis, and has also been suggested to be useful in the treatment of other rare diseases. It also has multiple toxicities. Most of these can be explained in terms of chemical toxicity, for example its weak antipyridoxine activity and its ability to interfere with lysyl oxide, leading to skin lesions. More important is its ability to trigger immune responses such as SLE, immune complex nephritis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Goodpasture syndrome. However, the sudden increase in neurological symptoms that can occur in a small number of patients remains unexplained. The theory is proposed that this is due to a lethal synthesis. In susceptible patients, the SH radical is released from penicillamine and inhibits SH-dependent enzymes in the Krebs cycle, resulting in neuronal death. Other toxic metabolites can also be produced, such as methyl mercaptan and ethyl mercaptan, both of which could produce a similar metabolic blockade.",,"Walshe, J.

Evidence-Based Medicine: Having compiled the best available clinical evidence, I conclude that oral zinc therapy is a sound choice for the treatment of free copper toxicosis in individual patients with Alzheimer's disease. Hypothesis 1: Age-related free copper toxicosis is a causal factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. There are 2 neurodegenerative diseases with abnormalities in copper metabolism: (a) the juvenile form with degeneration of the basal ganglia (Wilson's disease) and (b) the age-related form with cortical neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's disease). Originally it was hypothesized that neurodegeneration was caused by the accumulation of copper in the brain, but later experience with the treatment of Wilson's disease led to the belief that free plasma copper is the toxic form of copper: it catalyzes and thereby produces amyloid formation oxidative stress, free radicals and degeneration of cortical neurons. Hypothesis 2: Oral zinc therapy is an effective and safe treatment for free copper toxicosis in Alzheimer's disease. Recommended dosage: 50 mg elemental zinc/day. Warning: Chelation therapy is irrational and dangerous in the treatment of copper toxicosis in Alzheimer's disease.",,"Hoogenraad, T. U.",2011,,https://dx.doi.org/10.4061/2011/492686,0,0,

A 4-year-old male patient underwent surgery for a traumatic cranial depression fracture and intracerebral hematoma. At the age of 2.5 years he was diagnosed with Wilson's disease and treated with zinc sulfate and D-penicillamine. General anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl, atracurium and maintained with isoflurane and oxygen. No complications occurred during the operation or in the postoperative period. We concluded that general anesthesia can be successfully administered to patients with Wilson's disease using an anesthetic whose metabolism is least affected by liver disease, one that produces the least liver toxicity.

PATIENT #ENTITYSTARTX00026; METHOD: A 34-year-old male patient with a history of hyperlipidemia was admitted with symptoms of abdominal pain and mild hematuria. Abnormal liver function tests, ultrasound reports, and liver biopsies suggested nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The patient received preliminary treatment for NASH. However, at subsequent follow-up, NASH remained unresolved and liver histology showed fibrosis progression from stage 1 to stage 3 fibrosis. RESULTS: Biochemical testing showed that serum ceruloplasmin levels were decreased (7 mg/dl), while urinary copper excretion increased (174.2 cups/day). Wilson's disease was confirmed by diagnostic mutational analysis using direct sequencing. Heterogeneity in the patient's ATP7B gene confirmed Wilson's disease. Administration of D-penicillamine resulted in a decrease in hepatic fat deposition and no further progression of fibrosis after 10 months.

58,Mania as a symptom of Wilson-Krankheit,"OBJECTIVE: Wilson's disease often presents with neurological or hepatic manifestations. If it presents only with psychiatric symptoms or with extrapyramidal symptoms secondary to neuroleptic exposure, the diagnosis of underlying Wilson disease may be missed. METHODS: An 18-year-old boy presented to the psychiatric hospital with a manic syndrome and a high predisposition to extrapyramidal symptoms on neuroleptics. Initial examination revealed splenomegaly and pancytopenia. The subsequent detection of the Kayser-Fleischer ring and typical biochemical findings confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. RESULTS: While psychiatric symptoms were controlled with lithium carbonate, extrapyramidal symptoms persisted after antipsychotic cessation. Pancytopenia, thought to be due to hypersplenism, persists and the patient has developed features of liver cirrhosis. Treatment with zinc and folic acid has been started and the patient is being evaluated for treatment with penicillamine. CONCLUSION: The psychiatrist must recognize that Wilson's disease can occasionally present with isolated psychiatric symptoms, including mania. Early and severe extrapyramidal symptoms following neuroleptic drug exposure in an adolescent age group warrant detailed investigation to rule out underlying neuropsychiatric disorders.",,"Chand, P.

RECENT RESULTS: There is new data on the structure and function of the protein responsible for Wilson disease, ATP7B, and the importance of its correct cellular localization in hepatocytes. Further new information on the continued use of zinc for the initial treatment of this disease in asymptomatic patients and the initial use of tetrathiomolybdate in neurologically affected patients will transform our future approach to treating patients with this disease. New guidelines for diagnosis and treatment have also been established. New data have also enhanced our understanding of hemochromatosis and iron overload disorders. Highlights this year include the discovery of a new gene involved in iron metabolism, hemojuvelin, and new data on the role of HFE mutations in the development of iron overload. Other data suggest that altered regulation of the peptide hepcidin may play a crucial role in the development of the iron overload phenotype in patients with hemochromatosis. For alpha-on-antitrypsin, new information on the occurrence of the disease in African populations is being collected and the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of the disease is being further explored.

60,Comparative study of biliary trace elements and clinical phenotypes in Wilson's disease,"AIM: To further explore the etiological mechanism of Wilson's disease (WD) by comparing changes in bile trace elements and their clinical phenotype. METHODS: WM patients of different types and conditions (n=20), non-WM patients with chronic liver damage (n=22), and healthy volunteers (n=10; used as controls) were studied. Bile duct samples were taken by duodenal drainage. An atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to analyze the copper and zinc content of each sample. RESULTS: In WM, bile copper content and copper/zinc ratio were apparently lower than in non-WM patients with chronic liver damage and healthy controls (F = 14.76, 25.4; 14.92, 26.2 and P<0.01, respectively). , while biliary zinc levels showed no significant difference from the two non-WD control groups (P > 0.05). There were significant differences in biliary copper excretion between patients with different types and conditions (F=3.75, P<0.05; F=6.20, P<0.01).

62,Zinc salts block hepatitis E virus replication by inhibiting the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute, self-limiting hepatitis in healthy individuals and chronic disease in immunocompromised individuals. HEV infection in pregnant women results in a more serious outcome, with mortality rates as high as 30%. Although the virus usually causes sporadic infections, epidemics have been reported in developing and resource-poor countries. There is no specific antiviral for HEV. A combination of interferon and ribavirin therapy has been used with some success to control the disease. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that plays a crucial role in several cellular processes. Zinc salts are known to be effective in reducing infections caused by few viruses. Here we examined the effect of zinc salts on HEV replication. In a culture model of human hepatoma cells (Huh7), zinc salts dose-dependently inhibited the replication of HEV genotype 1 (g-1) and g-3 replicons and g-1 HEV infectious genomic RNA. Analysis of a replication-defective mutant of g-1 HEV genomic RNA under similar conditions ruled out the possibility that zinc salts act on replication-independent processes. A g-1 HEV infection model based on an ORF4-Huh7 cell line further confirmed the above observations. Zinc salts had no effect on g-1 HEV entry into the host cell. Furthermore, our data indicate that zinc salts directly inhibit viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity, resulting in inhibition of viral replication. Taken together, these studies unravel the ability of zinc salts to inhibit HEV replication, suggesting their potential therapeutic value in controlling HEV infection due to frequent outbreaks. Due to its ability to cause acute and chronic infections in organ transplant recipients and immunocompromised individuals, it is also becoming a public health problem in developed countries. Although antivirals such as ribavirin have been used to treat HEV cases, there are known side effects and limitations of such therapy. Our discovery of the ability of zinc salts to block HEV replication through their ability to inhibit viral RdRp activity is important as these results pave the way to test the efficacy of zinc supplementation therapy in HEV-infected patients . Because zinc supplementation therapy is known to be safe in healthy individuals, and because high-dose zinc is used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, it may be possible to control HEV-associated health problems with a similar treatment regimen.",,"Kaushik, N.;Subramani, C.;Anang, S.;Muthumohan, R.;Shalimar;Nayak, B.;Ranjith-Kumar, C.

In the present study, an investigation was performed to evaluate the effects of heavy metal (HM) contamination on AMF status, soil properties, aggregate distribution and stability, and their correlations at different soil depths (0-10, 10-20, 20 - 30, 30-40cm). Our results showed that mycorrhizal colonization (MC), hyphal length density (HLD), GRSP, soil organic matter (SOM), and soil organic carbon (SOC) were significantly inhibited by Pb compared to Zn at 0-20 cm soil depth, which suggesting that HM had significant inhibitory effects on AMF growth and soil properties, and that Pb had greater toxicity than Zn in a shallow soil layer. Both the fraction of large soil macroaggregates (>2000 m) and the mean weight diameter (MWD) were positively correlated with GRSP, SOM and SOC at 0-20 cm soil depth (P < 0.05), demonstrating the important contributions of GRSP, SOM and proves SOC for binding soil particles together into large macro-aggregates and improving aggregate stability. Furthermore, MC and HLD had a significant positive correlation with GRSP, SOM, and SOC, suggesting that AMF played an essential role in the accumulation of GRSP, SOM, and SOC and subsequently affecting aggregate formation and particle size distribution in HM-loaded soils. Our study emphasized that the introduction of native plants associated with AMF could be a successful biotechnological tool to aid in the restoration of HM-contaminated soils and that appropriate management practices should be developed to derive maximum benefit from plant Ensure AMF symbiosis during ecological recovery.",,"Yang, Y.;He, C.;Huang, L.;Ban, Y.;Tang, M.",2017,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0182264,0,0,

Genes implicated in oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the neurological disorders Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Maternal choline supplementation restored transcript levels of a subset of genes to wild-type levels. In a separate experiment, a group of tx-j offspring continued to receive choline-supplemented or control diets with or without the copper chelator penicillamine (PCA) for 12 weeks to 24 weeks of age. Combined choline supplementation and PCA treatment of 24-week-old tx-j mice was associated with increased levels of liver transcripts of methionine metabolism and genes related to oxidative phosphorylation. Gender differences in gene expression within each treatment group were also observed. These results demonstrate that the transcriptional changes in oxidative phosphorylation and methionine metabolism genes in WM that arise during fetal life are partially prevented by prenatal maternal choline supplementation, a finding with potential relevance to preventive treatments for WM.",,"Medici, V.;Kieffer, D.

66,Copper induces hepatocyte damage due to stress on the endoplasmic reticulum in cultured cells and in patients with Wilson's disease,"Copper is an essential trace element, but excess copper is harmful to health. Excess copper-derived oxidants contribute to the progression of Wilson's disease, and oxidative stress induces the accumulation of abnormal proteins. It is known that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in correct protein folding and that the accumulation of misfolded proteins disrupts ER homeostasis, leading to ER stress. However, the copper-induced disruption of ER homeostasis is not fully understood. We treated the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) and the immortalized human hepatocyte cell line (OUMS29) with copper and chemical chaperones including 4-phenylbutyrate and ursodeoxycholic acid. We examined copper-induced oxidative stress, ER stress and apoptosis by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analysis. In addition, we examined the effects of copper on carcinogenesis. Excess copper not only induced oxidative stress but also ER stress. In addition, excess copper induced DNA damage and reduced cell proliferation. Chemical chaperones reduced this copper-induced hepatotoxicity. Excess copper induced hepatotoxicity by ER stress. We also confirmed the abnormality of the ultrastructure of the ER of hepatocytes in patients with Wilson's disease. These results demonstrate that ER stress plays a central role in Wilson's disease and suggest that chemical companions may have beneficial effects in Wilson's disease management.

67,Triethylenetetramine modulates polyamine and energy metabolism and inhibits cancer cell proliferation,"Polyamine metabolism is an attractive target for anticancer drugs because polyamines are absolutely necessary for cell proliferation and elevated levels of polyamines and their biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) have been linked to cancer. Triethylenetetramine (TETA) is a low-charge isosteric analogue of the polyamine spermidine (Spd) and a Cu(II)-chelating compound used to treat Wilson's disease and it has been considered as a potential anticancer therapeutic drug. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of TETA versus two other Cu(II) chelators, D-penicillamine (PA) and tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), on polyamine metabolism in DU145 prostate carcinoma, MCF-7 breast carcinoma and JEG- 3 choriocarcinoma cells. TETA induced antizymes, downregulated ODC and inhibited [(14)C]-Spd uptake. Furthermore, it completely prevented the alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)-induced increase in [(14)C]-Spd uptake and inhibited [(14)C]-putrescine (Put) uptake and ODC activity in vivo. Seven-day treatment of DU145 cells with TETA caused growth arrest by reducing intracellular polyamine levels and suppressing the production of hyposusinated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). TETA or its N-acetylated metabolites also inhibited spermine (Spm), diamine, and semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidases and decreased the amount of intracellular reactive oxygen species. In addition, TETA inhibited the utilization of put as an energy source via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as indicated by reduced production of (14)CO2 from [(14)C]put. These results indicate that TETA attacks several established anticancer drug targets not attributed to copper chelation, warranting further studies to demonstrate its potential in cancer chemoprevention and cure.

68,Solid state stability and solubility of triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride,"The API triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride used as an alternative treatment for Wilson's disease is water sensitive and exhibits polymorphism. Because this can become a problem for drug formulation, physical stability was studied by differential scanning calorimetry, high pressure thermal analysis, dynamic vapor sorption, and X-ray diffraction as a function of temperature. In addition, high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to study the purity and chemical stability of the API. A pressure-temperature phase diagram of the pure compound was constructed and it can be concluded that Form II is monotropic with respect to Form I, which is the only stable solid. The solubilities of the various solid forms were determined using a temperature-composition phase diagram. The API is very soluble, at 20 degrees C about 10% of the saturated solution in relation to the dihydrate consists of API and the solubility of the pure form I is twice as high. In addition, it has been shown that at 20 °C relative humidity above 40% induces the formation of the dihydrate and at 70% a saturated solution occurs. At higher temperatures, the formation of the dihydrate occurs at lower relative humidity levels. A clear correlation was found between the chemical stability of the active ingredient, its physical stability and relative humidity. Moisture levels above 40% affect the quality of the active ingredient.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of BMSC treatment on hepatolenticular degeneration-induced liver fibrosis and the impact on serological indicators. Sixty patients with hepatolenticular degeneration-induced liver fibrosis were randomly divided into two groups, a penicillamine group and a BMSCs plus penicillamine group of 30 patients each. The therapeutic effect on liver fibrosis, liver function and serological indicators were recorded before and after treatment and the data were compared. After treatment, serum levels of HA, PCIII, LN, CIV, TIMP-1 and MMP-1 were reduced in both groups (p<0.05). However, cytokine levels in the BMSCs plus penicillamine group were significantly lower than in the penicillamine group (p<0.05).

In addition, examination of the patient revealed the absence of protein C levels in the plasma. Eventually, the case was diagnosed as cirrhosis of the liver with protein C deficiency as the probable etiology.

72,The predictive value of low plasma copper and high plasma zinc in detecting zinc-induced copper deficiency,"BACKGROUND: Zinc-induced copper deficiency is a condition whose diagnosis is often delayed, leading to the development of severe and usually irreversible neurological symptoms. Plasma copper concentrations are usually low and plasma zinc concentrations are high. The aim of this study was to measure the predictive value of this combination of outcomes to facilitate early diagnosis. METHODS: Low plasma copper (<=6 micromol/L) and high plasma zinc (>18 micromol/L) results were retrieved from the laboratory database from 2000 to 2014. Medical records and laboratory notes of the corresponding 20 patients identified were accessed to determine who were likely to have zinc-induced copper deficiency. RESULTS: Fifteen (75%) patients were diagnosed with zinc-induced copper deficiency and 13 were symptomatic. Of the five remaining patients, two were treated with zinc for Wilson's disease, which was the cause of the hypocupremia, two were treated with parenteral zinc, and the last patient had insufficient information. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of low plasma copper and high plasma zinc is strongly predictive of the diagnosis of zinc-induced copper deficiency. Therefore, there is an opportunity for the reporting biochemist to facilitate their earlier diagnosis so that treatment can be implemented before the condition worsens.

73,Four-year follow-up of a pedigree of Wilson's disease complicated with epilepsy and hypopituitarism: case report with a literature review,"Rationale: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism with an excellent prognosis if treated early. However, WD is usually prone to neglect and misdiagnosis at an early stage. We reported a rare WD pedigree, and the clinical features, laboratory tests, and gene mutations were analyzed in detail. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was a 17-year-old, 136 cm tall girl who presented with limb weakness combined with multi-organ disorders, including eye blindness, epilepsy and hypopituitarism. DIAGNOSIS: Clinical testing revealed low serum ceruloplasmin levels, high urinary copper excretion and Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings. She carried compound heterozygous mutations in the ATP7B gene (c.2828G>A and c.3884C>T). Her younger brother presented as an asymptomatic patient with elevated transaminases but no neurological or hepatic symptoms. They were eventually diagnosed as WD. ACTION: They were treated with sodium dimercaptosulfonate supplemented with zinc gluconate, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and dietary copper restriction. RESULTS: Urinary copper excretion and serum transaminase levels gradually decreased. The abnormal signals in the brainstem and basal ganglia were also remarkably reduced after 4 years of decopper treatment. LESSONS: In patients with complicated clinical manifestations, extrapyramidal symptoms and basal ganglia signals should be considered. Serum ceruloplasmin detection and ATP7B gene mutation screening are required.",,"Zhang, Q. J.;Xu, L. Q.;Wang, C.;Hu, W.;Wang, N.;Chen, W.

74,Molybdenum Metallopharmaceutical Candidate Compounds – The “Renaissance” of Molybdenum Metallodrugs?,"Metal-based drugs, also known as “metallopharmaceuticals” or “metallodrugs”, are examples of sophisticated compounds that have long been used as therapeutics in inorganic medicinal chemistry. Few of them have shown essentially promising results, and many of them have been used in various stages of clinical trials. The Mo-based metallodrugs have been used successfully in the past to treat diseases such as anemia or Wilson's disease. In addition, Mo complexes are said to exert their effect through intercalation/splitting of DNA/RNA, inhibition of the cell cycle and modification of cell membrane functions. However, in the current literature there are no reliable and thorough reviews of the hypothetical therapeutic applications of all known molybdenum complexes as metallopharmaceuticals/metallodrugs. The focus was to in-depth review the potential applications of Mo-based complexes in medicinal chemistry as metal pharmaceuticals for the treatment of diseases such as cancer and tumors, Wilson's disease, diabetes mellitus, Huntington's chorea, atherosclerosis, and anemia. It must be emphasized that the development of innovative and new Mo-based metal drugs is not progressing rapidly today, and therefore the aim of this work was also to inspire colleagues working in the field of Mo compounds and try to “signpost” them to find research. The authors hope that this article will stimulate interest and usher in the renaissance of Mo compounds among medicinal inorganic chemists. This paper is the first review article in the literature that addresses and highlights many different and complex aspects of potential applications and capabilities of Mo-based metallodrugs.",,"Jurowska, A.;Jurowski, K.;Szklarzewicz, J.;Buszewski, B.;Kalenik, T.;Piekoszewski, W.",2016,,,0,0,

76,Long-term metabolic correction of Wilson's disease in a mouse model by gene therapy,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive copper storage disease due to mutations in the ATP7B gene that causes hepatic and neurological symptoms. Current treatments rely on lifelong copper chelators and zinc salts, which can cause side effects and do not restore normal copper metabolism. In this work, we evaluated the effectiveness of gene therapy to treat this condition. METHODS: We transduced the liver of the ATP7b(-/-) WD mouse model with an adeno-associated vector serotype 8 (AAV8) encoding the human ATP7B cDNA placed under the control of the liver-specific alpha1-antitrypsin promoter (AAV8 -AAT -ATP7B). After vector administration, we performed periodic assessment of parameters associated with copper metabolism and disease progression. Animals were sacrificed 6 months after treatment to analyze copper storage and liver histology. RESULTS: We observed a dose-dependent therapeutic effect of AAV8-AAT-ATP7B, manifested in the reduction of serum transaminases and urinary copper excretion, normalization of serum holoceruloplasmin, and restoration of physiological biliary copper excretion in response to copper overload. The livers of the treated animals showed a normalization of the copper content and the absence of histological changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that AAV8-AAT-ATP7B-mediated gene therapy provides long-term correction of copper metabolism in a clinically relevant animal model of WD and provides support for future translational studies.

77,Subclinical neurological involvement does not develop if Wilson disease is treated early,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that causes dysfunction of various organs, mainly the liver and brain. Untreated, WD is fatal, but early treatment leads to a good prognosis, although the long-term neurological outcome is unclear. To address this issue, we assessed the neurological status of early-treated MM patients without overt nervous system impairment at least 10 years after treatment initiation using neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and imaging techniques. METHODS: Thirty-eight MM patients (18 women, aged 24.47 +/- 7.50 years) who received early diagnosis (in presymptomatic or mild/moderate stages of liver disease without neurological involvement) and prompt treatment were enrolled with the Global Assessment clinically graded scale. Presentation was hepatic in 36 patients (95%) while 2 patients (5%) were presymptomatic. A neurophysiological study was performed to examine upper and lower limb central motor conduction time and motor cortex excitability using single-pulse and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. Neuroimages were obtained using magnetic resonance scans of the brain. Cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral abilities were assessed using neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: Patients were treated with penicillamine (7 patients) or zinc salts (31 patients) with good adherence. They showed no neurological signs on clinical assessment or on any specific impairment scale, the mean score on the global assessment scale was 0.3 +/- 0.7. Magnetic resonance imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation studies, and neuropsychological/neuropsychiatric assessment ruled out subclinical involvement.

80,Novel Zeb2 gene variation in Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS),"BACKGROUND: Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare association with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). Phenotypic characteristics can develop over time, leading to initial difficulties in diagnosis. MWS results from haploinsufficiency of the zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) gene and molecular diagnosis of the ZEB2 mutation is required to confirm the diagnosis. We report the first confirmed cases of MWS in three children with the typical facial features, intellectual disability, absent corpus callosum, epilepsy and HSCR and novel Zeb2 variations on DNA analyses. METHOD: Clinical features were monitored. DNA extracted from peripheral blood was subjected to bidirectional sequence analysis after PCR DNA amplification. The ZEB2 gene results were compared to the ZEB2 reference sequence (ENS00000169554) for variation. The bioinformatic investigation of new gene variants was carried out using the ""Blastx"" program function, which is available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.bioinfo.org/NPInter/blast/blast_link.cgi). RESULTS: Clinical follow-up revealed that the phenotypic traits were not all present at birth but evolved over time in 2 surviving patients. Several Zeb2 variations were detected in the promoter region of the ZEB2 gene, 2 of which were novel (-56A/T 1174 11A/12A). Furthermore, a novel heterozygous insertion of a single nucleotide into exon 2 of ZEB2 in a patient results in a frameshift that causes deletion of the first 8 amino acids of the ZEB2 protein and alteration of amino acids 9 (G9A), 11 (R11G), and 12 (C12A). In the third patient, a new single nucleotide deletion of exon 8 (1784delC Het) results in a frameshift at amino acid 595 of the translated protein. This shortens the protein from 1214 to 594 amino acids and impairs the functionality of the critical ZEB2 protein. CONCLUSIONS: MWS is an important link that needs to be recognized clinically. It underscores the functionality of the Zeb2 gene in certain syndromic Hirschsprung disease. These variations likely contribute to the clinical features of the Mowat-Wilson phenotype in Hirschsprung disease, but should be confirmed in further research. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

81,D-penicillamine-induced ANA(+) ANCA(+) vasculitis in pediatric patients with Wilson's disease,"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are associated with systemic vasculitis. The pathophysiology of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) has not been clearly established, and drug-induced ANCA-associated vasculitis has been reported. Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the copper-transporting gene ATP7B, and traditional treatment is based on copper chelation with drugs such as D-penicillamine. There have been rare reports that prolonged D-penicillamine therapy can lead to renal adverse events such as membranous nephropathy and minimal change disease, but it is questionable whether D-penicillamine induces ANCA-associated vasculitis. We describe 2 patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine who presented with ANCA (+) vasculitis and renal involvement. The 2 patients also showed positive results for antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Her renal biopsy findings were consistent with Pauci immune-type crescentic/necrotizing glomerulonephritis. After diagnosis of AAV, D-penicillamine was discontinued. The patients were then treated with plasmapheresis and immunosuppressants, including methylprednisolone pulse therapy and intravenous cyclophosphamide. One patient progressed to end-stage renal disease and the other presented with persistent proteinuria. These cases suggest that in pediatric patients D-penicillamine can induce ANA (+) ANCA (+) vasculitis with severe renal involvement and plasmapheresis in combination with immunosuppressants should be considered.",,"Lee, Y.;Lee, S.

The development of chelator-induced immunological adverse events is a problem, particularly under D-penicillamine therapy. This study evaluated the prevalence of coexisting or treatment-emergent immune-mediated diseases in patients with Wilson's disease and evaluated the role of antinuclear antibodies in therapy monitoring. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 235 patients with Wilson's disease. Medical therapies were classified and analyzed in terms of adverse events and antinuclear antibody responses. RESULTS: Coexisting immune-mediated diseases were evident in 19/235 (8.1%) patients, of whom 13/235 (5.5%) had pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Six patients (2.6%) developed an autoimmune disease on therapy, all on long-term treatment with D-penicillamine. Data on antinuclear antibody courses during treatment and adverse events were available for patients treated with D-penicillamine (n = 91), trientine (n = 58) and zinc salts (n = 58). No significant increase in antinuclear antibody titer detected. CONCLUSIONS: A minority of patients on long-term therapy with D-penicillamine developed an immune-mediated disease. Elevated antinuclear antibodies were commonly found, but no correlations between elevated antinuclear antibodies and the development of immune-mediated diseases or medical treatments were evident. Therefore, the value of antinuclear antibodies in monitoring adverse events associated with chelation therapy appears to be limited.",,"Seessle, J.;Gotthardt, D.

During long-term treatment with chelating agents, a two-day interruption of treatment should result in normal urinary copper concentrations (< 50 µg/dl). The aim of this study was to establish the usefulness of this method as a compliance assessment in these patients. We studied consecutive patients treated with d-penicillamine (DPA) who underwent routine follow-up studies at our center. We performed a 24-hour analysis of urinary copper excretion 48 h after discontinuation of chelation therapy. Thirty-two patients were included. After stopping DPA, normalization of copper excretion was observed in 91% of the patients who were said to be in compliance. The specificity and sensitivity values of this test were 87% and 77%, respectively. Measurement of 24-hour urinary copper excretion after a 48-hour interruption of DPA therapy in patients with WM is a reliable method to confirm patient compliance.",,"Dziezyc, K.;Litwin, T.;Chabik, G.;Czlonkowska, A.",2015,Oct-Dec,,0,0,
86,Trientine-induced colitis during therapy for Wilson's disease: a case report and review of the literature,"BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of human copper metabolism characterized by hepatic copper accumulation due to impaired biliary copper excretion. Accumulation of copper in the brain can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms. Trientine (triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride) is a copper chelating agent used to treat patients with WM. Trientine has been considered an option for initial and maintenance treatment of WM because of its safety profile. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old woman with recently diagnosed WM was initiated on treatment with trientine for her WM. Within a month, she developed severe bloody diarrhea that did not respond to medical treatment. Trientine was discontinued and colonoscopy with biopsy revealed moderately active ileitis and moderate to severe pancolitis consistent with drug-induced mucosal injury. The colitis improved immediately after stopping trientine and recurred when the medication was re-challenged for worsening WM symptoms. After the second mandatory discontinuation of trientine, she remained on zinc therapy for her WM and her colitis resolved over time. CONCLUSION: Drug-induced colitis is a very rare side effect of trientine. Although trientine therapy is well tolerated and fewer side effects are reported with this drug than with penicillamine, colitis can occur during trientine treatment. Zinc therapy may be an effective alternative treatment for WM in patients experiencing side effects from chelation therapy.",,"Boga, S.;Jain, D.;Schilsky, M.

The first successful characterization of binary Cu(I)-CSH and Cu(I)-GSH species over the entire pH range was achieved in this study by the addition of a second thioamino acid, which prevented the precipitation that normally occurs. Appropriate combinations of binary and ternary (mixed ligand) titration data were used to optimize the speciation models and formation constants for the binary species. The results obtained differ significantly from literature data regarding the detection and quantification of protonated and multinuclear complexes. The present results are considered reliable constants because of the exceptionally wide pH and concentration ranges used, the excellent reproducibility of the data, the close agreement between the calculated and observed formation functions, and the small standard deviations and lack of numerical correlation in the. The present formation constants were integrated into a large Cu speciation model, which was used for the first time to predict metal-ligand equilibria in human eye biofluids. This simulation provided an explanation for the shedding of metallic copper in the lens and cornea, which is known to occur as a consequence of Wilson's disease.",,"Konigsberger, L.

89,Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation in an 8-month-old boy,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that, without diagnosis and treatment, can lead to fatal neurological and hepatic disorders. The youngest child with normal liver function reported to date is an 8-month-old Japanese boy with low ceruloplasmin levels, and the youngest child with elevated aminotransferase ever reported to date is a 9-month-old Korean boy confirmed by genetic testing became. Here we report an 8-month-old Chinese boy who presented with elevated liver enzymes and low serum ceruloplasmin levels. Genetic analysis of the ATP7B gene revealed two heterozygous disease-causing mutations (c.2621C>T/p.A874V and c.3809A>G/p.N1270S) and the parental lineage was determined. The sustained elevation of serum aminotransferases in this infant normalized after zinc therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the youngest patient with elevated liver enzymes ever reported anywhere in the world. We hope this will raise awareness among pediatricians, leading to earlier diagnosis, timely treatment and better clinical outcomes.",,"Abuduxikuer, K.;Li, L. T.;Qiu, Y. L.;Wang, N. L.;Wang, J.

90,Elevated copper impairs hepatic nuclear receptor function in Wilson disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in accumulation of copper in the liver as a result of mutations in the gene encoding the copper-transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7B). WD is a chronic liver disease and individuals with the disease present with a variety of complications including steatosis, cholestasis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. Similar to patients with WD, Atp7b-/- mice show significantly increased levels of hepatic copper and liver pathology. Previous studies have shown that replacing zinc in the DNA-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER) with copper disrupts specific binding to DNA response elements. Here we found reduced binding of nuclear receptors FXR, RXR, HNF4alpha and LRH-1 to promoter-response elements and reduced mRNA expression of nuclear receptor target genes in Atp7b-/- mice and in adult and pediatric MV patients. Excessive hepatic copper has been described in progressive familial cholestasis (PFIC), and we found that patients with PFIC2 or PFIC3 who have clinically elevated hepatic copper levels, similar to those with WD, have impaired nuclear receptor activity. Taken together, these data indicate that copper-mediated nuclear receptor dysfunction impairs liver function in WM and possibly in other diseases associated with elevated hepatic copper levels.",,"Wooton-Kee, C.

91,Zinc therapy for Wilson's disease in children in French pediatric centers,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Zinc therapy is considered a good option in Wilson's disease (WD), as a first-line treatment in pre-symptomatic children, and as maintenance therapy after initial chelation therapy. The aim of the study was to determine the practical benefit of zinc treatment in French pediatric centers. METHODS: A national survey was conducted in the 6 French centers where zinc acetate was used to treat WM. Clinical and biological parameters, dosage and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 26 children were reported to have been treated with zinc acetate alone or in conjunction with chelating agents. Of the 9 children (35%) receiving zinc alone as first-line therapy, 2 were switched to D-penicillamine for ineffectiveness and 7 remained on zinc alone, but serum transaminase levels normalized in only 4 of them. Five children (19%) were initially treated with zinc in combination with D-penicillamine (n = 4) or trientine (n = 1) with good efficacy. Among the 12 children (46%) who received zinc as maintenance therapy after D-penicillamine, there was no recurrence of hepatic cytolysis during a median follow-up of 5.2 years, but 2 of them were switched to trientine because of zinc-related side effects. Upper abdominal pain was observed in 4 children and gastric perforation occurred in 1 child. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates a low efficacy of zinc as first-line therapy for controlling liver disease in half of presymptomatic children and a high incidence of associated gastrointestinal adverse events in children with WM.",,"Santiago, R.;Gottrand, F.;Debray, D.;Bridoux, L.;Lachaux, A.;Morali, A.;Lapeyre, D.;Lamireau, T.",2015,Dec,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0000000000000926,0,1,
92,The role of oxidative stress in worsening neurological Wilson disease after chelation therapy,"Patients with neurological Wilson disease (NWD) may deteriorate with treatment, but there is no study examining the role of oxidative stress. We report the role of plasma glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in worsening NWD after treatment. Fifty-one treatment-naïve NWD patients underwent a detailed clinical evaluation. NWD severity was noted and dystonia was measured using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) score. Their hematological, serum chemistry, abdominal ultrasound, and skull MRI changes were noted. Plasma GSH, TAC and MDA, serum free copper (Cu) and 24-hour urinary Cu were measured at admission and 3 and 6 months after treatment. Patients were classified as deteriorating if there was one or more grade worsening of the severity scale, a >10% worsening of the BFM score, or the onset of new neurological symptoms. The mean age of the patients was 11 (5-37) years and 12 were women. After treatment, 25 patients improved, 12 worsened, and 14 were hospitalized. The worsening group had lower GSH (1.99 +/- 0.17 vs. 2.30 +/- 0.30 mg/dL; P=0.004) and TAC (1.59 +/- 0, 12 vs. 1.82 +/- 0.17 mmol Trolox equivalent/L). ; P=0.001) and higher MDA levels (5.24 +/- 0.22 vs. 4.34 +/- 0.46 nmol/mL; P < 0.001) compared to the improved group. These changes were associated with an increase in serum free Cu (41.81 +/- 3.31 versus 35.62 +/- 6.40 microg/dL; P = 0.02) and 24-hour urine Cu ( 206.42 +/- 41.61 versus 121.99 +/- 23.72) associated microg/24 hr; P < 0.001) in the deteriorated versus improved group. All patients with deterioration were treated with penicillamine. Worsening after chelation treatment in NWD may be due to oxidative stress induced by increased serum-free Cu. These results may have future therapeutic implications and need further investigation.",,"Kalita, J.;Kumar, V.;Ranjan, A.;Misra, U. K.",2015,Dec,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12017-015-8364-8,0,0,
93,Zeb2: A multifunctional regulator of nervous system development,"Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (Zeb) 2 is a transcription factor identified for its ability to bind Smad proteins and consists of multiple functional domains that interact with a variety of transcriptional co-effectors. The complex nature of Zeb2, both at the genetic and protein levels, underlies its multifunctional properties, with Zeb2 being able to act alone or as part of a transcriptional complex to repress and occasionally activate target gene expression. This review introduces Zeb2 as a key regulator of nervous system development. Zeb2 is expressed in the nervous system throughout its development, indicating its importance in neurogenic and gliogenic processes. Indeed, mutation of Zeb2 has dramatic neurological consequences in both animal models and humans with Mowat-Wilson syndrome, which results from heterozygous ZEB2 mutations. The mechanisms by which Zeb2 regulates induction of the neuroectoderm (CNS system) and neural crest (PNS system) are discussed here. We then describe how Zeb2 controls formation, delamination, migration, and specification of neural crest cells. The Zeb2 regulation of development in a number of cerebral regions, including the neocortex and hippocampus, are then described. The different molecular mechanisms mediating Zeb2-driven development of different neuronal and glial populations are reviewed. The role of Zeb2 in the development of the spinal cord and enteric nervous system is outlined, while its essential function in CNS myelination is also described. Finally, this review discusses how the neurodevelopmental defects of Zeb2-mutated mice delineate the developmental abnormalities underlying the multiple neurological defects observed in patients with Mowat-Wilson syndrome.

94,Coagulation parameters in Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Changes in copper metabolism have been associated with changes in clotting factors. The aim of the present study was to analyze coagulation factors in WM patients. Methods: 100 patients from a tertiary WM outpatient clinic were analyzed in a prospective cross-sectional cohort study. Coagulation factors were determined from peripheral venous blood samples including: complete blood count, INR, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, von Willebrand factor/antigen, fibrinogen , antithrombin III, protein S, protein C, resistance to activated protein C (APC). Subgroup analyzes of blood tests were performed for sex, initial clinical presentation, WM treatment, and liver function. RESULTS: Subgroup analysis by liver function showed reduced values of factors II, V, VII and X. Subgroup analysis by gender or clinical course of the disease did not show any significant changes in coagulation. Significantly decreased levels of factors II, VII and antithrombin III and increased levels of von Willebrand factor/antigen were observed in patients treated with trientine. Factor VIII levels were significantly reduced in patients receiving zinc. CONCLUSION: Although significant differences in some coagulation parameters were found in the subgroup analysis, no clinically relevant changes in the coagulation system were found in WM patients.",,"Schaefer, M.;Weber, L.;Gotthardt, D.;Seessle, J.;Stremmel, W.;Pfeiffenberger, J.;Weiss, K.

95,Early neurological deterioration in patients with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Early neurological deterioration during treatment initiation in Wilson's disease (WD) is an unresolved problem. Our aim was to determine the frequency and outcome of early neurological deterioration in patients with WM. METHODS: We analyzed 143 symptomatic patients diagnosed with WM between 2005 and 2009. Early neurological deterioration was based on deterioration on the Unified Wilson's Disease Score Scale assessed at baseline over 6 months or the onset of new neurological symptoms. Reversibility of deterioration was followed up to 24 months. RESULTS: Early neurological deterioration was observed in 11.1% (16/143) and only affected patients with neurological symptoms at diagnosis. The median time to deterioration from the start of treatment was 2.3 +/- 1.9 months. Neurological deterioration was fully reversible in 53% (8/15) and partially in 13% (2/15) of patients over 9.2 +/- 5.2 months. Patients with early deterioration had a significantly more severe neurological deficit at baseline, a higher prevalence of thalamic (66% vs. 29%) and brainstem lesions (73% vs. 33%) observed on magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, and used more frequently concomitant dopamine receptor antagonists (46% vs. 5%). Disease duration, type of treatment (d-penicillamine or zinc sulfate), type of neurological manifestation, initial copper metabolism results, and liver function parameters did not differ between the groups evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological deterioration may occur in over 10% of WM patients upon initiation of anti-copper therapy. Particular attention should be paid to patients with severe initial neurological manifestations, advanced brain injuries and the use of dopamine receptor antagonists. The type of anti-copper therapy did not show a clear association with early neurological deterioration.

We report radiographic changes in four patients with WDN that worsen after penicillamine. METHODS: WDN was diagnosed on the basis of clinical, KF ring, serum ceruloplasmin, and 24-hour urine copper. Haematological, biochemical, and cranial MRIs were repeated at the time of clinical deterioration after chelation. RESULTS: Four WDN patients had neurologic deterioration within 4-8 weeks of penicillamine therapy. This was associated with new lesions in the white matter, thalamus, pons, and midbrain, and these lesions showed diffusion limitation. Neurological deterioration was associated with increases in serum free copper and malanodialdehyde and decreased glutathione. The clinical conditions stabilized after a few weeks of stopping penicillamine. CONCLUSION: Neurological deterioration was associated with new lesions on MRI, demonstrating diffusion limitation. Increased free copper-induced oxidative stress may be responsible for these changes. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,"Ranjan, A.;Kalita, J.;Kumar, V.;Misra, U.

He consulted an ophthalmologist who suspected the presence of a sunflower cataract and a Kayser-Fleischer ring. On admission, his liver function tests were slightly impaired (Child-Pugh C, 10 pts). Neurological examination was normal, but cognitive function was slightly impaired. Based on the copper metabolism abnormalities and clinical manifestation, we diagnosed Wilson's disease (Ferenci score, 6 points) and started treatment with D-penicillamine.

101,Inductively coupled plasma laser ablation mass spectrometry imaging of metals in experimental and clinical Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder in which the liver does not properly secrete copper into the bile, resulting in marked accumulation of copper in various tissues. Affected patients suffer from liver disease and severe neurological defects. Experimental studies in mutant mice defective in the copper-transporting ATPase gene (Atp7b) revealed a dramatic, time-dependent accumulation of hepatic copper associated with the formation of cirrhotic-like regenerative nodules. Therefore, these mice represent an excellent study model for Wilson's disease. However, little is known about the exact time course of copper accumulation in the liver and its effects on other trace metals in the liver. We have recently established novel inductively coupled plasma laser ablation mass spectrometry protocols that enable quantitative metal imaging in human and murine liver tissue with high sensitivity, spatial resolution, specificity, and quantitation capability. By using these techniques, we set out here to comparatively analyze hepatic metal content in wild-type and Atp7b-deficient mice during aging. We show that the age-dependent accumulation of hepatic copper is strictly associated with a concomitant increase in iron and zinc, while the intrahepatic concentration and distribution of other metals or metalloids is unaffected. The same findings were obtained in well-defined human liver samples obtained from patients with Wilson's disease. We conclude that in Wilson's disease, hepatic copper imbalances during aging are closely correlated with changes in intrahepatic iron and zinc levels. Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

102,Bone demineralization in a large cohort of Wilson disease patients,"OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND: We compared the bone mineral density (BMD) of adult patients with Wilson's disease (WD) (n=148) with an age- and sex-matched healthy control population (n=148). Within the WD cohort, correlations of BMD with WD disease parameters, laboratory results, type of treatment, and known osteoporosis risk factors were analyzed. METHODS: Hip and lumbar spine absolute BMD and T-score were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Osteoporosis and osteopenia were defined as a T-score <= -2.5 and between -1 and -2.5, respectively. RESULTS: There were significantly more patients with abnormal T-scores in the WD population (58.8%) than in the control population (45.3%) (chi(2)=6.65, df=2, p=0.036 ), as there were 50.0% osteopenic and 8.8% osteoporotic MV patients versus 41.2% and 4.1% in controls, respectively. In particular, the BMD measurements of the L2-L4 spine (BMD and T-scores) differed significantly between the WD population and the corresponding controls. L2-L4 spine BMD was on average 0.054 g/cm(2) (5.1%) lower in WM patients than in matched normal controls (0.995 +/- 0.156 vs. 1.050 +/- 0.135; p= 0.002). We found no significant correlation between BMD values and any of the WD disease parameters (eg, severity of liver disease), laboratory results, type of treatment, or known osteoporosis risk factors. Duration of D-penicillamine treatment was negatively correlated with femoral BMD, but in a clinically irrelevant manner when compared to age and gender. Importantly, BMD remained significantly lower in WM patients (n=89) compared to controls after excluding WM patients with cirrhosis (p=0.009).

The predetermined ion-exchange reaction instead of chelation between ZnPB NPs and copper ions leads to a high selectivity of such NPs for copper in the presence of the other endogenous metal ions. Furthermore, ZnPB NPs are highly water-dispersible and non-cytotoxic, and can be easily internalized by cells to target intracellular copper ions for selective copper detoxification, suggesting their potential application as new-generation treatments for WD.",,"Kandanapitiye, M.

Anetoderma is a rare benign condition characterized by focal damage to dermal elastic tissue. Previous reports have described this skin condition in the context of prolonged D-penicillamine therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old male was referred for evaluation of an asymptomatic elevation in aminotransferase levels. The tests showed negative markers for chronic viral and autoimmune hepatitis, low ceruloplasmin levels and increased urinary copper excretion. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis with moderate activity and severe bridging fibrosis. Mutation analysis revealed a composite heterozygous genotype and supported the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Skin lesions consisting of numerous white to pale papules less than 7–8 mm in diameter with a central prominence located on the upper part of the body were also observed at the time of the initial physical examination. Primary anetoderma was determined based on presentation and skin biopsy findings. Therapy with D-penicillamine at a daily dose of 1500 mg was started and during the 12-month follow-up period the aminotransferase decreased to normal and the skin lesions remained unchanged.

OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate once-daily trientine as a therapy for Wilson's disease. METHODS: STUDY GROUP: Eight patients (seven males) aged 22-71 years with stable Wilson's disease treated at ages 4-50 years. Patients were monitored for 3 months and then for 12 months on a single daily dose of trientine (15 mg/kg). RESULTS: All patients remained clinically healthy. ALT and AST varied in some, but none required treatment interruptions or side effects. The synthetic function of the liver was unchanged. The mean 24-hour urinary excretion of copper and zinc at the end of treatment was 313.4 +/- 191.7 and 2214 +/- 1346 µg, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily administration of trientine should be further investigated as a possible maintenance therapy in WM. A single daily dose can improve adherence to therapy.

108,Detection of D-penicillamine in skin lesions in dermal elastosis after previous long-term treatment of Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Adverse skin events associated with D-penicillamine (DPA) are common and varied, although the presence of DPA or its metabolites in the skin has never been documented due to the inherent difficulties in determining its tissue levels. Therefore, the association between DPA and DPA-related dermatoses was assumed only on the basis of careful history, clinical observation, and typical histopathological findings. OBJECTIVE: Detection of DPA in biopsy specimens in a unique case of 25-year-old late-onset elastosis perforans serpiginosa and pseudo-pseudoxanthoma elasticum associated with a history of long-term high-dose DPA by applying a recently described analytical method to assess the presence of DPA in the Skin. METHODS: We used a reliable analytical method based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with amperometric detection to search for the presence of DPA in skin biopsy samples. RESULTS: A chromatographic peak corresponding to DPA was detected in some affected skin samples collected from the patient. CONCLUSION: We documented the effective presence and persistence of DPA after 25 years in the skin of a woman affected by elastic skin lesions due to long-term DPA therapy. This report provides further evidence for the relationship between DPA deposition in affected skin and clinical manifestation.

109,A case of Wilson's disease with characteristic laparoscopic findings,"medical examination revealed liver dysfunction in a 44-year-old man. Blood tests and computed tomography revealed cirrhosis of the liver. He was then referred to our hospital for further examination. After the blood test, viral markers showed a previous infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). We assessed the etiology of his liver disease as previous HBV infection. On laparoscopic examination, his liver surface was nodular with mixed yellowish nodules and ash gray to coppery nodules 3-10 mm in diameter. There were large regenerative nodules in segments 3 and 4. Large regenerative nodules and irregular steatosis were inconsistent with HBV-related liver cirrhosis, so we assumed Wilson's disease. The copper excretion in the urine was 326.6 µg (>100 µg/24 h). After administration of D-penicillamine, the copper excretion in the urine increased to 2151.5 µg/24 h. Although the hepatic copper concentration was 174.5 µg/g wet tissue (> 200 µg/g wet tissue), his laboratory data met the Leipzig diagnostic criteria proposed by the EASL.

CASE REPORT: A 22-year-old male patient presented initially with predominant signs and symptoms of a psychiatric disorder and later with the development of neurological signs and symptoms. Neuroimaging detected metal deposits in the central nervous system (CNS) but not in peripheral organs, while serum analysis ruled out pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration and aceruloplasminemia. Decreased copper and ceruloplasmin levels and CNS metal deposits supported the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, but other pathognomonic signs and symptoms were absent: increased urinary copper, Kayser-Fleischer rings in Descemet's corneal membrane, and copper deposits in the liver. The introduction of penicillamine treatment led to an improvement in the patient's mental and general health. Molecular genetic analysis clearly confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. CONCLUSION: Wilson's disease can go undetected for a long time if masked with dominant or exclusive psychiatric symptoms. If there are no clear clinical symptoms and unambiguous laboratory findings, a molecular genetic test is required to secure the definitive diagnosis.",,"Krstic, D.;Antonijevic, J.;Spiric, Z.",2014,Dec,,0,0,

112,Health implications of the discovery of human zinc deficiency,"The essentiality of zinc in humans was established in 1963. Enormous advances in both clinical and basic research into zinc metabolism in humans have been observed over the last 50 years. growth retardation; cell-mediated immune dysfunction and cognitive impairment are the major clinical effects in humans. Currently >300 enzymes and >1000 transcription factors are known that require zinc for their activities. Zinc is a second messenger of immune cells and intracellular free zinc in these cells is involved in signaling events. Zinc has been used very successfully as a therapeutic modality to treat acute diarrhea in children, Wilson's disease, the common cold, and to prevent blindness in patients with age-related dry macular degeneration. In addition to modulating cell-mediated immunity, zinc is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Zinc supplementation in the elderly results in a reduced incidence of infection, reduced oxidative stress, and reduced production of inflammatory cytokines. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

114,The promise of copper-lowering therapy with tetrathiomolybdate in curing cancer and treating inflammatory diseases,"Tetrathiomolybdate(TM) is a unique anti-copper drug developed for the treatment of the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease, for which it is excellent. Since copper was known to be required for angiogenesis, TM was tested in mouse cancer models to see if it would inhibit tumor growth through an anti-angiogenic effect. TM was extremely effective in these models, but all of the tumors in the models started out small in size - micrometastatic in size. Later, TM was tested in numerous human cancer studies, where it showed only modest effects. However, the mouse doctrine of efficacy against microdiseases was forgotten - all studies were of massive, advanced cancer. Now the mouse evidence comes to life again. Three groups cure or have high efficacy of TM against advanced human cancers that have heretofore been virtually incurable, particularly when the cancer has been reduced to no sign of disease (NED) status by conventional therapy. In this situation, where the residual disease is micrometastatic, TM therapy appears to be curative. We designed and initiated a study on TM in canine osteosarcoma in the micrometastatic phase to provide a solid scientific basis for these findings. TM also has important anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting copper-dependent cytokines involved in inflammation. This anti-inflammatory effect may be involved in TM's anti-cancer effects, as cancers as they progress attract inflammatory cells that provide a wealth of additional proangiogenic agents.

115,Penicillamine challenge test in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is one of the most common metabolic liver diseases in children. Early diagnosis of the disease is essential as specific treatment can be offered that prevents further hepatocellular damage and neurological complications. There is no single diagnostic test that can rule out or confirm the disease with certainty. Penicillamine challenge has proven to be a useful diagnostic test to detect WD. The main purpose of this study was to observe the reliability of the penicillamine challenge test in diagnosing WD. The cross-sectional study was conducted with a case-control design at the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, BSMMU, Dhaka. The study was conducted on 60 CLD patients. Along with other physical findings and laboratory tests, the 24-hour urinary copper excretions before and after penicillamine challenge were estimated. The study results were statistically evaluated. Thirty CLD patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria of WD were considered cases (Group I), and the remaining 30 CLD patients were considered non-Wilsonian CLD and designated controls (Group II). In the control group, 12 CLD patients were HBsAg positive, 1 had hepatitis C virus infection, 1 had autoimmune hepatitis, and the remaining 16 CLD patients were cryptogenic. The (mean +/- SD) age of WM patients was 9.90 +/- 28 years; The male-female ratio was 1.5:1. The most common presentation was ascites (70%). KF ring was found in 86.7% of cases. Serum ceruloplasmin levels were significantly lower in WM patients (mean +/- SD, 0.1197 +/- 23 g/L, p<0.001). Baseline urinary copper excretion in WM patients differed significantly from controls (median 219.0 µg/24 hours, range 35-2018 µg/24 hours versus median 44 µg/24 hours, range 20-238 µg/24 hours , p<0.001). Baseline urinary copper excretion greater than 100 mg/24 hours was observed in 80% of WM patients compared to 10% in controls. Urinary copper excretion after penicillamine was significantly higher in WM patients than in controls (median 2635 mg/24 h, range 648-6222 mg/24 h, versus median 423 mg/24 h, range 91-1250 mg/24 h, p<0.001). Post-penicillamine urinary copper above 1600 mg/24 hours was observed in 70% of WM patients, while none reached the level in the control group. The 24-hour urinary copper determination after penicillamine challenge has been shown to be a valuable test in the diagnosis of WM.",,"Mazumder, M. W.;Karim, M. B.;Rukunuzzaman, M.",2014,Jul,,0,0,
116,Metalloproteomics: Focus on metabolic issues related to metals,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Metalloproteomics offers a research strategy to study metal-related nutritional and metabolic issues through the determination of metalloproteomes using high-throughput methodology. In this review article, we examine recent developments in metalloproteomics since its inception about 12 years ago, when we used metalloproteomics to study copper disposition in hepatocytes associated with Wilson's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: A metalloproteome is the group of proteins that have metal-binding capacity by being metalloproteins or by having metal-binding sites. Like all proteomes, a metalloproteome is governed by a well-defined framework. It can be determined for a single metal or multiple metals in this system. Aside from major technological advances in analytical techniques, recent work has examined metalloproteomes for metals other than copper, particularly nickel, zinc, and manganese. Given the importance of microbiomes for metabolism, microbial metalloproteomics is a fast-growing and promising new field. ABSTRACT: Metals play a key role in metabolic processes. Enough technological advances have taken place in the last decade to make metalloproteomics an exciting and innovative type of nutritional and metabolic research. It explains how metals contribute to metabolic physiology in all strains, including microbes. For humans, it can elucidate mechanisms and identify meaningful diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers.",,"Roberts, E. A.;Sarkar, B.",2014,Sep,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MCO.0000000000000085,0,0,
117,Symptomatic copper deficiency in three patients with Wilson's disease treated with zinc sulfate,"Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by excess copper, leading to accumulation of copper mainly in the liver and brain and requiring lifelong decopper therapy. However, overtreatment with anticopper drugs can lead to copper deficiency, which can cause neurological and haematological symptoms. Copper is an important cofactor for many enzymes. This report describes three WM patients diagnosed with copper deficiency while being treated with zinc sulfate (ZS). After 5-16 years of therapy, all patients developed leukopenia. Spinal cord injury was found in two of the patients. One of them also showed myopathy. In summary, copper deficiency can occur at different time points after the start of treatment, thus requiring regular copper metabolism and hematological monitoring.

119,Bone mineralization in children with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine bone mineralization in children with Wilson's disease (WD). METHODS: Twenty-seven patients (16 males) and two age- and sex-matched healthy children for each patient were enrolled in the study. Bone mineral content (BMC, grams) and density (BMD, g/cm(2)) at lumbar vertebrae 1-4 were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Calcium excretion in the urine was calculated for 19 patients. The effect of cirrhosis and hypercalciuria on BMC and BMD has also been studied in WM patients. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between patients and healthy controls in mean BMC (33.0 +/- 13.9 vs. 35.8 +/- 13.8 g) (p=0.940) and mean BMD Scores (0.66 +/- 0.16 vs. 0.71+). /-0.18 g/cm(2)) (p=0.269). Nine (47.4%) patients had hypercalciuria. Patients with hypercalciuria had statistically significantly lower BMC and BMD values than patients without hypercalciuria. A significant difference remained after adjusting for age, weight, height, and pubertal stage, but disappeared after adjusting for weight, height, length of follow-up, and pubertal stage. The presence of cirrhosis did not significantly affect BMC and BMD in WM patients. CONCLUSIONS: BMC and BMD in children with WD were normal.

Liver transplantation is indicated in approximately 5% of WM patients with acute liver failure as the onset of the disease, most commonly in the second decade of life, or in patients with end-stage liver disease and severe hepatic impairment, most commonly in the third and fourth decades. Liver transplantation restores normal biliary copper excretion (thereby preventing disease recurrence) and promotes the removal of copper from extrahepatic sites. Liver transplant results at WD are excellent, both in cadaveric and living donors. Copyright © 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.",,"Schilsky, M.

122,Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is a copper transport disorder that results from the defective function of a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, ATP7B. WD incidence is approximately 1/50-10,000 live births worldwide. Clinical manifestations of WM can be of any type, but usually the symptoms of presentation are hepatic or neuropsychiatric, with a wide range of disorders for both groups of symptoms. However, children may be absent clinical symptoms, making diagnosis of the disease more difficult than in adults. Liver manifestations can range from asymptomatic minor biochemical abnormalities to acute but usually chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or severe fulminant liver failure. The spectrum of neurological manifestations is wide, including tremor, hypersalivation, dysarthria, incoordination, dystonia, ataxia. The spectrum of psychiatric manifestations is wide and can include various disorders such as altered work performance, anxiety, depression and antisocial behavior. Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF) are present in 95% of patients with neurological symptoms and just over half of patients without neurological symptoms. KF rings are usually absent in children with liver disease. To obtain a more reliable diagnosis of WM, the Leipzig scoring system was proposed by an international consensus of experts. Copper overload in Wilson's disease is treated with chelating agents such as penicillamine, trientine, and tetrathiomolybdate.

123,Tripodal D-penicillamine derivatives as efficient copper(I) chelators,"New tripodal metal chelating agents derived from nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and enhanced with the three unnatural amino acids D-penicillamine (D-Pen) are presented. In fact, D-Pen is the drug most commonly used to treat copper (Cu) overload in Wilson's disease and as such is a very attractive building block for chelating agent development. D-Pen is also a bulkier analog of cysteine with the beta methylene hydrogens replaced with larger methyl groups. The hindrance of the gem-dimethyl group in the vicinity of the thiol functions was shown to affect the speciation and stability of the metal complexes. Ligands L(4) (ester) and L(5) (amide) were obtained from NTA and commercial D-pen synthons in four and five steps with overall yields of 14 and 24 %, respectively. Their ability to bind Cu(I) thanks to their three thiolate functions has been studied using both spectroscopic and analytical methods. UV, CD, and NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry reveal the formation of two Cu(I) complexes with L(5): the mononuclear complex CuL(5) and a cluster (Cu2L(5))2. In contrast, the bulkier ethyl ester derivative L(4) cannot take up the mononuclear complex in solution and therefore exclusively forms the cluster (Cu2L(4))2. Cu K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS and EXAFS) confirms that Cu(I) is present in all of these complexes in all-sulfur trigonal-planar environments with Cu---S distances ranging from 2.22 to 2.23 Å is bound C3-symmetric CuS3 cores are coordination modes commonly adopted in Cu(I) proteins such as metallothioneins.

124,Clinical considerations for effective drug therapy in Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive copper overload disorder that results in hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. More than a century after Wilson's disease was first described, available medical treatments are not standardized. The efficacy of commonly used drugs is satisfactory in liver disease but disappointing in neurological patients, including the risk of neurological deterioration after initiation of chelation therapy. One approach to overcoming this problem is the careful and systematic assessment of biochemical response patterns and quantitative monitoring of symptoms using validated rating scales. Standardized dosing strategies that address changes in copper pools could improve adherence and reduce side effects. Such an approach can reduce long-term morbidity. In this paper, we discuss considerations for effective medical treatment and requirements for future studies in Wilson's disease. Copyright © 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.",,"Weiss, K.

125,AP1S1 defect causing MEDNIK syndrome: a new adaptinopathy associated with defective copper metabolism,"The MEDNIK syndrome (mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, neuropathy, ichthyosis and keratoderma) has recently been described as a new disorder of copper metabolism. This multisystem disease combines clinical and biochemical features of both Menkes and Wilson diseases in which hepatic copper overload is treatable with zinc acetate therapy. MEDNIK syndrome is caused by a mutation in the AP1S1 gene, which encodes the Sigma1A subunit of adapter protein complex 1 and controls intracellular transport of the copper pumps ATP7A and ATP7B. Adapter protein complexes regulate assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles, sorting of protein cargo, and vesicle transport between organelles in eukaryotic cells. A growing number of diseases have been associated with mutations in genes encoding subunits of adapter protein complexes, and we propose the term adaptinopathies for them as a new organic category of intracellular trafficking disorders that offer the possibility of involvement in the interaction analyze the mechanisms involved between the Golgi apparatus and the other organelles.

Unfortunately, most patients are brought to our attention after they have developed serious complications such as brain damage or cirrhosis, even though effective treatments are available. Diagnosis is usually made by measuring copper in liver tissue, followed by confirmation by genetic testing of the ATP7B gene. There are currently no effective biomarkers or methods suitable for screening newborns for Wilson disease. Ceruloplasmin has been tested for pediatric and neonatal screening with limited results. Recently, liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (LC-MRM-MS) has emerged as a robust technology that can enable multiplex quantification of characteristic low-abundance proteotypic peptides.

The treatment of WM patients with mild liver disease is not well defined. To address this issue, we evaluated the long-term outcomes of three treatment regimens (D-penicillamine, zinc, or both) in patients diagnosed in childhood. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed efficacy, compliance, and reasons for treatment discontinuation in 42 WM patients (mean age at diagnosis: 6 years; mean follow-up: 12 years) with mild liver disease. Duration of treatment for each treatment block until a medication change or completion of follow-up was analyzed. Treatment change events were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Overall discontinuations due to treatment failure or adverse events were more common in patients receiving D-penicillamine (45%) or combination therapy (36%) than in patients receiving zinc (12%) (p=0.001 and p=0 .02 , respectively). Treatment failure was more common with D-penicillamine (28%) and combination therapy (36%) than with zinc (12%); the difference was statistically significant only between zinc and combination therapy (p=0.03). First-line zinc monotherapy controlled WM-related liver disease in 13/15 patients (87%); the two subjects that failed on zinc were poorly adherent. Zinc was effective in 3/5 (60%) patients who failed D-penicillamine and combination therapies. All 15 D-penicillamine responders who were switched to zinc had good liver disease control with a median follow-up of 13.1 years. Of 6 D-penicillamine non-responders who were switched to zinc, 4 (67%) responded. At the conclusion of follow-up, only 5 of 42 (12%) patients failed. Discontinuation induced by adverse events was significantly more common in patients receiving D-penicillamine than in patients receiving zinc (p=0.03).

Medications such as penicillamine, trientine, and zinc salts are the mainstay of treatment with good results; However, non-responders or non-compliance with drug treatment can lead to disease progression and acute liver failure (ALF). Current treatment for WD with ALF is emergency liver transplantation and lifelong immunosuppression. Human hepatocyte transplantation (HTx) is increasingly used to treat liver-based metabolic defects. HTx may benefit WM patients with ALF, either as temporary support until chelation treatment takes effect, or as a definitive cure by repopulating the liver with healthy donor cells, as shown in animal models of WM. Although clinical trials of HTx have already demonstrated safety and efficacy in various ALF etiologies, this has yet to be demonstrated in cases of WD in a similar way.

134,D-penicillamine versus zinc sulfate as first-line treatment for Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare the course of treatment in patients with symptomatic Wilson's disease (WD) receiving either D-penicillamine (DPA) or zinc sulfate (ZS) as first-line therapy. METHODS: A total of 143 consecutive patients diagnosed with symptomatic WM from January 2005 to December 2009, followed by December 2010, were included. The decision on first-line therapy was made individually after consultation with the patient. Physicians had no clear preference for one drug over the other. Data were analyzed in subgroups with predominantly neurologic (DPA, 35; TS, 21) and hepatic (DPA, 36; TS, 51) presentation of WD. RESULTS: According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, neurological WM patients scheduled for DPA had a similar likelihood of not continuing first-line therapy as patients receiving ZS (20% vs. 24% at the end of follow-up). up), with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.9 (95% CI 0.2-3.5). In patients with hepatic WD, this probability was significantly higher for DPA (31% vs. 12%; adjusted OR 3.0, 95% CI 0.9-9.9), especially in the first 6 months. Early deterioration occurred only in neurological WM patients, with no difference between the two treatment groups (35% vs. 19%; OR 2.8, 95% CI 0.7-10.8). Neurological improvement and liver enzyme decreases were achieved with similar frequency. Compliance with DPA was better in liver patients (97% vs. 80%) but not in neurological patients (91% vs. 81%). Drug side effects were more common with DPA (15% vs. 3%). CONCLUSIONS: DPA and ZS are effective in the majority of WM patients. Neither therapy appears to be clearly superior. Therefore, ZS as a first-line therapy can be considered a reasonable alternative to DPA.

TWD patients had significantly lower copper metabolism parameters, higher total AOP and higher GSH levels than TWD patients; however, no difference was observed between these two patient groups with respect to the remaining parameters of antioxidant capacity.

These data suggest that anti-copper treatment affects copper metabolism and improves, but does not normalize, natural antioxidant capacity in patients with WM. We propose to conduct studies aimed at evaluating the utility of antioxidants as well as selenium as adjunctive therapy in WM.",,"Gromadzka, G.;Karpinska, A.;Przybylkowski, A.;Litwin, T.;Wierzchowska-Ciok, A.;Dziezyc, K.;Chabik, G.;Czlonkowska, A.",2014,Feb,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10534-013-9694-3,0,1,
136,Worsening of Wilson's disease after penicillamine therapy,"BACKGROUND: Penicillamine is a standard therapy for Wilson disease (WD), but paradoxical deterioration occurs in some patients. Predictors of such deterioration were not assessed. This study documents the frequency and predictors of worsening after treatment of WM. METHODS: 59 consecutive patients with neurological WM and 4 asymptomatic siblings were prospectively evaluated. Their clinical, laboratory, abdominal ultrasound, and skull MRI findings with and without deterioration were compared. Patients were treated with oral penicillamine and/or zinc and were followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months or earlier if needed. Worsening was defined as a >10% deterioration in Burke-Fahn-Marsden score at baseline or the emergence of new neurological signs. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 13 years and 13 were women. 19 patients (30.2%) worsened after treatment; 10 within 1 month, 7 in 1-3 months and 2 after 3 months of treatment. Worsening was associated with drooling, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and evidence of chronic liver disease. The condition did not deteriorate in any of the asymptomatic patients after zinc therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In the deteriorating group, cessation of penicillamine resulted in improvement/stabilization in 11 patients, 2 improved on trientine therapy, and 4 continued to deteriorate through 3 months. 30.2% of patients with WD worsened after penicillamine, particularly in patients with chronic liver disease, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.

137,Conformal treatment with anti-copper agents prevents clinically manifest Wilson's disease in pre-symptomatic patients,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism that results in dysfunction of affected tissues, primarily in the liver and brain. Anti-copper treatment should prevent clinically overt WM in pre-symptomatic patients, but this has not been supported by strong evidence. Our aim was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of treatment in clinically pre-symptomatic patients, with a particular focus on patient compliance with treatment. METHODS: Data from 87 consecutive patients without clinical symptoms of WM, identified through family screening between 1957 and 2009, were analyzed. All of them had been treated with either zinc sulfate (Zn) (66.7%) or D-penicillamine (DPA) (33.3%) since diagnosis. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12 years (range 3-52), 55 (63%) patients remained asymptomatic, 13 (15%) developed neuropsychiatric symptoms, and 21 (24%) developed hepatic dysfunction, including five deaths from liver failure. Non-compliance was observed for at least three consecutive months in 39 patients, and for more than 12 months in 29 cases. Multivariate analysis showed that noncompliance independently increased the likelihood of developing symptomatic WM (odds ratio 24.0, 95% confidence interval 6.0-99.0). According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients who adhered to treatment were significantly more likely to remain symptom-free and their overall survival was similar to the survival rate observed in the general population. CONCLUSION: Use of anti-copper agents in clinically pre-symptomatic patients diagnosed with WM provides effective prevention of clinically manifest disease. However, adherence to therapy is extremely important.

138,Mowat-Wilson syndrome: deafness in the first Egyptian case conceived by intracytoplasmic sperm injection,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions of the zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox-2 (ZEB2) gene. The syndrome is characterized by typical facial features, moderate to severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, and variable congenital anomalies including Hirschsprung disease, genital anomalies, congenital heart defects, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and ocular defects. The prevalence of Mowat-Wilson syndrome is currently unknown, but it appears that Mowat-Wilson syndrome is underdiagnosed, particularly in patients without Hirschsprung disease. We report here the first Egyptian case of Mowat-Wilson syndrome conceived by intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The patient presented with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss - a novel feature not previously reported in cases of Mowat-Wilson syndrome. This report describes the first Egyptian patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome conceived after intracytoplasmic sperm injection and provides new evidence for the implication of deafness in the congenital defects of the syndrome.

139,Metal storage diseases: Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis,"Hereditary hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease are autosomal recessive storage diseases of iron and copper overload, respectively. These metals are involved in several redox reactions, and their abnormal accumulation can cause significant damage in the liver and other organs. Over the past few decades, clinicians have developed a much better understanding of these metals and their mechanism of action. In addition, sophisticated molecular genetic testing techniques are now available, making diagnostic testing less invasive.

140,Evaluation of trace elements in the human brain using mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma,"Recent brain research shows a major role for trace elements in various diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Wilson's disease. The majority of published tissue concentrations are decades old and have been assessed using various methods. Little is known about hemispheric differences, the correlation of trace elements, or age-related changes in the human brain. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the trace element concentrations in different human brain regions after whole-brain formalin fixation. 549 samples from 13 brain regions were examined in 11 deceased subjects with no known history of brain pathology. Regional wet-to-dry mass ratios and concentrations of iron, copper, magnesium, manganese, calcium and zinc were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Cortical gray matter showed higher water content (wet-to-dry mass ratios 5.84-6.40) than white matter regions (wet-to-dry mass ratios 2.95-3.05). Element concentrations showed specific regional differences. A good linear correlation of the concentrations between the elements was found for both iron/copper and manganese/magnesium (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 0.74 and 0.65, respectively). Significant interhemispheric differences were found for copper in the occipital white matter, for magnesium and calcium in the putamen, and for iron and copper in the temporal white matter. Age-related increases were observed in cortical gray matter for calcium, for magnesium in all regions except cortical gray matter, for copper in the substantia nigra, and for zinc in the occipital cortex. The trace element concentrations shown can serve as a basis for further brain research. Wet to dry mass ratios allow comparison with reference data from other studies. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

141,Potent and long-lasting inhibition of human P2X2 receptors by copper,"P2X receptors are ion channels controlled by ATP. In rodents, these channels are modulated by zinc and copper. Zinc is released along with neurotransmitters at some synapses and can modulate neuronal activity, but copper's role in the brain is unclear. Rat P2X2 receptors are potentiated by 2-100 mM zinc or copper in the presence of submaximal ATP concentration, but are inhibited by zinc or copper at concentrations above 100 mM. In contrast, human P2X2 (hP2X2) receptors show no potentiation and are strongly inhibited by zinc over the range of 2-100 muM. The effect of copper on hP2X2 is of interest because there are human brain diseases in which the concentration of copper is altered. We found that hP2X2 receptors are strongly inhibited by copper (IC50 = 40 nM). ATP responsiveness recovered extremely slowly after copper leaching, requiring over 1 h for full recovery. ATP binding facilitated copper binding but not detachment from this inhibitory site. A mutant receptor deleted for the first six extracellular cysteines, C(1-6)S, showed normal copper inhibition, but reducing agents accelerated recovery from copper inhibition in wild-type hP2X2 and the C(1-6)S mutant dramatically, suggesting that the last two disulfide bonds are required to maintain the high affinity copper binding site. Three histidine residues required for normal zinc inhibition were also required for normal copper inhibition. People with untreated Wilson's disease have excess amounts of copper in the brain. The high copper sensitivity of the hP2X2 receptors suggests that they are nonfunctional in these patients. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,"Punthambaker, S.;Hume, R.

Diagnosis of WM was made 8 months previously based on abnormal parameters of copper metabolism and confirmed by genetic testing. The patient initially presented with akathisia, sialorrhea, oromandibular dystonia (occasionally grimacing), and mild dysarthria. The patient's symptoms subsided after starting treatment with D-penicillamine. No further deterioration was observed after starting copper chelation therapy. The authors diagnosed acute focal dystonia induced by clomipramine. Botulinum toxin and intensive rehabilitation was initiated; complete regression of hand dystonia was observed.

145,Clinical efficacy and safety of chelation treatment with typical penicillamine cross-combined with DMPS repeated for Wilson's disease,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of repeated chelation treatment with penicillamine (PCA) cross-combined with sodium 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate (DMPS) in patients with Wilson's disease (WD). 35 patients with WD were included. They were given DMPS intravenously in cross combination with oral PCA in alternation, which was practiced again and again, now all with zinc. Clinical observations and 24-hour urinary copper excretion as well as side effects of medication were recorded and analyzed during treatment. Although the incidence of side effects did not differ significantly after either intravenous DMPS or oral PCA treatment, 24-hour urinary copper levels tended to be higher after short-term intravenous DMPS administration than after oral PCA treatment. Side effects during the course of intravenous DMPS were mainly neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, allergic reaction and bleeding tendency. Compared to oral PCA alone or intravenous DMPS alone, such repeated cross-combination treatment could avoid continued drug side effects or poor healing effect as much as possible and had a lower chance of discontinuing treatment in WM patients. Improved or recovered liver function in 71% of patients, alleviation of neurological symptoms in 50% of patients, and resolution of hematuria in 70% of patients could be observed during the follow-up period of 6 months to 5 years after such a combined chelation regimen. Repeated chelation treatment with oral penicillamine cross-combined with intravenous DMPS may be more beneficial for WM patients to relieve symptoms, avoid persistent drug side effects, and maintain lifelong therapy.",,"Xu, S.

147,"Wilson's disease, 100 years later","Texts published by Sir K. Wilson about his disease of the same name in Brain, The Lancet and La Revue Neurologique in 1912, i.e. 100 years ago, underline the relevance of his descriptions in the light of current knowledge. Wilson's evocation of an ""unknown toxin"" seems prophetic intuition today, since the presence of excess copper in the liver was first mentioned a year later, while copper's role in this disease was not described until 1929. Advances have been made to better understand the physiology of Wilson's disease (WD). The ATP7B gene involved in WD is located on chromosome 13 and to date more than 500 mutations and 100 polymorphisms have been identified. The phenotypic expression is also very variable within a family. This can be partially explained by environmental factors such as diet. Modulator genes are also involved in the phenotypic expression of the disease. Most of the symptoms observed in WM were described in detail by Wilson as early as 1912, but further advances were made over the next 100 years to help physicians diagnose WM. Hepatic and neurological symptoms are the most common manifestations of the disease. Other extrahepatic features include renal manifestations, osteoarticular disorders, myocardial abnormalities, endocrine disorders suggestive of multisystemic disease. The diagnosis of the disease is based on a combination of clinical symptoms, biological, radiological and genetic data, and new tools (brain MRI, relatively exchangeable copper ...) allow reducing the delay to diagnosis. Therapeutic findings have also changed the disease prognosis. Treatment is based on the use of copper chelators to promote copper elimination from the body (D-penicillamine and triethylenetetramine) and zinc salts to reduce copper absorption. Tetrathiomolybdate appears to be a promising treatment. Although significant advances have been made in this century, many physiological aspects of this disease remain unknown and require further research to find answers over the next 100 years.

152,Alterations in cortical excitability and central motor conduction time in Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) results in widespread structural changes in the central nervous system, and our aims were to determine the cortical excitability changes in WD using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Thirteen patients with WD, diagnosed by the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring and biochemical tests, were examined. TMS was performed using a figure-8 coil attached to a Magstim 200 stimulator. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded at rest from the right first dorsal intermediate bone. Resting motor threshold (RMT) was determined using standard techniques and central motor conduction time (CMCT) by the 'F' wave method. The comparison was made with control data from our laboratory. Dysarthria was the main symptom in 5 patients (38.5%) and chorea, tremor, dystonia and abnormal gait in 2 patients each (15.4%). RMT was recordable in 10 patients and non-recordable in 3. Compared to controls, patients in whom RMT was recordable had significantly higher mean RMT (80.9 +/- 14.8 vs. 41.1 +/- 7, p<0.0001) and CMCT (6.7+ /- 0.5 ms vs. 4.8 +/- 0.6 ms; p<0.0001). In 2 of the 3 patients with non-registerable RMT, MEP could be achieved with active contraction. The CMCT was also prolonged in these 2 patients. Patients with WD have reduced cortical excitability and prolonged CMCT, which may be due to the intracortical presynaptic motor dysfunction. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

153,Gastrointestinal side effects in children with Wilson's disease treated with zinc sulfate,"AIM: To study the side effects of zinc sulfate therapy in a cohort of Polish pediatric patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 53 pediatric patients with Wilson's disease treated with zinc sulfate between 1996 and 2011 at the Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw, Poland. Patients were diagnosed with Wilson's disease according to Ferenci's scoring system, with 49 cases confirmed by mutation analysis. Data on the zinc sulfate dosing regimen, side effects, and treatment efficacy and toxicity were collected and recorded in the patient's medical record at each visit to the hospital. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis for the entire cohort was 10 years (range 2.5-17 years). The duration of treatment with zinc sulfate was 83.3 weeks (range 8-344 weeks). Adverse reactions, all of gastrointestinal origin, were observed in 21 patients (40% - 9 males and 12 females) regardless of the duration of therapy. 13 of 21 patients were older than 10 years. The most common ATP7B mutation was p.H1069Q. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed in 7 patients (33.3%) with persistent and severe abdominal pain revealed gastrointestinal ulceration or erosion with negative Helicobacter pylori tests in all subjects examined. The above 7 patients were treated with proton pump inhibitors. Three of them experienced symptom relief, while proton pump inhibitors failed to relieve symptoms in the remaining four children and required a switch from therapy to D-penicillamine.

Copper overload inevitably leads to progressive liver and neurological dysfunction. Copper overload in patients with Wilson's disease is caused by impairment of the biliary pathway for excretion of dietary copper. A combination of neurological, psychiatric, and hepatic symptoms can complicate the diagnosis of Wilson disease. Most symptoms appear in the second and third decades of life. The disease affects between one in 30,000 and one in 100,000 people and is fatal if left untreated. Five drugs are currently available to treat Wilson's disease: British Anti-Lewisite; D-penicillamine; trientine; zinc sulfate or acetate; and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. Any drug can lower copper levels and/or convert copper to a form that is metabolically inert and unavailable to the patient.

From 2000 to 2009, eight patients with WD referred to our facility for LT were enrolled in this study. The mean patient age was 15.9 years (range: 7-37 years). Four patients could not receive LT because no donors were available. All four patients were treated with chelating agents. Three of them (two of two patients with fulminant MV and one of two patients with cirrhotic MV) who did not undergo LT are still alive and doing well with stable liver function tests. Only one of the patients with cirrhotic WD who did not undergo LT died from liver failure. Even among the four patients who underwent LT, one with fulminant WD recovered from hepatic encephalopathy with apheresis therapy and chelating agents. He later required LT for severe neutropenia from D-penicillamine. The other three patients who underwent LT recovered and were doing well. Some of the patients with WD can recover and avoid LT with medical treatment. Even if WD has advanced liver cirrhosis and/or fulminant liver failure at the time of diagnosis, medical treatment should be attempted before considering LT.

159,Update on zinc deficiency and excess in clinical pediatric practice,"The vital importance of an adequate zinc status for human health, including normal growth and development, is undeniable. The high prevalence of zinc deficiency on a global scale and its importance to public health have been well documented by large randomized controlled zinc supplementation trials. However, similar evidence in the clinical setting is much less widespread due to the non-specific characteristics of zinc deficiency and the lack of sensitive biomarkers to detect zinc deficiency, particularly when it is mild in severity. Current understanding of zinc homeostasis indicates that the primary determinants of zinc absorption are the amount of zinc ingested and dietary phytate, with the latter having a major impact on zinc bioavailability. In normal as well as in many pathological conditions, the gastrointestinal tract is the major site of zinc loss resulting from the secretion of endogenous zinc into the lumen and subsequent excretion in the faeces. The amount excreted depends on the status of the host, the amount absorbed and sometimes the presence of pathophysiological conditions including diarrhea and steatorrhea. Assessment in the clinical setting requires that the physician take a careful medical and nutritional history, recognize clinical presentations where zinc supply may be compromised, and relate this risk to nonspecific but plausible manifestations of deficiency. Examples discussed in this article include primary zinc deficiency due to inadequate nutrition (older breastfed infants or young children without zinc-rich complementary foods); genetically determined deficiency (acrodermatitis enteropathica, acquired zinc deficiency of lactogenic origin) and acquired secondary deficiency in low birth weight and preterm birth, gastrointestinal and liver diseases and cystic fibrosis. Evidence for the efficacy of zinc therapy at pharmacological doses for two conditions, Wilson's disease and viral upper respiratory tract infections, is also discussed. Copyright © 2013 S.

160,Congenital disorders of copper metabolism,"Two copper-transporting ATPases are essential for mammalian copper homeostasis: ATP7A, which mediates copper uptake in the gastrointestinal tract and copper delivery to the brain, and ATP7B, which mediates copper excretion through the liver into the bile. Mutations in ATP7A can cause three distinct X-linked conditions in infants, children, or adolescents: Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and a newly identified allelic variant restricted to motor neurons called X-linked distal hereditary motor neuropathy. These three disorders present different neurological findings and age of onset. Menkes disease presents in the first few months of life with failure to thrive, developmental delay, and seizures. OHS features more subtle developmental delays, dysautonomia, and connective tissue abnormalities that begin in early childhood. ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy has an even later onset, often as late as adolescence or early adulthood, and involves a neurological phenotype resembling Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 disease. These disorders can be treated with copper replacement or ATP7A gene therapy. In contrast, mutations in ATP7B cause a single known phenotype, Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive trait that results from copper overload rather than deficiency. Dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, gait disturbances, and psychiatric problems may present symptoms between the ages of 10 and 40. There are excellent treatment options for Wilson's disease based on copper chelation. In the last 2 years (2012-2013) three new autosomal recessive states of copper metabolism have been identified: 1) Huppke-Brendel syndrome caused by mutations in an acetyl-CoA transporter required for the acetylation of one or more copper proteins, 2) CCS deficiency caused by mutations in the copper chaperone to SODI, and 3) MEDNIK syndrome, which showed that mutations in the Sigma1A subunit of adapter protein complex 1 (AP-1) have adverse effects on ATP7A and ATP7B transport .

From a dermatological point of view, penicillamine proved useful in the treatment of systemic sclerosis. The successful therapeutic uses of penicillamine have been hampered by its numerous adverse effects, both cutaneous and extracutaneous. It is a unique drug as it produces a variety of dermatological manifestations including (1) acute hypersensitivity reactions, (2) dermopathies characterized by elastic fiber abnormalities including elastosis perforans serpiginosa and pseudo-pseudoxanthoma elasticum, (3) autoimmune diseases such as pemphigus and penicillamine-induced lupus erythematosus-like syndrome and (4) various dermatoses resulting from undefined mechanisms. These cutaneous adverse reactions may correlate with the dosage and duration of penicillamine therapy, as well as the disease being treated.",,"Ishak, R.;Abbas, O.",2013,Jun,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40257-013-0022-z,0,0,

Liver histology showed macrovesicular steatosis with fibrosis but no cirrhosis. The disease was treated with D-penicillamine for 3 years until acute right upper quadrant symptoms led to evidence of multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma, which was successfully resected. Histological examination confirmed the malignancy of the 4 lesions classified as poorly differentiated grade 3 hepatocellular carcinoma according to Edmondson and Steiner. The non-tumor parenchyma showed 80% steatosis with ballooned cells, lobular inflammation, septal fibrosis, but no cirrhosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma is rare in Wilson's disease, particularly in the absence of cirrhosis. The 28 cases published in the literature are reviewed and the contributing role of copper in the hepatocarcinogenic process is discussed.",,"Thattil, R.;Dufour, J.

163,Brain metal accumulation in Wilson's disease,"INTRODUCTION: The accumulation of metals in the brain has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Only copper was examined in Wilson's disease (WD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the copper, iron, manganese and zinc concentrations in autopsy tissue samples from the brain of WM patients. METHODS: The study material consisted of 17 brains (12 WM patients, 5 controls) obtained at autopsy. Samples were taken from four different regions of each brain: frontal cortex, putamen, pons and dentate nucleus. Copper, manganese and zinc were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and iron was evaluated by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. The results were analyzed according to selected clinical variables. RESULTS: The copper content was homogeneously increased in all examined structures of the WD brains compared to the controls (41.0 +/- 18.6 µg/g vs. 5.4 +/- 1.8 µg/g; P< 0.01). Mean concentrations of iron, manganese, and zinc were similar in WD and controls, but iron levels in the dentate nucleus were higher in WD than controls (56.8 +/- 14.1 µg/g vs. 32.6 + /- 6.0 µg/g). G; P<0.05). Gender, age, and type and duration of WM treatment did not affect brain metal accumulation, but some correlations between disease duration and copper and iron accumulation were observed. CONCLUSIONS: During the course of WD, copper accumulates equally in different parts of the brain. Zinc and manganese do not appear to be involved in WD pathology, but elevated levels of iron have been found in the dentate nucleus. Therefore, additional studies on brain iron accumulation in WM are needed. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Litwin, T.;Gromadzka, G.;Szpak, G.

165,Trientine reduces BACE1 activity and alleviates amyloidosis via the AGE/RAGE/NF-kappaB pathway in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease,"OBJECTIVES: There is increasing evidence that the transition metal copper may play an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (trientine), a CuII-selective chelating agent, is a commonly used treatment for Wilson's disease to reduce accumulated copper and thereby reduce oxidative stress. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of 3-month treatment with trientine (Trien) on amyloidosis in 7-month-old beta-amyloid (Abeta) precursor protein and presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) double transgenic (Tg) AD model mice. RESULTS: We observed that triene reduced the level of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and decreased Abeta deposition and synapse loss in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. Importantly, we found that triene blocked the receptor for AGEs (RAGE), downregulated beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), inhibited amyloidogenic APP cleavage, and subsequently reduced Abeta levels. In vitro, triene-mediated downregulation of BACE1 via inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling occurred in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing the mutant Swedish APP. INNOVATION: In this study, we have shown for the first time that triene inhibits amyloidogenic signaling pathways, including targeting RAGE and NF-kappaB downregulation. CONCLUSION: Triene may mitigate amyloidosis in AD by inhibiting the RAGE/NF-kappaB/BACE1 pathway. Our study indicates that triene could be a viable therapeutic strategy for the intervention and treatment of AD and other AD-like pathologies.",,"Wang, C. Y.;Xie, J. W.;Xu, Y.;Wang, T.;Cai, J.

166,Discovery of human zinc deficiency: its implications for human health and disease,"The essentiality of zinc in humans was established in 1963. Enormous advances in both clinical and basic research into zinc metabolism in humans have been observed over the last 50 years. The main contributing factor to zinc deficiency is the high intake of phytate grain protein in the developing world, and nearly 2 billion people could be zinc deficient. Conditional zinc deficiency has been observed in patients with malabsorption syndrome, liver disease, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell anemia, and other chronic conditions. The major clinical problems arising from zinc deficiency in humans include growth retardation; cell-mediated immune dysfunction and cognitive impairment. In the Middle East, zinc-deficient dwarfs lived no older than 25 years and died of intercurrent infections. In 1963 we only knew 3 enzymes that required zinc for their activities, but now we know >300 enzymes and >1000 transcription factors that are known to require zinc for their activities. Zinc is a second messenger of immune cells and intracellular free zinc in these cells is involved in signaling events. Zinc has been used very successfully as a therapeutic modality to treat acute diarrhea in children, Wilson's disease, the common cold, and to prevent blindness in patients with age-related dry macular degeneration, and is very effective in reducing the incidence of infection in the elderly. In addition to modulating cell-mediated immunity, zinc is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory.",,"Prasad, A. S.",2013,2001-03-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.112.003210,0,0,

168,ZEB2 zinc finger missense mutations result in hypomorphic alleles and mild Mowat-Wilson syndrome,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a severe intellectual disability (ID) and facial physique syndrome with multiple congenital abnormalities, commonly associated with microcephaly, epilepsy, corpus callosum agenesis, conotruncal heart defects, urogenital anomalies, and Hirschsprung disease (HSCR ) goes hand in hand. MWS is caused by de novo heterozygous mutations in the ZEB2 gene. The majority of mutations result in haploinsufficiency due to premature stop codons or large gene deletions. Only three missense mutations have been reported to date; none of which reside in a known functional domain of ZEB2. In this study, we report and analyze the functional consequences of three novel missense mutations, p.Tyr1055Cys, p.Ser1071Pro, and p.His1045Arg, identified in the highly conserved C-zinc finger (C-ZF) domain of ZEB2. The patients' phenotype included facial features of MWS and moderate ID, but no microcephaly, cardiac defects, or HSCR. In vitro studies showed that all three mutations prevented binding and repression of the E-cadherin promoter, a characterized ZEB2 target gene. Using zebrafish morphant technology, we performed rescue experiments with wild-type (WT) and mutant human ZEB2 mRNAs. Variable, mutation-dependent embryo rescue was observed, which correlated with the severity of the patients' phenotype. Our data demonstrate that these missense mutations cause a partial loss of function of ZEB2, suggesting that its role is not limited to E-cadherin repression. Functional domains other than C-ZF may play a role in early embryonic development. Finally, these results broaden the clinical spectrum of ZEB2 mutations, suggesting that MWS should be considered in patients with lower ID and a suggestive facial shape, even in the absence of a congenital malformation.",,"Ghoumid, J.;Drevillon, L.;Alavi-Naini, S.

169,The effect of zinc and the role of p53 in copper-induced cellular stress responses,"Metals can directly or indirectly cause an increase in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells, which can lead to programmed cell death. A number of previous studies have shown that zinc (Zn) modulates mitogenic activity through multiple signaling pathways such as AKT, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), AP-1 and p53. The exact role that Zn plays in the regulation of apoptosis remains unclear. Intracellular free Zn modulates p53 activity and stability, and excess Zn alters p53 protein structure and downregulates p53 binding to DNA. Copper (Cu) accumulation causes apoptosis, which appears to be mediated by DNA damage and subsequent p53 activation. Cu can also displace Zn from its normal binding site on p53, leading to abnormal protein folding and disruption of p53 function. Despite the induction of the tumor suppressor p53, Cu accumulation in the liver significantly increases the risk of cancerous neoplasm in both humans and rats, suggesting that p53 function may be impaired in these cells. It is well known that imbalances in Cu and Zn levels can lead to a higher prevalence of p53 mutations. An increased number of p53 mutations were found in liver samples from patients with Wilson's disease (WD). High levels of the p53 mutation most likely contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer in individuals with WD, but cause and effect are not clear. The protein p53 also plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation of metallothionein, indicating a novel regulatory role for p53. This Review discusses the central role of p53 and the redox-inated metal Zn in the cellular stress responses induced by the redox-active biometal Cu.

170,Trientine-induced neurological deterioration in a patient with Wilson's disease,"Trientine (triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride) is a copper chelating agent used to treat patients with Wilson's disease (WD). It is considered safe and rarely causes neurological deterioration during initial treatment. We describe a patient diagnosed with WD who became neurologically disabled after treatment with trientine. In a liquid-damped inversion recovery sequence, brain MRI showed increased areas of high signal intensity compared to initial brain MRI. The patient's neurological symptoms partially resolved after stopping treatment with trientine.

171,Complex formation equilibria of Cu(II) and Zn(II) with triethylenetetramine and its mono- and diacetyl metabolites,"Triethylenetetramine (TETA) dihydrochloride or trientine is a therapeutic molecule that has long been used as a copper chelating agent for the second-line treatment of patients with Wilson's disease. More recently, it has also been used as an experimental therapeutic molecule in diabetes, where it improves cardiac structure in patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular hypertrophy. TETA is metabolized by acetylation, resulting in the formation of two major metabolites in humans and other mammals, monoacetyl-TETA (MAT) and diacetyl-TETA (DAT). These metabolites have been identified in the plasma and urine of healthy and diabetic subjects treated with TETA and may themselves play a role in TETA-mediated copper chelation and restoration of physiological copper regulation in diabetes. In this regard, a potentiometric and spectrophotometric study of the Cu(II) complexation equilibria of TETA, MAT, and DAT is presented here to provide a comprehensive assessment of the stoichiometries of the complexes formed and their relative stability constants. A potentiometric study was also performed on the corresponding Zn(II) complexes to assess a possible influence on TETA-mediated Cu(II) binding by this second physiological transition metal ion, which is present at similar concentrations in human plasma and which binds also to TETA. An ESI-MS study of these systems has both confirmed the complex formation mechanisms derived from the potentiometric and spectrophotometric results and provided direct information on the stoichiometry of the complexes formed in solution. Taken together, these data show that the 1:1 complexes formed with Cu(II) and Zn(II) have different degrees of protonation. The stability of the Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes with the three ligands, assessed by the parameters pCu and pZn, decreases with the introduction of the acetyl groups. Nevertheless, the stability of Cu(II) complexes with MAT is sufficiently high to allow its involvement in copper removal from the patient. A speciation study on the behavior of TETA and MAT with Cu(II) in the presence of Zn(II) at periphysiological plasma concentrations is also presented. While Zn(II) did not hinder copper binding, the possibility that prolonged TETA treatment could potentially alter the homeostatic regulation of this essential metal ion is raised. The lack of reliable stability constants from the literature regarding the Cu(II) and Zn(II) interaction with the major transport proteins in plasma is also briefly considered.",,"Nurchi, V.

172,A novel HPLC-electrochemical detection approach for the determination of D-penicillamine in skin samples,"D-penicillamine is a thiol drug used primarily in Wilson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cystinuria. Side effects with normal use of the drug are common and may include skin lesions. To evaluate its toxic effects in clinical cases, an original method based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with amperometric detection in a specific biological matrix such as the skin was developed. The chromatographic analysis of D-penicillamine was performed on a C18 column using a mixture of acidic phosphate buffer and methanol as the mobile phase. Satisfactory sensitivity was obtained by oxidizing the molecule at +0.95 V with respect to a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Chemical reduction of D-penicillamine protein disulfide bonds with dithioerythritol in combination with microwaves was required to determine the total amount of D-penicillamine in skin samples. Another solid phase extraction method was implemented on C18 cartridges for sample purification. The entire analytical procedure was validated: high extraction yields (> 91.0%) and satisfactory precision values (RSD < 6.8%) were obtained. It was successfully applied to skin samples from a patient who had previously been on long-term, high-dose treatment with the drug and had severe D-penicillamine-related dermatoses. Thus, the method appears suitable for the analysis of D-penicillamine in skin tissues. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Saracino, M.

The patient was treated with zinc sulfate for WD and with antidepressants for depression. Lithium was added in 2009 and antidepressants were discontinued in 2010. During treatment with zinc sulfate, a gradual improvement in liver function tests and a decrease in mandibulofacial dystonia were noted. In 2011, a hypomanic state appeared, which resolved with an increase in the dose of lithium. Since then the patient has mostly been in a euthymic mood with subclinical hypomanic phases.

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical presentation and long-term outcome and to examine the progression of hepatic histopathology in serial liver biopsies from WM patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 60 patients with WM treated with zinc and/or penicillamine. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected and 40 patients underwent an initial biopsy and at least one repeat biopsy. Patients were divided into two groups: progressors (patients with at least one fibrosis unit worsening) and non-progressors (patients with stable or improved fibrosis scores). RESULTS: A total of 33/40 (83%) patients (non-progressors) had stable liver histology or improvement. Seven of 40 (17%) patients (progressors) had worsening fibrosis. There was no significant correlation between the histological findings and the clinical parameters or initial presentation.

175,Do we need approved orphan drugs when compound drugs are available?,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND PURPOSE: Orphan drugs are used to diagnose, prevent or treat a rare disease. This comment aims to present a series of case studies that challenge the need to designate compound drugs with a long history of effective use well supported by published clinical evidence. COMMENT: Prior to the launch of orphan drugs, a drug mix was performed in our hospital pharmacy for several rare diseases. Examples include amifampridine for treating Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome (Firdapse()), ibuprofen for treating neonatal patent ductus arteriosus (Pedea()), and zinc acetate for treating Wilson's disease (Wilzin()). Several non-orphan drugs that have been used off-label to treat orphan diseases and have become orphan drugs include Hydrea() to treat sickle cell syndrome (Siklos()) and Viagra() to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (Revatio()). WHAT'S NEW AND CONCLUSION: In our opinion, as our examples show, a better balance should be found between the development of orphan drugs along the recently established regulatory pathways and the pragmatic use of pharmaceutically manufactured products and evidence-based off-label use of already available commercial ones Products. Societal needs would be best met if orphan drug development were focused on rare diseases that have high unmet medical needs.

177,Wilson disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that results in pathological accumulation of copper in many organs and tissues. The hallmarks of the disease are liver disease, neurological symptoms, and Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings. The leading neurological symptoms in WD are dysathria, dyspraxia, ataxia, and Parkinson-like extrapyramidal symptoms. The disease is characterized by changes in the basal ganglia in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In the presence of cirrhosis of the liver, some features may resemble hepatic encephalopathy. Symptoms and MRI abnormalities can be fully reversible with treatment with zinc or copper chelators. Improvement can be monitored by serial recording of brainstem-evoked responses. The basic defect is impaired copper transport in hepatocytes. ATP7B is the gene product of the WD gene, located on chromosome 13 and found in hepatocytes in the trans-Golgi network, where it transports copper into the secretory pathway where it is incorporated into apoceruloplasmin and excreted in the bile. While approximately 40% of patients present with neurological symptoms, little is known about the role of copper and ATP7B in the central nervous system. In some brain areas, such as the pineal gland, ATP7B is expressed and functionally active. Increasing evidence supports an important role for metals in neurobiology. Two proteins associated with neurodegeneration are copper-binding proteins (1) the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a protein associated with Alzheimer's disease, and (2) the prion protein associated with the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Copper is a major source of free radical production in the brain. To prevent metal-mediated oxidative stress, cells have evolved complex metal transport systems. APP is an important regulator of neuronal copper homeostasis and has a copper-binding domain (CuBD). The surface location of this site, the structural homology of CuBD to copper chaperones, and the role of APP in neuronal copper homeostasis are consistent with CuBD acting as a neuronal metallotransporter. There are several copper-containing enzymes in the brain, such as dopamine beta-hydroxylase or Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Their function can be altered due to copper overload. WD appears to be associated with a dopaminergic deficit. Mutations in the SOD1 gene cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The survival of transgenic mice with a mutant SOD1 that cannot incorporate Cu((2+)) into its active site was improved by copper depletion. Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder in which copper accumulates pathologically primarily in the liver and subsequently in the neurological system and many other organs and tissues. The presence of liver disease, neurological symptoms, and Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings are hallmarks of the disease.

178,Pathophysiology and clinical features of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting in pathologic accumulation of copper in many organs and tissues. ATP7B is the gene product of the Wilson disease gene located on chromosome 13 and found in hepatocytes in the trans-Golgi network, where it transports copper into the secretory pathway where it is incorporated into apoceruloplasmin and excreted in the bile. Mutations in the gene lead to impaired transport of copper into and through hepatocytes. More than 200 mutations in the Wilson disease gene have been found, the most common being H1069Q (in Europe) and R778L (in Asia). Wilson's disease can present under a variety of clinical conditions, usually as liver and/or neuropsychiatric disorders. The pathogenesis of hepatic and neurological Wilson's disease is a direct consequence of copper accumulation. The presence of copper causes oxidative stress that leads to cell destruction. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease requires a combination of various clinical symptoms, biochemical tests and the detection of gene mutations, which form the basis of a score proposed by a group of international experts. Initial treatment for symptomatic patients should include a chelating agent (penicillamine or trientine). Treatment of pre-symptomatic patients or maintenance therapy can also be carried out with zinc. [References: 60]",,"Ferenci, P.",2004,Dec,,0,0,
179,Pyridoxal isonicotinoylhydrazone (PIH) prevents copper-mediated free radical formation in vitro,"Pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) is an iron chelator with antioxidant activity, low toxicity, and is useful in the experimental treatment of iron overload diseases. Previous X-ray diffraction studies have shown that PIH also forms a complex with Cu(II). Because the main drug of choice to treat Wilson's disease, d-penicillamine, causes a range of side effects, there is an urgent need to develop alternative copper chelating agents for clinical use. These chelating agents must also exhibit antioxidant activity, as oxidative stress is associated with brain and liver copper overload. In this work, we tested the ability of PIH to prevent Cu(II), ascorbate, and dissolved O2 mediated free radical formation in vitro. The 10 microM Cu(II) and 3 mM ascorbate-mediated degradation of 2-deoxyribose was completely inhibited by 10 microM PIH (I50 = 6 microM) or 20 microM d-penicillamine (I50 = 10 microM). The antioxidant potency of PIH remained unchanged with increasing concentrations (from 1 to 15 mM) of the hydroxyl radical detector molecule 2-deoxyribose, suggesting that PIH does not act as a hydroxyl scavenger. On the other hand, the efficiency of PIH (against copper-mediated 2-deoxyribose degradation and ascorbate oxidation) was inversely proportional to Cu(II) concentration, indicating competition between PIH and ascorbate for complexation with Cu(II). Almost complete inhibition by PIH was observed when the PIH:copper ratio was 1:1. A similar result was obtained when measuring copper plus ascorbate mediated O2 uptake. In addition, spectral studies of the copper and PIH interaction revealed a peak at 455 nm and also indicated the formation of a stable Cu(II) complex with PIH in a 1:1 ratio. These data showed that PIH prevents the formation of hydroxyl radicals and oxidative damage to 2-deoxyribose by forming a complex with Cu(II) that does not react with ascorbate (first step of the reactions leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals from Cu(II ), ascorbate and lead O2) and does not participate in Haber-Weiss reactions.",,"Hermes-Lima, M.;Goncalves, M.

180,Structural and functional insights into the copper-transporting ATPase in Wilson disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The gene for this disorder has been cloned and identified to encode a copper-transporting ATPase (ATP7B), a member of a large family of cation transporters, the P-type ATPases. In addition to the core elements common to all P-type ATPases, Wilson's copper-transporting ATPase has a large cytoplasmic N-terminus that encompasses six heavy metal-associated (HMA) domains, each of which contains the copper-binding sequence motif GMT/HCXXC. Extensive studies addressing the functional, regulatory, and structural aspects of heavy metal transport by heavy metal transporters in general have provided great insight into copper transport by Wilson's copper-transporting ATPase. Findings from these studies were used together with homology modeling of the Wilson disease copper-transporting ATPases based on the X-ray structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium ATPase to present a hypothetical model of the mechanism of copper transport by copper-transporting ATPases.

Results were analyzed statistically and significance was accepted as meaningful if P < 0.05. In celiac disease patients, urinary copper levels were high (52 +/- 29 micrograms/day, P<0.000), but serum copper was the same as controls (105 +/- 16 micrograms/dl, P<0.158). High urinary copper levels occurred in celiac disease patients in females (56 +/- 30 micrograms/day) and males (33 +/- 17 micrograms/day, P<0.115). Most celiac patients were female (P < 0.001). Serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were higher in females than males in all groups, and this was higher for serum copper in the control group (P<0.045) and for ceruloplasmin in the Crohn's (P<0.055) and control groups (P<0.031) significant. Serum (70 +/- 14 micrograms/dl, P<0.000) and urine (25 +/- 15 micrograms/dl, P<0.039) zinc levels in celiac disease patients were low. Ceruloplasmin levels were higher in celiac disease patients (337 +/- 64 U/L) and Crohn's disease patients (366 +/- 47 U/L, P<0.000). Correlations in the groups celiac disease (P<0.029) and Crohn's disease (P<0.024), celiac disease and Wilson's disease (P<0.001) and Crohn's disease and Wilson's disease (P<0.001) between the parameters ceruloplasmin and copper in the 24-hour -urine were observed. AST and ALT levels were higher in celiac disease and Wilson patients than in Crohn's patients and controls. Mean CRP levels were significantly higher in Crohn's disease than others. Lymphocyte counts were significantly higher in celiac disease patients. While the mean iron, hemoglobulin, and hematocrit levels of the celiac disease and Crohn's groups were significantly lower than the normal and Wilson groups, they were statistically similar in the Wilson and control groups. Serum levels of copper (85 +/- 26 micrograms/dL, P<0.158) and ceruloplasmin (219 +/- 83 U/L, P<0.001) were low and 24-hour urinary copper levels were high (415 + /- 346 micrograms/day) in Wilson's group. Increased urinary leakage may be another cause of copper deficiency in female celiac disease patients, along with malabsorption, and this topic needs further investigation. Elevated levels of copper in the urine in women with celiac disease should not always be taken as a diagnosis of Wilson's disease.",,"Ince, A.

182,Liver structures of a patient with idiopathic copper toxicosis,"This is the first report describing the liver structures of a Japanese patient with idiopathic copper toxicosis, which should be differentiated from the hepatolenticular degeneration of Wilson's disease. An 11-year-old Japanese boy presented with ascites associated with biochemical liver damage. Involvement of the hepatitis virus was ruled out by laboratory tests. Because urinary copper excretion was increased, Wilson's disease was strongly suspected, but serum ceruloplasmin levels were normal and Kayser-Fleischer rings were not detected on slit-lamp examination. Brain images were within normal limits. ATP7B analysis was negative for mutations. Liver samples showed cirrhosis associated with chronic active hepatitis. Almost all hepatocytes were positive for granules stained with orcein. Mallory bodies were found in some hepatocytes. Fat change was minimal and there were no glycogenated nuclei in the parenchyma. Combined therapies with trientine and zinc for 6 months improved the decompensated state of liver function. After 2.5 years of treatment, a second liver biopsy was performed. The liver after the treatment showed a complete disappearance of portal inflammation and a remarkable decrease in cuprothionein granules. Mallory bodies disappeared from the parenchyma. Abundance of hepatocellular Mallory bodies and heavy copper exposure confined to the liver may be specific to idiopathic copper toxicosis.",,"Hayashi, H.;Shinohara, T.;Goto, K.;Fujita, Y.;Murakami, Y.;Hattori, A.;Tatsumi, Y.;Shimizu, A.;Ichiki, T.",2012,Jun,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00795-011-0556-1,0,0,

Laboratory findings showed normal serum copper (104 micrograms/dl), high urinary copper (2370 micrograms/dl) and low serum ceruloplasmin (14.3 micrograms/dl). A slit lamp exam showed Kayser-Fleischer rings on her cornea and she was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. Plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration relieved the severe condition, followed by laparoscopic examination. Administration of D-penicillamine and restriction of dietary copper (<1 mg/day) were initiated, resulting in normalized serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. After 3 years, she was re-examined laparoscopically and the laparoscopic and histological findings of her liver were apparently improved.

187,Wilson's disease: two treatment modalities. Correlations to brain MRI before and after treatment,"INTRODUCTION: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in Wilson's disease (WD) demonstrate lack of correlations between neurological and imaging features. Long-term follow-up reports of sequential brain MRI in patients with neurological MD comparing different treatment modalities are scarce. METHODS: Eighteen patients with neurological WM underwent pre- and post-treatment brain MRI scans to assess the spectrum of abnormalities and evolution over these different time periods. All patients had at least two MRI scans at different intervals up to 11 years after the start of treatment. The MRI findings were correlated with the clinical picture, the clinical severity, the duration of the neurological symptoms and the treatment with two different drugs. The patients were divided into two groups according to the treatment: D: -penicillamine (DP), zinc (Zn) and Zn after the onset of severe intolerance to DP. RESULTS: Pretreatment MRI scans showed hypersignal intensity lesions on T2 and proton density weighted images bilaterally and symmetrically at basal nuclei, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, cerebral cortex and white matter in all patients. The most common neurological symptoms were: dysarthria, parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, psychiatric disorders, dysphagia, risus sardonicus, ataxia, chorea and athetosis. CONCLUSIONS: From a neurological perspective, there was no difference in development between the DP-only group and the Zn-treated group. Analysis of MRI scans with longer intervals after treatment initiation showed a trend for neuroimaging deterioration with no neurological concordance in Zn-treated patients. The developmental pattern of neuroimaging was more favorable for the group receiving DP alone.",,"da Costa Mdo, D.;Spitz, M.;Bacheschi, L. A.;Leite, C. C.;Lucato, L. T.;Barbosa, E.

189,Copper transport and Alzheimer's,"This brief overview discusses human copper transport, focusing on knowledge learned from one of the simplest model organisms, yeast. Another focus is on copper transport in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Copper homeostasis is vital to the well-being of all organisms, from bacteria to yeast to humans: survival depends on maintaining copper supplies for the many enzymes that depend on copper for their activity, while also ensuring it that there is no excess free copper. which would lead to toxicity. A virtual orchestra of proteins is required to achieve copper homeostasis. To absorb copper, Cu(II) is first reduced to Cu(I) by a membrane-bound reductase. The reduced copper can then be internalized by a copper transporter, where it is transferred to copper chaperones for transport and specific delivery to various organelles. Of importance are the internal copper transporters ATP7A and ATP7B, which are notable for their role in copper deficiency disorders and toxicity, Menkes and Wilson's disease, respectively. Metallothioneins and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase can protect against excess copper in cells. It is also clear that increasing age, environmental and lifestyle factors affect brain copper. Studies in AD suggest an important role for copper in the brain, with some AD therapies focusing on copper mobilization in AD brains. The transport of copper to the brain is complex and involves numerous players, including amyloid precursor protein, A-beta peptide and cholesterol. [References: 58]",,"Macreadie, I.

190,Clinical correlation of brain MRI and MRS abnormalities in patients with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: The progression of Wilson's disease (WD), a disorder of copper metabolism, can be halted by chelation therapy. Despite adequate treatment, however, neurological deficits can persist. MRI is used to evaluate patients with WD, but previous attempts to correlate clinical course with examination findings have often been unsuccessful. AIM: To identify MR-visible markers that could help stratify disease severity and elucidate the mechanism of persistent neurological deficit after treatment. METHODS: MRI and proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) were performed in 17 patients with MV. MRI was semi-quantitatively assessed and used to locate volumes of interest (voxels) in the striatum for 1H-MRS. RESULTS: MRI showed abnormalities mostly restricted to patients with neurological features of WD. 1H spectra showed a reduction in N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (2.05 mM; p<0.01) in patients with neurological features but not in patients without clinical neurological involvement (0.42 mM; p>0 ,1) normal controls compared to patients of the same age. Choline was also reduced in both patient groups (0.08 mM; p<0.01) compared to age-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Wilson's disease who develop neurological features, there may be a biochemical correlate of tissue-specific dysfunction. These changes appear to be present despite prior clinical improvement and may indicate a need for additional treatment.",,"Page, R. A.;Davie, C. A.;MacManus, D.;Miszkiel, K. A.;Walshe, J.

In this study, an impairment profile is described using eight electrophysiological tests (EAEP, MSEP, TSEP, T-VEP, MEP, EEG, heart rate variability and SSR) for 37 patients (28 with neurological, nine with non-neurological form) under a long-term drug therapy. The occurrence of delayed wave III and/or IPL III-V prolongation in 64.3% of patients with the neurological form makes pathological FAEP the most common form of the disorder, followed by disorders in MSEP, TSEP, MEP and T-VEP. Patients with the non-neurological form usually have normal values, although in individual cases the latency is prolonged. The spectrum of the evoked potential findings is primarily characterized by an increase in latency, ie a demyelinating type of impairment. Significant potential losses hardly ever occur (except for MEP). The electrophysiological impairment profile does not include EEG changes or autonomic disorders.",,"Hermann, W.;Villmann, T.;Wagner, A.",2003,Oct,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00115-003-1564-8,0,0,
203,Practical recommendations and new therapies for Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper accumulation. The basic defect is a failure of the liver to excrete excess copper in the bile for loss in the stool. The resulting copper primarily damages the liver and the brain. Patients typically present in their second to fourth decades of life with liver disease, a movement disorder-type neurological disease, or a wide range of behavioral disorders. Because the manifestations of Wilson's disease are so diverse and the disease is so well hidden behind something else, recognizing the possibility of Wilson's disease is a major problem, leading to serious underdiagnosis of the disease. There are excellent therapies for both prophylaxis and treatment of Wilson's disease. The longer detection and diagnosis is delayed, the greater the risk of permanent liver and/or brain damage. The availability of effective therapy and the risks of delay or therapy make the earliest possible diagnosis crucial. Once the disease is considered, a number of diagnostic steps can be taken, almost always confirming or ruling out a diagnosis of Wilson's disease. These include urine copper, blood ceruloplasmin, slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings and liver biopsy with quantitative determination of copper. Currently, 4 drugs are used as anti-copper drugs in Wilson's disease. These are zinc, which blocks the intestinal absorption of copper, penicillamine and trientine, both of which are chelating agents that increase urinary excretion of copper, and tetrathiomolybdate, which forms a tripartite complex with copper and protein and blocks or releases copper absorption from the gut can blood copper non-toxic. Zinc is, in our opinion, clearly the treatment of choice for maintenance therapy, for treatment of the pre-symptomatic patient from onset, and for treatment of the pregnant patient, because of its complete efficacy and lack of toxicity. For the initial treatment of patients with mild liver failure, we empirically use a combination of trientine and zinc. Trientine produces a strong, rapid, negative copper balance, and zinc induces hepatic metallothionein, which sequesters hepatic copper. For the initial treatment of patients with neurological disorders, we use an experimental drug, tetrathiomolybdate, which allows for rapid and safe copper control. In these latter patients, there is a high risk of serious permanent neurological deterioration with penicillamine and, in our opinion, zinc acts too slowly to be optimal. [References: 46]",,"Brewer, G. J.",1995,Aug,,0,1,
204,Current therapy of chronic liver disease,"The study of chronic liver disease has been hampered by insufficient information regarding the pathogenesis of the many forms of hepatitis. As a result, well-designed treatment strategies are often lacking. Wilson's disease is characterized by excessive accumulation of copper in the liver and other organs. While D-penicillamine is clearly effective, many patients may not be able to tolerate its many side effects. Trientine, oral zinc, and unithiol have all shown promise as therapeutic alternatives. Autoimmune chronic active hepatitis responds well to prednisone and azathioprine. Cyclosporine has also resulted in clinical improvement in several case reports, but no comparison with current standard therapy has been made. Recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) has demonstrated the ability to inhibit hepatitis B viral replication, and the combination of oral corticosteroids followed by IFN alpha is more effective than either agent at eliminating viral replication in patients with chronic active hepatitis B alone. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) has no standard medical treatment, but corticosteroids and methotrexate may each play a future role in its management. Drug treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) has been disappointing, and early reports of success with D-penicillamine have not been confirmed in large, well-controlled studies. While some reports of multi-agent improvements have been described, larger studies are still needed. Alcoholic liver disease continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and numerous investigators have explored several different medical therapies. Reported successes with androgens and the antithyroid drug propylthiouracil in alcoholic liver disease need to be confirmed by other research before these agents can be recommended for routine use. Finally, colchicine may prove effective in slowing the rate of fibrosis in cirrhosis, but this has yet to be proven conclusively. [References: 89]",,"Stavinoha, M. W.;Soloway, R. D.",1990,Jun,,0,0,

214,Ion efflux systems involved in bacterial metal resistance,"The study of metal ion resistance gives us important insights into environmental processes and provides an understanding of fundamental life processes. This Review focuses on bacterial efflux systems for inorganic metal cations and anions, which have been commonly found as resistance systems in bacteria isolated from metal-polluted environments. The protein products of the genes involved are sometimes prototypes of new protein families or important new branches of known families. Sometimes a group of related proteins (and presumably the underlying physiological function) remains to be defined. For example, efflux of the inorganic metal anion arsenite is mediated by a membrane protein that functions alone in Gram-positive bacteria but requires an additional ATPase subunit in some Gram-negative bacteria. Resistance to Cd2+ and Zn2+ in Gram-positive bacteria is the result of a P-type efflux ATPase related to the copper transport P-type ATPases of bacteria and humans (defective in the human hereditary diseases Menkes syndrome and disease Wilson). In contrast, resistance to Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Cd2+ in Gram-negative bacteria relies on the action of proton-cation antiporters, members of a newly recognized protein family that has been implicated in diverse functions such as metal resistance/knot formation in legumes/cell division (hence the name of the family RND). Another new family of proteins, named CDF for ""cation diffusion promoter,"" prototypes the protein CzcD, which is a regulatory component of a cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance determinant in the gram-negative bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus. A family for the ChrA chromate resistance system in gram-negative bacteria has yet to be defined. [References: 102]",,"Nies, D. H.;Silver, S.",1995,Feb,,0,0,

However, on day 30, the second hemolytic crisis occurred and subsequent liver failure resulted in death on day 50. At autopsy, her liver was cirrhotic and showed massive necrosis. Therefore, prophylactic oral administration of D-penicillamine and careful monitoring is recommended to prevent hemolytic crisis during the perinatal period.",,"Shimono, N.;Ishibashi, H.;Ikematsu, H.;Kudo, J.;Shirahama, M.;Inaba, S.;Maeda, K.;Yamasaki, K.;Niho, Y.",1991,Feb,,0,0,

218,Copper and liver diseases,"There has been some limited progress in understanding the fundamental defect in Wilson's disease, and the gene in question has been localized to chromosomal region 13q14. Zinc treatment has emerged as a definitive alternative to the administration of penicillamine, and some shortcomings and/or dangers of both forms of therapy have become apparent as their modes of action have been more carefully studied. Tetrathimolybdate may have a place in treatment, particularly when rapid complexation of copper is important. Hepatic copper accumulation occurs in a number of cholestatic diseases and they play an important role in pathogenesis and can occasionally lead to neurological toxic effects. Copper overload in the neonatal period, when the biliary excretion of copper is inefficient, can trigger a vicious circle of copper accumulation and liver damage in childhood Indian cirrhosis and less commonly in babies in other countries.

220,Effects of long-term treatment in Wilson's disease with D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate,"The results of treatment with D-penicillamine (DP) or zinc sulfate (Zn) in 67 newly diagnosed cases of Wilson's disease were compared. All patients (7 with hepatic, 1 with psychiatric and 59 with neurological or preclinical forms) were fully compliant. During the 12-year follow-up, 34 patients received dP and 33 Zn as primary treatment. 15 patients (44%) discontinued the DP, in 10 cases due to side effects. Four (12%) patients discontinued Zn, in 2 cases because of side effects. In one patient receiving Zn, the condition deteriorated in the first few months after starting therapy. The efficacy of long-term treatment with DP and Zn was similar in those patients who were able to continue initial therapy. Zn was better tolerated than DP; We therefore propose that it may be recommended as initial therapy for patients in the preclinical stage of Wilson's disease or with neurological manifestations of the disease. Closer observation is required in patients with hepatic and psychiatric forms of the disease.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Gajda, J.;Rodo, M.",1996,Mar,,1,1,

Copper concentration measurements in the liquor were carried out in three patients from the start of therapy and in the fourth from 16 months after initial treatment. CSF copper levels slowly decreased over the years in parallel with clinical improvements and increased in one patient who had discontinued therapy for 2 years. These findings support our hypothesis that the concentration of CSF copper is a valuable quantitative parameter reflecting the normalization of brain copper. Copper measurements during periods of initial neurological deterioration in two patients receiving D-penicillamine and in one patient receiving D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate showed decreased free serum copper and CSF copper.",,"Hartard, C.;Weisner, B.;Dieu, C.;Kunze, K.",1993,Dec,,0,0,

The more copper was eliminated, the higher the glucose consumption of the basal ganglia. On the other hand, in seven patients treated for more than 7 years, a significant decrease in basal ganglia glucose consumption was observed, suggesting that the maintenance dose of DPA was too low.",,"Hefter, H.;Kuwert, T.;Herzog, H.;Arendt, G.;Stremmel, W.;Feinendegen, L.

There was a strong reduction in striatal and extrastriatal rCMRGlc as well as striatal [18F]MSP accumulation rate. After 1 year of treatment with D-penicillamine, the striatal and extrastriatal rCMRGlc and striatal [18F]MSP accumulation rate reached almost normal values.

Patients were scanned with spin echo (SE) sequences; The neurologist looked for typical symptoms: dysarthria, tremor, ataxia, rigidity/bradykinesia and chorea/dystonia. Pathologic MR findings, thought to be secondary to this unusual inherited disorder of copper metabolism, were found in twenty-two subjects. Focal abnormalities were seen in the lens, thalamus, and tail nuclei, as well as the brainstem and white matter; these lesions were best shown as areas of hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences. In eight patients we found diffuse cerebral atrophy with subsequent enlargement of the ventricular system. Five subjects showed mild, nineteen severe neurological deficits. In general, there was no correlation between MR findings and clinical neurological symptoms; the impairment of cellular metabolism that causes functional changes in the brain precedes morphological changes. There appeared to be a gradual progression of the disease during treatment with the copper chelator D-penicillamine. A shortening of the T1 relaxation due to the influence of paramagnetic copper was not observed; a possible explanation could be an intracellular deposition - a proton-electron-dipole-dipole interaction would therefore be excluded.",,"Prayer, L.;Wimberger, D.;Kramer, J.;Grimm, G.;Oder, W.;Imhof, H.",1990,,,0,0,

Serial investigations over 10 months after the start of treatment with D-penicillamine showed a normalization of the EMG responses. Pathophysiologically, the initially abnormal EMG responses probably resulted from a reversible impairment of impulse conduction along cortico-motor neuron pathways and/or a reduced excitability of cortical cells due to impaired basal ganglia function.",,"Meyer, B.

Striatal rCMRGlc was significantly reduced in the 4 patients who had recently started decoppering therapy compared to striatal rCMRGlc measured in the 10 patients with longer duration of treatment. Caudate rCMRGlc significantly correlated with various signs of extrapyramidal dysfunction. Cerebellar, thalamic, and cortical rCMRGlc correlated significantly with the severity of pyramidal signs.

To verify this observation, we studied 12 patients suffering from Wilson's disease in a preneurological stage using visual evoked potentials (VEPs), somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) for median nerve stimulation, and auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) of the brainstem. Four of these patients had not previously been treated with penicillamine or trientine (triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride), while the remaining 8 patients had been treated for at least 1 year.

The previously untreated patients showed an exaggerated humoral immune response, i.e. increased IgG and IgM levels, higher titers of antibodies against the Kunin antigen and a suppression of cell-mediated immunity, namely a reduced response to DNCB, reduced lymphocyte transformation after stimulation with Con A , PPD, Candida and streptokinase and a reduced response to streptokinase in the MIF test. After treatment, the humoral response normalized, and in the case of IgA and antibodies to S. typhi O antigen, it even fell below normal levels. The cell-mediated immune response normalized with the exception of lymphocyte transformation by PHA and Candida albicans. In in vitro studies, it was found that D-penicillamine had no effect on lymphocyte transformation when PHA and Con A were used as mitogens. With PPD as antigen, lymphocyte stimulation and migration inhibition were inhibited by concentrations of penicillamine ranging from 6 to 1000 micrograms/ml.",,"Czlonkowska, A.",1977,2002-12-01 00:00:00,,0,0,

We report a case of Wilson's disease with chronic liver disease; Furthermore, in our patient, who also presented with high levels of anxiety without depression, 99mTc-ECD-SPECT showed cortical hypoperfusion in the frontal lobes, which was more pronounced in the left frontal lobe. During our patient's follow-up, penicillamine was discontinued after the onset of lichenoid dermatitis and zinc acetate allowed the patient's successful treatment to continue without side effects. In our case, zinc acetate therapy was an effective treatment for a patient with Wilson's disease who was experiencing penicillamine-related side effects. The safety of zinc acetate allowed us to avoid other potentially toxic chelating agents; This observation is consistent with the growing evidence supporting the drug's effectiveness in treating Wilson's disease. Since most patients with Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine do not appear to develop this skin lesion, it may be possible that a specific genetic factor is involved in the drug response.

WD presents with liver disease, neurological or psychiatric disorders, or other less common clinical features. The diagnosis of WD is often difficult and can be formulated through clinical, biochemical, imaging, histochemical, and genetic studies. The pharmacologic approach to WD consists of copper chelators such as D-penicillamine, trientine, dimercaprol, and tetrathiomolybdate. In 1997, the US FDA approved zinc for maintenance treatment of WM. Orthotopic liver transplantation is indicated in fulminant liver failure, progressive liver failure despite therapy, cirrhosis with complications of portal hypertension.

DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE (December 1966-December 1996) search of the English language literature using the terms zinc and Wilson's disease was conducted to identify relevant clinical studies, reviews and case reports. Additional articles were selected from bibliographies of the reviewed literature. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Due to the rarity of the disease, all articles were considered for possible inclusion in this review. Single case reports are referenced but were not selected for analysis. DATA SYNTHESIS: Wilson's disease, an inherited disorder of copper metabolism, is fatal if left untreated. The chelating agents penicillamine and trientine have been the mainstay of therapy; However, side effects of chelating agents often interfere with successful treatment. Zinc acetate was recently approved in the US for maintenance therapy in patients initially treated with a chelating agent. Although studies evaluating large populations are lacking, zinc therapy has demonstrated exceptional safety and efficacy over a 40-year period. Zinc acetate can be used during pregnancy and to treat pre-symptomatic patients, although data do not support its use as monotherapy in patients with acute neurological or hepatic disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc acetate is an effective maintenance therapy for patients with Wilson's disease. The negligible toxicity compared to previously approved treatments is a major advantage.

Our aim was to assess treatment response to different therapies in a cohort of WM patients observed at a single center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an observational, descriptive study reviewing clinical, laboratory, and imaging data in a series of 20 WM patients with a median follow-up of 14 years. Mode of presentation, treatment applied, biochemical and copper homeostasis parameters were assessed. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 22 years. The most common mode of presentation was hepatic (n=10, 50%; mean age: 21.5 years), followed by neurological (25%; mean age: 34.5 years) and mixed (15%). Initial treatment in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients at the time of diagnosis was D-penicillamine in 90% and zinc (Zn) in 10%, respectively. Patients treated with d-penicillamine throughout the period had complete biochemical normalization (baseline ALT: 220 IU/L; last follow-up 38 IU/L). In contrast, patients who switched d-penicillamine to Zn, regardless of cause, did not show complete biochemical response (baseline ALT: 100 IU/L vs. 66 IU/L at last follow-up). CONCLUSIONS: The treatment was found to be effective in most cases, regardless of the drug used. However, side effects were common in patients treated with D-penicillamine agents and necessitated a switch to zinc. Zinc therapy was well tolerated and appeared to have good efficacy.

246,novel long-distance enhancer regulates postnatal expression of Zeb2: implications for Mowat-Wilson syndrome phenotypes,"The zinc-finger, E-box-binding homeobox-2 (Zeb2) gene encodes a SMAD-interacting transcription factor that has diverse roles in development and disease. Mutations at the hZeb2 locus cause Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS), a genetic disorder associated with intellectual disability and other case- and gender-dependent clinical features. Recent studies have detailed the microRNA-mediated control of Zeb2, but little is known about the genomic context of this gene or about enhancer sequences that might direct its various functions. Here we describe a novel transgenic rodent model in which the regulatory sequence of Zeb2 has been disrupted, resulting in a postnatal developmental phenotype that is autosomal dominant. The phenotype shows an interaction between genotype and sex and mainly manifests as acute attenuation of postnatal renal development in males. Other aspects of embryonic and neonatal development, including neuronal, are unaffected. The transgene insertion site is associated with a 12 kb deletion, 1.2 Mb upstream of Zeb2, within a 4.1 Mb gene desert. A conserved sequence derived from the deleted region enhanced the activity of the Zeb2 promoter in transcription assays. The tissue and temporal limitation of this enhancer activity may involve postnatal changes in proteins that bind this sequence. A control human/mouse VISTA enhancer (62 kb upstream of Zeb2) also upregulated the Zeb2 promoter, providing evidence for a panel of conserved distal enhancers. The phenotype resulting from the deletion of one copy of the extreme long-distance enhancer indicates a critical role for this enhancer at a developmental stage. Zeb2 haploinsufficiency in this developmental context reflects the inheritance of MWS and may underlie some sex-dependent, non-neural features of this human-inherited disorder.",,"El-Kasti, M.

247,Copper imbalances in ruminants and humans: unexpected similarities,"Ruminants are more susceptible to copper deficiency than humans because rumen sulphide build-up reduces the availability of copper from the feed and increases the risk of conditions such as wobbling in lambs. Molybdenum-rich willows promote the synthesis of thiomolybdate (TM) and the formation of non-resorbable Cu-TM complexes, making the risk a clinical reality (hypocuposis). Selection pressure created ruminant species with deficiency tolerance but susceptibility to copper toxicity in foreign environments, such as B. certain pathogen-free units. In contrast, cases of copper imbalance in humans appeared to be limited to rare genetic abnormalities in copper metabolism. Recent descriptions of the human swayback and the exploratory use of TM to treat Wilson's disease, tumor growth, inflammatory diseases, and Alzheimer's disease have created unexpected similarities. The incidence of prehemolytic copper poisoning in certain pathogen-free lambs was reduced by infection with Mycobacterium avium, making them responsive to treatment with TM but more susceptible to long-term copper deficiency. The copper requirements of ruminants and humans may require an additional allowance for the ""copper cost"" of immunity to infection. Residual inhibition of cuproenzyme in TM-treated lambs and abnormalities in plasma copper composition that appear to depend on liver copper status raise this question: ""Can chelating capacity be utilized without causing copper deficiency in ruminants or humans?"" An equilibrium model between exogenous (TM) and endogenous chelators (e.g. albumin, metallothionein) is used to predict the risk of exposure and hypocurosis; Although the risk of natural human exposure is low, susceptibility to TM-induced copper deficiency can be high. Biomarkers for TM action are needed, and copper chaperones for inhibited cuproenzymes are prime candidates.",,"Suttle, N. F.",2012,2001-09-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.112.002220,0,0,

249,Kayser-Fleischer ring in Wilson's disease: a cohort study,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the characteristics of Wilson's disease (WD) in Sardinian patients with Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring and to assess the correlations between modifications in KF and anti-copper therapy and systemic WD development. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 67 WM patients (35 male/32 female; mean age 41 years) were retrospectively examined. At diagnosis and during follow-up, all patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmological and neurological examinations, brain RMN and ECD-SPECT, detailed objective laboratory examinations, and hepatic histological examinations for analysis. All patients received anti-copper therapy with d-penicillamine monotherapy or in combination with zinc salts. RESULTS: At diagnosis, KF was observed in 27% of patients with an equal distribution in all age groups. Significant correlations between KF at the time of diagnosis, neuropsychiatric manifestations and pathologic features in brain RMN and brain ECD SPECT were found at the time of diagnosis. During follow-up, a decrease or regression in KF was observed in 14% of patients. Anti-copper therapy results in KF regression and prevents KF from occurring. No significant correlations were observed between KF regression and clinical neurological or neuroimaging improvement, or between KF modifications and clinical hepatic improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the distinctive features of Sardinian MV patients: low representation of KF, its even distribution in all age groups, significant correlation between KF at diagnosis and clinical neurological manifestations, pathologic brain RMN and brain ECD-SPECT are supported by our study highlighted. Anti-copper therapy induces KF regression and prevents its onset. Therefore, the KF ring appears to be a predictive factor in the neurological and hepatic development of WD.

250,D-penicillamine targets metastatic melanoma cells with induction of unfolded protein response (UPR) and Noxa (PMAIP1)-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis,"D-penicillamine (3,3-dimethyl-D-cysteine; DP) is an FDA-approved redox-active D-cysteine derivative with antioxidant, disulfide-reducing, and metal-chelating properties used therapeutically to control copper-related pathologies in Wilson's disease and reductive cystine solubilization in cystinuria. Based on the demonstrated sensitivity of metastatic melanoma cells to pharmacological modulation of cellular oxidative stress, we tested the feasibility of using DP for chemotherapeutic interventions targeting A375 human melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. DP treatment induced caspase-dependent cell death in cultured human metastatic melanoma cells (A375, G361) without affecting the viability of primary epidermal melanocytes, an effect associated with the thiol antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and dithiothreitol was not observed. Focused gene expression array analysis followed by immunoblot detection showed that DP rapidly modulates the cytotoxic unfolded protein response (UPR; with Phospho-PERK, Phospho-eIF2alpha, Grp78, CHOP, and Hsp70) and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis with p53 -Upregulation and modulation activates Bcl-2 family members (including Noxa, Mcl-1 and Bcl-2). DP (but not NAC) induced oxidative stress with early impairment of glutathione homeostasis and mitochondrial transmembrane potential. SiRNA-based antagonism of PMAIP1 expression blocked DP-induced upregulation of the BH3-only proapoptotic effector Noxa and prevented downregulation of the Noxa antagonist Mcl-1, thereby rescuing melanoma cells from DP-induced apoptosis. Intraperitoneal administration of DP demonstrated significant anti-timelanoma activity in a murine A375 xenograft model. It remains to be seen whether melanoma cell-directed induction of UPR and apoptosis using DP or enhanced DP derivatives can be exploited for future chemotherapeutic interventions.",,"Qiao, S.;Cabello, C.

The difference in the accumulation of copper in the tissues is responsible for the different clinical manifestations of this disorder. Left untreated, Wilson's disease progresses to liver failure, severe neurological disability, and even death. Due to the complex clinical picture of Wilson's disease, its diagnosis is dependent on a high index of suspicion. In our work, we present endocrine symptoms suggesting the presence of insulinoma and hyperprolactinemia as the initial clinical manifestation of Wilson's disease in a young woman.

Genetic testing revealed the presence of the heterozygous H1069Q mutation. The patient was treated with zinc acetate monotherapy with good response, which was maintained at 22 months. This case underscores the importance of recognizing an atypical clinical presentation of Wilson's disease, which must always be considered in patients with Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. The good clinical response to treatment with zinc acetate monotherapy in our case could lead to considering the use of zinc monotherapy as initial therapy even in symptomatic patients with Wilson's disease under close clinical observation.

254,Discovery of human zinc deficiency: 50 years later,"The essence of zinc for humans and its deficiency was recognized in 1963. In the last 50 years it has become clear that zinc deficiency is widespread in humans. Dietary zinc deficiency can affect nearly 2 billion people in developing countries. Consuming high phytate grain proteins decreases the availability of zinc for absorption. Conditional zinc deficiency is also very common. Growth retardation, male hypogonadism, rough skin, compromised immunity, neurosensory disorders, and cognitive impairment are some of the clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency. Zinc is involved in many biochemical functions. Over 300 enzymes require zinc for their activation and almost 2000 transcription factors require zinc for gene expression. Zinc is essential for cell-mediated immunity. Zinc is also an effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. At therapeutic doses, zinc has been used to treat acute diarrhea in infants and children, the common cold, Wilson's disease, sickle cell anemia, and to prevent blindness in patients with age-related macular degeneration.

256,Wilson's disease: an analysis of 28 Brazilian children,"OBJECTIVES: Clinical-laboratory and evolutionary analysis of twenty-eight patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: Twenty-eight children (twelve females and sixteen males) with Wilson's disease were retrospectively studied between 1987 and 2009, with a follow-up of 72 months (range 1 - 240 months). Clinical, laboratory, and histological features at diagnosis were recorded at the end of the study. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 11 years (range 2-18 years). Twelve patients were asymptomatic, seven had hepatitis symptoms, five had elevated aminotransferase levels, three had hepatomegaly associated with neurological disorders, one had fulminant hepatitis with hemolytic anemia, and six patients presented with a Kayser-Fleischer ring. Histological analysis revealed that six children had chronic hepatitis, seven had cirrhosis, two had steatosis, one had portal fibrosis, and one had massive necrosis. Treatment consisted of D-penicillamine in combination with pyridoxine in 26 patients. Adverse effects were observed in the other two patients: one presented with uncontrollable vomiting and the other presented with elastosis perforans serpiginosa. At the end of the study, all 26 treated patients were asymptomatic. Twenty-four of the patients were treated with D-penicillamine and pyridoxine and two with trientine and zinc sulfate. A liver transplant was performed in one patient with fulminant hepatitis, but the last patient died 48 hours after admission to the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: Family investigations related to early treatment are important to prevent symptoms of Wilson's disease and potentially fatal progression of the disease. The study suggests that Wilson's disease must be ruled out in children over the age of two with abnormal liver enzyme levels due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and the encouraging treatment results obtained to date.",,"Kleine, R.

257,metals and the liver,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Inherited liver diseases that result in copper and iron overload can result in significant morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed and treated early. The purpose of this review is to highlight the most important publications on the genetics, diagnosis, and treatment of hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease over the last 18 months. RECENT FINDINGS: Several advances have recently been made in the genetic diagnosis of hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease. Uncommon HFE mutations that result in phenotypic hemochromatosis in C282Y heterozygotes were identified using HFE gene sequencing. A serum ferritin of less than 1000 µg/l in C282Y homozygotes was associated with milder symptoms of hemochromatosis. Deferasirox has been shown to reduce iron overload in patients with hemochromatosis and may be an option for patients who cannot tolerate phlebotomy. It has been found that there is evidence of a genotype-phenotype correlation in Wilson's disease that can be diagnosed by genetic sequencing. A modified diagnostic guideline was developed for children with Wilson's disease with mild liver disease, increasing the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis. Treatment with copper chelating agents also has fewer hepatic failures compared to zinc monotherapy. SUMMARY: Advances in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment with consequent reductions in morbidity and mortality.",,"Maxwell, K.

258,Penicillamine-treated Wilson's disease and lupus erythematosus: related or distinct entities?,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been reported to be associated with Wilson's disease as a complication of penicillamine treatment. Although drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) shares some features with SLE, they are distinct entities. We report the case of a young girl who was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of five and began therapy with penicillamine. Eight years after beginning therapy, she developed proteinuria that was associated with penicillamine. Two years later, she developed arthritis, malar rash, and laboratory findings consistent with lupus erythematosus. Initially, her symptoms were thought to be related to this treatment because of the known link between penicillamine and DILE. In this hypothesis, she was referred to the Rheumatology Center; Penicillamine was replaced with zinc acetate and she started naproxen to treat arthritis. In any case, the further clinical course and the laboratory findings led to the diagnosis of idiopathic SLE. Renal biopsy revealed massive mesangiocapillary proliferation with subendothelial deposits (wire loops) and glomerular basement membrane duplication (active diffuse global proliferative lupus nephritis, class IV GA). To our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between Wilson's disease and SLE.",,"Dell'era, L.;Boati, E.;Nebbia, G.;Corona, F.",2012,Feb,,0,0,
259,Chelation therapy in Wilson's disease: from D-penicillamine to the design of selective bioinspired intracellular Cu(I) chelators,"Wilson's disease is a rare disease resulting from copper homeostasis dysfunction. Mutations in the ATP7B gene induce impaired function of a Cu-ATPase, impaired Cu detoxification in the liver and copper overload in the body. Although copper is an essential element used as a cofactor by many enzymes that play a vital role, when it is in excess it becomes toxic as it promotes cytotoxic reactions leading to oxidative stress. From this perspective, human copper homeostasis is first described to explain the mechanisms that promote copper overload in Wilson's disease. We will see that the liver is the main organ responsible for distributing and detoxifying copper in the body. Today, this disease is treated for life with systemic chelation therapy, which in many cases is unsatisfactory. Therefore, the design of more selective and efficient drugs is of great interest. A strategy to develop more specific chelating agents to treat localized accumulations of copper in the liver is then presented. In particular, we will show how bioinorganic chemistry can help in the design of such novel chelators, taking inspiration from the biological copper cell transporters.",,"Delangle, P.;Mintz, E.",2012,2007-06-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2dt12188c,0,0,
260,[Diagnosis and Treatment of Wilson's Disease with Neurological Revelation],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to accumulation of copper in many organs, initially in the liver, progressing to cirrhosis, and in the brain, with various neurological symptoms. Diagnosis is based on clinical, biochemical, and genetic tests. Various chelating agent-based treatments can help reduce the spontaneous morbidity and mortality of the disease. We describe three patients with onset of Wilson's disease before age 18 with initial neurological symptoms between 1998 and 2010. After comparison with literature reports, their clinical symptoms, progression, and care allowed us to propose a treatment algorithm. Neurological symptoms such as dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, dysarthria, dysphagia, and psychiatric symptoms are present in 35% of patients with Wilson disease. The time to diagnosis remains too long and may account for the increasing severity of the disease onset and the difficulties in treating these patients. The first choice of treatment must be triethylenetetramine, which causes fewer side effects of an initial worsening of symptoms compared to D-penicillamine. Zinc therapy is the first line of treatment for asymptomatic patients or patients on maintenance therapy. Finally, liver transplantation is a possible treatment even if the patient has severe neurological disability because it can improve clinical symptoms. However, further research on this topic is warranted. Copyright A© 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",,"Wagner, S.;Brunet, A.

261,"Serum ""free"" copper in Wilson's disease","BACKGROUND: The relationship between ""free"" serum copper and urinary copper in patients with Wilson's disease has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine if there is a direct relationship between these two parameters. METHOD: The case notes of 320 patients with Wilson's disease seen between 1960 and 1987 were reviewed. Eighty of these patients were treatment-naïve prior to referral, and “free” serum copper and urinary copper results at admission and after one year of treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: Except in patients with acute hemolysis, the ratio of ""free"" serum copper to urine copper before treatment averages about 7:1, after treatment it falls to about 5:1. But the results show a large spread and there is no direct linear relationship. CONCLUSION: The term ""free"" copper is misleading and should be replaced by the more cumbersome but more accurate term ""copper not bound to ceruloplasmin"". Most ""free"" copper is complexed with albumin and is only available for excretion when there is significant protein loss through the kidneys.",,"Walshe, J.

262,Excretion of metal elements in the 24-hour urine in patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to copper accumulation and resulting toxicity. D-penicillamine, a powerful metal chelator, is an important therapy for Wilson's disease. To study the changes of metal elements under treatment with D-penicillamine, we determined the concentrations of Cu, Zn, Mg, Ca, Fe, Se, Mn, Pb, Hg, Cd, As, Tl and Al by ICP-MS im 24-hour urine from 115 patients with Wilson's disease who had received maintenance doses of D:-penicillamine for 1 month to 22 years and from 115 healthy age-matched controls. The concentrations of Cu, Mg, Ca, Zn, Hg, Pb, Tl, Cd, and Mn in the 24-hour urine of the cases were significantly higher than those of the controls (P < 0.05), and the increases in the concentrations observed of Mg, Ca and Zn correlated directly with treatment duration with a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.356 (Mg), 0.329 (Ca) and 0.313 (Zn) respectively (P<0.05). On the other hand, 24-hour urine Al and As levels were lower than controls (P<0.05) and negatively correlated with treatment time, with R of -0.337 (Al) and -0.398 (As) and (P < 0.05). Thus, this study indicates that concentrations of metal elements may be altered in patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine.",,"Huang, L.;Yu, X.;Zhang, J.;Liu, X.;Zhang, Y.;Jiao, X.;Yu, X.",2012,May,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-011-9250-3,0,0,
263,"Inherited copper transport disorders: biochemical mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment","Copper is an essential trace element required by all living organisms. However, excess amounts of copper lead to cell damage. Disorders of normal copper homeostasis are hallmarks of three genetic disorders: Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome, and Wilson's disease. Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome are characterized by copper deficiency. Typical features of Menkes disease result from low copper-dependent enzyme activity. Standard treatment involves parenteral administration of copper histidine. If treatment is started before 2 months of age, neurodegeneration can be prevented, while delayed treatment is completely ineffective. Therefore, neonatal mass screening should be performed. Connective tissue diseases, on the other hand, cannot be improved by copper-histidine treatment. Combination therapy with copper histidine injections and oral administration of disulfiram is being studied. Occipital horn syndrome, characterized by connective tissue abnormalities, is the mildest form of Menkes disease. No treatment for this syndrome has been carried out. Wilson's disease is characterized by copper toxicity, typically severely affecting the liver and nervous system. Various other symptoms are also observed, but their early diagnosis is sometimes difficult. Chelation and zinc are effective treatments but ineffective in most patients with fulminant liver failure. In addition, some patients with neurological Wilson disease deteriorate or respond poorly to chelating agents. Since early treatment is crucial, a screening system for Wilson's disease should be implemented in infants. Patients with Wilson's disease may be at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Understanding the link between Wilson's disease and hepatocellular carcinoma will be beneficial for the treatment and prevention of disease.",,"Kodama, H.;Fujisawa, C.;Bhadhprasit, W.",2012,Mar,,0,0,
264,Manifestations and development of Wilson's disease in pediatric patients with ATP7B mutation L708P,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to characterize a cohort of 11 pediatric patients aged 3 to 13 years affected by Wilson's disease (WD) on the island of Gran Canaria, Spain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genetic, biochemical and pathological characteristics were analyzed along with their treatment response and clinical progression for this patient population. RESULTS: Genetically, the group was fairly homogeneous, with an extremely high prevalence of the L708P mutation (4 homozygotes and 5 heterozygotes). Although initially screened for asymptomatic hypertransaminemia, all patients presented some degree of liver damage that was never accompanied by any neurological manifestation. Liver damage was most severe in a compound heterozygote with a novel mutation, G1266W, affecting a motif in the ATP7B polypeptide that is highly conserved in similar proteins in metazoans. Ceruloplasmin and serum copper levels, together with determination of hepatic copper content, proved to be of great diagnostic value, while urinary copper measurements proved to be much less meaningful. All patients responded well to treatment with D-penicillamine with no documented side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The patients in Gran Canaria represent overall one of the largest groups of patients with WD with a high incidence of a single mutation, which allows us to assess the early clinical signs and evolution of the disease in patients with the ATP7B-L708P mutant define alleles and the study of WD in a genetically homogeneous background.",,"Pena-Quintana, L.;Garcia-Luzardo, M.

266,Neurological Wilson's disease in children: a three-year experience by Multan,"AIM: To describe the neurological manifestations, examination results, and treatment response of Wilson's disease in children from Multan. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from June 2005 to May 2008 at the Department of Neurology, Children's Hospital and Institute of Children's Health, Multan. Fifty children were included in this study. Age at onset of symptoms, gender, duration of symptoms, presence of symptoms, parental consanguinity, family history, and response to treatment were noted. The chi-square test was used to measure the relationship between variables and treatment response. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Of the 50 cases examined, 48 were index cases and two were diagnosed at screening. The male-female ratio was 2.1:1. The mean age at onset of symptoms was 9.06 +/- 2.65 years. Dystonia, dysarthria and cognitive decline were observed in 92%, drooling in 68%, tremors in 52%, chorea in 24% and seizures in 12% of the children. Kayser-Fleischer rings and elevated 24-hour urinary copper levels after penicillamine challenge, 1567 +/- 167.35 micrograms/day were present in all 50 children. Twenty-two (44%) children had early responses, 24 (48%) late responses, and 4 (8%) children had no responses after one year of treatment. Late, older than 10 years of onset of symptoms, less than 6 months duration of symptoms, and urinary copper excretion of less than 1000 micrograms/day were found to be statistically significant factors for early response to treatment. CONCLUSION: In the study population, dystonia, dysarthria and cognitive decline were the most common manifestations. 24-hour urinary copper was found to be helpful for diagnosis.

The clinical presentation is variable, with full-blown disease manifesting cirrhosis, neurologic damage, and a Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring on the cornea. A 24-year-old man developed right upper quadrant pain with a palpable mass and swelling of the right talocrural joint. X-rays were uneventful, but routine liver enzyme testing revealed a 6- to 8-fold increase in SGPT, SGOT, and AST. Antibodies to hepatitis B, C were normal, as were ANA, ANCA, antimytochondrial, and antismooth muscle antibodies. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed extremely dilated liver and cyst ducts and gallbladder. A large, edematous gallbladder containing yellow-green bile was removed, the liver was found to be cirrhotic, but since the surgical bleeding was profuse, a biopsy was omitted. Serum ceruloplasmin low [0.160 g/l (normal 0.204-0.407)], serum copper 12.7 micromol/l (11.0-24.4), transaminase: always very high, normal/slightly increased in recent months. Copper in urine: 1.0 micromol/24 h (>9.44). As can be seen at first glance, the subject had tremor, dysarthria, dystonia and a KF ring on the cornea. After 10 months of treatment with penicillamine, his transaminases returned to normal, tremor, dysarthria, dystonia first got worse and then improved. Clotting times are improved but not yet normalized. Mutation analysis has shown that the subject is homozygous for c.3207 C->A, p.H1069Q while his parents are heterozygous.

269,A Clinical Study of Wilson's Disease: The Experience of a Single Egyptian Department of Pediatric Hepatology,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Most pediatric patients with Wilson's disease (WD) have hepatic manifestations, but some may present with neurological or psychiatric features. Our aim was to define the clinical, biochemical features and therapeutic outcome of a group of Egyptian children diagnosed with WM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted at the Department of Pediatric Hepatology, Children's Hospital, Cairo University, Egypt; 54 patients were diagnosed with WD between 1996 and 2009. Diagnosis was based on low serum ceruloplasmin levels, elevated urinary copper concentrations before or after D-penicillamine challenge, and/or the presence of Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings. RESULTS: The clinical presentation was as follows: hepatic presentation in 33 patients (61%), hepato-neurological 3 (5.5%), neurological 5 (9.3%) and presymptomatic 13 (24%). Twelve couples had more than one affected sibling. Elevated urinary copper concentrations before or after D-penicillamine challenge were found in all patients, low serum ceruloplasmin in 97% and KF rings in 31.5%. All patients were treated with penicillamine and zinc sulfate, except for one pre-symptomatic case, who was treated with zinc sulfate alone. Three patients underwent liver transplantation and eight patients died after a median treatment duration of 6 months (1-36). The hepatic symptoms improved with treatment, but the neurological symptoms remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and biochemical assays remain the standard for the diagnosis of WD. Penicillamine and zinc therapy can effectively treat WM with hepatic symptoms. Liver transplantation remains life-saving for those with fulminant and end-stage WD. Screening for pre-symptomatic siblings is of paramount importance. Copyright A© 2011 Arab Journal of Gastroenterology. Issued by Elsevier Ltd.

271,case of isolated elevated copper levels during pregnancy,"INTRODUCTION: Outside of Wilson's disease, abnormal copper metabolism is a rare condition. During pregnancy, excess copper levels can be associated with intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia, and neurological disorders. CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old gravida 4 para 2012 with an obstetric history complicated by elevated copper levels presented for routine prenatal care. Her children had elevated copper levels at birth, their firstborn was diagnosed with autism, suffered three myocardial infarctions, and was treated for elevated copper levels. During her earlier pregnancies, she refused treatment for her elevated copper levels. During that pregnancy, she had declined chelation therapy, opting for zinc therapy instead. She gave birth to a healthy child with normal copper levels. CONCLUSION: Changes in the copper metabolism are rare, the consequences during pregnancy can be devastating. While isolated elevation of copper in pregnancy is extremely rare, it is treated in the same way as Wilson's disease. The aim is to prevent growth-inhibiting and neurological consequences in the newborn and pre-eclampsia in the mother. Counseling, along with treatment options and timely delivery, can greatly improve newborn and maternal outcomes.",,"Walker, L.

272,Excess copper chelation therapy in Wilson's disease induces anemia and liver dysfunction,"37-year-old man was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of 14. Its first manifestations were neurological in nature. He had been treated with trientine for more than 10 years and suffered from anemia and liver dysfunction. Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder characterized by accumulation of copper in the body. Excess copper is toxic, but copper is an essential trace element. Copper-binding ceruloplasmin is important for iron metabolism. Excessive copper chelation has been suggested to cause anemia and liver iron deposition. Proper monitoring of copper status is important in the management of Wilson's disease.",,"Harada, M.;Miyagawa, K.;Honma, Y.;Hiura, M.;Shibata, M.;Matsuhashi, T.;Abe, S.;Harada, R.;Tabaru, A.",2011,,,0,0,

274,Phenotypic and genetic characterization of a cohort of pediatric patients with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: In Egypt, Wilson's disease appears to be underdiagnosed and clinical data across large cohorts are limited. The aim of this study is to highlight the clinical, laboratory and genetic features of this disease in our pediatric population and to report our experience with treatment options and outcomes. METHODS: The study included 77 patients from 50 unrelated families (62 were followed for a median of 58.9 +/- 6.4 months and 27 were asymptomatic siblings). Data were collected retrospectively through file analysis and patient interviews. The diagnosis was confirmed by sequencing the ATP7B gene in 64 patients. RESULTS: Our patients had unique characteristics compared to other populations. They had a younger age at diagnosis (median: 10 years), a higher prevalence of Kayser-Fleischer rings (97.6% in the symptomatic patients), low ceruloplasmin (93.5%), a high rate of parental consanguinity (78, 9%) and a severe course. 71.42% of patients who received D-penicillamine for a longer period improved or remained stable during follow-up, with only 11.5% experiencing severe side effects. Prophylactic treatment with zinc monotherapy was an effective, non-toxic alternative to D-penicillamine. Homozygous mutations were found in 85.7%, however, finding genotype-phenotype correlations was difficult due to the large number of mutations detected. Missense mutations were most common, while protein-shortening mutations led to a more severe course with a higher incidence of acute liver failure and neurological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Egyptian children with Wilson's disease have early Kayser-Fleischer rings and early onset of liver and neurological disease. The identified mutation spectrum differs from that observed in other countries. The high rate of homozygous mutations (reflecting the high rate of consanguinity) may provide further insight into the correlation between genotype and phenotype.",,"Abdel Ghaffar, T. Y.;Elsayed, S.

275,Prognostic significance of neurological examination findings in Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Patients with Wilson's disease exhibit one of several neurological phenotypes and their treatment outcomes vary widely. Our aim was to determine whether the present clinical features of neurological Wilson disease (WD) predict long-term neurological outcomes in patients receiving anticopper treatment. METHODS: Patients enrolled in four WD treatment studies received a standardized neurological assessment at study entry and then at pre-specified intervals after anticopper therapy, first with tetrathiomolybdate or trientine and then with zinc. The study assessed the patients' motor signs, including tremor, stiffness, dystonia, dyarthria, and gait. The total score was obtained by summing these sub-scores. 86 patients were included in our analysis, with a mean follow-up of 34.7 months. Retrospectively, the analysis compared scaled and unscaled sign subscores at registration and follow-up to changes in total score using a generalized estimating equation approach. RESULTS: In the primary analysis, improvement in total score was best represented by signed subscores for tremor (beta -0.7, p=0.006), gait abnormalities (beta -3.7, p<0.001), and speech (beta = -1). .3, p=0.05). Dystonia (beta = 1.8, p < 0.001) and facial expression (beta = 1.9, p = 0.03) were associated with worsening of the total score. Of the individually monitored motor signs, dystonia proved to be the most resistant to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large-scale, prospectively acquired study evaluating the prognostic importance of specific neurological signs in WM. Our data support the historical observations that tremor is a favorable prognostic sign, while dystonia in WM is relatively resistant to therapy. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

276,The pattern of urinary copper excretion and its response to treatment in patients with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: It is well established that patients with Wilson's disease excrete excess copper in their urine. However, there is no study on a large number of patients whether there are differences in the rate of excretion at different stages of the disease or what changes can be expected after treatment. DESIGN: The present study is based on an analysis of the results of urinary copper excretion of 192 patients with Wilson's disease observed between 1955 and 2000. These patients were divided into three groups, pre-symptomatic, hepatic and neurological Wilson's disease. Patients were assessed for basal pretreatment, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and for 6 hours after a test dose of 500 mg penicillamine. The tests were repeated after about 1 and 2 years of chelation therapy with either penicillamine or, in a small minority of cases, trientine. RESULTS: Pretreatment basal copper excretion was lowest in presymptomatic patients (207.93 micrograms/24 hours) and highest in hepatic patients (465.75 micrograms/24 hours). Those with neurological Wilson disease reported an intermediate number (305.58 micrograms/24 h). The response to penicillamine was highest in the neurological patients and lowest in the pre-symptomatic group. After 1 and 2 years of treatment, all groups showed a significant decrease in both basal and post-penicillamine excretion rates of copper. The small subgroup treated with trientine instead of penicillamine showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of copper excretion in patients with Wilson's disease varies widely between patients, but in general, patients with pre-symptomatic disease excrete less copper than patients with symptomatic disease. All groups show a large increase when challenged with penicillamine. After 1 and 2 years of treatment, there is a significant decrease in copper excretion both with basal therapy and after penicillamine provocation. This presumably indicates a reduction in body exposure to copper.",,"Walshe, J. M.",2011,Sep,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcr073,0,0,

278,Alterations in lipid metabolism in Wilson's disease,"INTRODUCTION: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of human copper metabolism characterized by accumulation of copper predominantly in the liver and brain, resulting in severe hepatic and neurological disorders. Interesting results in animal models of WD (Atp7b-/- and LEC rats) showed an altered lipid metabolism with a decrease in the amount of triglycerides and cholesterol in the serum. However, the serum lipid profile has not been studied in large human cohorts of WM patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cohort study involved 251 patients who were examined at the university hospitals of Heidelberg and Dresden (Germany). Patients were analyzed for serum lipid profile, including triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) at routine follow-up visits. Data on these parameters at the time of diagnosis were obtained by chart review where available. For statistical testing, patients were subgrouped by gender, manifestation (hepatic, neurologic, mixed, and asymptomatic), and treatment (D-penicillamine, trientine, zinc, or combination). RESULTS: A significant difference in total serum cholesterol was found in patients with hepatic symptoms that decreased on therapy. No changes were observed for HDL, LDL and triglycerides. CONCLUSION: In contrast to previous reports using WD animal models (Atp7b-/- and LEC rats), the most obvious change in our cohort was a lower serum cholesterol level in liver-affected patients, which could be related to liver damage. Our data indicate undisturbed cholesterol metabolism in Wilson's disease on therapy, regardless of the medical treatment used.",,"Seessle, J.;Gohdes, A.;Gotthardt, D.

279,Wilson's disease in southern Brazil: a 40-year follow-up study,"BACKGROUND: Long-term data on clinical follow-up and treatment effectiveness of Wilson's disease are limited due to the low incidence of the disease. This study evaluated a retrospective cohort of patients with Wilson's disease from southern Brazil during a 40-year follow-up period. METHODS: Thirty-six Wilson's disease patients diagnosed between 1971 and 2010 were retrospectively evaluated for their clinical presentation, epidemiological and social characteristics, response to therapy, and outcome. RESULTS: Examination of the patients' continental origins showed that 74.5% had a European ancestry. The mean age at first symptom presentation was 23.3 +/- 9.3 years, with a delay of 27.5 +/- 41.9 months to the final diagnosis. At presentation, hepatic symptoms were predominant (38.9%), followed by mixed symptoms (hepatic and neuropsychiatric) (30.6%) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (25%). Kayser-Fleischer rings were identified in 55.6% of patients, with a higher frequency in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms (77.8%). Eighteen patients developed neuropsychiatric features, most commonly cerebellar syndrome. Neuroradiological imaging abnormalities were observed in 72.2% of these patients. Chronic liver disease was identified in 68% of patients with hepatic symptoms. 94.2% of all patients were treated with D-penicillamine for an average period of 129.9 +/- 108.3 months. Other treatments included zinc salts, combination therapy, and liver transplantation. After starting therapy, 78.8% of patients had a stable or improved outcome and the overall survival rate was 90.1%. CONCLUSION: This study is the first retrospective description of a population of Wilson's disease patients of mainly continental European descent living in southern Brazil. Wilson's disease is treatable when properly diagnosed and an adequate quality of life can be achieved, resulting in a long overall survival.",,"Bem, R. S.;Muzzillo, D. A.;Deguti, M. M.;Barbosa, E.

280,D-penicillamine elastosis perforans serpiginosa: description of two cases and review of the literature,"Long-term therapy with D-penicillamine (DPA) for the treatment of Wilson's disease can induce serpiginous elastosis perforans (EPS), a very rare degenerative skin disease characterized by transepidermal elimination of elastic fiber aggregates. The iatrogenic disease depends on the ability of DPA to chelate copper and cause its degradation. Lysyl oxidase is a copper-dependent enzyme critical for cross-linking of dermal elastic fibers, which is strongly affected by DPA copper depletion. The direct binding of the drug to collagen precursors also affects the assembly and maturation of elastic fibers. The abnormal elastin accumulates in the middle dermis, producing a characteristic bramble-tufted or ""lumpy-bumpy"" appearance. In this way, it acts like a foreign body and is gradually extruded through the epidermis. Clinically, the disease presents with multiple firm keratotic papules and nodules arranged in annular plaques over the neck, axillae, antecubital fossae, and forearms. The rarity of the disease often leads to misdiagnosis and the process continues unabated, raising concerns about systemic elastopathy.",,"Atzori, L.;Pinna, A.

284,Risks and benefits of copper in light of new insights into copper homeostasis,"Copper is an essential micronutrient involved in a variety of biological processes essential to sustaining life. At the same time, it can be toxic in excessive presence, the most notable chronic effect being liver damage. Potent, efficient regulatory mechanisms control copper uptake in the digestive tract and biliary excretion of copper; Absorption in humans ranges from 12 to 60%, depending on Cu intake, the presence of other factors in the diet that may enhance or inhibit absorption, and the individual's copper status. Current evidence suggests that copper deficiency is more common than previously thought, while copper toxicity is uncommon under normal everyday conditions. Menkes syndrome and Wilson disease are genetic disorders associated with severe copper deficiency and severe copper toxicity, respectively. The effects of mild copper deficiency and copper overexposure are not well characterized, mainly due to the lack of sensitive and specific indicators; Serum copper concentration and ceruloplasmin are the most commonly used indicators, but they capture only fairly large changes in copper status. Of the many proteins that have been evaluated as potential markers for copper status, the Zn-Cu superoxide dismutase (CCS1) chaperone has shown promising results; Data on its performance under different conditions are needed to confirm its use as an indicator of early copper deficiency. Defining copper requirements and upper safe consumption limits (UL) is a complex process, as both copper deficiency and copper excess (U-shaped curve) have adverse health consequences. The regulatory framework for risk assessment of essential trace elements introduced by the International Program on Chemical Safety (IPCS) has proposed a homeostatic model to determine the appropriate oral intake range (AROI) of essential trace elements; the nadir of the resulting U-shaped curve is used to define the AROI. At this range of intake, physiological mechanisms allow for normal homeostasis and there are essentially no detectable side effects. Currently, Recommended Intakes (DRIs) and Adequate Intakes (AIs) are used to recommend copper intakes in different age and life situations. The evidence presented here from humans and non-human primates suggests that the current copper UL value should be reassessed. Developing the scientific basis for a copper UL and assessing the relevance of copper shortages worldwide are key future challenges for copper researchers. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified a patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome who also developed cholestasis and histopathologic features consistent with biliary atresia, suggesting that mutations involving zfhz1b contribute to biliary tract developmental abnormalities or a injury to the bile ducts. We used the zebrafish model system to determine whether zfhx1b plays a role in vertebrate gall development. RESULTS: Using zebrafish, we found that zfhx1b was expressed in the developing liver during bile growth and remodeling and that morpholino antisense oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of zfhx1b resulted in defects in bile development. These findings were associated with decreased expression of vhnf1, a transcription factor known to be important in bile development in zebrafish and mammals.

287,Hepatocyte targeting and intracellular copper chelation by a thiol-containing glycocyclopeptide,"Metal overload plays an important role in several diseases or intoxications, such as Wilson's disease, a major genetic disorder of copper metabolism in humans. In order to efficiently and selectively lower the copper concentration in the severely damaged liver, chelating agents should be targeted to the hepatocytes. In the present work, we have synthesized a molecule capable of both lowering intracellular copper, namely Cu(I), and targeting hepatocytes by combining a chelating moiety and a carbohydrate recognition element within the same structure. A cyclodecapeptide scaffold was chosen to introduce both units, which has a controlled conformation with two independent faces. One side shows a set of carbohydrates to ensure efficient recognition of the asialoglycoprotein receptors expressed on the surface of hepatocytes. The second page is dedicated to metal ion complexation thanks to the thiolate functions of two cysteine side chains. In order to obtain a chelator that is only active once in the cell, the two thiol functions were oxidized in a disulfide bridge to the glycopeptide P(3). Two simple cyclodecapeptides that model the reduced and complexing form of P(3) in cells showed high affinity for Cu(I) and high selectivity towards Zn(II). As expected, P(3) becomes an efficient Cu(I) chelator in the presence of glutathione, which mimics the intracellular reducing environment. Finally, cellular uptake and the ability to lower intracellular copper have been demonstrated in hepatic cell lines, particularly WIF-B9, making P(3) a good candidate to combat copper overload in the liver.",,"Pujol, A.

The proportions of metolose and bicarbonate were varied and the effects of the different ratios on the properties of the resulting powders and tablets were determined. First, the water absorption of different powder mixtures was evaluated. These tests showed the interaction of the active ingredient and the effervescent, this phenomenon leading to an unforeseen increase in the amount of liquid ingested. This interaction was evaluated in terms of degradation of the hydrophilic matrix system. The disintegration of tablets with different compositions showed that this interaction prolongs the time required for these systems to disintegrate. The study showed that the interaction of the components produced significant changes in the parameters of this new sensitive delivery system. In the final steps, the buoyancy and dissolution properties of tablets considered suitable for formulating a controlled drug delivery system were investigated.

With treatment, outcome can be excellent, although long-term survival is not yet well documented. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term outcome of a cohort of patients with WM and to assess the factors affecting the phenotypic manifestation of WM. METHODS: The presence of ATP7B gene mutations, clinical manifestations, treatments and long-term outcomes were retrospectively analyzed in 117 patients with MV (59 males and 58 females, age at assessment 38.5 +/- 11, range 16- 63). Years). RESULTS: Fifty-five patients with neurological presentation, 51 patients with hepatic presentation, and 11 asymptomatic patients were followed for a mean of 15.1 +/- 10 years (median 12 years, range 1-41 years). The H1069Q ATP7B gene mutation was the most common genetic variant (54.3%); the frequency of this mutation did not differ between patients with hepatic or neurological presentation (p=0.099). d-penicillamine or zinc salts (81 and 17%, respectively) were used for treatment and three patients underwent liver transplantation. The majority of symptomatic patients became asymptomatic or improved during follow-up (82% patients with hepatic presentation, 69% with neurological presentation). The long-term survival of patients with WD did not differ from that of the general Czech population (p = 0.95).

291,Exceptional stability of copper(I) tetrathiomolybdate complexes: possible implications for aquatic ecosystems,"An exceptional affinity of MoS42- for Cu explains the Mo-induced Cu deficiency in ruminants (molybdenosis) and offers an approach to treat Wilson's disease in humans. The detection of thiomolybdates in sulfidic natural waters, and possibly even as metastable traces in oxic natural waters, raises the question of how Cu-Mo affinity might affect Cu availability or toxicity in aquatic ecosystems. Stabilities of inorganic Cu-MoS42 complexes are characterized and quantified here for the first time. Two remarkably stable dissolved Cu(I) complexes are identified (T = 23 °C +/- 2 °C): Cu2(HS)2MoS42- and Cu2S2MoS44-. In addition, the solubility constant for a precipitate (NH4CuMoS4) was measured. Under the extremely reducing conditions in rumen fluids, these complexes will strongly quench Cu(+) activity, supporting previous conclusions about the mechanism of molybdenosis. In sulphide-bearing natural waters, they help prevent complete Cu depletion which might otherwise occur from sulphide mineral precipitation. On the other hand, the complexes discovered here are HS--dependent and might not be relevant in oxic natural waters (with HS concentrations < 10-9 M) even if metastable, biogenic MoS42- were actually present, as previously suggested.

293,"Effects of long-term zinc treatment in Japanese patients with Wilson's disease: efficacy, stability, and copper metabolism","Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder with copper metabolism. In Japan, the standard of care is the administration of copper chelators such as D-penicillamine and trientine. In this study, the authors used zinc acetate to treat Japanese patients with Wilson's disease and examined its effectiveness. The 37 patients in this study were determined to have Wilson's disease by clinical and biochemical tests and were given zinc acetate for 48 weeks. The authors followed the patients' clinical symptoms and laboratory findings by evaluating their complete blood count, biochemical findings, urinalysis results and specific laboratory tests for copper and zinc metabolism. We also looked at side effects of the treatment. Zinc acetate did not aggravate hepatic or neurological symptoms in any patient. Biochemical blood analysis also showed no increase in levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. Zinc treatment did not aggravate the patients' clinical symptoms and/or laboratory findings. However, it improved some clinical symptoms of Wilson's disease patients. Although this remedy had some side effects, none of them were serious. The authors measured the punctiform excretion of copper in the urine, which gave an indication of the effectiveness of the treatment and the adequate dosage of zinc.

295,Reassessment of diagnostic criteria for Wilson disease in children with mild liver disease,"WITHOUT LABELING: Diagnosing Wilson disease (WD) is challenging, particularly in children. Early detection is desirable to avoid a dramatic course of the disease. The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the conventional diagnostic criteria and the MV scoring system proposed by an international consensus in 2001 in MV children with mild liver disease. Forty children with WM (26 boys and 14 girls, age range = 1.1-20.9 years) and 58 age- and sex-matched patients with liver disease other than WM were evaluated. Both groups were asymptomatic and had elevated aminotransferases as the predominant sign of liver disease. In all WM patients, the diagnosis was supported by molecular analyses, liver copper content, or both. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of ceruloplasmin at the cutoff level of 20 mg/dL showed a sensitivity of 95% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 83% - 99.4%] and a specificity of 84.5% (95% CI = 72.6% - 92.6%). The optimal diagnostic cutoff for basal urinary copper was 40 µg/24 hours (Sensitivity = 78.9%, 95% CI = 62.7% - 90.4%; Specificity = 87.9%, 95% -CI = 76.7% - 95%). Urinary copper levels after penicillamine challenge did not differ significantly between WM patients and controls, and the ROC analysis showed a sensitivity of only 12%. The WD scoring system has been proven to have positive and negative predictive values of 93% and 91.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A urinary copper excretion of more than 40 cups/24 hours suggests WD in asymptomatic children, whereas the penicillamine challenge test has no diagnostic role in this subset of patients. The WD scoring system provides good diagnostic accuracy.

296,Wilson disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that results in liver damage and neurological disorders of varying degrees. The defective ATP7B gene encodes a hepatic copper-transporting protein that plays a key role in human copper metabolism. Our knowledge of the genetic basis of Wilson's disease has increased dramatically; However, the understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation and the diverse effects of copper toxicity as a basis for targeted and individualized therapy strategies is still insufficient. Clinical manifestations are related to copper accumulation predominantly in the liver and brain and include liver disease ranging from mild hepatitis to acute liver failure or cirrhosis and/or neurological symptoms such as dystonia, tremor, dysarthria, psychiatric disorders. Mixed presentations are common. Early detection through clinical, biochemical, or genetic testing and initiation of therapy with copper chelators, zinc salts, or even liver transplantation in acute and chronic liver failure are essential for a favorable outcome.

299,Synthesis and biological characterization of novel low-charge spermine analogues,"Biogenic polyamines, spermidine and spermine, are positively charged at physiological pH. They are present in all cells and are essential for their growth and viability. Here we synthesized three new isosteric charge-deficiency derivatives of the spermine analogue 1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadodecane (SpmTriene, 5a), namely N(1)-Ac-SpmTriene (5c), N(12)- Ac-SpmTriene (5b) and N(1),N(12)-diethyl-1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadodecane (N(1),N(12)-Et(2)-SpmTriene, 5d). 5a and 5d readily accumulated in DU145 cells in the same concentration range as natural polyamines and competed moderately for uptake with putrescine (1) but not with spermine (4a) or spermidine (2). 5a efficiently downregulated ornithine decarboxylase and reduced polyamine levels, while 5d proved to be inefficient compared to N(1),N(11)-diethylnorspermine (6). None of the analogs tested were substrates for human recombinant spermine oxidase, but those with a free amino terminus, including 1,8-diamino-3,6-diazaoctane (triene, 3a), were acetylated by recombinant mouse spermidine/spermine N(1)- . acetyltransferase. 5a was acetylated to 5c and 5b, and the latter was further metabolized by acetylpolyamine oxidase to 3a, a drug used to treat Wilson's disease. Thus, 5a is a bioactive precursor to 3a with increased bioavailability.",,"Weisell, J.;Hyvonen, M. T.;Hakkinen, M. R.;Grigorenko, N. A.;Pietila, M.;Lampinen, A.;Kochetkov, S.

300,Triethylenetetramine pharmacology and its clinical applications,"Triethylenetetramine (TETA), a Cu(II)-selective chelating agent, is commonly used to treat Wilson's disease. Recently, TETA has been shown to be useful in the treatment of cancer because of its telomerase-inhibiting and anti-angiogenesis properties. Although TETA has been used to treat Wilson's disease for decades, there is no comprehensive review of TETA pharmacology. TETA is poorly absorbed with a bioavailability of 8-30%. It is widely distributed in tissues, with relatively high concentrations measured in the liver, heart and kidneys. It is primarily metabolised by acetylation and two major acetylated metabolites exist in human serum and urine. It is mainly excreted in the urine as unchanged parent compound and two acetylated metabolites. In humans, it has a relatively short half-life (2 to 4 hours). The latest discoveries in TETA pharmacology indicate that the key pharmacokinetic parameters are not related to the acetylation phenotype of N-acetyltransferase 2, the enzyme traditionally considered to be the drug acetylating enzyme, and that the TETA-metabolizing enzyme is in fact spermidine/spermine -acetyltransferase is. This overview also includes the current pre-clinical and clinical use of TETA. A much-needed overview and up-to-date information on TETA pharmacology is provided to any clinician or cancer researcher intending to conduct clinical cancer trials of TETA or its similar structural analogues.",,"Lu, J.",2010,Sep,https://dx.doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0523,0,0,
301,Persistence of treatment in patients with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wilson's disease is a genetic failure of copper metabolism. Left untreated, it can lead to death within a few years of symptoms appearing. Drug use should therefore be continued throughout the patient's life after diagnosis. Clinical observations show that patients with Wilson's disease frequently discontinue treatment. The aim of our study was to assess how drug compliance (defined as persistence in drug use) affects the overall well-being of patients with Wilson's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease and observed in our outpatient departments were asked to complete the self-completed questionnaire. The questions related to demographics, disease characteristics, treatment methods and duration of treatment, subjective assessment of health status, and treatment effectiveness. In addition, the EQ-5D questionnaire with a visual analogue scale of well-being was used. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 120 subjects, but only 104 questionnaires could be further processed. Our analysis revealed no differences in the persistence of D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate use or the effectiveness of the prescribed medications. However, we found that regardless of the medication used, persistence with treatment resulted in significantly better self-assessment scores (overall improvement in 39.7% vs. 7.7% in the non-persistent group, p=0.003; partial improvement in 53.8% vs. 30.8%, p=0.045, and deterioration: none in the persistent group vs. 42.3% in the non-persistent group, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A lack of persistence in taking prescribed medications is fairly common in patients with Wilson's disease. Poor compliance reduces the chances of improvement and can be the cause of clinical deterioration.",,"Maselbas, W.;Chabik, G.;Czlonkowska, A.",2010,May-Jun,,0,0,

Some cases also present with epilepsy, growth retardation with microcephaly, and speech disorders. MWS was first described in 1998 by Mowat et al. described, and by August 2008 about 180 cases had been reported.

Most cases reported so far have been sporadic occurrences; However, rare cases of sibling recurrence have been reported. The facial phenotype is particularly important for initial clinical diagnosis and provides the hallmark that warrants ZEB2 mutational analysis even in the absence of Hirschsprung disease.

306,Effect of glutathione degradation on the removal of copper from LEC rat livers by tetrathiomolybdate,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a potent and selective copper (Cu) chelator used as a therapeutic for Wilson's disease. TTM is the only agent capable of removing metallothionein (MT)-bound Cu in the livers of cinnamon-colored Long Evans (LEC) rats. However, administration of excess TTM causes Cu and molybdenum (Mo) deposition in the liver. In the present study, the effect of hepatic glutathione (GSH) deficiency on the removal of Cu from the liver of LEC rats was evaluated to establish an effective therapy by TTM. Pretreatment with L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a GSH depletor in vivo, reduced the amounts of Cu and Mo excreted in both the bile and the bloodstream and increased the Cu and Mo deposited in the liver of LEC rats -Quantities form an insoluble complex 4 h after TTM injection. The results suggest that GSH depletion creates an oxidative environment in the livers of LEC rats and the oxidative environment facilitates the insolubilization of Cu and Mo in the livers of LEC rats after TTM injection. Therefore, the effect of TTM on the removal of Cu from the liver in the oxidized state was reduced. Wilson's disease patients and LEC rats develop liver damage caused by oxidative injury. From a clinical point of view, an increase in GSH concentration is expected to enhance the effect of TTM. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

308,Clinical features and therapeutic response in Taiwanese children with Wilson's disease: 12 years of experience at a single center,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive defect in cellular copper export. Early diagnosis in children is difficult because of the unclear clinical presentation. The effectiveness of zinc salts is well documented, although there is limited data on the use of zinc in pediatric patients with WM. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical features, laboratory findings, and treatment responses in children with WD diagnosed at Taichung Veterans General Hospital between 1996 and 2008. Diagnosis was made by low serum ceruloplasmin, high 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and mutational analysis. RESULTS: Eleven children were included in this study. The main presentations were impaired liver function tests (6/11) and hemolytic anemia (2/11). Genetic studies in seven children revealed six different mutations (G934D, R778Q, C490X, 304insC, IVS4-1 G > C, P992I) and one possible new mutation (L1181P). All patients had improved liver function tests and hemoglobin levels after treatment with D-penicillamine, trientine, and zinc supplement therapy. During a median of 3.4 +/- 2.1 years of zinc therapy, six patients had serum zinc levels above the normal limit and seven patients had serum copper levels below the normal range. CONCLUSION: Serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urine copper studies could be used to rule out WD in children with chronic hepatitis and hemolytic anemia. Gene analysis is helpful for rapid diagnosis of asymptomatic siblings and patients with atypical traits. Zinc treatment is generally safe in pediatric patients with WM. However, side effects should be monitored. Copyright 2010 Taiwan Pediatric Association. Published by Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Wang, L. C.;Wang, J. D.;Tsai, C. R.;Cheng, S. B.;Lin, C.

309,Oral complications associated with treatment of Wilson's disease with D-penicillamine: a clinicopathological report,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder that inhibits hepatic copper release. Multiorgan manifestations affect the liver, nervous system, kidneys, eyes, heart, and skin. Damage to elastic fibers is a complication of the most commonly used drug in the treatment of WD D-penicillamine (D-PCA). These changes have been described very rarely in the oral cavity. The article describes oral complications associated with WD and its treatment by D-PCA. METHODS: Clinical, radiographic, and microscopic examinations were performed on two D-PCA-treated WD patients (28 and 53 years) with clinical and pathological evidence of oral drug-related complications. RESULTS: The lesions included multiple small red papules of the lips, gingival enlargement, early onset periodontitis and recurrent oral candidiasis. Biopsies of the oral mucosa (gingiva, buccal) showed granulomatous inflammation in one case and thick, irregular clumps of tortuous, red-stained, abnormal elastic fibers in both cases. The red papules on the lips resemble elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS). Similar lesions have been described in the skin but never in association with oral or perioral tissues. In addition to the oral lesions, one of the patients developed a general intolerance to the drug and was switched to trientine hydrochloride. CONCLUSIONS: WM patients and others treated with D-PCA may develop oral and perioral complications, which in some cases have features of damaged elastic fibers in the mucosa and periodontal apparatus. It is possible that this damage is one of the factors responsible for poor periodontal health in WM patients. Recognition of the lesions can lead to replacement of the offending therapeutic.",,"Tovaru, S.;Parlatescu, I.;Dumitriu, A.

310,Preparation of polyamine-functionalized copper-specific adsorbents for the selective adsorption of copper,"The level of free serum copper is greatly increased in Wilson's disease. For patients with acute Wilson's disease, liver transplantation is the only life-saving treatment. Plasma exchange or albumin dialysis are often used as a bridge to liver transplantation to maintain a stable clinical status for patients. Hemoperfusion is another effective therapy for removing toxins from the plasma. However, hemoperfusion has not been reported to remove copper due to the lack of copper-specific adsorbent. In this work, copper chelating agents, triethylenetetramine and tetraethylenepentamine, were covalently immobilized on poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate) macroporous microspheres to prepare copper-specific adsorbents. The resulting adsorbents showed good adsorption capacities of 63.44 and 58.48 mg/g for Cu2+ ions. Furthermore, despite interference from other metal ions such as Fe2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, and Ca2+, the prepared copper adsorbents still showed good specificity for Cu2+ ions. These results indicate that the adsorbents are promising adsorbents in hemoperfusion therapy for the selective removal of copper in patients with severe Wilson's disease.

311,Wilson's disease: histopathologic correlations with treatment in follow-up liver biopsies,"AIM: To study the progression of hepatic histopathology in serial liver biopsies from patients with Wilson's disease (WD). METHODS: We report on a cohort of 12 WM patients treated with zinc and/or penicillamine in whom multiple liver biopsies were followed up. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected and all patients underwent an initial biopsy and at least one repeat biopsy. RESULTS: The time to repeat biopsy ranged from 2 to 12 years. Six patients (non-progressors) had stable liver histology or improvement. In one case we observed an improvement in fibrosis from stage 2 to 0. Six patients (progressors) had worsening fibrosis. There was no significant correlation between the histological findings and serum aminotransferases or copper metabolism parameters. Hepatic copper concentration reached normal values in only two patients: one from the non-progressor group and one from the progressor group. The estimated rate of progression of liver fibrosis in the whole group was 0 units per year between the first and second liver biopsy (4 years) and 0.25 between the second and third (3 years). In the group of progressors, the rate of liver fibrosis progression was estimated at 0.11 fibrosis units per year between the first and second biopsy and 0.6 fibrosis units between the second and third biopsy. CONCLUSION: The inability of clinical tools to detect fibrosis progression in WD suggests that liver biopsy with hepatic copper quantification should be considered every 3 years.",,"Cope-Yokoyama, S.;Finegold, M.

312,Kupfermangelmyelopathie,"Acquired copper deficiency has been recognized as a rare cause of anemia and neutropenia for over half a century. Copper deficiency myelopathy (CDM) has only been described in the last decade and represents a treatable cause of noncompressive myelopathy very similar to subacute combined degeneration due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Here, 55 case reports from the literature are reviewed with regard to their demographics, etiology, hematological and biochemical parameters, spinal imaging, treatment, and outcome. The pathophysiology of disorders of copper metabolism is discussed. CDM was most common in the fifth and sixth decades and was more common in women (F:M = 3.6:1). Risk factors included previous upper gastrointestinal surgery, zinc overload and malabsorption syndromes, all of which impair copper absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In 20% of the cases, no etiology was identified. High zinc levels have been noted in some cases that were not considered to be primary zinc overload, and in this situation zinc's contribution to copper deficiency remained unclear. Cytopenias were found in 78%, particularly anemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome may have been misdiagnosed in the past. Spinal MRI was abnormal in 47% and usually showed a high T2 signal in the posterior cervical and thoracic cords. In a clinically compatible case, CDM may be suggested by the presence of one or more risk factors and/or cytopenias. Low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels confirmed the diagnosis, and unlike in Wilson's disease, urinary copper levels were typically low. Treatment included copper supplementation and modification of any risk factors and resulted in hematological normalization and neurological improvement or stabilization. Because every neurologic recovery has been partial, and case numbers of CDM will continue to rise with the increased use of bariatric gastrointestinal surgery, clinical vigilance remains key to minimizing neurologic sequelae. Recommendations for treatment and prevention are given. [References: 91]",,"Jaiser, S. R.;Winston, G. P.",2010,Jun,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00415-010-5511-x,0,0,
313,Evaluation of Cuprimine and Syprin for Decorporation of (60)Co and (210)Po,"The recognized risk of intentional release of radionuclides into the local environment from terrorist activities has led to efforts to improve novel materials and methods for removing internally deposited radionuclides. These decorporation treatments also benefit workers in the nuclear industry should exposure occur. Cuprimine and Syprine are oral therapeutics based on the active ingredients D-penicillamine and N,N'-bis-(2-aminoethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine dihydrochloride, respectively. These therapeutic drugs have been used for several decades to treat Wilson's disease, a genetic defect that results in copper overload, through chelation and accelerated clearance of internally deposited copper. Studies were conducted to evaluate these FDA-approved drugs for the in vivo decoration of radioactive cobalt (Co) and polonium (Po) using male Wistar-Han rats. In these studies, Co or Po was administered to animals by IV injection, followed by oral gavage doses of either cuprimine or syprin. Control animals received only the radionuclide. For co-studies, animals received a single dose of Cuprimine or Syprine, while for po studies, animals were repeatedly dosed at 24-hour intervals for a total of 5 doses. The results show that Syprin significantly increased urinary excretion and skeletal concentrations of Co compared to controls. While cuprimine had little effect on total Co excretion, skeletal, kidney, liver, muscle, and stomach tissues had significantly lower radioactivity compared to control animals. The low total excretion of Po made it difficult to reliably measure urinary or stool radioactivity and draw a definitive conclusion on the effect of cuprimine or syprin treatment on excretion. However, treatment with cuprimine was effective in reducing Po levels in the spleen compared to controls. Similarly, treatment with Syprin resulted in statistically significant reductions in Po in spleen and skeletal tissue compared to control animals. Based on these promising results, further studies evaluating dose-response pharmacokinetic profiles for decorporation are warranted.",,"Levitskaia, T. G.;Creim, J. A.;Curry, T.

314,Urinary copper/zinc ratio: a promising parameter to substitute for 24-hour urinary copper excretion for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in children,"BACKGROUND: Although 24-hour urinary copper excretion is valuable for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, accurate, timed collection presents practical difficulties. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of morning urinary copper/creatinine or copper/zinc ratio as a surrogate parameter for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. METHODS: Five random urine samples collected over 24 hours from two inpatients were used to assess the consistency of urinary copper/creatinine and copper/zinc ratios. The correlation of the ratios with the 24-hour urinary copper excretion was investigated in 15 patients with liver disease. The diagnostic value of the copper/zinc ratio in morning urine was further investigated in 9 children with Wilson's disease and 22 children with other liver diseases. RESULTS: The coefficients of variation over 24 hours in urine copper/creatinine and copper/zinc ratios were 12.5% and 9.3%, respectively. The copper/creatinine ratio in the morning urine, the copper/zinc ratio and the 24-hour urinary copper excretion correlated well. The area under the receiver operating curve was comparable between the copper/zinc ratio in the morning urine and the copper excretion in the 24-hour urine (0.983 vs. 0.977). CONCLUSION: The copper/zinc ratio in morning urine seems to be a promising parameter to replace 24-hour urinary copper excretion for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease.",,"Wang, J. S.;Lu, Y.;Wang, X.

315,Wilson's disease: long-term follow-up of a cohort of 24 patients treated with D-penicillamine,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Detailed data on the long-term efficacy of various drug therapies in Wilson's disease (WD) are lacking. Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed our patient cohort treated with D-penicillamine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study reports on the clinical picture, the diagnosis and the course of the disease in 24 WM patients who were treated long-term (15 +/- 12 years, between 1969 and 2009) with D-penicillamine. RESULTS: The overall survival in our cohort was 91.6%. Twenty-two of 24 patients had liver disease at presentation, 17 of 24 patients (71%) had cirrhosis, 11 of whom had complications of cirrhosis. Six of 11 of these patients showed hepatological improvement (five of six) or stabilization (one of six), three of 11 were transplanted, one of 11 died, and one of 11 dropped out of follow-up. Six out of 17 cirrhotic patients without complications improved (four out of six) or stabilized (two out of six). Of all other patients (seven of 24), five of seven showed improvement (three of five) or stabilization (two of five), hepatological deterioration occurred in only one patient due to poor therapy compliance, and one of seven dropped out of follow-up away. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were present in 13/24 at presentation and resolved in 1/13, resolved in 7/13, stabilized in 4/13, and worsened in 1/13 patients (due to poor compliance). In general, we observed a favorable hepatological and neurological development with D-penicillamine. CONCLUSION: Despite the presence of hepatic disease or neuropsychiatric symptoms at baseline in all but one of the patients, we report positive results in hepatic and neurological disease after very long treatment with D-penicillamine, confirming its reputation as ""first line therapy in WD .",,"Lowette, K.

316,Tetrathiomolybdate inhibits copper-transporting proteins through metal cluster formation,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is an orally active compound used to treat disorders of copper metabolism. Here we describe how TM inhibits proteins that regulate copper physiology. Crystallographic results show that the surprising stability of the drug complex with the metallochaperon Atx1 is due to the formation of a sulfur-bridged copper–molybdenum cluster reminiscent to those found in molybdenum and iron-sulfur proteins. Spectroscopic studies indicate that this cluster is stable in solution and corresponds to physiological clusters isolated from TM-treated animal models of Wilson's disease. Finally, mechanistic studies show that the drug metallochaperon inhibits metal transfer functions between copper-transporting proteins. The results are consistent with a model in which TM can directly and reversibly downregulate copper delivery to secreted metalloenzymes and suggest that proteins involved in metal regulation could be fertile drug targets.",,"Alvarez, H.

317,"Copper and zinc in the serum, urine and hair of patients with Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine and zinc","The aim of this study was to determine the different concentrations of copper and zinc in the serum, urine and hair of the head of patients with Wilson's disease receiving various currently accepted treatments to reduce copper exposure (penicillamine group 1, n = 8; zinc group 2 , n = 8; penicillamine + zinc group 3, n = 8). Blood, urine and hair samples were taken from the patients. All three treatments resulted in a significant decrease in serum copper levels. Significantly increased serum zinc levels were found in patients in groups 2 and 3 (19.1 and 18.8 micromol/l, respectively; p<0.05). Urinary copper excretion increased significantly during dosing in groups 1 and 3 (11.5 and 7.94 micromol/24 h, respectively; p<0.001) due to the effect of penicillamine. Administration of zinc as monotherapy (group 2) or in combination with penicillamine (group 3) resulted in an increase in its excretion (25.3 and 22.4 micromol/24 h, respectively; p<0.01). Only an insignificant increase in the copper content in the hair was observed in all three patient groups. The zinc content in the hair did not differ significantly from the control group in any of the groups.",,"Dastych, M.;Prochazkova, D.;Pokorny, A.;Zdrazil, L.",2010,Mar,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-009-8438-2,0,1,
318,Zinc and tetrathiomolybdate for the treatment of Wilson's disease and the potential efficacy of anticopper therapy in a variety of diseases,"Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation and copper toxicity primarily in the liver and brain, has been the engine that has propelled the development of anticopper drugs. Here we first briefly look at Wilson's disease and then the four anti-copper drugs used to treat Wilson's disease. We then discuss the results of anticopper drug therapy in Wilson's disease, with particular emphasis on the newer and better drugs, zinc and tetrathiomolybdate. We then discuss new areas of anticopper therapy, reducing copper availability with tetrathiomolybdate as a therapy for fibrotic, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases. Many of the cytokines that promote these diseases are copper-dependent, and reducing copper availability decreases the activity of these cytokines, which favorably affects a variety of disease processes. Copper in the blood can be imagined as in two basins. One pool is covalently bound to ceruloplasmin, a protein containing six coppers that is synthesized by the liver and secreted into the blood. Ceruloplasmin copper makes up almost 85 to 90% of blood copper in normal people. This copper is tightly bound and not readily available for cellular uptake and copper toxicity. The other 10-15% of copper is more loosely bound to albumin and other small molecules in the blood and is readily and freely available to cells and can cause copper toxicity if this copper pool is increased. We call this latter pool of copper ""free"" copper because of its easier availability. However, it should be understood that it is not completely free as it is always bound to albumin and other molecules. It is this pool of free copper that is greatly expanded in untreated Wilson's patients undergoing copper toxicity.",,"Brewer, G. J.",2009,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b901614g,0,0,
319,Health implications of the discovery of human zinc deficiency,"The essence of zinc was recognized 46 years ago. Zinc deficiency, which leads to growth retardation, hypogonadism, immune dysfunction and cognitive impairment, affects nearly 2 billion people in the developing world. High phytate content of the grain proteins consumed in developing countries leads to reduced availability of zinc for absorption. Zinc therapy was a very successful and life-saving measure in patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica and Wilson's disease. Positive therapeutic responses to zinc supplementation have been observed in acute diarrhea in children, chronic hepatitis C, shigellosis, leprosy, leishmaniasis, and the common cold. Zinc supplementation was effective in reducing the incidence of infections in the elderly and those with sickle cell anemia. Zinc supplementation was effective in preventing blindness in 25% of older people with dry age-related macular degeneration. Zinc supplementation in the elderly decreased oxidative stress and reduced the formation of inflammatory cytokines. Zinc is an intracellular signaling molecule in monocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages and plays an important role in cell-mediated immune functions and oxidative stress. Zinc is also an anti-inflammatory agent. These unique properties of zinc can have significant therapeutic benefits in several human diseases. In many diseases, concomitant zinc deficiency can complicate clinical features, adversely affect immunological status, increase oxidative stress, and increase the formation of inflammatory cytokines. Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation can play important causative roles in many chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, various malignancies, neurological disorders, and autoimmune diseases. It is therefore important that zinc status is assessed and zinc deficiency corrected in these chronic conditions. A controlled clinical study of zinc supplementation in these conditions to document the preventive and therapeutic effects of zinc is warranted. [References: 43]",,"Prasad, A. S.",2009,Jun,,0,0,112.0
320,Zinc: an essential micronutrient,"Zinc is an essential micronutrient for human metabolism that catalyzes more than 100 enzymes, facilitates protein folding and helps regulate gene expression. Patients with malnutrition, alcoholism, inflammatory bowel disease and malabsorption syndromes are at increased risk of zinc deficiency. Symptoms of zinc deficiency are nonspecific, including growth retardation, diarrhea, alopecia, glossitis, nail dystrophy, decreased immunity, and hypogonadism in males. In developing countries, zinc supplementation may be effective in preventing upper respiratory tract infections and diarrhea, and as an adjunctive treatment for diarrhea in malnourished children. Zinc combined with antioxidants may be moderately effective in slowing the progression of moderate and advanced age-related macular degeneration. Zinc is an effective treatment for Wilson's disease. Current data do not support zinc supplementation as effective for upper respiratory tract infection, wound healing, or human immunodeficiency virus. Zinc is well tolerated at recommended dosages. Adverse effects of long-term use of high-dose zinc include suppressed immunity, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, anemia, copper deficiency, and possible urogenital complications.

322,The reduced expression of ATP7B caused by mutations causing Wilson's disease is rescued by the pharmacological folding chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate and curcumin,"UNLABELING: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive copper overload disorder of the liver and basal ganglia. WD is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes ATP7B, a protein localized in the trans-Golgi network that primarily facilitates hepatic copper excretion. Current treatment includes reducing circulating copper with zinc supplementation or copper chelation. Despite treatment, a significant number of patients experience neurological deterioration. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that defects arising from some WD mutations are ameliorated by drug treatment aimed at improving protein folding and restoring protein function. This required a systematic characterization of the molecular consequences of different ATP7B missense mutations associated with WD. With the exception of p.S1363F, all mutations tested (p.G85V, p.R778L, p.H1069Q, p.C1104F, p.V1262F, p.G1343V and p.S1363F) resulted in reduced ATP7B protein expression, while messenger RNA -Frequency was not affected. Retention of mutated ATP7B in the endoplasmic reticulum, increased protein expression and normalization of localization after culturing the cells at 30 degrees C and homology modeling indicated that these proteins were misfolded. Four different mutations showed residual copper export capacity, while other mutations resulted in a complete disruption of copper export by ATP7B. Treatment with the pharmacological chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) and curcumin, a clinically approved compound, partially restored protein expression in most ATP7B mutants. CONCLUSION: These results could enable new treatment strategies in WD by directly enhancing protein expression of mutant ATP7B with residual copper export activity. 1795.).",,"van den Berghe, P.

323,Morbus Wilson: One Indian Perspektive,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder in which copper transport through the hepatic lysosomes is disrupted. It leads to excessive copper deposition in the liver, brain, kidneys and skeletal system, which most commonly affects children or young adults and is invariably fatal if not adequately treated with decoppering therapy. The last century has seen several changes, among which are notable: increased awareness, improved diagnostic possibilities leading to earlier detection even in the pre-symptomatic phase, clear differentiation from their imitators, aggressive therapeutic approaches due to the availability of effective treatments, and an overall reduction in of morbidity and mortality. It is generally accepted that the disease is not as rare as was once thought. Sir SAK Wilson published his seminal article in 1912, but it was not until 1968 that the first patient with WD was reported from our country. Publications from India on WD have focused on phenotypic characterization, documentation of lesser known aspects of the disease e.g. B. Seizures, behavioral abnormalities, language and cognitive impairment, subclinical impairment of visual pathways, cardiac and autonomic function, and pre-symptomatic detection. Attempts have been made to understand the clinical heterogeneity of the disease through identification of biochemical and immunological markers, magnetic resonance imaging, neuropathological studies, and genetic analysis for new and/or known mutations. Assessment of impairment and severity, and the effect of various therapeutic interventions, particularly zinc sulfate, on long-term outcome and quality of life were also examined. However, clinicians often face difficulties in the long-term care of these patients. Diagnostic errors, leading to delays in diagnosis and initiation of treatment, are common even in patients with a positive family history. There is no consensus on therapeutic protocols as the use of penicillamine, once a ""gold standard"" for treatment, has been debated by experts. Mortality and morbidity from this potentially treatable disease and the unavailability of medicines for poor patients remain a concern.",,"Taly, A. B.;Prashanth, L.

Molecular diagnostics have improved and complemented current biochemical and clinical methods for screening for Wilson disease. Screening for Wilson disease in newborns is feasible and has been tested in limited populations but is not yet widely implemented. Identification of patients with Wilson's disease as the cause of acute liver failure is possible using standard biochemical tests. Treatments for Wilson disease include chelating agents and zinc salts, and liver transplantation. Future therapies may include hepatocyte transplantation and gene therapy, both of which have been tested in animal models of Wilson's disease and shown to be effective. Future human studies await advances in these areas. [References: 27]",,"Schilsky, M. L.",2009,Oct,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2009.07.012,0,0,

328,Treatment of Wilson's disease with tetrathiomolybdate: V. Control of free copper by tetrathiomolybdate and a comparison with trientine,"It has become clear that ""free"" serum copper (the copper not bound to ceruloplasmin in the blood) is the copper that causes copper toxicity in Wilson's disease. But until now, free copper has not been closely monitored at the start of anti-copper therapy in neurological patients. During this phase of initial therapy, the fate of these patients hangs in the balance - if they deteriorate neurologically, as often occurs with penicillamine or trientine therapy, many never recover. We hypothesize that free copper levels are a biological marker of clinical outcome in these patients. In this article, we evaluate the control of free copper in 3 studies of initial anticopper treatment in patients with neurological Wilson's disease. The first (Study 1) is an open-label study of 55 patients on tetrathiomolybdate, the second (Study 2) is a double-blind study of 48 patients comparing tetrathiomolybdate and trientine, and the third (Study 3) is a 40-patient study -Study double-blind comparison of 2 disease regimens of tetrathiomolybdate. Free copper levels were determined by subtracting ceruloplasmin and tetrathiomolybdate-bound copper from total serum copper. Tetrathiomolybdate demonstrated very strong control of free copper levels during 8 weeks of treatment in the open-label study of 55 patients (Study 1), reducing them to a mean of about a quarter or less of baseline. In the tetrathiomolybdate/trientine double-blind study (Study 2), tetrathiomolybdate again showed good control of free copper levels over 8 weeks of treatment, which is significantly better than trientine. In the trientine arm of Study 2, mean free copper levels actually increased during trientine therapy. The 5 patients whose neurological deterioration worsened with trientine therapy over 8 weeks of treatment had significant peaks in serum free copper levels that coincided with their neurological deterioration over time. Patients who did not deteriorate neurologically did not generally show significant spikes in free copper. Tetrathiomolybdate controlled copper less well in the dosing regimen study (Study 3) than in the previous 2 studies of tetrathiomolybdate treatment, probably due to a change in the way tetrathiomolybdate was administered 'extra-food'.",,"Brewer, G.

330,Status epilepticus bei Wilson's Disease,"Rationale: Seizures occur in Wilson disease (WD), with prevalence rates up to 4-6% in specialized academic centers, but status epilepticus is rare. We report on a patient with WD who developed non-convulsive status epilepticus (SE) during therapy with tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) and review the relevant literature over the past 20 years. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old right-handed man with WD, presenting with Parkinson's features and liver cirrhosis, was admitted for seizures. Seizures began at week 4 of treatment with TTM (phase III study of tetrathiomolybdate dosing regimen in neurological Wilson's disease). Seizures were characterized by forced clonic eye, right head deviation and right arm posture, followed by unresponsiveness, bilateral eye blinking, and right hand automatisms. The EEG confirmed frequent left-sided seizures. He developed nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) with electrographic seizures every 5 to 10 minutes, each lasting 1 to 2 minutes. Seizures were controlled within 24 hours with fosphenytoin, midazolam, and levetiracetam. Brain MRI showed diffuse atrophy, mineralization of the basal ganglia, and patchy FLAIR elevation signal in the left frontal lobe. LITERATURE REVIEW: We found reports of 6 WD patients with SE, two at disease onset and before copper removal treatment, and four after months to years of treatment with D-penicillamine. CONCLUSION: SE is rare in WD and our case is the only one reported to develop SE during treatment with TTM. Because the literature documents two patients with WD who developed SE prior to treatment with copper deposits, our hypothesis is that seizures in WD may be the result of disease progression or a combination of factors, but are not necessarily attributable to treatment alone.",,"Pestana Knight, E.

335,Improvement in resolution of liver fibrosis in an animal model by tetrathiomolybdate,"The background to this study is that we observed some improvement in cirrhosis in patients with Wilson's disease treated with the anticopper drug zinc, and another anticopper drug, tetrathiomolybdate, completely prevented liver fibrosis in the carbon tetrachloride mouse model. We believe that in existing cirrhosis there is a delicate balance between fibrosis formation and fibrosis resolution, which can be pushed towards resolution by anti-copper drugs. Thus, in this study, we induced liver fibrosis in mice by treatment with carbon tetrachloride, then gave half of the fibrotic mice tetrathiomolybdate for 3 months, while the other half of the fibrotic mice received nothing for 3 months and served as controls. Tetrathiomolybdate caused a dramatic and significant reduction in fibrosis, as measured by hydroxyproline levels (the main amino acid constituent of collagen), almost back to baseline compared to controls, which showed only a slight and non-significant reduction. It is clear from this animal study that resolution of pre-existing fibrosis can be strongly catalyzed by lowering copper levels with tetrathiomolybdate.

340,Reactivity and kinetic studies of (NH4)2(MoS4) in acidic aqueous solution: possible relevance to the angiostatic function of the MoS4(2-) ligand,"Although it is known that the addition of mineral acids to WS(4)(2-) in water leads to the aggregation and formation of various polynuclear thiotungstate anions, it is reported that the acidic hydrolysis of the MoS(4)(2-) anion is mainly MoS( 3) or MoS(2) as hydrolysis products. Knowledge of the resulting products from such reactions has implications for the use of tetrathiomolybdate (MoS(4)(2-)) both as a potential antitumor drug and for the treatment of Wilson's disease. In this study, the reaction of HCl with MoS(4)(2-) in water was monitored as a function of time. Reaction mixtures, both 1:1 and 2:1 molar ratios of acid to MoS(4)(2-) were studied, as well as MoS(4)(2-) reactions in simulated human gastric fluids at a pH of about 2 and 3 Monitoring by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and UV-Vis spectroscopy has clearly shown the formation of complex mixtures of multinuclear thiomolybdates (Mo(2)-Mo(18)).

A prospective study of 5 patients with Wilson's disease who took and did not take D-penicillamine for a period of 9.5 years showed subclinical hypothyroidism. D-penicillamine probably inhibited thyroperoxidase activity in utero in healthy infants and during infancy in patients with Wilson's disease.,,"Hanukoglu, A.;Curiel, B.;Berkowitz, D.;Levine, A.;Sack, J.;Lorberboym, M.",2008,Dec,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2008.06.015,0,0,
342,High frequency of c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) mutation in ATP7B gene in Lithuanian patients with hepatic presentation of Wilson's disease,"AIM: To study the prevalence of ATP7B gene mutation in patients with hepatic presentation of Wilson's disease (WD) in Lithuania. METHODS: Eleven unrelated Lithuanian families, including 13 WD patients, were tested. Clinically, the WM diagnosis was made according to the Leipzig scoring system. Genomic DNA was extracted from venous whole blood using a salt precipitation method. First, the semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used to detect the c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) mutation. Patients not homozygous for the c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) mutation were further analyzed. The 21 exons of the WD gene were amplified in a thermal cycler (Biometra T3 thermal cycler, Goettingen, Germany). Direct sequencing of the amplified PCR products was performed by cycle sequencing using fluorescent dye terminators in an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). RESULTS: A total of 13 WM patients (mean age 26.4 years; range 17-40; males/females 3/10) with liver disease and 16 of their first-degree relatives (including 12 siblings) were studied. Some WM patients had extrahepatic disorders (hemolytic anemia 3; Fanconi syndrome 1; neuropsychiatric and behavioral disorder 2) in addition to hepatic symptoms. Liver biopsy specimens were available from all 13 WM patients (8 had cirrhosis; 1 - chronic hepatitis; 3 - acute hepatic failure, 1 - fatty liver). Twelve of 13 (92.3%) WD patients had the c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) mutation, 6 of them in both chromosomes, 6 were identified as composite heterozygotes with additional c.3472-82delGGTTTAACCAT, c.3402delC, c. 3121C>T (p.R1041W) or unknown mutations. No mutations were found in one patient with liver cirrhosis and psychiatric disorder (Leipzig score 6). Of 16 first-degree relatives of WD, 11 (68.7%) were heterozygous for the c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) mutation. Two patients with fulminant WM died of acute liver failure and 11 are in complete remission on penicillamine or zinc acetate treatment. Three women with WD have successfully delivered healthy babies. CONCLUSION: The missense mutation c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) is the most characteristic mutation for Lithuanian patients with WM. As much as 92.3% of WD patients with hepatic presentation of the disease are homozygous or composite heterozygous for the p.H1069Q mutation.",,"Kucinskas, L.;Jeroch, J.;Vitkauskiene, A.;Sakalauskas, R.;Petrenkiene, V.;Kucinskas, V.;Naginiene, R.;Schmidt, H.;Kupcinskas, L.",2008,2014-10-01 00:00:00,,0,1,
343,The risks of free copper in the body and the development of useful anti-copper drugs,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the toxicity and risks of free copper in Wilson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, other neurodegenerative disorders and cognitive loss in the general population. We will also examine anti-copper drugs and how lowering free copper levels with an anti-copper drug inhibits fibrosis, inflammation and autoimmunity. RECENT RESULTS: Some exciting recent work suggests that free copper levels are elevated in Alzheimer's disease and that copper may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, paving the way for a potential anticopper therapy for Alzheimer's disease. Medication levels. Copper may also be involved in other neurodegenerative disorders. A very exciting recent study indicates that high copper intake, primarily from copper supplements, coupled with a high-fat diet leads to faster cognitive decline in the general population. Other data indicate that even small concentrations of copper in drinking water, possibly similar to copper supplements that bypass the liver, can enter the circulatory system, increase copper's blood-brain penetration and cause damage. SUMMARY: Some of the implications are that Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, as well as fibrotic, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases, may be treatable by reducing the availability of free copper. People in the general population may wish to take steps to lower their levels of free copper, and in particular to refrain from taking copper supplements and consuming significant amounts of copper in their drinking water.

345,Wilson's disease in Taiwan,"Wilson disease (WD) has been studied in Taiwan since the 1960s. The study can be divided into three periods: (1) The first period was the 1960s, represented by the work of Drs. JB Tu, assigned to US Naval Medical Research Unit No. 2 (NAMRU-2) worked; (2) The second period was the 1970s, represented by the work of Dr. ML Leu who also worked in NAMRU-2. During these two periods, D-penicillamine was introduced to Taiwan via NAMRU-2, primarily as a study drug; and (3) the third period was the 1980s and after. Tu and Leu reported the clinical manifestations, tissue concentrations of copper, and therapeutic effects of d-penicillamine, including cupriuresis, reduction in tissue copper levels, and prognosis. Our studies after the 1980s included clinical manifestations, evoked potentials to demonstrate the extent of CNS involvement, the impact of superimposed hepatitis B infection on clinical manifestations and prognosis, and WD involving cerebral white matter.

The University of Michigan drug has been licensed to Pipex Pharmaceuticals Inc. for development in multiple indications; Development of the cancer drug was later licensed to Attenuon LLC. In a phase III clinical trial, TTM stabilized neurological function in patients with Wilson's disease and resulted in significant recovery in 81% of patients 3 years after the start of therapy; At the time of publication, a second phase III study was ongoing. A phase I/II clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of TTM in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, prompting the FDA to grant TTM orphan drug designation for this disease. Several phase II clinical trials had also been completed in patients with different types of cancer and showed mixed efficacy. TTM was also evaluated in a phase I clinical trial for age-related macular degeneration, but the results reported from the trial were negative; There has been no further development for this indication. TTM has been studied in a phase II clinical trial for the treatment of psoriasis, but no data have been reported. At the time of publication, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials were ongoing in patients with Alzheimer's disease and primary biliary cirrhosis, respectively. The most common clinical side effects observed with TTM across the indication spectrum were anaemia, neutropenia, leukopenia and transaminase elevations. These side effects were generally resolved with either dose adjustment or temporary interruption of the dosing regimen. It is predicted that TTM will most likely find a niche in the treatment of Wilson's disease, for which current treatment options are limited. [References: 83]",,"Medici, V.;Sturniolo, G.

347,Analysis of renal dysfunction in children with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Because the various manifestations of renal dysfunction occur at different stages of Wilson's disease, misdiagnosis or misdiagnosis is not uncommon. This study was conducted to determine the clinical features of renal dysfunction in children with Wilson's disease or hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD). Methods: 85 children with HLD treated in our department between January 1991 and June 2006 were retrospectively examined. Clinical data from 25 patients with renal impairment were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 85 HLD patients, 34 had renal dysfunction. Nine of the 34 patients treated with D-penicillamine were excluded. Of the remaining 25 patients, 7 had onset of symptoms of renal dysfunction, 5 with edema, 1 with gross hematuria, and 1 with acute hemolysis and acute renal failure. Twelve of the 25 patients had proteinuria, 14 had hematuria, and 5 had both proteinuria and hematuria. Urine glucose was positive in 4 patients, urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) was elevated in 5, and urinary beta2-microglobulin was elevated in 6. The phase of urinary red blood cells (RBC) was detected in 7 patients, including glomerular hematuria in 5 patients and non-glomerular hematuria in 2. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine increased in 1 patient. B-ultrasound showed bilateral enlarged kidneys in 3 patients. Renal biopsy showed diffuse mesangial proliferation and IgA deposition in the mesangial region in one patient. All 25 patients had a corneal KF ring and ceruloplasmin levels decreased. Six patients had a family history of HLD. CONCLUSIONS: The manifestations of renal dysfunction with HLD are diverse. HLD should be ruled out in patients with unexplained renal impairment, while patients with HLD should have renal studies to identify renal dysfunction. We suggest regular monitoring of renal function and urinalysis in patients treated with D-penicillamine.",,"Zhuang, X. H.;Mo, Y.;Jiang, X. Y.;Chen, S.

349,Diagnosis of Wilson's disease: a comprehensive review,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The guilty gene is ATP7B. The worldwide prevalence is about 1 in 30,000, which can vary by population. Higher prevalence rates have been reported using more sensitive screening techniques and screening pilot populations. Typical presentations include neuropsychiatric and hepatic dysfunction, while atypical presentations are diverse. Diagnosis is based on high clinical suspicion, typical neurological symptoms, the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and decreased serum ceruloplasmin concentration. The usual value of < 0.20 g/l is not a universal diagnostic value. The interpretation of these values should take into account the age of the subjects and analytical variability. Patients with inconclusive findings require further investigations such as 24-hour urinary free copper excretion, penicillamine challenge test, liver copper measurement, and detection of gene mutations. Direct molecular diagnostics remain the crucial tool. Other tests such as copper not bound to ceruloplasmin are unreliable. Potential pitfalls and limitations of these diagnostic markers are critically reviewed in this paper. The mainstays of therapy are trientine, penicillamine and/or zinc. Liver transplantation is life-saving for patients with advanced disease. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and serum free copper concentration should be monitored in patients on long-term decopper therapy to prevent iatrogenic copper deficiency. [References: 198]",,"Mak, C.

Voxels were located in the globus pallidus (right, left). We followed 17 newly diagnosed WM cases over a one-year period. During this observation period, 6 neurological and 9 hepatic patients improved while 2 neurological patients deteriorated. Pre-treatment (1)H-MRS analysis showed statistically significantly lower mI/Cr, NAA/Cr and higher Lip/Cr in all WM patients with improvement compared to controls. In patients with hepatic symptoms, a statistically significant increase in mI/Cr and Glx/Cr was observed on the second (1)H-MRS (1 year after treatment). A statistically significant increase in NAA/Cr was observed in patients with neurological improvement after treatment at follow-up (1)H-MRS. During neurological deterioration, a decrease in Glx/Cr and NAA/Cr was observed, in contrast to another neurologically impaired patient with exacerbation of liver failure, where a decrease in mI/Cr and an increase in Glx/Cr was observed. The changes in NAA/Cr ratio in neurologically compromised patients and mI/Cr and Glx/Cr in patients with liver failure could be a sensitive marker of clinical recovery and deterioration in these WM patients.

352,Utility of penicillamine-stimulated urinary copper excretion in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in adults,"OBJECTIVE: Diagnosis of Wilson disease (WD) relies on liver biopsy (LB) and measurement of hepatic copper. The aim of this study was to determine the utility of penicillamine-stimulated urinary copper excretion (PS-UCE), a non-invasive diagnostic test, for the diagnosis of WM in adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study of patients suspected of having WM, total serum copper, ceruloplasmin, basal 24-h UCE, and PS-UCE were measured. LB with copper determination was performed in patients with persistent hypertransaminasemia and low ceruloplasmin or basal UCE > 40 micrograms/24 h. Diagnosis was made when ceruloplasmin levels were < 20 mg/dl and hepatic copper > 250 micrograms/g. Results. A total of 115 patients were examined; LB was performed in 43 and WD was diagnosed in 6 (13.9%). Significant differences between WD and non-WD patients were observed for basal UCE (WD: median 134.3 micrograms/24 h versus non-WD: median 19.0 micrograms/24 hours (p<0.05)) and PS -UCE (WD: median 1284.0 micrograms) found/24 h versus non-WD: median 776.0 micrograms/24 h; p<0.01). In receiver-operated curve (ROC) analysis, PS-UCE was the best discriminant between WD and non-WD (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.911, best cut-off 1057 micrograms/24 h, 100% sensitivity, 82.3 % specificity). CONCLUSIONS: PS-UCE is likely to be a useful non-invasive test in the diagnosis of WM, improving patient selection for diagnostic liver biopsy.

No data on bone mineral density (BMD) in children with Wilson's disease (WD) has been published to date. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of osteoporosis in childhood MV and to observe the likely beneficial effects of penicillamine and zinc therapy on osteoporosis. METHODS: Thirty-one children with newly diagnosed MV and sex and 16 age-matched healthy children were included. The mean age was 9.0 +/- 3.2 years (2 to 16 years). Bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD were measured on admission and reassessed in 13 cases after 1 year of treatment with penicillamine and zinc. RESULTS: The patients' mean BMD, BMC, and Z-scores were significantly lower than those of healthy children: 0.52 +/- 0.09 versus 0.72 +/- 0.09 (p=0.001), 19 .27 +/- 13.01 versus 29.67 +/- 14.23 (P = 0.009) and -2.33 +/- 1.28 versus -0.12 +/- 0.31 (P = 0.001) . The prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in children with WD was found to be 22.6% and 67.7%, respectively. BMD and BMC scores were higher in children with neurological involvement. The severity of the disease had no influence on the parameters mentioned. A one-year treatment with penicillamine and zinc did not change the parameters mentioned significantly.

AIM: To describe the clinical features and psychopathology of patients with WM who had initial or predominant psychiatric manifestations. PATIENT AND METHODS: Records of 15 patients with WD (M:F: 11:4) from a large cohort of 350 patients with predominant psychiatric manifestations at baseline were reviewed. Their initial diagnosis, demographic profile, family history, premorbid personality, clinical manifestations, treatment, and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: Their mean age at diagnosis was 19.8 +/- 5.8 years. Six patients were of consanguineous descent and two patients each had a family history of WM and a history of psychiatric disorders. Diagnosis of WM was supported by evidence of KF rings (all), observation of antipsychotic drug sensitivity (n=2), history of jaundice (n=2), and family history suggestive of WM (n=9). , supposed. Psychiatric manifestations could be classified as affective disorder spectrum (n=11) and schizophreniform illness (n=3). While psychiatric symptoms improved in five patients with decoppering therapy, seven patients also required symptomatic treatment. Three of the four patients who responded to decoppering therapy were sensitive to neuroleptics. Long-term follow-up of 10 patients showed variable recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Young patients with psychiatric manifestations with evidence such as a history of jaundice, family history of neuropsychiatric manifestations, and sensitivity to antipsychotic drugs should be evaluated for WD to avoid delay in diagnosis and associated morbidity.

361,"Withdrawal of penicillamine from zinc sulfate penicillamine maintenance therapy in Wilson's disease: promising, safe, and cheap","BACKGROUND: Penicillamine, once considered the cornerstone of treatment for Wilson's disease (WD), is fairly expensive and toxic, often causing neurological deterioration. Zinc sulfate, aimed at treating free copper toxicosis, has emerged as an effective, safe, and inexpensive alternative. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of withdrawal of penicillamine from maintenance therapy with penicillamine and zinc sulfate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 45 patients with WM (M:F: 28:17; age at diagnosis: 13.5+/-63 years) receiving both penicillamine (P) and zinc sulfate (Zn) were unable to use penicillamine for financial reasons not continue restrictions. Their clinical data, disability and impairment scores (Schwab and England (S&E) score, Neurological Symptom Score (NSS), and Chu staging) and follow-up data from patients treated with zinc sulfate alone were recorded. RESULTS: The majority of patients (84.4%) had neuropsychiatric manifestations. The median duration of treatment with penicillamine (P) and zinc sulfate (P+Zn) before stopping penicillamine was 107.4 +/- 67.3 months. 40 patients improved variably, the rest did not. They received only zinc sulfate for 27.2 +/- 8.5 months (range: 12 to 34) and 44 patients (97.7%) remained with status quo or improved slightly. Only one patient reported worsening dysarthria. Their disability and impairment scores during the combination (penicillamine and zinc sulfate) and Zn alone were: Chu (1.3+/-0.5 vs. 1.5+/-1.9; p=0.4), NSS ( 1.8+/-3.1 vs 1.5+/-2.3; p=0.03) and S&E (96.4+/-5.6 vs 98.6+/-3.5 ; p=0.03). There were no side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Discontinuation of penicillamine from zinc sulfate/penicillamine maintenance therapy in patients with Wilson's disease was effective, safe, and economical for almost all patients.

362,Effect of penicillamine and zinc on iron metabolism in Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: The physiology of iron metabolism in Wilson's disease is poorly understood and there are few data on the actual presence and progression of iron accumulation. The purpose of this study was to determine parameters of iron metabolism, including hepatic iron concentration, in subsequent liver biopsies and serum, and urinary pro-hepcidin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with Wilson's disease undergoing long-term treatment were included in the study. RESULTS: Hepatic iron levels were significantly increased in penicillamine-treated patients compared to zinc-treated patients. Serum and urine pro-hepcidin concentrations were significantly higher in patients with Wilson's disease than in healthy subjects, despite a normal biochemical pattern of iron metabolism. Conclusions: Long-term penicillamine treatment seems to be responsible for a more pronounced accumulation of iron in the liver. This observation may warrant a review of long-term treatment modalities of Wilson's disease with penicillamine. The finding that serum and urinary pro-hepcidin is significantly elevated in patients with Wilson's disease compared to healthy subjects suggests a role for hepcidin in iron metabolism in Wilson's disease, but this needs to be supported by a study of hepatic hepcidin expression in these patients are confirmed.",,"Medici, V.;Di Leo, V.;Lamboglia, F.;Bowlus, C.

363,Mowat Wilson Syndrome,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by a distinct facial phenotype (high forehead, frontal hump, large eyebrows, medially flared and sparse in the midsection, hypertelorism, deep-set but large eyes, large and raised ear). lobes, with a central depression, saddle nose with a prominent rounded nasal tip, prominent columella, open mouth, with an M-shaped upper lip, frequent smiles, and a prominent but narrow and triangular pointed chin), moderate to severe intellectual disability, including epilepsy, and variable congenital malformations Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), anomalies of the urogenital tract (particularly hypospadias in males), congenital heart defects, agenesis of the corpus callosum and ocular anomalies. The prevalence of MWS is currently unknown, but 171 patients have been reported to date. It seems likely that MWS is underdiagnosed, particularly in patients without HSCR. MWS is caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions in the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 gene, ZEB2, formerly called ZFHX1B (SIP1). To date, over 100 deletions/mutations have been reported in patients with a typical phenotype; they are often whole gene deletions or truncated mutations, suggesting that haploinsufficiency is the major pathological mechanism. Genotype-phenotype analysis studies show that facial morphology and delayed psychomotor development are constant clinical features, while the frequent and severe congenital anomalies are variable. In a small number of patients, unusual mutations can result in an atypical phenotype. The facial phenotype is particularly important for initial clinical diagnosis and represents the hallmark that warrants ZEB2 mutational analysis, even in the absence of HSCR. The majority of MWS cases reported to date have been sporadic, so the risk of recurrence is low. Nevertheless, rare cases of sibling recurrence have been observed. Congenital malformations and seizures require early clinical evaluation with the intervention of multiple specialists (including neonatologists and pediatricians). Psychomotor development is delayed in all patients, so rehabilitation (physiotherapy, psychomotor and speech therapy) should be started as soon as possible.

364,D-penicillamine-induced ANCA-associated crescentic glomerulonephritis in Wilson's disease,"Several drugs, including hydralazine and propylthiouracil, can induce antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. d-Penicillamine has been associated in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic sclerosis, but ANCA-associated vasculitides in the absence of drug have been described in patients with both diseases. Therefore, the role of treatment with d-penicillamine could not be established. We report the first case of antimyeloperoxidase antibody-associated vasculitis in a patient treated with D-penicillamine for Wilson's disease. Since Wilson's disease has never been associated with ANCA-related nephritis, this case strongly supports that D-penicillamine can induce ANCA vasculitis. The appearance and rapidly progressive and potentially serious outcome of this complication contrasts dramatically with that of the membranous and minimally altered glomerulopathy also induced by the sulfhydryl compound.",,"Bienaime, F.;Clerbaux, G.;Plaisier, E.;Mougenot, B.;Ronco, P.;Rougier, J.

365,Central pontine signaling changes in Wilson's disease: distinct MRI morphology and sequential changes with decoppering therapy,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reports of central pontine myelinolysis (CPM)-like changes in Wilson's disease (WD) and their sequential changes are exceptional. The aim was to examine the MRI characteristics of CPM-like changes in WD and the serial changes. METHODS: Of the 121 patients with WD, 20 (M:F:9:11, age at onset: 14.2 +/- 4.6 years) had characteristics similar to CPM. All had a progressive neuropsychiatric form of WD. All but five were in a decoppering treatment. None had acute deterioration or liver failure. Ten patients underwent repeat studies. RESULTS: Twenty patients with CPM-like changes presented with the characteristic phenotype of WD. Three distinct patterns of CPM-like changes were observed: (a) distinctive round shape -7, (b) ""bipartite"" -9, and (c) ""tripartite"" -4. Only one showed signal changes indicative of extrapontine myelinolysis. All patients had contiguous midbrain involvement. Serial MRI evaluations in 10 patients with a mean interval of 17.4 +/- 13.2 months showed complete reversal in one, partial improvement in five and no change in three. Clinical and MRI improvements occurred pari passu except in one case. CONCLUSIONS: CPM-like changes in WD may be underrecognized and distinct from the well-known “osmotic demyelination”. It is potentially reversible, similar to other WD MRI features.",,"Sinha, S.;Taly, A. B.;Ravishankar, S.;Prashanth, L. K.;Vasudev, M.

366,Importance of copper determination in late onset Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting from dysfunction of a copper-transporting P-type ATPase encoded on chromosome 13. When the storage capacity of the liver is exceeded, the excess copper manifests itself in toxic effects. This article reports the sudden, unexpected death of a 22-year-old woman from a subclinical course of Wilson's disease. METHODS/RESULTS: A woman with no history of underlying liver disease was hospitalized nine days before death because of severe hemolytic anemia of unknown cause. Poisoning by lead, mercury, cadmium, thallium, zinc, chromium, manganese and arsenic compounds were ruled out. High levels of copper in blood and urine (AAS method) were found (blood: 3.90 micrograms/ml, urine: 8.10 micrograms/ml, 12,140 micrograms/24 h; normal - blood: 0.88 micrograms/ml, urine: 0.051 micrograms/ml). , < 51 micrograms/24 h). Symptomatic treatment targeting multiple organ failure was initiated immediately. Despite intensive medical treatment, the patient died. Autopsy findings revealed the presence of anasacra and ascites, hydropericardium, cerebral edema, orange staining of internal organs, and cirrhosis of the liver. Histopathological examination of liver sections showed complete micro- and medionodular cirrhotic changes, focal central necrosis of hepatocytes and cholestasis. The copper content in the liver was 89.8 µg/g (normal: 3.58 +/- 1.71 µg/g). CONCLUSIONS: Determination of the copper content in tissues is essential for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in life or after death (in life it can be helpful to make the correct diagnosis, and after death it allows one to establish the cause of sudden death ). The copper level in the liver in Wilson's disease is about 25 times higher than in the healthy liver.",,"Lech, T.;Hydzik, P.;Kosowski, B.",2007,Sep,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15563650701502535,0,0,
367,Cause of death in Wilson's disease,"Before 1948, all patients with Wilson's disease died shortly after diagnosis. In 1948, BAL (dimercaprol) was introduced as a possible effective treatment, followed by penicillamine (1955), zinc salts (1961), trientine (1969), liver transplantation (1982), and tetrathiomolybdate (1984). Despite this broad spectrum of therapeutic options, patients are still dying. This article examines the cause of death in 67 patients (33 males, 34 females) out of a series of 300 seen between 1948 and 2000. Patients were classified according to their presentation as neurological, 32 patients, hepatic 11, mixed hepatic/neurological 10, hemolytic, 6, and ""sibling biopsy"" 8. Diagnostic failure was the main cause of death, but there were several other causes, the main one being bad Compliance and development of malignancy after 10 years of follow-up.

368,Sequential MRI changes in Wilson's disease with decopper therapy: a study of 50 patients,"Wilson's disease (WD) is clinically and radiologically a dynamic disease. However, there are few studies of sequential MRI changes in this disease with or without therapy. This study examined serial MRI changes and their clinical correlates in patients with MM based on change in signal intensity of focal lesions and atrophy. Details of clinical manifestations, Schwab and England activities of daily living (MSEADL) score, neurological symptom score (NSS) and Chu staging were recorded. Clinical severity and disability scores were correlated to MRI scores using SPSS v10. The mean age at onset and diagnosis was 12.8 +/- 5.6 years and 14.4 +/- 6.0 years, respectively. At the time of the first MRI, the patients had been treated for 49.0 +/- 77.3 months. With a follow-up period of 24.2 +/- 12.2 months, the clinical situation had improved in 36 patients, 9 remained the same and 5 had deteriorated. Serial imaging showed improvement in MRI parameters in 35 patients, no significant changes in 10, worsening in 4, and a mixture of resolving and evolving changes in 1. Total MRI score improved from 8.2 +/- 5.7 to 5.9 +/- 6.6. There was an overall improvement in disability and impairment measures: Chu stage, 11.5 +/- 0.7 to 1.3 +/- 0.6; MSEADL Score (%), 79.7 +/- 27.6 to 88.0 +/- 25.4; NSS, 10.6 +/- 11.2 to 8.0 +/- 11.6, with good clinical-radiological correlation. Patients with extensive changes, white matter involvement, and severe diffuse atrophy had a poor prognosis.

369,"Validated, stability-related quantitative purity test for triethylenetetraminetetrachlorohydrate by automated multiple development","There is a monograph of triethylenetetramine dichlorohydrate (Trientine) in the United States Pharmacopeia. But neither the base nor the salts di- or tetrachlorohydrate are included in the European Pharmacopoeia. Triethylenetetramine tetrachlorohydrate, now used as a reagent by AGEPS, is more soluble than triethylenetetramine dichlorohydrate. It is given to patients with Wilson's disease resulting from a congenital deficiency in copper metabolism. A quantitative purity test of this drug by automated multiple development high performance thin layer chromatography is being developed and validated. The tested validation parameters are characterized in particular by retention factor, linearity, detection and quantification limits of several nanograms, reliability and accuracy. The monograph of triethylenetetramine dichlorohydrate in the American Pharmacopeia is examined to determine impurities. This classic development tank process requires two mobile phases and is not quantitative. High performance liquid chromatography assays using a different column and mobile phase did not give good results for removing impurities. A comparative validation of the removal of impurities is therefore not possible.

371,"Hereditary iron and copper deposits: diagnostics, pathogenesis and therapy","Hereditary deposition of iron (primary hemochromatosis) or copper (Wilson's disease) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by progressive liver pathology and subsequent involvement of various other organs. The prevalence of primary hemochromatosis is about 0.5%, about 200 times higher than the prevalence of Wilson's disease. The two diseases are characterized by the homozygous occurrence of mutations in the HFE gene on chromosome 6 (primary hemochromatosis) and in the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13 (Wilson's disease). Unlike most other hereditary diseases, these diseases can be successfully treated, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis. Serum ferritin levels, transferrin saturation and genetic analyzes are used to diagnose hemochromatosis. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease depends on the use of urinary copper levels, serum ceruloplasmin, and a liver biopsy. Left untreated, both genetic diseases lead to rapidly progressive multi-organ damage and early death. The key treatment for hemochromatosis is phlebotomy, for Wilson's disease chelation or Zn treatment. Although current treatments significantly improve patient prognosis, they may be inadequate in patients diagnosed so late that extensive metal deposits have formed in the body. The main research needs in this area are to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms of disease progression and to develop new chelators that are more effective and less toxic than those currently available.

372,Wilson's disease in children: serum aminotransferases and urinary copper on treatment with triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (trientine).,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and adherence to trientine and/or zinc therapy in children with Wilson's disease (WD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1998 and 2006, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of all children with WM in our institution's pediatric liver/liver transplant program. RESULTS: A total of 22 children with WM were examined and treated. Seven with fulminant disease required liver transplantation and 15 were treated with trientine and/or zinc. Ten of these 15 were followed for 12 to 60 months and 6 of the last 10 were followed for 12 to 18 months. All 10 patients were initiated on a trientine regimen. Mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels decreased from 183 +/- 103 IU at presentation (n=10) to 80 +/- 46 IU at 12 months (n=10) and 66 +/- 40 IU at 18 months (n = 7). Mean 24-hour urinary copper levels increased from 156 micrograms at presentation to 494 micrograms at 1 to 2 months and then fell to 71 micrograms at 21 to 24 months of treatment. Three of 10 patients had normalized ALT levels since presentation and 1 patient with cirrhosis continued to have normal ALT levels. Four of 10 patients were documented as nonadherent, manifested by elevated ALT levels (99 +/- 31 IU); 1 patient had previously normalized ALT levels. In 3 out of 10 patients, ALT levels decreased but remained at abnormal levels (93 +/- 53 IU). CONCLUSIONS: Trientine and/or zinc therapy is effective in children with WM.

We have re-evaluated this test. Ninety-eight topics were examined at the presentation. METHODS: Thirty-eight (19 girls, 19 boys; mean age 10.3 years; range 5-16 years) had a definitive diagnosis of WM. Sixty (24 girls, 36 boys; mean age 10.1, range 2.3-15 years) had other liver disease. Urinary Cu was estimated for 24 h before (basal Cu) and for 24 h during administration of penicillamine 500 mg orally every 12 hours x 2 (post-penicillamine Cu). RESULTS: Both basal Cu and post-penicillamine Cu differed significantly between WM patients and controls (basal Cu: median 6.5 micromol/24 h, range 0.9-109 micromol/24 h, versus median: 0, 8 micromoles/24 h, range 0.1-19.5). , p<0.0001; Post-penicillamine Cu: median 36.9 micromoles/24 h, range 1.98-219 micromoles/24 h, versus median 12.35 micromoles/24 h, range 0.5-49.8 micromoles/24 h, p< 0.0001). Post-penicillamine Cu > 25 micromol/24 h was observed in 29/38 patients with WD and in 4/60 controls. 25/38 WM patients were symptomatic. Of these, 23 and 6/13 asymptomatic siblings tested positive. The test had a sensitivity of 76% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.8-88.6%) and a specificity of 93% (95% CI, 83.8-98.2%). Sensitivity was better in symptomatic patients (92%, [95% CI; 74-99%]) than in asymptomatic patients (46%, [95% CI; 19.2-74.9%]).

We conducted the current study to present the phenotypic characteristics and follow-up for a large cohort of patients with WM. We reviewed the medical records of 282 cases of WD (male:female ratio, 196:86) for clinical features, examination, treatment, and outcome data. The clinical presentations were as follows: hepatic, 42 (14.9%); hepato-neurological, 10 (3.5%); neurological, 195 (69.1%); purely psychiatric, 7 (2.4%); osseomuscular, 6 (2.1%); and ""pre-symptomatic"" 15 (5.3%). The mean age was 15.9 years. Presymptomatic patients and those with the hepatic form of WD were younger, and patients with osseomuscular and psychiatric forms were older than neurological patients. The mean disease duration at the time of diagnosis was 28 months. The predominant neurological features were as follows: parkinsonism, 62.3%; dystonia, 35.4%; cerebellum, 28%; pyramidal sign, 16%; chorea, 9%; athetosis, 2.2%; myoclonus, 3.4%; and behavioral problems, 16%. Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings were seen as follows: neurological patients, 100%; liver patients, 86%; and pre-symptomatic patients, 59%.

376,Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation in childhood,"The diagnosis of childhood Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation using clinical and standard laboratory parameters is still challenging and often overlooked or delayed. The aim of the study was to document the clinical and laboratory parameters of hepatic presentation of Wilson's disease in children. The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in a developing country. Clinical and general laboratory parameters were recorded in 32 children with Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation. The diagnosis was based on a positive family history, a Kayser-Fleischer ring, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, increased basal urinary copper excretion, and a favorable response to D-penicillamine therapy. Mean age +/-SD at presentation was 9+/-2.97 years and 21 (65.6%) were boys. Chronic liver disease (21; 65.6%) followed by fulminant liver failure 1 (6; 18.8%) were the most common symptoms. In the group as a whole, a Kayser-Fleischer ring was found in 21 (65.6%) children, a low serum ceruloplasmin in 16 (50%) and an increased basal urinary copper excretion in all 32 (100%) children. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made at presentation on the basis of i) Kayser-Fleischer ring, low serum ceruloplasmin, increased basal urinary copper excretion and positive response to D-penicillamine therapy in 11 (34.4%), ii) Kayser-Fleischer ring, increased basal urinary copper excretion and favorable response to D-penicillamine therapy in 10 (31.2%), iii) increased basal urinary copper excretion and favorable response to D-penicillamine therapy in 6 ( 18.8%) and iv) low ceruloplasmin, increased basal urinary excretion of copper, and favorable response to D-penicillamine therapy in 5 (15.6%) children.

377,Discontinuation of penicillamine in the absence of alternative orphan drugs (trientine zinc): A case of decompensated cirrhosis in Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVES: Report a case of early decompensated liver cirrhosis after discontinuation of penicillamine therapy in a patient with Wilson's disease. CASE SUMMARY: A 33-year-old Chinese female patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease and was prescribed penicillamine 250 mg po once daily. However, the patient developed intolerance and penicillamine was discontinued with no alternative treatment. Five months later she developed decompensated liver cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy. Eventually, the patient died from complications of sepsis and decompensated liver failure. DISCUSSION: Chelating agents are the mainstay of treatment for Wilson's disease, an inherited disorder of hepatic copper metabolism. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, therapy must be initiated and continued lifelong. Interrupting therapy can be fatal or cause an irreversible relapse. Orally administered penicillamine is the chelating agent of first choice. However, its unfavorable side effect profile leads to discontinuation of therapy in 20-30% of patients. In most case reports, discontinuation of penicillamine without replacement treatment results in rapid progression to fulminant hepatitis, which is fatal if liver transplantation is not performed. CONCLUSION: Here we highlight a case of penicillamine withdrawal in a patient with Wilson's disease without substitution of an alternative regimen. This was caused by the unavailability of alternative active ingredients such as trientine in our country. Consequently, the patient progressed to decompensated liver cirrhosis with encephalopathy and eventually died within 5 months. A recent study supports a combination of trientine and zinc in the treatment of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. This combination is able to reverse liver failure and prevent the need for a liver transplant. Both trientine and zinc are not registered in Malaysia. Therefore, liver transplantation was probably the only treatment option for this patient. Therefore, the unavailability of orphan medicinal products in clinical practice is certainly a matter of serious concern.

The diagnosis is easily missed, but if caught early, effective treatments are available that prevent or reverse many manifestations of this disorder. Studies have identified copper's role in disease pathogenesis and clinical, biochemical, and genetic markers that may be useful in diagnosis.

382,"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and long-term outcomes of Wilson's disease: a cohort study","BACKGROUND: Wilson disease is a rare congenital disorder associated with copper accumulation that leads to liver cirrhosis and neurobehavioral deterioration. Clinical data on larger cohorts are limited due to the low morbidity. AIM AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 163 patients with Wilson's disease examined at Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany, to determine clinical presentation, diagnostic course, and long-term outcome. RESULTS: Diagnostic criteria for serum copper not bound to ceruloplasmin, serum ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, liver copper content, presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and histological signs of chronic liver damage were met in 86.6%, 88.2%, 87, 1 reached %, 92.7%, 66.3% and 73% of patients, respectively. Analysis of the ATP7B coding region (excluding exons 2, 3 and 21) revealed disease-causing mutations on both chromosomes and on one chromosome in 57% and 29% of Wilson's disease patients, respectively. No mutations were found in 15% of patients with Wilson's disease. No significant differences in clinical parameters or initial presentation were found between patients grouped by their mutations. Patients with neurological symptoms were significantly older than patients with hepatic symptoms at onset of symptoms (20.2 vs. 15.5 years old, p<0.05), and neurological symptoms were associated with a significantly longer time from onset to Diagnosis associated as hepatic symptoms (44.4 vs. 14.4 months, p<0.05). After the start of treatment, 76.1% of the patients had a stable or improved course of the disease. Disease progression with treatment was more likely for neuropsychiatric symptoms than for hepatic symptoms. Side effects of the treatment occurred in 74.4% of the patients.

383,Optimizing seizure therapy in patients with renal or hepatic impairment,"Patients with epilepsy may have kidney or liver disease that interferes with their antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. In addition, such diseases can themselves cause seizures. Reduced renal function and hypoalbuminaemia lead to accumulation of renally excreted antiepileptic drugs such as gabapentin, vigabatrin, topiramate, levetiracetam and phenytoin. Valproate, lamotrigine, and benzodiazepines are less affected. Low protein-binding AEDs are largely removed by hemodialysis, and additional doses are required for dialysis patients. Uremia and related disorders, including intracranial hemorrhage, glucose and electrolyte imbalances, and concomitant drug use can cause seizures, as can dialysis encephalopathy, primary cerebral lymphoma, fungal infections, and immunosuppressive toxicity in kidney transplant recipients. Hepatic dysfunction reduces the enzymatic metabolism of AEDs and causes hypoalbuminemia. Gabapentin, topiramate, and levetiracetam are preferred in these disorders, while valproate and felbamate are potentially hepatotoxic and should be avoided. Seizures associated with hepatic encephalopathy are controlled with oral lactulose or neomycin. Porphyria patients may benefit from gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or levetiracetam. Seizures in Wilson's disease may result from D-penicillamine-induced pyridoxine deficiency. Effective treatment of seizures in renal and hepatic disease requires attention to changes in AED pharmacokinetics and appropriate management of underlying disorders. Monitoring free drug levels is a valuable therapeutic aid. [References: 41]",,"Lacerda, G.;Krummel, T.;Sabourdy, C.;Ryvlin, P.;Hirsch, E.",2006,2026-12-01 00:00:00,,0,0,

385,Diagnosis and management of Wilson's disease: results of a single center experience,"OBJECTIVES: To report on the diagnostic features, management and clinical outcome after various treatments in patients with Wilson's disease followed for a mean period of 15 years. PATIENTS: 35 patients with Wilson's disease referred to the Department of Gastroenterology of the University of Padua for diagnosis or treatment were followed for an average of 15 years. Diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests (ceruloplasmin, copper concentrations in urine and liver) and uptake of the radiostable isotope Cu into the plasma protein pool. The hepatic Cu content was measured by regular follow-up biopsies. The neurological outcome after therapy was evaluated using a newly developed scoring system. RESULTS: Twenty-three (65.7%) patients with liver disease; 12 (34.3%) had mixed neurological and hepatic involvement. All patients were initially treated with either penicillamine (23) or zinc sulfate (12). Neurological symptoms worsened or persisted in 75% of patients treated with penicillamine, while zinc treatment improved these symptoms in 90% of treated cases. Both treatments were effective in improving hepatic symptoms. There were no differences in liver Cu content between follow-up biopsies in either treatment group. Six patients (26%) had to discontinue penicillamine treatment due to side effects.

390,Wilson's disease: an update,"Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the copper-transporting gene ATP7B. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is characterized by excessive copper deposition, predominantly in the liver and brain. The diagnosis of the condition depends mainly on clinical features, biochemical parameters and the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring, and a new diagnostic scoring system has recently been proposed. Mutations in ATP7B can occur anywhere along the entire 21 exons, making identifying gene defects particularly difficult. Identification of carriers and pre-symptomatic family members of affected individuals is performed using marker analysis based on polymerase chain reactions. Traditional treatment for WD is based on copper chelation with agents such as D-penicillamine, but the use of this drug has been questioned because of reported side effects. The use of agents such as trientine and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate has been advocated, although the results of long-term studies are awaited. In selected cases, orthotropic liver transplantation can reverse the underlying metabolic abnormality in WM and improve both hepatic and neurological symptoms. Studies of the underlying defects in ATP7B and its putative modifiers ATOX1 and COMMD1 should unveil the genotype-phenotype correlation of the disease and lead to the development of improved drugs to alleviate patients' suffering.

391,Resolution of decompensated cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease with zinc monotherapy: a possible therapeutic option?,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wilson disease is a genetic autosomal recessive copper deposition disorder often associated with neurological or hepatic symptoms. For hepatic presentation, treatment is usually initiated with potentially toxic copper chelators such as D-penicillamine or trientine. Although several studies have established zinc as a low-toxicity and inexpensive treatment for Wilson's disease, its use has been limited to adjunctive or sole maintenance options. In this report we describe the use of zinc monotherapy in a patient with severe hepatic presentation of Wilson's disease. METHODS: Zinc has not been evaluated as a single agent treatment option for active hepatic Wilson's disease. A single patient with fulminant liver failure caused by Wilson's disease was initiated on zinc monotherapy while awaiting liver transplantation. RESULTS: Over a period of 1 year on zinc monotherapy, this patient experienced normalization of hepatic synthetic function and resolution of hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy. A clinical stabilization of variceal bleeding, ascites and edema of the lower extremities was also observed. The patient is no longer a transplant candidate due to clinical recovery and improvement in the Model for End-stage Liver Disease and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores. CONCLUSIONS: This case underscores the potential use of zinc as a low-toxic and inexpensive monotherapy in severely decompensated hepatic Wilson's disease. Despite promising results in this case, further clinical investigations are needed to fully assess the clinical efficacy of zinc monotherapy.",,"Lee, V. D.;Northup, P. G.;Berg, C.

392,MR imaging of the brain in childhood Wilson's disease: pre- and post-treatment findings with clinical correlation,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the findings of brain MRI imaging in adult Wilson's disease have been described in great detail, there is currently little information on the findings of brain MRI imaging in pediatric Wilson's disease. The purpose of this study was to analyze the findings of brain MRI imaging in childhood Wilson's disease in the early stages and during post-treatment follow-up and to correlate these observations with clinical response. METHODS: We studied 50 patients with pediatric Wilson's disease. 50 initial and 20 follow-up MRI images from 15 patients after penicillamine treatment were retrospectively analyzed and the data correlated with clinical findings. RESULTS: The patients were divided into 3 groups based on the initial MR imaging findings. Group I (n=23) had normal MR imaging findings. Group II (n=15) was characterized by T1-weighted images with increased signal intensity in the globus pallidus (n=15, 100%), followed by the putamen, midbrain, and caudate nucleus. Group III (n=12) showed T2-weighted images with increased signal intensity in the putamen (n=10, 83%), followed by the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, thalamus, midbrain, and pons. There was a significant difference in mean age, presence of neurological symptoms, and Child-Pugh classification between the 3 groups (p<0.001). After copper chelation therapy, changes in follow-up MR imaging correlated strongly with clinical response to treatment (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Brain MR imaging in children with Wilson's disease can be divided into different groups and showed a significant correlation with clinical findings. MRI follow-up interval changes also correlated closely with clinical findings and were helpful in assessing clinical response.",,"Kim, T. J.;Kim, I. O.;Kim, W. S.;Cheon, J. E.;Moon, S. G.;Kwon, J.

393,"A novel hepatocytic isoform of PLZF lacking the BTB domain interacts with ATP7B, the Wilson disease protein, and positively regulates ERK signaling","The promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein has been described as a transcriptional repressor of the BTB domain/zinc finger family and has been shown to regulate expression of Hox genes during embryogenesis and expression of cyclin A in cell cycle progression. Here, a 45 kDa isoform of PLZF lacking a BTB domain was identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen using the C-terminal region of ATP7B as decoy in our determination of the biological role of the Wilson disease protein outside of its copper-binding domain identified . Our immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the hepatocytic isoform of PLZF could specifically interact with the C-terminal region of ATP7B. Immunostaining of HepG2 cells showed that the ATP7B and PLZF proteins were apparently colocalized in the trans Golgi complexes. It was also found that disruption of PLZF expression in HepG2 cells affected attenuation of ERK activity in a dose-dependent manner. ERK kinase hepatocytic activities were found to be enhanced as a result of PLZF or ATP7B expression, but this enhancement was abolished by deletion of the C-terminal region of ATP7B. Furthermore, a transgenic Drosophila strain ectopically expressing the hepatocytic deltaBTB-PLZF showed phenotypic changes in eye and wing development, and these changes were fully recovered as a result of ATP7B expression, suggesting the apparent in vivo interaction between the both proteins. These PLZF-induced abnormalities were attributed to enhancement of ERK signaling as demonstrated by phenotypic reversions with loss-of-function mutations in ERK signaling in Drosophila. These data suggest the existence of a mechanism that regulates ERK signaling via the C-terminus of ATP7B and the ATP7B-interacting hepatocytic PLZF. Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Ko, J.

394,Erythrocyte metabolism and antioxidant status in Wilson's disease patients with hemolytic anemia,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to the defect in the ATP7B gene characterized by excessive accumulation of copper in the liver with progressive liver damage and subsequent redistribution to various extrahepatic tissues including the brain, kidneys and cornea is. Notably, total serum copper is always low in WD, although non-ceruloplasmin copper may still be high. To assess the role of non-ceruloplasmin copper-catalyzed free radical reactions, we examined erythrocyte metabolism and oxidative stress as mechanisms for hemolysis in eight WM patients during episodes of acute hemolysis and compared them to eight subsequent cases of WM on d-penicillamine therapy and eight healthy children of the same age. Elevated levels of non-ceruloplasmin copper have been found in all WM patients during an episode of hemolytic anemia. There was a marked inhibition of erythrocyte enzymes, namely hexokinase, total adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) in WM patients compared to patients on penicillamine and healthy children, indicating an altered Erythrocyte metabolism during treatment indicates a hemolytic crisis. Antioxidant status has also been found to be impaired as evidenced by decreased glutathione (GSH) levels, decreased antioxidant enzymes (namely superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase), increased lipid peroxidation and impaired plasma antioxidants. Uric acid showed a maximum decrease, followed by ascorbic acid. These results suggest that free radical production from elevated non-ceruloplasmin copper leads to oxidative damage through transition-metal-catalyzed reactions, resulting in altered erythrocyte metabolism and severely impaired antioxidant status in WM patients during hemolytic anemia.",,"Attri, S.;Sharma, N.;Jahagirdar, S.;Thapa, B.

397,Paradigm shift in the treatment of Wilson's disease: Zinc therapy is now the drug of choice,"Zinc therapy has replaced penicillamine as first-line therapy for Wilson's disease. New guidelines reflect the paradigm shift in treatment that has taken place in recent years. In the old paradigm, Wilson's disease was viewed as a genetic disorder associated with accumulation of copper in the liver and other organs after the liver became overloaded with copper. If left untreated, the disease was considered fatal. The old treatment guidelines advised ""decoppering"" with penicillamine as this chelating agent was considered effective in restoring the health of most patients. Before starting treatment, patients were warned that their symptoms could worsen during the first few weeks or months of therapy to avoid disconcerting discontinuation of penicillamine therapy. In the new paradigm, Wilson's disease is viewed as an inherited disorder associated with copper poisoning. The essence of symptomatic Wilson's disease is poisoning by free copper in the blood, that is, by copper not bound to ceruloplasmin. This form of copper is toxic, while accumulated copper and copper bound to ceruloplasmin or metallothionein is not. Treatment of symptomatic Wilson's disease is no longer aimed at ""decoppering"", the removal of accumulated copper, but at normalizing the free copper concentration in the blood in order to reverse copper poisoning. This can be safely and effectively achieved with zinc therapy. Zinc induces metallothionein, a powerful detoxification protein that binds copper. Oral zinc therapy leads to storage of metallothionein-bound copper in the intestinal mucosa and excretion of copper in the stool. New treatment guidelines discourage the use of chelating agents as first-line treatment because they can exacerbate copper poisoning and cause iatrogenic deterioration.",,"Hoogenraad, T.

This paper gives a systematic overview of the different types and stages of presentation of Wilson's disease and gives an opinion on the appropriate therapy in each case. For patients with neurological diseases, the use of tetrathiomolybdate is optimal; for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, a combination of trientine (Syprin, Merck) and zinc is recommended, while in patients with severe hepatic impairment, liver transplantation is required; Zinc therapy alone or trientine alone as a second line is recommended for patients with hepatitis or cirrhosis without hepatic failure, for maintenance therapy, for treating pre-symptomatic patients, and for treating pediatric and pregnant patients.

Laboratory tests revealed a marked increase in serum bilirubin, while aminotransferases were only slightly elevated and alkaline phosphatase was unexpectedly low. Prothrombin and antithrombin III levels were low. There was Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. Ceruloplasmin was lower than normal. Based on these findings, acute Wilson's disease was suspected. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient was immediately transferred to a hepatology center with a transplant facility. There, an increased copper excretion in the urine and an increased copper concentration in the liver tissue were found. Liver histology showed fibrosis but no cirrhosis.

This study evaluated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of creating copper deficiency in human glioblastoma multiforme. Forty eligible patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme began radiotherapy (6000 cGy in 30 fractions) in conjunction with a low-copper diet and escalating doses of penicillamine. Serum copper was measured at baseline and monthly. The primary endpoint of this study was overall survival compared to historical controls in the NABTT CNS Consortium database. The 25 men and 15 women included in the study had a mean age of 54 years and a mean Karnofsky performance status of 90. Surgical resection was performed in 83% of these patients.

413,Inhibition kinetics of fungal tyrosinase by copper-chelating ammonium tetrathiomolybdate,"Using a strategy of chelating copper at the tyrosinase active site to detect a potent inhibitor, several copper-specific chelating agents were applied in this study. Among them, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATTM), which is well-known as a drug used to treat Wilson's disease, proved to be a significant tyrosinase inhibitor. Treatment with ATTM on fungal tyrosinase completely inactivated the enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. Progress-of-substrate reaction kinetics using the two-step kinetic pathway and dilution of the ATTM demonstrated that ATTM is a tight-binding inhibitor and a high dose of ATTM irreversibly inactivates tyrosinase. Advancement of the substrate reaction kinetics and restoration of activity with a dilution of the ATTM revealed that the copper-chelating ATTM can slowly but reversibly bind to the active site without competing with the substrate, and the enzyme-ATTM complex subsequently undergoes a reversible conformational change , resulting in complete inactivation of tyrosinase activity. Thus, inhibition of tyrosinase by ATTM could be categorized as a complexing inhibition with slow and reversible binding.

414,Abnormal deposition of collagen around hepatocytes in Wilson's disease is associated with hepatocyte-specific expression of lysyl oxidase and lysyl oxidase-like protein-2,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lysyl oxidases catalyze the oxidation of lysine residues in collagen and elastin, thereby promoting their polymerization. Here we examined the expression of four lysyl oxidases in normal and diseased human liver. Methods: The expression of the various lysyl oxidases in paraffin-embedded liver slices was analyzed using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The enzymatic activity of lysyl oxidase such as protein-2 (Loxl2 or LOR-1) using a previously described lysyl oxidase assay. RESULTS: We found that the four lysyl oxidases we examined are not significantly expressed in normal liver. In contrast, patients with Wilson's disease and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) express lysyl oxidase (Lox) and lysyl oxidase-like protein-2 (Loxl2 or LOR-1) in hepatocytes, and the expression is accompanied by collagen deposition around the hepatocytes. Lysyl oxidases are also expressed in other fibrotic liver diseases such as hepatitis B and C, but in these diseases expression is restricted to the fibrotic lesions and collagen does not accumulate around hepatocytes. We found that Loxl2 can oxidize lysine residues of collagen and behaves similarly to Lox in this respect. The copper chelator D-penicillamine inhibits Lox12-induced collagen oxidation, but the Lox inhibitor beta-aminopropionitrile did not inhibit oxidation when using a BAPN concentration at which Lox activity was completely inhibited. Loxl2 also catalyzed the oxidation of cell surface proteins on HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells and inhibited their proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of Lox and Loxl2 in hepatocytes from Wilson's disease and PBC patients may contribute to liver damage through several mechanisms. The upregulation of Lox and Loxl2 in Wilson's disease could perhaps be used for diagnostic purposes, since their expression in hepatocytes is already upregulated before the onset of fibrosis.",,"Vadasz, Z.;Kessler, O.;Akiri, G.;Gengrinovitch, S.;Kagan, H.

415,Prognostic factors in patients with severe neurological forms of Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD), a metabolic disorder, is thought to be potentially reversible, even in its severe form. However, some patients do not respond to treatment. AIM: To analyze prognostic factors in severe WD. DESIGN: Retrospective review. METHODS: A total of 140 patients were followed up regularly from February 2002 to May 2004. Twenty-nine (18 males, 11 females) had severe disease as defined by the Modified Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Score (MSEADL) of < or= 50% or Chu stage 3. We analyzed their clinical, laboratory, and MRI Features in terms of prognosis. RESULTS: In the severe form, the mean age at symptom onset was 11.5 +/- 6.4 years and at diagnosis 13.3 +/- 7.0 years. Mean neurological symptom score (NSS), Chu stage, and MSEADL were 26.5 +/- 8.2, 2.7 +/- 0.5, and 24.8 +/- 17.4, respectively. Twenty-one patients underwent MRI; 14 had a repeat MRI. After treatment, 14 patients (Group A) experienced progressive deterioration including death in two cases, while 15 patients (Group B) showed sustained clinical improvement. Demographics, clinical and laboratory characteristics, and baseline MRI scores were not significantly different between the two groups. However, diffuse white matter abnormalities were more prominent in Group A. Initial full-dose penicillamine therapy may have contributed to deterioration in four patients. Drug compliance was poor in both groups, but restarting treatment did not benefit patients in Group A. Serial MRI showed lesion regression only in patients with clinical improvement. DISCUSSION: Severe WD remains a therapeutic challenge, with early diagnosis and treatment essential. Specific MRI observations, a ""start low-go slow"" regimen for penicillamine, and compliance may have prognostic significance. In the absence of clinical predictors, genetic attributes need to be examined.",,"Prashanth, L. K.;Taly, A. B.;Sinha, S.;Ravishankar, S.;Arunodaya, G. R.;Vasudev, M. K.;Swamy, H.

Report of three Italian cases with hypospadias and review,"Hypospadias, when the urethra opens on the ventral side of the penis, is a common malformation, occurring in about 3 in every 1,000 male births. It is a complex condition linked to genetic and environmental factors and can be part of genetic syndromes. Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by a distinctive facial phenotype, Hirschsprung disease, microcephaly, and mental retardation. It is caused by mutations in the zinc finger homeobox 1B gene, ZFHX1B (SIP1). To date, 68 deletion/mutation positive cases have been reported. Genitourinary abnormalities are common in MWS. Here we report that hypospadias is a common occurrence in men with this syndrome. In 39 patients for whom this information was available, hypospadias was present in 46% of patients (18/39). In the 3 Italian male cases reported here, hypospadias was always present. MWS should be considered by endocrinologists in patients with hypospadias associated with developmental delays/intellectual retardation, particularly in the presence of a prominent facial phenotype.

418,Copper-lowering therapy with tetrathiomolybdate as an antiangiogenic strategy in cancer,"Tetrathiomolybdate(TM) is a novel anticopper drug being developed for use in Wilson's disease. It works by forming a stable tripartite complex with serum albumin and copper that renders the complexed copper unavailable for cellular uptake. TM is a very effective anticopper and has an excellent safety profile. It has been shown that normal levels of copper are required for optimal angiogenesis. With this in mind, we decided to evaluate TM as an anticancer agent. TM treatment of Her/2neu mice genetically programmed to develop breast cancer completely prevented the development of overt breast cancer, although avascular microscopic clusters of cancer cells were present in the breasts of TM-treated animals. Controls developed grossly visible tumors. TM was able to potently inhibit tumor growth in six other rodent models. In a phase 1/2 clinical trial in advanced and metastatic cancer, the median freedom from progression was 11 months, and some individual results were quite dramatic. Eight phase 2 trials in specific cancers have started. The proposed mechanism of action of TM is inhibition of angiogenic cytokines. In contrast to other current approaches to antiangiogenic therapy that target single agents, we propose that TM inhibits multiple angiogenic cytokines. Part of this effect appears to be due to inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF(K)B), which in turn controls the transcription of many angiogenic and other cytokines. However, there are likely multiple mechanisms, as some angiogenic cytokines appear to have separate mechanisms of copper dependence. Inhibition of multiple angiogenic cytokines gives TM the potential to be a more global inhibitor of angiogenesis. [References: 67]",,"Brewer, G. J.",2005,May,,0,0,
419,Genes and metals: a deadly combination,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism with an estimated prevalence of 1:30,000. The most common presentations of WD are liver disease and neurological disorders. For many years, the diagnosis was based on the results of multiple clinical and biochemical tests, for which multiple limitations were reported. In recent years, the developments of new techniques in genetic and molecular biology have provided useful tools in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. However, the presence of multiple mutations and the fact that most patients are compound heterozygotes means the problem is not fully resolved. Chelating agents and zinc salts have been used extensively in the treatment of WM patients with a favorable outcome, but debate over first-line drugs continues. Liver transplantation is a cure for patients with decompensated liver disease, but its effect on neurological outcome is not yet clear.

422,"Neurologically presents Wilson's disease: epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment","Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation and copper toxicity due to mutations in the ATP7B gene that result in failure of bile copper excretion. It presents clinically primarily as liver disease, psychiatric disease, neurological disease, or a combination thereof. The neurological disorder is a movement disorder with speech disorders, tremors, incoordination and dystonia as common features. The diagnosis of neurological patients is usually straightforward, with Kayser-Fleischer rings and urinary copper above 100 micrograms/day almost always being present. When treating patients with neurological signs, penicillamine should always be avoided because of the high risk of permanent drug-induced additional neurological deterioration. A new drug that we have developed, tetrathiomolybdate, given for 8-16 weeks in combination with zinc, is our first choice for treating these patients. In the absence of tetrathiomolybdate availability, zinc or trientine are the next best choices. [References: 31]",,"Brewer, G. J.",2005,,,0,0,
423,Wilson's Disease in Seventy-Year-Old Siblings: Raising the Bar for Diagnosis,"Wilson disease (WD) usually presents in the first decades of life, although rare patients have later onset. We report the clinical features, diagnostic assessment, and treatment outcome of two 70-year-old siblings studied in a research study of the treatment of neurological WM. The index case was a 72-year-old woman who suffered from progressive neurological disability and then developed subfulminant liver failure. Her sibling was a 70-year-old male with minimal neurological symptoms and a mild depressive disorder. His liver biopsy revealed only steatosis and minimal fibrosis and elevated hepatic copper (671 µg/g liver dry weight). Molecular studies revealed composite heterozygosity for the disease-specific ATP7B mutations E1064A and H1069Q in both patients. Both subjects were treated with trientine and Zn, followed by Zn maintenance therapy. Over the past 5 years, the clinical course has stabilized and improved, although the index case recently died of bronchopneumonia. In conclusion, the advanced age and different clinical presentations of these two subjects with identical ATP7B mutations raise the question of the level of penetrance for these and other ATP7B mutations. Environmental and extragenic factors are key determinants of disease phenotype. We propose that WD should be considered in patients of any age with liver disease, neurological disease, or psychiatric symptoms.",,"Ala, A.;Borjigin, J.;Rochwarger, A.;Schilsky, M.",2005,Mar,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hep.20601,0,0,

425,Novel D-penicillamine-carrying nanoparticles for metal chelation therapy in Alzheimer's and other CNS disorders,"Metal ions accumulate in the brain with age and in several neurodegenerative diseases. Aside from the copper storage disease Wilson's disease, recent attention has focused on the accumulation of zinc, copper and iron in the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the accumulation of iron in Parkinson's disease. In particular, it has been postulated that the parenchymal deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and its interaction with metal ions plays a role in the progression of AD. Therefore, the strategy of lowering brain metal ions and targeting the interaction of Abeta peptide and metal ions by administering chelating agents has value. Our recent finding that nanoparticle delivery systems can cross the blood–brain barrier prompted us to investigate whether chelators delivered conjugated to nanoparticles could reverse metal ion-induced protein precipitation. In the present studies, the Cu(I) chelator D-penicillamine was covalently conjugated to nanoparticles through a disulfide bond or a thioether bond. Nanoparticle-chelator conjugates were stable in aqueous suspension between pH 6 and 8 when stored at 4 °C and did not aggregate when exposed to salts and serum. The release of D-penicillamine from the nanoparticles was achieved using reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (as a model for glutathione). Only nanoparticles treated under reducing conditions that released the conjugated D-penicillamine were able to effectively redissolve copper-Abeta(1-42) aggregates. These results indicate that nanoparticles have the potential to deliver D-penicillamine to the brain to prevent Abeta(1-42) accumulation and reduce metal ion accumulation in other CNS disorders.",,"Cui, Z.;Lockman, P.

426,Elastosis perforans serpiginosa associated with pseudo-pseudoxanthoma elasticum during treatment of Wilson's disease with penicillamine,"BACKGROUND: Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is a reactive perforating dermatosis characterized by the removal of abnormal elastic fibers from the upper dermis through the epidermis. In a few cases, it occurs as a side effect of treatment with D-penicillamine (DPA). The first case of DPA-induced EPS was described in 1972 in a patient being treated for Wilson's disease. Subsequently, skin lesions resembling pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) were observed in patients treated with DPA and reported as pseudo-PXE. CASE REPORT: We report here the clinical, pathologic, and ultrastructural study of 2 new cases of DPA-induced EPS and pseudo-PXE. These patients had been treated for Wilson's disease for 14 and 16 years, respectively. Characteristic abnormal elastic fibers were found on histopathological examination of both EPS and pseudo-PXE skin and confirmed by an ultrastructural study. There was no ABCC6 mutation. DISCUSSION: Penicillamine is able to induce widespread cutaneous and systemic damage to elastic fibers. Our patients show typical features of DPA-induced elastosis presenting as EPS and pseudo-PXE. The ABCC6 mutation is associated with PXE and, as expected, was absent in our pseudo-PXE cases. This elastopathy has been associated in most cases with morphological changes in elastic fibers after prolonged therapy. DPA can disrupt elastin crosslinking by inhibiting the enzyme lysyl oxidase or by forming complexes with the crosslinked precursors, thereby interfering with normal elastic fiber maturation. However, no fatal complication of DPA-induced elastopathy has been reported to date. Improvement of the skin lesions can be expected after discontinuation of the drug.",,"Becuwe, C.;Dalle, S.;Ronger-Savle, S.;Skowron, F.;Balme, B.;Kanitakis, J.;Thomas, L.",2005,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000081487,0,0,
427,"Protection from spontaneous hepatocellular injury by N-benzyl-d-glucaminedithiocarbamate in Long Evans cinnamon rats, an animal model of Wilson's disease","The Long-Evans cinnamon (LEC) rat is a mutant strain that excessively accumulates copper (Cu) in tissues and models the clinical symptoms and biological features of Wilson's disease in humans. We compared the effect of three metal chelators, N-benzyl-d-glucaminedithiocarbamate (BGD), d-penicillamine (D-PEN), and triethylenetetramine (TETA), on biliary and urinary excretion of Cu using LEC rats. The animals were treated ip with each chelating agent (1 mmol/kg body weight) and then the bile and urine samples were collected for 3 h. Since a single treatment with BGD markedly stimulated the biliary excretion of Cu, the protective effect of repeated BGD injection on spontaneous hepatocellular damage was further investigated. Separate groups received two weekly BGD injections from 11 weeks of age and were compared to saline-injected controls. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and bilirubin levels were significantly increased in LEC control rats at 19 weeks of age, and histopathological analysis showed extensive liver damage in these rats. However, repeated BGD injections prevented the rise in serum ALT and bilirubin and blocked the histopathological changes in the liver. Although Cu rapidly accumulated in the liver, kidney, spleen, and serum of control LEC rats during the test period, repeated BGD injection largely prevented these increases. These results demonstrate that BGD treatment is effective in blocking excessive Cu accumulation in LEC rats, which in turn provides protection against spontaneous liver damage.",,"Shimada, H.;Takahashi, M.;Shimada, A.;Okawara, T.;Yasutake, A.;Imamura, Y.;Kiyozumi, M.",2005,2001-01-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2004.06.005,0,0,
428,Recent clinical features of Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation,"BACKGROUND: We conducted this study to assess recent clinical features of Wilson's disease (WD) with hepatic presentation, particularly in relation to age, degree of liver damage, and association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Sixteen patients with hepatic manifestations were diagnosed with WD in the period 1976-2003. We have divided this period into two periods, ""Past"" and ""New"". The diagnosis was based on the presence of Kayser-Fleisher rings, low serum copper levels, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, elevated urinary copper concentrations before or after D-penicillamine challenge, and elevated liver copper concentrations. This retrospective study was conducted at Ehime University Hospital. RESULTS: Four patients, including one sibling pair, had a family history of WD. Four patients had parental consanguinity. Recently, 6 patients were over 40 years old, while no patient was over 40 years old recently. Four patients had neurological manifestations. Ten patients had liver cirrhosis and 5 chronic hepatitis. Two had fatty liver without obesity. All patients in the past period had cirrhosis of the liver. HCC was identified in three cirrhotic patients during follow-up. All patients were treated with either D-penicillamine or trientine chloride or both. However, four patients had to discontinue these drugs because of the side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Recently, the number of patients diagnosed with WM has increased, not only in relation to patients with classic WM, but also in relation to elderly patients or patients with non-cirrhotic liver damage such as fatty liver and chronic hepatitis.

429,Value of an enzymatic assay for the determination of serum ceruloplasmin,"The serum concentration of the copper protein ceruloplasmin is an important diagnostic indicator of Wilson's disease (WD). It is commonly cited that 95% of people with WD have low serum ceruloplasmin levels. Current evidence suggests that normal serum ceruloplasmin levels are more common in patients with WM, particularly those with liver disease, possibly due in part to the routine use of an immunological assay. This assay can indicate normal ceruloplasmin levels when enzymatic activity is lower. The enzymatic activity is the biologically relevant parameter. We compared immunological measurement with enzymatic determination of oxidase activity in patients with hepatic or neurological symptoms of unknown origin in whom WD was considered in the differential diagnosis. Although a strong correlation between ceruloplasmin protein concentration and oxidase activity was observed in controls, this was not the case in these patients. Twelve patients with different types of liver diseases showed a weak correlation between ceruloplasmin protein concentration and oxidase activity. Ten percent of patients with neurological symptoms (n=41) had low ceruloplasmin levels and oxidase activity, and another 8% had normal ceruloplasmin levels associated with low oxidase activity. Although the enzymatic method is preferred due to its biological relevance, ceruloplasmin analysis is not a reliable diagnostic parameter for the diagnosis of WM in patients with liver disease. An important application of the ceruloplasmin oxidase assay is in the follow-up of patients with WM. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity was undetectable in sera from patients with WD undergoing long-term chelation therapy, suggesting an early sign of copper depletion and the need for subsequent monitoring for symptoms of copper deficiency.",,"Macintyre, G.;Gutfreund, K.

431,Copper inhibits the water and glycerol permeability of aquaporin-3,"Aquaporin-3 (AQP3) is an aquaglyceroporin expressed in erythrocytes and several other tissues. Red blood cells, along with kidney and liver, are the primary targets for copper toxicity. Here we report that both water and glycerol permeability of human AQP3 are inhibited by copper. Inhibition is rapid, dose-dependent and reversible. When copper is dissolved in carbonic bicarbonate buffer, our body's natural buffering system, doses in the range of those seen in Wilson's disease and copper poisoning produce marked inhibition. AQP7, another aquaglyceroporin, was insensitive to copper. Three extracellular amino acid residues, Trp128, Ser152 and His241, have been identified as responsible for the effect of copper on AQP3. We have previously shown that Ser152 is involved in the regulation of AQP3 by pH. The fact that Ser152 mediates the regulation of AQP3 by copper may explain the phenomenon of the extreme sensitivity of human erythrocytes to copper at acidic pH. When AQP3 was coexpressed with another AQP, only glycerol but not copper water permeability was inhibited.

We enrolled 24 patients with 3 or fewer primary lesions of pediatric class A or B hepatocellular carcinoma with a diameter of 3 cm or less who had undergone radical treatment with percutaneous ethanol injection or radiofrequency ablation. Trientine hydrochloride was administered orally in a single daily dose of 250 mg to 12 patients before a meal (fasted, Group 1) or in a total daily dose of 750 mg divided into 3 doses in 12 patients (Group 2). This study was a randomized comparative study between groups of 12 weeks duration. We used the particle-induced X-ray emission method to determine the mineral content of liver tissue. Copper and serum mineral levels in urine were also measured and transaminase levels were examined. Copper levels in liver tissue decreased significantly after treatment to 160.1 micrograms/g dry weight compared to the pre-treatment value of 306.8 micrograms/g dry weight (p<0.05). We found no significant difference in iron or zinc levels before and after treatment. Copper levels were significantly reduced in both groups after treatment (p<0.05).

The results were expressed as a percentage of the untreated control. At 24 h, cytotoxicity detected by the NR assay was significantly higher for all copper concentrations than for MTT or TB (p<0.005 at all concentrations). The cytotoxicity detected by MTT was higher than that detected by TB at all concentrations except 200 micromolar (p<0.05 for 50 micromolar, p<0.005 for 100 micromolar, p=0.001 for 150 micromolar). The results at 48 h were similar (NR versus other: p<0.001 MTT versus TB: NS except at 150 micromol where p<0.01). We investigated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in copper-associated hepatocytotoxicity by incubating subconfluent cells with 2('),7(')-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dye plus copper (concentration range: 0-200 microM) for 1-1.5 h. Copper, but not zinc, resulted in significant increases in ROS (p<0.001). In summary, Hep G2 lysosomes appeared to be more susceptible to Cu-mediated damage than mitochondria; the cell membrane was very resistant to damage.",,"Seth, R.;Yang, S.;Choi, S.;Sabean, M.;Roberts, E.

438,Zinc sulfate release and morphology of matrices prepared for individual therapy of Wilson's disease,"Hydrophobic zinc sulphate wax matrices loaded with different active substances were produced for the individual hospital treatment of Wilson's disease. Drug release parameters, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of the samples were analyzed. The release mechanisms from matrices with 75% and 80% w/w zinc sulfate loadings were described with good correlation by the semi-empirical Fikkian diffusion-based release model. Besides the diffusion of zinc sulphate through the pores of the wax matrices, the parallel diffusion of zinc sulphate from the matrix surface is dominant in samples with 83% and 90% w/w drug loading. The combination of SEM and EDS analysis visualizes the morphology of the matrices and the associated composition, thus explaining the differences in the release properties.",,"Nagy, J.;Vajna, M.;Devenyi, L.;Zelko, R.",2004,Apr,,0,0,
439,Molecular screening of the ZFHX1B gene in prenatally diagnosed isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum,"AIM: Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is the most common malformation of the central nervous system and can be associated with intellectual disability. ACC is found in 40% of cases of Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS), a polytopic embryonic defect with distinctive facial features, severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, and postnatal microcephaly as constants. Other manifestations include Hirschsprung disease, cardiac defects, renal abnormalities, and hypospadias. Therefore, among this broad spectrum of malformations recently associated with haploinsufficiency of the zinc finger homeobox 1B gene (ZFHX1B), ACC may be the only trait detectable prenatally. Therefore, we screened a group of 18 fetuses that were terminated due to ACC and performed ZFHX1B gene mutational analysis in six selected cases. METHODS: Diagnosis of agenesis of ACC was performed by prenatal ultrasonography. Screening for ZFHX1B deletions was performed by poly(CA) microsatellite marker studies and real-time semi-quantitative PCR. Mutation analysis was performed by single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. RESULTS: Neither a deletion encompassing the ZFHX1B locus nor a mutation could be detected in any of the six fetuses analyzed. CONCLUSION: ZFHX1B is not a major gene in isolated ACC. However, analysis of MWS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ACC, particularly when facial features suggest the possibility of MWS.

440,Plasma D-penicillamine redox state assessment by laser-induced fluorescence capillary electrophoresis,"D-Penicillamine (D-Pen) is a thiol drug used to treat Wilson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, metal poisoning, and cystinuria. We recently described a new capillary electrophoresis (CE) method for measuring physiological thiols, in which the separation of total plasma homocysteine, cysteine, cysteinylglycine, and glutathione is achieved using the organic base N-methyl-D-glucamine in the running buffer. In this article, we present an improvement of our method that allows a basic separation of the whole plasma D-Pen from the physiological thiols. In addition, reduced, free and protein-bound dosage forms are measured by varying the order of disulfide reduction with tributylphosphine and protein precipitation with 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA). After derivatization with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (5-IAF), the samples are separated and analyzed by laser-induced fluorescence capillary electrophoresis in an uncoated fused silica capillary (57 x 75 microns ID) using a phosphate/borate running buffer, pH 11.4 , measured. Under these conditions, the migration time of the D-Pen is about 7 min and the time required for each analysis is about 10 min.

441,"Zinc for Prostate Disease and Other Conditions: Little Evidence, Much Hype, and a Significant Potential Problem","Dietary supplements and zinc, especially in excess, have received much attention in numerous alternative medicine sources. There is a small amount of medical evidence that zinc can alleviate some mostly rare conditions (like Wilson's disease). However, in prostate diseases such as BPH, large concentrations of zinc are found in the prostate. Excessive intake of zinc, particularly with individual supplements, has the potential to promote the growth of prostate disease from BPH to cancer. In fact, one large study found a significantly higher risk of advanced prostate cancer in men who consumed large amounts of these supplements. High doses of zinc can inhibit the benefits of bisphosphonate drugs, increase testosterone levels, increase cholesterol, lower levels of ""good cholesterol"" or HDL, and promote immune system dysfunction. More research is needed in this area, but in the meantime the time seems ripe to discourage or immediately stop taking larger zinc concentrations for most people until proper research resolves this controversial issue.

Neurological Wilson's disease often manifests as a movement disorder with dystonia, tremor and dysarthria. Psychiatric or behavioral symptoms can also be a feature of Wilson's disease. We describe an atypical neurological presentation in a prepubertal child with minimal liver involvement; in which transient hemiparesis and encephalopathy dominated its initial neurological presentation. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed extensive cortical and subcortical signaling alteration in addition to the classic basal ganglia signaling abnormality seen in Wilson's disease. She was treated with oral tetrathiomolybdate anticopper therapy followed by zinc maintenance therapy. Her clinical condition and brain imaging improved significantly 1 year after starting treatment.

444,Review article: Diagnosis and current therapy of Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper metabolism resulting in liver disease and/or neuropsychiatric disorders. The diagnosis of a neurological disease is easy when the following symptoms are present: Kayser-Fleischer rings, typical neurological symptoms and low serum ceruloplasmin levels. Diagnosis is more complex in patients with liver disease. None of the frequently used parameters alone allows a reliable diagnosis. A combination of different laboratory parameters is necessary to make the diagnosis with certainty. In the future, limited mutational analysis could play an important diagnostic role. Recently, a group of international experts proposed an assessment based on a variety of tests and clinical symptoms. The validity of this score needs to be assessed prospectively. Treatment requires lifelong administration of copper chelators (d-penicillamine, trientine). A commonly used alternative is zinc. None of these treatments have been tested in prospective randomized controlled trials. Liver transplantation is reserved for severe or treatment-resistant cases with advanced liver disease, while experience in refractory neuropsychiatric disorders is limited.

445,Successful pregnancies and abortions in symptomatic and asymptomatic Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: There are few reports on fertility and pregnancy outcome in Wilson's disease (WD) and none from India. The authors of this study discuss various aspects of fertility in 16 women with WM. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data from a large cohort of WD followed up at a tertiary care center. RESULTS: Sixteen patients conceived on 59 occasions with 30 successful pregnancies, 24 spontaneous abortions, 2 medical terminations and 3 stillbirths. WM was diagnosed post-conception in 10 pre-symptomatic patients, while six patients were already treated. Of these 16 patients, 9 had a history of spontaneous miscarriage and 12 had successful pregnancies. None of the clinical features of WD changed during pregnancy, with or without treatment. All 30 babies were full term and born healthy. CONCLUSION: Recurrent miscarriages are particularly common in women with untreated Wilson's disease. However, successful pregnancies and uneventful full deliveries can occur in treated mothers of WM and in undiagnosed, undetected pre-symptomatic patients. Pregnancy does not appear to affect the clinical course of Wilson's disease. Teratogenicity was not observed in the present series with low-dose penicillamine and zinc sulfate.",,"Sinha, S.;Taly, A.

446,The nucleotide-binding domain of the Escherichia coli P-type Zn2+-transporting ATPase bears a glycine motif that may be involved in ATP binding,"In P-type ATPases, the nucleotide-binding (N) domain is in the middle of the sequence, which folds into the phosphorylation (P) domain. The N-domain of ZntA, a Zn2+-translocating P-type ATPase from Escherichia coli, is approximately 13% identical to the N-domain of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. None of the Ca2+ ATPase residues involved in binding ATP are found in ZntA. However, the G503SGIEAQV sequence in the ZntA N-domain resembles the GxGxxG motif that forms part of the ATP-binding site in protein kinases. This motif is also found in the Wilson disease protein where several disease mutations accumulate in it. In the present work, we have generated a number of disease mutational analogues, including ZntA mutants G503S (Gly503-->Ser), G505R and A508F. At low [ATP], these mutant ATPases are poorly phosphorylated. However, the phosphorylation defect of mutants G503S and G505R can be partially (G503S) or fully (G505R) compensated by using a higher [ATP], suggesting that these mutations decrease the affinity for ATP. In all three mutant ATPases, phosphorylation by P(i) has become less sensitive to the presence of ATP, also consistent with the assumption that the Gly503 motif plays a role in ATP binding. To test this hypothesis, we modeled the N-domain of ZntA using the Ca2+-ATPase structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum as a template. In the model, the Gly503 motif and residues Glu470 and His475 are located near the ATP binding site. In conclusion, the mutagenesis data and molecular model are consistent with the idea that the two loops bearing residues Glu470, His475, Gly503, and Gly505 play a role in ATP binding and activation.",,"Okkeri, J.;Laakkonen, L.;Haltia, T.",2004,2001-01-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1042/BJ20030740,0,0,
447,Results of the treatment of Wilson's disease - own observations,"BACKGROUND: A causal treatment of hereditary Wilson's disease (WD) has so far been impossible, although gene therapy may be possible in the future. Today, the principle of treatment consists in excretion, through the kidneys, of the excess of easily mobilizable copper bound by chelating agents, the most important of which is D-penicillamine. It is also possible to block intestinal copper absorption by administering zinc preparations, which also induce hepatic metallothionein synthesis. The aim of our study was to present our own observations and results on the treatment of Wilson's disease. MATERIAL/METHODS: Over the past 16 years we have followed 33 patients aged 13-60 years (mean age 27 years) with various forms of WM. The studied group consisted of 11 women and 21 men who were hospitalized with different diagnoses or presented to the special outpatient clinic for hepatology. In addition to standard laboratory tests, the concentrations of ceruloplasmin, copper in serum and urine and the activity of some hepatic enzymes, proteins and HBV/HCV infection markers were determined. The patients were also examined by a neurologist and an ophthalmologist, with psychiatric advice if necessary. Taking into account the overall clinical picture, the patients were divided into the following groups depending on the form of the disease: fulminant, acute, hepatic, hepatic with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, neuropsychiatric, asymptomatic. RESULTS: All patients were initially treated with D-penicillamine. No side effects were observed with most of them. Treatment was continued according to urinary copper levels (for a maximum of 10 years). After achieving clinical improvement with reduced 24-hour urinary copper excretion, we reduced or even discontinued D-penicillamine doses and introduced zinc supplements. In asymptomatic carriers, zinc preparations were used throughout the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of chelation therapy is associated with a good prognosis in both hepatic and neurological forms of WM. Zinc preparations are effective and safe in neurological and oligosymptomatic forms of the disease.",,"Jablonska-Kaszewska, I.;Drobinska-Jurowiecka, A.;Dabrowska, E.;Trocha, H.",2003,Aug,,0,1,
448,Treatment of Wilson's disease,"Based on the literature research and our own experience, we have presented the treatment method for Wilson's disease. A causal treatment has so far been impossible, although gene therapy may be possible in the future. Nowadays, the principle of treatment consists in eliminating the excess of easily mobilizable copper by means of chelating agents or blocking the absorption of copper in the intestine. The most important is chelation therapy, which aims to mobilize copper from the affected organs and promote its excretion through urine or stool. The main chelating agent is D-penicillamine, which is quite effective but not without some side effects. Alternative chelating agents such as trientine and tetrathiomolybdate have also been used successfully. Zinc salts are also of therapeutic value. They promote copper excretion by inducing the synthesis of metallothionein in the gut, thereby blocking copper absorption from the gut. Zinc salts have almost no side effects. They cannot be used as first line treatment but are very effective for maintenance therapy. Chelation therapy is ineffective in patients with acute liver failure with encephalopathy and hemolysis. In these cases, a liver transplant is the only hope for survival. Liver transplants in patients with dominant psychoneurological symptoms are under discussion.",,"Jablonska-Kaszewska, I.;Dabrowska, E.;Drobinska Jurowiecka, A.;Falkiewicz, B.",2003,Aug,,0,0,
449,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. XVIII. Initial treatment of hepatic decompensation presentation with trientine and zinc,"We have treated 9 patients with hepatic decompensation secondary to Wilson's disease with a combination of trientine and zinc, generally for at least 4 months, followed by a switch to zinc maintenance therapy. All of these patients had hypoalbuminemia, all but 1 had hyperbilirubinemia, and 7 had ascites. All of these patients would have been candidates for liver transplantation based on their initial Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) values. The minimum eligibility criterion for transplant candidates is a score greater than 7. Eight of the 9 patients had demonstrated a CTP score of 10 or greater. The other scoring system used in Wilson disease to determine the need for a transplant is the Nazer Prognostic Index, where a score above 6 indicates the patient is unlikely to survive without a transplant if treated with penicillamine is treated. Two of our patients had Nazer scores greater than 6. With our medical therapy, all 9 of these patients recovered normal liver function, as reflected in the normalization of their CTP scores to 5. Due to co-existing neurological disease, 1 of our 9 patients was initiated on a neurological protocol and randomly assigned to receive tetrathiomolybdate(TM) and zinc after 2 weeks of trientine/zinc treatment. This patient's liver function recovered much faster than the other 8 patients, all treated with trientine/zinc, suggesting that TM therapy offers another benefit. In summary, we were able to enroll 9 patients presenting with liver failure - 8 of whom had CTP scores suggesting a potential need for liver transplantation and 2 of whom had Nazer prognostic scores suggesting they are unlikely to survive would if they were treated with penicillamine alone - and are treating them medically, with recovery in all 9. We believe that trientine/zinc combination therapy should be the standard for initial treatment of liver failure in Wilson's disease because its effectiveness is that of Penicillamine is equal or slightly superior and because it has a much lower incidence of side effects. In addition, TM warrants a study to determine whether treatment for hepatic Wilson's disease can be further improved.",,"Askari, F. K.;Greenson, J.;Dick, R. D.;Johnson, V. D.;Brewer, G.

In this study, we sought to assess tissue levels of glutathione and cysteine, an important detoxification system, and of malondialdehyde, a marker for lipoperoxidation, in patients with Wilson's disease receiving penicillamine or zinc treatment compared to patients with different chronic liver diseases Origin. The concentrations of cysteine, reduced/oxidized glutathione, malondialdehyde, zinc and copper were determined (using high pressure liquid chromatography, fluorimetry and atomic absorption spectrophotometry) in liver biopsy specimens from 24 patients with Wilson's disease (18 treated with zinc, 6 with penicillamine), 34 patients with chronic viral hepatitis and 10 patients with alcoholic liver disease. In patients with Wilson's disease, levels of reduced glutathione were lower than in those with viral hepatitis and the same as in those with alcoholic liver damage. The cysteine level was significantly lower than in the control groups, and the percentage of oxidized glutathione/total glutathione was higher than in a viral or alcoholic disease. Malondialdehyde levels were low, but when patients treated with zinc and penicillamine were considered separately, only the former had low malondialdehyde levels. Patients treated with zinc had higher levels of reduced glutathione and lower percentages of oxidized glutathione. In summary, Wilson's disease patients have relevant glutathione depression with low levels of reduced glutathione and cysteine and high levels of oxidized glutathione: this is prevented by the administration of zinc, which inhibits lipid peroxidation and increases glutathione availability.",,"Farinati, F.;Cardin, R.;D'Inca, R.;Naccarato, R.;Sturniolo, G.

463,Copper chelate antiangiogenic therapy,"As new compounds are evaluated for use in clinical trials of antiangiogenic therapies, two important factors must be considered. Regardless of clinical efficacy, the potential drug must be inexpensive and relatively easy to manufacture. The compound Endostatin (Entremed, Inc.) recently completed two phase I studies with minimal toxicity to the treated patients [1,2]. However, due to the difficulty and cost of producing large quantities of a recombinant protein, Entremed Inc. has run into financial difficulties [3]. As the fate of this company shows, a drug must not only be clinically effective, but also have a reasonable production economy. Another interesting component of compound design is selectivity. Highly selective antiangiogenic compounds such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU-5416 are being replaced by less selective compounds such as SU-6668, which acts on a broader spectrum of tyrosine kinase receptors [4]. This trend towards using less selective antiangiogenic compounds is based on preclinical models showing both better clinical efficacy using less specific molecules and lower response rates for the more selective compounds. With the aim of further investigating broad-spectrum antiangiogenic drugs, the authors are currently evaluating new classes of drugs that preferentially bind copper and inhibit angiogenesis. Copper has been recognized as an important target for antiangiogenic therapy for several years [5]. Recently, through the use of molecular techniques, the target enzymes that use copper as a cofactor have been elucidated.

464,"Tetrathiomolybdate anticopper therapy for Wilson's disease inhibits angiogenesis, fibrosis and inflammation","The need for agents to lower body copper in Wilson's disease, a disease resulting from copper toxicity, was the driving force behind the development of the potent anti-copper drugs penicillamine, trientine, zinc and now tetrathiomolybdate(TM). Due to its rapid effect, potency and safety, TM is proving to be a very effective drug for the initial treatment of acutely ill Wilson's disease patients. In addition, TM has anti-angiogenic effects since many pro-angiogenic cytokines require normal levels of copper. This has led to the use of TM in cancer, where it is generally effective in animal tumor models, and has shown its effectiveness in preliminary clinical studies. Recently, TM was found to have anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects through the inhibition of pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory cytokines. [References: 82]",,"Brewer, G. J.",2003,Jan-Mar,,0,0,

The clinical picture and low serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels gave us a clue to suspect Wilson's disease and to initiate plasmapheresis and D-penicillamine soon after admission. Serum and urine copper levels were elevated with low serum ceruloplasmin. We switched to outpatient follow-up with medical treatment with D-penicillamine.

466,Molecular diagnosis and prophylactic therapy for presymptomatic Chinese patients with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: The potential for treatment of Wilson's disease (WM) underscores the importance of pre-symptomatic diagnosis in families with WM (WM families). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility of pre-symptomatic DNA diagnosis and evaluate the efficacy of zinc sulfate therapy in WM families. METHODS: Seventy-eight clinically unaffected siblings were studied from 51 unrelated WM families identified from affected individuals. Diagnosis in presymptomatic patients was made by a combination of direct mutation analysis and haplotype analysis using 3 short tandem repeat markers. The pre-symptomatic patients were treated with 50 mg elemental zinc sulfate twice daily from the time of molecular diagnosis and followed up for 3 to 5 years. RESULTS: Of the 78 siblings, 17 were diagnosed as pre-symptomatic patients. Kayser-Fleischer rings were absent in 7 and faint in 4 of the 17 pre-symptomatic patients. During zinc therapy, serum ceruloplasmin levels gradually increased and 24-hour urinary copper levels gradually decreased, indicating effective control of copper metabolism. None of the siblings developed clinical symptoms of WM or side effects of zinc therapy.

468,Wilson's disease: the importance of non-immunological measurement of serum ceruloplasmin,"Wilson's disease should be considered as a possible diagnosis in any child, adolescent, or young adult with unexplained liver damage, particularly if hemolysis is present. However, it can also occur in adolescents or young adults with neurological symptoms that are limited to the motor system. The first diagnostic screening test is the determination of the serum ceruloplasmin and the total serum copper concentration with calculation of the serum non-ceruloplasmin-bound (“free”) copper. Serum ceruloplasmin containing copper is best determined by measuring its oxidase activity since the immunonephelometric method measures both ceruloplasmin and the biologically inactive apo form. Diagnosis can be confirmed by increased urinary copper excretion. All close relatives of an identified patient must be examined and if there is any doubt, an examination of the Wilson gene on chromosome 13q14.3 can be performed. Lifelong follow-up is best done at a specialized center. Compliance with chelation therapy (penicillamine or trientine) or administration of the metal antagonist tetrathiomolybdate or zinc is monitored by measuring ""free"" serum copper, which should be maintained at or near 1.6 micromol/L (10 micrograms/100 mL). Side effects of the therapy are recorded by determining total protein in the urine, blood count and blood sedimentation rate, coagulation factors and liver function tests.

Initial therapy in a total of 55 neurologically affected patients and aftercare with zinc therapy,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear which anticopper drug to use for patients with Wilson's disease with neurological manifestations, since penicillamine often neurologically aggravates them and zinc is slow-acting. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of neurological deterioration and adverse drug reactions with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. DESIGN: Open label study of 55 untreated patients (22 of whom were new) with neurological Wilson disease who were treated with tetrathiomolybdate varying between 120 and 410 mg/day for 8 weeks and then followed up for 3 years. Neurological function was assessed using graded neurological and language tests. SETTING: A college hospital referral setting. PATIENTS: All untreated, newly diagnosed patients with neurological Wilson disease. INTERVENTION: Treatment with tetrathiomolybdate. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurologic function was assessed by neurologic and speech assessments. Adverse drug effects were evaluated by complete blood count and biochemical measurements. RESULTS: Only 2 (4%) of 55 patients treated with tetrathiomolybdate experienced neurological deterioration compared to an estimated 50% of patients treated with penicillamine. Five of the 22 new patients had bone marrow suppression and 3 had aminotransferase elevations. These numbers are higher than the original 33 patients and appear to be mainly due to faster dose escalation. CONCLUSIONS: Tetrathiomolybdate shows excellent efficacy in patients with Wilson's disease presenting with neurological manifestations. If the dose is increased rapidly, side effects due to bone marrow suppression or elevated aminotransferases may occur.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Hedera, P.;Kluin, K. J.;Carlson, M.;Askari, F.;Dick, R.

Left untreated, this leads to hepatitis, neurological complications, and death. Long-Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats have a homologous mutation in Wilson's disease and thus provide an animal model. Liver lysosomes from tetrathiomolybdate-treated LEC rats were isolated and analyzed by Cu and Mo K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The lysosomes contained a Cu-Mo-S cluster in which the Mo of four sulfur atoms at 2.24 Å is coordinated with approximately three copper neighbors at 2.70 Å. Each Cu coordinates with 3–4 sulfur atoms at 2.28 Å and approximately one Mo neighbor at 2.70 Å A.

471,[Peripheral nociceptin levels in Wilson's disease],"The plasma level of nociceptin, the endogenous agonist of the orphaninFQ/OP4 receptor, was significantly increased (14.87 +/- 2.44 pg/mL +/- SD, p<0.001, n=21) IM in patients with Wilson's disease Compared to age-matched healthy controls (9.18 +/- 1.63 pg/mL +/- SD, n=25). Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene that leads to toxic accumulation of copper mainly in the liver and brain, and other organs such as the kidney and cornea. Measurements were performed by 125 I radioimmunoassay. Neither gender differences nor a correlation between plasma nociceptin levels and liver function test results have been identified in patients with Wilson's disease. It is hypothesized that a significantly elevated plasma nociceptin level is due to the inhibition of nociceptin-inactivating Zn-metallopeptidases (aminopeptidase N, endopeptidase 24.15) by the toxic copper levels, since it is known that the change in the central Zn atom to Cu resulted in approximately 50% inhibition of the activity of these enzymes.

472,"Transport and detoxification systems for transition metals, heavy metals and metalloids in eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes","Transition metals, heavy metals and semi-metals are usually toxic in excess, but a number of transition metals are essential trace elements. There are mechanisms for metal ion homeostasis in all cells, often involving a balance between uptake and outflow systems. This overview briefly describes ATP-coupled resistance pumps. ZntA and CadA are P-type bacterial ATPases that confer resistance to Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II). Homologous copper pumps include the Menkes and Wilson disease proteins and CopA, an Escherichia coli pump that confers resistance to Cu(I). There are several transporter families for resistance to arsenic and antimony. In E. coli, the ArsAB ATPase is a novel system that confers As(III) and Sb(III) resistance. Eukaryotic arsenic resistance transporters include Acr3p and Ycf1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These systems offer resistance to arsenite [As(III)]. Arsenate [As(V)] detoxification involves the reduction of As(V) to As(III), a process catalyzed by arsenate reductase enzymes. There are three families of arsenate reductases, two are found in bacterial systems and a third has been identified in S. cerevisiae. [References: 43]",,"Rosen, B. P.",2002,Nov,,0,0,
473,Molecular mechanism of copper transport in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The Wilson disease protein is a putative P-type copper-transporting ATPase, ATP7B, whose malfunction leads to the toxic accumulation of copper in the liver and brain, causing the hepatic and/or neurological symptoms that accompany this disease. The cytosolic N-terminal domain (approximately 70 kDa) of this ATPase comprises six heavy metal associated domains, each containing the conserved metal binding motif GMTXXC. The N-terminal domain (Wilson's disease copper binding domain [WCBD]) was expressed, purified and characterized using various techniques. WCBD competitively binds six copper atoms in the +1 oxidation state with greater affinity than any other metal. The copper atom is coordinated by two cysteines in a distorted linear geometry. Copper binds the WCBD in a cooperative manner and induces secondary and tertiary conformational changes. Zinc binding to WCBD has also been characterized by circular dichroism spectroscopy and shown to induce conformational changes entirely different from those induced by copper. The phosphorylation/nucleotide binding domain of ATP7B has also been expressed and characterized and shown to be capable of binding ATP but lacking ATPase activity. A peptide corresponding to the sixth transmembrane domain of ATP7B has been constructed and shown to undergo secondary conformational changes upon binding of a single copper atom. Finally, a chimeric protein consisting of WCBD and truncated ZntA, a zinc-transporting ATPase lacking the N-terminal domain, was constructed and analyzed for metal ion selectivity. These results suggest that the core determines the metal ion specificity of P-type ATPases and the N-terminal metal binding domain may play a regulatory role.

474,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD), a congenital disorder of copper (Cu) metabolism, is one of the leading liver diseases in children in India today. The clinical presentation can be extremely diverse, namely all forms of acute and chronic liver diseases, minimal to severe neurological diseases, psychiatric problems, bone deformities, hemolytic anemia and endocrine manifestations. A high index of suspicion is required along with a reasonable battery of investigations for diagnosis. The hepatic copper estimate is the most reliable test but is not readily available in India. Liver biopsy may not be possible due to bleeding problems, and histological features are often not diagnostic for WD. In the absence of hepatic Cu, low ceruloplasmin, high 24-hour urinary copper, and the presence of KF rings aid in diagnosis. The mainstay of initial therapy are Cu chelators such as D-penicillamine and trientine to reduce body copper to subtoxic levels. Subsequent maintenance therapy is essential for life with D-penicillamine, trientine or zinc. Children on therapy must be regularly monitored for response, side effects, compliance, and rehabilitation. Response to therapy can be unpredictable, but acute and early symptoms such as fulminant liver failure have a poor outcome. All siblings must be screened for WM because early diagnosis and treatment lead to a good outcome. The identification of the WD gene on chromosome 13 has led to the possible use of molecular genetics (haplotype and mutational analyses) in the diagnosis of WD. Parent groups/associations need to be actively involved in holistic management of WM. [References: 35]",,"Pandit, A.;Bavdekar, A.;Bhave, S.",2002,Sep,,0,0,

477,Zinc inhibits nuclear translocation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and protects cultured human neurons from copper-induced neurotoxicity,"High concentrations of the trace metal zinc (Zn) have previously been shown to transiently protect cells from apoptotic death. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this protection are not known. Therefore, this work investigated the ability of Zn to protect human neurons in culture (NT2-N) from Cu-mediated death and tested the hypotheses that the tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a role in Cu-induced neuronal death and is part of its mechanism of Zn protection. Copper toxicity (100 microM) resulted in significant apoptotic neuronal death at 12 h. Addition of 100 microM Zn to Cu-treated cells increased neuronal death. However, the addition of 700 microM Zn to Cu-treated cells resulted in neuronal viability that did not differ from untreated controls over 24 h. Although the p53 mRNA abundance was increased by the addition of Cu and 100 microM Zn, it was reduced to 50% of control by the addition of 500 microM Zn in Cu-treated cells and to 10% of control by 700 microM Zn. Consistent with its role as a transcription factor, both Western analysis and immunocytochemistry revealed significant elevations in p53 nuclear protein levels in Cu toxicity. The role of p53 in Cu-mediated apoptosis was further confirmed by eliminating apoptosis in Cu-treated cells transfected with a dominant-negative p53 construct to prevent p53 expression. Furthermore, the addition of 500-700 microM Zn prevented the movement of p53 into the nucleus, suggesting that Zn not only protects neurons from Cu toxicity by regulating p53 mRNA abundance, but also translocation of p53 prevented in the core.",,"VanLandingham, J.

The derivatives were separated within 20 min on a reversed-phase column with isocratic elution and detected spectrofluorometrically at 480 nm with excitation at 345 nm. This method has been successfully used to monitor TETA in human and rabbit sera with a simple pretreatment.

DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: Bilateral peripheral golden-brown pigment deposits consistent with Kayser-Fleischer rings at the level of Descemet's membrane were observed in an 18-year-old woman. She initially denied systemic symptoms. RESULTS: The patient's serum cerumoplasmin level was normal. Liver function tests were also normal. Further evaluations with 24-hour urine copper assay and liver biopsy were positive for Wilson's disease. She underwent anti-copper therapy and 6 months later reported improved concentration and balance. There was no significant change in the Kayser-Fleischer rings. CONCLUSION: Wilson's disease occurs when a defective copper-transporting enzyme in the liver leads to toxic accumulation of copper in multiple organs. Due to the insidious nature of the disease, patients may not seek medical attention until severe irreversible damage has occurred. By diagnosing Kayser-Fleischer rings, ophthalmologists can play a crucial role in the early detection and proper assessment of such patients.",,"Liu, M.;Cohen, E. J.;Brewer, G. J.;Laibson, P.

The NH(2)-terminal domain (ca. 70 kDa), which contains six copies of the heavy metal-associated repeat GMT/HCXXC, is also able to bind zinc. We used circular dichroism (CD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to characterize zinc binding to the NH(2)-terminal metal-binding domain. These studies have shown that zinc is able to bind to this domain with a 6:1 stoichiometry and upon binding induces conformational changes in the NH(2)-terminal domain. These conformational changes are completely different from those previously observed for copper binding to the domain and result in an overall loss of secondary structure in the domain. The XAS spectra show that zinc is primarily ligated through nitrogen atoms and therefore has low affinity for the heavy metal-associated repeats to which copper has been shown to bind.

All patients were young women (17-23 years), none of whom had a history of liver disease. They were admitted with jaundice, nausea, vomiting and symptoms of increasing haemolysis. The diagnosis WM was made as a disturbed copper metabolism. After a short period of observation, ascites and anasarca appeared, hemorrhagic diathesis and other symptoms of liver failure increased.

Despite treatment with D-penicillamine, plasmapheresis and symptomatic medication, three of the women died in irreversible liver coma because liver transplantation was not possible. The fourth woman was taken to the transplant center where a liver transplant was performed because of worsening symptoms of liver failure. Histopathologically, micronodular cirrhosis was found in all of these cases. The fifth patient survived after undergoing the above treatment without liver transplantation. The main differences between the surviving patients and those who died or underwent transplantation were a relatively higher alkaline phosphatase activity (26 U/L vs. 10-20 U/L), slightly higher levels of coagulation factors, and a prothrombin time that was never falls below 68% of the control group (vs. 14-44% in other patients).

Part 2: ATP7B gene mutations lead to Wilson disease (WD),"Mutations in the Wilson disease gene ATP7B, a P-type ATPase, are responsible for copper accumulation in the liver and other organs leading to Wilson disease (WD, OMIM 277900). Clinical manifestations of Wilson disease (WD) include chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, or neuropsychiatric disorders. With effective medical treatments available to prevent disabling residual symptoms, early diagnosis is crucial. To demonstrate the clinical course and genetic findings, a male patient with a novel mutation in the ATP7B gene, a 10 base pair insertion in exon 6 (1927ins 10) and a second missense mutation in exon 13 (P992L) is reported . The patient showed signs of chronic liver disease at the age of 10 years. Clinical findings included hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, and coagulopathy. Combination treatment with the copper chelating agent D-penicillamine and zinc acetate was started, which resulted in normalization of liver function and no occurrence of neurological symptoms or the Kayser-Fleischer ring after 7 years of follow-up. Truncating mutations of the ATP7B gene (insertions, deletions, nonsense mutations) that result in gross loss of C-terminal portions of the protein, thereby likely destroying protein function entirely, may correlate with a hepatic phenotype and early onset, as in the featured patient observed .",,"Seidel, J.;Caca, K.;Schwab, S.

AIM: The aim is to study the clinical features, biochemical and radiological abnormalities of this disorder in East India and the effect of treatment. RESULTS: 49 (n = 49) cases were studied over a 10-year period. The majority of patients were male with a mean age of onset of 11.13 years. They often present with dysarthria, dystonia, or drooling. The clinical features were dystonia (96%), silly smile (92%), dysarthria (80%), cognitive decline (71%), tremor (47%), bradykinesia (45%), etc. Family history suggested autosomal recessive disease pattern. Sibling screening revealed that 4/8 (50%) were presymptomatic. All but one had a Keyser-Fleischer ring (KF) in their cornea. Serum copper was reduced in 77% of cases, while ceruloplasmin was lower in 94% of cases. The most common abnormalities observed on CT/MRI were the basal ganglia (74%), followed by white matter abnormalities (59%) and brainstem abnormalities (20.5%). Response to treatment was not that good and in 50% of cases there was an initial deterioration. Only five patients were able to return to their school. CONCLUSION: Wilson's disease has protean manifestations. All children with slowly progressive extrapyramidal syndrome should be evaluated. Screening of all asymptomatic siblings for Wilson disease must be performed. In all cases, early initiation of appropriate treatment and lifelong continuation is indicated. In the present series, an earlier age of onset of neurological signs and symptoms was observed; In 50% of cases there was an initial deterioration and the response to treatment was not as good.",,"Sinha, S.;Jha, D.

491,Quercetin cumulatively enhances copper induction of metallothionein in intestinal cells,"Wilson's disease, a genetic condition of copper overload, is currently treated with zinc because of its ability to induce metallothionein. We are interested in nonmetallic chemicals that alter copper metabolism in the gut and may help alleviate copper toxicity. Previously, we showed that quercetin, a dietary flavonoid, can chelate copper. This study further examined the interaction of quercetin and copper in intestinal epithelial cells. We found that quercetin enhanced metallothoinin induction by copper and the effect was dose dependent. Quercetin also exerted a cumulative effect after repeated exposure. Repeated low dose (3-10 micromolar) treatment of cells with quercetin can result in the same effect on metallothoinin as treatment at a higher concentration (100 micromolar). This property of quercetin is distinct from its chemical interaction with copper, but both may help reduce copper toxicity. Among the other flavonoids tested, two other copper chelators, catechin and rutin, did not increase copper induction of metallothionein, while genistein, an isoflavone that does not chemically interact with copper, increased copper induction of metallothionein. The effect of quercetin on copper metabolism is unique. Quercetin reduced zinc-stimulated metallothionein expression and had no effect on cadmium induction of metallothionein. The clinical application of our observation needs to be explored.",,"Kuo, S. M.;Huang, C. T.;Blum, P.;Chang, C.",2001,Winter,https://dx.doi.org/10.1385/BTER:84:1-3:001,0,0,
492,"Copper, iron, magnesium, zinc, calcium, sulfur and phosphorus accumulation in the brain in Wilson's disease","PROJECT: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism characterized by juvenile liver cirrhosis and neurological symptoms. Brain copper levels in WM have been reported to be 10 to 15 times normal, depending on different brain regions. Because very little data is available on the distribution of copper in the central nervous system in WM, it seemed of interest to examine the concentration of copper and other trace elements (Zn, P, Mg, Ca, Fe, and S) in the brain of a deceased patient for WD. PROCEDURE: A 56-year-old woman diagnosed with WM was admitted to our hospital with evidence of liver failure and died a few days later. At autopsy, a brain section spanning from the left to the right hemisphere was divided into 28 samples. Copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, sulfur, zinc and calcium were determined on each sample by induced coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. RESULTS: The mean copper concentration of 88 to 158 micrograms/g dry tissue in all brain samples was higher than the literature reference values, while that of the other elements tested was significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS: 1) In the brain of the examined WM patient, the status of trace elements was greatly altered. Further studies are needed to correlate the concentration of trace elements with pathological lesions and clinical pictures. 2) The elements considered in our study showed an uneven distribution in different brain areas.",,"Faa, G.;Lisci, M.;Caria, M.

493,Iron accumulation in the liver of male patients with Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVES: There is increasing evidence that ceruloplasmin, a copper protein with ferroxidase activity, plays an important role in iron metabolism. As with hemochromatosis, the genetic disorder aceruloplasminemia can lead to iron accumulation in the tissue. Since most patients with Wilson disease, a genetic copper toxicosis, have hypoceruloplasminemia, some may be affected by iron overload. METHODS: Four male patients with Wilson's disease were included in this study on iron metabolism before and after treatment. RESULTS: Before treatment, liver copper levels were high in all four male patients evaluated for diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Genetic analysis supported her clinical diagnosis of Wilson's disease without a background of hemochromatosis. Pre-treatment serum ceruloplasmin levels were < 20 mg/dl in all four patients. Standard penicillamine treatment for 3-8.5 years further reduced their serum ceruloplasmin levels. Post-treatment serum ferroxidase activity was low, as was serum ceruloplasmin protein. Liver copper levels decreased in all subjects after treatment. In contrast, non-heme iron in the liver increased during treatment. Pre-treatment liver samples were positive for histochemical iron in two patients and post-treatment samples were positive in all four patients. In two patients, serum aminotransferase levels rose again during the treatment period with an increase in serum ferritin concentration. Subsequent iron reduction by phlebotomy ameliorated her biochemical liver damage. CONCLUSIONS: Iron overload associated with hypoceruloplasminemia may be clinically significant, particularly in male Wilson's disease patients.",,"Shiono, Y.;Wakusawa, S.;Hayashi, H.;Takikawa, T.;Yano, M.;Okada, T.;Mabuchi, H.;Kono, S.;Miyajima, H.",2001,Nov,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1572-0241.2001.05269.x,0,0,

Dithiomolybdate and trithiomolybdate, which commonly contaminate TTM, inhibited the copper ATPases with similar potency. Inhibition could be reversed by copper or silver, suggesting inhibition by substrate binding. These findings allowed for the first time an estimation of the high affinity of CopB for copper and silver. TTM is a new tool to study copper ATPases.",,"Bissig, K. D.;Voegelin, T.

495,Personality traits in treated Wilson's disease determined using the Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP),"AIM: The aim was to elucidate the personality traits of patients with treated Wilson's disease (WM) compared to healthy subjects. METHOD: Twenty-five WM patients, ten females and 15 males, with a mean age of 35.2 +/- 8.3 years, completed the Karolinska Personality Scales (KSP), a self-reported inventory that includes 15 separate scales. The results were compared to a control series of 200 men and 200 women from the general population. RESULTS: Patients with treated WM performed significantly worse than healthy controls on aggressiveness-hostility-related scales and the scale measuring psychological anxiety. Patients with predominantly hepatic symptoms had the lowest scores for aggressiveness, and patients with predominantly neurological symptoms had the lowest scores for irritability, guilt, and detachment, and the highest scores for impulsivity and muscle tension. Both groups scored low on the somatic anxiety scale. CONCLUSIONS: The present results illustrate that patients with treated WM show significant deviations in personality traits, particularly in relation to aggressiveness-hostility-related scales and psychological anxiety, when compared to healthy controls when assessed using a self-report inventory, the CSP. The differences were not related to age, age at onset, or disease duration.",,"Portala, K.;Westermark, K.;Ekselius, L.;von Knorring, L.",2001,Sep,,0,0,
496,Zinc acetate used to treat Wilson's disease,"Zinc acetate (Galzin, Gate Pharmaceutical Co.) was developed for the treatment of Wilson's disease, an inherited disorder characterized by copper accumulation and toxicity in the brain and liver. Zinc acetate has been approved by the US FDA for maintenance therapy in adult and pediatric patients with Wilson's disease, but is also effective in the treatment of pregnant patients and pre-symptomatic patients from the onset. It also has value as an adjunctive therapy to the initial treatment of symptomatic patients. Zinc's mechanism of action involves the induction of metallothionein (Mt) in the intestinal cells, which blocks copper absorption from the gut. A negative copper balance is caused not only by blocking the absorption of dietary copper, but also by blocking the reabsorption of the substantial amount of endogenously secreted copper in saliva, gastric juice and intestinal secretions. Zinc is totally effective in controlling copper levels and toxicity in Wilson's disease, as are other anti-copper drugs. Zinc's main advantage over other anticopper agents is its extremely low toxicity. The only side effect is some degree of initial gastric irritation in about 10% of patients, which usually decreases over time and becomes insignificant. As with all long-term therapies, compliance is an issue in some patients and requires regular monitoring with 24-hour urinary copper and zinc measurements. As with all anticopper therapies, overtreatment and induction of copper deficiency can occur over a long period of time. This is to be avoided, especially in children, as copper is needed for growth.

P1-type ATPases have a distinctive amino-terminal domain containing the conserved metal-binding motif GXXCXXC. ZntA has one copy of this motif while ATP7B has six copies. The effect of swapping the amino terminal domains of ATP7B and ZntA was examined. Chimeric proteins were constructed in which either the entire amino-terminal domain of ATP7B or only its sixth metal-binding motif replaced the amino-terminal domain of ZntA. Both chimeras conferred resistance to lead, zinc, and cadmium salts but not to copper salts. The purified chimeras showed activity with lead, cadmium, zinc and mercury, which are substrates of ZntA. There was no activity with copper or silver, which are substrates of ATP7B. The chimeras were 2-3 times less active than ZntA. Thus, the amino-terminal domain of P1-type ATPases cannot alter the metal specificity determined by the transmembrane segment. These results also suggest that this domain interacts with the rest of the transporter in a metal ion specific manner; the amino-terminal domain of ATP7B cannot replace that of ZntA in restoring full catalytic activity.",,"Hou, Z.

500,Ultrastructural identification of iron and copper accumulation in the liver of a male patient with Wilson's disease,"There is growing evidence that ceruloplasmin, a copper-containing protein with ferroxidase activity, plays an important role in iron metabolism. The reduction in ferroxidase activity as a result of ceruloplasmin deficiency can induce iron accumulation in various organs as a result of impaired iron transport. A 37-year-old man presented with intention tremor of the right hand. Liver function tests were almost normal, but trace element parameters were abnormal: hypocuperemia, hypoceruloplaminemia, and hyperferritinemia. Abdominal imaging revealed cirrhosis of the liver with increased density. A diagnosis of the neurological form of Wilson's disease was confirmed by hepatic copper deposits obtained by blind biopsy and the patient was diagnosed as compound heterozygous for ATP7B mutations. He was treated with 2500 mg/day trientine hydrochloride per os. The second examination was carried out after 20 months of treatment. Treatment further reduced serum ceruloplasmin levels from 8.9 to less than 4.0 mg/dl. Serum ferroxidase activity was as low as 70 U/L during treatment. Post-treatment liver histology became negative for copper but remained positive for iron. Copper X-rays from hepatocyte lysosomes were no longer detected, but iron X-rays were still very high after treatment.

First, it emphasizes the importance of recognizing atypical clinical presentations of potentially lethal recessive features for which therapy is available. Second, it shows that even in a monogenic disease like WD, the phenotype cannot easily be extrapolated from the mutated genotype; this patient had a relatively late-onset form of WD despite homozygosity for a genetic lesion that resulted in what appeared to be complete loss of function of the WD copper transporter.",,"Prella, M.;Baccala, R.;Horisberger, J.

503,Copper control as antiangiogenic cancer therapy: Lessons learned from treating Wilson's disease,"The search for new anti-copper drugs for Wilson's disease has culminated in two exciting new drugs: zinc for maintenance therapy and tetrathiomolybdate(TM) for initial therapy. Both are effective and non-toxic. TM is a very potent, fast-acting new anti-copper drug and its properties may be useful well beyond Wilson's disease. Angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels) is required for tumor growth, and adequate levels of copper appear to be required for angiogenesis. We hypothesize that there is a ""window"" to which copper levels can be reduced that inhibits angiogenesis in tumors but does not interfere with copper's vital cellular functions. Using TM therapy, this approach has helped slow or stabilize tumor growth in several animal tumor models, and preliminary results are also very encouraging in human patients with a variety of advanced and metastatic malignancies. It is hypothesized that the availability of copper has played a fundamental role in growth regulation throughout evolution and that this is why so many angiogenic promoters appear to be dependent on copper levels.

504,Is Parkinson's disease the heterozygous form of Wilson's disease: PD = 1/2 WD?,"Patients with Wilson disease (WD) often present with Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, most patients with PD have reduced ceruloplasmin, a feature of Wilson disease. WD is an autosomal recessive disease (requiring two defective copies of a gene to produce a homozygous individual) affecting 1 in 1000 people. However, the number of people with one defective copy (heterozygotes) is much larger, probably around 2% of the population. I assume that the large number of heterozygotes for WD are at greatly increased risk for idiopathic PD, since these people accumulate free copper in the basal ganglia more slowly than homozygotes, which accounts for the fact that PD usually manifests itself after the age of 40. year of life developed. In WD, ceruloplasmin deficiency leads to accumulation of free Cu in liver, brain, kidneys, etc. The excess Cu leads to impaired Zn absorption, which would account for the low brain Zn levels of PD patients. In addition, the high levels of Fe found in the substantia nigra of PD patients can possibly be explained by the binding of free Cu to iron-binding protein-1 (IBP-1), causing and preventing its dysfunction, that it detaches from the transferrin receptor (TfR) inhibitory gene, resulting in the expression of TfR even when the cell contains a lot of Fe. The gradual accumulation of Fe and Cu would explain the damage done to the substantia nigra by free radicals catalyzed by these two metals, which is aggravated by the low concentrations of CuZnSOD due to the Zn deficiency mentioned above. Furthermore, if this hypothesis is correct, PD could be used to discover the gene (or genes) responsible for WD and vice versa. Furthermore, idiopathic PD could be prevented by identifying the heterozygous individuals and giving them Zn supplementation, Cu chelation therapy, and phlebotomy to eliminate Fe.",,"Johnson, S.",2001,Feb,https://dx.doi.org/10.1054/mehy.2000.1134,0,0,

506,Essential role for the mammalian copper transporter Ctr1 in copper homeostasis and embryonic development,"The trace metal copper (Cu) plays an essential role in biology as a cofactor for many enzymes, including Cu, Zn, superoxide dismutase, cytochrome oxidase, ceruloplasmin, lysyl oxidase, and dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Consequently, Cu transport at the cell surface and delivery of Cu to intracellular compartments are critical events for a variety of biological processes. The components that orchestrate intracellular Cu transport and their role in Cu homeostasis have been elucidated through studies in model microorganisms and through the characterization of the molecular basis of Cu-related genetic diseases, including Menkes disease and Wilson disease . However, little is known about the mechanisms of Cu uptake at the plasma membrane and the consequences of defects in this process in mammals. Here we show that the mouse Ctr1 gene encodes a component of the Cu transport machinery and that mice heterozygous for Ctr1 exhibit tissue-specific defects in copper accumulation and in the activities of copper-dependent enzymes. Mice that completely lack Ctr1 have profound growth and developmental defects and die in utero in mid-pregnancy. These results demonstrate a crucial role for Cu sensing by the Ctr1 transporter in Cu homeostasis and mammalian embryonic development.",,"Lee, J.;Prohaska, J. R.;Thiele, D.

507,"Micronutrient accumulation and depletion in schizophrenia, epilepsy, autism and Parkinson's disease?","Zinc has several crucial roles in brain development and maintenance: it binds to p53, prevents it from binding to supercoiled DNA, and ensures that p53 causes expression of several important genes, such as z-activator peptide (PACAP), which is the controls embryonic development of the cerebral cortex, adrenal glands, etc.; it is required for the production of CuZnSOD and Zn-Thionein, which are essential to prevent oxidative damage; It is required for many proteins, some with Zn fingers, many of which are essential enzymes for growth and homeostasis. For example, Zn enzymes are involved in the synthesis of serotonin, and since serotonin is necessary for melatonin synthesis, Zn deficiency can lead to low levels of both hormones. Unfortunately, when excess Cu and Cd are present, Zn levels tend to be low. In addition, high estrogen levels tend to cause increased absorption of Cu and Cd, and smoking and eating foods contaminated with Cd lead to high levels of Cd. In addition, ethanol intake increases excretion of Zn and Mg (which acts as a cofactor for CuZnSOD). Elevated Cu levels can also be found in people with Wilson's disease, which is a rather rare disease. However, the heterozygous form (just one defective copy of the chromosome) is not that rare. Therefore, the developing fetus of a pregnant woman with low Zn and high Cu may experience major difficulties in early brain development, which may later manifest as schizophrenia, autism, or epilepsy. Similarly, a person who gradually accumulates Cu will tend to experience a gradual depletion of Zn, with a corresponding increase in oxidative damage, eventually leading to Parkinson's disease. Also discussed are the crucial roles of histidine, histamine, vitamin D, essential fatty acids, vitamin E, peroxynitrate, etc. in the possible oxidative damage that occurs in these mental illnesses.

509,Wilson's disease with severe hepatic impairment: beneficial effects of early administration of D-penicillamine,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease, heralded by severe hepatic insufficiency, is a rare disease for which emergency liver transplantation is considered the only effective therapy. OBJECTIVES: To report the characteristics of Wilson's disease with severe hepatic impairment in a series of 17 patients and during the second phase of the study to evaluate the effectiveness of a policy consisting of early administration of D-penicillamine. PATIENTS: Seventeen consecutive patients with Wilson's disease were studied. During the first study period (until 1979), none of the patients received D-penicillamine. During the second period (after 1979), all patients without encephalopathy received D-penicillamine on admission. RESULTS: The four patients observed during the first period who did not have encephalopathy on admission and were not receiving D-penicillamine developed encephalopathy and died. Among the 13 consecutive patients observed during the second period, two patients with encephalopathy were not receiving D-penicillamine on admission and were transplanted. The 11 remaining patients all received D-penicillamine. Ten of these patients survived without the need for transplantation and reverted to compensated liver disease without hepatic insufficiency. In one patient, liver failure progressed and a transplant was required. CONCLUSIONS: In most patients with Wilson's disease presenting with severe hepatic impairment and without encephalopathy at admission, early administration of D-penicillamine was associated with transplant-free survival. These results suggest the importance of early diagnosis of this form of Wilson's disease before the onset of encephalopathy and support early administration of D-penicillamine, which in most cases could avoid the need for transplantation.",,"Durand, F.;Bernuau, J.;Giostra, E.;Mentha, G.;Shouval, D.;Degott, C.;Benhamou, J.

Pediatric patients aged 1 to 5 years received zinc 25 mg twice daily; Patients aged 6 to 15 years, if they weighed less than 125 pounds, received 25 mg of zinc three times a day; and patients 16 years and older received zinc 50 mg three times a day. Efficacy (or overtreatment) of patients was monitored up to their 19th birthday by measurement of urinary and plasma copper, urine and plasma zinc, liver function tests, and quantitative speech and neurological scores. The toxicity of the patients was monitored by measurements of the blood count, blood biochemistry, urinalysis and clinical follow-up. 34 patients aged 3.2 to 17.7 years were included in the study. All doses met the efficacy goals of copper control, zinc levels, neurological improvement, and maintenance of liver function, with the exception of episodes of poor compliance. No case of overtreatment was identified. Four patients had mild and transient stomach discomfort from the zinc. Zinc therapy in pediatric patients appears to have a slightly adverse effect on the high-density lipoprotein/total cholesterol ratio, in contrast to the results of a previous large study in mostly adults.

513,Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting from the absence or dysfunction of a copper-transporting P-type ATPase encoded on chromosome 13. This ATPase is expressed in hepatocytes where it is localized in the trans-Golgi network and transports copper into the blood via the secretory pathway for incorporation into ceruloplasmin and excretion into the bile. Under physiological circumstances, biliary excretion is the only mechanism for copper excretion and therefore progressive accumulation of copper in the liver occurs in affected individuals. When hepatic storage capacity is exceeded, cell death occurs with release of copper into the plasma, hemolysis, and tissue deposition. Childhood presentation may include chronic hepatitis, asymptomatic cirrhosis, or acute liver failure. In young adults, neuropsychiatric symptoms predominate and include dystonia, tremor, personality changes, and cognitive impairment secondary to central nervous system copper accumulation. Laboratory diagnosis of Wilson's disease is confirmed by decreased serum ceruloplasmin, increased urinary copper, and increased hepatic copper. Molecular genetic analysis is complex as more than 100 unique mutations have been identified and most individuals are composite heterozygotes. Copper chelation with penicillamine is an effective therapy in most patients, and liver transplantation is curative in those with irreversible liver failure. The elucidation of the molecular genetic basis of Wilson's disease has provided new insights into the mechanisms of cellular copper homeostasis. [References: 106]",,"Loudianos, G.;Gitlin, J.

It has been hypothesized that increased LDL peroxidation caused by high levels of copper could contribute to damage to the liver and other tissues. The group studied included 45 people with Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine or zinc salts and a control group of 36 healthy people. Lipids were determined by enzymatic methods, alpha-tocopherol by high performance liquid chromatography, the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation in vitro by absorbance changes at 234 nm over 5 h, and end products of LDL lipid oxidation as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and alpha-tocopherol levels were significantly lower in patients with Wilson's disease compared to controls. No difference in LDL oxidation in vitro was detected between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: An increased sensitivity of isolated LDL to lipid peroxidation in vitro was not observed in patients with Wilson's disease. However, it cannot be excluded that due to the low levels of alpha-tocopherol, lipid peroxidation in the tissues may play a role in the pathogenesis of tissue damage in this disease.",,"Rodo, M.;Czonkowska, A.;Pulawska, M.;Swiderska, M.;Tarnacka, B.;Wehr, H.",2000,Sep,,0,0,

Infertility and amenorrhea have been reported in women and hypogonadism in men with WM. Our study was designed to analyze the fertility of patients with WD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the course of pregnancy and delivery in 31 untreated women (mean age 22.5 years, 82 pregnancies) and 15 women (mean age 26.2 years, 25 pregnancies) treated with D-penicillamine (Dp) or zinc were, using a questionnaire sulfate (ZnS). We also examined the fertility of 27 men (mean age 27.2 years). We analyzed the congenital anomalies and frequency of WM in our patients' children. RESULTS: One in 10 untreated women had difficulty conceiving. The number and type of pathology (threatening abortion, gestosis, stillbirth, premature birth) were similar in treated and untreated patients. In both groups mentioned, spontaneous miscarriage was the most common pathology, found in 26% of the untreated and 26.6% of the treated women. This percentage is higher than in the general population. Most births in patients with WM are spontaneous. Neither developmental malformations nor serious disorders were found in the offspring of our treated patients, 3 children of untreated patients were born with congenital heart defects. We examined the copper metabolism in 78 of the 110 children of our patients and diagnosed WM in 5 cases (from 3 families). Of 27 men examined, only 1 was impotent. CONCLUSION: The risk of complications during pregnancy in asymptomatic and treated patients is higher than in the general population, but it does not make reproductive impossible.",,"Tarnacka, B.;Rodo, M.;Cichy, S.;Czlonkowska, A.",2000,Jun,,0,0,
519,Wilson's disease - early onset and lessons from a pediatric cohort in India,"AIM: To study the clinical profile at presentation and follow-up of cases of Wilson's disease presenting to this hospital. METHODS: Medical histories of children diagnosed with Wilson disease (WD) who were admitted to the hospital or admitted to the pediatric outpatient department were reviewed retrospectively for clinical features, examinations, and family screening at the time of presentation. The treatment received by the patients was noted. The clinical profile at follow-up was recorded in terms of treatment side effects and whether the patient improved, worsened, or remained the same, either from the records or, if possible, by calling the patient for follow-up. RESULTS: Analysis of 25 children with Wilson's disease consisting of 19 index cases and 6 siblings discovered at family screening revealed that the mean age of onset for hepatic presentation was 6.8 years versus 8 years for the neurological patient . A quarter of the index cases have a family history strongly suggestive of Wilson's disease, which was previously overlooked. The clinical picture was hepatic in 5 patients, purely neurological in 5, mixed hepatic and neurological in 9, hemolytic anemia in 1, and polyarthritis in 1. Patients received treatment with D-penicillamine, zinc, pyridoxine, and a low-copper diet. Follow-up 18 patients showed improvement in the majority, residual dysarthria in seven, prolonged persistence of KF rings in 15, and complications such as renal tubular acidosis with osteopenia in one. CONCLUSION: The early age of onset of symptoms, the ongoing persistence of KF rings, and the progression of symptoms among siblings despite therapy is of interest as it may be related to high copper intake reflecting the practice of using brass or copper utensils Cooking Because a large number of children have either a history of jaundice or sibling death from jaundice or cirrhosis, a high index of suspicion and screening for KF rings is emphasized as a simple and inexpensive method of early detection of a curable disease, based on stage and family screening of all index cases is mandatory. The progression of symptoms in siblings receiving oral administration of zinc and low-dose pencillamine indicates that zinc alone is not sufficient for prophylaxis.",,"Kalra, V.;Khurana, D.;Mittal, R.",2000,Jun,,0,1,
520,Visual pathway abnormalities: Wilson's disease: an electrophysiological study using electroretinography and visual evoked potentials,"The pathogenesis of the visual evoked potential abnormalities (PRVEP) in patients with Wilson's disease has not been investigated to date. Because electroretinography (ERG) assesses the functional integrity of the retina, it has been used in conjunction with PRVEP to locate the abnormalities in PRVEP in Wilson patients. Ten patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease underwent PRVEP and flash ERG shortly after diagnosis. PRVEP latencies were prolonged compared to controls (P<0.001). Photopic and scotopic A-waves and oscillatory potentials were prolonged (P<0.02) with a reduction in photopic A- and B-wave amplitudes (P<0.001). Six of these patients underwent repeat PRVEP and flash ERG after clinical improvement with specific therapy. Comparison of visual electrophysiology studies before and after treatment revealed a significant reduction in PRVEP and flash ERG A-wave latencies (P<0.05) with increases in amplitudes of P100 of PRVEP (P<0.05), A - and B-waves of lightning ERG (P<0.01). These findings confirm the reported PRVEP changes in WD and additionally demonstrate the reversibility of the retinal dysfunction that partially contributes to the PRVEP abnormalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ERG study in patients with Wilson's disease in the literature. Furthermore, there were no previous reports in the literature evaluating the effect of a specific treatment on PRVEP and ERG in Wilson's disease.",,"Satishchandra, P.;Ravishankar Naik, K.",2000,2001-05-01 00:00:00,,0,0,
521,Inhibition of carboxypeptidase A by D-penicillamine: mechanism and implications for drug design,"Zinc metalloprotease inhibitors are usually designed to inactivate the enzyme by forming a stable ternary complex with the enzyme and zinc in the active site. D-cysteine inhibits carboxypeptidase, ZnCPD, by forming such a complex with a K(i) of 2.3 micromolar. In contrast, the anti-arthritis drug D-penicillamine, D-PEN, which differs from D-Cys only in the presence of two methyl groups on the beta carbon, inhibits ZnCPD by promoting the release of the active zinc. We have given such inhibitors the name of catalytic chelating agents. Inhibition is a two-step process characterized by the formation of a complex with the enzyme (K(i(initial)) = 1.2 mM) followed by release of the active site zinc at rates up to 420- times faster than spontaneous release. The initial rate of substrate hydrolysis after the completion of the second step also depends on the D-PEN concentration, reflecting the formation of a thermodynamic equilibrium governed by the stability constants of the chelator and apocarboxypeptidase for zinc (K(i(final)) = 0 .25mM). The interaction of D-PEN and D-Cys with the active site metal was studied by replacing the zinc in the active site with a chromophoric cobalt atom. Both inhibitors disrupt the dd transitions of CoCPD in the 500–600 nm range within milliseconds after mixing, but only the CoCPD.D-Cys complex shows a strong S → Co(II) charge transfer band at 340 nm, indicating a metal indicates -sulphur bond. While the D-Cys complex is stable, the CoCPD.D-PEN complex decays to apoenzyme and Co(D-PEN)(2) with a half-life of 0.5 s. D-PEN is the first drug found to inhibit a metalloprotease by increasing the dissociation rate constant of the active site metal. The ability of D-PEN to catalyze metal removal from carboxypeptidase A and other zinc proteases suggests a possible mechanism of action in arthritis and Wilson's disease and may also underlie complications related to its clinical use.",,"Chong, C.

522,Wilson's disease with superimposed autoimmune features: two-case report and review,"We describe two women, ages 15 and 23, respectively, who presented with classic features of Wilson's disease (WD) and multiple features of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The first patient was initially diagnosed as AIH and treated with prednisolone, which produced clinical improvement with an increase in serum albumin from 22 to 30 g/L and a decrease in aspartate aminotransferase from 103 to 47 U/L. Subsequent diagnosis of WD and the introduction of penicillamine showed excellent improvement and complete normalization of liver function tests. The second patient, also initially diagnosed with AIH, was treated with steroids and azathioprine with initial improvement but subsequent deterioration. The diagnosis of WD was made 2 years after the initial diagnosis of AIH, when the patient progressed to end-stage liver disease and required a transplant. Therefore, treatment with d-penicillamine was not attempted. We conclude that thorough screening for WD is required in patients with AIH, particularly when the response to steroid therapy is poor. Conversely, in patients suffering from WD with superimposed features of AIH, a combination of steroids and penicillamine may be beneficial. [References: 17]",,"Milkiewicz, P.;Saksena, S.;Hubscher, S.

523,Copper transport and its defect in Wilson disease: characterization of the copper-binding domain of the Wilson disease ATPase,"Copper is an essential trace element that forms an integral part of many enzymes. While traces of copper are needed to sustain life, excess copper is extremely toxic. Here an attempt is made to present the current understanding of the normal transport of copper in terms of absorption, intracellular transport and toxicity. Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder of copper transport that leads to accumulation of copper in organs such as the liver and brain, resulting in progressive hepatic and neurological damage. The gene responsible for Wilson's disease (ATP7B) is predicted to encode a putative P-type copper-transporting ATPase. An important feature of this ATPase is the presence of a large N-terminal domain containing six repeats of a copper-binding motif thought to be responsible for binding this metal prior to its transport across the membrane. We have cloned, expressed and purified the N-terminal domain (approximately 70 kD) of the Wilson disease ATPase. Metal binding properties of the domain revealed that the protein binds several metals besides copper; However, copper has a higher affinity for the domain. The copper is bound to the domain in Cu(I) form with a copper:protein ratio of 6.5:1. X-ray absorption studies strongly suggest that Cu(I) atoms are ligated to cysteine residues. Circular dichroism spectral analysis suggests both secondary and tertiary structural changes upon copper binding to the domain. Copper binding studies suggest some degree of cooperativity in binding copper. These studies, along with detailed structural information of the copper-binding domain, will be crucial in determining the specific role played by the copper-transporting ATPase in the homeostatic control of copper in the body, and how copper transport is disrupted by mutations in the ATPase gene.",,"Sarkar, B.",2000,Apr,,0,0,
524,"CSF copper levels, blood-brain barrier function, and ceruloplasmin synthesis during treatment of Wilson's disease","During the treatment of four patients with cerebral manifestation of Wilson's disease, we measured cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum copper concentration, serum ceruloplasmin concentration, serum free copper concentration and CSF/serum albumin ratio (AR ). These measurements were taken as indicators of copper-related toxic effects on the brain and the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The half-life of the decrease in CSF copper concentration during therapy was 23.5 +/- 5.78 months (mean +/- SEM). The therapeutic target copper concentration in the liquor (mean normal concentration) is below 20 micrograms/l. The median duration of therapy required to normalize CSF copper levels in our patients, with a mean baseline level of 76.25 micrograms/L, was 47 months. During the first 10 months of treatment, there was an increase in measured blood-brain barrier disruption (measured as the ratio of albumin in CSF to albumin in serum, AR) in all cases. All patients showed an initial worsening of the neurological status, after a mean of 1.75 +/- 0.25 months. The maximum AR increase from baseline averaged 18.4 +/- 5.08%; this maximum was reached after an average of 6.9 +/- 1.5 months. AR normalized during therapy, indicating a reduction in toxicity in the blood-brain barrier region. The magnitude of AR increases in individual patients did not significantly correlate with CSF copper half-life, serum copper half-life, initial half-life of reduction in the (serum copper)/(serum ceruloplasmin) ratio, initial concentration of CSF copper or serum , initial concentration of free serum copper or initial dose of penicillamine (within the first 2 months). We conclude that the normalization of CSF copper concentration in patients with the cerebral manifestation of Wilson's disease is a slow process, even when therapy is adequate. The often-reported initial deterioration in neurological status may be reflected in the impairment of blood-brain barrier function, which we have measured here for the first time (using the CSF/serum albumin ratio parameter). Based on repeated measurements of AR over the course of treatment, the brain toxicity of mobilized copper appears to be assessable and therapy adjusted.",,"Stuerenburg, H.

A moderate increase in liver function tests was noted, but all other laboratory values were within normal limits. The marked hypersomnia was verified by 24-h cassette EEG polisomnography monitoring. No abnormality was noted on physical examination. EEG, brain CT and MRI were normal. Neither toxic nor infectious diseases were detectable. The diagnosis of WD was based on decreased ceruloplasmin, increased baseline and forced urinary excretion of copper, and decreased serum copper. The Kayser-Fleischer ring was not detectable. D-penicillamine (DPA) was introduced. 8-10 months after the start of therapy, the patient's complaints gradually disappeared. Control sleep recording 14 months after starting DPA therapy was normal.

DESIGN: Retrospective study with a median follow-up of 9 years. SETTING: University Medical Center. SUBJECTS: 34 children with liver involvement, aged 3 to 15 years, were diagnosed with Wilson's disease over a period of 18 years. METHODS: Diagnosis was based on the presence of family history and Kayser-Fleischer rings, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, and elevated urinary and hepatic copper concentrations. RESULTS: Four patients also had neurological manifestations. Eight patients were diagnosed with fulminant liver failure, which resulted in death within a few days. The most common symptoms were bloating and abdominal pain. Hepatomegaly was the predominant physical finding and serum transaminases were elevated in most patients. Twenty patients had histopathological cirrhosis and six chronic hepatitis. All patients with fulminant hepatic failure had hyperbilirubinemia with normal alkaline phosphatase and higher aspartate aminotransferase than alanine aminotransferase. The patients were treated with D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate. Three patients underwent liver transplantation. In addition to patients with fulminant liver failure, four other patients died of end-stage liver disease. Twenty-two patients were followed for a mean of 9 years. Four poorly compliant patients progressed to decompensated cirrhosis and the others were stable.

529,"Treatment of metastatic cancer with tetrathiomolybdate, an anticopper, antiangiogenic agent: phase I study","Preclinical and in vitro studies have established that copper is an important cofactor for angiogenesis. Tetrathiomolybdate(TM) was developed as an effective anticopper therapy for the initial treatment of Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder that results in abnormal accumulation of copper. Given the potency and uniqueness of TM's anticopper activity and its lack of toxicity, we hypothesized that TM would be a viable agent to achieve and maintain mild copper deficiency to impair neovascularization in metastatic solid tumors. Following preclinical work demonstrating the efficacy of this anti-copper approach in mouse tumor models, we conducted a phase I clinical study in 18 patients with metastatic cancer treated for three dose levels of oral TM (90, 105, and 120 mg/day ) were included. administered in six divided doses with and between meals. Serum ceruloplasmin (Cp) was used as a surrogate marker for total body copper. Since anemia is the first clinical sign of copper deficiency, the aim of the study was to reduce Cp to 20% of baseline without reducing hematocrit below 80% of baseline. Cp is a reliable and sensitive measure of copper status, and TM was nontoxic when Cp was reduced to 15-20% of baseline. The stage III dose of TM (120 mg/day) was effective in reaching the target Cp without added toxicity. TM-induced mild copper deficiency resulted in stable disease in five out of six patients who had target copper deficiency for at least 90 days.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Dick, R. D.;Grover, D.

538,Liver transplantation for Wilson's disease: a single center experience,"Wilson's disease is an inherited defect in copper excretion that leads to accumulation of copper in tissues with subsequent tissue damage. The most serious consequence is the progressive involvement of the central nervous system. The use of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in patients with neurological symptoms attributable to Wilson disease is controversial. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of OLT in patients with Wilson's disease, including those with neurological involvement resulting from accumulation of copper in the central nervous system. Between 1971 and 1993, OLT was performed in 45 patients (19 men [42.2%], 26 women [57.8%]) with Wilson's disease who were followed up for at least 4 years. Age at diagnosis of Wilson's disease ranged from 3 to 41 years (mean 17.7 +/- 7.4 years). Age at OLT ranged from 8 to 52 years (mean 22.3 +/- 9.4 years). Nineteen patients (42.2%) were younger than 18 years at OLT. Indications for OLT included chronic liver failure in 15 patients (33.3%) and fulminant (FHF) or subfulminant liver failure in 30 patients (66.6%). All but 1 of the 19 pediatric patients (94.7%) were in the latter group. 25 patients (55.5%) received D-penicillamine, 9 patients for more than 1 year; None of the patients treated long-term presented with FHF. Thirty-three patients (73.3%) survived more than 5 years after the OLT. Fourteen patients (31%) died during the post-transplant period; Seven of the 14 patients (50%) were younger than 18 years. Twelve patients died during the first 3 months after OLT from complications of disease and surgery, 10 of whom underwent FHF transplantation. The other 2 patients died from infectious problems 6 and 9 years after transplantation. Eleven patients (24.4%) required retransplantation for primary non-functioning graft (n=6), chronic rejection (n=4), and hepatic artery thrombosis (n=1). Seventeen patients (37.7%) presented with neurological abnormalities; 14 patients with Wilsonian neurological manifestations and 3 patients with components of increased intracranial pressure. Ten of the 13 surviving patients with hepatic insufficiency and neurological abnormalities in OLT showed significant neurological improvement. Our experience shows that OLT is a life-saving procedure in patients with end-stage Wilson's disease and is associated with excellent long-term survival. The neurological manifestation of the disease can improve significantly after OLT. Earlier transplantation in patients with an unsatisfactory response to medical treatment can prevent irreversible neurological deterioration and less than satisfactory improvement after OLT.",,"Eghtesad, B.;Nezakatgoo, N.;Geraci, L.

539,"Expression and mutagenesis of ZntA, a P-type zinc-transporting ATPase from Escherichia coli","P-type cation-transporting ATPases comprise a large family of membrane proteins whose members are found in eukaryotes, eubacteria and archaea. A phylogenetically ancient branch of the P-type ATPase family is involved in the transport of heavy metal ions such as copper, silver, cadmium, and zinc. In humans, two homologous P-type ATPases transport copper. Mutations in human proteins cause disorders of copper metabolism known as Wilson and Menkes disease. E. coli has two genes for heavy metal translocation of P-type ATPases. We have constructed an expression system for one of them, ZntA, which encodes a 732 amino acid residue protein capable of transporting Zn(2+). A vanadate-sensitive, Zn(2+)-dependent ATPase activity is present in the membrane fraction of our expression strain. In addition to Zn(2+), the heavy metal ions Cd(2+), Pb(2+) and Ag(+) activate the ATPase. Incubation of membranes from the expression strain with [gamma-(33)P]ATP in the presence of Zn(2+), Cd(2+), or Pb(2+) causes the phosphorylation of two membrane proteins with molecular weights of approximately 90 and 190 kDa, most likely representing the ZntA monomer and dimer, respectively. Although Cu(2+) can stimulate phosphorylation by [gamma-(33)P]ATP, it does not activate ATPase. Cu(2+) also prevents Zn(2+) activation of ATPase when present in a 2-fold excess over Zn(2+). Ag(+) and Cu(+) do not appear to promote phosphorylation of the enzyme. To study the effects of mutations in Wilson's disease, we constructed two ZntA site-directed mutants, His475Gln and Glu470Ala, whose human counterparts cause Wilson's disease. Both mutants show reduced metal ion-stimulated ATPase activity (about 30-40% of wild-type activity) and are much less efficiently phosphorylated by [gamma-(33)P]ATP than wild-type. Compared to the wild type, the Glu470Ala mutant is more phosphorylated by [(33)P]P(i) while the His475Gln mutant is less phosphorylated. These results suggest that the His475Gln mutation affects the reaction with ATP and P(i) and stabilizes the enzyme in a dephosphorylated state. The Glu470Ala mutant appears to prefer the E2 state. We conclude that His475 and Glu470 play important roles in the transport cycles of both Wilson disease ATPase and ZntA.",,"Okkeri, J.;Haltia, T.",1999,2019-10-01 00:00:00,,0,0,
540,Characterization of the interaction between Wilson and Menkes disease proteins and the cytoplasmic copper chaperone HAH1p,"Wilson's disease (WD) and Menkes' disease (MNK) are inherited disorders of copper metabolism. The genes that mutate to cause these disorders encode highly homologous copper-transporting ATPases. We use yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems along with an in vitro assay to demonstrate a specific, copper-dependent interaction between the six metal-binding domains of the WD and MNK ATPases and the cytoplasmic copper chaperone HAH1. We show that several metal-binding domains interact with HAH1p independently or in combination, although domains five and six of WDp in particular do not. Changing either the Met or Thr residue of the HAH1p-MTCXXC motif has no observable effect on the copper-dependent interaction, whereas changing either Cys residue abolishes the interaction. Mutation of any of the C-terminal Lys residues of HAH1p (Lys(56), Lys(57), or Lys(60)) to Gly does not affect the interaction, although deletion of the 15 C-terminal residues abolishes the interaction. We show that apo-HAH1p can bind to copper-loaded WDp in vitro, indicating the reversibility of copper transfer from HAH1p to WD/MNKp. The in vitro HAH1/WDp interaction is metalospecific; HAH1 preincubated with Cu(2+) or Hg(+), but not with Zn(2+), Cd(2+), Co(2+), Ni(3+), Fe(3+), or Cr(3 ). +) interacted with WDp. Finally, we model the protein-protein interaction and present a theoretical representation of the HAH1p.Cu.WD/MNKp complex.",,"Larin, D.;Mekios, C.;Das, K.;Ross, B.;Yang, A. S.;Gilliam, T.

It was found that serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) activity increased significantly upon treatment of Wistar rats with sulfide generated by hydrolytic degradation of TTM and DTM, with the latter being more readily degraded. The hydrolytic degradation of TTM was enhanced under acidic conditions. Cu in Cu-containing enzymes such as Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver and ceruloplasmin (Cp) in plasma was decreased by excess thiomolybdates, with the Cu in plasma being found in the form of a Cu/thiomolybdate/albumin complex . The decreased Cu levels in SOD and Cp were explained by the sequestration of Cu from their chaperones by thiomolybdates rather than direct Cu removal from the enzymes. Although both TTM and DTM remove Cu from MT, DTM is not useful as a therapeutic agent for Wilson's disease due to its ready hydrolysis and formation of sulfide.",,"Ogra, Y.;Komada, Y.;Suzuki, K.

543,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that leads to pathological accumulation of copper in many organs and tissues. The Wilson disease gene is located on human chromosome 13 and encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, -ATP7B. About a hundred mutations have been documented to date, occurring across the entire gene. The most common is the His1069Gln point mutation. Wilson's disease can occur in a variety of clinical conditions, the most common being liver disease (ranging from acute hepatitis, fulminant hepatic failure, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis), hemolytic anemia and neuropsychiatric disorders. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease is usually made on the basis of clinical findings (Kayser-Fleischer rings, typical neurological symptoms) and laboratory abnormalities (low serum ceruloplasmin, increased copper content in the liver). Molecular genetic testing is now the standard for testing asymptomatic siblings. Diagnosis in patients with liver disease is difficult and requires a combination of different laboratory parameters. Lifelong treatment with chelating agents (d-penicillamine, trientine) or zinc is usually sufficient to stabilize the patient and achieve clinical remission in most cases. Patients with advanced liver disease benefit from orthotopic liver transplantation. [References: 55]",,"Ferenci, P.",1999,Jun-Jul,,0,0,
544,Treatment and management of Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder related to copper metabolism. The clinical symptoms are due to copper deposits in various tissues including the liver, brain, kidney, cornea and others. The key treatment strategy is to reduce the amount of copper in the liver and other tissues by using both copper-chelating agents and a low-copper diet. As a copper chelating agent, D-penicillamine is considered the first choice. Patients require 15-25 mg/kg daily in the early stages of treatment and this drug should also be administered more than 2 hours before meals. Some undesirable or serious side effects such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and nephrotic syndrome occur in 20-25% of all patients. In such cases, trienethylenetetramine (trientine) appears to be as effective as penicillamine. This drug is usually used when D-penicillamine needs to be stopped. It is also sometimes given to patients with neurological symptoms as the first-line drug. It is administered in doses of 40-50 mg/kg daily in the same way as D-penicillamine. The administration of zinc salts has also turned out to be an interesting supportive therapy for both treatments. A dose of 5-7.5 mg/kg daily is administered before meals. Dietary copper levels should be less than 1 mg/day in the early stages of treatment. Thereafter, it can be increased to 1.0-1.5 mg/day in well-controlled periods. Liver transplants are now performed in many countries in patients with either the fulminant or chronic progressive form of Wilson's disease.

545,1H NMR studies of the reactions of copper(I) and copper(II) with D-penicillamine and glutathione,"Reactions of copper ions with D-penicillamine (PSH) were monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy in the presence and absence of glutathione (GSH) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In D2O solution at pD = 7.4, PSH coordinates to Cu+ to form PS(-)-Cu+ under an argon atmosphere, as indicated by the broadening of each signal. In the presence of dioxygen, the complex was converted into the well-characterized purple cluster species composed of Cu+, Cu2+, and PS2-. Addition of GSH to this solution rapidly decomposed the cluster by reducing Cu2+ to Cu+. However, the cluster species was reproduced after several hours as Cu+ was oxidized back to Cu2+. The solution containing both PSH and GSH under aerobic conditions formed three possible disulfides, PSSP, GSSG and PSSG. The addition of Cu+ to this solution again led to the purple cluster through several redox reactions. Based on these results, it was concluded that the coexistence of PSH and/or PSSP with Cu+ and/or Cu2+ leads to the formation of the stable cluster species, regardless of the presence or absence of other thiols such as GSH. This must be one of the reasons why PSH acts as an effective drug for Wilson's disease in living cells.",,"Kato, N.;Nakamura, M.;Uchiyama, T.",1999,2015-06-01 00:00:00,,0,0,

549,Treatment of copper-associated liver disease in childhood,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Copper-associated liver disease is associated with high liver copper concentrations and progressive liver disease in infancy or childhood. The disease is believed to result from excessive dietary copper overload (copper-enriched water supply) and, moreover, genetic predisposition. Treatment with penicillamine for Indian childhood disease, which probably has the same etiology, is effective if started early enough, as it is for Wilson's disease. Our aim was to describe the clinical features of copper-associated liver disease and to report our experiences with different treatment options in German children. METHODS/RESULTS: Two boys aged 6 and 10 months with abdominal distension due to hepatosplenomegaly. The diagnosis of copper-associated liver disease was made on the basis of the feeding history, standard liver function parameters, liver biopsy, and assessment of dry weight copper concentration and urinary copper excretion. Both had micronodular cirrhosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and Mallory bodies. In children, after the introduction of penicillamine therapy and a copper-restricted diet, an improvement in liver function has been observed. The treatment was stopped after 18 months when the copper concentration in the liver had normalized. Despite the start of therapy, child B developed acute liver failure. The boy was successfully transplanted. Both children are currently healthy 10 years after the transplant and 4 years after the start of chelation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that early chelation therapy with penicillamine can be successful in children with copper-associated liver disease. With delayed diagnosis and acute liver failure, liver transplantation is required. Our case reports underscore the urgent need for rapid diagnosis of copper-associated liver disease in order to initiate early chelation therapy. Copper-associated liver disease should of course be considered in liver disease of unknown cause. Possible causes of excessive dietary copper intake should be investigated.",,"Rodeck, B.;Kardoff, R.;Melter, M.",1999,2028-06-01 00:00:00,,0,0,
550,molybdenum,"Molybdenum does not occur naturally in pure metallic form and of the 5 oxidation states (2-6) the predominant species are Mo(IV) and Mo(VI). Molybdenum polymerizes rapidly in solution to form a variety of complex polymolybdate compounds. The majority of molybdenum is used in metallurgical applications (stainless steel, cast iron alloys). Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate is an experimental chelating agent for Wilson's disease. For the general population, diet is the most important source of molybdenum and concentrations in water and air are usually negligible. The average daily food intake is about 0.1-0.5 mg molybdenum Molybdenum is an essential element with relatively low toxicity. Molybdenum-containing enzymes catalyze basic metabolic reactions in the carbon, sulfur and nitrogen cycles. Molybdenum is eliminated via the kidneys and is usually complete within a few weeks. Molybdenum disease (tear) is a form of molybdenum toxicity that produces a disease similar to copper deficiency in ruminants. Few data are available on the human toxicity of molybdenum. A gout-like syndrome and pneumoconiosis have been associated with excess molybdenum concentrations, but the poor design of the studies prevents adequate determination of the etiology of these effects.

551,copper,"Copper is an essential trace element that is an important catalyst for heme synthesis and iron absorption. Copper is the third most common trace element in the body after zinc and iron. Copper is a precious metal, like silver and gold. Useful industrial properties include high thermal and electrical conductivity, low corrosion, alloyability, and ductility. Most metallic copper is found in electrical applications. Copper is a component of intrauterine contraceptives and the release of copper is necessary for their contraceptive effect. The average daily copper intake in the US is about 1 mg Cu, with the primary source being diet. The bioavailability of dietary copper is approximately 65-70%, depending on a variety of factors including chemical form, interactions with other metals and dietary components. The biological half-life of dietary copper is 13-33 days, with bile excretion being the major route of elimination. Copper sulfate is a gastric irritant that causes erosion of the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic copper toxicity is rare and primarily affects the liver. Childhood Wilson's disease and Indian cirrhosis are examples of severe chronic liver disease resulting from a genetic predisposition to accumulation of copper in the liver. The copper concentration in the serum ranges up to about 1.5 mg/L in healthy people. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur at whole blood concentrations near 3 mg Cu/L. Chelating agents (CaNa2EDTA, BAL) are recommended for severe poisoning, but there is little pharmacokinetic data to evaluate the efficacy of these agents. [References: 118]",,"Barceloux, D.

552,"Metal ion transporters in mammals: structure, function, and pathological implications","Despite the importance of metal ions in several catalytic functions, until recently little molecular information was available on the mechanisms by which metal ions are actively taken up by mammalian cells. The classical concept for iron uptake in mammalian cells was endocytosis of transferrin-bound Fe3+ by the transferrin receptor. Studies in hypotransferrineemic mice demonstrated that in the gut mucosa, transferrin is plasma derived and that its presence in the gut lumen is not required for the absorption of dietary iron. This suggests that other non-receptor-mediated uptake systems exist, at least in the gut. The molecular identification of metal ion transporters is of great importance, especially since it is believed that an increasing number of human diseases are associated with disorders of metal ion homeostasis, including metal ion overload and deficiency diseases (e.g. anemia, hemochromatosis, Menkes disease, Wilson's disease) related disease) and neurodegenerative diseases (ie Alzheimer's, Friedreich's ataxia and Parkinson's disease). In addition, susceptibility to mycobacterial infection is caused by defects in metal ion transporters. The pathological implications of impaired metal ion homeostasis confirm the vital role that these metal ions play in the catalytic function of many enzymes, in gene regulation (zinc finger proteins) and in free radical homeostasis. Recent discoveries have greatly expanded our understanding of how metal ions are taken up or released from mammalian cells. The purpose of this review is to summarize these advances and provide an overview of the growing number of metal ion transporters in mammals. [References: 109]",,"Rolfs, A.;Hediger, M.

In this study, trientine and ascorbate, known to have beneficial effects in an animal model of Wilson's disease, were administered to transgenic mice overexpressing a mutant human SOD1 (G93A). The onset of neurological symptoms in the treated group was significantly delayed compared to that in the control group, and the time to complete paralysis was also delayed in the treated group. Since the active ingredients used in this study cause low toxicity in animals and humans, this treatment could be a good candidate for clinical use.",,"Nagano, S.;Ogawa, Y.;Yanagihara, T.;Sakoda, S.",1999,2023-04-01 00:00:00,,0,0,

555,Zinc therapy increases duodenal concentrations of metallothionein and iron in patients with Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: Wilson's disease is effectively treated by the administration of zinc, which increases metallothionein levels in vitro. To determine whether the latter also occurs in humans, we measured metallothionein and trace element concentrations in the duodenal mucosa of 15 patients with Wilson's disease: 12 treated with zinc sulfate, two treated with penicillamine and one previously untreated. The control group consisted of 17 patients with dyspepsia who underwent the same study protocol. METHODS: Metallothionein and trace element concentrations were measured in duodenal mucosal biopsies using the silver-saturated hemolysate method and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. RESULTS: Metallothionein concentrations increased by 1500% after zinc and 150% after penicillamine in patients with Wilson's disease compared to controls who had negative endoscopy and patients with Wilson's disease who were not treated. A significant correlation was found between metallothionein and duodenal zinc concentrations. The concentration of iron in the mucosa increased in patients with Wilson's disease regardless of whether they were treated with zinc or penicillamine. Duodenum with duodenal inflammation also had significantly elevated iron levels compared to normal duodenum. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc administration increases intestinal metallothionein in patients with Wilson's disease. The blockage of copper uptake and its excretion in stool when intestinal cells are desquamated probably explains one of the mechanisms underlying zinc treatment. Despite normal endoscopy, patients with Wilson's disease have elevated mucosal iron concentrations, similar to controls with duodenitis. Metallothionein can therefore prevent oxidative damage caused by metal toxicity.",,"Sturniolo, G.

METHODS: Retrospective review of the clinical, laboratory, and histological features and prognosis of Wilson's disease in 26 Spanish children. RESULTS: First physician visit at age 9.8 +/- 3.4 years (range 4-16 years) was prompted by accidentally detected liver dysfunction (61%), symptoms of liver disease (27%), family screening (8%) and extrapyramidal symptoms and personality changes (4%). Laboratory data of liver failure were available for 27%. All copper metabolism test results (total serum copper, 24-hour urine output, serum ceruloplasmin) were abnormal in 62%, two in 27%, and one in 11%. All patients identified with extrahepatic involvement at the time of diagnosis had severe liver disease. Histological findings were portal fibrosis with steatosis (29%), cirrhosis (21%), portal fibrosis (17%), chronic active hepatitis (17%), and minimal changes or normality (17%). All but one patient were given penicillamine. Four children underwent liver transplantation, three of whom received penicillamine for 12, 45 and 70 days. Three other patients recovered from liver failure after 1 year of treatment with penicillamine. After a follow-up of 4.5 +/- 3.3 years, all children survived. Penicillamine caused severe toxicity in one patient.

These abnormalities have mainly been described in patients with primary immunological disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. To clarify whether d-PA-induced immune disorders are limited to patients with a genetic predisposition to develop autoimmune diseases or to a direct drug effect, we tested the presence of different autoantibodies and HLA molecular typing in 17 patients with Wilson's disease treated with this drug . Low titre (10 JDFU) circulating islet cell autoantibodies (ICA) were detected in 2/17 patients, while another patient was positive for the presence of insulin autoantibodies. None of the sera tested showed reactivity for glutamic acid decarboxylase or ICA512. Five out of twelve patients were positive for anti-single-stranded DNA autoantibodies. HLA molecular typing of the autoantibody-positive subjects revealed that they carry HLA haplotypes that are not associated with insulin-dependent diabetes. The insulin response to the intravenous glucose tolerance test in two patients with autoantibodies was normal. A second blood test of the autoantibody-positive patients 5 months after the initial evaluation resulted in all three converting to negativity.

563,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc: XV long-term follow-up studies,"Wilson's disease is an inherited copper accumulation disease caused by a failure of the biliary excretion of excess copper. Accumulated copper causes liver disease in these patients, and in perhaps two-thirds of the patients it causes brain damage leading to clinical neurological or psychiatric dysfunction. With maintenance treatment, the positive copper balance is reversed. The earliest approaches used chelators such as penicillamine or trientine, which increase urinary excretion of copper. A more recent approach uses zinc, which blocks the absorption of copper and increases stool copper excretion. Due to the high content of endogenously secreted copper in dietary secretions, reabsorption of which is partially blocked by zinc therapy, zinc serves to remove accumulated copper from the body and prevent its reaccumulation. In this article, we present data on the long-term follow-up (up to 10 years) of maintenance zinc therapy in 141 patients with Wilson's disease. The data presented demonstrate that zinc is effective as a sole therapy in the long-term maintenance treatment of Wilson's disease and that it has low toxicity. The results indicate the effectiveness of zinc therapy in treating the pre-symptomatic patient from baseline. We also present limited data on the use of zinc in the treatment of pregnant patients and children with Wilson's disease; these data also indicate efficacy and low toxicity.

570,Wilson's disease and copper toxicosis in dogs,"In this article, we provide an overview of the current clinical and research status of Wilson's disease and copper toxicosis in dogs. One of the major clinical challenges in Wilson's disease is for clinicians to recognize the possibility of Wilson's disease when young patients have liver disease, psychiatric illness, or a movement disorder-type neurological condition. Once the possibility of the disease has been identified, many copper-related tests are available that are fairly accurate in diagnosing or ruling out. It's important to remember that the condition is hereditary and that family members at risk, especially siblings, should be screened. The cloning of the Wilson disease gene raised the possibility that a direct DNA test could be developed that would allow convenient screening of specific patients and family members. However, the large number of mutations already found, with no small group of mutations dominating the picture, has thwarted this approach. Once the diagnosis has been made, various therapies are available. We use zinc for maintenance therapy, therapy for pre-symptomatic patients and therapy for pregnant patients. For the initial therapy of patients with liver diseases, we use a combination of zinc and trientine. We use tetrathiomolybdate for the initial therapy of patients with neurological diseases. Canine copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers is due to a gene different from the gene for Wilson's disease. However, the disease is treatable with the same range of anticopper therapies that work in humans. Recently, we identified the linkage of the copper toxin gene to a microsatellite marker, thereby providing Bedlington terrier breeders with a linkage test. [References: 36]",,"Brewer, G.

Clinical study with 44 cases,"BACKGROUND: In children with Wilson's disease, no clinical or laboratory data are specific for the diagnosis as in adulthood. AIM: Clinical aspects and parameters of copper metabolism in a large series of pediatric cases are evaluated in order to establish certain criteria for diagnosis and for proper treatment, even in difficult cases. Methods: Clinical aspects, histological features, laboratory parameters and data on copper metabolism were examined in 44 children with Wilson's disease. Forty patients treated with penicillamine were followed up (median 77 months). RESULTS: The 44 cases were classified as: asymptomatic forms (nine cases, including six siblings of the affected individuals), chronic hepatitis (23 cases), hepatocerebral manifestations (four cases), decompensated cirrhosis (six cases), fulminant hepatic failure with hemolytic anemia ( two cases). Ceruloplasmin levels were abnormal in 37 of 43 cases tested, but normal in six (14%), who showed high basal and post-penicillamine-induced urinary copper excretion and increased hepatic copper. Urinary copper concentration was pathologic in 35 of 42 cases tested (83%), but normal in seven patients under the age of six. Hepatic copper levels were very high in all 20 patients tested. Under treatment, 27 children had a favorable outcome. One patient showed no disease development, seven patients deteriorated due to non-compliance with therapy (one successfully underwent liver transplantation) or severe side effects. Five patients who failed died. CONCLUSIONS: Wilson's disease in children can have a wide clinical spectrum, but liver involvement is by far the most common. Early diagnosis, based on clinical suspicion and the results of copper metabolism studies (including determination of hepatic copper levels in difficult cases), and appropriate treatment can prevent disease progression.",,"Giacchino, R.;Marazzi, M.

577,Clinical healing effect of dimercaptosuccinic acid on hepatolenticular degeneration and the effect of DMSA on biliary trace elements,"OBJECTIVE: To observe bile copper content of non-hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD) controls and changes in trace elements in bile, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine of patients with hepatolenticular degeneration before and after treatment with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) to further explore this etiological mechanism of HLD and demonstrate the therapeutic effect of DMSA in HLD patients. METHODS: A consecutive series of 20 patients with HLD received DMSA orally for 4 weeks. The adult dosage was 1.5 g/day and the pediatric dosage was 1.0 g/day. Their bile, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine samples were obtained by duodenal drainage and lumbar puncture before and after treatment with DMSA. Bile duct samples from 22 non-HLD controls were collected through a drainage tube after surgery. Hitachi 208 atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to analyze the copper, zinc and iron content of each sample. RESULTS: DMSA was effective in improving symptoms such as dysphasia, salivation, dysphagia and skin darkening; Limb tremors and myotonia came second; but it showed no apparent effect on dysstasia, limb contracture and deformity, and hepatosplenomegaly. It was effective in younger patients who had no obvious liver damage. No serious side effects were observed during the course of treatment. Laboratory studies showed that the bile copper content of HLD patients was apparently lower than that of non-HLD controls (P<0.01); In addition to the significant increase in urinary copper excretion (P < 0.01), DMSA was shown to improve biliary copper excretion and had nothing to do with biliary zinc excretion (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The biliary copper excretion disorder is directly involved in the pathophysiology of copper retention in HLD patients. DMSA is a beneficial cupuretic for patients with HLD.",,"Ren, M.;Yang, R.",1997,Sep,,0,0,
578,"Expression, purification, and metal-binding properties of the N-terminal domain of the putative Wilson disease copper-transporting ATPase (ATP7B).","The putative copper-binding domain of the copper-transporting ATPase involved in Wilson's disease (ATP7B) was expressed and purified as a fusion with glutathione-S-transferase. Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography showed that the fusion protein is able to bind to columns loaded with different transition metals with different affinities as follows: Cu(II)>>Zn(II)>Ni(II)>Co(II). ). The fusion protein did not bind to columns loaded with Fe(II) or Fe(III). 65Zinc(II) blotting analysis showed that the domain is able to bind Zn(II) over a pH range of 6.5 to 9.0. Competition 65Zn(II) blotting showed that Cd(II), Hg(II), Au(III), and Fe(III) at comparable concentrations can successfully compete with Zn(II) for binding to the domain. In contrast, the domain had little or no affinity for Ca(II), Mg(II), Mn(II), and Ni(II) relative to copper. Neutron activation analysis of the domain-bound copper showed a copper:protein ratio of 6.5-7.3:1. Both Cu(II) and Cu(I) were found to have higher affinity for the domain compared to Zn(II). Furthermore, a sharp, reproducible transition was observed only in competition experiments with copper, which may indicate that copper binding exhibits some degree of cooperativity.",,"DiDonato, M.;Narindrasorasak, S.;Forbes, J.

579,Penicillamine-associated neurological syndrome in a child affected by Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation,OBJECTIVES: To describe a case of penicillamine-related neurological symptoms in a 9-year-old boy afflicted with asymptomatic Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation; to compare this case with similar cases in adults; and to discuss the role of zinc therapy as an alternative treatment for patients who have an adverse reaction to penicillamine therapy. SETTING: Reference hospital. Main outcome measures: The onset of a neurological syndrome that severely interfered with a child's usual daily activities and health-related quality of life after initiation of penicillamine therapy. RESULTS: Initial penicillamine therapy was chronologically associated with the development of progressive neurological deterioration in the absence of other causes of the neurological syndrome. Discontinuation of penicillamine therapy and initiation of zinc therapy was followed by an immediate resolution of neurological symptoms and a return to baseline neurological status. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillamine therapy can induce neurological symptoms even in children affected by Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation alone and without neurological disease at the start of treatment. Zinc therapy may be a satisfactory alternative.,,"Porzio, S.;Iorio, R.;Vajro, P.;Pensati, P.;Vegnente, A.",1997,Sep,,0,0,
580,Metabolism of administered triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride in man,"Triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (triene-2-HCl) has been used to treat Wilson's disease, which is characterized by the accumulation of copper in various organs. We previously developed an HPLC system to analyze triene and found a triene metabolite in urine when triene was orally administered to humans. In this study, the metabolite was identified as 1-N-acetyltriethylenetetramine (acetyltriene) by FAB-MS and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Triene and acetyltriene could combine with copper, iron and zinc. However, the chelating activity of acetyltriene was significantly lower than that of triene. When triene was administered to healthy adults, the amount of triene excreted in urine was about 1% of the administered triene, while that of acetyl triene was about 8%. Most of the triene was cleared within the first 6 hours after administration, while acetyl triene was cleared over 26 hours. Urinary copper, iron, and zinc levels all increased in parallel with triene excretion.",,"Kodama, H.;Murata, Y.;Iitsuka, T.;Abe, T.",1997,,,0,0,
581,Penicillamine-induced degenerative dermatoses: report of a case and brief review of such dermatoses,"We describe a case of elastosis perforans serpiginosa with additional findings of degenerative skin changes. A 20-year-old man with hepatolenticular degeneration presented with a circular or serpiginous array of nuchal papules on prolonged treatment with D-penicillamine. Histopathologically, transepidermal channels were accompanied by granulomatous reactions, with multiple giant cells engulfing elastic fibers. In addition to these findings of a typical elastosis perforans serpiginosa, we observed scar-like skin changes within the circular arrangement of the papules. On the scar-like tissue we found electron microscopic evidence of randomly aggregated thin collagen fibers with no tendency to systemic combined bundle formation, which is a characteristic feature of normal collagen fiber formation. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like changes were observed on his neck. Slight thickening of the skin and wrinkles were noted on his armpits and groin. The diagnosis of elastosis perforans serpiginosa does not represent all of the manifestations or pathological backgrounds described above. The skin symptoms described here do not only represent elastosis, but a totally degenerative dermatosis with over-healed collagenosis. Therefore, these dermatoses should be grouped together as one entity, penicillamine-induced degenerative dermatosis. After considering the pathogen background and clinical similarities, we further propose to simplify the penicillamine-induced skin manifestations into three categories: acute sensitivity reactions, bullous dermatoses, and degenerative dermatoses.

They were initially diagnosed as acute hemolytic anemia and were fatal despite intensive medical therapy. The main aim of this report is to emphasize that Wilson's disease must be included in the differential diagnosis of fulminant liver failure in children. Liver transplantation is the only effective treatment for patients with fulminant liver failure, but this procedure is difficult to implement due to insufficient organ donation in Taiwan.

We examined the excretion of total protein, albumin, low molecular weight (LMW) and high molecular weight (HMW) proteins, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), and calcium, and creatinine clearance in 24-hour urine samples from 41 Patients with WD aged 6-37 (mean 17) years who had been treated with D-penicillamine (900 mg/day) for a period of 0-15 (mean 4.5) years. The amount of total protein excreted was significantly increased compared to controls, 39% of patients had total proteinuria with more than two standard deviations from the control mean. The changes in protein excretion were dependent on the duration of treatment. LMW proteinuria was increased almost exclusively in the first 2 years after the start of treatment, indicating early tubular damage. This is supported by an initially high excretion of beta-2-microglobulin, NAG and calcium. Elevated clearance of HMW proteins, including albumin, persisted for prolonged periods, suggesting glomerular damage in some patients possibly related to D-penicillamine use. Creatinine clearance remained approximately within normal limits. We suggest that renal function should be checked regularly in patients with WM.",,"Sozeri, E.;Feist, D.;Ruder, H.;Scharer, K.",1997,Jun,,0,0,
586,Liver transplantation: treatment of choice in hepatic and neurological manifestations of Wilson's disease,"Liver transplantation (LTX) is an approved modality to treat patients with end-stage liver cirrhosis and acute liver failure due to Wilson's disease. Initially, the indication of LTX in Wilson's disease with severe neurological impairment but normal liver function was considered. From 1988 to 1995, 13 of 700 LTXs (1.9%) were performed for Wilson's disease. Indications for LTX were (I) intractable neurological impairment with normal liver function (n=4; including one patient with Child A cirrhosis), (II) fulminant liver failure (n=3), and (III) end-stage liver cirrhosis (n=6) (Child B, n=1; Child C, n=5). There were 8 women and 5 men with a mean age of 27 years (range 15-34 years). All Group I patients required continuous care prior to LTX despite pretreatment with d-penicillamine and zinc. The most common symptoms in these patients were dysphagia (n=4), dysarthria (n=4), tremor (n=4), sialorrhea (n=3), ataxia (n=3), dystonia (n=3), and handwriting difficulties (n=3). All group II patients showed haemolytic anemia. The survival rate was 100% and all patients were doing well after a median follow-up of 32.8 months (range 8-68 months). The postoperative course was without severe infectious and other complications. All Group I patients showed the first signs of improvement for all types of neurological symptoms 4-6 weeks after LTX. One patient was asymptomatic 18 months to 5.5 years after LTX. Two patients with short-term follow-up also showed significant improvement in neurological impairment, but residual symptoms are still present. One patient showed only a slight improvement. We conclude that Wilson's disease can be a good indication for LTX both in neurological manifestations with stable liver function and in hepatic manifestations with cirrhosis or acute liver failure.",,"Schumacher, G.;Platz, K.

Studies on the effect of zinc on lymphocyte function,"Although zinc administration to humans has been reported to impair lymphocyte function, this single report has never been confirmed or disproved. We developed zinc as a lifelong therapy for patients with Wilson's disease. A disturbance in lymphocyte function, which occurs as a side effect of zinc therapy, could lead to serious problems in our patients. We examined the mitogenic response of lymphocytes and natural killer cell activity in patients with Wilson's disease treated with zinc for 5 years or more compared to normal controls and found no differences. In a second study, we examined the same parameters in patients with Wilson's disease before and after one year of zinc therapy and again found no significant differences. We have seen no evidence of immunosuppression or increased susceptibility to infections in our patients who have now been treated with zinc for up to 15 years. We conclude that side effects due to impaired lymphocyte function caused by zinc administration are of no concern in Wilson's disease patients.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Johnson, V.;Kaplan, J.",1997,Jun,,0,1,

In addition, she showed signs of hepatic insufficiency, characterized by a significantly reduced synthetic capacity of the liver but low serum aminotransferase levels and disruption of the proximal renal tubules. If the Coombs test was negative, autoimmune hemolytic anemia was unlikely. Therefore, diagnostic procedures have focused on the cause of liver damage. Increased copper excretion in the urine, greatly increased copper levels in the liver tissue and the detection of a Kayser-Fleischer ring by slit lamp examination confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, which presented clinically only as severe haemolysis.

Patients were prospectively assessed at baseline and at annual intervals for up to 5 years by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and photography, quantitative neurological and speech-language pathology assessments, 24-hour urine copper collection, and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scoring of the brain. The ring size according to Kayser-Fleischer (KF) decreased significantly during the 5-year study period (p < 0.0001). Although the results of neurological examination, speech pathology examination, and 24-hour urinary copper analysis in symptomatic Wilson's disease patients improved during the study period, KF ring regression did not correlate with improvement in these clinical parameters (p > 0, 05). However, there was a correlation between MRI scores and KF ring regression (p=0.02). Anticopper therapy with TM followed by maintenance therapy with zinc is a safe and effective treatment for patients with neurologically symptomatic Wilson's disease. This treatment results in a reduction in KF ring size; However, reduction of the KF ring is not a good predictor of clinical improvement in patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations of Wilson's disease.",,"Esmaeli, B.;Burnstine, M.

592,Treatment of Wilson's disease with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. II. Initial therapy in 33 neurologically affected patients and follow-up with zinc therapy,"AIM: To test the efficacy and toxic effects of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate in the initial treatment of a relatively large number of patients with neurological symptoms and signs caused by Wilson's disease. Two key aspects of effectiveness are preserving the neurological function present at the start of therapy and maximizing the chance of long-term recovery. DESIGN: An open-label study of 33 patients, each treated for 8 weeks, including further follow-up data on the original 17 patients. Neurological function was assessed by frequent quantitative neurological and speech pathological examinations. Several copper-related variables were examined to assess the drug's effect on copper, and several biochemical and clinical variables were examined to assess possible toxic effects. The patients were then followed up at annual intervals, with follow-up periods of 1 to 8 years being indicated. SETTING: A college hospital referral setting. INTERVENTION: Patients were generally treated with tetrathiomolybdate for 8 weeks, followed by maintenance therapy with zinc. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurological function was assessed by quantitative neurological and motor speech studies and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans. RESULTS: During the 8-week administration of tetrathiomolybdate, only 1 of the 33 patients showed deterioration in neurological function. The copper status and possible further toxic effects were generally well controlled quickly. Analysis of the data from individual patients revealed indications of a toxic side effect in only 1 patient, who had reversible anaemia. During the subsequent follow-up period of 1 to 6 years, neurological recovery was good to excellent in most patients. CONCLUSIONS: Tetrathiomolybdate appears to be an excellent form of first line treatment in patients with Wilson's disease presenting with neurological symptoms and signs. Unlike penicillamine therapy, initial treatment with tetrathiomolybdate rarely allows for further, often irreversible, neurological deterioration.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Johnson, V.;Dick, R. D.;Kluin, K.

596,Wilson's disease: genetic basis of copper toxicity and natural history,"The discovery that the Wilson disease gene encodes a copper-transporting ATPase has greatly improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease and of copper metabolism in humans. The abundance of disease-specific mutations and their localization at multiple sites in the genome has limited molecular genetic diagnosis to related known patients and confirms the need for de novo screening using established clinical and biochemical tools. It is uncertain whether the diversity of specific mutations accounts for the broad spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease, and environmental and extragenic factors are likely important contributors. Chelation therapy with penicillamine and trientine remains an effective treatment for most symptomatic hepatic and neurological Wilson's disease. Zinc salts can be used in some asymptomatic patients and OLT in fulminant hepatitis and patients in whom pharmacotherapy is ineffective. The chelating agent tetrathiomolybdate is being studied for the treatment of neurological Wilson's disease. Gene therapy is the new horizon for treatment of Wilson's disease. However, the ability to treat this disorder effectively in this way requires further characterization of the gene product and more efficient methods of gene delivery to all hepatocytes in the liver.

600,Current interpretation of the role of copper in cirrhosis in Indian childhood,"common fatal disease of the past, Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC), which became preventable and treatable in the early 1990s, is rare today. ICC in Indian children must be clearly distinguished from other chronic liver diseases including Wilson's disease. Markedly increased copper concentrations in the liver, urine and serum are characteristic of ICC. These increased concentrations can easily be demonstrated histologically with orcein-rhodanine staining. The uptake of copper from the environment seems to be the most plausible explanation for ICC, as shown by the feeding histories, prevention of ICC in siblings and in Pune district by changing feeding vessels, and the dramatic reduction in the incidence of ICC across India. The nature and role of a second factor in causing ICC remains unclear, although an inherited defect in copper metabolism is strongly suspected. However, ICC does not appear to be a direct early onset of Wilson's disease, since ceruloplasmin is consistently normal and clinical and histological recovery is sustained over the long term despite discontinuation of D-penicillamine therapy. Descriptions of an ICC-like disease in the West suggest that different mechanisms (environmental, genetic, or both) may lead to the same end-stage liver disease: childhood copper-associated cirrhosis. ICC probably represents a specific form of childhood copper-associated cirrhosis that requires high environmental copper intake for its full expression.

At autopsy, the three livers were divided into a large number of samples for a detailed study of the distribution of Fe and Cu, the accumulation of which characterizes the two diseases. Ca, Mg, P, S and Zn concentrations were also determined in the same samples to investigate significant variations or anomalous trends that could help identify these diseases. Our results generally show good agreement with literature data within the limits of sample variability. Based on factor analysis and regression analysis, there is evidence of a high correlation between Fe and P levels in beta thalassemia.

603,Neurological Wilson's disease examined with magnetic resonance imaging and with positron emission tomography using dopaminergic markers,"Four patients with neurological Wilson's disease were examined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). All patients had dystonia as the main clinical manifestation, but also dysarthria and, with disease onset, choreoathetoid movements in at least one limb. A multitracer approach with PET was used to visualize different aspects of dopaminergic function; [11C]-(+)-nomifensin (NMF), [11C]racloprid (RAC) and [11C]-L-DOPA (one patient). Correlation analyzes of RAC and NMF binding and putamen/caudate uptake ratios showed corresponding reductions. The patient examined with [11C]-L-DOPA had a normal striatal uptake. In general, structural changes as shown by MRI corresponded to reductions in both NMF and RAC binding. There was no apparent correspondence between the PET findings and the severity of the clinical symptoms observed in the individual patient. In two patients with discrete neurological impairment at the time of examination, PET showed severe presynaptic dopaminergic lesions in the putamen. Our data suggest that the striatal degeneration seen in Wilson's disease involves a complex pathology involving both afferent and efferent projections. The discrete neurological impairment seen in some patients with gross striatal pathology may be due to concomitant lesions in functionally counteracting basal ganglia circuits.",,"Westermark, K.;Tedroff, J.;Thuomas, K.

607,Formation of hydroxyl radicals from copper ions and hydrogen peroxide: a spin trapping study,"It has been suggested that copper toxicity involves the formation of catalytic hydroxyl radicals (.OH) from hydrogen peroxide. Addition of Cu1+ to a solution containing ethanol or dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO) and the spin-trapping agent alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (4-POBN) leads to the formation of the alpha-hydroxyethyl radical or methyl radical adduct of 4-POBN. Adduct formation was prevented by the inclusion of catalase but not by superoxide dismutase. The inclusion of exogenous H2O2 in the reaction mixture increased the yield of ethanol- or Me2SO-derived radical adducts and also enhanced the formation of secondary radical adducts, including 4-POBN/.H and the methyl radical adduct of 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane. The alpha-hydroxyethyl adduct of 4-POBN is rapidly decomposed in the presence of copper but not iron salts, while the methyl radical adduct is relatively stable in the presence of inorganic copper. The total concentration of the radical adduct detected from the reaction between Cu1+ and H2O2, determined by comparison of the integrated spectral intensity with that of the stable free radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, was only 1–5% of the maximum predicted amount assuming free radical adduct formation from all copper added. A variety of copper chelators inhibit the formation of carbon-centered radical adducts of 4-POBN, including penicillamine and triethylenetetramine, which are the primary drugs used to treat the copper metabolism disorder Wilson's disease. The results provide clear evidence for the formation of hydroxyl radicals from Cu1+ and H2O2 (either added or formed during autoxidation of reduced copper).",,"Gunther, M. R.;Hanna, P. M.;Mason, R.

Psychiatric symptoms are often the first manifestation of the disease and can obscure the diagnosis. Chelation therapy can reverse the fatal outcome of untreated patients, so early detection is crucial.

610,Interactions of zinc and molybdenum with copper in the treatment of Wilson's disease,"We review two recent treatments for Wilson's disease, each using an interaction of a different metal with Cu to achieve therapeutic benefit. The two metals are Zn in the form of the acetate salt and Mo in the form of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TM). Zn, which blocks the absorption of Cu in the intestine by inducing intestinal cell metallothionein, is used for maintenance therapy, treatment of the pre-symptomatic patient from the beginning and treatment of the pregnant patient. TM, which complexes Cu with protein in a three-part complex, is used for the initial treatment of patients with neurological symptoms. [References: 31]",,"Brewer, G. J.",1995,Jan-Feb,,0,0,
611,Plasma copper and antioxidant status in Wilson's disease,"The level of serum copper not bound to ceruloplasmin (loosely bound copper) has been shown to be elevated in Wilson's disease, although total serum copper is usually low, reflecting low ceruloplasmin levels . To assess the contribution of free radical reactions catalyzed by non-ceruloplasmin copper to the development of complications of this disease, we assessed copper and antioxidant status in four untreated patients who had hepatic dysfunction with or without hemolytic anemia, and conducted a comparison involving five patients treated with penicillamine therapy and 19 age-matched healthy children. We found that loosely bound plasma copper, as measured by the phenanthroline assay, was detectable in three out of four untreated Wilson's disease patients, but was undetectable in the on-therapy patients or in the healthy controls. Among the different antioxidants, ascorbate and urate levels were significantly reduced before treatment (mean +/- SD, 23 +/- 16 micromoles for ascorbate and 90 +/- 59 micromoles for urate) compared to the values in the patients during the treatment with penicillamine (67 +/- 19 and 302 +/- 78 microM, p<0.05) and in control children (60 +/- 8 and 254 +/- 48 microM, p<0.05). We also showed that the plasma concentration of allantoin, an oxidation product of uric acid and a possible marker for the formation of free radicals in vivo, was significantly increased in the untreated patients (11.0 +/- 1.8 vs. 4.3 +/- - 0.5 microM in patients on therapy and 6.5 +/- 0.8 microM in controls, p<0.05).

614,Effect of growth hormone on IGF-I levels in a growth hormone deficient patient with Wilson's disease,"This is a case report of a boy with a combination of two rare conditions: growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and Wilson's disease. To our knowledge, no comparable case has been published in the literature. GHD was diagnosed at 4.5 years of age (height standard deviation score (SDS) -4.85). However, due to a difficult family background, growth hormone (GH) therapy could not be started. The boy was not seen again until the age of 7.7 years (height SDS -4.77) when GHD was reconfirmed and GH therapy could be started (dose 0.6 IU/kg/week). At that time, elevated liver enzymes (GPT 128 U/l, GOT 67 U/l, gamma-GT 28 U/l) confused diagnostic procedures. On GH, the growth rate SDS increased from -1.86 to +4.50 in year one and +3.87 in year two, and the height SDS increased to -4.26 and -3.59. However, serum IGF-I levels did not normalize (max 67 ng/mL) and liver enzymes were still elevated. At the age of 10, Wilson's disease was diagnosed due to a low concentration of serum ceruloplasmin, increased urinary copper excretion, and high copper content in a liver biopsy specimen. Under combined therapy with D-penicillamine and GH, serum liver enzymes decreased and IGF-I levels increased to normal. Altitude SDS for chronological age has steadily improved.",,"Koch, A.;Dorr, H.

616,Long-term treatment of Wilson's disease with triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (trientine),"Long-term treatment with triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (trientine, TETA) was studied in 19 patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Two received the drug as their first choice and 17 after treatment with penicillamine. The change was due to side effects, failure to improve or worsening of neurological symptoms. All penicillamine-induced side effects returned. Thirteen patients continue to receive trientine and the mean overall follow-up time on this treatment is 8.5 years/patient. Seven of the 13 patients are free of symptoms related to WD, five have mild to moderate neurological symptoms, mainly dysarthria. One patient with neurological symptoms who received trientine from the start of treatment deteriorated rapidly and is now severely dystonic. In one patient, symptoms first worsened and later improved. All other patients improved during treatment with trientine. Three patients died: two from multifocal cancer including the liver and one non-complier from ruptured spleen. Two patients underwent liver transplantation because of progressive liver failure: one non-complier and one with cirrhosis whose liver function deteriorated despite treatment; both are now symptom-free. Unexpectedly, two patients developed severe colitis, one also developed duodenitis, which improved after drug discontinuation. No other adverse effects of trientine have been noted.",,"Dahlman, T.;Hartvig, P.;Lofholm, M.;Nordlinder, H.;Loof, L.;Westermark, K.",1995,Sep,,0,0,
617,Wilson's disease: a new gene and an animal model for an old disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. In normal individuals, copper homeostasis is controlled by the balance between the intestinal absorption of dietary copper and the hepatic excretion of excess copper into the bile. In Wilson disease, hepatic copper is neither excreted in the bile nor incorporated into ceruloplasmin, and copper accumulates to toxic levels. The Wilson disease gene (WND) encodes a putative copper-transporting protein that is almost exclusively expressed in the liver. The predicted structure of the protein product is that of a P-type ATPase with notable homology to bacterial copper transporters and the gene product of another inherited disorder of copper metabolism, Menkes disease. A rat model of Wilson's disease was recently identified. The Long-Evans cinnamon (LEC) rat shows increased hepatic copper, defective incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin, and reduced biliary copper excretion. The rat homologue of WND is abnormal in LEC rats. Clinical manifestations of Wilson's disease arise directly from copper-induced damage to hepatocytes (hepatic presentation) or indirectly after the release of copper from the liver with subsequent damage to the brain (neuropsychiatric presentation) and other organs. Genetic heterogeneity (different mutations in a single gene) may account for some of the variability in Wilsonian presentations. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease depends on the demonstration of abnormal copper metabolism, which is manifested by elevated urinary and hepatic copper and low ceruloplasmin levels. However, none of the abnormal findings in Wilson's disease is pathognomonic. Genetic diagnosis is likely difficult in the absence of family studies, as many different mutations lead to the disease. Treatment for Wilson's disease involves reducing excess levels of copper that have accumulated in the liver, brain, and other organs. Copper chelation therapy to increase urinary copper excretion is the mainstay of treatment. In addition, oral zinc therapy may be useful in reducing the absorption of dietary copper and rendering copper non-toxic in tissues by increasing the formation of complexes with copper-binding proteins. Liver transplantation may be necessary in patients with acute liver failure or complications of cirrhosis. Gene therapy may evolve in the future; However, medical treatment is effective in most patients. [References: 121]",,"Cuthbert, J. A.",1995,Aug,,0,0,
618,Diagnosis of Wilson's disease in an asymptomatic sibling by DNA linkage analysis,"The molecular genetic diagnosis of Wilson's disease in the 5-year-old sister of a patient with Wilson's disease is reported. The girl was clinically disease-free and had no conventional biochemical markers of Wilson's disease (ie, normal ceruloplasmin, normal serum copper, normal 24-hour urinary copper excretion). Diagnosis with restriction fragment length polymorphisms and non-radioactive polymerase chain reaction-based analysis with microsatellite markers showed that she was homozygous for the disease-associated markers. A liver biopsy was performed and a 20-fold increase in liver copper confirmed the diagnosis. The child was treated with chelation therapy with D-penicillamine. The report of this study clearly demonstrates the advantage of DNA linkage analysis (particularly polymerase chain reaction) over traditional laboratory methods for the pre-symptomatic diagnosis of Wilson's disease before irreparable liver and neurological damage occurs. The only limitation of this DNA-based diagnosis is that it is only applicable to siblings of an index patient diagnosed using phenotypic criteria.",,"Maier-Dobersberger, T.;Mannhalter, C.;Rack, S.;Granditsch, G.;Kaserer, K.;Korninger, L.;Steindl, P.;Gangl, A.;Ferenci, P.",1995,Dec,,0,0,

620,Treatment with D-penicillamine improves dopamine D2 receptor binding and T2 signaling intensity in de novo Wilson's disease,"We report the results of striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding in vivo assessed by PET using 11C-raclopride (one patient only) and by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using 123I-iodobenzamide (123I-IBZM ) and the results of T2-weighted MRIs in two de novo patients with Wilson's disease before and 4 months after starting treatment with D-penicillamine. Before treatment, specific 11C-racloprid binding (patient 1 only) was significantly reduced, with a putamen-to-cerebellum ratio of 1.99 (controls: 3.99 +/- 0.55, n=15) and a caudate-to-cerebellum ratio of 2.52 (controls: 3.65 +/- 0.59, n=15). Specific 123I-IBZM binding was decreased in both patients, with a basal ganglia to frontal cortex ratio of 1.25 (patient 1) and 1.41 (patient 2) Controls: 1.57 +/- 0.04, n = 5). After 4 months of therapy, 11C-raclopride PET improved to a putamen-to-cerebellum ratio of 2.52 and a caudate-to-cerebellum ratio of 3.06 (patient 1). 123I-IBZM-SPECT showed an increase in basal ganglia to frontal cortex ratios of 1.34 (patient 1) and 1.55 (patient 2). On heavily T2-weighted MRI sequences, the pre-therapy hyperintense signal changes in the putamen (both patients), brainstem (patient 1 only), and caudate (patient 2 only) had greatly decreased after treatment. Decreased striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding in these Wilson disease patients improved with therapy, suggesting in part a reversible defect in striatal neurons.",,"Schwarz, J.;Antonini, A.;Kraft, E.;Tatsch, K.;Vogl, T.;Kirsch, C.

622,Wilson's disease. Psychiatric manifestations can be the clinical presentation,"It is important to consider Wilson disease in patients with psychiatric signs and symptoms who also have abnormal liver function test results or neurological findings, or both. Thorough evaluation of emotionally disturbed individuals, including a complete history, careful physical examination, and an appropriate laboratory profile, generally rules out or raises suspicion of Wilson disease during routine screening. Laboratory abnormalities require repeat studies and additional family and personal medical history with an emphasis on possible Wilson disease. Further processing may then be indicated. Prompt detection and vigorous, consistent treatment can minimize symptoms and tissue damage. It is gratifying to identify a case of Wilson's disease and to see how the clinical aspects improve with appropriate therapy. [References: 14]",,"Jackson, G. H.;Meyer, A.;Lippmann, S.",1994,Jun,,0,0,
623,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. XIII: Therapy with zinc in pre-symptomatic patients from diagnosis,"The siblings of patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease each have a 25% risk of also developing this autosomal recessive disease. Screening these siblings allows for their identification and initiation of prophylactic therapy before they become clinically ill. Here we report the successful treatment of 13 pre-symptomatic patients with zinc acetate. These patients who received zinc were followed for 3 to 9 years. In well-conforming patients, 24-hour urine copper and non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper levels have decreased over years of follow-up, consistent with the elimination of excess, easily mobilized copper (the potentially toxic copper) from the body. The effect of therapy and compliance can be easily monitored by tracking 24-hour urine zinc and copper levels. The level of copper in the urine is a good reflection of the body's excess load of easily mobilized copper. It increases when control is insufficient. A decrease in urine zinc is an early signal that the patient's compliance is not optimal. Hepatic copper levels may remain the same, decrease, or transiently increase in response to several years of zinc therapy. This is a mirror image of zinc induction of hepatic metallothionein sequestering copper in a non-toxic pool. Hepatic copper levels should not be used to guide therapy. Liver function is well preserved by zinc therapy and no zinc toxicity occurred in these 13 patients. No patient developed symptoms related to Wilson's disease. We conclude that zinc acetate is a fully effective and non-toxic therapy for the prophylactic treatment of patients with pre-symptomatic Wilson's disease.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Dick, R.

624,Treatment of Wilson's disease with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. I. Initial therapy in 17 neurologically affected patients,"OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy and toxicity of a new drug, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, in the initial treatment of a relatively large number of patients with neurological signs and symptoms caused by Wilson's disease. The key aspect of effectiveness was to preserve the neurological function present at the start of therapy. DESIGN: An open-label study with 17 patients, each treated for 8 weeks. Neurological function was assessed by frequent quantitative neurological and speech assessments. Several copper-related variables were examined to assess the drug's effect on copper, and a large number of biochemical and clinical variables were examined to assess potential toxicity. The patients were then followed up at annual intervals, with follow-up periods of 1 to 5 years being indicated. INSTITUTION: A referral to a university hospital INTERVENTION: Patients were generally treated with tetrathiomolybdate for 8 weeks followed by maintenance therapy with zinc. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurological function was assessed by quantitative neurological and linguistic assessments. RESULTS: None of the patients suffered loss of neurological function. The copper status and possible further toxic effects were generally well controlled quickly. No toxic effects resulted from the administration of tetrathiomolybdate. During the subsequent follow-up period of 1 to 5 years, neurological recovery was good to excellent in most patients. CONCLUSIONS: Tetrathiomolybdate appears to be an excellent form of first line treatment in patients with Wilson's disease presenting with neurological signs and symptoms. In contrast to penicillamine therapy, initial treatment with tetrathiomolybdate does not lead to further, often irreversible, neurological deterioration.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Dick, R.

627,Wilson's disease: various hepatic presentations,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Previous Indian studies have highlighted the neurological manifestations of this disorder. Eleven patients with Wilson's disease with various hepatic manifestations are reported. METHODS: Patients referred to the gastroenterology department of a tertiary referral center were evaluated for Wilson disease based on clinical suspicion by slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings, serum ceruloplasmin, and 24-hour urinary copper determination. Liver biopsy was performed whenever possible. RESULTS: Patients with Wilson's disease presented with acute viral hepatitis (n = 5), fulminant hepatic failure (n = 2), subacute hepatic failure (n = 2), and cryptogenic cirrhosis (n = 2). Therapy with penicillamine/trientene and zinc sulfate was started in 9 patients; 5 showed a good response to therapy, one had to be switched to trients due to penicillamine toxicity, two died and one was lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Wilson's disease has variable hepatic presentations and should be suspected in all patients with unexplained liver disease. Any young adult with acute hepatitis or fulminant liver failure who has evidence of underlying chronic liver disease or associated hemolytic anemia should be evaluated for Wilson disease. Therapy with penicillamine or trientene in combination with zinc sulfate shows an improvement in the majority of patients.",,"Gill, H. H.;Shankaran, K.;Desai, H. G.",1994,Jul,,0,1,

630,The diagnostic value of multimodal evoked potentials in Wilson's disease,"19 patients with a neurological manifestation of Wilson's disease (WD), most of them with long-term disease (> 10 years), were examined clinically, psychometrically and electrophysiologically to test whether there is a correlation between psychometric and evoked potential (EP ) Abnormalities with a semi-quantitative clinical score ranging from no (0) to severe (3) symptoms. The following EPs were recorded: auditory evoked event-related (ERPs), somatosensory (SSEPs), visual (VEPs), and brainstem evoked potentials (BSEPs). The results were compared to data from an age- and sex-matched control group. Eighty-nine percent of patients had clinical evidence of basal ganglia dysfunction, 11% oculomotor or cerebellar symptoms, but none of the subjects had clinical evidence of visual pathway impairment. Psychometrically, 100% had mood disorders without significant intellectual decline. In EP recordings, 100% showed ERP, 58.0% SSEP and 53% VEP and BSEP abnormalities. VEP and BSEP measurements did not correlate with clinical score. SSEP (right) and ERP amplitude reduction correlated only weakly with the clinical total score. The only significant correlation was found between the total clinical score and the time-dependent psychometric tests. Thus, in Wilson patients with long-term disease, there is a relatively high percentage of subclinical cerebral impairments that are detectable by ERP recordings, but which do not correlate with the patients' clinical status.",,"Arendt, G.;Hefter, H.;Stremmel, W.;Strohmeyer, G.",1994,Apr-May,,0,0,

Efficacy was assessed using 10-day copper balance and absorption of orally administered 64 copper.

642,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc: XI. Interactions with other anticopper drugs,"Zinc (Zn) is increasingly used to treat Wilson's disease. Some physicians have prescribed Zn in conjunction with other anticopper drugs such as penicillamine or triene, although these drugs could theoretically be antagonistic in action. In addition, patients with Wilson's disease frequently take high doses of vitamin C in conjunction with Zn therapy, and there is evidence of possible interactions between vitamin C, Zn and copper (Cu). Interactions of penicillamine, triene, and vitamin C with Zn have not previously been studied with regard to the possible effects of these agents on the efficacy of Zn in Wilson's disease. Here we examined these interactions in the maintenance phase of therapy, using Cu balance and absorption of orally administered 64Cu as endpoints. We find evidence for probable interactions of penicillamine and triene with Zn; however, the end result in terms of Cu balance is about the same with Zn alone as with Zn plus one of the other agents. Thus, there does not appear to be any benefit to co-administration. We find no demonstrable interaction of Zn and vitamin C on the Cu balance when vitamin C is taken in daily doses of 1000 mg.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V.;Johnson, V.;Dick, R.

643,Acquired sideroblastic anemia during treatment of Wilson's disease with triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride,"We report a case of acquired sideroblastic anemia in a patient treated with triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (TTH) for Wilson's disease. No other cause of acquired sideroblastic anemia was found, and neither iron nor pyridoxine therapy corrected this anemia. In contrast, decreasing the TTH dose resulted in the disappearance of the ringed sideroblasts. Therefore, TTH should be added as an additional cause of secondarily acquired sideroblastic anemia. The pathophysiology of this finding, which is likely related to an abnormality in mitochondrial iron metabolism, is briefly discussed.",,"Condamine, L.;Hermine, O.;Alvin, P.;Levine, M.;Rey, C.;Courtecuisse, V.",1993,Jan,,0,0,
644,Geographical variations in Wilson's disease,"It has been noted that certain characteristics of Wilson's disease (WD) in Asia differ from those found on other continents. The higher prevalence rate in Japan is believed to be due to higher consanguinity. In Chinese, there is a close association between WD and two gene loci for esterase D and retinoblastoma in the long arm of chromosome 13. The high proportion of patients with hepatic presentation explains the early onset of WD in the Japanese and Chinese series. Skeletal involvement, hyperpigmentation of the legs, dark complexion, amenorrhea, epileptic seizures, and cerebral white matter degeneration are relatively more common in WM patients in Asia. Excess copper in the liver appears to have a protective effect against hepatocellular carcinoma and type B hepatitis. Electrophysiological studies suggest widespread CNS dysfunction in WM. Side effects of penicillamine are quite common and often lead to discontinuation of therapy. Triene has been found to be effective with no side effects. Oral zinc therapy may be a suitable alternative for the long-term treatment of WM patients in Asian developing countries. [References: 77]",,"Chu, N. S.;Hung, T. P.",1993,Jul,,0,1,
645,Chelation treatment of neurological Wilson's disease,"The results of chelation treatment in 137 patients with neurological Wilson's disease are described together with the more commonly observed toxic reactions to the various drugs used. 57 patients responded excellently to treatment and became symptom free. Thirty-six patients made a good recovery but were left with some minor neurological deficits. 24 patients responded poorly: although the disease process was stopped, they remained more or less disabled. Twenty patients died: nine received little or no treatment, but eleven died despite apparently adequate chelation therapy. There was no apparent reason for this failure. The liver copper level was determined in six of these patients: only in one was it still significantly elevated, but in all four in which determination was possible, the copper concentration in the basal ganglia was above 45 micrograms/g wet weight. It was not apparent why adequate therapy failed to remove the copper from the brains of these patients. There was no obvious clinical, histological, or biochemical indicator of non-response to treatment. An initial deterioration before improvement was observed in 30 patients: the prognosis for a useful recovery was not necessarily worse than in patients who did not show this phenomenon.",,"Walshe, J.

648,Does a vegetarian diet control Wilson's disease?,"The literature indicates that copper (Cu) is less bioavailable in a vegetarian diet than in a mixed diet. In addition, several groups, including ours, find a rather marginal average Cu intake in the typical American diet. For example, our data show that patients with Wilson's disease consume only about 25% more Cu than is required on a typical American diet. This suggests that if a vegetarian diet reduces bioavailability by approximately 25% or more, it would be appropriate maintenance therapy for Wilson's disease. Observations in two of our patients who voluntarily ate a lacto-vegetarian diet and who almost completely failed to comply with anti-Cu therapy support this view. These observations suggest that a vegetarian diet could be a tool in treating Wilson's disease. They also emphasize the marginal Cu intake in the American diet and suggest that some apparently healthy people, particularly vegetarians, may be at risk of mild Cu deficiency.",,"Brewer, G.

651,Wilson's disease: A diagnosis made in two people over the age of 40,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that is widely recognized as a disorder that occurs clinically in children, adolescents, and young adults. It is believed that unrecognized and therefore untreated Wilson's disease is either rare or absent in patients over 40 years of age. Two cases of Wilson's disease presenting after the age of 40 are presented. The first is a 42-year-old Israeli woman who presented with fulminant liver failure. Serological and biochemical tests performed at the time of her fulminant liver failure included copper tests, which suggested the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, which was confirmed by examination of the native liver after successful orthotopic liver transplantation. The second case is that of a 56-year-old white male who presented to the hospital with a three-year history of neurological dysfunction, pancytopenia, and mild splenomegaly. A series of serological and biochemical tests indicated the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by hepatic copper quantification and detection of Wilson's disease in three of his siblings, all of whom were diagnosed after the subject's case was identified. This man and his siblings were treated with D-penicillamine, which resulted in a remarkable improvement in their neurological and hepatic function. The subject is currently doing well, 11 years after his diagnosis. These two cases demonstrate that the diagnosis of Wilson's disease should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis of persons in their fourth and fifth decades of life with unexplained liver disease.",,"Bellary, S.

We developed a simple fluorometric method for the detection of TETA in biological fluids using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and analyzed serum and urinary TETA concentrations in two healthy adults who received TETA orally. No TETA peak was detected in the serum. The amount of TETA in the urine of the two adults was only 1.6% and 1.7% of the administered dose, respectively. However, after oral administration, a large, unidentified peak occurred in urine. This peak was not observed in a mixture of TETA and control urine or in urine prior to TETA administration. When the urine after TETA administration was analyzed after hydrolysis with HCl, the unidentified peak disappeared while the TETA peak increased. These findings indicate that the substance that gave rise to the unidentified peak is a metabolite of TETA, suggesting that most of the TETA administered is metabolized and then excreted in the urine.",,"Kodama, H.;Meguro, Y.;Tsunakawa, A.;Nakazato, Y.;Abe, T.;Murakita, H.",1993,Jan,,0,0,

At family screening, an additional three asymptomatic patients were identified as affected. Five of the symptomatic patients had clinical features of liver disease at presentation and one patient had preceded renal dysfunction. The remaining patient presented with neurological features. Six patients had a Kayser-Fleisher ring. Abnormal liver function tests were found in half of the patients. Ceruloplasmin was reduced in 7 out of 10 patients. Serum copper and urine copper determinations have been the most useful diagnostic laboratory tests. Morphological changes were found in all 9 patients who had percutaneous liver biopsy. All patients were initially treated with D-penicillamine and clinical responses were noted in seven, one of whom developed neurological manifestations during treatment. D-penicillamine was replaced with zinc sulfate in 3 patients who developed thrombocytopenia. The data suggest that Wilson's disease may not be uncommon in Saudi Arabia. For early detection and prompt treatment, the disease should be suspected in appropriate clinical circumstances, particularly in young patients with liver disease.

Sixteen patients (8 males and 8 females) ranging in age from 11 to 50 years and disease duration ranging from 5 months to 32 years underwent MRI in a 1.5 T system. Four patients were asymptomatic, 4 had mild neurologic findings, 2 were moderately affected, and the remaining 6 had severe disease. All patients were receiving D-penicillamine at the time of the study. The most symptomatic patients showed five or more sites of abnormality on MRI. The putamen was affected in all symptomatic subjects and one asymptomatic and 11 of them had dystonia on neurological examination. The peripheral localization of putaminal hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images was striking. In eight cases, striatal or substantia nigra lesions explained the parkinsonism observed on neurological examination.

657,Wilson disease,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Advances have been made in pinpointing the gene's position on the long arm of chromosome 13 and in finding nearby probes that can be used to identify affected siblings of newly diagnosed patients. However, the gene has not been cloned and the molecular nature of the defect remains unknown. The cause of the disease is a failure to excrete unnecessary and excess copper in the bile, resulting in its loss in the stool. This may be due to copper packaged in ceruloplasmin not being excreted in the bile. Clinically, patients usually present in their second to fourth decades of life with hepatic, neurological, or psychiatric disorders, but diagnosis is often missed or delayed. Once a diagnosis of Wilson's disease is contemplated, reliable studies of copper variables can be conducted. Once diagnosed, patients must receive anticopper treatment for the rest of their lives to lower copper levels and prevent copper from re-accumulating. For lifelong maintenance therapy, we recommend zinc acetate for its complete efficacy and lack of toxicity; it works by blocking copper uptake. No currently available therapy has proven to be optimal for the initial therapy of acutely ill patients. A chelate-type drug, either penicillamine or triene, can be used for the initial therapy of patients with liver disease; After a few months, you can then switch to zinc acetate. In the initial therapy of acutely ill patients with neurological diseases, chelation should be avoided, since neurological deterioration often occurs, probably due to a redistribution of copper that transiently increases the copper level in the brain. Zinc therapy is also not ideal for initial treatment, as it is relatively sluggish. A new experimental drug, tetrathiomolybdate, shows promise for the initial treatment of patients with Wilson's disease. Key future challenges include closing the remaining therapeutic gaps, cloning and expressing the gene to understand its function, and improving clinical diagnosis so therapy can be initiated as quickly as possible.

659,Strategies for developing new antiarthritic drugs,"Therapeutic advances in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have largely focused on the development of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with improved properties compared to aspirin [Brooks & Day, New Engl. J. Med., 324, 1716-1725 (1991 )]. For example, greater efficacy, safety, improved tolerability in the elderly, and reduced dosing frequency have been achieved. However, these agents are generally regarded as a palliative treatment for the symptoms of the disease. The development of disease-modifying drugs (DMDs), also known as second-line drugs, for RA has not been very successful. Most of the drugs currently used in this category were originally used to treat other diseases such as malignancies (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate), Wilson's disease (d-penicillamine), and tuberculosis (gold salts) [Pullar, Br. J. clin . Pharmac., 30 , 501-510 (1990)]. Unfortunately, neither remedy is ideal, and each has potentially serious side effects. Several attempts have been made to develop agents with new mechanisms of action that will hopefully greatly improve on current therapies. [References: 47]",,"Lewis, A. J.;Glaser, K. B.;Sturm, R.

660,Wilson's disease: current status,"OBJECTIVE: To review current concepts on the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and treatment of Wilson's disease, with an emphasis on recent developments. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Published information was identified using MEDLINE and through extensive manual searches of bibliographies in identified sources. RESULTS: The basic biochemical alteration responsible for the impaired hepatobiliary copper homeostasis in Wilson's disease remains to be identified. The gene for Wilson's disease has been mapped to chromosome 13, but the function of its gene product has not yet been determined. The clinical manifestations of Wilson's disease are diverse and often nonspecific, and include a range of hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric findings. Penicillamine remains the drug of choice for treating Wilson's disease, but recent experience suggests that trientine and zinc may be safe and effective alternatives. All three drugs are probably safe for use in pregnant Wilson's disease patients. Liver transplantation is the only effective treatment for Wilson's fulminant liver failure and corrects the underlying metabolic defect. CONCLUSIONS: Wilson's disease is a disorder of hepatobiliary copper excretion, which is predominantly manifested by hepatic and neurological copper toxicosis and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Although the specific underlying biochemical defect has yet to be defined, specific therapy is available and usually successful. Maintaining a high index of suspicion is critical to diagnosing this easily treatable inherited disorder. [References: 167]",,"Yarze, J. C.;Martin, P.;Munoz, S. J.;Friedman, L. S.",1992,Jun,,0,0,

663,The interactions of penicillamine with copper in vivo and the effect on hepatic metallothionein levels and copper/zinc distribution: the implications for Wilson's disease and arthritis therapy,"D-penicillamine does not remove copper from metallothionein, but has been suggested to increase hepatic metallothionein levels. D-penicillamine has been shown to increase hepatic metallothionein levels in rats; however, the effect was dependent on an interaction with copper. The drug accelerated the excretion of exogenous copper but increased the amount retained on metallothionein. This interaction of penicillamine and copper also led to changes in the zinc distribution and in particular to an increase in the heat-stable cytosol zinc fraction. In contrast, thiomolybdates were much more effective at removing exogenous copper and even removed copper already bound to metallothionein; thus, the copper content in the heat-stable cytosol fraction decreased. The observations support the view that patients with Wilson's disease may not actually be ""decoppered,"" but that treatment with d-penicillamine is effective because the copper accumulated in the liver is bound in a nontoxic form by the elevated metallothionein. The results explain why stopping treatment is dangerous. The results may also partially explain the effectiveness of D-penicillamine copper chelates as anti-inflammatory drugs.",,"McQuaid, A.;Lamand, M.;Mason, J.",1992,Jun,,0,0,

This is a report of a patient with cystinuria on long-term high-dose penicillamine who developed Pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like lesions. Merging yellow papules with a ""chicken plucked skin"" appearance were seen in the armpits and neck, while redundant skin folds were noted in the anterior axillary line and lower buttocks.

Seventeen had Wilson disease, 22 had autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, 6 had primary sclerosing cholangitis, 12 had chronic liver disease of various etiologies, 4 had cryptogenic acute liver failure, 6 had acute liver disease, and 8 had a variety of diseases with normal Liver histology appearance. Serum ceruloplasmin and total copper levels were significantly lower in patients with Wilson's disease compared to all other groups, but three children with Wilson's disease had normal ceruloplasmin levels and seven had normal total copper levels. No significant difference was found between the patients with Wilson's disease and the other groups for serum free copper levels and liver copper content. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion at baseline was significantly higher in patients with Wilson's disease compared to the other patients, but six children with Wilson's disease had values just above the upper limit of normal, which overlapped with values found in three children with liver failure, two with acute hepatitis, two with chronic active autoimmune hepatitis, and three with primary sclerosing cholangitis. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion after penicillamine challenge proved to be the single most accurate diagnostic test; Levels greater than 25 μmol/24 h were present in 15 of 17 patients with Wilson's disease, but only in 1 of 58 children with liver failure with other diseases.",,"Martins da Costa, C.;Baldwin, D.;Portmann, B.;Lolin, Y.;Mowat, A.

666,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc: X. Intestinal metallothionein induction,"Oral zinc therapy is effective in controlling copper balance in patients with Wilson's disease and blocks intestinal absorption of copper, as demonstrated by copper 64 intake and copper balance measurements. In this study, 64Cu uptake measurements were performed concurrently with gut biopsies to investigate the relationship between decreased copper absorption and gut metallothionein levels in Wilson's disease patients at different stages of zinc therapy. A significant increase in intestinal metallothionein levels and a sharp decrease in 64Cu absorption were observed 4 to 5 days after the start of zinc treatment. Conversely, metallothionein levels decreased and 64Cu uptake increased after zinc therapy was discontinued. The data show that 64Cu absorption varies as a function of gut metallothionein levels. Gut metallothionein levels have been found to linearly correlate with urinary zinc levels, which reflect the body's zinc status. These findings support our hypothesis that intestinal metallothionein induction mediates decreased copper absorption observed during zinc therapy. The suppressive effect of zinc on copper absorption appears to have a half-life of about 11 days.",,"Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V.;Grider, A.;Nostrant, T.;Cousins, R. J.;Brewer, G. J.",1992,Sep,,0,0,

DP was discontinued and zinc sulfate (220 mg three times a day) was introduced. Under this therapeutic regimen, his renal laboratory parameters returned to previous levels after one month. Within a year of this therapeutic scheme, neurological manifestations were resolved. After 31 months of zinc treatment, he remains neurologically asymptomatic and his renal function is satisfactory.

673,Assessment of portal hypertension: understanding improves treatment,"It may be disappointing to many people that there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the assessment of PHT. Only a few findings such as increased WHVPG and varicose veins support PHT. However, we have gained significant insights. PHT is the result of a series of changes affecting intrahepatic and extrahepatic circulation. Alcohol, viruses, and drugs can disrupt parenchymal architecture and cause cell swelling, collagen and fibrin deposition, and inflammatory cell invasion. These processes can eventually develop into cirrhosis. Although parenchymal dysfunction per se may be responsible for PHT in the early stages, progressively impaired liver function leads to metabolic changes that cause altered hemodynamics. Advanced PHT in parenchymal liver disease is the result of the complex interaction between local and systemic changes. The current techniques for assessing PHT are useful for the qualitative aspects: pressure rise can be assessed directly or indirectly; the portal vein system can also be visualized without arteriography. Gastroscopy remains a standard method for diagnosing PHT. Ultrasound endoscopy is particularly useful to confirm fundal varices and assess changes after sclerotherapy. Increasingly, non-invasive methods for quantifying PHT are available, such as B. the duplex scanner. However, limitations and pitfalls must be recognized. Quantitative assessment remains (still?) a technique for research centers. It is obvious that the general practitioner can do without most of the more sophisticated techniques discussed here. At present, PHT and in particular variceal bleeding is most commonly treated with endoscopic sclerotherapy. For this reason, very detailed studies are only required in a minority of cases. However, the increasing knowledge opens up new perspectives for the treatment and prevention of PHT at different levels. These can be fairly specific treatments for parenchymal liver disease (virals, D-penicillamine for Wilson's disease or bloodletting for hemochromatosis), drugs that can reduce local tissue damage through more general pathways (colchicine, steroids), and drugs that affect blood flow, act. No doubt a more selective portal pressure blocker will become available one of these years. Optimal assessment for this type of therapy makes it imperative to master at least some more advanced techniques. Action can be taken in relation to non-cirrhotic PHT, with causes ranging from congenital or acquired coagulation disorders to anatomical malformations (esophageal tissue) and “natural healthy herbal tea”. It is clear that an adequate diagnostic work-up is required before treating any of the rarer causes.",,"van Leeuwen, D. J.",1991,,,0,0,

Treated patients received D-penicillamine or trientine for a total of 264 patient-years (median 14 patient-years). Abnormal water retention for which salt restriction and diuretics were added to penicillamine or trientine resolved in all but one of the affected patients.

678,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. IX: Reaction of serum lipids,"Zinc therapy for Wilson's disease is a lifelong treatment to prevent copper accumulation. Previous reports have shown that zinc supplementation reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in normal male subjects. This finding raises the possibility that lifelong zinc therapy might be atherogenic. In the present work, the effect of zinc therapy on serum lipids over a period of years in patients with Wilson's disease is investigated. Zinc therapy lowers total cholesterol by about 10% in both sexes and lowers high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by about 20% in male patients. The mechanisms of these interesting effects of zinc on cholesterol metabolism are unknown. The risk factor for coronary heart disease is not significantly changed by zinc therapy in either sex and remains below average in these patients even after zinc therapy. We conclude that zinc therapy in Wilson's disease is not atherogenic.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V.;Johnson, V.",1991,Nov,,0,0,
679,"Wilson's disease: clinical presentation, treatment, and survival","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic features, clinical course, and long-term overall survival of patients with Wilson's disease. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study with a mean follow-up of 14.2 years. SETTING: A university hospital and community hospital. PATIENTS: Between 1957 and 1989, 51 consecutive patients with Wilson's disease were studied. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with D-penicillamine (600 to 1800 mg/day). Two patients with end-stage liver disease had liver transplantation. MAIN RESULTS: First symptoms appeared at a mean age of 15.5 years. At diagnosis, the most common neurological symptoms were dysarthria, tremor, difficulty writing, and ataxia, followed by salivation and headache. Somatic symptoms included abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, liver cirrhosis, and thrombocytopenia. The mean serum concentrations of ceruloplasmin and copper were 44 mg/L and 4.7 mumol/L, respectively. The mean basal urinary copper excretion was 5.5 µmol/day and the mean copper concentration in the liver was 19.6 µmol/g dry weight. The level of free serum copper (mean 2.7 µmol/L) was a reliable predictor of disease and useful in assessing the efficacy of therapy (values below 1.6 µmol/L). Treatment with D-penicillamine improved most hematological and neurological abnormalities, but had little effect on hepatomegaly and splenomegaly and did not reverse cirrhosis. Two patients died of fulminant liver failure during the observation period, while two others with end-stage liver disease had successful liver transplantation and remained asymptomatic. Long-term survival of patients with Wilson's disease was similar to that of age- and sex-matched controls. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that long-term treatment of Wilson's disease patients with D-penicillamine can relieve symptoms and improve prognosis.",,"Stremmel, W.;Meyerrose, K.

Before treatment, urinary copper excretion (UCE) was 70-96 micrograms/day. UCE increased to 1512-2352 micrograms/day on the day of initial administration and remained at values between 350-1100 micrograms/day thereafter. During the 2-month Trien therapy, the neurological deficits regressed in three patients and only slightly in one patient. No side effects were observed. These results and the retrospective survey of 17 patients treated with D-PC confirmed that triene is less effective but a safer copper chelator than D-PC. The transient worsening of neurological deficits observed in two patients in the initial phase of treatment suggested that triene as a D-PC should be started in small doses and increased gradually.",,"Saito, H.;Watanabe, K.;Sahara, M.;Mochizuki, R.;Edo, K.;Ohyama, Y.",1991,May,,0,1,

687,Pathophysiology and treatment of Wilson's disease,"The pathophysiology, symptomatology and treatment of Wilson's disease are reviewed and new approaches to drug management are discussed. Wilson's disease is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder that occurs between the ages of 6 and 60 years. Disorders in copper metabolism can lead to accumulation of excess copper in the liver, the brain's basal ganglia (lenticular degeneration), the kidneys, the cornea (Kayser-Fleischer rings), and other tissues. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease is often overlooked; Nonspecific symptoms and multisystem involvement may mimic other disease states, such as B. neurological and psychiatric disorders and hemolytic anemia. Screening tests for Wilson disease include 24-hour urinary copper levels, serum ceruloplasmin and copper assays, radioactive uptake of 64 Cu, and liver biopsy. Current therapy methods include the use of a chelating agent - penicillamine or trientine - for initial rapid decopping. Penicillamine therapy has been associated with many side effects, including worsening of the patient's neurological symptoms. Zinc is a useful maintenance therapy agent. Investigative studies investigating the use of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate for initial rapid decoppering have shown promising results. If not recognized and treated, Wilson disease can cause severe symptoms and eventually death. Initial rapid decoppering with chelating agents such as penicillamine and trientine, followed by lifelong maintenance therapy with zinc is the current treatment modality.

704,Use of Zinc-Copper Metabolic Interactions in the Treatment of Wilson's Disease,"Zinc acetate is emerging as a well-established therapy for treating Wilson's disease. It is excellent for maintenance therapy and for treating the pre-symptomatic patient. Current findings indicate that it is also excellently suited for the treatment of pregnant patients. Zinc works by inducing metallothionein in the intestinal cells, which binds copper with high affinity, blocking its absorption and causing its excretion in the stool. We have shown that zinc, even in doses as low as 25 mg daily, negatively affects copper balance. Zinc, at doses of 50 mg three times daily with all doses separated from food, controls abnormal positive copper balance, blocks uptake of orally administered 64Cu, controls urinary and plasma copper, prevents reaccumulation of hepatic copper, and prevents development or progression of symptoms of copper toxicosis in patients with Wilson's disease. Zinc acetate is expected to be approved for the treatment of Wilson's disease in the near future. We recommend that physicians use urinary and plasma copper and urinary zinc as the primary monitoring tools. In contrast to the comfortable situation with maintenance therapy, the initial treatment of acutely ill Wilson's disease patients is not well thought out. Patients with neurological disorders often deteriorate initially on penicillamine, and zinc acts more slowly than ideal. To this end, we have initiated studies on tetrathiomolybdate. Studies of bile secretions from normal subjects suggest that they excrete regulatory (excess) copper packaged in a protease-resistant fragment of ceruloplasmin. This fragment is absent in the bile of Wilson's disease. The gene for Wilson disease is located on chromosome 13, near the retinoblastoma locus.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V.;Lee, D.

706,"Hepatic copper concentration in Wilson's disease: effect of treatment with ""anti-copper"" agents","Serial determinations of copper were carried out on the livers of 10 patients with Wilson's disease. Two were studied before and eight after the start of treatment to assess any effect on the concentration of the metal. Copper levels rose in two patients who were not receiving therapy and one patient who had stopped it. In the latter patient, restarting treatment then led to a fall in the level of copper in the liver. A similar decrease was observed in seven patients on continuous therapy. In one patient, a very poor compler, the concentration of copper in the liver tended to increase over a period of 5 years. All three therapies studied—penicillamine, trientine, and tetrathiomolybdate—when taken regularly appear to be effective in lowering liver copper levels. 69 individual determinations of copper in the liver were plotted against the duration of treatment. This shows that the copper concentration drops rapidly in the first year. According to this, there is no linear relationship between the duration of treatment and liver copper. Bad compilers have a higher concentration of copper in the liver than good compilers. Determinations made from different sections of the liver showed that in only one of 19 samples was there an overlap between the near-normal and abnormal ranges. The main mechanism of action of ""anti-copper"" agents in Wilson's disease appears to be the mobilization of copper from the tissues, but a secondary detoxifying effect may come into play later.",,"Gibbs, K.;Walshe, J.

At autopsy, the surface of the liver was smooth. Liver histology showed massive necrosis. There were few remaining scattered hepatocytes in which copper was detected by rhodanine staining. There was no evidence of cirrhosis. The livers of previously reported cases of Wilson's disease accompanied by fulminant hepatic failure were all cirrhotic.

Copper absorption was suppressed, reflected in the blockade of absorption of orally administered copper 64 . 24-hour urine copper and non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper (freely available copper) levels were reduced. Levels of liver-derived serum enzymes were also generally reduced in patients who had elevated levels prior to treatment. Percutaneous liver biopsies were initially performed and repeated in seven patients after 12 to 35 months of zinc therapy. In five of these patients, a second biopsy sample showed higher copper levels than the first. In three of these five, a third biopsy 6 to 23 months after the second revealed liver copper levels that either returned to baseline or were lower. One patient's initial biopsy sample showed active inflammation that resolved with therapy. All biopsies showed histological scarring typical of cirrhosis, which did not appear to change over the course of therapy. We conclude that hepatic copper may transiently increase during early zinc therapy, but that the accumulated copper is sequestered in a nontoxic form. Based on animal studies, we postulate that this sequestered copper is mainly bound to the zinc-induced high levels of hepatic metallothionein. Zinc appears to be a reasonable option for the initial management of patients with Wilson's disease, particularly those with pre-symptomatic disease.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V.;Lee, D.

Report of a case and review of the literature,"Elastosis perforans serpiginosa is a rare complication of D-penicillamine therapy. It has been reported to occur in Wilson's disease and cystinuria, usually after many years of high-dose therapy. We report a case of D-penicillamine-induced serpiginous perforation elastosis with unique clinical features occurring in a 10-year-old child with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis who received only 71 g of drug over 9 months. The case is also unusual because of the short course and low cumulative dose of the drug received and because of calcification of elastic fibers. Calcification of elastic fibers suggests that this case may represent an unusual variant of elastosis perforans serpiginosa or an overlap with pseudoxanthoma elasticum. All reported cases of D-penicillamine-induced elastosis perforans serpiginosa are reviewed and histopathologic and electron microscopic findings are presented. The theoretical mechanisms of action of D-penicillamine on elastic tissue synthesis and morphology are discussed. [References: 18]",,"Sahn, E. E.;Maize, J. C.;Garen, P. D.;Mullins, S. C.;Silver, R.

719,"Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. V. Changes in serum levels of lipase, amylase and alkaline phosphatase in patients with Wilson's disease","We found frequent increases in serum enzymes amylase, lipase, and alkaline phosphatase in patients with Wilson's disease receiving zinc acetate therapy (25 or 50 mg elemental zinc three times a day). Typically, levels are normal before starting zinc therapy, rise to slightly above normal after a few weeks of therapy, and stabilize in the high normal range after about a year of treatment. Very high doses of zinc (800 mg/day) cause an even further increase in serum lipase and amylase without the symptoms of pancreatitis. Pathological studies of the pancreas in a zinc-treated rat model given doses up to 25 times the effective dose in a human, based on milligrams of zinc per kilogram of body weight, show that zinc treatment does not induce lesions in the pancreas . We interpret these findings to mean that prolonged maintenance therapy with zinc in patients with Wilson's disease does not pose a risk of pancreatic damage.",,"Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V.;Brewer, G.

The ceruloplasmin concentrations in the CSF of all patients were almost the same but lower than those of the controls. CSF copper concentrations in patients with no neurological symptoms were within the normal range, 22 +/- 6 ng/mL. In contrast, CSF copper concentrations in patients with neurological symptoms (69-98 ng/mL) were significantly higher than normal values before and at the start of treatment with D-penicillamine; it gradually decreased in response to treatment. These results suggest that the occurrence of neurological manifestations in Wilson's disease is not related to CSF ceruloplasmin concentration. CSF copper concentration in this disease appears to reflect copper accumulation in the brain and may be useful as a marker for monitoring therapy.",,"Kodama, H.;Okabe, I.;Yanagisawa, M.;Nomiyama, H.;Nomiyama, K.;Nose, O.;Kamoshita, S.",1988,Jan-Feb,,0,0,

A diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made and D-penicillamine therapy was initiated. Associated pancreatitis was diagnosed at presentation based on elevated serum amylase and an enlarged pancreas on ultrasound. Subsequently, an 18-month follow-up revealed no abdominal pain, with repeatedly normal serum amylase levels and a normal pancreas on ultrasound. Since abdominal pain at presentation is a common symptom in Wilson's disease, this possibility should be considered in untreated patients. It is concluded that pancreatitis may be associated with Wilson's disease, possibly because of copper deposition in the pancreas, and is likely to respond to copper chelation therapy.",,"Weizman, Z.;Picard, E.;Barki, Y.;Moses, S.",1988,Nov-Dec,,0,0,

Twenty-seven patients were treated with zinc sulfate for a total of 142 patient-years. The drug was administered in doses varying from 300 to 1200 mg/day. Of the 9 patients initially treated with zinc, 8 improved and 1 died of severe cirrhosis. All 8 patients who were placed on zinc following intolerance to penicillamine performed well on zinc therapy. Ten patients were switched to zinc after being first treated with penicillamine without developing signs of intolerance. Of this group, 8 patients were kept on long-term zinc therapy, 2 were switched back to penicillamine due to personal preference. Signs of zinc intolerance were not observed. All patients were on a diet containing approximately 1.2 mg of copper per day. Our experience supports the notion that zinc sulfate is a good choice for treating Wilson's disease: the drug is effective, safe, and cheap.",,"Hoogenraad, T. U.;Van Hattum, J.;Van den Hamer, C.

CSF copper was elevated in all cases, especially in the four cases examined prior to therapy. Two patients were followed up during therapy with chelating agents over a period of 3 years. In case 1, the data and the clinical course are presented in detail: Before the therapy, the daily copper excretion in the urine was increased, this increased during the first treatment phases. The already low serum copper concentration decreased rapidly at the beginning of therapy and remained at a low level during further treatment. In contrast to the serum level, the copper level in the liquor was up to three times the normal range and fell only very slowly with improvement of the clinical symptoms. These findings suggest copper transport from the CNS to the CSF. The copper concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid seems to be a valuable parameter for the diagnosis and therapy monitoring in patients with cerebral manifestations of Wilson's disease.",,"Weisner, B.;Hartard, C.;Dieu, C.",1987,Jun,,0,0,

However, the clinical consequences of abrupt and permanent withdrawal of penicillamine have not been studied. We studied 11 patients who discontinued their own treatment after being successfully treated with penicillamine (1 to 2 g per day) for a period of 3 to 19 years. Eight died from liver decompensation or fulminant hepatitis after a median survival of only 2.6 years. In another 13 patients, penicillamine was discontinued by the doctor because of serious side effects. In these patients, penicillamine was replaced with trientine (1 to 1.5 g per day), a newer chelating agent. All but one of these patients (who was accidentally killed) are alive at the time of this writing, 2 to 15 years later. Our observations suggest that withdrawal of penicillamine in patients with Wilson's disease results in rapid clinical deterioration that is often fatal. Substituting trientine for penicillamine seems to prevent this unfavorable clinical course.",,"Scheinberg, I. H.;Jaffe, M.

To obtain information on the relative rarity or frequency of neurological deterioration at the start of penicillamine therapy, we conducted a retrospective survey in 25 additional patients with Wilson's disease who met criteria for neurological disease and were treated with penicillamine. The answers show that this syndrome occurs frequently, at least from the patient's point of view.

Serial liver biopsies were performed during a 12- to 20-month follow-up period to determine whether copper re-accumulates in the liver during zinc therapy. The mean baseline hepatic copper concentration was 255 micrograms/g dry weight, while the mean after therapy was 239 micrograms. No patient showed hepatic reaccumulation of copper during zinc therapy. Copper balance, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper concentration all demonstrated good copper control during zinc therapy. Hepatic zinc concentrations increased two- to three-fold from baseline values, but no toxicity was observed. Hepatic zinc concentrations appeared to plateau after 12 to 18 months of zinc therapy. We conclude that oral zinc as the sole maintenance therapy in patients with Wilson's disease prevents hepatic copper re-accumulation.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Hill, G. M.;Dick, R. D.;Nostrant, T. T.;Sams, J.

We have used oral zinc as an additional therapeutic approach for Wilson's disease, with copper balance studies being the primary initial assessment of the appropriateness of a particular dose or zinc regimen. We have previously reported that intensive zinc treatment (zinc taken every 4 hours) was effective in controlling copper balance. We have now shown with balance studies that a simplified zinc regimen of 50 mg zinc taken three times a day is effective in controlling copper balance. The preparatory work presented here with other simplified regimes also indicates their effectiveness. These studies expand the copper balance data base for zinc therapy for Wilson's disease and expand the dose range and regimens of zinc that have been shown to control copper balance.",,"Hill, G.

In this article, we report the use of 24-hour urine copper and plasma copper measurements to monitor the effectiveness of maintenance zinc therapy in 30 patients with Wilson's disease. In examples of therapeutic insufficiency such as noncompliance, these values increase. With continued adequate long-term therapy, they remain stable or decrease.

751,Copper and metallothionein distribution in the liver in Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration),"Wilson's disease is a rare inherited disorder of copper (Cu) metabolism characterized by Cu deposition in the liver, brain and cornea. In this study, the levels of metallothionein (MT), Cu and zinc (Zn) in the livers of two patients with Wilson's disease were analyzed. An approximately 50-fold increase in Cu levels over normal controls was observed in both patients (160 and 298 micrograms/g wet tissue). About 73% of the subcellular Cu was present in the cytoplasmic fraction and most of it was associated with MT. Analysis of hepatic MT levels showed a 3-fold increase (863 micrograms/g wet tissue) over human control values (321 micrograms/g wet tissue). The two forms of MT (MT-I and MT-II) were isolated from a liver sample. Both forms contained large amounts of Cu (11 to 12 g atoms/mole), indicating saturation of MT, which had only 2 to 3 g atoms of zinc. The distribution of MT in the hepatocytes was examined using an immunohistochemical method. In tissue sections with minimal tissue damage, there was intense cytoplasmic staining for MT in hepatocytes, whereas both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was found in tissue sections with extensive necrosis and fibrosis. These results suggest that MT is the major hepatic Cu-binding protein in Wilson's disease, that it is present in a Cu-saturated form, and that it is found only in degenerating hepatocytes in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.",,"Nartey, N.

Seven patients on zinc therapy had a significantly and significantly reduced mean intake of 0.79 +/- 1.05% after treatment.

The copper content, determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry in the patient's liver, kidney and brain tissues, was 28-, 38- and 3.5-fold, respectively, compared to that of the control subject, who was 5-year-old girl and died of cerebral palsy. Each tissue was homogenized in 3 volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min to obtain a cytosolic fraction. Sephadex G-75 gel chromatography of Wilson's liver and kidney cytosols showed that most of the increased copper was present as Cu-Thionein (Cu-Th), in contrast to a much lower Cu-Th content in control liver cytosol and at no detectable level of Cu-Th in the cytosol of the control kidney. In addition, Zn-Th was also increased in Wilson's kidney cytosol while decreased in Wilson's liver cytosol. Gel chromatography of Wilson's cerebral cytosol showed that the increased copper was mainly bound to two proteins with an apparent molecular mass of 10 kDa (Cu-BP 1) and 20 kDa (Cu-BP 2), both of which showed no absorbance at 280 nm and were not observed in control cerebral cytosol even after addition of excess copper (50 micrograms/ml) as CuSO4.",,"Sato, M.;Arima, M.",1986,Oct,,0,0,

It was diagnosed in eight children (five boys, three girls) in our institution over 11 years. Presenting symptoms were hepatic in four children, neurological in one and nonspecific in one, while two children were asymptomatic siblings of index patients. The mean age at diagnosis was 8.9 years (range 4.7-11.7 years). Two boys died shortly after diagnosis: one had fulminant liver failure and the other, who had a neurological condition, died of aspiration pneumonia. Six children are well, with resolution of the clinical disease, two to ten years after the start of oral chelation therapy. In all symptomatic patients, the diagnosis was delayed due to the rarity of the disease, its nonspecific early manifestation and a low index of suspicion of the physicians towards the disease.",,"Dorney, S.

As such, EPS appears to be a relatively harmless cutaneous side effect of penicillamine. However, recent literature has suggested that EPS may represent only a superficial manifestation of a more serious penicillamine-induced systemic damage to elastic tissues, particularly involving blood vessels. This is a report from a patient with Wilson's disease who was treated with penicillamine for 14 years. She developed EPS, and histological examination of the skin revealed the characteristic penicillamine-induced ""lumpy-bumpy"" elastic fibers in the dermis. More importantly, non-lesional skin showed the same elastic fiber changes. Of greatest importance was the finding of identical elastic fiber changes in an artery.",,"Price, R. G.;Prentice, R.

Four were asymptomatic siblings. However, at diagnosis, 10 (59%) had features of single liver involvement, 3 (18%) neurological involvement alone, and 4 (27%) a mixed presentation. Family histories were available in 15 patients; 26.9% of the siblings had Wilson's disease. Serum ceruloplasmin was low in 82% of patients. 24-hour urinary copper was measured in 16 patients and was elevated in all. About half of the patients (41%) had evidence of concomitant renal tubular dysfunction with hypouricemia and aminoaciduria. Three patients (18%) had joint involvement at presentation. All 17 patients were treated with penicillamine. Complications from therapy included pemphigus in one and toxic epidermal necrolysis and later lupus-like syndrome in another. Features of clinical improvement included fading of KF rings, improvement in neurological symptoms, and normalization of serum transaminases. One patient developed primary hepatocellular carcinoma 5 years after presentation. Diagnosis was delayed in half of the patients studied.

The compounds are novel enzyme inhibitors in vitro and appear to have been successfully used therapeutically in the treatment of Wilson's disease. While the changes that occur in vivo are complex, they can best be understood as changing the copper affinities of some of the competing ligands, including albumin, leading to a change in the distribution of copper between the different systemic pools and leading to an overall depletion.

The effects of CS2 toxicity observed in viscose workers as well as in experimental animals remarkably resemble the clinical profile of our grain store workers. Use of CS2 explains dysfunction of the peripheral axons, auditory nerve, optic nerve, and extrapyramidal system, as well as altered behavior and cognitive changes. Signs and symptoms in these workers appear to be dose dependent and we find that workers who were weaned from areas where fumigation occurred reported an improvement compared to that of colleagues who continued routine fumigant treatment. was not observed. Likewise, malthouse workers exposed only to grain dust for 3 to 7 years showed minimal symptoms. Although a number of mechanisms for altering neuropsychological function have been proposed, the chelating ability of CS2-derived DDC and its ability to markedly increase copper and zinc in the central nervous system suggest a toxicity mechanism that of copper poisoning as in Wilson's disease and may explain the development of extrapyramidal symptoms in these patients. Chelation of copper may prove therapeutic in CS2 intoxication. It is clear that both basic research and clinical research will be necessary to clarify the questions raised. We applaud the EPA's decision to ban the use of 80/20 fumigants and also methyl bromide, and trust that similar toxic substances will be carefully evaluated before being chosen to replace these earlier toxic agents. We also condemn the technique of reintroducing grain dust into the food chain rather than destroying it, as the dust contains very high levels of fumigant residues. We speculate on the possible role of CS2 and other pesticides in the food chain and the occurrence of Parkinson's symptoms in these patients and the general public.",,"Peters, H. A.;Levine, R.

775,"Mice and humans, metals and mutations","In the past 15 years, several mutations affecting copper and zinc transport in humans and mice have been discovered, joining the long-known disruption of copper transport in Wilson's disease. Menkes disease (classic and mild variant forms) and X-linked Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type IX, X-linked cutis laxa) share features with each other and with the brindle (Mobr) and spotted (Moblo) mouse mutants, respectively. There can be an allelic series of mutants in each species, or two loci can be involved in each. The toxic milk mutant (tx) in the mouse may be homologous to human Wilson's disease. The defect in intestinal zinc absorption in acrodermatitis enteropathica does not yet have a homologue in mice. However, the lethal milk (lm) mutant in the mouse may be homologous to a condition of zinc deficiency that has been described in some low birth weight breastfed infants. Many other genetic defects in copper and zinc transport may await discovery. Conversely, these mutants are valuable in elucidating the normal processes of copper and zinc transport.

776,Genetic disorders of copper metabolism,"There are several known examples of mutations affecting copper homeostasis in humans and animals. Pleiotropic effects are observed when the mutant gene disrupts copper flux. In some cases, the mutation alters the level of a specific copper ligand (enzyme) and the clinical consequences are unique. The two most widely studied genetic diseases in humans are Menkes disease and Wilson disease. Menkes disease is an X-linked fatal condition in which copper accumulates in some organs (gut and kidney) and is low in others (liver and brain). Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder in which, untreated, copper accumulates in the liver and subsequently in the brain and kidneys. Pathophysiological consequences of copper deficiency and toxicity characterize these two diseases. Specific human cuproenzyme mutations include overproduction of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase in Down syndrome, absence of tyrosinase in albinism, inherited mitochondrial myopathy due to a reduction in cytochrome c oxidase, and an altered lysyl oxidase in X-linked forms of cutis laxa and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Mutations that alter copper metabolism are also known in animals. Several murine mutants were examined. The most extensively studied mutants are the speckled mice, particularly the brindle mice, which have a Menkes disease analogous mutation. Another recently described murine mutation is toxic milk (tx), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accumulation of copper in the liver. Two other mutants, Wrinkled and Shivering, were once thought to have abnormal copper metabolism. Recent data have not confirmed this. A mutation in Bedlington terriers has been described that closely resembles Wilson's disease.",,"Prohaska, J. R.",1986,,,0,0,

The history of treatment modalities and a controlled study of penicillamine showed a clear priority of this drug over phenothiazines in eliminating the psychotic features of the disease. The effective dose in this case was over 1650 mg/day. Mental status, as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, was clearly correlated with penicillamine dose.

Copper accumulation is also harmful, causing damage first to the liver and later to the kidneys and brain in Wilson's disease, some Bedlington terriers and toxic dairy mice. Zinc deficiency is observed in acrodermatitis enteropathica and in preterm infants born to women who appear to be secreting milk that is zinc-deficient, as is the case in fatal milk mice.

797,"Clinical, endocrine and biochemical effects of zinc deficiency","The essence of zinc for humans was recognized in the early 1960's. Causes of zinc deficiency include malnutrition, alcoholism, malabsorption, extensive burns, chronic debilitating conditions, chronic kidney disease, certain diuretics, use of chelating agents such as penicillamine in Wilson's disease, and genetic disorders such as acrodermatitis enteropathica and sickle cell anemia. The need for zinc is increased during pregnancy and during the growth phase. The clinical manifestations in severe cases of zinc deficiency included bullous-pustular dermatitis, alopecia, diarrhea, emotional disturbance, weight loss, intercurrent infections, hypogonadism in men, and it is fatal if left untreated. Moderate zinc deficiency is characterized by growth retardation and delayed puberty in adolescents, hypogonadism in males, rough skin, poor appetite, mental lethargy, delayed wound healing, taste disorders, and abnormal dark adaptation. In mild cases of zinc deficiency in humans, we have observed oligospermia, mild weight loss, and hyperammonemia. Zinc is a growth factor. As a result of its deficiency, growth is impaired in many animal species and in humans. Because zinc is required for protein and DNA synthesis and cell division, zinc's growth effects are believed to be related to its effects on protein synthesis. Testicular function is impaired by zinc deficiency in both humans and experimental animals. This action of zinc is at the end-organ level and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is intact in zinc-deficient individuals. Since zinc is closely involved in cell division, its deficiency can affect the size of the testicles and thus their function. In mice, the incidence of degenerated oocytes and hypohaploidy and hyperhaploidy in metaphase II oocytes was increased due to zinc deficiency. Zinc at physiological concentrations reduced prolactin secretion from the pituitary in vitro and it was suggested that this trace element might play a role in the in vivo regulation of prolactin release. Thymopoietin, a hormone required for T-cell maturation, has also been shown to be zinc-dependent. It is clear that zinc can play multiple roles in biochemical and hormonal functions of various endocrine organs. Future research in this area is urgently needed. [References: 78]",,"Prasad, A.

The need for zinc is increased during pregnancy and growth phases. The clinical manifestations in severe cases of zinc deficiency include bullous-pustular dermatitis, alopecia, diarrhea, emotional disorders, weight loss, intercurrent infections, hypogonadism in men; it is deadly if undetected and untreated. Moderate zinc deficiency is characterized by growth retardation and delayed puberty in adolescents, hypogonadism in males, rough skin, poor appetite, mental lethargy, delayed wound healing, taste disorders, and abnormal dark adaptation. In mild cases of zinc deficiency in humans, we have observed oligospermia, mild weight loss, and hyperammonemia. Zinc is a growth factor. Its deficiency affects the growth of many animal species and humans. Since zinc is required for protein and DNA synthesis and for cell division, it is believed that zinc's growth effects are related to its effects on protein synthesis. Whether zinc is required for the metabolism of somatomedin needs to be investigated in the future. Testicular function is impaired by zinc deficiency in both humans and experimental animals. This action of zinc is at the level of the end organs; the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is intact in zinc-deficient individuals. Since zinc is intimately involved in cell division, its deficiency can affect testicle size and thus impair its functions. Zinc is required for the functions of several enzymes and whether it plays an enzymatic role in steroidogenesis is not known at this time. Thymopoeitin, a hormone required for T-cell maturation, has also been shown to be zinc-dependent. Zinc deficiency adversely affects T-cell functions and chemotaxis. Disorders of cell-mediated immune functions are often observed in patients with zinc deficiency. Zinc is beneficial for wound healing in zinc-deficient individuals. In certain zinc-deficient individuals, abnormal taste and abnormal dark adaptation were found to be reversed with zinc supplementation. [References: 74]",,"Prasad, A.

800,Interactions of trace elements: clinical significance,"We examined the interaction of the trace element zinc with copper and lead. In sickle cell anemia, the usual situation is mild to moderate zinc deficiency due to renal zinc loss. Zinc deficiency appears to result in mild copper overload and increased ceruloplasmin levels, likely through increased copper absorption. With zinc therapy, this process is reversed. Pharmacological doses of zinc, when administered at a level that ensures efficacy (without food), usually result in copper deficiency. We took advantage of zinc's copper-depleting properties to develop a new therapy for Wilson's disease. Zinc inhibits the absorption of dietary copper by inducing intestinal metallothionein and inhibits the reabsorption of endogenously secreted copper, thereby producing a negative copper balance in Wilson's disease. Once we are certain that zinc blocks the accumulation of copper in the liver of patients with Wilson's disease, zinc therapy will become available as an approach to treating this deadly disease. Animal literature indicates that zinc protects against lead toxicity when both elements are administered orally, undoubtedly through the intestinal metallothionein mechanism. In preliminary experiments in rats, we could not show that the toxicity of lead entering the body non-orally is affected by oral zinc supplements. [References: 22]",,"Brewer, G. J.;Hill, G.

806,[Myasthenia gravis induced by D-penicillamine in a patient with progressive systemic sclerosis],"The development of autoimmune diseases in some patients treated with D-penicillamine (DPA) suggests that the reported occurrence of a conduction disorder at the neuromuscular junction and the development of reversible myasthenia gravis in rheumatoid disease, progressive systemic sclerosis or Wilson's disease after DPA use are part of a general predisposition to autoimmune diseases associated with DPA therapy. The reported case is an example. DPA-induced myasthenia gravis (MG) is clinically and electrophysiologically similar to spontaneous MG, although ocular signs predominate in the former. Antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor were detected, and thymic hyperplasia was also formed. In relation to the onset of myasthenic manifestations, the duration of treatment with DPA varies from 6 to 10 months. The effect of DPA on the neuromuscular synapse differs from that seen in spontaneous MG. The pathogenesis of DPA-induced MG is still unclear. The chemical properties of DPA allow it to react with many proteins and some modification of proteins can occur, with structural changes in the composition and antigenicity of the collagen fibers. In vitro, DPA causes disruption of acetylcholine receptor bridges to alpha, beta, and gamma subunits with reduction of SS bridges in the gamma subunit. This decreases the high affinity binding and abolishes its positive cooperative system, reducing the SS linkage in the alpha unit near the acetylcholine binding. The interaction between DPA and receptor can induce an antigenic change in the latter, triggering the autoimmune phenomena. The other possibility is that DPA stimulates prostaglandin E-1 synthesis, which can take the allosteric site of the ACh receptor, disrupting neuromuscular junction.",,"Marchiori, P.

Sections frozen with glutaraldehyde were satisfactory for copper, sulfur, and phosphorus. Five patients (one patient with Wilson's disease, one patient with chronic cholestasis, one with chronic hepatitis, and two with asymptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis) had radiographs of copper and sulfur consistent with hepatocellular lysosomes. Second, the sections frozen with glutaraldehyde were used for a study of copper deposits in the patients' livers. There was a significant correlation between copper and sulfur levels in the lysosomes of all patients studied, but no correlation in the rest of the cytoplasm. Zinc was not detected in the lysosomes. Regardless of the copper content in the lysosomes, the ratio of delta copper to phosphorus (w/w) to delta sulfur to phosphorus was 0.60.

The two older cases with neurological presentations showed areas of sparse density in the basal ganglia on pre-treatment CT scans. Slight cortical atrophy and slight enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles were also observed. Chelation therapy led to a significant improvement in neurological symptoms and the disappearance of Kayser-Fleischer rings. The low-density areas of the basal ganglia disappeared. However, cortical atrophy and dilatation of the ventricles were still present. In one asymptomatic girl, cranial CT scans remained normal after chelation therapy. The cranial CT examination is considered to be very helpful both in the diagnosis and in the monitoring of the course of Wilson's disease and also has a prognostic value.",,"Mizutani, N.;Maehara, M.;Negoro, T.;Watanabe, K.",1983,,,0,0,
817,The effect of chelation therapy on the amino aciduria and peptiduria of Wilson's disease,"1. In most cases of untreated Wilson's disease there is excessive excretion of free amino acids and peptides in the urine. Studies in 11 patients have shown that these two abnormalities are greatly improved by two years of standard chelation therapy. 2. The reduction in excretion of both free amino acids and peptides is purely quantitative, there is no significant change in the percentage composition of amino acids, either free or combined, relative to their total urinary excretion. 3. It is argued that the peptiduria of the disease is usually due to a proximal renal tubular reabsorption defect, but in rare cases may be due to excessive bone loss or even a combination of bone and renal tubular disease in the same patient.",,"Asatoor, A.

After stopping the drug, remission occurred. Penicillamine (dimethylcysteine) is a pharmacological agent used in the treatment of Wilson's disease and heavy metal poisoning due to its chelating properties, as well as in cysteinuria due to the formation of soluble disulfide. Over the past 17 years, penicillamine has been increasingly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, although the mechanism of action is still unknown. A large number of adverse reactions have been reported, including less common autoimmune diseases such as drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis and polymyositis. These and other potential side effects have been well reviewed by others (1, 2). To our knowledge, only a few previous cases of dermatomyositis have been reported as a complication of penicillamine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (3, 4, 5).

822,Oral zinc therapy in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an inherited accumulation of copper that is fatal if left untreated. Because penicillamine, the established treatment, is toxic in a significant number of patients, we evaluated the effectiveness of zinc treatment. We induced a negative or neutral copper balance in five out of five patients with Wilson's disease who received no therapy other than zinc. Zinc acetate was administered every 4 hours during the day and the patient was not allowed to eat 1 hour before and 1 hour after each dose. Oral zinc therapy, applied according to our regimen, can now be considered in the management of patients with penicillamine intolerance. However, it is premature to switch patients to zinc therapy if they tolerate penicillamine well. The effectiveness of zinc therapy in initially clearing copper load in acutely ill Wilson's disease patients has not been evaluated.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Hill, G. M.;Prasad, A. S.;Cossack, Z.

823,3 years of continuous oral zinc therapy in 4 patients with Wilson's disease,"There is a competitive relationship between copper and zinc: among other things, it is known that excess zinc in the diet reduces the absorption of copper from the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of oral zinc therapy in 4 patients with Wilson's disease who took zinc as the only drug to influence their copper metabolism over a period of 3 years. Physical examinations, oral 64Cu stress tests, plasma concentrations of copper, zinc and ceruloplasmin, and urinary copper excretion were used to monitor the effect of therapy. The dosages used ranged from 3 x 100 to 3 x 400 mg zinc sulfate per day. The clinical and biochemical results of oral zinc therapy were good in all 4 patients and no toxic side effects were observed. Our conclusion from this study is that oral zinc may well be a low-toxic alternative to D-penicillamine in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Hoogenraad, T. U.;Van den Hamer, C. J.",1983,Jun,,0,0,
824,Biological roles of ionic zinc,"We tentatively conclude from our work that intracellular calcium acts as a second messenger to affect membrane function through activation of calmodulin. This activation, if excessive, leads to pathological phenomena of adhesion and aggregation of the erythrocytes. We have shown that calmodulin inhibitors can prevent some of these calcium-induced abnormalities. Since some of this work involves a very specific anticalmodulin antibody, it seems very likely that calmodulin is involved in the generation of membrane effects. Zinc appears to act at least in part by inhibiting calmodulin action on the membrane. Our work leads us to believe that zinc regulates copper absorption from the gastrointestinal tract in a somewhat complex way. That is, direct zinc-copper antagonism within the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract is insufficient to explain the effects of zinc on inhibition of copper absorption in humans. Our work indicates that tissues must be loaded with zinc before an effect on copper absorption is observed. This creates a delay effect during which zinc administration does not create a negative copper balance. However, after this delaying effect, zinc produced a negative to neutral copper balance in 5 out of 5 Wilson's disease patients studied. Therefore, at this time, we believe that zinc therapy can be offered as an alternative to penicillamine therapy in previously decopperated or not yet symptomatic patients. However, we recommend that this therapy be used only in accordance with the one zinc therapy regimen that we have tested at this time. [References: 35]",,"Brewer, G. J.;Hill, G. M.;Prasad, A.

To define the extent of myocardial degeneration in newly diagnosed or chronically treated Wilson's disease, we reviewed autopsy findings in 9 cases with this condition. We compared our observations to those in 3 control cases selected for comparable age and with liver disease that had no known association with cardiac degeneration. Our results showed cardiac hypertrophy in 5 out of 9 cases of Wilson's disease. In all cases there was evidence of varying degrees of interstitial and replacement fibrosis, intramyocardial small vessel sclerosis and focal inflammatory cell inflammation. One case had AV nodal degeneration and a 15-year-old boy had severe atherosclerosis of the left main coronary artery. Two patients died suddenly, presumably from an arrhythmia; one of these patients had the most pronounced myocardial changes. We could not specifically correlate these changes with tissue copper levels, treatment with D-penicillamine, or the presence of cirrhosis. We conclude that there are clear morphologic abnormalities in the hearts of patients with Wilson's disease consistent with cardiomyopathy. Although the myocardial changes were non-specific, the fact that 2 patients died suddenly suggests the need for a future prospective study of cardiac function in these patients.",,"Factor, S.

834,"Zinc, the brain and behavior","The total content of zinc in the adult human body is on average almost 2 g. That's about half the total iron content and 10 to 15 times the total body copper. In the brain, zinc is the most concentrated metal with iron. The highest zinc levels are found in the hippocampus in synaptic vesicles, boutons, and mossy fibers. Zinc is also found in high concentrations in the choroid of the retina, which is an extension of the brain. Zinc plays an important role in axonal and synaptic transmission and is required for nucleic acid metabolism and brain tubulin growth and phosphorylation. Zinc deficiency has been linked to impaired DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis during brain development. For these reasons, zinc deficiency during pregnancy and lactation has been shown to be associated with many congenital anomalies of the nervous system in offspring. In addition, inadequate zinc levels in children have been associated with reduced learning ability, apathy, lethargy, and mental retardation. Hyperactive children may be deficient in zinc and vitamin B-6 and have excess lead and copper. Alcoholism, schizophrenia, Wilson's disease and Pick's disease are brain disorders that are dynamically related to zinc levels. Zinc has been used successfully to treat Wilson's disease, achrodermatitis enteropathica, and certain types of schizophrenia.",,"Pfeiffer, C. C.;Braverman, E. R.",1982,Apr,,0,0,

Trien has proven to be a safe and highly effective treatment, both for reversing symptoms and for maintaining patients previously successfully de-coppered with penicillamine. There was evidence of depletion of the body's copper stores by triene associated with clinical improvement. In most patients, the toxic symptoms that necessitated a change in therapy were reversed with triene therapy; However, elastosis perforans did not appear to benefit, and two patients with penicillamine-induced systemic lupus erythematosus were not helped by the change. No other toxic signs or symptoms were observed. There was no evidence of teratogenicity in either the animals or the six patients who became pregnant while taking Triene; All six children developed normally.

The findings are described and analyzed with particular reference to their diagnostic and prognostic value in the treatment of this disease. The most common abnormalities were ventricular dilation, 73 percent; cortical atrophy, 63 percent; Brain stem atrophy, 55 percent. Characteristic areas of hypodensity in the basal ganglia regions were present in 45 percent and almost always accompanied by one or more of the other CT anomalies. This combination of findings is considered specific to Wilson's disease in the appropriate clinical context. CT abnormalities were most common and most pronounced in patients with neurologic presentation, only 2 out of 40 had a normal scan. Similar changes were also detected in three quarters of the patients with hepatic presentation and almost half of the pre-symptomatic patients. Nineteen patients were scanned more than once to assess the impact of treatment with penicillamine or triethylenetetramine on the abnormalities initially recorded. Fourteen had basal ganglia hypodensities on initial scanning, and ten of these had moderate to marked improvement in this abnormality in response to therapy. This was accompanied by a significant clinical improvement. Despite the finding of quite severe CT abnormalities in patients with Wilson's disease. indicating significant loss of neurons, patients nevertheless respond well to treatment.

848,Is copper hepatotoxic in primary biliary cirrhosis?,"In primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), hepatic copper retention occurs as a complication of cholestasis. By analogy with Wilson's disease, copper retention in PBC has been suggested to be hepatotoxic and this has been the rationale for the use of D-penicillamine in this disease. The hypothesis that copper is hepatotoxic in PBC has not been tested, and in this study we evaluated the role of hepatic copper retention in the pathogenesis of PBC. Sixty-four patients with PBC were studied. Fifty-four had elevated hepatic copper concentrations. The synthetic function of the liver cells was well preserved. All patients had normal prothrombin times and only two had subnormal serum albumin concentrations. There was no correlation between copper concentrations in the liver and the extent of biochemical (aspartate transaminase) and histologically assessed liver cell damage. Electron microscopy was performed on liver biopsies from five patients with significantly increased copper concentrations in the liver. The ultrastructure of the liver cells was compatible with cholestasis. Liver cells contained electron-dense lysosomes which were shown by x-ray probe microanalysis to contain copper and sulfur. The characteristic organelle changes associated with copper toxicity in Wilson's disease have not been observed. The biochemical, histological, and histochemical differences between PBC complicated by hepatic copper retention and Wilson's disease indicate that there are differences in the management of copper in these disorders. In this study we could not find any evidence that copper plays an important role in the pathogenesis of liver dysfunction in PBC.",,"Epstein, O.;Arborgh, B.;Sagiv, M.;Wroblewski, R.;Scheuer, P.

The fourth patient developed acute rhabdomyolysis within 48 hours of receiving the first dose of the drug. One patient tolerated therapy for 20 weeks, and although her liver copper concentration did not show a significant decrease, aspartate transaminase levels fell and her IgM concentration fell to normal. Triene is an inappropriate copper chelator in primary biliary cirrhosis, although it remains the alternative drug of choice in Wilson's disease.",,"Epstein, O.;Sherlock, S.",1980,Jun,,0,0,

870,Clinical spectrum of Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration),"Fifty-eight patients with Wilson's disease are being studied, of whom 25 symptomatic patients first developed liver disease and 28 brain disease. Ten of these patients had liver disease only, 19 had brain disease only, and 24 had both liver and brain disease. The remaining five were discovered to be asymptomatic siblings of known patients. Three of the patients with hepatic presentation and one with neurological presentation later experienced the other type of symptomatology, bringing the total number of patients with mixed disease to 28. Of the 44 patients with brain disease, 12 had primarily extrapyramidal findings, 6 with cerebellar findings, and 17 with both; pseudobulbar findings were noted in 9 patients, all presenting with other symptoms of severe nervous system disease. In addition to these presentations, in a significant number of patients, the first symptoms were of a mental or emotional disorder. Diseases of other organ systems such as joints and kidneys have also occurred rarely. Where sufficient family information was available, 13 of 65 siblings (20%) were known to have or were suspected to have Wilson's disease. This corresponds to the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.",,"Dobyns, W. B.;Goldstein, N. P.;Gordon, H.",1979,Jan,,0,0,

Although a rare syndrome, Wilson disease should be considered after ruling out hepatitis B or autoimmune liver disease as a cause of juvenile cirrhosis.

875,The formation and nature of the mixed-valence copper-D-penicillamine chloride cluster in aqueous solution and its importance in the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Complex formation between D-penicillamine (Pen) and copper(II) ions was investigated under simulated physiological conditions both in the presence and in the absence of the blood plasma components albumin, alanine, histidine and zinc(II). Chromatographic and UV/Vis and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (ESR) spectroscopic methods were used. The main species formed at neutral pH and 0.15 mol dm-3 NaCl is the purple species, which has been shown to have the same stoichiometry as the recently reported solid-state complex, that is, [Cu8I Cu6II (Pen)12 Cl]5 - . It is shown that the formation rate of this species (MVC) depends on the Cu concentration, Cu:Pen ratio, relative Cl ion concentration, pH and temperature. Formation is inhibited by the presence of O2 and biological chelates. At the concentrations found in blood plasma, it is unlikely that the MVC ion has any relevance to the therapeutic effect of penicillamine in the treatment of Wilson's disease. A re-examination of the aqueous Cu-albumin pin system confirms previous findings that the pin is unable to mobilize Cu bound to albumin. Significant binding of the pin to the protein is observed, unrelated to any protein-bound copper ions. Evidence that ternary complexes of the amino acid-Cu-Pen type can form in blood plasma is presented. However, these are unlikely to be physiologically significant and the copper depletion induced by Pen in cases of Wilson's disease must occur elsewhere than in the blood plasma compartment.",,"Laurie, S.

878,Hepatic copper accumulation in primary biliary cirrhosis,"Hepatic copper accumulation is a regular feature of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). The values are directly related to the clinical stage of the disease. Since copper levels in PBC are comparable to Wilson's disease, there is a possibility of copper toxicity, although this is speculative since the two diseases differ in the binding, distribution, and intracellular localization of copper. The involvement of copper toxicity in the progression of PBC is supported by the observation that the highest levels are associated with liver failure, which occurs at an advanced stage. Corticosteroid therapy appears to decrease hepatic copper levels in PBC. Although this therapy does not always lower hepatic Cu levels in patients with PBC, it does in many individuals. Therapy trials with D-penicillamine are in progress. When results are available, they will guide us in treating individual patients with PBC. In the meantime, dietary copper intake should be restricted, as is done in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Benson, G. D.",1979,Jan-Feb,,0,0,

After ingestion of 900 mg DL-penicillamine, mean cupriuresis values were in the range of 500 gamma to 600 gamma/24 h.

Serum ceruloplasmin levels were decreased in five patients (25%) with chronic active hepatitis and were normal in seven patients (28%) with Wilson's disease at the time of diagnosis. 24-hour urinary copper excretion did not provide an accurate distinction between the two groups, as it was elevated in all patients with Wilson's disease and in five of eight patients with chronic active hepatitis studied. All patients with Wilson's disease had hepatic copper levels greater than 400 micrograms/g dry weight, while patients with chronic active hepatitis had levels less than 300 micrograms/g dry weight. The discriminatory value of hepatic copper concentration makes this test the most reliable test for distinguishing between chronic active hepatitis and Wilson's disease in children and adolescents.

Until now, because the presence of trace minerals is so ubiquitous in nature, many clinicians have believed that deficiencies are only likely to develop under very extreme conditions. The increased use of total parenteral nutrition seems to have made this view untenable. The recognition of additional genetic disorders of trace element metabolism such as Menkes' kinky hair syndrome and acrodermatitis enteropathica has also helped draw clinical attention to trace elements. In the course of time further diseases of the trace element metabolism will certainly be recognized. [References: 57]",,"Burch, R. E.;Hahn, H. K.",1979,Sep,,0,0,

Urine was collected for three periods after injection, 0 to 8 hours, 8 to 24 hours at which time a test dose of penicillamine was administered, and 24 to 30 hours. Stable (endogenous) copper was also estimated on these samples and the specific activity determined. This was multiplied by a correction factor to account for variations in dose and body weight. Results for stable urinary copper were largely predictable. Controls and heterozygotes had the lowest copper excretion, with amounts increasing in the pre-symptomatic patients to a peak in the symptomatic patients. Initiation of therapy was associated with a proportional decrease in copper excretion over time. The main radiochemical findings were as follows. Heterozygotes excreted less of the injected copper than controls under both basal conditions and after penicillamine. Presymptomatic patients excreted less radiocopper than heterozygotes after penicillamine, although excretion was much greater during the basal 24-hour period. Patients with symptomatic Wilson's disease had by far the highest excretion of radiocopper in all three time periods, which decreased proportionally with time after treatment, as found for stable copper. These results were subjected to computer analysis. There was no overlap between the different groups except for a single control subject who had combined degeneration of the pyramidal and extrapyramidal systems of unclear etiology. This patient was classified as ""heterozygous"" by the computer study. These results support the hypothesis that loss of a single copper budget gene can be detected with high fidelity and that even presymptomatic patients from a sibling can be selected for prophylactic treatment without risk of exposing healthy heterozygotes to unnecessary treatment and potentially dangerous long-term therapy.",,"Gibbs, K.;Hanka, R.;Walshe, J.

Patients may initially be seen with acute or chronic hepatitis, hemolytic anemia, or neurological dysfunction. Guidelines for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease are presented based on a study of 25 pediatric and adolescent patients.

Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia have sometimes been attributed to D-penicillamine treatment and its toxicity; However, we have found that cytopenia is a common finding in the available laboratory data from patients with Wilson's disease. Twenty-eight patients (52%) had thrombocytopenia and 16 of these patients (30% of the total) also had leucopenia. Severe, acute, intermittent hemolytic episodes were one patient's initial and only complaint. Six of the patients with significant cytopenias had splenectomy, and in all cases peripheral blood counts returned to normal. Long-term treatment with D-penicillamine improved hepatic and neurological dysfunction in most patients; however, cytopenias remained unchanged except in three patients (2, 5, and 10 years treated).",,"Hogland, H.

893,Failure of L-dopa to alleviate activated rigidity in Parkinson's disease,"Rigidity in Parkinson's patients can be easily quantified by determining the network required to passively flex and extend the forearm through an arc of 100 degrees. The rigidity thus measured can be divided into two very distinct types, quiescent and activated. Resting rigidity, measured in a relaxed patient, is responsive to all effective therapeutics and correlates closely with the degree of clinical improvement. Activated rigidity, measured during voluntary activity, is not relieved by any currently available medical treatment. It remains unchanged at pre-therapy levels, even in patients who temporarily appear to show dramatic improvement in clinical symptoms. Longitudinal measurements performed in hundreds of PD patients over 5 to 15 year intervals show sustained high levels of activated rigidity throughout the study period. In marked contrast to our broad experience with Parkinson's patients is a single, well-documented case of Wilson's disease that appears to have fully recovered by both clinical examination and all our machine measurements. This patient had a high level of extrapyramidal deficit, measured repeatedly over a four month period when penicillamine therapy was evaluated. Then he suddenly returned to normal and returned to a full-time job. High scores of resting rigidity activated rigidity, akinesia, and resting tremor all returned to normal and have remained normal over the past 6 years. The implication of this study is that L-Dopa and related treatments only mask the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and do not delay the underlying pathological process. Penicillamine, on the other hand, probably alleviates the destructive process in Wilson's disease and can permanently relieve extrapyramidal dysfunction in early cases.",,"Webster, D. D.;Mortimer, J.

Two main types of chronic or primary hypomagnesemia are known, caused either by impaired intestinal absorption or by improper renal processing of magnesium. In acrodermatitis enteropathica, an autosomal recessive disease that leads to characteristic skin lesions, alopecia and dystrophy, low zinc concentrations are measured in serum, urine and hair. The intestinal absorption of zinc is reduced. Two hereditary diseases with low serum and mostly caerulosplasmin concentrations are known in the copper metabolism.

This was accompanied by acute renal failure. In the absence of adequate renal function for urinary excretion of penicillamine, studies were conducted to evaluate the potential of peritoneal dialysis, ascites removal by ultrafiltration reinfusion, and hemodialysis as alternative routes of copper excretion. The greatest amount of copper appeared to be eliminated during hemodialysis as measured by increasing bath concentrations. However, this was accompanied by a progressive increase in serum copper concentrations with rapid clinical and biochemical deterioration, leading to death within 48 hours. A small amount of copper was lost during the removal of the ascites. Substantial amounts of copper were removed during peritoneal dialysis (36 µmol/day (2287 micrograms/day)), although no clinical response was evident prior to the introduction of hemodialysis. Oral, intravenous or intraperitoneal administration of penicillamine did not lead to a measurable increase in the excretion of copper in the peritoneal dialysate. Therefore, peritoneal dialysis alone appears to offer the greatest potential benefit both in terms of copper elimination and in altering the course of this fulminant form of Wilson's disease.",,"Hamlyn, A.

Of the 35 symptomatic patients originally seen and treated at the Mayo Clinic, 34 (97%) had Kayser-Fleischer rings and 6 (17%) had sunflower cataracts at the time of diagnosis. In patients followed for one year or more, penicillamine therapy resulted in improvement of Kayser-Fleischer rings in 18 of 20 (90%) patients and complete resolution of sunflower cataracts in 4 of 5 patients. The specific pattern of copper deposition in Kayser-Fleischer rings and the improvement from treatment occurred along four reproducible stages. None of the five asymptomatic siblings of patients with known Wilson's disease had Kayer-Fleischer rings at the time of the first study. One (untreated) of the five developed Kayser-Fleischer rings 20 months after initial normal slit lamp examination. The presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and the absence of other ophthalmologic signs (such as nystagmus, cranial nerve palsies, and other movement disorders) can be of great help in diagnosing Wilson's disease. Once the disease has been diagnosed, targeted drug therapy with penicillamine and a low-copper diet dramatically improves the otherwise inevitably fatal course.",,"Wiebers, D. O.;Hollenhorst, R.

In addition, she had extensive esophageal varices and the pregnancy was complicated by toxemia. The other nine patients remained healthy and two had three pregnancies each. On six occasions, penicillamine was taken throughout the pregnancy, but on seven it was stopped from weeks six to 12. All 15 babies were normal, but one died of extreme prematurity (26 weeks gestation).

906,The peroxisomes of human hepatocytes,"In an ultrastructural study of human liver biopsy specimens, we found that peroxisomes are regularly present in normal human hepatocytes. Their relationships to the endoplasmic reticulum, observed in other species and other organs, were also detectable in this material. Some normal peroxisomes were found to have marginal plates or peripheral crystalline inclusions, which were also present in pathological specimens. In certain congenital metabolic disorders (Menkes-Staehlerne-Haar disease, analbuminaemia), the volume of the individual peroxisomes appeared to be significantly reduced. But most pathological processes affecting hepatocytes appear to have one or more of the following causes: increase in volume or number per cell, changes in shape, changes in consistency of the matrix, appearance of dense numbers per cell, changes in shape, changes the consistency of the matrix, occurrence of dense inclusions or accumulation of peroxisomes in some parts of the cytoplasm. Some of these abnormalities are reversible, based on observations in three patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine. The mean +/- standard deviation of peroxisome diameters in four healthy subjects was 0.618 +/- 0.143 mm. Significant reductions or increases in mean peroxisome diameters were noted in all but two of the 16 pathological specimens. Other morphological anomalies were present in the remaining two samples. We conclude that different pathological processes affecting the hepatocytic cytoplasm exert different effects on peroxisomes. Although no specific pattern of morphological changes emerged from this exploratory study, a possible involvement of peroxisomes should be considered whenever metabolic or pathological processes involve the liver.",,"Sternlieb, I.;Quintana, N.",1977,Feb,,0,0,

915,Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration),"Wilson's disease, or hepatolenticular degeneration, is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism that usually affects young people. Excess copper accumulates in the tissues, especially in the liver, brain and cornea. This copper deposition leads to a variety of hepatic and neurological symptoms and can cause psychiatric disorders. Liver involvement often occurs in childhood, while neurological deficits are generally discovered at a later age. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Ocular findings are of particular importance since the corneal copper deposit forming the Kayser-Fleischer ring is the only pathognomonic sign of the disease. The structure of the ring and the presence of copper are well known. An anterior capsular deposit of copper in the lens results in a characteristic sunflower cataract in some of these patients. Other ocular abnormalities have been described but are much less common. The pathogenesis of the disease and the underlying genetic defect remain obscure. It is clear that there is excess copper in tissues, but the mechanism of its deposition is unknown. It is associated in some way with a failure to synthesize the serum copper protein ceruloplasmin normally. Another theory suggests that an abnormal protein with a high affinity for copper can bind the metal in tissues. The diagnosis can be suggested by the clinical manifestations and confirmed by the presence of a Kayser-Fleischer ring. If these findings are missing, biochemical determinations are necessary. The most important of these are serum ceruloplasmin, urinary copper, and hepatic copper concentration at biopsy. Treatment consists of giving the copper chelating agent penicillamine and avoiding high copper intake. This usually leads to a marked clinical improvement if irreversible tissue damage has not occurred. Lifelong maintenance therapy is necessary to maintain the negative copper balance.

The characteristic mitochondrial abnormalities found in the hepatocytes of untreated patients were less pronounced or disappeared after treatment in 5 of the 7 patients.

925,The effect of long-term treatment with penicillamine on hepatic copper content in patients with Wilson's disease,"Determination of the hepatic copper concentration is the most accurate criterion in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. During the course of penicillamine therapy, the level of copper in the liver decreases, but normal values are only reached after five or more years of treatment. The normalization of the hepatic copper concentration clearly lags behind the clinical condition. A significant improvement in the clinical condition is already achieved after six months to a year of treatment. The correlation between hepatic copper concentration and the amount of copper excreted in the urine is statistically significant both before the start of treatment and during the administration of penicillamine. Urinary copper excretion is a good indirect indicator of hepatic copper concentration.",,"Marecek, Z.;Heyrovsky, A.;Volek, V.",1975,Oct,,0,0,
926,Juvenile Wilson's disease: histological and functional studies during penicillamine therapy,"Because the long-term effects of penicillamine on liver morphology in Wilson's disease are virtually unknown, seven patients with this disorder were studied two to seven years after initiating drug treatment. All were asymptomatic at follow-up. Compared to initial biopsies (four patients), post-treatment specimens showed either a significant reduction in portal fibrosis (two patients) or no significant change (two patients); Portal vein inflammation and necrosis were greatly reduced or absent in three. In none has there been a complete restoration of normal architecture. Three patients lacked initial biopsies. Portal cirrhosis, inflammation and necrosis as well as fatty vacuolation of the hepatocytes were present three, five and seven years after the start of therapy. Lipofuscin pigment was abundant in follow-up biopsies. The data show that morphologic improvement is achieved in some patients with Wilson's disease receiving penicilliamine, but that this is not predicted by biochemical factors. Sequential biopsies are necessary to fully assess the extent of healing.",,"Grand, R. J.;Vawter, G. F.",1975,Dec,,0,0,

Cell Biol. 59:246a, 1973; Exp. Mol. Pathol. 21: 398, 1974) have been found in the hepatocytes of patients with Wilson's disease. These organelles account for 1 to 2 percent of observed lipid droplets in the disease state when excess fat is present.

It is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations or deletions in ZEB2. While no skin manifestation of MOWS was documented, we found for the first time that MOWS patients exhibited skin hyperextensibility and fragility resembling Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the skin of a MOWS patient showed dermal collagen fibrils with significantly reduced diameters. To investigate the role of ZEB2 in collagenogenesis, conditional ZEB2 knockout (cKO) mice were generated by crossing ZEB2<sup>flox</sup>/<sup>flox</sup> mice with Cre mice under the Control of the prx 1 promoter generated. target the mesoderm. Newborn ZEB2-cKO mice were small and showed abnormalities in teeth and scalp bones. Notably, the skin of ZEB2-cKO mice appeared lax and hyperextensible, and histological examination revealed hypoplasia of the dermis. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that dermal fibroblasts (DFs) from ZEB2-cKO mice expressed decreased collagen 1 and 3 genes but increased MMP13 genes. Electron micrographs of the dermis of ZEB2-cKO mice revealed collagen fibrils with unusually small diameters, resembling those found in a MOWS patient. Finally, ZEB2-cKO mice showed impaired fibrogenesis by subcutaneous injection of bleomycin. These results suggest that ZEB2 contributes to de novo and induced collagenogenesis and, more importantly, that MOWS is relevant to a novel subtype of EDS.",,"Teraishi, M.;Takaishi, M.;Nakajima, K.;Mizuno, S.;Hiraki, Y.;Fukada, T.;Shimoda, S.;Asada, Y.;Wakamatsu, N.;Furukawa, T.;Sano, S.",2016,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jdermsci.2016.08.416,0,0,
1108,Psychosis in Wilson's disease: An unusual presentation of bipolar affective disorder,"Psychosis is a rare but recognized symptom of the neurological effects of Wilson's disease [1]. We report the presentation of a 55-year-old woman, C., who was admitted after showing a decline in mental status. During the first examination in the emergency room, security personnel and the police handcuffed her and behaved aggressively. She spoke softly, voiced paranoid paranoia, was euthymic with labile affect, alternated between anger and tearfulness, and showed uninhibited affection by acting frontally. She completely lacked insight. She was detained for an investigation period under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act (MHA) 2007. C. had previously been instructed several times in accordance with the MHA. Previous major diagnoses were Wilson's disease and bipolar affective disorder (BPAD). As a result of her Wilson's disease, she had developed liver cirrhosis, abdominal varices, portal and pulmonary hypertension (WHO functional class II) with massive splenomegaly. She has a history of behavioral outbursts; Acquiring a forensic history of assaults against employees, police officers, and family members, as well as drunk and disorderly conduct. In the weeks leading up to admission, she had stopped all of her medications, including her penicillamine. A. Neurological examination showed ataxia with a broad-based gait and mild bradykinesia. C had no wing flapping tremor, dystonia, or myoclonus. All other findings of the neurological examination were normal. She had a copper level of 1.7 imol/L, ceruloplasmin of 0.04 g/L and bilirubin of 50 imol/L. Complete blood count showed pancytopenia and extended blood count showed low calcium with vitamin D deficiency. A CT of her head showed hypodensity in the putamen that was worse on the left. There was no mass, infarction, or infectious process that could explain the lesions. This was consistent with an MRI of the brain performed a few months prior to enrollment, which showed hyperintensity of both putamina. Such changes are known to be associated with Wilson's disease [2]. These findings, along with C's behavior suggestive of frontal lobe involvement, suggested to the lead team the diagnosis of psychosis secondary to neurological Wilson's disease. She was effectively treated with paliperidone depot (100 mg monthly), risperidone ON 4 mg and penicillamine (750 mg BD) along with her usual medication for liver cirrhosis. To date, it is stable and has not been resumed. The MRI and CT brain findings, along with C's longstanding Wilson's disease, challenged her diagnosis of BPAD. After reviewing the case notes, her previous presentations contained behavioral and neurological findings consistent with neurological sequelae of Wilson's disease. Psychiatric symptoms in Wilson's disease are common, with one study finding that 20% of WM patients had seen a psychiatrist [3]. Personality changes and depression are typical, psychoses are a rare but recognized feature. Psychiatric symptoms are a recognized side effect of penicillamine and cloud diagnostic clarity [1]. Literature reviews suggest that Wilson disease may present with only psychiatric symptoms for many years before neurological or hepatic symptoms develop. Wilson's disease should therefore not be disregarded in unusual manifestations of psychosis, as in the case of C.",,"Black, L. F.;Underwood, J. F. G.",2017,October,,0,0,
1109,Optical coherence tomography as a marker of neurodegeneration in patients with Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to pathologic accumulation of copper in various organs. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is proposed as a marker of neurodegeneration in many neurological disorders. Thinning of total retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular thickness (Mth), assessed by OCT, has been noted in patients with WM, particularly in those with brain magnetic resonance imaging changes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between OCT parameters and neurological symptom progression, as measured by the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), in patients with WD. Consecutive patients with WD admitted to the Department of Neurology underwent OCT to assess macular thickness and total RNFL thickness. Patients also underwent neurological evaluations according to UWDRS Part III. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence (UWDRS+) and absence (UWDRS-) of neurological symptoms. Fifty-eight patients (34 females, 24 males) were included. The mean duration of treatment was 9 years (standard deviation [SD], +/-10.8). The mean UWDRS score at the time of the study was 8.4 (range 1-52; SD +/-13.9) points. Both total RNFL and macular thickness were significantly reduced in the UWDRS+ group compared to the UWDRS group. A significant negative correlation was found between OCT parameters (RNFL and Mth measurements) and neurological impairment according to the UWDRS scale. This study confirms that OCT can be a useful tool to measure the degree of neurodegeneration in patients with WM and play a role in monitoring disease progression.

1110,Diagnosis and treatment of fulminant Wilson's disease: the experience of a single center,"Background: Drug therapy is rarely effective in patients with fulminant Wilson's disease (FWD). Liver transplantation is limited by the lack of a donor liver in most patients with FWD at the time of diagnosis. The new Wilson Index, the End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) model and the Child-Pugh score are useful tools in liver transplant decision-making; however, none of them is an independent crucial tool. It is worth exploring a more effective and practical therapy strategy and reassessing the predictive systems for patients with FWD. METHODS: Nine patients with FWD associated with hemolytic crisis and fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) were studied. The clinical appearance, the prognostic score and the drug therapies of the patients were analyzed. Results: Of 7 of the 9 patients with FWD who received extensive therapy with corticosteroids, copper chelators (dimercaptopropane sulfonate sodium), and therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), 6 patients recovered from FHF. The remaining one had improved with extensive therapy but died 51 days later of septicemia. Two patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) died of liver failure within three or five days of hospitalization without plasma exchange or chelation therapy. All 9 patients with FWD presented with acute liver failure, severe jaundice, and mild to severe hemolytic anemia. No clear difference was found in the incidence of severe hemolytic anemia between the surviving and deceased groups. However, the incidence and grade of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) was higher in the non-survival group than in the survivor group. Unlike the deceased group, the surviving group had no complications induced by bacterial infection. When compared to the new Wilson index, Child-Pugh score and MELD score, the variation in prothrombin activity (PTA) between the surviving and deceased groups was more evident. Conclusion: In patients with FWD, an episode of severe hepatic encephalopathy or/and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis indicates a poorer prognosis, and PTA is a recommended predictor. Emergency liver transplantation should be considered in patients whose PTA is less than 20% or in patients with severe HE and/or SBP. Comprehensive therapy of corticosteroids, copper chelators, and TPE is effective in patients without SBP and whose PTA is greater than 20%.

1111,Dystonic dysarthria in Wilson's disease: efficacy of zolpidem,"Wilson disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by copper overload in the liver and brain. Neurological presentations are primarily related to the accumulation of copper in the basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum. Dysarthria is a common symptom with dystonic, spastic, or parkinsonian components and is usually resistant to medical or voice rehabilitation therapies. Here we report the case of a patient with WD who was diagnosed at age 12 and presented with severe and persistent dysarthria of dystonic origin unresponsive to benzodiazepines and anticholinergics. When she was 25 years old, she tried zolpidem at bedtime for trouble sleeping and reported a paradoxical effect of this drug on her voice. To confirm the effect of zolpidem on her dystonic dysarthria, we performed a full assessment of her dysarthria at baseline without zolpidem and after 4 days of treatment with 10 mg twice daily. Lexical access was assessed based on semantic fluency; Dysarthria by the Intelligibility Score, the spontaneous speaking and reading speed, the maximum phonation time on the sustained vowel [a] and by a perceptual assessment. Two hours after zolpidem ingestion, an improvement in all parameters tested except maximum phonation time was observed. Semantic fluency increased by 59%, spontaneous response rate by 88%, and reading performance by 76%. The general dystonia remained unchanged and the tolerability of zolpidem was satisfactory. Since then the patient has been taking zolpidem 5 mg five times a day and 4 years later shows sustained improvement in oral communication and good drug tolerability. In this single-case study, we showed that regular daily dosing of zolpidem could have a sustained effect on complex dystonic dysarthria that was resistant to current medical treatments.

1112,Oromandibular dystonia in Wilson's disease,"Background: Movement disorders are common in Wilson's disease (WD), but oromandibular dystonia (OMD) has not been reported. We report the frequency, severity, and MRI correlation of OMD in Wilson's disease with neurological manifestations (WDNM) and their response to treatment. METHODS: Consecutive WDNM patients were enrolled and their clinical, hematological, serum chemistry, and MRI findings were noted. The neurological severity of WD and OMD was assessed. Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) score for dystonia was recorded. Patients were treated with penicillamine, zinc, and several antidystonic drugs. Clinical improvement was noted after 3 and 6 months. Results: A total of 61 of 67 (91%) WDNM patients had OMD, whose mean age was 13.5 years. The median severity of OMD was 2.5 (range 1-4). 13 patients were anarthric and 12 unable to eat. OMD severity correlated with drooling (r=0.29; P=0.02), BFM score (r=0.63; P<0.001), pancytopenia (r=-0.26; P=0.04). ) and serum ceruloplasmin (r = 0.33; P = 0.01), but not with location and number of MRI lesions. Compared to baseline, OMD severity improved at 6 months (p<0.001) but not at 3 months. None became asymptomatic. Improvement in OMD paralleled improvement in WDNM severity (r = 0.26; P = 0.04) and BFM score (r = 0.31; P = 0.02). Conclusion: OMD was a common manifestation of WDNM, occurring in 91% of patients, and OMD partially improved over the study period.

1114,Morbus Wilson: what has been confirmed in diagnostics and therapy? [German],"Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal copper accumulation. The diverse clinical manifestations of WM, which presents a wide variety of phenotypes and is thus a chameleon within the group of metabolic diseases, can include hepatological, neurological and psychiatric manifestations. Early onset in infancy and late onset in adults over 70 years of age have been described. In the absence of typical laboratory blood counts, WM diagnosis can be difficult and often involves a combination of different parameters. Novel test methods such as the identification of the relatively exchangeable copper have not been validated in a sufficient cohort of WM patients and therefore do not currently play a crucial role in the clinical setting. Consequently, any patient with reasonable suspicion of WM needs to be presented to a (pediatric) gastroenterologist and/or (pediatric) neurologist. Various medical treatments, including drugs such as copper chelators, are commonly used in clinical settings. Liver transplantation may be the last resort in selected patients. Dietary changes with a low-copper diet play only a minor role. With the use of tetrathiomolybdate still not approved, treating advanced and progressive neurological symptoms remains a major challenge. In any case, lifelong medical supervision and treatment by a specialist is mandatory. Early diagnosis and early and lifelong treatment lead to better prognosis and do not negatively affect overall life expectancy. Copyright © 2017 Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH",,"Pfister, E.

1115,"Evolving perspectives in Wilson's disease: diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance","Wilson's disease (WD), the autosomal recessive inherited copper overload disorder, remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. In the last decade, direct sequencing of the affected gene ATP7B has become commercially available, but interpreting the results still requires careful attention. Therefore, a combination of tests that reflect the impaired copper metabolism is required for the final diagnosis. Due to the low incidence of the disease, the existing treatment concepts are not based on controlled trails. Current reports of the results of larger cohort studies question the recommended therapies and call for individualized treatment strategies. The notion that certain medical therapies are either insufficient to maintain copper homeostasis or can lead to clinically relevant overtreatment requires continuous monitoring of patients even after decades of therapy.

1117,Significant heterogeneity in the diagnosis and treatment of Wilson's disease (WD): results from a large Spanish registry,"There are areas of uncertainty regarding diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies in patients diagnosed with WM, one of the few rare diseases in hepatology. Our aim was to assess whether the approach to WD diagnosis and treatment is homogeneous between centers in a large multicenter Spanish registry. METHODS: GEMHEP (Spanish Group of Female Hepatologists) descriptive observational study collecting clinical and laboratory data from 126 WM patients in 28 Spanish hospitals. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 20 (range: 1-74) years, 60% were males. The median follow-up (FU) was 16 years (1-44). The most common mode of presentation was hepatic (70%; mean age: 18 years), followed by mixed (12%; mean age: 33 years) and neurological (8%; mean age: 23 years). The remaining 10% were diagnosed by family screening. Kayser-Fleisher ring and cirrhosis were present in one-third of the cases at diagnosis. In diagnostic non-invasive laboratory parameters, contradictory results were observed in 58% of the cases; While ceruplasmin (CP) levels were decreased in 88% of cases, only 43% of patients had 24-hour cupuria above 100 mcg/24 hours at the time of diagnosis. Intrahepatic copper concentration was performed in most patients, the results of which were compatible with WD in 79%. Genetic testing was performed on half of the patients with WD-compatible mutations, which were found in the majority (83%). DP and zinc (Zn) were the most common initial therapies, used as monotherapy in 76% and 18% of patients, respectively. Treatment was modified during follow-up in half of the patients at a median of 8 years, mainly due to conversion to Zn maintenance therapy (47% at a median of 7 years) or toxicity (39% at a median of 2 years). ). Despite good adherence in 90% of patients, up to a third of patients had abnormal liver enzymes at the last FU visit. Obesity and hypertension were more common in these patients (p=0.006 and 0.05, respectively). Additional data will be collected to conduct a more thorough analysis of the factors associated with liver enzyme failure. CONCLUSIONS: In our multicenter Spanish cohort, conflicting results related to standard tests for the diagnosis of WM were common. This variability may be due to a lack of inter-laboratory reproducibility, resulting in the need to perform invasive techniques in a significant number of patients. Although the majority of patients begin treatment with DP, switching to Zn is the norm due to either maintenance protocol and/or toxicity. In a third of the cases, complete normalization of liver enzymes was not achieved, possibly due to other causes.",,"Berenguer, M.",2017,October,,0,1,
1118,Clinical presentation and outcome of patients with Wilson's disease in a monocentric cohort of liver reference centers,"Introduction. Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that results in liver cirrhosis and neurobehavioral deterioration. Clinical data on larger cohorts are limited due to the low morbidity. Goal. Determine the clinical presentation and outcomes of patients with Wilson's disease in a cohort of patients from a French liver reference center. methods. We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with a confirmed WM diagnosis evaluated at a liver reference center at Paul Brousse Hospital, Villejuif, France. The patients were examined clinically, biologically, morphologically and genetically. Liver involvement was assessed by liver biopsy and/or measurement of liver stiffness. Results. We included in this cohort 107 patients with hepatic symptoms of WD, 54 (50.5%) females and 53 (49.5%) males, from 1974 to 2016. The mean follow-up time was 15 years with extremes of 1 to 44 years . Fifty-seven of 107 patients (53.3%) had neurological symptoms (mixed symptoms, neurological and hepatic) on admission. The mean age at diagnosis of WM was 20.1 (> 10.54) years with an age difference between the ""liver group"" for hepatic symptoms (17 <= 8.6 years) and the other group with neurological symptoms (23 > 11, 4 years) (p=0.0081). Pathologic analysis of the liver was performed in 65 patients (70%) and measurement of liver stiffness in 72 (67%). 73 patients (68%) had cirrhosis at the time of disease diagnosis. Forty-three patients (76%) had cirrhosis in patients with mixed symptoms (neurological and hepatic) and 30 (61%) in patients with isolated hepatic symptoms. Thirty-four of 107 patients (32%) were transplanted, mean age 27 (> 12.2) years. Of the patients requiring liver transplantation, 18 (52%) had decompensated cirrhosis, 8 (23%) had fulminant liver failure, 8 (23.5%) had severe neurological disease, and 5 (14%) had liver cancer. The chelating treatment consisted predominantly of D-penicillamine in 104/107 patients. Thirty-seven (35%) patients required a change in treatment due to adverse reactions to trientine or zinc salts. Four patients died in this cohort; two after primary liver cancer (1 HCC and 1 cholangiocarcinoma), one after hemorrhagic stroke and one after liver transplantation because of severe neurological symptoms. Conclusion. At presentation of Wilson's disease, two-thirds of patients referred to a hepatology referral center had cirrhosis and one-third required liver transplantation. Cirrhosis is diagnosed in 76% of patients who have neurological symptoms of the disease. Although Wilson's disease can be a serious disease, the prognosis for patients treated in a specialized center is good.",,"Sobesky, R.;Bello, M.

1119,Excretion of WTX101 (bischolintetrathiomolybdate) after intravenous administration in rat models,"Background Wilson disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by accumulation of toxic free copper (Cu). WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational Cu protein binding agent for WD. WTX101 rapidly binds Cu and forms a stable three-part complex of tetrathiomolybdate, Cu and albumin. Our aim was to characterize the pathways and clearance rates of intravenous (IV) WTX101 over 168 hours after administration. Methods Long Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats (a model of WD) and Long Evans Agouti (LEA) rats (control strain with normal Cu metabolism) received a single IV dose of WTX101 at either 0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg administered. WTX101 was measured as molybdenum (Mo) in urine, faeces and selected tissues collected over 168 hours. Results In the LEC-WD rat model, WTX101 was partially cleared at 168 hours. Up to 45% of the dosed Mo was recovered in the excretions: renal clearance accounted for up to 29% of the dose and biliary clearance for about 16%. Mo appeared to be excreted in two phases: a rapid elimination during the first 48 h mainly in the urine, and a slower faecal elimination that continued up to 168 h. In contrast, control LEA rats showed almost complete clearance of WTX101 within 168 h (87%), mainly by renal clearance during the first 24 h (79%). Considering only the excreted Mo, the ratio between renal and fecal excretion was 9:1 in LEA rats but 6:4 in LEC rats. In both LEC and LEA rats, urinary Mo corresponded to molybdate, the terminal degradation product of WTX101. Mo excretion and tissue distribution was similar for the two WTX101 dose levels. Differences in Mo tissue distribution were only found in LEC vs. LEA rats for organs with high Cu content due to WD phenotype: significantly more tissue Mo was found in LEC liver at 168 h (with 1.5 mg /kg: 31.5 vs. 5.6% of the dose) and kidney (7.6 vs. 1.5% of the dose) compared to LEA rats. Conclusion In the WD model, biliary excretion of Mo from WTX101 was increased compared to controls, likely reflecting differential biotransformation under normal and Cu overload conditions and consistent with the proposed MoA of WTX101. In LEA controls, small amounts of Cu are available for binding to tetrathiomolybdate, allowing a greater proportion of tetrathiomolybdate to be converted to the terminal degradation product molybdate, which does not bind Cu and is excreted in the urine. In the LEC-WD model, excess Cu is bound in a tripartite tetrathiomolybdate-Cu-albumin complex that prevents the conversion of tetrathiomolybdate to molybdate, resulting in a lower fraction of urinary excretion and a higher fraction of fecal excretion. The different tissue distribution observed between the models is also consistent with the MoA of WTX101.",,"Plitz, T.;Boyling, L.",2017,October,,0,0,
1120,Decompensated Wilson's disease: advanced hepatic encephalopathy and high bilirubin determine the need for liver transplantation. Does the New Wilson's index help?,"Background: The decision to have a liver transplant is rather difficult in decompensated Wilson's disease (WD). The New Wilson's Index (NWI), once considered helpful, now has conflicting reports of its effectiveness in predicting WD's outcome. METHODS: Of the 85 cases of WD, 74 were either acute chronic liver failure (ACLF) or decompensated CLD (DCLD). They were treated with supportive care along with a combination of D-pencillamine and zinc salt. Univariate and multivariate analyzes were performed to see the association of risk factors with a poor outcome (liver transplantation or death) at any time during the hospital stay. Results: Of the total of 74 patients, medical management improved in 46 (62.2%) and 28 (37.8%) either died (21) or received transplants (7) within 3 months of diagnosis. Jaundice was the main symptom in 100% of ACLF cases and in 13 (33.3%) of DCLD cases. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) was present in 52 (70.3%) of 74 decompensated cases (ACLF or DCLD): 29 cases had HE grade 1/2 and 23 cases had HE grade 3/4. HE grade 3/4 was present in 19/35 (54.2%) of ACLF and 4/39 (10.2%) of DCLD, and the difference was significant (OR 10.39, 95% CI 3.03 -35.5, p=0.00). Among patients with poor outcome, significantly (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.15-8.16, p=0.0031) higher proportions of ACLF (18 of 35, 51.4%) than DCLD (10 of 39, 25.6%) present. Of those with New Wilson's Index (NWI) > 11 (33/74 cases), 12 survived and 21 had a poor outcome. Of the 28 with poor results, 20 had HE grade 3/4. When compared to a univariate analysis of clinical and biochemical parameters to identify the risk factors for a poor outcome, HE grade 3/4 (OR 35.8 95% CI 8.58-149, p=0.00), bilirubin > 20 mg/ dl (OR 14.3, 95% CI 3.58-57.2, p=0.000), ACLF as presentation (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.15-8.16, p=0.031), AST (mean difference 160.8, 95% CI 64.8-256, p=0.001), INR (mean difference 1.63, 95% CI 0.93-2.33, p=0.000), NWI (mean difference 5.37, 95% CI 3.67-7.08, p=0.00) and PELD/MELD score (mean difference 11.47, 95% CI 6.7-16.2, p=0, 00) were significantly associated with a poor outcome (Table 1). The LRA model (HE grade 3/4, bilirubin >20 mg/dl or HD score, NWI or INR or PELD) improved from 62.2% to 86.5% before and after the introduction of the model. In LRA, a significant association with a poor outcome was found only in HE grade 3/4 (adjusted OR 37.8, 95% CI 7.68-186.49 p=0.000) and bilirubin > 20 mg/dL (adjusted OR 15, 5, 95% CI 2.7-86.8) observed p=0.002). Conclusion: HE grade 3/4 and high bilirubin (>20 mg/dl) are independently associated with the need for liver transplantation in decompensated WM. NWI showed no significant independent association with the need for liver transplantation.",,"Alam, S.;Sood, V.;Khanna, R.;Lal, B. B.;Pawaria, A.",2017,October,,0,0,
1121,Epigenetic regulation of the thioredoxin system in an animal model and in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the copper transporter ATP7B, leading to accumulation of copper in the liver and brain. Excess copper has been shown to cause oxidative stress and impair DNA methylation. We hypothesized that dietary supplementation with the methyl donor choline, alone or in combination with the copper chelator penicillamine (PCA), will alter the hepatic expression of genes encoding the oxidative stress response pathway known as the thioredoxin system in toxic milk by Jackson (tx -j) mouse model by WD. In addition, we examined the whole blood DNA methylation profile in healthy and MV patients. Methods: Fetal Mouse Livers: Wild-type and tx-j dams ate normal or high-choline diet 2 weeks prior to gestation until embryonic day 17, at which time fetal livers were removed. Liver from adult tx-j offspring: Mice were randomized to one of 6 treatment groups: 1) normal choline in the mother and offspring; 2) high choline levels in the mother, normal choline levels in the offspring; 3) high choline levels in the mother and offspring; 4) maternal normal choline, offspring normal choline + PCA; 5) high maternal choline, normal offspring choline + PCA; 6) high choline in the mother, high choline in the offspring + PCA. Livers were collected at 24 weeks of age. Humans: DNA isolated from whole blood from 10 healthy (9M/1F) and 10 WD (9M/1F) patients was bisulfite-converted and used to prepare Methyl-Seq libraries for sequencing on an Illumina 2500 HiSeq . Samples were matched for age, sex, BMI, and race, and all WD samples contained the H1069Q mutation in the ATP7B gene. Results: Fetal hepatic transcript levels of the oxidative stress-related genes, thioredoxin 1 (Txn1) and peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1), were lower in fetal livers of tx-j mice compared to wild-type mice and thereafter normalized in tx -j-livers maternal choline supplementation. In 24-week-old offspring, hepatic transcript levels of Txn1 and Prdx1 were significantly higher (10-46% and 17-41%, respectively) in males and females receiving maternal and continuous choline compared to all other treatment groups. PCA-treated males and post-weaning deprived choline females had lower Txn1 levels (23-31%) compared to untreated tx-j mice. Hepatic Txn1 protein expression showed the same pattern as Txn1 gene expression. Of the 40 Txn-related genes examined in human blood, 5 genes showed hypermethylation (7-28%) and 2 genes showed hypomethylation (5-6%) in WM patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: Maternal and continued choline supplementation affects hepatic Txn1 transcript and protein levels in tx-j mice, and patients with WD have altered blood DNA methylation profiles of genes associated with the Txn system .",,"Kieffer, D.

1122,An ongoing extension of a phase 2 study of wtx101 in patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease,"Background: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a premier copper protein binding agent that reduces plasma non-ceruloplasmin bound copper (NCC) by forming tripartite complexes with albumin and increases biliary copper excretion. In a Phase 2 study, once-daily oral WTX101 rapidly reduced and controlled NCC, improved disability and neurological status, and stabilized liver function in newly diagnosed Wilson's disease (WD) patients at 24 weeks. Here we present preliminary 24- to 48-week data from the current extension period. METHODS: All 22 patients who completed the 24-week open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study elected to continue WTX101 treatment at once-daily response-controlled individualized dosing. The key parameters reviewed from 24 to 48 weeks were change in NCC levels corrected for copper in tripartite tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin complexes (NCC-corrected), liver status, neurological and disability scores using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) and safety. Results: Patients (aged 18 to 64 years, 45% male, 86% with neurological symptoms of varying degrees, and approximately 50% with cirrhosis at study entry) received WTX101 at a dose of 7.5 to 60 mg/day once daily, at get 30 mg/day for most patients. Between weeks 24 and 48, mean corrected NCC remained under control (0.9 muM at week 24 and 0.5 muM at week 48). Mean international normalized ratio, albumin and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score improved or remained unchanged at week 48 compared to week 24, indicating stability in liver function indicates. Reversible ALT elevations, observed in approximately 1/3 of patients prior to week 24, were not observed in the extension phase. Patients demonstrated continuous improvements in mean UWDRS disability score (2.2 vs. 4.1) and neurological score (12.5 vs. 16.6) at week 48 versus week 24. WTX101 was generally well tolerated. Neutropenia, observed in one patient at week 36, resolved with dose reduction. One patient discontinued the treatment because she wanted to have children. One patient with progressive disease developed neuropsychiatric deterioration despite ongoing treatment. Conclusions: WTX101 appears to be well tolerated in patients with WM beyond 24 weeks of treatment. Initial improvements in free copper, hepatic and neurological status were maintained or further improved with WTX101, suggesting that WTX101 may be an effective maintenance therapy for WD. These results, along with its simple dosing regimen, indicate that WTX101 has the potential to address several unmet needs in the treatment of WD.",,"Schilsky, M. L.;Askari, F.

1125,Unusual occurrence of de novo neurological disorders in Wilsonian siblings after orthotopic liver transplantation: A case report by three sisters,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal disorder of copper metabolism that leads to progressive liver cirrhosis, neurological impairment and renal dysfunction. Although WD is rare, it accounts for 6% to 20% of emergency liver transplants (LT) because of its rapid deterioration. This study aims to present two out of three sisters with WD who developed severe neurological complications after orthotopic liver transplantation. Case presentation: Three 28, 25 and 19 year old sisters who were known cases of WD cirrhosis and normal neurological status underwent LT from deceased donors. While the first and third sisters developed severe new-onset neurological disabilities 6 and 8 months after transplantation, respectively, the second sibling showed no symptoms. Pre-transplant brain magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintensity in the bilateral basal ganglia, particularly the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus on T2 and fluid-damped inversion-recovery sequences for both involved patients. Ceruloplasmin, copper, and 24-hour urinary copper excretion at diagnosis were 13 and 12.9 (mg/dl), 26 and 32 (lg/dl), and 9 and 21.8 (lg) for the first and third, respectively Sister. Neurological findings after transplantation were ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, sialorrhea and tremor. In addition, unilateral blepharoptosis was observed in the youngest sister. For copper toxicity, continuous administration of a chelating agent (mainly zinc sulfate) has been considered. Neurological symptoms improved significantly 6-8 months after transplantation. Conclusion: Although the published literature indicates that better pre-transplant conditions appear to be beneficial in achieving better outcomes in patients with WM, close monitoring of neurological symptoms during the long-term post-transplant course remains an important area. Since new neurological disabilities are not to be expected in WD after LT, this phenomenon needs to be further investigated in these siblings.",,"Aliakbarian, M.;Rezayat, K.

[Spanish],"Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) is a rare inherited disorder that usually affects the liver but can occur in different forms and have several systemic complications. The diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, especially in young patients, and consideration of the main risk groups. Appropriate and appropriate treatment is important to avoid complications. We present three cases of this disease that occurred in a family from Granada (Antioquia, Colombia) and were treated in a Level III facility in Cali (Colombia). The index case debuted with a neuropsychiatric disorder, the second was diagnosed based on family history, and the third started with steatohepatitis. The diagnostic score proposed by the Eighth Wilson's Disease Meeting was 3 in two patients and 4 in the third.

1128,Auxiliary partial orthotopic live liver transplantation in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder in which copper metabolism is disrupted, leading to accumulations of copper, particularly in the liver and brain. Wilson's disease can be treated with pharmacological agents such as B. chelating agents that induce urinary excretion of copper or zinc salts that inhibit copper absorption in the digestive tract. Liver transplantation is the only treatment option for Wilson disease when liver failure has occurred. In some patients i.e. those with Child-Pugh A score, neurological disease can be seen without liver failure. We recommend these patients an additional partial orthotopic liver transplantation. Here we present a 36-year-old male patient with a neurological disorder associated with Wilson's disease who had a successful living-donor orthotopic auxiliary liver transplantation using a left hepatic lobe. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease and had a liver biopsy based on neurological symptoms that included tremor, difficulty walking and speaking, and a low serum ceruloplasmin level of 7 mg/dL. Chronic necroinflammatory disease activity was 4/18 and the patient received chelation treatment. His liver function was normal. The donor was the patient's 57-year-old father, whose liver function tests were also normal. The graft to recipient weight ratio was 1% using a left lobe graft. After transplantation, serum ceruloplasmin levels at day 15 and month 1 were 14 and 19 mg/dL, respectively. At month 1, liver function tests were normal. Doppler sonography showed normal vascular flow in the native liver and the transplant. The patient's neurological symptoms were progressively reduced. Progressive neurological deterioration without hepatic insufficiency is considered a suitable indication for additional partial orthotopic liver transplantation; This procedure is recommended before the neurological and liver failure symptoms of Wilson's disease appear.

1130,Was cavum septum pellucidum the cause of an intractable seizure in a 17-year-old boy with Wilson's disease?,"Background Cavum septum pellucidum (CSP), which is frequently found incidentally in a few populations, occasionally becomes symptomatic when greatly enlarged. Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive congenital defect in copper metabolism characterized by abnormal accumulation of copper in various tissues, particularly the liver and brain. Seizure disorders, although rare in both CSP and WD, can occur in some patients with either condition. Case Report We report a case of a 17-year-old boy, a patient with known WM, who developed intractable seizures for a year that could not be controlled with large doses of antiepileptic drugs. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an enlargement of his pre-existing CSP, which was small and asymptomatic at the time of WM diagnosis. His WD was in a state of remission when he developed the seizure disorder. With endoscopic cyst windowing, he was relieved of the attack. Conclusions Symptomatic CSP is a rare disease, but the coexistence of WD is even rarer. Endoscopic cyst fenestration is a novel procedure that can be successful in properly selected cases. To the best of our knowledge, CSP associated with WD has not been reported in any English literature. Because of its rarity, we present this case together with a relevant literature review.

Here we report a 47-year-old male H1069Q homozygous Kayser-Fleischer ring-positive MV patient with low ceruloplasmin levels who was followed up and treated with chelating agents for nine years. The patient presented with neurological symptoms and cirrhosis of the liver at diagnosis. The clinical symptoms regressed after the start of treatment. Rapidly developed tumor metastases were found in the bones, lungs and liver (without jaundice). Autopsy revealed cholangiocarcinoma as the primary tumor, confirmed by strong CK7 positivity and Glypican 3 negativity.

Here we aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for young children under 10 years of age with asymptomatic WM in Japanese pediatric centers and to establish appropriate benchmarks for maintenance therapy. METHODS: We conducted a retro- and prospective study to examine 21 children (mean age 6 years, range 1-9) who met the diagnostic criteria for WM and who had pre-symptom onset at 10 participating pediatric centers in Japan exclusively with treated with zinc acetate. No additional WD sequelae such as jaundice, hepatomegaly, or neurological abnormalities were noted. We monitored serum AST and ALT, non-ceruloplasmin serum copper, and 24-hour urinary copper for 1–7 years after initiation of zinc monotherapy. We performed abdominal ultrasound and assessed clinical WM manifestations, drug compliance, and zinc side effects. The prescribed zinc acetate dose for patients <= 5 years was 25 mg twice daily; for these children aged 6 years and older, the dose was 25 mg three times a day. We increased the zinc dose if patients had AST/ALT > 50-70 U/L and decreased it if they had side effects of zinc such as iron deficiency anemia or pancytopenia. Results: At the time of diagnosis, AST/ALT and 24-hour urinary copper were 148+/-118/234+/-151 U/L and 124+/-54 cups/day (5.8+/-2, 9 cups/kg/day), respectively. All patients continued to take zinc with no evidence of zinc toxicity. None of our 21 patients became clinically symptomatic. AST/ALT decreased significantly to 54+/-30/77+/-49 U/L (P<0.001) 1 month after the start of treatment and was mostly maintained below 50 U/L for 1-7 years (AST/ALT: 33+/-7/38+/-17 and 29+/-5/34+/-6 U/l 1 or 7 years after the start of treatment). 24-hour urinary copper decreased significantly to 49 +/- 21 cups/day (2.2 +/- 1.1 cups/kg/day; P<0.001) 6 months after the start of treatment and was mostly below 75 cups /day maintained between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the remainder of the study (2.2 +/- 0.6 and 1.5 +/- 0.2 cups/kg/day 1 and 7 years after the start of the Treatment). Conclusions: Long-term zinc monotherapy for young children with asymptomatic WM has been shown to be highly effective and safe. A reasonable goal in treating young children with asymptomatic WD with zinc appears to be to keep both AST/ALT below 50 U/L and 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day (and below 75 cups/day).",,"Mizuochi, T.;Eda, K.;Takaki, Y.;Iwama, I.;Araki, M.;Inui, A.;Hara, S.;Kumagai, H.;Hagiwara, S.

1133,Liver transplantation in severe neurological forms of Wilson's disease; a multicentric French experience,"Introduction. The standard treatment for Wilson's disease (WD) consists of chelating agents of copper or zinc salts. Liver transplantation (LT) is indicated for immediate severe liver failure or severe worsening during treatment. The indication of LT in neurological forms without liver decompensation remains controversial. Goal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of LT in WM with severe neurological symptoms without decompensated liver function. methods. This is a retrospective study. From 2002 to 2015, seventeen patients in France underwent LT for severe neurological complications of WM with no improvement despite medical treatment, with no hepatic failure. All patients received chelating copper and 4 patients received chelating copper with zinc salts. Twelve patients worsened after diagnosis of WM and 5 patients after treatment interruption with no improvement after well-done treatment. Disease severity was assessed using the Unified WD Rating Scale (UWDRS) before and after LT. Results. The main neurological symptoms combined were dystonic postures (15/17), parkinsonian syndrome (9/17) and tremor (3/17). The mean age at diagnosis of WM was 17.9 [6-39] years and the interval time between deterioration and LT was 12.6 [3-24] months. The mean age at LT was 20.2 [11-41] years. All patients required an emergency procedure to gain access for transplantation. All patients had cirrhosis according to native liver analysis. The CHILD score at the time of transplantation was A for all patients. The mean follow-up time after transplantation was 51.8 [3-156] months. Survival was 84%, 75%, and 66% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. For patients who died of severe sepsis after LT, after an interval of 16 [1.5-36]. All of these 4 patients had severe sepsis with a stay in the intensive care unit before LT. Twelve (70%) required nutritional support (gastrostomy or jejunostomy) and 9 (53%) required tracheostomy related to dysphagia. All living patients showed improvement after LT. The mean percentage improvement of UWDRS was 61.2% (+/-22.2). According to percent improvement, 6 patients (35%) showed a strong improvement (>70%), 5 patients showed a moderate improvement (30% to 70%) and 2 (12%) showed a slight improvement (<30%). Conclusion. Liver transplantation is an effective treatment option for Wilson's disease for patients with worsening neurological symptoms despite medical management, even without liver failure. Patients with an unfavorable outcome died of severe sepsis. A long history of existing neurological symptoms and previous severe sepsis are derogatory factors.",,"Sobesky, R.;Poujois, A.;Brunet, A.

1134,Copper and molybdate metabolism in newly diagnosed Wilson's disease patients treated with WTX101,"Background and Objectives WTX101 (bischolintetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational compound with a novel copper binding mechanism. WTX101 has a favorable stability profile. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of WTX101 on parameters of copper and molybdenum metabolism in this phase 2 study. Methods 28 newly diagnosed adult patients with WD copper and molybdenum parameters in blood and urine were observed during treatment with WTX101. Results Urinary molybdenum excretion was robust, averaging 20% to 25% of the administered dose as early as 4 weeks after the start of treatment, with 24-hour molybdenum excretion ranging from 10 to 20 mmol. This showed good drug absorption. Percent urinary excretion of molybdenum was the same for WTX101 doses at 15 and 30 mg/d but lower at 60 mg/d, indicating possible saturation of absorption at doses > 30 mg/d. Urinary molybdenum was excreted in the form of molybdate, the terminal degradation product of tetrathiomolybdate. Copper in 24-hour urine before treatment averaged ~4 mmol or 254 mg and was reduced at week 12 and week 24. Total plasma Cu levels increased at the start of treatment, based on tetrathiomolybdate, which redistributes hepatic Cu stores into the blood, forming a three-part tetrathiomolybdate-Cu-albumin complex. The values decreased over time. Total plasma Cu levels closely tracked total plasma molybdenum, compatible with tripartite complex formation. At steady state, the vast majority of the molybdenum in the plasma was part of a tripartite complex with trace-free molybdate not bound to Cu. A correction factor was calculated for the ratio of Cu redistributed to the blood compartment per mole of Mo, which allowed the determination of free copper. Free Cu, assessed as non-ceruloplasmin Cu (NCC) adjusted for molybdenum, decreased with time. Summary WTX101 administration was accompanied by robust urinary molybdate excretion, indicating good drug absorption. Urinary copper excretion decreased over time in parallel with the decrease in free plasma copper, NCC-molybdenum corrected. Total plasma Cu levels tracked total plasma molybdenum, reflecting the redistribution of hepatic Cu and the formation of a tripartite complex in the blood. Conclusion WTX101 distributes hepatic Cu in the blood in the form of a tripartite tetrathiomolybdate-Cu-albumin complex. Non-drug binding Cu is excreted in the urine as molybdate. Urinary copper excretion is associated with an improvement in copper metabolism and may be a useful marker to monitor in WM patients treated with WTX101. WTX101 is a novel agent for the treatment of WD, and further understanding of the relationship between molybdate and copper metabolism is important to optimize treatment and monitoring.",,"Askari, F.

1135,Morbus Wilson: Sex-specific changes in methionine metabolism and mitochondrial function in a mouse model,"Background & Goals. Women with Wilson disease (WD) present with acute liver failure more often than men, while men have more neurological involvement than women. While these results have been attributed to hormonal factors, the gender differences may be related to epigenetic mechanisms and their relationships to mitochondrial function. The aim of the present study was to determine whether parameters of methionine metabolism and mitochondrial function differ by sex in an animal model of WD. methods. Tx-j mice, a model of WD, (n=9 males; n=8 females) were euthanized at 24 weeks of age to examine differences in transcript levels of genes associated with methionine metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. Targeted metabolomic analysis using LC-MS was performed on plasma samples to compare acylcarnitine profiles. An additional group (n=4 males; n=4 females) was treated with oral D-penicillamine (PCA) from 12 to 24 weeks to compare gender-specific responses to copper chelate. Results. Males had worse liver inflammation than females (1.6 +/- 0.6 versus 0.9 +/- 0.32; p < 0.05), steatosis was similar and mild, and there was no fibrosis. In males, hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels were lower and S-adenosylhomocysteine higher, resulting in a lower SAM to SAH ratio (2.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.8 +/- - 1; p<0.05), an indicator of global DNA methylation potential. DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) transcript levels were higher in females and Ndufab1 and Atp5j, which are associated with mitochondrial complex I and complex V, respectively, were lower in males. Metabolome analyzes revealed higher levels of unsaturated acylcarnitine 14:2 and saturated acylcarnitine 12:0 in women compared to men. PCA reduced hepatic copper levels by half in men but was ineffective in women. The histological response to PCA was similar in both sexes and there were no changes in SAM and SAH levels in response to PCA. In women, post-PCA Dnmt1 transcript levels were significantly downregulated, associated with higher 10-acylcarnitine levels, indicating an overall smaller improvement in mitochondrial function. Conclusions. Male and female mouse models of WD differ according to parameters of methionine metabolism, mitochondrial function, and in response to copper chelation treatment. These data provide insight into the gender differences seen in patients with WD and indicate the need to adjust chelation treatment to account for gender differences.",,"Medici, V.;Shibata, N.;Kharbanda, K.

1136,"An ongoing, multi-center, open-label, Phase 2 study of WTX101 in patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease","Background and Objectives WTX101 (bischolintetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational compound with a novel copper binding mechanism that is being tested in an ongoing prospective study to evaluate safety and efficacy in patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease (WD). Methods Patients with a confirmed WM diagnosis, > 18 years of age and treatment-naïve or <= 2 years on chelation or zinc therapy initially received 15 or 30 mg of WTX101 QD and at 6 weeks dosing was adjusted based on laboratory and clinical findings Criteria . Regular assessments included safety, liver disease status, neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), and parameters of copper metabolism. Results 28 patients were included in the study. At study entry, most patients were untreated or treated <= 28 days with WD therapy, only 5/28 treated > 90 days. Mean baseline non-ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) was elevated (3.5 mM), 25/28 had neurological manifestations at baseline, and mean UWDRS Part III was 22. Modified Nazer score ranged from 1 to 5. To Adverse events (AEs) included reversible elevated liver tests (n=5, including 3 related to dose escalation per protocol) and neutropenia (n=2). After the starting dose was reduced from 60 mg daily to 15-30 mg QD and dose escalation was limited to 60 mg QD, WTX101 was well tolerated with few AEs. Liver status (ALT, INR, and bilirubin) and modified Nazer score improved or remained stable in all patients. NCC (adjusted for molybdenum) decreased over the course of treatment. Other Cu measurements (exchangeable Cu, total serum Cu, 24-hour urinary Cu excretion) indicate a similar decoppering pattern. UWDRS Part III scores largely improved in patients with neurological manifestations or were stable in patients without neurological manifestations. Daily activity status (UWDRS Part II) showed a similar improvement. Summary WTX101 appears to be safe and well tolerated as initial therapy in patients with WM. Improvements in liver and neurological disorders, copper metabolism and daily activity status have been observed over time with WTX101 treatment. More data will be collected. Conclusion Further clinical evaluation of WTX101 is warranted to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the initial treatment of WD. The possibility of once-daily dosing will increase patient comfort and adherence to therapy.",,"Schilsky, M. L.;Askari, F. K.;Ferenci, P.;Ala, A.;Czlonkowska, A.;Nicholl, D.

1137,Usefulness of serum zinc level in predicting the severity of Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation. Zinc (Zn), a copper antagonist used to treat WD, can inhibit copper absorption in the gut by upregulating metallothionins (MTs). However, there was no study on the relationship between Zn and the severity of WD. Our aim was to assess serum Zn levels in a variety of liver diseases and examine its correlation with the new Wilson Index (WI) score (1), used to predict the severity of WM. Methods: Medical records of 26 patients with WD (8 WD with acute liver failure (ALF) and 18 WD without ALF) and 69 patients with non-WD (31 nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), 29 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and 9 undetermined cause of ALF) who had initial serum Zn data prior to disease diagnosis were reviewed at our tertiary hospital from 2005 to 2015. Disease-causing mutations were identified in all WD children and the new WI score was calculated overall. Corrected Zn was calculated by Corrected Zn<inf>Patient</inf> = (0.25xZn<sup>normal</sup>) + ((albuminnormal albuminpatient)x( Zn<inf>Patient</inf> - (0, 25xZn< sup>normal</sup>)) The correlation between the corrected Zn level and the score from the new WI was statistically analyzed by Pearson's correlation RESULTS: WD-ALF had a lower corrected Zn level compared to WD-non-ALF, NAFLD, AIH and undetermined cause of ALF (7.3 (5.2-11.6), 13.8 (6.1-20.2), 13.7 (11.2-16 .7), 9.9 (5.3–31.4) and 11.4 (7.6–17.8), P<0.05, respectively. Demographics and laboratory results are presented in the table. In fact, there was a significant correlation between the corrected Zn level and the new WI score in WM patients (r = -0.554, P value = 0.004).Conclusions: Serum Zn level can predict the phenotypic severity of WM A low serum Zn level can distinguish WD-ALF from undetermined cause of ALF en (1) Dhawan A, Taylor RM, Cheeseman P, et al., Wilson's disease in children: 37 years of experience and revised King score for liver transplantation.

1139,Liver transplantation in Wilson's disease with neurological impairment: evaluation in 4 patients,"Background: The aim of this work is to report our early experience on the benefits of liver transplantation (LT) in the management of persistent neurological symptoms in patients with Wilson's disease (WD). METHODS: We describe our findings in 4 WD patients with neurological impairment or symptoms treated by LT: 2 patients had transplantation due to worsening of neurological symptoms despite long-term appropriate medical management. The other 2 required LT for symptoms related to liver failure. Patients were evaluated using the modified Rankin scale and the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: The 4 patients experienced neurological improvement after LT. The pre-LT Rankin score of the 2 patients transplanted for neurological impairment was 4 compared to 3 and 2 after LT, respectively. The pre-LT Rankin scores of the 2 WD cases transplanted for liver failure were 1 and 2, respectively, compared to 0 in both cases after LT. The UWDRS score improved in 2 cases and remained stable in 1 case with less severe impairment. Brain MRI abnormalities were partially reversible in 3 patients and remained stable in 1 patient. Conclusions: These results suggest that LT could be considered for patients with neurologically impaired WM. © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright all rights reserved.",,"Laurencin, C.;Brunet, A.

1140,Zinc maintenance therapy after initial penicillamine chelation for the treatment of symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease in a resource-constrained setting,"Background: Experience with zinc in the treatment of symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease (WD) is limited. Aim: To study the efficacy of penicillamine followed by zinc in the treatment of symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed case records of 31 patients with symptomatic hepatic MM in whom disease severity (Child, MELD, Nazer, and nNew Wilson iIndex scores) and 24-hour urinary copper were 3 three Time points were compared—baseline at presentation, transition from penicillamine to zinc, and end of follow-up. Results: Of the 31 patients with symptomatic hepatic MD examined, 10 had associated neuropsychiatric manifestations of MD. Penicillamine was switched to zinc sulfate either for financial reasons (in 28 patients) or because of penicillamine side effects (in 33 patients). The child's grade was A in 6 six patients, B in 5 five, and C in 17 at presentation (baseline). The duration of initial penicillamine chelation therapy was 134 (2-320) weeks, the median (range) and subsequent zinc therapy was 363 (35-728) weeks. There was a significant improvement in liver function tests and disease severity scores (Nazer, nNew-Wilson index, Child, and MELD scores) in the transition from penicillamine to zinc compared to baseline. This improvement persisted through the end of the study period. 17 Seventeen patients with childhood C-cirrhosis were treated with penicillamine for 111 (2-320) weeks at presentation, followed by 344 (41-652) weeks with zinc, 15 of which had significant improvement in liver function and disease severity up to the end of the follow-up period -high. 3 Three of 31 study patients died at 284, 112 and 437 weeks. No patient underwent liver transplantation. Conclusions: Penicillamine followed by zinc may be a safe and effective treatment in a resource-constrained setting for symptomatic patients with hepatic WM in all baseline degrees of disease. Our data also suggest that some patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease can be managed medically while avoiding liver transplantation.",,"Gupta, P.;Choksi, M.;Goel, A.;Zachariah, U.;Sajith, K.

1141,Psychiatric comorbidity in Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is a relatively rare autosomal recessive disorder that causes copper accumulation in various organs, mainly the liver and brain. Psychiatric disorders represent a diagnostic and therapeutic problem in WM. PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant articles focused on psychiatric disorders in WD published between 1985 and 2016. 92 articles were included in this review, presenting the results of 35 observational and case-control studies and 57 case reports. This study discussed the findings on the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in WM, their impact on the lives of those diagnosed, and the effectiveness of available treatments on the psychiatric consequences of WM. Psychiatric disorders are frequently confirmed in WM, with a high prevalence of mood disorders, and contribute to poorer quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Because specific therapies for WD result in a good life expectancy, adherence to medication and clinical monitoring should be ensured through a multidisciplinary approach, including careful hepathological, neurological, and psychiatric evaluation and education of sufferers and their families.

1143,Yeast as a model for the identification of novel survival-promoting compounds for the treatment of degenerative diseases,"Programmed cell death (PCD) plays an important role in the development and normal metabolic function of organisms. Excessive cell death is the cause of many degenerative diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases and Wilson's disease, for which current therapies are inadequate. Current therapies mainly focus on reducing disease symptoms after cell death rather than blocking the cell death process itself. The latter can be achieved by either reducing the presence of the toxic trigger (such as protein aggregation in the case of many well-known neurodegenerative diseases) or by blocking the signaling cascade(s) leading to death. Given the high conservation in PCD processes between yeast and mammalian cells, in this Review we focus on yeast as a model organism to study PCD-related diseases and its use for drug discovery purposes. More specifically, we will provide a comprehensive review of new compounds identified in yeast-based drug screens that either decrease the amount of toxic triggers or inhibit PCD signaling cascades under PCD-inducing conditions.

It has mainly hepatic, neurological and ophthalmologic manifestations. Although osteoporosis, rickets, and early arthritis are common features of WD, they are underrecognized. Musculoskeletal manifestations very rarely lead to the diagnosis of the disease. Here we present a case of a 12-year-old girl who presented with a 3-month-old pathologic femoral neck fracture. WD was diagnosed upon investigation of the cause of the pathologic fracture, which was treated by performing a conventional McMurray intertrochanteric osteotomy. At the 6-month follow-up, the fracture had healed and the patient was able to walk with support. WD can be a rare cause of pathologic fractures. A high index of suspicion must be maintained in patients with pathologic fractures associated with neuropsychiatric or hepatic manifestations.

1146,The plausibility of maternal toxin exposure and nutritional status as factors contributing to the risk of autism spectrum disorders,"Recent research suggests that the maternal environment may be particularly important for the risk of developing autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In particular, maternal infections, micronutrient deficiencies, obesity, and exposure to toxic agents are likely to interact with genetic risk factors to disrupt fetal brain development. Aims: The aim of this work is to investigate the plausibility of maternal toxin exposure and nutritional status as causal factors in the development of ASD. Methods: This thesis provides an overview of current research investigating the hypothesis that maternal toxicity exposure and prenatal micronutrient intake are important modifiable risk factors for ASD. Results: Zinc, copper, iron and vitamin B9 were identified as specific micronutrients relevant to the etiology of ASD. Certain toxins induce a maternal inflammatory response that leads to fetal micronutrient deficiencies that disrupt early brain development. Importantly, maternal micronutrient supplementation is associated with a reduced risk of ASD. In addition, animal studies show that micronutrient supplementation can prevent the teratogenicity and developmental neurotoxicity of certain toxins. Discussion: These findings lead to the hypothesis that maternal infections, obesity, and toxic exposures (e.g., valproic acid, endocrine disrupting plasticizers, ethanol, and heavy metals) are environmental risk factors for ASD, leading to fetal micronutrient deficiencies due to maternal inflammatory response. It may be possible to use inflammatory markers and micronutrient status to identify women who would benefit from micronutrient supplementation or dietary interventions to reduce ASD risk. However, more research is needed to demonstrate a causal role for fetal micronutrient deficiencies and to clarify the underlying mechanisms that contribute to ASD.

Anti-smooth muscle antibody was 1:20 positive and liver biopsy revealed micronodular cirrhosis with abundant hyaline Mallory and stainable copper deposits. Liver histology was indicative of Indian childhood cirrhosis, while the presence of autoantibodies, elevated transaminases, and elevated globulin suggested autoimmune hepatitis.

1148,Copper(I) binding properties of copper scavengers used in the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the P-type copper ATPase, ATP7B, which transports copper out of cells and is therefore critical for biliary excretion of excess copper . WD is characterized by toxic accumulation of copper mainly in the liver and brain, resulting in liver disease and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Unlike many other genetic disorders, WD is treatable, primarily with copper chelation therapy, which mobilizes copper from the body and improves its urinary excretion. Although a number of decoppering agents are currently available, their Cu(I) binding affinities and interactions with essential cellular copper proteins have not been characterized quantitatively. Using an ESI MS-based approach, we determined the Cu(I) binding affinities of five key decoppering agents—penicillamine, trientine, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol, 2,3-dimercaptosuccinate, and tetrathiomolybdate—exploring their ability to bind Cu To extract (I) ions from two cellular Cu(I)-binding proteins that have different Cu(I)-binding affinities. We report that the Cu(I) binding affinity of decoppering agents varies by four orders of magnitude and depends on the number of sulfur atoms in the drug molecule.

1149,Characterization of ZEB2 enhancers during brain development,"The zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (ZEB2) is a transcriptional repressor that is an essential regulator of the nervous system during development. Heterozygous de novo mutations in ZEB2 are associated with several neurological defects, including Mowat-Wilson syndrome, due to haploinsufficiency of ZEB2 expression during development. Therefore, mutations in ZEB2 enhancers that regulate its neuronal expression could lead to a similar phenotype. However, ZEB2 enhancers have yet to be characterized. Using enhancer-associated ChIP-seq data, we identified 13 sequences in the Zeb2 locus that might function as neuronal enhancers during development. Using the zebrafish enhancer assay, we have characterized nine neuronal enhancers, with four functioning as notochord enhancers and two as specific neuron enhancers. Interestingly, the four notochord enhancers that drove a similar GFP expression pattern do not share their sequence homology, prompting us to further determine the transcription factors that activate these enhancers. We found the TF repertoire likely to regulate the activity of these enhancers required for spatiotemporal expression of ZEB2 during neuronal development. The characterized enhancers shed light on the mechanism of action of ZEB2 regulation and may serve as potential sequences to screen for mutations in patients in whom no mutation was found in the ZEB2 coding region.",,"Bar Yaackov, R.;Birnbaum, R.",2017,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.14174,0,0,
1150,Iron and copper in fetal development,"Copper and iron are both essential micronutrients. Since they can both accept and donate electrons, they play a central role in many energy-dependent chemical reactions. For example, copper is a critical component of the ferroxidase enzymes ceruloplasmin, hephaestin, and cyclops, as well as enzymes such as dopamine beta-monoxygenase, while iron is part of the catalytic site of many cytochromes and enzymes involved in fatty acid desaturation. It is therefore not surprising that copper and iron deficiencies, especially during pregnancy when cell proliferation and differentiation are very active, suboptimal nutrient status can lead to serious consequences. These problems can persist into adulthood, with an increased risk of mental health problems such as schizophrenia and, at least in animal models, hypertension and obesity. In this review, we look at what these issues are and how they can arise. We examine the role of copper and iron deficiency separately during fetal development, in terms of birth outcome, and then how problems with status in utero can have long-term consequences for offspring. We are investigating several possible mechanisms of action, both direct and indirect. Direct causes are, for example, reduced enzyme activity, indirect causes can arise, among other things, from changes in cytokine activity, a reduction in cell number or increased apoptosis. We examine a very important area of nutritional interactions between micronutrients and conclude that while we have made significant progress in understanding the relationship between micronutrient status and pregnancy outcome, there is still much to learn. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Gambling, L.;Kennedy, C.;McArdle, H.

1151,Rare ER Protein Misfolding Mistrafficking Disorders: Therapeutic Developments,"The presence of a functional protein in the right place in the cell is the result of the processes of transcription, translation, folding and transport to the right target. There are numerous diseases caused by protein misfolding, mainly due to mutations in the relevant gene. The consequences of this misfolding can be that proteins effectively lose their function, either by being removed from the cellular quality control machinery or by attaching themselves to the wrong intracellular or accumulate extracellular site. A series of mutations that cause proteins to misfold and affect transport to their final destination, e.g. B. cystic fibrosis, Wilson's disease and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 1, result in proteins that retain a partial function if their folding and transport are meant to be restored either molecularly or pharmacologically. In this review, we discuss several mutant proteins within this class of misfolding diseases and provide an update on the state of molecular and therapeutic developments and potential therapeutic strategies being developed to counteract these diseases.

1153,The role of MRI in the diagnosis and therapy monitoring of Wilson's disease,"Purpose: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare disorder of copper metabolism resulting from a mutation in the ATP7B gene. Diagnosis of WM is usually based on blood tests and clinical findings. In this case report, we aimed to highlight the contribution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of WD as well as in monitoring treatment. A 19-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of progressive dysarthria and nocturnal tremor in the right hand. Neurological examination revealed dysarthria, postural and actional tremor, and motor weakness in the lower extremities. The EEG was unremarkable. Kayser-Fleischer rings have been observed bilaterally. The blood test results were as follows: serum ceruloplasmin 16.3 mg/dL (normal: 25-63 mg/dL), serum copper level 32 µg/dL (normal: 70-140 µg/dL) and 24-hour copper excretion Urine 56.5 cups/day (normal 24-hour urine output 20-50 cups/day) Abdominal ultrasonography showed heterogeneous echogenicity of the liver with evidence of surface nodule formation. An abnormally high T2 signal was observed in the putamina, dorsal midbrain and pons on cranial MRI. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. Treatment with trientine and zinc was initiated. After one month of therapy, the patient was re-examined. There was a significant decrease in tremor with gain in motor function. A repeat MRI showed a significant decrease in previously detected signal abnormalities. Results: The MRI findings accurately reflected the clinical response to therapy. Conclusion: Although not a primary diagnostic tool, MRI in WM can be helpful in both making the diagnosis and documenting the response to treatment.",,"Ozturk, O.;Ozturk, S.",2017,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00234-017-1872-5,0,0,
1154,Thrombotic microangiopathy in the context of systemic diseases: Four cases from pediatric clinical practice,"Introduction: Thrombotic microangiopathies result from the interaction of predisposing factors and triggering events. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present four pediatric cases with unusual forms of thrombotic microangiopathy in the context of systemic diseases. Results: Case 1: 5 years old, acute pancreatitis with complement activation and HUS triad (hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure). Early treatment with eculizumab leads to rapid haematological and renal remission. MRI shows an anatomical variant (pancreas divisum) associated with a high risk of spontaneous pancreatitis. Recurrence of pancreatitis during treatment with eculizumab without signs of TMA. Genetic analysis reveals risk haplotypes in CHF, MCP and CFHR3-CFHR1 deletion. Pancreatitis triggered aHUS or vice versa? Case 2: 2 years old, acute myeloid leukemia M5, after haploidentical BMT, complete chimerism. After BMT, transfusion-dependent anemia, malignant hypertension, and proteinuria develop. Temporary stabilization after suspension from cyclosporine. Progressive disease with two-fold increase in creatinine, kidney biopsy shows TMA. Normalization of blood pressure and renal function under treatment with eculizumab, no proteinuria. Hemoglobin restoration, no need for transfusions. Material for genetic tests from saliva (blood cells from the donor), result is still pending. Case 3: 15 year old, previously healthy, presents with cholestasis and HUS triad. Ocular assessment shows Keyser-Fleischer ring. Copper in the urine and low ceruloplasmin confirm the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Hemolytic anemia only improved with treatment with Trientine. Progressive recovery of hemoglobin and renal function. Labeled complement activation, CFB antibody and CFHR5 variant. Case 4: 10 years old, Wilson's disease. Three years after liver transplantation, the HUS triad presents as part of a viral infection. Recovery after interruption of tacrolimus and everolimus treatment. Carrier of CHR1 and 3 homozygous deletions. Conclusions: These cases illustrate the relevance of considering TMA in non-aHUS-associated diseases in which complement activation and endothelial damage can trigger or result from complement activation. The relevance of complement gene polymorphisms as a TMA-predisposing condition is not well understood.",,"Rosales, A.;Madrid, A.;Munoz, M.;Quintero, J.;Alonso, L.;Chocron, S.;De Cordoba, S.

1155,Copper-associated hepatitis in dogs,"Copper-associated hepatitis is becoming increasingly common in dogs. The disease is characterized by centrolobular hepatic copper accumulation leading to hepatitis and eventually cirrhosis. The diagnosis can only be made by histological evaluation of the copper distribution and copper quantification in a liver biopsy. Treatment with the copper chelator D-penicillamine is the most commonly used treatment. In addition, a low-copper/high-zinc diet may help prevent the accumulation or re-accumulation of hepatic copper. Mutations in the copper metabolism genes COMMD1 or ATP7A and ATP7B have been associated with hepatic copper levels in Bedlington Terriers and Labrador Retrievers, respectively. In the Labrador Retriever, dietary copper intake is a major contributor to the disease phenotype.

1156,Zeb2 recruits HDAC-NuRD to inhibit Notch and control Schwann cell differentiation and remyelination,"The mechanisms that coordinate and balance a complex network of opposing regulators to control Schwann cell (SC) differentiation remain elusive. Here we show that the zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (Zeb2, also called Sip1) transcription factor is a critical intrinsic timer that controls the onset of SC differentiation by targeting the histone deacetylases HDAC 1 and 2 (HDAC1 /2) and the nucleosome recruits remodeling and deacetylase complex (NuRD) co-repressor complexes in mice. The Zeb2 deletion arrests SCs in an undifferentiated state during peripheral nerve development and inhibits remyelination after injury. Zeb2 antagonizes inhibitory effectors including Notch and Sox2. Importantly, genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed a Zeb2 target gene encoding the Notch effector Hey2 as a potent inhibitor of Schwann cell differentiation. Strikingly, a genetic Zeb2 variant associated with Mowat-Wilson syndrome disrupts interaction with HDAC1/2-NuRD and abolishes Zeb2 activity for SC differentiation. Therefore, Zeb2 controls SC maturation by recruiting HDAC1/2-NuRD complexes and inhibiting a Notch-Hey2 signaling axis, indicating the critical role of HDAC1/2-NuRD activity in peripheral neuropathies mediated by ZEB2 mutations caused.

1157,Clinical features of Wilson's disease in Peru: review of eight cases,"Aim: To describe the clinical characteristics of patients with Wilson's disease studied at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Neurologicas (INCN), Lima, Peru between 1995 and 2013. Mutation of the ATP7B gene. WD presents with hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, and ophthalmic and other manifestations. Neurological symptoms include parkinsonism, dystonia, and ataxia. The clinical course is highly variable and a delay in diagnosis is not uncommon. Diagnosis of WD is based on clinical, biochemical, and genetic analysis when genetic characteristics are available. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent or minimize enduring neurological complications. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all patients with a clinical diagnosis of WM followed by INCN (Movement Disorders Unit and Neurogenetics Research Center). Demographic and clinical data as well as biochemical parameters (especially serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper excretion); Neuroimaging and specialized consultations were retrieved from the clinical records. IRB approval was obtained from a local institution for this study. Results: Eight of 19 identified patients were included in the study. 87.5% (7) were male. Our WM patients had a mean age of 26 [17-44] years and a mean age at onset of 23.7 [12-44] years; the median time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 20.3 [3–72] months. Parkinsonism was the predominant phenotype in this group and together with dysarthria the two most common symptoms at onset (37.5%). The Kayser-Fleischer ring was confirmed in 62.5% (5) of the patients. The mean serum ceruloplasmin concentration was 12.5 mg/dl [2,3-23,4] and the mean 24-hour urinary Cooper excretion was 109.6 µg/24 hours [33,2-278] . The most common finding in MRI brain was changes in putamen signaling (50%), followed by thalamus (37.5%). 87.5% (7) of patients started treatment shortly after diagnosis and 75% (7) received penicillamine therapy. Conclusions: This is the first case series of WD in the Peruvian population. WD cases in our Peruvian cohort appear to be similar to those described in other populations; However, the diagnostic delay is higher than others reported around the world.",,"Sarapura, E.;Ramirez-Quinones, J.;Cornejo-Olivas, M.;Torres, L.",2017,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.26972,0,1,

Here we present the case of two clinically distinct manifestations of acquired copper deficiency syndromes secondary to excessive use of zinc-based denture adhesive over five years: myeloneuropathy and severe macrocytic anemia and neutropenia. Methods Extensive laboratory tests and histological examinations of the liver and bone marrow were necessary to rule out other disease processes and to make the diagnosis of copper deficiency. Results The initial presentation consisted of myelopathy affecting the posterior columns. Serum and urine copper were significantly decreased and serum zinc was increased. At the second visit (five years later) several hematological abnormalities were noted. Serum copper was again decreased while serum zinc was increased.

1162,Drosophila melanogaster models of metal-related human disease and metal toxicity,"Iron, copper and zinc are essential transition metals as they are required in a wide range of biological processes. Organisms have evolved to absorb metals from food and maintain adequate amounts of each metal to avoid adverse effects related to deficiency, excess, or misplacement. Interestingly, the major components of the metal homeostatic pathways are conserved, with many orthologues of human metal-related genes in Drosophila melanogaster being identified and characterized. Drosophila has gained recognition as a useful model for studying human diseases, including those caused by mutations in signaling pathways that control cellular metal homeostasis. Flies have many advantages in the laboratory, such as: B. a short life, easy handling and inexpensive maintenance. In addition, they can be raised in large numbers. In addition, flies are highly valued as they provide a significant set of genetic tools to answer some of the unsolved questions about disease pathology, which in turn could contribute to our understanding of metal metabolism and homeostasis. This review article recapitulates the metabolism of the major transition metals, namely iron, zinc, and copper, in Drosophila and the usefulness of this organism as an experimental model to explore the role of metal dyshomeostasis in various human diseases. Finally, a summary of the contribution of Drosophila as a model for metal toxicity testing is given. Copyright © 2017 by the authors.

1164,Delivery of copper-chelating trientine (TETA) to the central nervous system by surface-modified liposomes,"The existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) complicates the treatment of many central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including the copper storage disease, Wilson's disease. Its CNS symptoms pose a serious problem since therapeutics for Wilson's disease do not cross the BBB. One strategy to overcome this obstacle is to deliver drugs across the BBB using colloidal carrier systems such as liposomes. The aim of the present study was to encapsulate triethylenetetramine (TETA), a copper chelating agent, in surface-modified liposomes and to study its permeation through the BBB. Liposomes have been modified with cationized bovine serum albumin or penetratin, a cell-penetrating peptide. Liposomes have been characterized in terms of size, PDI, zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency. Size ranged from 139.4 +/- 1.9 nm to 171.1 +/- 3.5 nm with PDIs below 0.2. The zeta potentials of vectorized liposomes were at least 6.9 mV higher than standard liposomes. Cryo-TEM images revealed liposomal structure, integrity, and structural and size similarity between loaded, unloaded, vectored, and non-vectored liposomes. In vivo experiments in rats showed up to 16-fold higher brain uptake of TETA in vectorized liposomes compared to free TETA or TETA in non-vectored liposomes, demonstrating successful delivery to the brain using targeting surface modifications. Tissue analysis showed that TETA levels in the brain were high enough to treat Wilson's disease.

1165,Chelation in metal poisoning - principles and paradigms,"This review provides an update on the general principles for the study and use of chelating agents in the management of metal toxicity. The clinical use of the ancient chelating agents EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetate) and BAL (2,3-dimercaptopropanol) is now limited due to the inconvenience of parenteral administration, their inherent toxicity, and the tendency to increase neurotoxicity of several metals. The hydrophilic dithiol chelators DMSA (meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) and DMPS (2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonate) are less toxic and more efficient than BAL in the clinical management of heavy metal poisoning and are available as capsules for oral use. For copper overload, DMSA appears to be an effective antidote, although D-penicillamine is still widely used. The thiols are inefficient in iron chelation because iron has a higher affinity for ligands with nitrogen and oxygen, but the new oral iron antidotes deferiprone and desferasirox have entered the clinical field. Comparisons of these agents and deferoxamine infusions are ongoing. General principles for the research and development of new chelating agents are briefly outlined in this overview.

Methods: Between December 2010 and May 2015, a retrospective analysis of case records in the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and gastroenterology was performed, including pregnant women diagnosed with chronic liver disease prenatally or during pregnancy. Results: The incidence of chronic liver disease during pregnancy was 50 out of 10,823 births (0.4%). 26 women with chronic liver disease had 50 pregnancies during the study period. Fifty percent of the women had cirrhosis. Maternal complications occurred in 22% of the study group. Variceal bleeding occurred in 4% and hepatic decompensation occurred in 16%. There were two maternal deaths (4%). Birth complications such as preeclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage and puerperal infection occurred in 18%, 14% and 18%, respectively. Abortions occurred in 34%, in cirrhotic patients in 55% and in patients without cirrhosis in 4.8%. The live birth rate of 76% was significantly higher (p<0.014) in the non-cirrhotic group than in the cirrhotic group. Conclusion: Pregnancies with chronic liver disease are associated with a high miscarriage rate.

1171,"Late onset Wilson's disease, dementia, Ekbom syndrome and Whittera","Aim: The aim of this study is to describe a patient with late-stage Wilson's disease, dementia and Ekbom syndrome. Background: Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from a mutation in the ATP7B gene that causes impairment of the biliary excretion of copper and its accumulation first in the liver but eventually in the brain and other tissues. Ekbom syndrome is characterized by the patient's strong belief that they are infested with parasites originating from the skin, mouth, eyes, or genital region. Methods: We report the case of a patient with an atypical presentation of Wilson's disease with Ekbom syndrome. RESULTS: A 69-year-old man with chronic liver disease was referred to the neurology group to assess cognitive impairment, mainly executive discomfort and episodic memory deficits, that had begun 3 years earlier. The neurological examination showed only flutter tremor. At follow-up, the patient's condition deteriorated and he became restless, aggressive and confused. After 6 months, he began to say that bugs were moving through his skin, which were not observed by his relatives. He subsequently developed extrapiramidal symptoms with bradykynaesia and muscle stiffness. Brain MRI showed diffuse white matter hyperintensities and cortical atrophy. Total serum ceruluplasmin was low in 2 cases: 6.9 and 11. Ophthalmological examination revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings in both eyes. A diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made and D-penicilamin was initiated with no clinical response. Conclusions: Ekbom syndrome is usually associated with psychiatric disorders or dementia, but its presence should raise suspicion of other neurodegenerative disorders since it may precede other classic signs. Although late-onset Wilson's disease is rare and not usually associated with early dementia, it can have an atypical course. It should be included in the differential diagnostic clarification of dementia, especially because it is potentially treatable in the early stages.",,"Germiniani, F.;Marques, P.;Zorzetto, F.;De Oliveira, L.;Teive, H.",2017,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.27087,0,0,

Background: The treatment of Wilson's disease remains a challenge for clinicians. Strict control of the various copper pools is required. Methods: case report. Therapy Control Formula: ""Free"" Serum Copper (FC) = Total Serum Copper - (Serum Coeruloplasmin x 3). Decoppering condition: FC <10mug/dL. Copper deficiency: FC <5mug/dL Results: A 25-year-old woman presented with a rapidly progressive tremor with severe functional effects lasting 1 year. She had asymptomatic chronic liver disease without portal hypertension. Physical Examination: Bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings and resting tremors in both upper extremities, both proximal and distal, of moderate amplitude. Severe tremors in both upper limbs occurred a few seconds after assuming an antigravity posture or performing a simple action (""wing flapping"" tremor). As soon as it emerged it was of increasing amplitude, extending to the entire body, torso, head and lower extremities. It would only go away when she brought her upper limbs back to the resting position. Dystonic postures of the right hand have occasionally been observed. No other abnormalities. Investigations: Normal serum copper, increased 24-hour urinary copper excretion and decreased serum ceruloplasmin. Normal liver function tests. She was compound heterozygous for the p.L1305P and p.H1069Q mutations in ATP7B. Brain MRI before treatment (Figure 1A): bilateral and symmetric hypointensity in globus pallidus and substantia nigra and hyperintensity in putamen, lateral thalamus, central pons and dorsal midbrain. She was initially treated with D-penicillamine, Zn and vitamin B6, with worsening of neurological symptoms and poor tolerability. D-penicillamine was discontinued and AT started. She had spectacular improvement 15 days after starting treatment and was asymptomatic at 4 months. It reached the decoppered state 7 months after the start of AT and was removed, leaving only the maintenance zn (FC 5-10mug/dL). A brain MRI 4 years after treatment was normal (Figure 1B).

1173,"WTX101 - a novel copper-modulating agent for Wilson's disease - demonstrates efficacy and safety in a multi-center, phase 2, open-label study","Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 24-week treatment with WTX101 in patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease (WD). Background: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational first-in-class copper regulatory agent for the treatment of WD. Although WD therapies are available, there is a significant unmet medical need in terms of efficacy, side effects, and convenience of treatment. METHODS: Patients with WD aged > 18 years, treatment-naïve or treated for = 2 years with chelation or zinc therapy initially received 15 or 30 mg of WTX101 once daily. After 6 weeks, the dosage was based on individual laboratory and clinical criteria. Assessments included copper control, neurological and disability status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), liver status, and safety. Results: Twenty-eight patients participated in the study. Mean non-ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) at baseline was elevated (3.6 muM) and 23/28 had neurological manifestations (mean UWDRS part 3 score 22.8). The primary endpoint of copper control was met in 79% of patients (p<0.001). The mean reduction in NCC levels was 77% (p<0.0001). Both neurological status (p<0.0001) and disability (p<0.001) improved as measured by UWDRS part 3 and 2, respectively. In addition, liver status, measured by modified Nazer score, improved in the majority of the patient stabilized or improved. Treatment with WTX101 was generally well tolerated, with most reported adverse events being mild (Grade 1) to moderate (Grade 2). Reversible liver laboratory elevations were observed in 39% of patients and these elevations were generally mild to moderate, asymptomatic and resolved with dose adjustments. No initial drug-induced neurological deterioration was observed at the start of treatment with WTX101. Conclusions: Once-daily treatment with WTX101 has the potential to rapidly lower and control free copper and improve neurological status and disability in patients with WM. In addition, WTX101 was generally well tolerated and no cases of neurological deterioration were observed after initiating treatment with WTX101. Along with its simplified dosing, WTX101 has the potential to fill the unmet need at WD. Further clinical evaluation of WTX101 is warranted to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the treatment of WD.",,"Bega, D.;Ala, A.;Askari, F.;Bronstein, J.;Czlonkowska, A.;Ferenci, P.;Nicholl, D.;Weiss, K.

1174,"Neurological deterioration in patients undergoing treatment for Wilson's disease: incidence, causes, and outcomes","Aim: To study the pattern of neurological deterioration (NW) in patients undergoing treatment for Wilson's disease (WD). Background: WM is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Treatment involves copper chelation and can reverse neurological disability and prevent disease-related mortality. However, some patients develop worsening neurological symptoms during treatment. This may be medication-induced or due to noncompliance, disease progression, intercurrent illnesses, or emerging psychosis.a,b Methods: From 2005 to 2016, we prospectively recruited 120 consecutive patients attending our Wilson disease clinic and followed their neurological disability during treatment using from Tier 2 of the Global Assessment Scale for Wilson disease (GAS for WD).b All received penicillamine (125-2000 mg/day) except 5 who received trientine (300-1800 mg/day). Results: Among the 120 patients (72 male; 48 female) we observed 64 cases of NW in 44 patients (30 male). The earliest signs of NW were irritability or worsening of dysarthria, Wilson facies, or Kayser-Fleischer rings. Non-adherence to treatment was the most common cause and was observed in 16 patients during the early intensive phase of copper chelation and in 18 patients during the maintenance phase. Most of these patients were left untreated several times. Drug-induced NW was observed in 12 patients; 11 on penicillamine (mean dose 900 mg; range 750-1750 mg) and 1 on trientine (900 mg). The time between the start of treatment and NW varied greatly (mean 2.8 months; range 0.5-14 months). In 10 patients, such deterioration was reversible over a mean period of 1.2 months (range 0.5-4 months) with a short dose reduction of the drug. However, in two cases this resulted in long-term disability. NW due to disease progression was observed in four patients in the first few months of treatment initiation and improved with continued copper chelation. Emerging psychosis and intercurrent illness accounted for 11 and 3 cases of NW, respectively. These also improved with continued chelation. Conclusions: NW is observed in over a third of patients undergoing treatment for WM, with non-compliance being the most common cause. Monitoring neurological disability using the GAS-for-WD scale makes it possible to detect such deterioration, identify its cause, and respond appropriately (by encouraging compliance, down-titrating the dose, or continuing the course of treatment).",,"Aggarwal, A.;Bhatt, M.",2017,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.27087,0,1,
1175,Follow-up of liver fatty degeneration and fibrosis in children with Wilson's disease using transient elastography (Fibroscan),"Aims and study: Liver involvement in children with Wilson's disease ranges from simple steatosis, steatohepatitis to severe fibrosis. Pharmacological treatment is aimed at preserving liver function and improving the clinical condition of patients. Transient elastography (Fibroscan Echosens, France) has been used in many chronic liver diseases for the non-invasive assessment of liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis. Our aim was to assess the change in liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis and selected laboratory markers of liver function over time in children with Wilson's disease using Fibroscan. METHODS: We included 33 children (19 women) with a mean age of 11.5 years with Wilson's disease who were treated with either zinc or D-penicillamine. Patients with acute liver failure were excluded. At baseline and after a mean period of 1.5 years, all patients underwent Fibroscan examinations with a mean (M) probe to assess liver stiffness (E) and steatosis (Controlled Attenuation Parameter, CAP). At the same time, repeated laboratory tests of liver function were carried out. The Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis. Results: At baseline, our patients presented with slightly elevated liver enzymes ALT-49.5 U/I (27.5-69), AST-34.5 U/I (25.5-45.5), GGTP-26 U /I (19.5-35.5) and well preserved liver function INR-1.1 (1.05-1.16) [median, lower, upper quartile]. Initial Fibroscan showed normal median liver stiffness of 4.4 kPa (M-probe) (4.0-5.4) and slightly elevated liver steatosis of CAP-257 dB/m (235-283) [median, lower , upper quartile]. After a period of 1.5 years, we found a decrease, but not statistically significant, in ALT, AST and INR in our patients. Only GGTP was significantly lower than baseline results (p=0.02). Likewise, we found no significant difference in hepatic steatosis (CAP) or liver stiffness by Fibroscan compared to baseline and repeat measurements. Conclusion: 1. Liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis do not appear to improve significantly in the short-term follow-up of children with Wilson's disease, as based on Fibroscan measurements. 2. Transient elastography (Fibroscan) can be safely used to monitor liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis in children with Wilson's disease.",,"Janczyk, W.;Dadalski, M.;Socha, P.",2017,April,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000516381.25680.b4,0,1,
1176,The first study of the prevalence of Wilson's disease in a Portuguese population,"Aims and Study: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder responsible for abnormal tissue copper deposition. The worldwide prevalence is estimated at 1 in 40,000, although recent studies suggest a possible underdiagnosis. Studies on epidemiological information on WD in Portugal are lacking. The primary aim of the study was to estimate disease prevalence and incidence. Secondary objectives focused on a descriptive analysis of the main clinical, pathologic, and biochemical features of WM progression in this population. METHODS: The study design was retrospective and included MV patients of all ages followed between 1995 and 2015 with a minimum follow-up period of 3 months and confirmed to be born in the northern region of Portugal. Patients were identified using the Portuguese National Health Service's clinical coding system, which is based on clinical data from thirteen Portuguese hospitals, a histological assessment of liver biopsy and hospital prescription records. A statistical analysis was performed to determine possible clinical-analytical correlations by Chi-Square, Mann-Whitney-U, Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. Results: We identified and collected clinical data from 94 WM patients, six of whom died. The prevalence of WD over the past 20 years was 1/37,000 with a current prevalence of 1 per 45,000 population and an incidence of 1 per million population/year. Pediatric age of presentation occurred in 55.8%, with a median age at diagnosis of 16.6 years (12.3-20.8) and male gender in 53.2%. The mean follow-up time was 15.2 +/- 8.8 years. In 54.8%, predominant liver disease was the most common form of presentation, of which 37.0% with cirrhosis; mixed neurological/hepatic symptoms in 17.9% and predominant neurological presentation in 10.7%. Neurological symptoms were associated with later disease onset (p=0.001) and a higher presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings (p<0.001), detected in 27.0% of all patients. Liver transplantation was performed in 23.9%. In terms of therapy, penicillamine was the most commonly used, with side effects observed in 24.8% of patients and trientine used in 41.0% of patients at some stage of the disease. A significant decrease in hepatic liver enzymes was observed 6 and 12 months after the start of therapy (AST: p=0.002; ALT: p=0.002), which was not observed for urinary copper excretion. Conclusion: This study represents a further step towards a better understanding of the epidemiological, clinical and disease management of WM in the region of Northern Portugal, which appears similar to previously published work in other countries. Since more than half of WM patients are diagnosed in pediatric age, efforts should focus on developing tools aimed at establishing early diagnosis for better disease management.",,"De Sousa, B. R. R.

1177,Disorders of hepatic copper secretion: Wilson's disease and pleomorphic syndromes,"Wilson disease (WD) is a rare disease with a higher prevalence than previously thought. Caused by genetic variations that target the copper (Cu)-transporting P-ATPase Atp7b and disrupt hepatic Cu elimination, Atp7b truncations are associated with early severe liver disease and missense mutations with the late presentation of neurological disorders . Asymptomatic onset and false unimportance of initial symptoms often delay crucial early diagnosis and life-saving treatment. The occasional acute liver failure permanently threatens the life of patients with WM. The severity and progression of the disease are highly dependent on the genetic background that organizes the response to the oxidative damage induced by the elevated levels of free Cu. In this review, the authors focus on prevalence, genetics, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and treatment options in WM. They also discuss the new association of cuprotoxicosis with pleomorphic syndromes, of which MEDNIK is the first example, generated by genetic variations disrupting the universal mechanisms of protein transport and thus disrupting the trafficking of Atp7b associated with Cu excretion .

1178,Wilson disease,"Purpose of Review: This article provides an overview of the clinical features of Wilson's disease, focusing on the neurological and psychiatric abnormalities, and addressing the diagnostic work-up and treatment approaches to manage the disease. Recent Findings: The list of known mutations that cause Wilson disease is growing, but advances in genetic testing may soon make it possible to perform routine genetic testing on people suspected of having Wilson disease. Summary: Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder with multiple manifestations that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any person with unexplained neurological, psychiatric, or hepatic dysfunction. Appropriate diagnostic testing should be performed expeditiously and treatment initiated and continued promptly, since failure to diagnose and treat Wilson disease will result in progressive and ultimately irreversible damage to the neurological and other systems.

1179,Atypical clinical and radiological features of Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism that causes hepatic, neurological, and other systemic manifestations. The diagnosis must be considered in a young patient with chronic liver disease and neurological manifestations. Case Report: In our case, a young man presented with insidious and gradually progressive difficulty walking and sitting. On examination, the patient had a dazed look and was unable to vocalize. On motor examination, dystonia and exaggerated deep reflexes (figure shown) were present. The Kayser-Fleischer ring was visible to the naked eye on both sides. His serum ceruloplasmin was decreased, serum copper was slightly elevated, and his 24-hour urinary copper excretion was approximately 10 times normal. His USG abdomen showed liver with grossly altered echo. Brain MRI had a ""giant panda facial appearance"" with white matter abnormalities (Figure 1). Discussion: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive congenital disorder of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene. In Wilson's disease with neurological presentations, the sympathatology is predominantly extrapyramidal, such as dystonia, tremor, dysphasia, dysarthria, and ataxia. Our case had neurological manifestations, predominantly dystonia, dysarthria, and cognitive impairment. Brain MRI showed white matter involvement in the bilateral frontal cortex along with features typical of those seen in Wilson's disease. These white matter abnormalities are rare and have been rarely reported. Our patient was treated with zinc due to the unavailability of trientine and tetrathiomolybdate and showed improvements in neuropsychiatric aspects. Conclusion: A high index of suspicion is required when dealing with adolescents and young adults with abnormal movements and neurobehavioural disorders. A high level of suspicion and early detection of WM are crucial as the diagnosis can easily be overlooked, but if diagnosed at an early stage and treated appropriately, the patient can lead a normal life.",,"Goyal, S.;Dabla, S.;Sharma, B.;Yadav, K.",2015,Juneï¿½July,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2015.07.158,0,0,
1180,Nanoparticles encapsulated with trientine dihydrochloride for copper chelation therapy in the rat model of non-Wilsonian brain copper toxicosis,"Trientine fails to alleviate brain copper overload and neurological manifestations in patients with Wilson's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered trientine-loaded nanoparticles compared to conventional trientine over 90 days in the Wistar rat model of non-Wilsonian brain copper toxicosis. High-performance liquid chromatography, atomic absorption spectrophotometry, biochemical estimation, neurobehavioral and histopathological studies, and the preparation of nanoparticles and their physicochemical characterization were performed. Trientine nanoparticles showed an average size of 351 nm and less than 34% trientine release. Pharmacokinetic studies showed increased levels of trientine in the brain of the nanoparticle-based trientine administration group compared to the conventional trientine administration group. Conventional and nanoparticle-based trientine therapy resulted in significantly improved neuromuscular coordination and memory along with a concomitant increase in urinary Cu levels and acetylcholinesterase activity in the rat model of Cu toxicosis. Conventional trientine therapy resulted in negative rhodanine staining of liver and brain sections, confirmed by 63%, and a 16% reduction in copper levels in liver and brain, each compared to the untreated Cu-poisoned group. However, liver and brain sections of the nanoparticle-based trientine therapy group showed grade 1 copper and no copper deposits, as evidenced by a 46% and 28% reduction in liver and brain copper levels, respectively, compared to the untreated copper-poisoned group. Taken together, the present study provides the first in vivo evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of trientine nanoparticles in chelating more copper in the brain and alleviating neurological deficits, even at half the dose administered with conventional trientine therapy .",,"Pal, A.;Vasishta, R.

1181,Spatial investigation of elemental distribution in Wilson's disease liver after D-penicillamine treatment using LA-ICP-MS,"Currently, the copper chelator D-penicillamine (DPA) is the first-line treatment for Wilson's disease (WD), which is characterized by excessive copper overload. Lifelong DPA treatments aim to reduce harmful excess copper retention in the liver and other organs. Although DPA shows a positive effect in many patients, it can cause serious side effects. Despite several years of copper chelation therapy, discontinuation of DPA therapy can be associated with rapidly progressive liver failure, indicating a high residual copper load in the liver. To study the spatial distribution of residual copper and other elements such as zinc and iron in liver samples from rats and humans after DPA treatment, high-resolution (spot size of 10 mum) inductively coupled plasma laser ablation mass spectrometry (LA -ICP- MS) imaging methods applied. Untreated LPP<sup>-/-</sup> rats, an established animal model of WD, showed high total copper concentration and copper distribution from hotspots distributed throughout liver tissue. In contrast, a low (> 2-fold decrease) total copper concentration was found in the liver of DPA-treated animals. Importantly, however, the copper distribution was very inhomogeneous, with lowest concentrations in close proximity to blood vessels, as observed using a novel zonal analysis. A human liver needle biopsy from a DPA-treated WM patient supported the finding of inhomogeneous copper deposition after chelation therapy. In contrast, comparatively homogeneous distributions of zinc and iron were observed. Our study indicates that high-resolution LA-ICP-MS analysis of liver samples is excellent for monitoring the effectiveness of chelator therapy in WM patients.

1182,Wilson's disease in China,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The incidence is higher in China than in western countries. ATP7B is the causative gene and encodes a P-type ATPase involved in holoceruloplasmin synthesis and copper excretion. Disease-causing variants of ATP7B disrupt the normal structure or function of the enzyme and cause copper deposition in multiple organs, resulting in various clinical manifestations. Given the variety of presentations, misdiagnoses are not uncommon. Genetic testing plays an important role and has gradually become a routine test in China. The first Chinese spectrum of disease-causing ATP7B mutations has been established. As a curable inherited disease, most WM patients have a good prognosis with early diagnosis and chelation treatment. However, there are relatively few clinical trials in China, and most treatments are based on expert experience and evidence from other countries. There is a need to study and develop appropriate therapies specifically for Chinese WM patients.

During this time, the importance of these elements to human disease was increasingly recognized, including their contribution to the global burden of disease. New analysis methods make it possible to relate biomonitoring data to health outcomes. Future research using modern chemical methods will focus more on elementary speciation and on measuring lower concentrations, leading to further identification of adverse effects and critical organs. A great deal of knowledge about the essentiality and toxicity of trace elements in humans has accumulated over the last two decades, and at present the difficulties in establishing a range of acceptable oral intake levels for essential elements have largely been overcome. The biological monitoring of trace element concentrations in different media such as blood or urine is of great importance and an overview is given. As an example, a more detailed description of the biological monitoring of cadmium is given, explaining the biokinetics, including the role of metallothionein in modifying kinetics and toxicity. Finally, future challenges related to the risk assessment of newly developed metallic nanomaterials and metal-containing medical devices are discussed.

1185,"Efficacy and Safety of a Novel Copper Regulating Agent (WTX-101) for Wilson's Disease: Results of a Phase 2, Open-Label, Multicenter Study","Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in patients. newly diagnosed WD Background: WTX101 (bischolintetrathiomolybdate) is a novel copper-regulating agent under development for the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD). Although WD treatments are available, there is a significant unmet medical need in terms of efficacy, side effects, and ease of dosing. Design/Methods: Patients with WD aged > 18 years, treatment-naïve or < 2 years on chelation or zinc therapy initially received 15 or 30 mg of WTX101 QD. After 6 weeks, dosing was individually guided according to laboratory and clinical criteria. Assessments over 24 weeks included neurological and daily activity status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), liver status, copper parameters and safety. Results: Twenty-eight patients participated in the study. Mean non-ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) at baseline was elevated (3.5 µM), 23/28 had neurological manifestations (mean UWDRS Part III score 22), and all had liver involvement. Final results will be presented at the 2017 AAN Annual Meeting. Preliminary data show that total neurological scores (UWDRS Part III) and daily activity scores (UWDRS Part II) improved in patients with neurological manifestations. Liver status largely stabilized or improved. NCC (adjusted for molybdenum) decreased over the course of treatment. Other Cu measurements (exchangeable Cu, total serum Cu, 24-hour urinary Cu excretion) indicate a similar decoppering pattern. Overall, WTX101 was well tolerated. Adverse events included reversibly elevated liver enzymes in approximately 30% of patients and neutropenia. Conclusions: Once-daily WTX101 treatment for 24 weeks improved neurologic disease, liver status, and copper control in newly diagnosed WM patients. WTX101 appears to be well tolerated. A drug-induced, paradoxical, neurological deterioration was not observed. Further clinical evaluation of WTX101 is warranted to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the treatment of WD.",,"Bega, D.;Ala, A.;Askari, F.;Bronstein, J.;Czlonkowska, A.;Ferenci, P.;Nicholl, D.;Weiss, K.

1186,"Late onset Wilson's disease, dementia, Ekbom syndrome and white matter hyperintensities","Aim: The aim of this study is to describe a patient with late-stage Wilson's disease, dementia and Ekbom syndrome. Background: Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from a mutation in the ATP7B gene that causes impairment of the biliary excretion of copper and its accumulation first in the liver but eventually in the brain and other tissues. Ekbom syndrome is characterized by the patient's strong belief that they are infested with parasites originating from the skin, mouth, eyes, or genital region. DESIGN/METHODS: We report the case of a patient with an atypical presentation of Wilson's disease with Ekbom syndrome. RESULTS: A 69-year-old man with chronic liver disease was referred to the neurology group to assess cognitive impairment, mainly executive discomfort and episodic memory deficits, that had begun 3 years earlier. The neurological examination showed only flutter tremor. At follow-up, the patient's condition deteriorated and he became restless, aggressive and confused. After 6 months, he began to say that bugs were moving through his skin, which were not observed by his relatives. He subsequently developed extrapiramidal symptoms with bradykynaesia and muscle stiffness. Brain MRI showed diffuse white matter hyperintensities and cortical atrophy. Total serum ceruluplasmin was low in 2 cases: 6.9 and 11. Ophthalmological examination revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings in both eyes. A diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made and D-penicilamin was initiated with no clinical response. Conclusions: Ekbom syndrome is usually associated with psychiatric disorders or dementia, but its presence should raise suspicion of other neurodegenerative disorders since it may precede other classic signs. Although late-onset Wilson's disease is rare and not usually associated with initial dementia, it can have an atypical course. It should be included in the differential diagnostic clarification of dementia, especially because it is potentially treatable in the early stages.",,"Marques, P.;Larissa, B.;Germiniani, F.;Teive, H.

1187,Copper deficiency in patients with a prior diagnosis of AIDP,"Objective: Reporting a case of copper deficiency in previously reported AIDP. Background: Copper deficiency (CD) has been recognized as a cause of myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and hematological abnormalities. Its known causes are enteropathies, zinc intake, and gastric surgery, with approximately 20% of cases having no known etiology. DESIGN/METHODS: Case Report Results: A 32-year-old woman with a history of AIDP presented with ascending weakness, numbness, pancytopenia, and loss of bowel and bladder function on arrival. Her examination revealed severe paraplegia and hypoesthesia below the T3 level with a unique delayed ascending myotonic response with patellar stimulation. The patient also described rapid enamel loss in the preceding months, severe peripheral ataxia, and labile affect. If there was a history of AIDP, 5-day IV methylprednisolone was started. Towards the end of her IV steroid treatment, it was discovered that she had several nutritional deficiencies, namely: thiamine, copper and folic acid. Her investigation improved, although a cause remained unclear. After the steroid treatment was completed, plasmapharesis was started. The problem of low ceruloplasmin with low copper briefly put Wilson's disease in differential, specifically stopping copper supplementation until eliminated by 24-hour copper excretion. Meanwhile, plasmapheresis - known to reduce circulating copper - continued for possible CIDP treatment. Once Wilson's disease was ruled out, copper supplementation was resumed at 8 mg daily, showing slight improvement in symptoms and anemia leading to subsequent discharge. Conclusions: The presentation of CD mimicking chronic inflammatory demyelinating radiculopathy, particularly in the presence of prior AIDP, has proved challenging to diagnose and treat. Where the initial positive response to steroids and plasmapheresis suggested an inflammatory etiology, later ebbs and flows suggested otherwise. The question remains whether the first episode of AIDP the year before was actually the first presentation of this CD vs. CIDP.",,"Upadhyaya, P.;Ghodsianzadeh, F.;Romero, R.;Bhavaraju-Sanka, R.",2017,,,0,0,
1188,Non-Wilsonian hepatolenticular degeneration: Clinical and MRI observations in four families from South India,"Non-Wilsonian hepatolenticular degeneration (NWHD) is a heterogeneous neurological disorder secondary to chronic acquired liver disease. Genetic familial NWHD is rare, poorly understood, and often confused with Wilson disease (WD). We analyzed clinical and MRI profiles of NWHD patients who had no apparent cause of acquired liver disease, such as alcohol consumption or hepatitis. Six patients from four families (four males, two females, mean age: 17.0 +/- standard deviation 7.9 years) with chronic extrapyramidal disease resembling MV and imaging (abdominal ultrasound/MRI) evidence of cirrhosis were diagnosed examined. They lacked Kayser-Fleischer rings or biochemical and/or genetic evidence for WD. Clinical features included dystonia (n=6), parkinsonism (n=3), tremor (n=1), cerebellar ataxia (n=3), orofacial dyskinesia (n=1), behavioral abnormalities (n=3), and cognitive disorders decline (n = 1). Brain MRI showed T1-weighted hyperintensity in the pallidum (n=6), cerebellar crus (n=4), putamen (n=1), caudate (n=1), thalamus (n=1), and red nucleus ( n = 1) with T2-weighted shortening in some of these regions. Other findings included a giant cisterna magna (n=1), the face of a giant panda sign (n=1), and a thin corpus callosum (n=1). “Blooming” areas were noted on susceptibility-weighted images in two patients in the caudate (n=2) and putamen (n=1). The finding of T1 shortening differs from that in WD, where the majority of lesions are T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense. Extrapallidal T1 hyperintensity is also an exceptional observation in NWHD. The MRI appearance of intense T1 shortening coupled with the absence of elevated susceptibility changes suggests that the most likely deposited mineral is manganese. The association of this neurological disorder and liver cirrhosis in the absence of acquired liver disease is a disease entity in its own right. This syndrome can represent a disorder of manganese metabolism leading to its toxic deposition. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Nagappa, M.;Sinha, S.;Saini, J.

1190,Canine models of copper homeostasis disorders,"Copper is an essential trace nutrient metal involved in a variety of cellular processes. Hereditary defects in the copper metabolism lead to severe diseases such as Wilson's disease and Menkes' disease. In Wilson's disease, copper accumulation leads to liver cirrhosis and neurological impairment. A lack of genotype-phenotype correlation in Wilson's disease indicates the influence of environmental factors or modifying genes. In a number of non-Wilsonian forms of copper metabolism, the underlying genetic defects remain elusive. Several purebred canine populations are affected by copper-associated hepatitis, which shows similarities to disorders of copper metabolism in humans. Gene mapping studies in these populations offer the opportunity to discover new genes involved in copper metabolism. In addition, dogs are excellent models for the development of new treatment strategies due to their relatively large body size and long lifespan. An example is the recent use of canine organoids for disease modeling and gene therapy of copper storage disease. This review article addresses the opportunities that canine genetics offer for the discovery of genes involved in copper metabolism disorders. In addition, opportunities for using dogs in the development of new treatment modalities for copper storage disorders, including gene repair in patient-derived hepatic organoids, are highlighted.

1191,D-penicillamine in combination with inhibitors of hydroperoxide metabolism enhances the response of lung and breast cancer cells to radiation and carboplatin via H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-mediated oxidative stress,"D-penicillamine (DPEN), a copper chelator, has been used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, cystinuria, and rheumatoid arthritis. Recent evidence suggests that DPEN in combination with biologically relevant copper (Cu) concentrations produces H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in cancer cell cultures, but the impact of this on cancer cell responses Ionization radiation and chemotherapy are unknown. Elevated steady-state levels of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> were observed in MB231 breast and H1299 lung cancer cells after treatment with DPEN (100 microM) and copper sulfate (15 microM -M) detected ). Clonogenic survival demonstrated that DPEN-induced cancer cell toxicity was Cu dependent and mediated by glutathione degradation [using buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)] as well as inhibition of thioredoxin reductase [using auranofin (Au) ] was significantly enhanced prior to exposure. Catalase treatment inhibited DPEN toxicity, confirming H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> as a toxic species. Furthermore, pretreatment of cancer cells with iron sucrose enhanced DPEN toxicity, while treatment with deferoxamine, a Fe chelator that inhibits the redox cycle, inhibited DPEN toxicity. Importantly, DPEN also demonstrated selective toxicity in human breast and lung cancer cells compared to normal, non-transformed human lung or breast epithelial cells and enhanced cancer cell killing when combined with ionizing radiation or carboplatin. Consistent with the selective cancer cell toxicity, normal untransformed human lung epithelial cells had significantly less labile iron than lung cancer cells. These results support the hypothesis that DPEN mediates selective cancer cell killing as well as radiochemosensitization through a mechanism involving metal ion-catalyzed H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-mediated oxidative stress and suggest that DPEN could be reused as an adjuvant in conventional cancer therapy.

1193,A new risk locus in the ZEB2 gene for schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population,"The ZEB2 gene encodes the zinc finger E-box binding protein. As a key regulator of epithelial mesenchymal differentiation, ZEB2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cancer and its high level expression has been observed in glioma patients. Various mutations in this gene have been identified in patients with Mowat-Wilson syndrome. A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia conducted in Caucasians showed a significant association of rs12991836, located near the ZEB2 gene, with schizophrenia. Therefore, we conducted a case-control study to further investigate whether this genomic region is also a susceptibility site for schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population. A total of 1248 cases of schizophrenia (SCZ) (mean age +/- SD, 36.44 +/- 9.0 years), 1344 cases of bipolar disorder (BPD) (mean age +/- SD, 34.84 +/- 11, 44 years), 1056 major depressive disorder (MDD) cases (mean age +/- SD, 34.41 +/- 12.09 years) and 1248 healthy controls (mean age +/- SD, 30.62 +/- 11, 35 years) were recruited. In this study, we genotyped 12 SNPs using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. We found that rs6755392 showed a significant association with SCZ (rs6755392: adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=0.016; adjusted P<inf>genotype</inf>=0.052; OR (95% CI)=1.201 ( 1.073~1.344)). In addition, two haplotypes (TCTG, TCTA) were also significantly associated with SCZ. This is the first study to claim the association of the genetic risks of rs6755392 in the ZEB2 gene with schizophrenia. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,"Khan, R. A.

1197,Clinical features and outcomes in patients with Wilson's disease of the osseomuscular type,"Background: Wilson's disease of the osseomuscular type is a rare disease that often lacks typical hepatic and neurological symptoms and is easily misdiagnosed. In the past 10 years, eight Chinese patients with Wilson's disease of the osseomuscular type have been identified in our clinic. METHODS: Clinical information was collected from medical records and follow-up visits. Genetic testing was performed on each patient. Serum ceruloplasmin, Kayser-Fleischer rings, liver function, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and abdominal ultrasound were also evaluated. Results: The mean age at diagnosis is 12 years. The patients had their initial musculoskeletal disorders with arthralgia or joint deformity, while the hepatic or neurological symptoms were minimal. Most patients (6/8) eventually developed clinical neurological symptoms thereafter with a median interval of 36 months. All had normal liver function and low serum ceruloplasmin (< 0.1 g/L). Most patients (6/8) present with Kayser-Fleischer rings and abnormal hepatic ultrasound. The arthralgia was resolved with copper chelation therapy. Conclusions: Osseomuscular-type Wilson's disease presents without typical hepatic or neurological symptoms, making clinical diagnosis difficult. Serum ceruloplasmin, abdominal ultrasonography, ophthalmologic examination, and genetic testing help in diagnosis. Early diagnosis can initiate effective treatment and prevent further damage.

1200,Advances in understanding and treating liver disease during pregnancy: A review,"Liver disease in pregnancy is rare, but pregnancy-related liver disease can threaten fetal and maternal survival. It includes preeclampsia; eclampsia; Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet syndrome; acute fatty liver of pregnancy; hyperemesis gravidarum; and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Recent basic research has revealed the various etiologies involved in this disease entity. Given these advances, rapid diagnosis is essential for severe cases, since the decision to deliver immediately is important for maternal and fetal survival. The other therapeutic options have also been identified in recent reports based on clinical studies, and collaboration and information exchange between hepatologists and gynecologists is important for timely therapeutic intervention. Therefore, a correct understanding of the disease and the differential diagnosis of pre-existing and concomitant liver diseases during pregnancy contribute to a better prognosis. Therefore, here we review and summarize recent advances in understanding the etiologies, clinical courses and management of liver disease in pregnancy.

1201,Prospective assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of hepatic copper content determined from the whole core of a liver biopsy specimen,"Hepatic copper determination is an important test for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD). However, the method is not standardized, the diagnostic accuracy has not been evaluated prospectively, and the optimal cut-off value remains controversial. Accordingly, we aimed to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of hepatic copper content as determined from the whole core of a liver biopsy specimen. Patients for whom a liver biopsy was indicated were included consecutively. The hepatic copper content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. All assays were performed under careful quality control by a single technician. The WD diagnosis was based on the WD score or its combination with clinical follow-up results. A total of 3,350 consecutive patients underwent liver biopsy. Two liver biopsies with hepatic copper determination were performed in 691 patients, including 178 with WD. The mean liver content in WD patients was 770.6 +/- 393.2 µg/g dry weight (wt). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of hepatic copper for diagnosing WD in the absence of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis at the cut-off of 250 µg/g dry weight. were 94.4%, 96.8%, 91.8% and 97.8%, respectively. The most useful cut-off was 209 µg/g dry weight with a sensitivity and specificity of 99.4% and 96.1%, respectively. A total of 23.3% of patients without WD and PBC had a hepatic copper content of >75 µg/g dry weight. Conclusion: A liver biopsy sample greater than 1 mg dry weight can reliably reflect hepatic copper content and should be used for hepatic copper determination. Hepatic copper determination is a very valid method for diagnosing WD and the most useful cut-off value is 209 µg/g dry weight.

1202,<sup>1</sup>H NMR-based metabolomics study of a copper-loaded rat: A model of Wilson's disease,"Background and purpose: Wilson disease (WD), also known as hepatoleticular degeneration (HLD), is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder of copper metabolism that results in accumulation of copper in body tissues. In this study, rats fed a diet containing copper are used to reflect the clinical manifestations of WD and their organ lesions induced by copper toxicity are examined. To study the metabolic behavior of the ""decoppering"" process, penicillamine (PA) was used to treat copper-loaded rats because this chelating agent could excrete excess copper in the urine. To date, there have been limited metabolomics studies on WD, while the metabolic effects of copper accumulation and PA administration have yet to be determined. Materials and Methods: A combination of <sup>1</sup>HNMR spectroscopy and multivariate statistical analysis was applied to examine the metabolic profiles of the urine and blood serum samples collected from the copper-loaded rat model of WD with PA treatment . Results: Copper accumulation in copper-loaded rats is associated with increased blood serum lactate, creatinine, valine and leucine and decreased glucose and taurine levels. There were also significant changes in p-hydroxyphenyl acetate (p-HPA), creatinine, alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), dimethylamine, N-acetylglutamate (NAG), N-acetylglycoprotein (NAC) in the urine of these rats. Remarkably, the changes in p-HPA, glucose, lactate, taurine, valine, leucine and NAG were found to be reversed after PA treatment. However, there were no changes for dimethylamine, alpha-KG and NAC as a result of treatment. Compared to the controls, the concentrations of hippurate, formate, alanine and lactate were changed after PA application, which is probably due to their side effect. A tool called SMPDB (Small Molecule Pathway Database) is being introduced to identify the metabolic pathway affected by the copper-rich diet. Conclusion: The study has demonstrated the potential application of NMR-based metabolome analysis to gain further insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the disease due to WD.

1203,Functional analysis and drug response to zinc and D-penicillamine in stable ATP7B-mutated liver cell lines,"AIM: To study the effect of anti-copper treatment on the survival of liver cells expressing different ATP7B mutations in cell culture. METHODS: The most common Wilson disease (WD) mutations p.H1069Q, p.R778L and p.C271* found in the ATP7B gene encoding a liver copper transporter were examined. The mutations represent the major genotypes of the United States and Europe, China and India respectively. A human hepatoma cell line previously established to carry a knockout of ATP7B was used to stably express WD mutants. mRNA and protein expression of mutant ATP7B, cell survival, apoptosis and protein transport were determined. RESULTS: Low temperatures increased ATP7B protein expression in several mutants. Intracellular ATP7B localization was significantly impaired in the mutants. Mutants were classified as high, moderate, and no survival based on their viability when exposed to toxic copper. Survival of mutant p.H1069Q and to a lesser extent p.C271* improved with D-penicillamine (DPA) treatment, while mutant p.R778L showed a marked response to zinc (Zn) treatment. Overall, DPA treatment resulted in higher cell survival compared to Zn treatment; however, only combined Zn + DPA treatment fully restored cell viability. CONCLUSION: The data indicate that the fundamental effects of a genotype could be characterized by analyzing mutant liver cell lines. Copyright © 2016 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

1206,Plasma exchange and chelator therapy rescues acute liver failure in Wilson's disease without liver transplantation,"Objective: Wilson disease (WD) in patients with a New Wilson Index (NWI) score >= 11 is fatal and these patients are good candidates for liver transplantation (LT). However, plasma exchange and chelator therapy are essential and effective even in WM with a score >= 11. In addition, continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) with these treatments is essential for acute liver failure (ALF) in WM with hepatic encephalopathy because CHDF can exclude toxic metabolites that can damage the brain. Here we describe four rescued patients with ALF at WD and discuss the available treatment options. METHODS: We followed 11 male and 8 female patients presenting with WM at the Department of Pediatrics, Kumamoto University Hospital between 1999 and 2014. WM with ALF was diagnosed in 1 male and 4 female patients using a combination of clinical findings and biochemical tests. Results: The NWI score was >= 11 in cases 1 to 3. Cases 1 and 2 with hepatic encephalopathy received plasma exchange, CHDF, coagulation factor replacement therapy (CFRT) and LT. Cases 3 and 4 without encephalopathy reached stable status without LT by plasma exchange, blood infusion and CFRT. Conclusions: In WM patients with an NWI score >= 11, it is better to undergo LT, but there is a possibility of remission with plasma exchange and drug therapy even without LT. WM patients with an NWI score >= 11 can be rescued by conservative therapy if the ALF of WM does not present with ALF and hepatic encephalopathy. Therefore, ALF with hepatic encephalopathy itself is an indication for LT in WD.

1209,Structure and synaptic function of metal binding to amyloid precursor protein and its proteolytic fragments,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is ultimately linked to the amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, recent research indicates an important synaptic function of APP and APP-like proteins (APLP1 and 2). In this context, various neurotrophic and neuroprotective functions have been described for the APP proteolytic fragments sAPPalpha, sAPPbeta and the monomeric amyloid beta peptide (Abeta). APP is a metalloprotein and binds copper and zinc ions. Synaptic activity correlates with release of these ions into the synaptic cleft and dysregulation of their homeostasis is associated with various neurodegenerative diseases. Metal binding to APP or its fragments affects its structure and its proteolytic cleavage and hence its physiological function at the synapse. Here we summarize the current data supporting this hypothesis and provide a model for how these different mechanisms might be intertwined.

Although WD is one of the causes of myoclonus, it is rarely seen in WD and is usually seen as an associated finding. We report the case of an adolescent patient with WD who presented with cortical multifocal myoclonus of 6 months duration with later development of generalized dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome and cognitive decline. The Kayser-Fleischer ring was present on slit lamp examination. Serum copper, urine copper, serum ceruloplasmin, and brain magnetic resonance imaging were consistent with the diagnosis of WD. Copper chelation was started along with other symptomatic treatments and dietary changes. The myoclonus had resolved at 3 months follow-up with the improvement of other symptoms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Structured clinical interviews (patients and caregivers), repeat neurological assessments (afternoon and pre-sleep), extensive laboratory assessments, WD, RLS, and sleep-specific rating scales, and video polysomnography. RESULTS: Thirteen patients with WD (13/42 = 31.0%) clearly met the five diagnostic criteria of RLS; in eight patients (19.1%) the RLS burden was clinically significant. RLS was moderate in severity, evenly distributed between sexes, had a major manifestation in the evening and before bedtime, and had developed primarily after the clinical onset of WM (duration 10.2 +/- 14.5 years), while still young Average age (27.5 +/- 11.5 years). The known RLS-associated features were absent (normal iron and kidney values) or rare (positive family history, polyneuropathy). Compared to WM patients without RLS, patients with RLS were significantly older and had had WM longer. WD-specific RLS mimetics as well as RLS-confounding motor comorbidities (dystonia, tremor, chorea) were common and a diagnostic challenge; in difficult cases, differentiation was achieved by clinical observation of motor behavior in the evening or at night. Conclusion: RLS was common in this cohort of MM and may be causally related to MM. RLS should be included in the diagnosis of WM. In complex motor disorders, the differential diagnosis of RLS may require an evening/nocturnal examination and video polysomnography. Treatment with dopaminergic agents may be considered in WM patients with clinically significant RLS. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"Trindade, M.

1212,Trace metal regulation of neuronal apoptosis: from genes to behavior,"The genetically programmed form of neuronal death known as apoptosis plays a role in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease. Apoptosis is also responsible for neuronal death after traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, stroke, and seizures. The cognitive and behavioral consequences of all these disorders can be devastating. Unfortunately, the mechanisms that regulate neuronal apoptosis are complex. However, it is precisely this complexity that gives us a wide range of potential targets for the development of antiapoptotic strategies. Therefore, our laboratory is currently investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for neuronal apoptosis, with a special focus on the role of the metals copper, zinc and iron. Each of these metals is essential for the normal development and function of the central nervous system (CNS). However, imbalances, either too much or too little, can lead to neuronal apoptosis. In this review, we demonstrate the relationship between these metals in neurodegenerative disease and CNS injury, and the mechanisms controlling neuronal survival and apoptosis. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

1216,Usefulness of transient elastography to predict the outcome of Decopper therapy in a 13-year-old girl with acute or chronic liver failure due to Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal copper accumulation. Decopper is the effective treatment with an excellent outcome when the disease is diagnosed early [1]. However, the majority of patients with severe manifestation as acute liver failure or acute chronic liver failure urgently require liver transplantation [2]. Although a recent study showed that ultrasound-based transient elastography (Fibroscan) can be used to predict liver fibrosis with a cut-off value of 6.6 kPa [3], there were no clinically useful data from Fibroscan in untreated MM, specifically to predict this outcome of the initial treatment. METHODS: Outcome: A 13-year-old girl with 6 months of jaundice, ascites, and coagulopathy was referred from a local hospital for liver transplantation. In our hospital, Wilson's disease was diagnosed with positive KF rings, low serum ceruloplasmin, high urinary copper, and neuropsychiatric involvement. Liver biopsy was omitted because of unrecoverable coagulopathy. The transient elastography was measured with a value of 50.6 kPa (Fig. 1A). On admission, patients had grade I-II encephalopathy with altered consciousness and hyperreflexia. Treatment was started with depenicillamine and zinc sulfate. Four weeks later, clinical features and laboratory parameters were still abnormal (Table 1), but the Fibroscan value had decreased dramatically (17.8 kPa) (Fig. 1B), reflecting good treatment response and patient compliance . Conclusion: We present a case of WM with severe onset that may require liver transplantation. Liver transplantation is less possible if the waiting list is unpredictable, so decopper therapy is started after WM diagnosis. Response to treatment lasts up to 3 months after initiation [1], hence the new parameter is required to predict treatment outcome. In addition to the clinical response and the liver function test, we recommend transient elastography not only to predict the treatment outcome, but also to evaluate patient compliance in long-term follow-up.

1217,Copper homeostasis as a therapeutic target in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with SOD1 mutations,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons, and there is currently no cure or effective treatment. Mutations in a gene encoding a ubiquitous antioxidant enzyme, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), were first identified as the cause of familial forms of ALS. It is generally accepted that mutant SOD1 proteins cause disease through an increase in toxicity but not through a loss of physiological function. SOD1 is an important copper-binding protein and regulates copper homeostasis in the cell; therefore, toxicity of mutant SOD1 could result from disruption of copper homeostasis. In this review, we will briefly review recent studies implying the role of copper homeostasis in the pathogenesis of SOD1-ALS and highlight the therapeutic interventions that focus on pharmacological and genetic regulation of copper homeostasis to reverse the pathological process in SOD1-ALS to modify.

1218,Coexistence of Wilson's disease and sarcoidosis in a 35-year-old woman,"Background: The simultaneous diagnosis of two relatively rare coexisting diseases. Patients and methods: Description of clinical and laboratory findings. Results: A 35-year-old woman was referred to a neurology department for symptoms of upper extremity resting, postural and kinetic tremor, and head tremor. Diagnostic work-up revealed Kaiser-Fleischer rings in both eyes, high levels of copper in urine (200 g/24 h with normal [nv] < 100), low levels of ceruloplasmin (17.5 mg/dL-nv22-58) and slightly low serum copper (0.6 µg/mL - nv0.7-1.4). A diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made. However, the patient's chest X-ray showed enlarged pulmonary hili, which were confirmed by computed tomography to show enlarged lymph nodes. Angiotensin converting enzyme was 72.2 U/L (nv 12-68), spirometry was normal (FEV1: 87%, FVC: 88%, Dlco: 81%, FRC: 89%, RV: 82%, TLC: 84%) and she had no significant hemoglobin desaturation during a six-minute walk test (97% to 96%, walk distance: 360 m). Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed: cells: 0.132 x 10<sup>6</sup>, alveolar macrophages 44%, lymphocytes 42%, neutrophils 6%, mononuclear 3%, eosinophils 5% CD4/CD8 ratio: 2.57 The patient was started on triethylenetetramine (trientine) for her underlying condition and was follow-up for her stage I sarcoidosis. Three years later she remains clinically stable with no respiratory symptoms, with unchanged spirometry and computed tomography findings for sarcoidosis. The coexistence of these two disorders is rare. Only one similar case was reported. A 43-year-old man presented with symptoms and signs of cirrhosis and no neurological symptoms. Nine years earlier he had been diagnosed with sarcoidosis and treated with corticosteroids.

1220,Update on the clinical management of Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD), although relatively rare, is an important genetic metabolic disorder because highly effective therapies can be life-saving. It is a great mimic and requires a high index of suspicion for a correct and timely diagnosis. Neurological, psychiatric, and hepatological problems in WM are very nonspecific, and we discuss the most common clinical phenotypes. Diagnosis remains laboratory-based, and here we discuss the key challenges and pitfalls in the laboratory evaluation of WM, including the emerging role of genetic testing in WM diagnosis. WD is a monogenetic disorder but exhibits very high allelic heterogeneity with >500 disease-causing mutations identified, and new findings on phenotype-genotype correlations are also reviewed. The gold standard of therapy is chelation of excess copper, but many unmet needs exist due to potential clinical deterioration in treated patients and potential side effects associated with currently available chelating drugs. We also review the most promising new therapeutic approaches, including chelators that target specific cell types, cell transplantation and gene therapy.

1221,Surgical treatment in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder due to a mutation in the ATB-7B gene, which is a membrane-bound copper-transporting ATPase. The disturbed copper excretion leads to an increase in the serum level and an accumulation of copper in the body. Various signs can be observed in the liver, nervous system, kidneys, eyes and heart. There are also changes in blood chemistry. Objective: A 46-year-old patient with Wilson's disease presents in the treatment rooms of the Faculty of Dentistry in Plovdiv. She needs a complete dental care. She also had an ischemic stroke. METHODS AND RESULTS: Since the treatment plan began with tooth extraction under local anesthesia, a complete blood count and INR test were performed. Oral mucosa and bones were obtained by biopsy for evidence of pigment in these tissues. The biopsy results also showed accumulation of copper in them. Conclusion: It is a rare condition, approximately 1 in 40,000, which severely affects the liver and nervous system. It requires an in-depth analysis and discussion of the clinical and paraclinical approach to avoid possible complications and achieve the desired results.

1224,Liver transplantation in severe neurological forms of Wilson's disease; the French experience,"Introduction: The standard treatment for Wilson disease (WD) consists of chelating agents with copper or zinc salts. Liver transplantation (LT) is indicated for acute liver failure or advanced cirrhosis. The indication of LT in neurological forms without liver decompensation remains controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of LT in WM with severe neurological symptoms without decompensated liver function. methods. This is a retrospective study. From 2002 to 2015, LT was performed in France in nine patients (mean age 21 [12-42] years) because of severe neurological complications without neurological improvement despite drug treatment, without acute liver failure. All patients received chelating copper and 2 patients received chelating copper with zinc salts. Results. The neurological symptoms were heterogeneous and combined dystonic postures, akinesia, cerebellar ataxia, chorea and parkinsonian syndrome. The CHILD score was A for all patients at the time of transplantation. All patients had cirrhosis by native liver analysis. The mean interval between the diagnosis of WD and LT was 11.4 [5-28] months and the mean follow-up time after transplantation was 50 [2-42] months. Five patients (mean age 19 [12-30] years) with a mean follow-up of 80 [2-156] months had neurological improvement after LT, with a significant gain in quality of life. Four patients (mean age 24 [15-42] years) showed no significant improvement in neurological symptoms and died of infectious complications after a mean interval of 13 [2-36] months. Three of the four patients who died had severe Parkinson's disease and akinesia that restricted movements and swallowing. No correlation between genetic mutations and prognosis has been demonstrated. Conclusion: Liver transplantation is an effective treatment option in WM for patients with worsening neurological symptoms despite drug treatment, even in the absence of liver failure. Patients with an unfavorable outcome died of severe sepsis.

1226,Assessment of renal function in children with Wilson's disease. [Turkish],"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess renal function in Wilson's disease (WD) using urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and NAG/creatinine activity index. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty children of similar age and sex with WD were selected as the patient group and 37 healthy children as the control group for the study. NAG levels were calculated as mIU/L and NAG activity index was determined as mIU/mg. Results: While four (20%) patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis, chronic hepatitis, neurological WD, fulminant hepatitis, and acute hepatitis were reported in six (30%), five (25%), three (15%), and two (10% ) patients. Of the children, 13 (65%) received treatment with trientine and zinc and seven (35%) received treatment with D-penicillamine and zinc. Ten (50%) children had proteinuria, one (5%) had glycosuria, and one (5%) had microscopic hematuria. While mean urine sodium and creatinine levels were significantly lower compared to controls (p=0.048 and p=0.001, respectively), NAG and NAG index were significantly higher (p=0.049 and p=0.03). It was observed that clinical appearance was not effective on these parameters (p>0.05). No association was found between the Child-Pugh score and these parameters (p > 0.05). Conclusions: It was concluded that while WM itself and/or the drugs used to treat it have an adverse effect on renal function in children with WM, they do not affect the severity of liver damage and the clinical presentation of the disease.

In the present study, the patient was a 35-year-old woman with a nine-year history of drinking disorders (bulbar palsy) and dysphagia. Genetic analysis of the patient identified the Thr935Met and Pro992Leu mutations that result in discharge barriers in copper metabolism. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a susceptibility-weighted (SWI) hyperintense area in the bilateral substantia nigra and lens nuclei. These SWI observations indicated that ""mineral deposits"" were present. The present case demonstrates that the SWI hyperintense area in the bilateral lens nuclei, substantia nigra and red nucleus, combined with the patient's symptoms, indicates that there is a possibility of diagnosing WM if not proven by genetic analysis will. In addition, it demonstrates that systemic mineral removal treatment (including manganese, iron, and copper) can be successful for initial treatment of WD. Copyright © 2016 Spandidos Publications.

Ocular abnormalities have rarely been described in patients with this syndrome. Here we describe four patients (two men and two women; mean age 7 years) with MWS and ocular malformations. Ocular abnormalities included iris/retinal colobomas, atrophy or absence of the optic nerve, hyphema, and deep refractive problems, sometimes with serious consequences for vision. All ocular malformations were asymmetric and often unilateral, and all ocular segments were involved, similar to the previously reported nine MWS cases with ophthalmic malformations (iris/chorioretinal/optic disc coloboma, optic nerve atrophy, retinal epithelial atrophy, cataract, and corectopia). In the human embryo, ZEB2 is expressed in the lens and neural retina. Using the present report and data from the literature, we aimed to determine whether or not the presence of ocular manifestations might be due to a specific type or location of mutations. We concluded that the presence of ocular malformations, although a rare feature in MWS, should be considered part of the clinical spectrum of the disease.

It is caused by heterozygous de novo loss-of-function mutations, including nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, and deletions in ZEB2 at 2q22. ZEB2 encodes the zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox-2 protein, which consists of 1,214 amino acids. Here we report 13 nonsense and 27 frameshift mutations from 40 newly identified MWS patients in Japan. Although the clinical findings of all Japanese MD patients with nonsense and frameshift mutations were quite similar to previous reviews of MDs caused by nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, and ZEB2 deletions, the frequencies of microcephaly, Hirschsprung's Disease and urogenital/renal abnormalities very similar were small. The patients carried mutations spanning the region between amino acids 55 and 1204 in wild-type ZEB2. There was no apparent genotype-phenotype correlation among patients. A transfection study showed that the cellular level of the longest form of the ZEB2 mutant protein harboring the p.D1204Rfs*29 mutation was remarkably low. The results showed that the frameshift mutation at the 3' end of ZEB2 causes MWS due to ZEB2 instability. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Yamada, Y.;Nomura, N.;Yamada, K.;Matsuo, M.;Suzuki, Y.;Sameshima, K.;Kimura, R.;Yamamoto, Y.;Fukushi, D.;Fukuhara, Y.;Ishihara, N.;Nishi, E.;Imataka, G.;Suzumura, H.;Hamano, S.

Slight increases in iron levels in certain brain regions, sometimes as little as 2-fold, can have devastating effects on brain function. In this current review, we will first discuss changes that occur in brain iron homeostasis during healthy aging and longevity, and how changes in its concentration and distribution may accelerate various neurodegenerative diseases. Alterations in the metal ion homeostasis of other metal ions, namely copper and zinc, also occur in neurodegenerative diseases and are discussed. In the past five years, the use of iron chelators to slow disease progression and even improve clinical signs in some neurodegenerative diseases has been reported; Clinical studies have confirmed its effectiveness in certain neurodegenerative diseases, namely Friederich's ataxia and Parkinson's disease. The development of new chelators capable of targeting specific regions of the brain, combined with drugs capable of modulating the inflammatory processes, will further fuel hopes of eradicating these debilitating neurodegenerative diseases.

1236,Manifestations and development of Wilson's disease in pediatric patients with the very rare atb7b mutation l708p. [],"OBJECTIVES: To characterize a cohort of 11 pediatric patients aged 3 to 13 years affected by Wilson's disease on the island of Gran Canaria. METHODS: Genetic, biochemical, and pathologic characteristics were analyzed along with their treatment response and clinical evolution for this patient population. RESULTS: Genetically, the group was fairly homogeneous, with a very high prevalence of the L708P mutation (four homozygotes and five heterozygotes). Although initially screened for asymptomatic hypertransaminemia, all patients presented some degree of liver damage that was never accompanied by any neurological manifestation. Liver damage was most severe in a compound heterozygote with a novel mutation, G1266W, affecting a motif in the ATP7B polypeptide that is highly conserved in similar proteins in metazoans. Ceruloplasmin and serum copper levels together with determination of hepatic copper content proved to be of great diagnostic value, while urinary copper measurements proved to be much less meaningful. All patients responded well to treatment with D-penicillamine, with no documented side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The patients in Gran Canaria represent overall one of the largest groups of WM patients with a high incidence of a single mutation, which allows us to define the early clinical signs and evolution of the disease in patients carrying the mutant ATP7B Carrying the L708P allele, and studying WD in a genetically homogeneous background.",,"Pena-Quintana, L.;Garcia-Luzardo, M.

Methods: 68 patients were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. The Personal Health Questionnaire-9 Depression Scale was used to assess depression. The questionnaire Short Form-36 Health Survey was used to survey the health-related quality of life. Results: The Personal Health Questionnaire-9 showed that 21% (14/68) of patients were at risk for major depressive disorder (scores > 10) and 35% (24/68) at risk for minor depression (scores 5-9). had ).

1239,The role of zinc in liver cirrhosis,"Zinc is an essential trace element that plays a fundamental role in cell metabolism. It works primarily by binding to a wide range of proteins, thereby affecting a wide range of biological processes including cell division, growth and differentiation. Zinc is crucial for a variety of structural proteins, enzymatic processes and transcription factors. Zinc deficiency can result in a spectrum of clinical manifestations such as: B. loss of appetite, loss of body hair, altered taste and smell, testicular atrophy, cerebral and immunological dysfunction and decreased capacity for excreting drugs. These are common symptoms in patients with chronic liver disease, especially cirrhosis. The liver is the main organ for zinc metabolism, which can be affected by liver disease. On the other hand, zinc deficiency can alter hepatocyte functions and also immune responses in inflammatory liver diseases. Liver cirrhosis represents the most advanced stage of chronic liver disease and is the most common consequence of chronic liver damage. It is associated with energy malnutrition, numerous metabolic disorders such as hypoalbuminemia, imbalance between branched-chain amino acids and aromatic amino acids, and decreased serum zinc concentrations. All of these processes can affect the clinical outcome of patients, such as B. ascites, hepatic encephalopathy and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this review we summarize the emerging evidence on the central role of zinc in the pathogenesis of liver cirrhosis. Copyright © 2016, Fundacion Clinica Medica Sur.

WD can be successfully treated with chelators or zinc salts to correct the abnormal copper metabolism that normally improves both liver function and neurological deficits; However, neurological deficits can take years to improve. Patients may initially present with severe neurological deficits that interfere with activities of daily living. Consequently, therapy to alleviate the neurological symptoms is required. Treatment decisions are often based on experience with other disorders with symptoms clinically similar to WM. Areas covered: There are no guidelines for the management of neurological symptoms other than general recommendations for anti-copper therapy and liver transplantation in patients with WM. This review article describes the most common neurological symptoms and their treatment options, mainly based on case reports. Expert Opinion: There is no strong evidence to treat neurological disorders in patients with WM. Several case studies indicate that medications used to treat movement disorders such as tremor, parkinsonism, or dystonia may also relieve these symptoms in patients with WM. In the case of severe, disabling neurological symptoms, treatment options for the symptoms should always be discussed with the patient.

1246,Metals and Neurodegeneration,"Metals play important roles in the human body by maintaining cellular structure and regulating gene expression, neurotransmission, and the antioxidant response, to name a few. However, excessive accumulation of metals in the nervous system can be toxic, cause oxidative stress, disrupt mitochondrial function, and impair the activity of numerous enzymes. Damage caused by metal accumulation can result in permanent injury, including serious neurological disorders. Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown a strong correlation between exposure to aberrant metals and a range of neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Guillain-Barre Disease, Gulf War Syndrome, Huntington's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis , Parkinson's disease, and Wilson's disease. Here we provide a brief review of the literature on the role of metals in neurodegeneration. Copyright © 2016 Chen P et al.",,"Chen, P.;Miah, M.

1247,Wilson's disease in Thai children between 2000 and 2012 at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital,"Objective: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation. Clinical presentations are extraordinarily diverse, and currently no single diagnostic test can confirm WM with high accuracy. A complete understanding of the presentations and improved diagnostic methods are important for disease management. The authors aimed to investigate the disease characteristics, management, and treatment outcomes of WM in children, particularly when genetic analysis and hepatic copper measurements were limited. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected from 21 WD children treated at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between 2000 and 2012. Inclusion criteria followed the WD scoring system, which systematically excludes other liver diseases. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 13.5 +/- 3.36 years in 19 symptomatic patients and two asymptomatic individuals diagnosed by family screening. Presentations varied, jaundice (52%), ascites (52%), edema (52%), Coombs negative hemolytic anemia (14%), neurologic abnormalities (33%), renal involvement (19%), and fulminant hepatic failure (5%) . Based on the key parameters in the WD scoring system, 14 patients (66%) had Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings. Seventeen (89%) had low serum ceruloplasmin and 20 (95%) had increased urinary copper excretion. These positive results resulted in the WD scoring system accurately diagnosing 66% of patients. Chelation therapy was the first line of therapy for all patients except one patient who was undergoing liver transplantation. After the therapy, the liver function test normalized in all patients. However, the neurological symptoms did not improve with combined drug therapy with chelating agents and neuropsychiatric agents. Conclusion: WD in children mainly affected the liver. WD was suspected in seven patients (34%), requiring further investigation. Therefore, long-term follow-up of patients suspected of having WM is the appropriate method for diagnosis and treatment in limited diagnostic testing. We suggest continuing treatment and using clinical response to treatment as a criterion for confirming the diagnosis of WM. Copyright © 2016, Medical Association of Thailand.

1248,Chemical and physical characterization of thermal aggregation of model proteins modulated by zinc(II) and copper(II) ions,"BACKGROUND: Metal ions are involved in protein aggregation processes of various neurodegenerative pathologies, where protein deposition occurs, and in the field of biotechnology such as food technology, where many processes in food production are based on thermal treatments. AIM: The influence of Cu<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions on the thermal aggregation process of bovine beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), two proteins models, was studied with the aim to describe the role of these ions in protein aggregation kinetics and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. METHODS: Protein structural changes were monitored by Raman spectroscopy, while aggregate growth was followed by dynamic light scattering measurements. RESULTS: Both metal ions are able to promote BLG aggregation, while only Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions have a promoting effect on thermal aggregation of BSA. The reason for this different behavior is that the aggregation evolution of BLG is mainly influenced by charge redistribution, while that of BSA is influenced by metal-dependent metal coordination bonding. CONCLUSIONS: Raman spectroscopy combined with dynamic light scattering experiments was very useful in identifying the role played by Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the aggregation pathways of BLG and play BSA . The results demonstrate the role of histidine residues in both charge redistribution and the two modes of metal binding that occur in BLG- and BSA-containing systems, respectively.

1249,Elastosis perforans serpiginosa and Wilson's disease: a rare but predictable consequence of long-term therapy with D-penicillamine. [Portuguese],"Elastosis perfurans serpiginosa is a rare perforating dermatosis that occurs mainly in adolescents and young adults and is characterized by the transepidermal elimination of abnormal elastic fibers. The only drug known to be able to induce elastosis perfurans serpiginosa is D-penicillamine. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with keratotic papules arranged in a ring-shaped pattern with a central glare and centrifugal growth, located in the anterior part of the neck. The patient was chronically treated with D-penicillamine for Wilson's disease. Lesion biopsy showed transepidermal elimination of thickened, eosinophilic, branched, sawtooth-like elastic fibers. The clinical and pathologic findings were consistent with serpiginous perfuration elastosis secondary to D-penicillamine. It is estimated that elastosis perfurans serpiginosa occurs in 1% of patients treated with D-penicillamine. By directly or indirectly blocking the desmosin crosslinks between elastin molecules, D-penicillamine leads to the synthesis of abnormal dermal and extracutaneous elastic fibers. Elastosis perfurans serpiginosa may be the first manifestation of a multisystemic degenerative process of elastic connective tissue. Copyright © Ordem dos Medicos 2016.",,"Pinho, A.;Cardoso, J.

1254,High-precision isotopic analysis of essential mineral elements in biomedicine: Natural variations in isotopic ratios as potential diagnostic and/or prognostic markers,"High-precision isotopic analysis of essential mineral elements, mainly Ca, Cu, Fe and Zn, provides relevant biomedical information. For this application, multi-collector ICP mass spectrometry is the preferred technique. Variations in the isotopic signature of these elements are determined by changes in their uptake, metabolism and/or excretion. Therefore, diseases that affect mineral metal metabolism, such as hemochromatosis, cancer, liver cirrhosis, and Wilson's disease, affect the isotopic composition of these elements in some body compartments. This review discusses how variations in the natural isotopic ratio in biofluids can potentially be used as alternative approaches to diagnose diseases that can otherwise only be detected at a later stage or via a more invasive method and/or for prognostic purposes. This discussion also includes an assessment of isotopic variability in biofluids for apparently healthy individuals and in biofluids, soft tissues and bones from experimentally controlled animals. Physiological factors and lifestyle factors were also taken into account.

1255,Serum copper and zinc in a representative sample of the Bulgarian population,"Copper (Cu) and Zinc (Zn) are essential to life. The Cu and Zn content in the body depends on various factors: age, gender and diet, type of drinking water, geographical location and genetic predisposition. The copper status becomes even more relevant not only in rare genetic diseases such as Wilson's disease, but also in diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, impaired glucose tolerance and neurodegenerative and tumor diseases. The aim of the study was to examine the distribution of Cu and Zn in the serum in a representative group of the Bulgarian population and to describe factors influencing the metal content. It also aimed to describe the relationship between serum copper levels and the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Bulgarians. Serum Cu and Zn were measured in 379 individuals (172 males and 207 females) from 5 different regions of Bulgaria by flame atomic absorption using AAnalyst 400, Perkin Elmer. Statistical analyzes were performed by SPSS, 19th median and inert quartile range (IQR) for Cu in blood was 15.89 (13.87-7.89) mumol/L and for Zn 13.00 (11.7-14.68 ) mumol/L in the studied group. Higher Cu levels were found in women than in men (p < 0.001). A decrease in Zn with age was noted (p > 0.05). A significant difference (p<0.05) in serum Cu was found between young people (<30 years old) and adults over 61 years of age. With respect to residence, a statistically significant difference was observed for Cu and Zn (p<0.05). A difference without significance was measured between serum lipids and serum Cu (p = 0.541) and Zn (p = 0.741).",,"Ivanova, I.;Atanasova, B.;Kostadinova, A.;Bocheva, Y.;Tzatchev, K.",2016,2022-10-01 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/amb-2016-0013,0,0,
1256,A case of Wilson's disease presenting as chronic liver disease,"Wilson's disease is one of the most common inherited liver diseases with a worldwide incidence of 10-30 million cases. The increased frequency in certain countries is due to high rates of consanguinity, and the fulminant presentation of the disease is more common in women than men. It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, with consequent impairment of biliary copper excretion. Subsequent accumulation of copper, first in the liver but later in the brain and other tissues, leads to clinical manifestations that may include hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmic, and other disorders. Genetic testing is impractical due to the large number of mutations identified, so an accurate diagnosis depends on judicious use of laboratory and other diagnostic tests. Lifelong palliative treatment with a different combination of drugs or, if necessary, liver transplantation can successfully mitigate or prevent the progressive deterioration of the disease, otherwise death would inevitably ensue. Since effective treatment is available for this disease, early and correct diagnosis is very important.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency,"Introduction Hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are the major metabolic liver diseases. Hemochromatosis Patients with hemochromatosis develop progressive iron overload leading to cirrhosis of the liver. His diagnosis is based on confirmation of iron overload and examination of mutations in the HFE gene. Phlebotomy is the treatment of choice for hemochromatosis; it avoids progression to cirrhosis. Wilson's disease Wilson's disease is based on mutations in ATP7B. Its main feature is copper overload, which causes liver toxicity (fulminant liver failure or cirrhosis) and neurotoxicity. Drugs used to treat Wilson's disease are D-penicillamine, trientine, and zinc. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop liver disease (neonatal cholestatic hepatitis and/or choroidal liver disease) and emphysema as a result of retention in the liver and reduction in serum levels of the enzyme.

Based on the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring and laboratory parameters of copper metabolism, she was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. The patient's electrocardiography revealed incidental second-degree Mobitz type 1 atrioventricular block, which explains her episodes of light-headedness. She was started on penicillamine and trihexyphenidyl. The heart block improved spontaneously. Autonomic cardiac function tests, including blood pressure response to standing and heart rate response to standing, were observed to be normal.

1262,Diagnosis and treatment of tremor,"Purpose of Review: Tremor, a rhythmic vibration of a body part, is one of the most common involuntary movements. Rhythmic oscillations can manifest themselves in a number of ways; consequently, tremor surrounds a rich clinical phenomenology. Because of this, diagnosing tremor disorders can be particularly challenging. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with a straightforward approach to diagnosing and treating patients with tremor. Recent Findings: The scientific understanding of the pathophysiological basis of tremor disorders has increased significantly in recent years through the use of a wide range of imaging modalities and rigorous, controlled postmortem studies. The basal ganglia and cerebellum are structures that seem to play a prominent role. Summary: The diagnosis of tremor disorders is challenging. The tremor approach involves a medical history and a neurological examination that focuses on the nuances of the tremor phenomenology, of which there are many. Evaluation should begin with a history of tremors and a focused neurological examination. The study should address the many subtleties of tremor phenomenology. The history and examination serve, among other things, to determine whether the main form of the tremor is an action tremor (ie postural, movement or intention tremor) or a rest tremor. The clinician should then formulate two groups of differential diagnoses: disorders in which action tremor is the predominant tremor versus those in which rest tremor is the predominant tremor. The most common of the former type include essential tremor, increased physiological tremor, drug-induced tremor, dystonic tremor, orthostatic tremor, and cerebellar tremor. Next to drug-induced resting tremor, Parkinson's disease is the most common form of resting tremor. This article describes the clinical features of each of these and other tremor disorders. © Copyright 2016 American Academy of Neurology.",,"Louis, E.

1264,Wilson's Disease: Update Bin. [Deutsch],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease in which ATP7B mutations lead to a disturbance in copper metabolism. The result is reduced copper excretion in the bile and excessive copper deposition in the liver and brain. Patients with WM typically present with hepatic symptoms in late childhood or adolescence, or as young adults with extrapyramidal or psychiatric symptoms. However, it is important to consider WM in patients with movement disorders after the age of 40, especially in combination with (sub)clinical liver dysfunction. Left untreated, WD leads to severe disability or death. When diagnosed early, effective treatment is available that prevents the disease from progressing and reverses some of the symptoms. Treatment with chelating agents induces renal excretion of copper, and zinc salts inhibit duodenal copper absorption. A liver transplant makes sense in severe hepatic cases and can also be considered in severe neurological courses that cannot be treated successfully in any other way.

1265,Elemental bioimaging and speciation analysis to study Wilson's disease using muxRF and XANES,"liver biopsy sample from a patient with Wilson's disease (WD) was analyzed by micro X-ray fluorescence (muXRF) spectroscopy to determine the elemental distribution. First, benchtop muXRF was used for a rough scan of the sample under laboratory conditions. The resulting copper and iron distribution maps enabled the determination of a region of interest (ROI) for further analysis. To obtain more detailed elementary information, this ROI was analyzed by synchrotron radiation (SR)-based muXRF with a beam size of 4 µm, which offers cellular-level resolution. Distribution maps of additional elements to copper and iron such as zinc and manganese were created due to higher sensitivity of SR-muXRF. In addition, X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) was performed to identify the oxidation states of copper in WD. This speciation analysis revealed a mixture of copper(i) and copper(ii) within WD liver tissue. Copyright © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Hachmoller, O.;Buzanich, A.

1266,Zinc monotherapy in young children with asymptomatic Wilson's disease: multicenter study in Japan,"Background and Aims: The AASLD and EASL guidelines recommend zinc monotherapy as treatment for asymptomatic patients with Wilson's disease (WD). We have previously reported that a reasonable goal in treating young children with asymptomatic WD with zinc is to maintain 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the first 1-2 years (Mizuochi , et al.JPGN 2011;53:365). Here we aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for young children under 10 years of age with asymptomatic WM in Japanese pediatric centers and to establish appropriate benchmarks for maintenance therapy. METHODS: We conducted a retro- and prospective study to examine 21 children (mean age 6 years, range 1-9) who met the diagnostic criteria for WM and who had pre-symptom onset at 10 participating pediatric centers in Japan exclusively with treated with zinc acetate. No additional WD sequelae such as jaundice, hepatomegaly, or neurological abnormalities were noted. We monitored serum AST and ALT, non-ceruloplasmin serum copper, and 24-hour urinary copper for 1–7 years after initiation of zinc monotherapy. Additional monitoring included white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, gamma-glutamyltransferase, total bilirubin, albumin, iron, amylase, lipase, and prothrombin time, and 24-hour urinary zinc excretion. We performed abdominal ultrasound and assessed clinical WM manifestations, drug compliance, and zinc side effects. The prescribed zinc acetate dose for patients <= 5 years was 25 mg twice daily; for these children aged 6 years and older, the dose was 25 mg three times a day. We increased the zinc dose if patients had AST/ALT > 50-70 U/L and decreased it if they had side effects of zinc such as iron deficiency anemia or pancytopenia. Results: At the time of diagnosis, AST/ALT and 24-hour urinary copper were 148+/-118/234+/-151 U/L and 124+/-54 cups/day (5.8+/-2, 9 cups/kg/day), respectively. All patients continued to take zinc with no evidence of zinc toxicity. None of our 21 patients became clinically symptomatic. AST/ALT decreased significantly to 54+/-30/77+/-49 U/L (P<0.001) 1 month after the start of treatment and was mostly maintained below 50 U/L for 1-7 years (AST/ALT: 33+/-7/38+/-17 and 29+/-5/34+/-6 U/l 1 or 7 years after the start of treatment). 24-hour urinary copper decreased significantly to 49 +/- 21 cups/day (2.2 +/- 1.1 cups/kg/day; P<0.001) 6 months after the start of treatment and was mostly below 75 cups /day maintained between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the remainder of the study (2.2 +/- 0.6 and 1.5 +/- 0.2 cups/kg/day 1 and 7 years after the start of the Treatment). Conclusions: Long-term zinc monotherapy for young children with asymptomatic WM has been shown to be highly effective and safe. A reasonable goal in treating young children with asymptomatic WD with zinc appears to be to keep both AST/ALT below 50 U/L and 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day (and below 75 cups/day).",,"Mizuochi, T.;Eda, K.;Takaki, Y.;Iwama, I.;Araki, M.;Inui, A.;Hara, S.;Kumagai, H.;Hagiwara, S.

1267,Serum zinc discriminates indefinitely: Acute liver failure due to Wilson's disease: Acute liver failure,"Aims and study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Combined clinical and laboratory findings are required for early diagnosis. There is a proposed hypothesis that low serum zinc (Zn) is related to the phenotypic severity of WD. Indeed, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a Zn-containing metalloenzyme that reflects actual Zn deficiency, is relatively low in WM patients, supporting this notion. However, few studies underscore the role of these biomarkers in the pathogenesis and severity of WD. Our study aimed to monitor levels of serum Zn, ALP, and other baseline laboratory results in acute liver failure (ALF) of unexplained cause and WD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of children with MB (n=43) and unexplained ALF (n=9) at King's College Hospital between 2005 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Disease-causing mutations were identified in all WD children. WD is divided into WD-non-ALF (n=28) and WD-ALF (n=15). Serum Zn, copper, ceruloplasmin (CP) and liver function test values were collected. Free serum copper and corrected Zn formula were calculated as follows; Free copper (mu mol/l) Total copper (mu mol/l) Bound copper (mu mol/l) (bound copper 0.0472 x ceruloplasmin (mg/l)) and corrected Zn patient 0.25 x Zn normal + (( albumin normal/ albumin patient) x (Zn patient (0.25x Zn normal)) Results: Our study shows significantly lower serum Zn, corrected Zn and ALP levels in WD-ALF compared to WD non- ALF and ALF of undetermined cause (Table 1) Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that the dramatic deviation of serum Zn in WD-ALF can distinguish WD-ALF from undetermined ALF.",,"Sintusek, P.;Dhawan, A.",2016,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000503536.79797.66,0,0,
1268,Treatment modality and possible outcome of Wilson's disease in Taiwan: A population-based longitudinal study,"Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology, drug preference and long-term outcome of Wilson's disease in Taiwan. Methods: Data were extracted from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which stores detailed clinical records from all insurers in Taiwan. The database used in this study is a randomized sample of two million out of 23 million beneficiaries in Taiwan's NHIRD in 2005. And the integrated medical records of these two million cases were collected from 2000 to 2011. Patients with Wilson's disease were identified as having International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 275.1 and the specific prescription drugs (including D-penicillamine, zinc, and trientine) in outpatient or inpatient records. Results: During the study period, 66 cases of Wilson's disease were identified. The male to female ratio was 1.75. The mean prevalence rate was 1.81 per 100,000 and the mean annual incidence rate was 0.22 per 100,000. The age-specific incidence rate peaked at ages 10–14 years, followed by 20–24 years and 25–29 years. Fifty-four of all subjects (81.8%) started treatment with D-penicillamine compared to zinc (12.1%) and trientine (6.1%). Of these 66 cases with Wilson's disease, 27 (40.9%) had liver cirrhosis and 3 (4.5%) underwent liver transplantation due to liver failure. Conclusions: D-penicillamine remains the drug most commonly prescribed to patients with Wilson's disease, followed by zinc monotherapy. Although chronic liver damage cannot be avoided, a favorable long-term outcome is evident in this population-based study. Liver failure or mortality was rarely found.",,"Tai, C. S.;Ni, Y.

1269,A Japanese child with idiopathic copper toxicosis,"We observed a Japanese child with idiopathic copper toxicosis (ICT) who was diagnosed with histological abnormalities of the liver. Case: A seven-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital with severe jaundice. He suffered from itching and growth retardation since he was 3 years old. His physical findings were jaundice, angioma spider on his cheeks, hepatospolenomegaly (liver palpable 6 cm at right rib margin, spleen palpable 5 cm at left rib margin), and scraping with bleeding in the skin. His lab results were WBC 6,420/microL, hemoglobin 10.3 g/dL, platelets 174,000/microL, total bilirubin 13.5 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 10.6 mg/dL, AST 1,477 U/L, ALT 457 U/L, LDH 393 U/L, GGT 162 U/L, Alb 2.9 g/dL, UA 2.4 mg/dL, PT 37.7%, APTT 49.4 s and haptoglobin 9 mg/dL. Its copper-associated profiles were serum Cu 215 micro-g/dL, ceruloplasmin 48.6 mg/dL, and 24-hour urine Cu 472.8 micro-g/d. Clinical course: He was diagnosed with Wilson's disease (WD) with normal serum ceruloplasmin levels and no abnormality of the ATP7B gene. He was treated with trientine hydrochloride in addition to zinc acetate for 30 days. His 24-hour urine Cu levels rose to >2,500 micrograms/day while his condition worsened. His new Wilson Index reached 17. He was transferred to the transplant center and underwent a cadaveric liver transplant. Histology of the explanted liver: The liver surface and divided face showed multiple nodular formations. The lobular architecture was disrupted by severe fibrosis. Inflammation was minimal. Mallory body-like materials were clearly found in hepatocytes. A copper content in the explanted liver was 1482.3 micrograms/g dry weight. Both orcein and rhodanine stains stained strongly in hepatocytes. Discussion and Conclusion: ICT is one of the copper metabolism disorders that is less well known than Wilson's disease. The pathogenesis of ICT is still unknown, but the clinical features of ICT are similar to those of hepatic Wilson's disease. Cases of Wilson disease with normal or high serum ceruloplasmin levels should consider ICT. Liver histology is helpful to diagnose ICT.",,"Inui, A.;Umetsu, S.;Sogo, T.;Komatsu, H.;Fukuda, A.;Kasahara, M.;Matsuuta, A.;Fujisawa, T.",2016,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000503536.79797.66,0,0,
1270,Analysis of renal dysfunction in 102 children with Wilson's disease,"a. Aims Since the various manifestations of renal dysfunction occur in different phases of Wilson's disease (WD), misdiagnosis is not uncommon. We conducted this study to determine the clinical features of renal dysfunction in children with WM. b. Methods We enrolled 102 children with MV treated in our department from January 1995 to December 2012. Renal dysfunction includes any of the following: abnormal urinalysis (proteinuria 1/4 hematuria, glucosuria, hypercalcinuria, or increase in urinary NAG; abnormal renal function (BUN >=7.14 mmol/L, Scr>=176.8 mol/L), abnormal renal ultrasound or renal biopsy, ruling out renal involvement caused by other factors c.Results Demographics: There are 58 with abnormal urinalysis in 102 WM patients. Excluded 14 with only single and 10 with D-penicillamine treatment, the remaining 34 patients: 14 Boys and 20 girls hematuria, 2 cases were nephrotic proteinuria, 1 case was renal tubular acidosis, urinary NAG increased in 12, urinary RBC phase morphology was noted in 15, 3 glomerular hematuria and 12 non-glomerular hematuria relieved. Creatinine clearance rate decreased in 2 patients Ultrasound showed asystematic kidney damage in 5 of 27 patients Kidney biopsy showed IgA deposition in the mesangial region in 2. Initial renal dysfunction: 9 had triggered symptoms of renal dysfunction, 4 of them had severe hematuria, 1 with edema, hematuria and proteinuria, 1 with purpura, hematuria and proteinuria, 1 with frequent and urgent urination, 2 with edema and severe proteinuria. Prognosis: In all patients, renal dysfunction improved or disappeared after treatment. i.e. Conclusions Renal dysfunction in WD, including injury after D-penicillamine treatment, is not uncommon.

1271,"An Ongoing, Multicenter, Open-Label, Phase 2 Trial of WTX101 in Patients With Wilson's Disease - Early Observations","Aim: The aim of this ongoing study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease. Background: WTX101 (bischolintetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational decopper agent being developed for the treatment of Wilson's disease. The purpose of this ongoing study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease. METHODS: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson's disease who were treatment-naïve or treated with chelation or zinc therapy for <=28 days received 30 or 60 mg of WTX101 QD during the initiation period. Dosing was individualized after 6 weeks, guided by laboratory and clinical criteria. Periodic assessments included safety, liver disease status including synthetic function and modified Nazer score, and change from baseline in free copper. and neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: The first six patients (age 18-53 years; 2 males) were followed in the study for 8 to 36 weeks. The modified Nazer score ranged from 1-5 and 5/6 had neurological manifestations at baseline. Reversibly elevated liver function tests associated with dose escalations per protocol were observed in the first 2 patents. After reducing the initial dose from 30 mg BID (total 60 mg/day) to 30 mg QD and escalating the dose to a maximum daily dose of 60 mg, WTX101 was well tolerated with no SAEs and few AEs. Liver status improved or remained stable. Elevated baseline NCC levels in plasma, adjusted for molybdenum, normalized within 3 months on average. UWDRS scores improved in all patients with neurological manifestations. At 3 months, the neurological exam score (Part III) was reduced from approximately 30 to <10, with continuous improvement thereafter. Daily activity status (Part II) showed a similar improvement. Conclusions: WTX101 appears to be safe and well-tolerated in patients with Wilson's disease. With the improvement in clinical (hepatic and neurological) and laboratory evaluations, including copper control in these first patients, further clinical evaluation is warranted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of WTX101.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Weiss, K.

1272,Iron accumulation in a patient with Wilson's disease: longitudinal 7T MRI and transcranial ultrasonography study,"Aim: To study longitudinal changes in clinical symptoms, 7-T MRI, and transcranial ultrasonography (TCS) during chelation treatment in a patient with Wilson's disease (WD). Background: Pathophysiological causes and predictive biomarkers of clinical deterioration in WM patients treated with anti-copper are unknown. One of the possible contributing factors may be iron accumulation in the brain. Our aim was to investigate longitudinal changes in T2* relaxation time and echogenicity of deep gray matter structures as a measure of iron content in a WM patient. METHODS: We studied a de novo WM patient at baseline and followed him regularly for 30 months with anti-copper treatment. Clinical severity was assessed using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). The 7T MRI imaging protocol included a 3D magnetization prepared fast gradient echo (MPRAGE, TE = 3 ms; TR = 2300 ms) and a 2D multi-echo gradient echo (GRE, 8 echoes 4.1-25.5 ms; TR = 1820 ms) for T2 * Parametric mapping. R2* values were measured in the globus pallidus (GP), putamen (Put), caudate nucleus (NC), and thalamus (Thal). TCS was performed and the echogenicity indices of the lens nucleus (NL) and NC were calculated using TCS digital image analysis software. Results: A 27-year-old man developed ataxia and action tremor in his hands and was diagnosed with WD (p.H1069Q homozygous mutation) three months later. At the start of the study there was pronounced bilateral NL hyperechogenicity; The R2* value at the primary care physician (130) was 1.3-fold compared to four age-matched controls (mean 99.9+/-(SD)9.8). After starting penicillamine treatment (increased to 900 mg), ataxia and tremor progressed and generalized dystonia appeared along with vertical gaze palsy. After switching to trientine (increased to 900 mg) and later to zinc (150 mg) + trientine (600 mg), his symptoms gradually improved and the UWDRS score fell from 104 to 56. The R2* value gradually increased, especially at Put (red arrows) and Thal (green arrows) indicates iron accumulation. This was associated with thalamic atrophy and cavitation on MP-RAGE MRI (green arrows). TCS showed no changes in NL and NC echogenicity during treatment. Conclusions: Our data suggest that increased brain iron concentration may already be present in de novo WM, while further iron deposition may be associated with degenerative changes during unsuccessful anticopper treatment. NL hyperechogenicity does not reflect R2* changes and can serve as a trait marker.

1273,Copper chelation efficacy of alginate/chitosan-based D-penicillamine nanoparticles in the rat model of non-Wilson's brain copper toxicosis,"Aim: To evaluate the copper (Cu) chelation efficacy of orally administered D-penicillamine-loaded nanoparticles compared to that of conventional D-penicillamine therapy for 90 days in the Wistar rat model of non-Wilson brain Cu toxicosis. Background: Oral D-penicillamine therapy fails to attenuate brain Cu overload and neurological manifestations in patients with Wilson's disease. Methods: Atomic absorption spectrophotometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, neurobehavioral and histopathological studies, and nanoparticle preparation/physicochemical characterization were performed. Results: D-penicillamine nanoparticles showed a mean size of 274.09 nm and less than 29.32% D-penicillamine release under in vitro conditions. Pharmacokinetic studies showed increased levels of dpenicillamine in the brain of the nanoparticle-based d-penicillamine administration group compared to the conventional dpenicillamine administration group. Conventional and nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy resulted in significantly improved neuromuscular coordination and memory along with a concomitant increase in urinary copper levels in the Wistar rat model of copper toxicosis. Conventional D-penicillamine therapy resulted in negative rhodanine staining of brain and liver sections, indicated by a 16.4% and 60.1% reduction in Cu content in brain and liver compared to untreated Cu-poisoned group was confirmed. However, liver and brain slices from the nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy group showed grade 1 Cu deposits and no Cu deposits, as indicated by a 47.2% and 32.8% reduction in liver and liver Cu levels, respectively brain compared to the untreated Cu-poisoned group. Conclusions: Our data provide the first in vivo evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of D-penicillamine nanoparticles in chelating more copper in the brain and alleviating neurological deficits, even at half the dose of conventional D-penicillamine therapy is administered.

1274,"Clinical profile of Wilson's disease at Yangon General Hospital, Myanmar","Aim: To evaluate the clinical, biochemical and imaging profile of patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Background: There has been no reported case series of WD in Myanmar. This study was a hospital-based study conducted at the Department of Neurology, Yangon General Hospital, Myanmar. Methods: Between 2010 and 2015, definitive WM was diagnosed in 17 patients and probable WM in 1 using the Leipzig criteria. Results: Of the 18 patients, 8 were male and 10 were female. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 20 years. Main symptoms were: abnormal gait in 17 of 18 (94.4%); Speech problems 17 (94.4%), parkinsonian symptoms 9 (50%), tremor 8 (44.4%), cerebellar symptoms and signs in 4 (22.2%), 14 patients (66.6%) had psychiatric symptoms . Five patients (27.7%) had dysphagia, 2 (11.1%) had seizures, and 1 (5.5%) had chorea. KF rings were positive in all patients. Serum ceruloplasmin levels were low in 17 patients (94.4%) and below normal in 1 patient. Only 3 patients (16.6%) had concurrent hepatic manifestations. Renal and hematological involvement was observed in 2 patients (11.1%). Three (16.6%) patients had a positive family history and one patient (5.5%) had consanguineous parents. Only one of the siblings of the affected patients was examined and found to have WM. CT (brain) was performed in 8 of 18 patients (44.4%) and all had bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity and one (5.5%) had subcortical involvement. MRI (brain) was performed in 12 of 18 patients (61.1%) and showed hyperintense signals in T2 mainly in the basal ganglia, thalami and midbrain. All patients were initially treated with penicillamine and zinc as maintenance therapy. One patient was 12 weeks pregnant at the time of diagnosis and penicillamine was being administered because trientine is unavailable. Her neurological symptoms improved significantly and she had a premature birth at 34 weeks. The infant was low birth weight with hypotension and died at one year of age. Only 7 of 18 patients (38.8%) came for regular follow-up and clinical improvements were observed, but the outcome of 11 patients was unknown. Conclusions: Limited access to diagnostic facilities and drug availability is a major obstacle to early diagnosis and adherence to long-term treatment, leading to devastating outcomes of the disease in patients in this study.",,"Aye, S.

1275,Clinical and imaging worsening of a mild case of Wilson's disease after chelation therapy,"Aim: To present a case of mild Wilson's disease with neuropsychiatric features that showed clinical and imaging deterioration five months after trientine chelation. Background: Wilson's disease is a rare, autosomal recessively inherited copper metabolism disorder. Once the diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made in our patient, the proper chelation of ALD was initiated by AL and the available medication trientine was selected. Trientine is a chelating agent indicated as initial therapy with fewer side effects than penicillamine. METHODS: Dosing was initially 300 mg daily for the first three months and then 600 mg daily in two divided doses for the next two months. once the dose was increased, neurological deterioration has been reported. According to the neurological examination, postural and wing tremors as well as gait difficulties with dystonic spasms, slight loss of sensitivity and atactic speech were mentioned. The brain MRI was deteriorated compared to the previous one obtained before treatment. A distinctive face of the giant panda sign has been described along with lesions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and midbrain. Results: Treatment was discontinued but before urinary copper excretion was assessed. After two weeks without treatment, the patient's clinical condition improved and urinary copper excretion was reassessed, as were serum copper, both below normal values. Conclusions: In conclusion, in this case, the neurological and brain MRI deterioration was due to excessive copper removal. Therefore, traditional chelating agents may not be safe when used in mild forms of Wilson's disease, and prophylactic therapy such as zinc may be more effective and preferable.",,"Kleoniki, C.;Spiridon, K.;Cristos, T.;Aristidis, K.",2016,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.26688,0,0,
1276,A case of Wilson's disease with depression as the first symptom,"Wilson's disease is a chronic condition resulting from abnormal accumulation of copper in various organs, usually accompanied by disorders of copper metabolism due to a specific genetic abnormality. Many neurological symptoms such as slurred speech, dysarthria, dystonia, parkinsonian symptoms, chorea and ataxia are commonly recognized as the onset symptoms and syndromes of Wilson's disease. But dementia or frontal lobe syndrome can also be observed in Wilson's disease. Here we report a case of a 17-year-old man with executive dysfunction and apathy with depressed mood as the initial symptom of Wilson's disease. A 17-year-old male presented to our emergency department with apathy that had appeared approximately 3 days previously. His vital signs and laboratory findings were nonspecific. Executive dysfunction was suspected at initial neurological examination. During approximately 3 hours of observation in the hospital, he presented a slight bilateral action-posture tremor and suspicious slurred speech was noted. Bilaterally symmetrically high signal intensities in the putamen and caudate nucleus in T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. In his previous dietary history, he had been eating excessive amounts of pork liver and shellfish, which were high in copper, for months. The copper concentration in the urine was increased (2123.2 μg/24 h) and the serum ceruloplasmin level was decreased (< 4 mg/dL). When Wilson's disease was diagnosed, he was treated with zinc and trientine. Wilson's disease can lead to neuropsychiatric symptoms including subcortical dementia and frontal lobe syndrome. In general, liver dysfunction or motor symptoms are often detected early in the disease. But at a young age, an acute onset of cognitive impairment associated with Wilson's disease should be considered, and close monitoring for neurological symptoms is required.",,"Chang, H.;Park, H.;Cheong, J.",2016,August,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jnc.13692,0,0,
1277,Wilson's disease associated with immotile cilia syndrome: A case report,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease (WD) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) are rare autosomal recessive diseases, both with an incidence <1:15000. We present a unique case of WD associated with PCD. Methods: Case report Results: A 24-year-old woman was admitted with a history of headache, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss. Liver hardness, hypotonia, hypoeducible deep tendon reflexes, mild ataxia, and Kayser-Fleischer rings were noted. Laboratory tests revealed elevated liver function tests. Patient history showed 5 hospitalizations for bronchopneumonia before age 12. Each time laboratory tests showed increased transaminasemia with normal ceruloplasminemia. Ultrasound and liver biopsy documented moderate steatosis, which at the time was interpreted as a result of PCD-induced cholestasis. Phase contrast and electron microscopy showed immobility of the cilia without dynein in the axoneme: she was diagnosed with PCD. On admission, Fibroscan showed hepatic fibrosis. The brain MRI was unremarkable. Normal ceruloplasminemia, increased cupuria (2260 mg/24 h, normal < 70), fibrosis with high hepatic copper deposition (349 mg/g; normal < 9.9) were found. DNAI1, DNAH5 and DNAH11 genes were normal, while composite heterozygosity was found for 2304-2305insC and R1041W mutations in the ATP7B gene, which WD confirmed. The patient was started on penicillamine, with the benefit: 8 years later she is asymptomatic. Conclusion: Coexistence of WD and PCD has never been reported. Loci adjacent to ATP7B may contain dynein-encoding sequences affected by mutations in nearby genes. Early diagnosis can save lives. In this case, liver dysfunction was grossly reversed with decoppering agents. In addition, the reduction of ceruloplasmin, which is an acute phase reactant, was impeded by recurrent bronchopneumonia due to PCD. Being dogmatic about ceruloplasmin levels can distract from proper diagnosis and treatment.",,"Romoli, M.;Tambasco, N.;Prontera, P.;Nardi, E.;Clerici, C.;Calabresi, P.",2016,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.13094,0,0,
1278,First epidemiological study on Wilson's disease in France,"Background and Aims: In the literature, the estimated prevalence of Wilson's disease (WD) varies between 1/30,000 and 1/100,000. In France, with a population of 64 million, one would expect between 640 and 2100 cases of WD. The aim of this study is to estimate the national prevalence of WM based on data from the French National Health Insurance Information System (SNIIRAM) and to analyze epidemiological data by age, sex and treatments. Methods: This study covered all beneficiaries covered by the general health insurance scheme, which corresponds to 90% of the French population. WM patients were classified based on the presence of a long-term condition qualifying for 100% reimbursement (affection longue duree (ALD)) with code E83.0 (copper metabolism disorder) or with at least one hospitalization between 2011 and 2013 with the same code has identified . Results: 906 WM patients were identified, corresponding to a prevalence of 1.5/100,000. However, it is certainly underestimated, since patients who have been stabilized for many years are not registered as ALD. 43.2% were under 40 years old. Almost 40% of the patients were treated with D-penicillamine and 14.3% with zinc acetate, 5.6% received neuroleptics, 15% antidepressants. 5.3% had a liver transplant. Triethylenetetramine, supplied as compassion, does not appear in the base. A comparison of these data with the 500 patients followed at the National Reference Center for WD is presented.

1279,The incidence of copper deficiency due to overtreatment in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background and Objectives: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited copper excess disorder. Lifelong decopper therapy is required, but copper deficiency can result and manifest as myelopathy and hematological abnormalities. The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of copper deficiency as a treatment complication in a group of WM patients. Methods: We consecutively studied patients who were routinely followed up between April 2012 and April 2014. Free serum copper concentration, full blood count and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were determined to assess spinal impairment. A careful neurological examination was performed for the presence of clinical signs of myelopathy or neuropathy. Apparent copper deficiency was defined as the co-existence of low unbound ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) copper (< 5 µg/dl), blood count abnormalities, or/and myelopathy detected on SEPs and/or spinal MRI. Results: 64 patients with WD were included (39% hepatic, 51% neurological, and 10% presymptomatic features). The calculated NCC was < 5 mg/dl (normal range 10-15 mg/dl) in 14 (21%) patients. SEP conduction times were normal in 80% of these patients. Copper deficiency was diagnosed in three cases treated with zinc sulfate (two developed myelopathies with haematological signs, one leukopenia). Only one had clinical signs of myelopathy. Conclusion: Apparent copper deficiency is a rare (4.6%) side effect of long-term treatment of WM. Even rarer are neurological signs of copper deficiency. However, low NCC without other clinical signs is common (17%). Regular monitoring of copper metabolism parameters is essential to avoid treatment complications.",,"Dziezyc, K.;Sobanska, A.;Litwin, T.;Rakowicz, M.;Czlonkowska, A.",2016,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.13092,0,0,

The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in WM patients. Methods: Patients who were treatment-naïve or treated with chelation or zinc therapy for <= 28 days were started on WTX101 30 or 60 mg daily. Dosing was individualized after 6 weeks, guided by laboratory and clinical criteria. Assessments included safety, liver status, copper parameters and neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: The first 6 patients were followed in the study for 8 to 36 weeks. The modified baseline Nazer score ranged from 1 to 5, and 5/6 had neurological manifestations. In the first 2 patents, reversible elevated liver function tests were observed after dose escalations per protocol. After reducing the initial dose from 60 mg to 30 mg daily and escalating the dose to a maximum daily dose of 60 mg, WTX101 was well tolerated, with no SAEs and few AEs. Liver status improved or remained stable. Elevated free copper levels normalized within 3 months on average. UWDRS scores and daily activity improved in all neurological patients.

1281,Altered zinc ion levels and transporter expression suggest that high liver copper disrupts zinc metabolism in the Ap7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model of Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, which encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase. This mutation affects the regulation of copper metabolism primarily in the liver, but also in the kidneys and brain. Impaired function of the transporter ultimately leads to hyperaccumulation of copper in these organs with subsequent toxicity. While Wilson's disease is traditionally considered to be a copper-related disease, significantly elevated hepatic zinc levels (p<0.01) were observed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy in the ATP7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model used for the study Wilson disease. To determine the mechanisms of this observed hepatic hyperzincemia, relative transcription levels of hepatic specific zinc transporters belonging to the ZIP and ZnT families were monitored by using RT-qPCR. The results obtained showed differences in the mRNA levels of zinc transporters in the Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In particular, in 6-week-old animals, there was an increase in the relative amount of mRNA for the transporters ZIP9 and ZnT10. Differences in relative mRNA abundance between 6-week-old and 20-week-old animals were also observed, including reduced expression of ZIP7, ZIP9, ZnT4, ZnT6, and ZnT10 in 20-week-old animals. This suggests that there is indeed some association between transcriptional regulation of hepatic zinc transporters and abnormal zinc concentrations as a result of elevated hepatic copper levels.",,"Meacham, K.;Burkhead, J.",2016,,,0,0,
1282,Development of a copper-responsive MRI contrast agent,"Copper is the third most common trace metal in the body. Normally bound to important biomolecules, copper is an essential redox cofactor in several enzymatic reactions.

This MR sensor consists of a gadolinium-based DO3A contrast agent into which a copper-selective bis(benzoic acid)methyl)amine recognition motif (L<inf>1</inf>) has been introduced. The sensor shows a high selectivity for copper ions. Also shows high relaxivity (r<inf>1</inf>) with a 42% increase in relaxivity upon binding to 1 equivalent of Cu<sup>2+</sup>. Interestingly, only when fully bound to Cu<sup>2+</sup>, the sensor shows a 610% increase in r1 (~35 mM<sup>-1</sup>.s<sup>-1</sup> > ) in the presence of physiological levels of human serum albumin (HSA) as has only been reported for high-affinity zinc sensors (Figure 1).4 These results demonstrate that it is possible to develop a functional MRI contrast agent that targets copper at low Content is responsive and selective to concentrations, paving the way for potential translation to preclinical imaging.

1283,Subclinical neurological involvement does not develop if Wilson disease is treated early,"Aims and study: Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism in which metal deposits lead to dysfunction of various organs, mainly the liver and brain. Untreated, WD is fatal, but early treatment leads to a good prognosis, although the long-term neurological outcome is unclear. To address this issue, we assessed the neurological status of early-treated MM patients without overt nervous system impairment at least 10 years after treatment initiation using neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and imaging techniques. METHODS: Thirty-eight WM patients (18 females and 20 males, aged 24.47 +/- 7.50 years) who received early diagnosis in presymptomatic or mild or moderate stages of liver disease without neurological involvement and prompt treatment were included the Global Clinically Assessed Rating Scale. Presentation was hepatic in 36 patients (95%) while 2 patients (5%) were diagnosed at a pre-symptomatic stage. A neurophysiological study was performed to examine upper and lower limb central motor conduction time and motor cortex excitability using single-pulse and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Neuroimages were obtained using magnetic resonance scans of the brain. Cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral abilities were assessed using neuropsychological tests. TMS studies were also performed in a separate group of 15 WM patients with neurological symptoms (8 males and 7 females; mean age 28.2 +/- 12.1 years, mean duration of treatment 15.8 +/- 9.14 years ). Fifteen healthy subjects of the same age, education, and sex with no neurological, psychiatric, or other relevant clinical disorders (10 females and five males; mean age 26.7 +/- 9.1 years; school years 13.2 +/- 2 4) served as a control group for clinical, neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and neuropsychiatric evaluation. Results: Patients were treated with penicillamine (7 patients) or zinc salts (31 patients) with good adherence. They showed no neurological signs on clinical assessment or on any specific impairment scale, the mean score on the global assessment scale was 0.3 +/- 0.7. Magnetic resonance imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation studies, and neuropsychological/neuropsychiatric assessment ruled out subclinical involvement. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and treatment of WM can prevent the onset of neurological damage even at the subclinical level.",,"Ranucci, G.;Dubbioso, R.;Esposito, M.;Di Dato, F.;Leone, F.;Topa, A.;Quarantelli, M.;Matarazzo, M.;Santoro, L.;Manganelli, F.;Iorio, R.",2016,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000484500.48517.e7,0,1,
1284,Autoimmune hepatitis or Wilson's disease or both? Analysis of challenging cases,"Aims and study: A comorbidity of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and Wilson's disease (WD) can be considered but has never been demonstrated based on therapeutic response. There is a risk of misdiagnosis with standard diagnostics. We describe challenging patients in whom the definitive diagnosis could not be made with the primary diagnostic approach, and we question the coexistence of AIH and WD. METHODS: We identified 4 cases among 165 WD (Ferenci Score - FS) and 321 AIH patients in whom the primary diagnosis was changed or questioned. Results: 3 patients were diagnosed with elevated serum transaminase (TA) activity, one with acute liver failure. Case 1: diagnosed with AIH based on liver histology (steatohepatitis and fibrosis), ANA 1:640, IgG: 2824.5 mg/dl, with no WD testing performed. Prednisone and azathioprine (AZT) were not effective and 1 year later the diagnosis of WD was made based on the results of ceruloplasmin, urinary copper excretion, liver copper and molecular tests. Penicillamine was introduced, steroids and AZT were discontinued, resulting in normal liver values. Case 2: primarily does not meet the criteria of the WD: ceruloplasmin 16 mg/dl, normal urinary copper excretion. Liver histology (severe inflammation and fibrosis) prednisolone was started based on ANA 1:640 and ASMA 1:160. At 1 year, the child developed psychiatric and neurological symptoms, brain MRI showed abnormalities. Based on ceruloplasmin concentration, neurological symptoms and molecular testing (1 mutation), WD was diagnosed and zinc therapy started. The patient has since been diagnosed with Crohn's disease. The patient was treated with zinc, AZT and 5-ASA with good clinical and laboratory response. Case 3: had normal serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion. Based on histology (periportal inflammation), positive ANA 1:320 and ASMA 1:80, prednisolone was initiated. After 1 year, TA was still elevated. At the 2nd diagnostic approach, WM was diagnosed based on ceruloplasmin 14mg/dl and molecular test (FS: 7 points). Penicillamine was initiated and steroids discontinued, resulting in normal liver function tests. Case 4: WD diagnosed based on ceruloplasmin 16 mg/dl, urinary copper excretion 4901 µg/24 h, KF ring present and molecular test (2 mutations) (FS: 9 points). Penicillamine was started but 1 month later due to hipertransaminasemia and positive ANA (1:40), ASMA (1:40) steroids were added. After the next 4 weeks, trientine was started and penicillamine was discontinued because of neutropenia. Tapering off the steroids resulted in an increase in TA so the steroids were continued. A liver biopsy performed after normalization of coagulation showed steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Conclusion: WD can usually be distinguished from AIH, but in selected cases the differential diagnosis is difficult. WD should be retested in patients with poor steroid response. In a large cohort of WD and AIH patients, only one appears to have a comorbidity, but even in this case, AIH has not been fully confirmed.",,"Naorniakowska, M.;Wozniak, M.;Pronicki, M.;Kaminska, D.;Janczyk, W.;Dadalski, M.;Socha, P.",2016,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000484500.48517.e7,0,0,
1285,Predictors of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis measured with Fibroscan in children with Wilson's disease,"Aims and study: Wilson's disease in childhood can present with mild or extensive liver damage, as indicated by liver biopsy and liver function tests. Zinc or D-penicillamine (D-Pen) appear to stop the progression of liver damage, but zinc's effectiveness is often questioned. Because liver biopsy is not usually repeated as the disease progresses, only surrogate markers can be used to assess liver disease. Recently, non-invasive transient elastography - Fibroscan (Echosens, France) has been used in many chronic liver diseases to assess fibrosis and steatosis. Our aim was to assess liver disease progression and response to Fibroscan-assessed treatment in terms of the extent and type of pre-treatment liver damage, as assessed by liver histology and liver function tests. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed liver histology, liver copper content, and biochemical markers of 34 children with Wilson's disease aged 12.8 +/- 4.1 years at the time of diagnosis and compared them to liver stiffness (LSM) and steatosis (CAP) using Fibroscan after mean treatment duration of 9.7 years with zinc (n=21) or D-Pen (n=13). In addition, the LSM and CAP results of patients with Wilson's disease were compared to a control group of 20 healthy controls aged 11.8 +/- 5.3 years. Liver histology was semiquantitatively described, including micro- and macrovesicular steatosis (modified NAFLD scoring system from Kleiner et al.), portal and lobular inflammation, and cholestasis. Associations were tested using Spearman's R-test and differences between groups using Mann-Whitney's U-test. Results: The selected cohort of patients with Wilson disease had variable fibrosis (Grade 3-4 in 13 patients), lobular inflammation (Grade 2-3 in 2 patients), portal inflammation (Grade 2-3 in 3 patients), microvesicular ( grade 2-3 in 3 pts) and macrovesicular steatosis (grade 2-3 in 12 pts) and without cholestasis. There were no differences in pre-treatment parameters between children treated with Zn and D-Pen. Liver fibrosis (LSM) assessed by Fibroscan was mild but significantly higher in patients with Wilson's disease than in healthy controls [5 (4.1-6.1) vs. 4.2 (3.8-4.5) kPa] , and steatosis expressed by CAP was also increased [252 (218-292) vs. 182 (119-194) dB/m]; p<0.05. We found a significant relationship between hepatic steatosis assessed by Fibroscan (CAP) and hepatic macrovesicular steatosis at liver biopsy (r=0.68), while LSM was unrelated to hepatic fibrosis. LSM significantly correlated with baseline total bilirubin levels (r=0.4) but not with other liver function tests, ceruloplasmin, or liver copper content. We found no difference in Fibroscan results between the D-Pen or zinc treated groups [LSM 5.4 (4.3-6.1) vs. 4.5 (4.1-5.8) kPa; CAP 251 (208-266) versus 256 (235-307) dB/m]. Conclusion: Hepatic steatosis in children with Wilson's disease does not appear to be responsive to treatment, and the extent of steatosis over the course of the disease is closely related to pre-treatment values. The fibrosis at the beginning of therapy is influenced by the treatment and can change significantly over time. D-Pen and Zn therapy appear to be equally effective when tested with Fibroscan in children with mild liver damage.",,"Janczyk, W.;Pronicki, M.;Grajkowska, W.;Kaminska, D.;Kmiotek, J.;Naorniakowska, M.;Podlaska, M.;Socha, P.",2016,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000484500.48517.e7,0,1,
1286,"Serum zinc levels distinguish ""indeterminate"" acute liver failure from acute ""Wilson's disease"" liver failure","Aims and study: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Combined clinical and laboratory findings are required for early diagnosis. There is a proposed hypothesis that low serum zinc (Zn) is related to the phenotypic severity of WD. Indeed, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a Zn-containing metalloenzyme that reflects actual Zn deficiency, is relatively low in WM patients, supporting this notion. However, few studies underscore the role of these biomarkers in the pathogenesis and severity of WD. Our study aimed to monitor levels of serum Zn and other fundamental biomarkers in acute liver failure (ALF) of unknown cause and WD. METHODS: Retrospective data were reviewed from children with MV (n=30) and undetermined ALF (n=9) at King's College Hospital in 2005-2015. MV patients were diagnosed using King's protocol and 23 patients were confirmed by genetic analysis. WD is divided into WD-ALF and WD non-ALF. Serum Zn, copper, ceruloplasmin (CP) and liver function test values were collected. Results: Our study shows significantly lower serum Zn and corrected Zn levels in WD-ALF compared to WD non-ALF and ALF of undetermined cause. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that the dramatic variation in serum Zn in WD-ALF can distinguish WD-ALF from indeterminate ALF.

1287,Brain MRI and spectroscopy in the diagnosis of early neurologic involvement in Wilson's disease in children,"Aims and study: Wilson disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism characterized by accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, kidneys, and other tissues, resulting in hepatic and neuropsychiatric features. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) helps diagnose neurological Wilson disease. The literature on MR spectroscopy (MRS) in Wilson's disease is limited. The aim of this work was to evaluate the power of brain MRI and spectroscopy in the early detection of central nervous system abnormalities in children with Wilson's disease. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted between March 2011 and March 2014 after IRB approval at Gastroenterology Department “Paediatrics Department and Radiology Department” of Zagazig University Hospital, Zagazig, Egypt. Twenty-six patients with Wilson's disease and 26 healthy volunteers were included. Detailed anamnesis; A complete physical examination was performed, including regional anthropometric examination, complete abdominal examination, and neurological assessment. Routine laboratory tests included CBC, CRP, ESR, reticulocyte count, complete liver function tests, abdominal ultrasonography, immunoglobulin electrophoresis, and renal function tests. Specific investigations included serum ceruloplasmin levels, 24-hour urinary copper concentration, 24-hour urinary copper concentration with D-penicillamine challenge test, autoantibody panel (ANA, ASMA and ALKMA). Slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer ring and percutaneous liver biopsy for consistent liver histology (fatty changes or glycogenated nuclei). MRI and MRS were performed for all patients. Results: Eight patients showed conspicuous magnetic resonance imaging in the form of a bilateral signal increase in the basal ganglia in T1-weighted axial MRI images. Compared to controls, patients with WD had highly significant decreases in N-acetylaspartate, choline, and creatine levels (p<0.001) and significantly decreased N-acetylaspartate/choline, N-acetylaspartate/creatine, and choline/creatine ratios (p< 0.05) of the right basal ganglia. Patients with hepatocellular failure had a highly significant decrease in N-acetylaspartate (p<0.001) and significant decreases in choline, creatine, N-acetylaspartate/choline, N-acetylaspartate/creatine, and choline/creatine ratios (p<0.05 ) than in patients without complications. Conclusion: MRI abnormalities were detected in eight of 26 patients (30.7%), while MRS showed decreases in N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatinine, N-acetylaspartate/choline, N-acetylaspartate/creatine, and choline/creatine in all patients. MRS in patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease detects early neurological changes even on normal MR imaging.",,"Hussein, H.;Elsaadany, H. F.;Elghobashy, A. A.;Abdelrahman, H.;Talaat, M. A.;Zeid, A.

1288,Evaluation of exchangeable copper and relatively exchangeable copper in ATP7b-/- mice,"Aims and study: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which is responsible for toxic copper accumulation mainly in the liver and central nervous system. The diagnosis of WM is based on a combination of clinical and biological findings. Phenotypic heterogeneity can challenge diagnostic confirmation. Exchangeable copper (CuEXC) and its derived relative exchangeable copper (REC, ratio CuEXC/total serum copper, %) have recently been proposed as reliable diagnostic markers in WM. The aim of our study was to validate these new markers in ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice, an animal model of WD. Methods: ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> (group a) and wild-type mice (WT, group b) were bred and examined under the same conditions. Animals were divided into subgroups based on age at sacrifice (group 1a and 1b = 6 weeks, 2a and 2b = 20 weeks, 3a and 3b = 40 weeks, 4a and 4b = 50 weeks). The following plasma data were compared between groups: liver function tests, serum copper (Cu), CuEXC and REC. A histological analysis of the liver and determination of intrahepatic copper (CuIH) were also performed. A group of ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice received treatment with D-penicillamine from week 40 to sacrifice at week 50 (group 5). Results: 141 ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice and 117 WT mice were included in the study. No mouse died before the planned killing. In the WT groups, the histological analysis was consistently normal and the values of Cu, CuIH and CuEXC remained stable over time. Histological analysis of ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed progressive development of chronic liver damage (group 1a: isolated moderate inflammation (48%), group 4a: inflammatory fibrosis (100%) with cirrhosis (65% ) ). Cu, CuIH and CuEXC varied over time with peak values at week 20 for CuIH and week 40 for CuEXC and Cu. In each subgroup, CuIH and CuEXC were significantly higher in ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice than in WT mice (p<0.005). REC was also significantly higher in ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice (mean, 37.9 vs. 11.2%, p<0.001). A threshold of 20% for REC provided a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 100% regardless of age, gender or use of treatment (Group 4a: 34.9% vs. Group 5: 33%). Copper chelator significantly reduced liver fibrosis (p=0.03) and Cu (p=0.028) and lowered CuIH (p=0.29) and CuEXC (p=0.175). Conclusion: This study confirms the mouse model ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> as a reliable animal model for chronic liver disease due to copper overload. Relatively exchangeable copper is a sensitive and specific diagnostic marker in this model. Further studies are needed to confirm that CuEXC is a good biomarker to monitor the development of mouse WD, particularly when copper chelators are used.",,"Heissat, S.;Bost, M.;Hervieu, V.;Brunet, A.

1289,Analysis of Treatments for Wilson's Disease Using Patient-Specific Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (IPS) from Urine,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease is a monogenetic disorder of copper (Cu) metabolism resulting from mutations in the ATP7B gene. This leads to functional impairment of Cu excretion by the liver, followed by excessive Cu deposition in organs, mainly liver and brain. Patients show clinical heterogeneity ranging from acute or chronic liver failure and/or neurological symptoms. The progression of WD can be partially alleviated by zinc or chelating agents such as D-penicillamine and trientine. Although these treatments are usually effective, serious side effects have been reported in a significant proportion of WM patients. The molecular mechanisms of WM and the response to various treatments have not yet been fully characterized because samples from WM patients are scarce for analysis. Therefore, samples from WM patients are indispensable for investigations into the influence of ATP7B mutations on the development of the disease. The aim of the study is the development of a novel in vitro methodology for the generation of patient-specific WM cells, which can contribute not only to the pathogenesis but also to the drug efficacy. This approach can also be used as a tool to study new compounds as well as new gene correction methods. Methods: Urine from WD patients was processed to isolate renal epithelial cells, followed by reprogramming into WD iPS cells using non-integrating episomal vectors. After characterization, WD iPSCs were differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells for 14 days using critical growth factors. iPSC-Heps were characterized by qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, and immunocytochemistry before being treated with novel chelating agents under different Cu conditions. Results: Stable cell colonies emerged after culturing urine-derived cells and nucleofection generated iPSCs with pluripotent character. iPSC heps have been identified with similar morphology and gene expression (e.g. ATP7B) compared to primary human hepatocytes. The results showed a significant decrease in Cu content in WD iPSC-Heps after treatment with the novel chelator compared to untreated WD iPSC-Heps. Conclusions: Our results indicate that iPSCs derived from urine cells from WM patients can be reprogrammed and differentiated into iPSC-Heps. WD iPSC-Heps enables the establishment of a patient-specific in vitro platform for assessing drug efficacy. Therefore, this technology appears to be excellent for disease modeling and will enable the evaluation of new drugs for improved therapy of WD.",,"Sauer, V.;Niemietz, C.;Guttmann, S.;Stella, J.;Chandhok, G.;Zischka, H.;Zibert, A.;Schmidt, H.

1290,Retrospective study to evaluate the long-term outcomes of chelator-based treatment with trientine in patients with Wilson's disease who have been discontinued from D-penicillamine therapy,"Background and Objectives: Wilson's disease is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterized by impaired hepatic copper excretion caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, leading to copper accumulation in various organs including the liver and brain. It can be fatal if left untreated, with patients dying from liver failure or from complications of progressive neurological disease. The chelating agent trientine has proven to be an effective second-line treatment for patients with hepatic Wilson's disease. The aim of this study is to determine the long-term efficacy, ie the clinical course of neurological diseases and liver diseases, effects on copper metabolism, as well as the safety and tolerability of the use of trientine chelator-based treatments after discontinuation of treatment with D-penicillamine. METHODS: This is a non-randomized, multi-center, retrospective study in Europe involving approximately 90 patients with Wilson's disease. Inclusion criteria are physician-diagnosed WM patients with a “Leipzig” score >=3 aged between 6 and 90 years who have previously discontinued treatment with D-penicillamine and were subsequently treated with trientine for at least 6 months. D-penicillamine withdrawal may be due to lack of efficacy, safety, tolerability, or other reasons. Results: Information for three endpoints is collected. The efficacy endpoint will include assessment of the clinical course of neurological disease and liver disease and the impact on copper metabolism based on an investigator's score and baseline status and will be performed at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 month time points. The collection of data on serious adverse events occurring at the same study time points will provide evidence of a safety endpoint. A time to discontinuation endpoint to assess overall adherence to treatment with Trientine based on discontinuation due to adverse events and/or inadequate response will also be assessed.

1291,Prospective study to evaluate the long-term outcomes of trientine treatment in patients with Wilson's disease who have been discontinued from D-penicillamine therapy,"Background and Objectives: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which encodes a membrane-bound enzyme responsible for copper transport in the liver. Wilson's disease patients suffer from impaired copper metabolism, leading to accumulation of copper in various organs, including the liver and brain. Trientine, a chelating agent, is recommended as a second-line treatment for hepatic patients with Wilson's disease because it results in the removal of excess copper from the body, thereby preventing further copper accumulation. This study aims to determine the clinical course of copper stores, neurological and hepatic disorders, and quality of life in patients with Wilson's disease after initiation of trientine treatment and after discontinuation of d-penicillamine treatment. METHODS: This is a prospective portion of a non-randomized, multi-center study involving approximately 55 patients with Wilson's disease. Only patients who entered the retrospective portion of the study and continued to receive standard treatment with trientine were selected for this portion of the study. The duration of the prospective study is 12 months, with assessments being conducted at baseline (enrollment) and 6 and 12 months after study visit. Physical examination, blood and urine samples, completion of the Quality of Life Questionnaire, completion of the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), liver assessments (including non-invasive fibroscan), neurological status, adverse events, and concomitant medication assessments will be performed during the three study visits. Results: The primary endpoint to be assessed is the percentage of patients with stable disease after 12 months of treatment with trientine, based on investigator's score. The Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) is measured at 6 and 12 months and compared to baseline. At these times, the serum and urine parameters of the copper metabolism are also evaluated. Quality of life is also measured. Time to discontinuation of treatment due to side effects and/or inadequate response is also assessed. Conclusions: Complementary to the retrospective study, the results of this prospective study will inform the efficacy and safety of trientine and will provide valuable quality of life data in patients with Wilson's disease who were treated with trientine after stopping D-penicillamine.",,"Weiss, K.

1292,Liver transplantation in severe neurological forms of Wilson's disease; the French experience,"Background and Aims: The standard of care for Wilson's disease (WD) is a chelating agent of copper or zinc salts. Liver transplantation (LT) is indicated for acute liver failure or advanced cirrhosis. The indication of LT in neurological forms without liver decompensation remains controversial. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the effect of LT in WM with severe neurological symptoms without decompensated liver function. METHODS: From 2002 to 2015, fifteen patients (mean age 20.4 [12-41] years) in France underwent LT for severe neurological complications without neurological improvement despite drug treatment, without acute liver failure. All patients received chelating copper and 3 patients received chelating copper with zinc salts. Three patients had deteriorated after a temporary interruption of treatment without improvement after a well-conducted treatment. Results: The neurological symptoms were heterogeneous and combined dystonic postures, tremor, chorea and akineto-hypertensive syndrome. The mean age at diagnosis of WM was 17.7 [6-39] years and the interval time between deterioration and LT was 13 [4-24] months. The mean age at LT was 20.4 [12-41] years. All patients had a Child score of A at LT, and native liver analysis confirmed cirrhosis. The mean follow-up time after LT was 52.5 [2-156] months. Eleven patients (73%, mean age 19 [12-30] years) with a mean follow-up of 56 [2-156] months showed neurological improvement after LT, with a significant gain in quality of life. This improvement persists in 4 (27%) patients. The remaining four patients (27%, mean age 24 [15–42] years) showed no significant improvement in neurological symptoms and died of infectious complications after a mean interval of 13 [2–36] months. Three of the four patients who died had severe akineto-hypertensive syndrome and one had rigid dystonia restricting movements and swallowing. There was no difference between the waiting time in the living patient group and the deceased patient group (12.5 [3-31] months vs. 13.7 [7-24] months, respectively). Conclusions: Liver transplantation is an effective treatment option in Wilson's disease for patients with worsening neurological symptoms despite medical treatment, even in the absence of liver failure.

The purpose of this ongoing study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in patients aged 18 years and older with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease. METHODS: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson's disease who were treatment-naïve or treated with chelation or zinc therapy for <=28 days received 30 or 60 mg of WTX101 QD during the initiation period. Dosing was individualized after 6 weeks, guided by laboratory and clinical criteria. Periodic assessments included safety, liver disease status including synthetic function and modified Nazer score, change from baseline in free copper (assessed as non-ceruloplasmin bound copper (NCC) adjusted for plasma molybdenum concentration ), additional copper endpoints, and neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: The first six patients (age 18-53 years; 2 males) were followed in the study for 8-36 weeks. The modified Nazer score ranged from 1 to 5 and 5/6 had neurological manifestations at baseline. Reversibly elevated liver function tests associated with dose escalations per protocol were observed in the first 2 patents. After reducing the initial dose from 30 mg BID (total 60 mg/day) to 30 mg QD and escalating the dose to a maximum daily dose of 60 mg, WTX101 was well tolerated with no SAEs and few AEs. Liver status (ALT, INR and bilirubin) and modified Nazer score improved or remained stable. Elevated baseline plasma NCC levels, adjusted for molybdenum, normalized within 3 months on average, with NCC levels continuing to decrease in the few patients who stayed longer on treatment. Other copper measurements (exchangeable copper, total serum copper, 24-hour urinary copper excretion) indicate a similar decoppering pattern. UWDRS scores improved in all patients with neurological manifestations. At 3 months, the neurological exam score (Part III) was reduced from approximately 30 to <10, with continuous improvement thereafter. Daily activity status (Part II) showed a similar improvement. Conclusions: WTX101 appears to be safe and well-tolerated in patients with Wilson's disease. With the improvement in clinical (hepatic and neurological) and laboratory evaluations, including copper control in these first patients, further clinical evaluation is warranted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 for the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Weiss, K.

Examination for abnormal liver enzymes revealed negative hepatitis B antigen, undetectable HBV DNA, negative immune markers, but low serum ceruloplasm (<0.08 g/l). She was also found to have elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed moderate fatty infiltration of the liver. The copper excretion in the 24-hour urine was carried out and was increased (1.69 µmol/d). Because of her high urinary copper excretion, she was further evaluated for Wilson's disease. The slit lamp examination revealed no evidence of Kayser-Fleischer rings. She then underwent a liver biopsy, which showed features consistent with moderate steatohepatites, suspicious but not diagnostic of Wilson's disease. Quantitation of copper in hepatic parenchyma showed a dry tissue copper weight of 4.42 mmol/g, consistent with the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD). Subsequent MRI revealed no central nervous system involvement in Wilson's disease. The patient was started on penicillamine 750 mg and continued counseling on weight loss strategies. Conclusions. Wilson's disease is traditionally described as a disease of children and young adults. However, there are several case reports describing the disease in older adults. The diagnostic features and genetic background of patients with late-onset Wilson's disease are no different from those with early onset. This case presents a diagnostic dilemma and an approach to diagnosing Wilson's disease in an elderly patient whose history, physical examination, and other findings are consistent with NAFLD. The most frequently observed histological abnormality in patients with Wilson's disease is steatohepatitis, which is also present in NAFLD. With increasing prevalence and detectability of NAFLD, clinical suspicion also increases. This case underscores the importance of considering the diagnosis of late-onset Wilson's disease in this population and presents an approach to diagnosis and treatment in such a patient.",,"Mitchell, R.;Ko, H.",2016,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/4792898,0,0,
1295,Wilson's disease: Acute dystonia during treatment with SSRIs or SNRIs,"Objectives: We present a patient with Wilson's disease who developed partially reversible dystonia while being treated with venlafaxine or sertraline. Methods: A patient with genetically verified Wilson's disease (ATP7B p.Met769fs; p.His1069Gln comp. het.) was clinically followed up with serial MRI, 18F-FDG-PET and 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT. The relevant literature was reviewed. Results: A 31-year-old man developed anxiety and depression. Treatment with venlafaxine 75 mg/day improved psychiatric symptoms, but perioral dystonia developed within 2 days. Diplopia, action tremor and weakness were noted during medication with venlafaxine 150 mg/d. Subsequently, Wilson's disease was diagnosed and copper chelation therapy with trientine dihydrochloride was initiated. Discontinuation of venlafaxine improved motor symptoms, but they returned after it was reinstated during treatment with trientine. Perioral and tongue dystonia, dysarthria, blepharospasm and gait disturbances also occurred under medication with sertraline 50 mg/d, some of which were reversible after discontinuation of sertraline. The patient's anxiety was symptomatically controlled with oxazepam without worsening of the extrapyramidal symptoms. The MRI showed hyperintensities in the pons, mesencephalon, claustrum and pyramidal tract. Glucose metabolism and dopamine reuptake capacity were bilaterally reduced in the basal ganglia. Conclusions: Wilson's disease increases the susceptibility to side effects of SSRIs and SNRIs. Acute dystonia was previously described in a WM patient receiving clomipramine [1]. Both the imbalance in copper metabolism inherent in WD [2] and treatment with SSRIs [3,4] or SNRIs [5] are known causes of dystonia, and we propose an additive effect when both factors are present simultaneously. The patient described presented imaging abnormalities in the midbrain and upper brainstem, suggesting involvement of monoaminergic neurons.",,"Wictor, L.;Wictorin, K.;Widner, H.;Puschmann, A.",2016,January,,0,0,
1296,Late onset Wilson's disease with central pontine and extrapontine MRI changes,"Objectives: The classic radiographic depiction of Wilson's disease (WD) with the ""giant panda"" face is typically used to distinguish WD from other extrapyramidal diseases. Central pontine myelinolysis-like (CPM-like) changes in WD are rarely reported and differ from the classic, well-known osmotic demyelination. Although CPM-like changes on MRI are common in young WM patients, there are no published reports of such a radiological picture in the exceptional cases of late-onset WM. We report a late-onset WD with sequential MRI changes responding to decoppering therapy. METHODS: A 64-year-old man with pulmonary sarcoidosis presented with a 2-year history of worsening axial ataxia, postural, kinetic and resting tremor, and cognitive decline. His examination was also indicative of generalized hyperreflexia, Babinski's sign, and the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings. The WD diagnosis was confirmed with low ceruloplasmin and with the presence of a homozygous mutation in the ATP7B gene. Results: MRI showed diffuse T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the pons bordering on midbrain hyperintensity at symptom onset, focal hyperintensity in the left thalamus, and generalized cortical atrophy. After nine months of chelation with trientine, partial resolution of T2 hyperintensity in the pons was observed, while thalamic hyperintensity became less prominent. Conclusions: WD must be considered in all patients presenting with hepatic or neurological symptoms without a definitive diagnosis, regardless of age. WM and CPM-like radiographic changes in older adult WM patients may be underrecognized, but genetic confirmation and clinical assessment results should guide treatment.",,"Biller, T.;Fatterpekar, G.;Nirenberg, M.;Brys, M.",2016,January,,0,0,
1297,Zinc and copper in Alzheimer's,"In a recent meta-analysis examining the association of zinc levels with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by Ventriglia and colleagues, it was found that serum zinc was significantly decreased in AD patients compared to healthy controls. However, such a finding does not necessarily suggest the causal role of low zinc in the pathophysiology of this neurodegenerative disease. Based on the available evidence, free copper toxicosis may play a causal role in age-related AD and zinc therapy may be a rational causal treatment. However, a randomized controlled clinical trial to test a definitive hypothesis is needed before any conclusions can be drawn about the value of zinc supplements in the treatment of AD.

1298,A young boy with elevated aminotransferases on physical exam - Two novel missense mutations associated with Wilson's disease have been found. [Chinese],"3-year-old boy had abnormal liver function detected on physical examination 5 months prior to admission. He had no symptoms such as anorexia, anorexia, and jaundice, had normal growth and development, and showed no hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory testing revealed significantly reduced ceruloplasmin (35 mg/l) and negative hepatotropic virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus. There were normal muscle enzymes, blood glucose and blood ammonia, and negative liver-specific autoantibodies. The boy had a negative KF ring and normal copper in 24-hour urine (0.56 mumol/L). ATP7B genetic testing of the boy, his sister and their parents detected two new missense mutations in the boy and his sister, ie compound heterozygous mutations in exon 7 (c.2075T>C, p.L692P) and exon 13 (c. 3044T>C, p.L1015P) inherited from their father or mother. Wilson's disease was confirmed by genetic diagnosis in the boy and his sister. The boy and his sister were put on a low-copper diet. The boy was given penicillamine to decopper and a zinc supplement to stop copper absorption. His sister only received zinc supplementation as no clinical symptoms were observed. The boy showed normal liver function at follow-up after 3 months of treatment. Copyright © 2015 Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics.",,"Zhu, Y.;Deng, S. Y.;Wan, C.

1299,Effective treatment of D-penicillamine-induced elastosis perforans serpiginosa with ALA-PDT,"case of D-penicillamine (DPA)-induced serpiginous elastosis perforans (EPS) in a 32-year-old Chinese man was reported. The presentation lasted two years and defied traditional medical treatment. He was then treated with 7.6% 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-induced photodynamic therapy (PDT) by a 633 nm LED light at dose levels of 130 J/cm2 for each session for a total of 3 sessions one week apart began. The patient was well tolerated and responded well to this new approach to DPA-induced EPS with no side effects.

1300,The protection offered by chelation therapy in post-MI diabetics could be replicated by high-dose zinc supplementation,"The recent Trial to Assess Chelat Therapy (TACT) study, which enrolled subjects who had previously suffered a myocardial infarction, provided strong evidence that intravenous chelation therapy can significantly reduce the risk of mortality and vascular events in diabetics, while in No discernible benefit was observed in non-diabetics -diabetics. It has been plausibly suggested that this reflects a role for transition metal ions - iron or copper - in the genesis of advanced glycation endproducts, key mediators of diabetic complications that can destabilize plaque. Since phlebotomy therapy does not prevent vascular events in diabetics, we hypothesize that labile copper may be the main culprit, the removal of which by chelation mediated the benefit observed with TACT. If this is the case, strategies that are less time- and labor-intensive than chelation therapy could provide comparable benefits. A number of recent studies report that the copper-specific, orally active chelator trientine can reduce the risk of a range of diabetic complications in rodents; A clinical study of this agent showed some decrease in left ventricular mass in diabetics with ventricular hypertrophy. However, until this remedy becomes cheaper, high-dose zinc supplementation may be a more viable alternative. Zinc counteracts the absorption and redox activity of copper by inducing the antioxidant protein metallothionein, which tightly binds copper. A large number of studies show that increased expression of metallothionein reduces the risk of tissue damage in diabetic rodents, and in some of these studies metallothionein expression was increased by supplemental zinc. Zinc supplementation also slightly improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetics and may reduce risk of diabetes by protecting pancreatic beta cells from oxidative stress. A long-term study to assess the effects of high-dose zinc supplementation in diabetics, assessing the risk of mortality, vascular events, and diabetic complications may be warranted. Histidine, which readily forms complexes with copper that possess superoxide dismutase activity, also has the potential to reduce the contribution of loosely bound copper to AGE formation; Furthermore, in a recent clinical study, supplemental histidine improved insulin sensitivity and exerted anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in women with metabolic syndrome. Since ascorbate can reduce labile copper and thereby increase its pathogenicity, the effects of high-dose ascorbate supplementation on cardiovascular risk in diabetics should be further investigated.

1301,"Chelation therapy for intoxications with mercury, lead and copper","In this review, we provide an update on the appropriate use of chelating agents in the treatment of mercury, lead, and copper compound intoxications. The relatively new chelators meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonate (DMPS) can effectively mobilize both mercury and lead deposits in the urine. These drugs can be administered orally and have relatively low toxicity compared to the classic antidote dimercaptopropanol (BAL). d-Penicillamine is commonly used for copper overload, although 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid or tetrathiomolybdate may be more suitable alternatives today.

1302,A neuropsychological comparison of siblings with neurological versus hepatic symptoms of Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) (also known as hepatolenticular degeneration) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal copper metabolism, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 30,000. The clinical features associated with WD vary widely. However, subtypes generally reflect neurological, hepatic, and psychiatric symptoms. This case study reports on two brothers who were recently diagnosed with WM. Neurological symptoms and cognitive deficits presented in one brother (BL) as extrapyramidal features, while the other brother (AL) presented only hepatic symptoms. Extensive neuropsychological testing was performed on both siblings to compare cognitive profiles. Results for BL showed significant impairment in motor function and information processing speed, which significantly hampered him in school. In addition to reduced visual and verbal memory, working memory and attention, aspects of executive dysfunction were also evident. Results for AL showed evidence of verbal memory difficulties and aspects of executive dysfunction. A comparison of the different and common cognitive features of the presented cases is made with regard to the implications for early intervention and management of cognitive difficulties.

1305,Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease is a rare progressive genetic disorder of copper metabolism associated with hepatolenticular degeneration. Left untreated, this will inevitably lead to severe disability and death. It is very easy to miss the diagnosis, but if caught early, effective treatments are available that can prevent or reverse many manifestations of this disorder. The role of copper in disease pathogenesis, along with clinical, biochemical and genetic markers, are critical to establishing a definitive diagnosis. Drug therapy includes several chelating agents (eg, penicillamine, trientine) and zinc salts. Liver transplantation corrects the underlying pathophysiology and can be life-saving.

1307,Peripheral small fiber neuropathy in Wilson's disease: An in vivo documentation by confocal corneal microscopy,"PURPOSE. Wilson disease (WD) is a disorder of hepatic copper metabolism that results in copper accumulation in hepatocytes and in extrahepatic organs such as the brain and cornea. The aim of this study was to investigate central corneal changes and in particular to assess the parameters of the corneal subbasal nerve plexus (SBNP) in patients with MV using corneal confocal microscopy (CCM). METHODS. A total of 24 WM-affected patients and 24 healthy controls were included in this cross-sectional comparative study. One eye of each subject was examined to quantify various corneal parameters. Mean cell diameter and mean cell density of the epithelium; Number of fibers (NF), nerve fiber length density (NFLD), number of branches (NBr), number of beads (NBe) and fiber tortuosity (FT) of the SBNP; mean cell density of keratocytes of the anterior, middle and posterior stroma; and mean cell density, endothelial polymegatism and pleomorphism, and central corneal sensitivity were analyzed. RESULTS. Wilson's disease induced significant changes in SBNP and corneal epithelium. NFLD (P<0.0001), NF (P<0.001), NBe (P<0.025), and NBr (P<0.0001) were significantly lower, while FT (P<0.0001) was compared in WD subjects was significantly higher than controls. In addition, mean epithelial cell diameter (P<0.0001) and mean epithelial cell density (P<0.0001) were significantly higher and lower, respectively, compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS. CCM showed significant corneal changes in SBNP with concomitant corneal epithelial changes in WD, demonstrating the presence of peripheral small fiber neuropathy in these patients. CCM can aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral nervous system involvement in WM. Copyright © 2015, The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

1308,Liver disease in adults caused by inborn errors of metabolism: review and update,"Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are a group of genetic disorders that have diverse clinical manifestations and can affect multiple organ systems. The age of onset varies widely, but IEMs primarily affect the pediatric population. However, in recent decades, advances in management and new therapeutic approaches have led to improvements in IEM patient care. As a result, many patients with IEMs survive into adulthood and develop their own complications. In addition, some IEMs appear in adulthood. It is important that internists have the knowledge and familiarity with these disorders as more adult patients with IEM are projected to require continued care in the near future. The review focuses on Wilson's disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, citrin deficiency, and HFE-associated hemochromatosis typically found in the adult population. Clinical manifestations and pathophysiology, particularly those related to liver disease, as well as diagnosis and treatment are discussed in detail.

1310,Neuronal plasticity and memory: molecular mechanism,"In addition to neurodegenerative diseases, the decoding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of memory was an important topic that includes the areas of learning and memory. Synapses accumulate cognitive information from lifelong changes in their molecular and structural composition. Current memory storage models identify the post-translational modification essential for short-term information storage and mRNA translation for long-term information storage. However, the precise presentation of these modifications has not been summarized at the individual synapse level. Therefore, we describe here the spatiotemporal reorganization of synaptic plasticity at the dendritic spine level to elucidate the mechanism by which synaptic substructures are remodeled; At the molecular level, however, such mechanisms are still fairly unclear. From this it was concluded that the existing mechanisms do not fully work out memory storage processes. Further efforts are therefore encouraged to describe the mechanism of neuronal connectivity also at the chemical level, including inter- or intramolecular binding patterns at the synaptic level, which may be an enabling and crucial step in memory storage.

Material: From 2000 to 2012, seven pregnant women were admitted. None had a liver transplant (Ltx), the varicose veins were stage 1. Each of them was consulted by the obstetrician, transplant surgeon and anesthetist. The patient's condition during pregnancy, labor and postpartum was analyzed. Results: The pregnancy was physiological in five cases. One was diagnosed with impending miscarriage and treated with progestogens, two patients had tocolytics. A required variceal banding twice. In three patients, thrombocytopenia worsened with a platelet count < 70 g/l (up to 59 g/l). They received a platelet transfusion prior to delivery. Significant hipoproteinemia (4.7 g/l) occurred in one case. In one case GDM G1 and oligohydramnios were found. All women delivered at term (37-40Hbd). All underwent general anesthesia using remifentanil. There were no fluctuations in MAP and HR. Cut to delivery time was 2.5 minutes. Time from opioid administration to delivery was <4 min. All infants were born in good condition, weight 10-90 percentile. Regional anesthesia is contraindicated in patients with thrombocytopenia. In patients with esophageal varices, a sudden increase in heart rate and blood pressure can cause bleeding. Conclusion: Patients with portal hypertension can deliver at term. It's a high-risk pregnancy. In this group, it is desirable to shorten the second phase of labor or complete it by cesarean section under general anesthesia with remifentanyl, which allows the desired analgesia to be achieved without complications in the newborn.

1316,No increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease during long-term follow-up,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Data on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with Wilson's disease are scarce. We determine HCC risk in a well-defined cohort of Wilson patients. Methods: All patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson's disease (Leipzig score>=4) in three Dutch university hospitals were included in this retrospective cohort study. End of follow-up was defined as date of diagnosis of HCC, liver transplantation, death, or last available hospital visit. A meta-analysis was also performed to determine the incidence and mortality rate of HCC in Wilson's disease based on all published cohorts. Results: A total of 130 patients with Wilson's disease were followed for a median follow-up of 15 years (range 0.1-51.2). At baseline, 74 patients had cirrhosis (57% of total patients: 64% compensated and 36% decompensated). At the end of follow-up, liver disease severity was improved, stable, or worsening in 20%, 46%, and 24% of all cases (10% unknown), respectively. Two patients developed HCC (one despite excellent decoppering after 50 years of follow-up, the other with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease). The estimated annual risk of HCC for all patients was 0.09% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01-0.28). The subgroup analysis in cirrhotic patients resulted in an annual HCC risk of 0.14% (95% CI: 0.02-0.46). The meta-analysis showed an annual HCC risk of 0.04% (95% CI: 0.01-0.10) and an HCC mortality rate of 2.6/10,000 person-years (95% CI: 0.7 -7.0). Conclusions: Even with cirrhosis, the risk of HCC in Wilson's disease is low. Our data do not support regular HCC surveillance in Wilson's disease.

1317,Effects of tetrathiomolybdate and penicillamine on concentrations of hydroxyl radicals and free copper in the brain: An in vivo microdialysis study,"Wilson's disease is an inherited condition characterized by excessive accumulation of copper. The commonly used drug D-penicillamine (PA) or trientine both cause a high incidence (10-50%) of neurological deterioration that rarely occurs with tetrathiomolybdate (TM) treatment. To investigate the mechanisms of neurological deterioration after initiation of chelation therapy, this study examined brain hydroxyl radicals and free copper in vivo. On days 3, 7, 14 and 21 after PA or TM administration, striatal hydroxyl radical levels of both TX mice and controls were assessed by terephthalic acid (TA) in combination with microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Within the same microdialysis samples, free copper was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that both hydroxyl radicals and free copper in the striatum of TX mice increased significantly during PA administration but were not increased when TM was administered. These results suggested that the further increased brain free copper and oxidative stress caused by some chelators might contribute to neurological deterioration. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This deletion results in the activation of 3 cryptic splice sites: an AG-acceptor splice site at nt positions 578-579, creating a different breakpoint, and the first 577 nts of exon 2, an acceptor and a donor splice site, into the nt -Removed positions 20363-4 and 20456-7, respectively, in intron 1, resulting in activation of a 94-bp cryptic Alu exon, which is incorporated into the mature transcript. The resulting alternative transcript contains a TAG stop codon in the first amino acid position of the cryptic exon, likely resulting in a truncated nonfunctional protein. This study demonstrates that intron exonization can also occur in humans through naturally occurring gross deletions. The results suggest that the combination of DNA and RNA analyzes can be used to molecularly characterize gross ATP7B deletions, thereby improving genetic counseling and diagnosis of WD. In addition, these studies help to better establish new molecular mechanisms that cause Wilson's disease. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier BV.",,"Mameli, E.;Lepori, M.

1321,Wilson's disease associated with anetoderma,"Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper homeostasis with predominantly hepatic and neuropsychiatric involvement. Anetoderma is a rare benign condition characterized by focal damage to dermal elastic tissue. Previous reports have described this skin condition associated with prolonged d-penicillamine therapy. Case Report: A 26-year-old man was referred for evaluation of an asymptomatic elevation in aminotransferase levels. The tests showed negative markers for chronic viral and autoimmune hepatitis, low ceruloplasmin levels and increased urinary copper excretion. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis with moderate activity and severe bridging fibrosis. Mutation analysis revealed a composite heterozygous genotype and supported the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Skin lesions consisting of numerous white to pale papules less than 7–8 mm in diameter with a central prominence located on the upper part of the body were also observed at the time of the initial physical examination. Primary anetoderma was determined based on presentation and skin biopsy findings. Therapy with d-penicillamine at a daily dose of 1500 mg was started and during the 12-month follow-up period the aminotransferase decreased to normal and the skin lesions remained unchanged. Conclusion: In our opinion, this case represents a first-reported association between Wilson's disease and primary anetoderma. The possible mechanism behind this relationship is discussed.

[Japanese],"37-year-old male patient in his late teens presented with psychiatric symptoms, dysarthria, limb dystonia, increased tendon reflexes, and a Kayser-Fleischer ring. Laboratory tests have shown decreased concentrations of copper and ceruloplasmin in the serum and increased levels of copper in the urine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed high-signal-intensity lesions in the bilateral putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, and brainstem on T<inf>2</inf>-weighted images (T<inf>2</inf>WI) . Based on the MRI results and laboratory data, we diagnosed this patient with Wilson's disease (WD). He was treated with trientine hydrochloride and zinc acetate. Four months after starting treatment, the patient's symptoms began to improve. In a follow-up MRI performed 6 years after treatment, the high signal lesions had completely disappeared on T2WI. However, the low signal intensity lesions in the basal ganglia had spread to the caudate nuclei. Here we discuss the characteristics of MRI changes in WD after treatment. The pathological basis for the low signal intensity lesions on T2WI in WD remains unclear.

1325,Increased prevalence of subcutaneous lipomas in patients with Wilson's disease,"Objectives: To determine the prevalence and characteristics of lipomas in patients with Wilson's disease. Background: Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to accumulation of copper in the liver and central nervous tissue. Subcutaneous lipomas were frequently identified by the authors during clinical examinations of patients with Wilson's disease. This is the first study to analyze the prevalence and progression of lipoma development in patients with Wilson's disease. Study: Eighty consecutive patients attending a tertiary care center were evaluated for the presence of subcutaneous lipomas. RESULTS: Subcutaneous lipomas were found on examination in 21 (26%) of the 80 patients with Wilson's disease. Multiple subcutaneous lipomas were present in 16 (76%) of the 21 affected patients. Lipomas were mainly found on the extremities and trunk. Neither the initial presentation nor the decoppering treatment influenced the presence or course of lipomas in these patients. Conclusions: Subcutaneous lipoma formation is more common in patients with Wilson's disease than in the general population. We propose that the presence of lipomas contributes to the differential diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Copyright © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",,"Schaefer, M.;Gotthardt, D.

1327,An obese patient with abnormal liver enzymes: not always non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. [Dutch],"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease in the western world. Even in patients with multiple risk factors for metabolic syndrome, one must remain vigilant and rule out other causes of liver disease, such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, and storage diseases. If treating NAFLD with weight loss does not improve abnormal liver function tests, further investigation is warranted. One of the most famous mimics of NAFLD is Wilson's disease. This is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation in affected tissues, primarily the liver and brain. Liver disease in Wilson's disease can present with a wide spectrum of abnormalities, ranging from asymptomatic abnormal liver function tests to liver cirrhosis and even acute liver failure. Diagnosing Wilson's disease is extremely important because the disease—if left untreated—is universally fatal. Treatment consists of chelation therapy (D-penicillamine, trientine, zinc) or liver transplantation.",,"Beyls, C.;Arts, J.;Holvoet, A.;Van Hootegem, Ph;Dalle, I.;Cassiman, D.;Decock, S.",2015,2022-12-15 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.2143/TVG.71.24.2002023,0,0,

Our knowledge of Wilson's disease has increased dramatically; However, the understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation and the diverse effects of copper toxicity as a basis for targeted and individualized therapy strategies is still insufficient. Clinical manifestations include liver disease ranging from mild hepatitis to acute liver failure or cirrhosis and/or neurological symptoms such as dystonia, tremor, dysarthria and psychiatric disorders.

Trientine is typically used as a second-line treatment for patients with this condition. We present a case of a gross overdose of Trientine (60 g) that resulted in self-limiting dizziness and vomiting without further clinical sequelae or significant biochemical abnormalities. This case demonstrates that trientine has a good safety profile and could therefore be used as a first-line therapy in patients with Wilson's disease who suffer from psychiatric complications and may be at risk of self-harm.

1333,Elevated serum natriuretic peptide and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a copper metabolism disorder characterized by excessive copper deposition in the body. It is reported that abnormal copper metabolism has been linked to cardiovascular disease. BNP and MMP2/9 were biomarkers for congestive heart failure (CHF). There are rare studies examining whether serum concentrations of BNP, MMP2 and/or MMP9 are altered in patients with WM. In this study, we determine whether serum levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2 and 9 are elevated in patients with WM. Serum BNP, MMP2 and MMP9 were measured by ELISA in 34 patients with hepatic WM, 68 patients with neurological WM and 33 healthy controls. We found that serum BNP levels were higher in patients with neurological WM than in healthy controls (p=0.033). Serum MMP2 levels were higher in patients with hepatic (p=0.009) and neurological (p=0.0004) WD than controls. Serum MMP9 levels were higher in patients with neurological MV than in patients with hepatic MV (p=0.002) and controls (p=0.00005) and were higher in patients with hepatic MV than in controls (p=0.03 ). Serum BNP levels were negatively correlated with ceruloplasmin (p=0.017, r=-0.215), while serum (p=0.019, r=-0.221) and MMP9 (p=0.011, r=-0.231) were negatively correlated in patients with WD with ceruloplasmin.

We present here a series of four cases of sclerosing cholangitis masquerading as Wilson's disease. Cases of true Wilson's disease had significantly less ceruloplasmin (6 vs. 16 mg/dL) and higher copper levels in 24-hour urine (322.3 vs. 74.5 µg/day) compared to mimics. Initially low serum ceruloplasmin levels normalized in mimics and this can be used as a diagnostic indicator.

1335,Therapeutic efficacy of D-penicillamine nanoparticles in the rat model of non-Wilson's brain copper toxicosis,"Animal models of Wilson's disease (WD), viz. Long Evans cinnamon rats rarely show neurological symptoms, which hampers the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat neurological manifestations in WM patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intraperitoneally injected copper lactate over 90 days, particularly on copper and zinc levels in liver, kidney and brain tissue; Expression of hepatic metallothionein-I (MT-I) and Atp7b gene; and MT-III and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene in brain, biochemical parameters and neurobehavioural functions of male Wistar rats and therapeutic evaluation of orally administered D-penicillamine-encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles for 90 days in Cu-poisoned Wistar rats . Reverse transcription PCR and Morris water maze test were used for expression and neurobehavioral studies. Copper-poisoned animals showed significantly increased levels of ceruloplasmin, serum and urine copper and decreased serum acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, increased expression of the hepatic MTI gene with impaired neuromuscular coordination and spatial memory. However, no changes in the expression levels of the hepatic Ap7b gene were observed; and MT-III and AChE gene in brain. Cu-poisoned rats showed a significant increase in copper content in liver, brain and kidney tissue (increase of 99.1, 73 and 74.9%, respectively), decreased zinc content in the liver (decrease of 40%) and, interestingly, increased zinc content in the brain (77.1% increase) compared to control rats. Histopathological studies revealed grade 4 copper deposits in liver and grade 1 copper-associated proteins in liver tissues of test rats by rhodanine and orcein stains, respectively. Astrocytic swelling was observed in cerebral cortical sections of brain tissues from Cu-poisoned rats. Therapy with D-penicillamine-encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles resulted in a significant reduction in liver and brain Cu levels, serum ceruloplasmin levels and an increase in serum AChE activity with an improvement in neurological functions. In summary, chronic copper toxicity can lead to increased liver and brain copper levels, increased hepatic MT-I gene expression, ceruloplasmin levels, and neurobehavioural disorders by disrupting acetylcholine-modulated neurotransmission; However, D-penicillamine-encapsulated nanoparticles can reverse impairments induced by chronic Cu intoxication to a significant extent in Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Badyal, R.;Vasishta, R.

1336,Surviving Wilson's crisis without liver transplantation,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD), a disorder of copper excretion, is a rare but important indication for urgent liver transplantation. Chelation therapy is ineffective in acute Wilson's crisis, requiring liver transplantation as the treatment of choice. Case Report: A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after feeling weak and exhausted and complaining of RUQ abdominal pain and hematuria for 5 days. She has been suffering for the past 4 months from increasing weakness, loss of singing voice and symptoms of biliary colic on fatty foods. She has recently started birth control but had no other history. On admission she was jaundiced with total bilirubin 10.8, direct bilirubin 3.1, AST 177, ALT 11, alkaline phosphatase 8, albumin 3.4, INR 1.6, hemoglobin 6.6, MCV 112, white blood cells 18, 0, platelets 195, creatinine 1.47, bilirubinuria and bilateral pleural effusions. Abdominal ultrasound revealed ascites, dilated common bile duct, and biliary sludge. It was recorded on the PICU. She had Coombs negative hemolytic anemia requiring seven units of blood in seven days. She had paracentesis on day 2 with a SAAG consistent with portal hypertension. The patient underwent a comprehensive examination at the hospital with no responses, and on the third day she was started on steroids empirically. Her ceruloplasmin was 21, which is low normal. She underwent liver biopsy during cholecystectomy for persistent RUQ pain, showing cirrhosis and swollen glycogen-rich hepatocytes, suggesting glycogen storage disease; this returned after her discharge. She recovered from the hemolytic anemia and was sent home on day 14 on steroids. She followed up with GI and was ordered 24 hour urine copper, finding 144 cups of copper. An immediate ophthalmological referral resulted in Kayser-Fleisher rings. She was diagnosed with WD and started Trientine. Follow-up labs showed a decrease in urinary copper, an ATP7B gene mutation, and an improvement in her singing voice and fatigue. This case represents an often fatal presentation of WD without a transplant. This patient survived without a transplant and I wonder if steroids played a role in her recovery without a transplant.

1337,"nationwide, population-based epidemiology and burden of disease of Wilson's disease in South Korea in 2009-2013","Background/Aims: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited copper metabolism disorder in which copper accumulates in the organ, particularly in the liver and central nervous system. As a rare disease, the population-based epidemiology of WD is largely unknown. This study aimed to examine the nationwide, population-based prevalence, comorbidity, treatment regimen, and direct medical costs of WD in South Korea from 2009 to 2013. Methods: Using 2 major data sources from Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) claims. Rare Disease Database and Registry Program Database from 2009 to 2013 in Korea, we identified all patients with WM who were registered by a physician with the International Classification of Diseases Code (ICD-10) for WM (E83.0) and with the registry entry ( V174) for the rare disease in Korea. The five-year data included 1,509 patients linked to information such as age, gender, comorbidity ICD-10 codes, medications prescribed, and direct medical costs. Results: The gross overall prevalence of WD was 2.38/100,000 persons and showed an increasing trend over the 5 years (2.27, 2.28, 2.35, 2.45 and 2.53/100,000 in 2009 -2013). Most (72%) patients were diagnosed before the age of 30, and 1.4% had an additional disease code for a neurological/mental disorder. Liver cirrhosis and liver cancer were found in 33.2% and 9.9%, respectively. Liver transplantation was performed in 4.6% of patients. D-penicillamine, trientine, and zinc were prescribed for 58.3%, 29.7%, and 13.9% of patients, respectively. The average annual total treatment cost per person for WD was $1,643.15.

1338,Functional analysis and drug response to zinc and D-penicillamine in stable ATP7B-mutated liver cell lines,"Aim: To evaluate the in vitro functional analysis and drug response to zinc (Zn) and D-penicillamine (DPA) treatment of the most common disease-causing ATP7B mutations observed in patients with Wilson disease (WD). Background: WD is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the copper transporter ATP7B. More than 600 disease-causing mutations have been described. Left untreated, WD is fatal. Commonly used drugs to reverse Cu toxicity in WD include direct chelation by DPA or metallothionein induction using Zn salts. The effect of these drugs in rescuing hepatocytes with individual mutations is not known. Methods: Common homozygous mutations in Europe/USA, Asia and India were selected for functional analysis. A hepatic ATP7B knockout cell line previously established by our group (PLoS ONE, 9:e98809, 2014) was used to generate stable mutant cell lines. ATP7B gene and protein expression was determined for all mutant cell lines. Cu-induced cell survival, apoptosis and intracellular trafficking were studied. Cell viability against Cu toxicity was determined upon treatment with Zn, DPA, or both. Results: ATP7B mRNA was similar, while protein expression varied between the different mutant cell lines. Colocalization studies with late endosome2 lysosome marker lamps suggested impaired transport in the presence or absence of Cu. All mutant cell lines showed different levels of ATP7B activity against Cu-induced toxicity and apoptosis, with p.H1069Q showing moderate ATP7B activity. When treated with Zn, DPA, or both, most cell lines showed a characteristic response to treatment. DPA was more effective than Zn in rescuing cells against Cu toxicity. Only the combination of Zn and DPA treatment was able to rescue the mutant cells similar to wild type. Conclusions: The study provided insights into the genotype-phenotype correlation in WD. Different ATP7B mutations showed different sensitivity to Cu with high/moderate and low ATP7B activity. Single ATP7B mutations showed a genotype-specific response to treatment. The combination treatment with Zn and DPA showed maximal survival of the liver cells. Our data suggest that knowledge of mutation-specific in vitro functional analysis and application of Zn/DPA combination therapy can benefit the prognosis of WM patients.",,"Chandhok, G.;Sauer, V.;Niemietz, C.;Zibert, A.;Schmidt, H.

1339,Hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with Wilson's disease: results from a single center registry of 262 patients,"Introduction: Although hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a recognized complication of cirrhosis of various etiologies, HCC in Wilson's disease is believed to be extremely rare. About 30 cases have been reported worldwide, showing the rarity of this complication. We conducted this study to determine the frequency and characteristics of HCC in a cohort of 262 patients over 19 years of age. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the case records of patients with Wilson's disease from the Wilson's disease registry maintained from 1996 to 2014. Diagnosis of Wilson's disease was based on a score > 4 developed by the International Group in Leipzig (J Hepatol 2012;56:671-85). Patients were treated with D-penicillamine with or without zinc sulfate. The patients were followed up regularly at intervals of 3-6 months. Patients with HCC were initially evaluated by abdominal ultrasound followed by a contrast-enhanced CT scan. RESULTS: We identified 3 cases of HCC among 262 patients with Wilson's disease. All 3 had cirrhosis with portal hypertension at the time of diagnosis, as evidenced by esophageal varices and ascites. The characteristics of these patients are presented in the table. All three had multicentric HCC and presented resistant complications of portal hypertension such as variceal bleeding, resistant ascites and one with hemoperitoneum. Given the advanced nature of HCC at presentation, only supportive care could be provided. Conclusions: The HCC incidence in a large cohort of 262 patients is 1.1%. Although low, patients with WD also have a risk of HCC. HCC appears to be aggressive in our Wilson's disease cohort. Patients with Wilson disease must undergo regular screening for early detection of HCC, similar to other etiologies. Those who are inadequately chelated appear to be at higher risk for HCC.

1340,Zinc monotherapy for young pediatric patients with presymptomatic Wilson's disease: A two-center experience in Japan,"Purpose: We previously reported that a reasonable goal in treating young pediatric patients with Wilson's disease (WD) with zinc is to keep the 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the first 1-2 years (Mizuochi, et al. JPGN 2011;53:365). Here we aimed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for young pediatric patients with WM and to establish appropriate benchmarks for maintenance therapy. METHODS: We conducted a retro- and prospective study to examine 7 girls (mean age 5 years, range 4-8) who met diagnostic criteria for WD and prior to symptom onset at Kurume University Hospital and Okinawa Chubu Hospital exclusively treated with zinc acetate in Japan. No additional WD sequelae such as jaundice, hepatomegaly, or neurological abnormalities were noted. We monitored serum AST and ALT, non-ceruloplasmin serum copper, and 24-hour urinary copper for 2–7 years after initiation of zinc monotherapy. Additional monitoring included white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, serum total bilirubin, albumin, iron, amylase, lipase, and prothrombin time, and 24-hour urinary zinc excretion. We performed abdominal ultrasound and assessed clinical WM manifestations, drug compliance, and zinc side effects. The prescribed dose of zinc acetate for patients <= 5 years 25 mg twice daily; for these children aged 6 years and older, the dose was 25 mg three times a day. We increased the zinc dose if patients had AST/ALT > 50 U/L and decreased it if they had side effects of zinc such as iron deficiency anemia or pancytopenia. Results: At the time of diagnosis, AST/ALT and 24-hour urinary copper were 207+/-182/292+/-211 U/L and 143+/-68 cups/day (7.2+/-3, 5 cups/kg/day), respectively. All patients continued to take zinc with no evidence of zinc toxicity. None of our 7 patients became clinically symptomatic. AST/ALT decreased sharply to 35+/-7/37+/-16 U/L 1 year after treatment and was mostly maintained below 50 U/L for the remainder of the study (AST/ALT: 35+/-9 / 42+/-29 and 33+/-9/41+/-17 U/L 2 and 6 years after treatment, respectively). 24-hour urinary copper levels decreased to 54+/-18 cups/day (2.3+/-0.6 cups/kg/day) 1 year after treatment and remained mostly between 1 and 3 cups for the remainder /kg/day maintained throughout the study (1.7 +/- 0.7 and 1.9 +/- 0.9 µg/kg/day 2 and 6 years after treatment, respectively). Conclusions: Long-term zinc monotherapy for young pediatric patients with presymptomatic WM has been shown to be highly effective and safe. A reasonable goal in treating young children with WD with zinc appears to be to keep both AST/ALT below 50 U/L and 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day.",,"Eda, K.;Iwama, I.;Takeuchi, T.;Takaki, Y.;Mizuochi, T.",2015,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hep.28235,0,0,

Excess copper-derived oxidants contribute to liver disease progression in Wilson's disease. Oxidative stress induces the accumulation of abnormal proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a subcellular organelle that plays the role of proper protein folding. Accumulation of misfolded proteins disrupts ER homeostasis, leading to ER stress. Zinc acetate has been widely used to treat Wilson's disease because it increases the production of metallothionein and inhibits the absorption of copper in the intestinal epithelium. The effects of chemical chaperones and zinc acetate on copper-induced hepatotoxicity have not been studied. In this study, we examined the effects of chemical chaperone and zinc acetate on copper-induced disruption of cell homeostasis. [Methods] We used a human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) and an immortalized human hepatocyte cell line (OUMS29). The following materials were used: copper sulfate; acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal and epoxomicin as proteasome inhibitors (PIs); bathocuproine disulfonate as a copper chelator; n-acetyl-1-cysteine; zinc acetate; 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) as chemical chaperones. We detected the reactive oxygen species using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein. We analyzed copper-induced ER stress by immunoblotting for ER stress markers including the phospho-alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 and X-box binding protein 1. Hepatocyte apoptosis treated with copper with or without PI was characterized by detection of cleaved poly- ADP-ribose polymerase and cleaved caspase 3 by immunoblotting analysis and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. In addition, we examined cell proliferation on excess copper by immunofluorescence staining with Ki67. [Results] Excess copper-induced oxidative stress and ER stress. Chemical chaperones and zinc acetate reduced copper-induced oxidative stress and ER stress. Concomitant treatment of copper and PI exacerbated copper-induced apoptosis. Although excess copper led to a reduction in cell proliferation, chemical chaperones rescued the blockade of proliferation in copper-treated cells. However, zinc acetate did not exert this effect. [Conclusions] Excess copper induced hepatotoxicity. Chemical chaperones, PBA and UDCA and zinc acetate reduced hepatotoxicity. These results suggest that chemical chaperones may have beneficial effects for the treatment of Wilson's disease. On the other hand, zinc acetate used to treat Wilson disease can inhibit liver damage directly.",,"Oe, S.;Miyagawa, K.;Honma, Y.;Harada, M.",2015,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hep.28214,0,0,
1342,Is serum copper concentration related to implantation?,"OBJECTIVE: Contraceptives containing copper have been hypothesized to cause deposition of copper ions in the endometrium, leading to implantation failure. Similarly, patients with untreated Wilson's disease usually presented with subfertility and/or early pregnancy loss. Such zinc-treated patients successfully gave birth to babies. These observations lead to the hypothesis that infertile patients with high serum copper concentrations can cause implantation failure. This study aims to investigate whether serum copper concentration is related to the pregnancy rate of human embryos in vivo. DESIGN: Retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 408 patients with a mean age of 34.2 years who underwent freeze-thaw embryo transfer between December 2014 and March 2015 using the same hormone replacement cycle protocol (with estradiol > 140 pg/mL, progesterone > 10 ng/mL am day of transfer) with good blastocysts (3BB or greater by Gardner classification) were included in the study. Pregnancy test (serum hCG), serum copper, zinc and ceruloplasmin concentrations were measured 16 days after the first date of progesterone substitution. One hundred women who were pregnant without a miscarriage at 10 weeks' gestation (group P) and 176 women who were not pregnant (group NP) were compared. Student's t-test was used to compare between two groups. The cutoff line was determined by the receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) curve and the chi-square test was used for the 2x2 contingency table. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05. RESULTS: Age was not different between the two groups. The copper concentration of group NP (mean 192.3 mg/dl) was significantly higher than that of group P (mean 179.7 mg/dl), and the zinc concentration of group NP (mean 75.5 mg/dl) was significantly lower than that of group P (mean 90.3 mg/dl). All patients had normal ceruloplasmin levels (mean 39.4 mg/dl), denying Wilson's disease. According to the ROC curve of copper concentration and pregnancy outcome, the negative/positive cut-off was set at 159/160 (P=0.004 by chi-square test). At this cut-off point, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.88, 0.26, 0.68, and 0.54, respectively. Copper concentration was not associated with age, estradiol, progesterone, or hCG. CONCLUSIONS: High serum copper levels may be an independent risk factor for implantation failure. A prospective study is necessary to uncover causal relationships.",,"Matsubayashi, H.;Kitaya, K.;Yamaguchi, K.;Nishiyama, R.;Takaya, Y.;Ishikawa, T.",2015,September,,0,0,
1343,Fatal copper toxicity despite early aggressive interventions,"Background: Copper sulphate (CuSO4) is highly toxic in doses of 0.15-0.3 g/kg with subsequent hemolysis and multi-organ failure. There is no consensus on the optimal means of enhanced elimination for severe copper (Cu) toxicity. Case Report: A 19-year-old woman ingested >10 g CuSO4 solution obtained from her mother, who was a chemist. She had stomach pains and vomited blue. Physical examination revealed hypersalivation and tachycardia. She was intubated due to hypoxia and aspiration. Early bronchoscopy revealed tracheobronchitis and segmental blue-green discoloration of the bronchi, which was lavaged for decontamination. Endoscopy revealed grade 2 esophagitis, gastritis, duodenitis, and ulceration. By late hospital day 1, she developed significant hemolysis, methemoglobinemia, and anuric renal failure. Due to a nationwide shortage of calcium disodium edetate and dimercaprol, she was started on 1.5 g penicillamine. Trientine was not available. She was treated with hemodialysis (HD), exchange transfusions, methylene blue, zinc, and folic acid. Blood drawn in the ER, taken on Day 3 of the hospital, showed a serum copper level of >500 µg/dL. Cu was not detectable in the dialysate after two HD cycles. Her renal function did not improve and her neurological status deteriorated despite reduced serum Cu levels. After 14 days, her family withdrew from treatment due to her clinical condition not improving. An autopsy was not performed. Discussion: Our patient showed severe toxicity after a large ingestion of CuSO4. Bronchial lavage provided some decontamination. HD was initiated to attenuate direct Cu and penicillamine-induced nephrotoxicity and to support renal function. No penicillamine-bound Cu was found in the dialysate. Blood product replacement and exchange transfusions may have contributed to the reduction in Cu exposure. The serum Cu had doubled on day 8 compared to day 3, which could represent a redistribution. Conclusions: Acute Cu toxicity is rare but associated with high mortality due to severe hemolysis and multiorgan toxicity. Penicillamine is the standard of care for chronic Cu toxicity in Wilson's disease. There is no evidence for an optimal chelating agent for acute toxicity, but edetate calcium disodium and dimercaprol have been used successfully. In our case, the patient died despite decontamination measures, early multi-organ support, chelation and attempts at increased elimination.",,"Eisnor, D.;Anwar, M.;Morgan, B.;Pomerleau, A.",2015,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/15563650.2015.1071025,0,0,
1344,MEDNIK syndrome: clinical and biochemical characterization of response to long-term zinc therapy - a case report,"Background: MEDNIK syndrome—acronym for Intellectual Disability, Enteropathy, Deafness, Neuropathy, Ichthyosis, Keratoderma—is caused by mutations in the AP1S1 gene, which encodes the sigma 1A subunit of adapter protein complex 1 (AP-1). AP-1 directs the intracellular transport of several transmembrane proteins, including the copper-transporting ATPases ATP7A and ATP7B. We recently identified impaired copper metabolism in MEDNIK syndrome, a picture combining abnormalities of both Menkes and Wilson diseases and partially improved by zinc acetate therapy. Methods: To confirm our previous observation, we performed clinical and biochemical screening in an Italian patient with MEDNIK syndrome on zinc therapy. The duration of treatment was 4 years. Results: Our patient presented at diagnosis with hepatopathy, hypocuperemia, hypoceruloplasminemia, increased urinary copper excretion, hepatic copper overload, and intrahepatic cholestasis. At the end of the follow-up, she showed a marked improvement in hepatopathy and enteropathy with complete normalization of serum transaminases and liver copper content. However, the skin abnormalities worsened during follow-up and she showed stagnation in cognitive development. Conclusions: The above results raise new questions about the clinical and biochemical implications of AP-1 dysfunction and possible therapeutic options. Chronic zinc acetate may protect affected patients from liver copper overload, but some copper may be required for normal brain growth and maturation.",,"Martinelli, D.;Dionisi-Vici, C.",2015,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10545-015-9877-x,0,0,
1345,Wilson disease. Further evidence of phenotypic heterogeneity in two sisters,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene at 13q14.3. Defective protein leads to low ceruloplasmin blood levels and copper accumulation in liver, basal ganglia and cornea with clinical signs of liver disease, tremor, dysarthria, dystonia and psychiatric symptoms. Hemolytic anemia, hypertransaminasemia, renal tubular acidosis are other common findings. We report a series of 21 patients aged 8 to 52 years with long follow-up on treatment with penicillamine, zinc, or both. A striking phenotypic variability was observed in two sisters carrying the same genotype (c.3207C->A(p.H1069Q) / c.3904-2A->G). Although first signs appeared at 10 years of age in both, in the first the onset was marked by neurological signs (tremors, motor incoordination, speech and cognitive impairment), while in the other liver involvement was the only sign. After 20 years of follow-up, the former is severely affected (MRI evidence of basal ganglia copper deposits and hyperchogenic liver, piastropenia), while the latter still shows moderate liver enlargement. This phenotypic variability could be explained by the intervention of modifier genes (CTR1, ATOX1, MURR1) that regulate copper metabolism in the presence of defective ATP7B protein function. Further research into their role could also have profound implications for therapy.",,"Fiumara, A.;Sapuppo, A.;Brafa Musicoro, V.;Lepori, M.

1346,Hand stereotypes in Wilson's disease,"Aim: We present a case study of a young patient diagnosed with Wilson's disease (WD) who presents with stereotypies in both hands. Background: Stereotypies are a phenomenological category of hyperkinetic movement disorders. The exact definition of stereotypy varies with different authors. It is described as a coordinated, patterned, repetitive, rhythmic, purposeless, but apparently purposeful or ritualistic movement, posture, or utterance (Jankovic 1994). In an attempt to distinguish stereotypy from tics and other repetitive movement disorders, described as ""a non-purposeful movement pattern that is repeated continuously over a period of time in the same form and on multiple occasions, and that is typically distractible"". (Edwards et al. 2013). Wilson's disease is a disorder of copper metabolism with excessive accumulation of copper in the basal ganglia. Hyperactive movement disorders seen in WD include dystonia (often evident in the face, jaw, neck, trunk, and limbs), tremor - postural, action-induced, intentional resting tremor or swinging involvement of the proximal upper extremity (wing beating tremor). Yorio et al. (1994) described toe stereotypy in both feet in a patient with WD. Methods: This is a case study. Results: A 26-year-old right-handed woman presents with an approximately 3-month history of loss of function with information processing retardation and dysarthric speech. On examination she had aimless flexion-extension movements of all fingers of both hands. They were involuntary, patterned, repetitive, and rhythmic. The movements improved slightly with distraction. Occasional dystonic movements of the lips and jaw were present. The neurological examination was otherwise unremarkable. Kayser-Fleisher rings were evident on slit lamp examination. Brain MRI showed T2 hyperintensity in the bilateral striatum. Laboratory tests showed very low ceruloplasmin, high copper levels, and abnormal liver function, confirming WD and initiated on trientine. Conclusions: We believe this to be the first formal description of hand stereotypy in Wilson's disease. It is important and challenging to distinguish stereotypes of tremor, myoclonus, tics, dystonia, chorea, and athetosis. A videotape showing the patient's movements will be presented at the conference.",,"Mittal, S. O.;Ranpura, A.;Salardini, A.;Jabbari, B.",2015,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.26295,0,0,
1347,Bone turnover and its connection to penicillamine use in Chinese patients with Wilson's disease,"Objective: The prevalence of osteoporosis in patients with Wilson's disease (WD) is higher than in the general population, the cause of which is still unclear. The aim of this research is to analyze the possible causes of the high prevalence and the association between penicillamine and bone mineral density. METHODS: Eighty-four WM patients (44 males and 40 females) and 76 controls (27 males and 49 females) were included in this study. Patients were diagnosed by mutational analysis of ATP7B. Dual-energy X-ray analysis (DXA) was used to assess bone mineral density (BMD). Serum phosphate, calcium, magnesium, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, osteocalcin, 25-(OH)-vitamin D, and alkaline phosphatase were measured to assess bone turnover activity. Based on the imaging, laboratory test, and history information, we analyzed the correlations between BMD, bone turnover activity and patients' age, gender, clinical manifestations, and maximum penicillamine dosage. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients received a DXA scan. The prevalence of osteoporosis in WM patients was 27.58% (16/58) while that in controls was 19.74% (15/76). Lumbar vertebrae BMD, T-score and Z-score and hip neck BMD, Z-score were significantly lower in WM patients. 25(OH)-vitamin D, serum phosphate, serum calcium and ALP were significantly higher in WM patients than controls. But in patients who received different maximum daily doses of penicillamine, a higher dose was associated with a lower BMD. Age, gender and clinical manifestations did not affect BMD in WM patients. Conclusion: WM patients have a higher prevalence of osteoporosis, lower BMD and higher bone turnover activity compared to controls. Penicillamine use is an important triggering factor.",,"Dong, Q.

1348,WTX101-201: Phase 2 Trial of Bis-Choline Tetrathiomolybdate in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Wilson's Disease,"Background and Objectives: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired hepatic copper excretion caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, leading to copper accumulation in various organs including the liver and brain. WTX101 (Bischolintetrathiomolybdate) is a novel decopper agent with a unique mechanism of action (MoA) under development for the treatment of WD. WTX101 targets improved control of Cu due to rapid formation of irreversible Cu-tetrathiomolybdate-protein complexes leading to rapid decoppering without mobilizing free Cu that could cause tissue toxicity, including neurological deterioration. Tetrathiomolybdate has been studied in several clinical trials in WM patients using ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. The study will evaluate whether individualized oral BID dosing of WTX101 with a up-titration design in the initial decoppering phase is safe and effective to lower free copper (NCC, adjusted for plasma Mo concentration) levels and to maintain these lowered free copper levels Levels with QD dosage. It will also provide data on additional endpoints of free copper, 24-hour urinary copper and neurological outcomes using the UWDRS. Methods: This is an open-label, uncontrolled, 24-week phase 2 study conducted in the EU and the US. An individualized WTX101 dosing regimen is administered with PPIs in newly diagnosed symptomatic (neurological, stable hepatic, or combined) WM patients 18 years and older with elevated NCC who have been treated with chelation or zinc therapy for <= 28 days. Eligible subjects will receive WTX101 on an outpatient basis at doses of 30-300 mg per day along with omeprazole 20 mg per day. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving normalized NCC levels (<=2.3 muM) or at least a 25% reduction in NCC. Secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability, change and time to normalization in NCC levels, copper endpoints (exchangeable copper, profiling of tripartite Mo/Cu/protein complex species and 24-hour urinary copper), liver status with ALT , AST, INR and bilirubin measurement, neurological assessment (UWDRS), psychiatric assessment (MINI Tracking), clinical symptom status (CGI) and QOL/PRO endpoints (EQ5D, MMAS-8, TSQM). The PK of WTX101 is measured by total and free elemental Mo in plasma. Conclusions: The unique mode of action suggests that WTX101 could be an effective treatment option for WM patients with a lower potential for neurological deterioration, while once-daily dosing improves compliance.",,"Weiss, K.

1349,Functional characterization and drug response to zinc and D-penicillamine of disease-causing ATP7B mutations in a human hepatoma cell line,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In Wilson disease (WD), hepatocyte survival is significantly affected by toxic copper (Cu) overload due to mutation of the liver copper transporter ATP7B. More than 600 mutations of ATP7B have been described. Copper toxicity in WD is usually reversed by D-penicillamine (DPA) and/or zinc (Zn). The impact of the individual ATP7B mutation expressed in WM patients on the efficacy of standard of care is unknown. Methods: ATP7B mutations common in Europe/USA and Asia as well as various common homozygous genotypes observed in India were selected. Stable cell lines have been established expressing the mutations in a human hepatoma HepG2 ATP7B knockout cell line recently established by our group (PLoS ONE, 9:e98809, 2014). Cell survival and induction of apoptosis was determined in mutant cell lines after Cu exposure and Zn/DPA treatment. Results: In the mutant cell lines, ATP7B protein expression varied, while mRNA expression was at similar levels compared to wild-type. Colocalization studies using late endosome-lysosome marker lamps2 indicated an impairment of transport in various mutant cell lines. Mutant cell lines showed varying levels of activity to escape toxic Cu, with the p.H1069Q mutation showing moderate activity. No activity was observed in mutant cell lines encoding incomplete reading frames. After the combined treatment with Zn, DPA and Zn+DPA, characteristic responses to the treatment were observed for individual cell lines. Overall, DPA treatment was more efficient compared to Zn treatment. Of note, only Zn + DPA treatment was able to fully restore ATP7B activity compared to ATP7B wild-type. Conclusions: Individual ATP7B mutations differ in their ability to escape toxic Cu and show a genotype-specific response to treatment. The nature of the ATP7B mutation may modulate the efficacy of Zn and DPA treatment, suggesting that current treatment regimens could be further improved using knowledge of the functional parameters exerted by ATP7B.",,"Chandhok, G.;Sauer, V.;Niemietz, C.;Zibert, A.;Schmidt, H.

1350,Copper-Wilson disease,"Wilson's disease was described by Kinnier Wilson over a hundred years ago. He focused on neurological aspects of the disease, but also critically noted that the liver was affected. He postulated that one toxic agent was responsible for both neurological and liver damage. All we know is that the toxin is copper and that it accumulates in tissues at toxic levels due to a defect in a specific gene, ATP7B, which is critical for copper transport and metabolism in the liver. Injury to other organs, mainly the brain, is secondary to copper overload in the liver and elevated blood copper levels. Both the hepatic and neurological symptoms of the disease are highly variable, ranging from mild development over years to rapid progression leading to severe disability and death. Diagnosis is crucial for WM patients. It is based on a combination of clinical features, copper metabolism studies, genetic analysis and neuroimaging. Anticopper therapy is based on either copper chelation (d-penicillamine, trientine) or inhibition of copper absorption from the gut (zinc salts). Both types of therapy appear to be equally effective, and the choice depends on center experience, patient preference, and drug availability. A liver transplant is only performed in the case of fulminant liver damage and progression of liver failure despite therapy. Anticopper therapy must be lifelong. Pharmacotherapy results in clinical improvement in the majority of end-stage cases that go undiagnosed. It is important to screen asymptomatic siblings and children of affected patients. Early therapy prevents the development of symptoms. Patient compliance is crucial to the success of the therapy.",,"Czlonkowska, A.",2015,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.12813,0,0,
1351,Diagnostic value of 24-hour urinary copper excretion after 48-hour discontinuation of D-penicillamine in the compliance assessment in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Treatment with anticopper agents is effective in most cases. However, compliance is essential. The copper excretion in the urine is an important parameter for diagnosis and therapy monitoring. During long-term treatment with chelating agents, a two-day interruption of treatment should result in normal urinary copper concentrations (< 50 mg/dl). The aim of this study was to establish the usefulness of this method in compliance assessments in these patients. METHODS: We studied consecutive patients treated with D-penicillamine (DPA) for at least one year who underwent routine follow-up studies at our center. We assessed parameters of copper metabolism, neurological examinations, liver status and compliance. We performed a 24-hour analysis of urinary copper excretion 48 hours after discontinuation of chelation therapy. Results: 33 patients were included. The mean duration of treatment was 11.78 +/- 11.75 years. After 48 hours of DPA withdrawal, normalization (< 50 mg/24 h) of copper excretion was observed in 20 (87%) of 23 compliant patients. Ten patients were noncompliant and copper excretion was greater than 50 mg/24 h in 7 (70%) of them after termination of DPA. The specificity and sensitivity of this test were 87% and 70%, respectively. Receiver-operator curve analysis revealed an optimal cut-off for urinary copper excretion of 62 mg/dL for compliant patients. Conclusion: Measurement of 24-hour urinary copper excretion after a 48-hour interruption of DPA therapy in patients with WM is a reliable method to confirm patient compliance and may guide further treatment decisions.",,"Dziezyc, K.;Litwin, T.;Chabik, G.;Czlonkowska, A.",2015,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.12807,0,0,
1352,Early neurological deterioration in patients with Wilson's disease,"Aim: The aim of our study was to analyze the incidence of early neurological deterioration in WM patients, its outcome, and clinical and laboratory factors that may affect it. Background: Early neurological deterioration at the beginning of the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD) is still an unsolved therapeutic problem. METHODS: We analyzed 143 symptomatic WM patients diagnosed between 2005 and 2010. The early neurological deterioration group was based on deterioration on the Unified Wilson's Disease Score Scale (UWDRS) assessed at baseline through 6 months or the onset of new neurological symptoms. Reversibility of deterioration was followed up to 24 months. In addition, analysis was performed in subgroups with and without neurological deterioration according to selected clinical and laboratory variables and the type of anticopper therapy. Results: Early neurological deterioration in 11.1 [percent] (16/143) of WM patients, only in patients with neurological symptoms at the time of diagnosis. The mean time of worsening from the start of WM treatment was 2.3 +/- 1.9 months. Neurologic deterioration was fully reversible in 53 percent (8/15) and partially in 13 percent (2/15) patients over 9.2 +/- 5.2 months. Gender, age at diagnosis, disease duration, type of WM treatment (dpenicillamine or zinc sulfate), type of neurological manifestations, initial copper metabolism results, and liver function parameters had no impact on early neurological deterioration. Baseline neurological symptoms (15/69 vs. 0/73; p<0.01); progression of neurological deficits assessed in UWDRS Parts II and III (p<0.01); the occurrence of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes due to WD in the thalamus (p<0.01) and brainstem (p<0.01); concomitant treatment with drugs that may modulate the action of dopamine (p<0.05) were the most important predictors of early neurological deterioration in WM patients. Conclusions: Neurological deterioration at the start of anticopper therapy in WM patients occurs in patients with severe initial neurological manifestations, advanced brain damage and can also be provoked by the concomitant therapy, but is not associated with the type of anticopper therapy.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Litwin, T.;Karlinski, M.;Dziezyc, K.",2015,,,0,1,
1353,Zinc therapy reverses neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease patients,"Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of zinc therapy in reversing parkinsonism in patients with Wilson's disease initially treated with penicillamine. Background: For years, the treatment of Wilson's disease has aimed to stimulate the excretion of enriched copper by chelating agents. The dilemma arises when patients paradoxically worsen, which is due to chelating agents increasing free copper levels. Conversely, zinc therapy normalizes the elevated serum and urinary free copper by inducing the production of metallothionein. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study of four patients with severe Parkinson's disease who were initially treated with penicillamine with or without zinc, we compared subjective and objective clinical improvement before and one year after switching to zinc monotherapy. The Global Assessment Scale (GAS) was used for clinical assessments. Global disability was measured in four domains: liver, cognition and behavior, motor and osseomusculature, and neurological dysfunction was assessed in 14 major categories. Results: Three of the four patients who had deteriorated on penicillamine (0.5-1 g/d) improved significantly to normal biochemical and clinical status on zinc (150 mg/d). In the fourth patient on penicillamine 250 mg/day plus zinc 200 mg/day, the situation of the lower extremities improved slightly after one month, while in the following months she improved significantly with zinc monotherapy to a symptom-free state. Her general disability improved by about 73% and neurological exams showed an improvement of 100%. Conclusions: The results suggest zinc monotherapy as a safe and promising treatment for copper poisoning and support the normalization of elevated serum and urine copper levels as a rational therapeutic strategy.",,"Avan, A.;Azarpazhooh, M.

1354,Successful initial zinc therapy in Wilson's disease with acute liver failure and copper poisoning: a miracle cure exists,"Aims: To evaluate initial zinc monotherapy for copper levels and hepatic improvement. Background: The accumulation of copper in the brain and liver is considered to be the cause of Wilson's disease. However, there is evidence that the high of free copper is the origin. Methods: Retrospectively, a 10-year-old girl with Wilson's disease with diffuse jaundice, acute liver failure, hemolytic anemia, and high levels of copper, liver function, and urinary copper with a positive family history was examined before and after initial zinc monotherapy. The patient was treated with elemental zinc 125 mg per day and liver transplantation was considered in case of non-response. Results: The patient improved biochemically and clinically within 10 days of zinc therapy, which corresponded to an 86% decrease in urinary copper. The revised prognostic index for Wilson's disease improved from 13 to 5 and the patient was removed from the transplant list. After 2, 4, 8 weeks of zinc therapy, AST, ALT, bilirubin, urine copper showed constant improvements of up to 62, -26, 82, 77% up to the eighth week, respectively. The results for the second 8 week period showed a further decrease of 25, 41, 48, 86 and 33% for serum free copper compared to the previous results. No side effects or clinical deterioration were observed. Conclusions: The results suggest that zinc therapy is a promising, fast-acting, safe, and affordable choice for the treatment of copper toxicity in Wilson's disease with acute liver failure. It also supports the hypothesis of normalization of elevated serum free copper as a rational targeted therapeutic strategy.",,"Avan, A.;Kianifar, H. R.;Hoogenraad, T.

1355,Efficacy of copper chelation of D-penicillamine nanoparticles in the experimental rat model of copper toxicosis in non-Wilsonian brain,"Objective: D-penicillamine is unable to alleviate brain copper overload and neurological manifestations in patients with Alzheimer's/Wilson's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered D-penicillamine-loaded nanoparticles compared to conventional D-penicillamine over 90 days in the Wistar rat model of non-Wilsonian brain copper toxicosis. Methods: High-performance liquid chromatography, atomic absorption spectrophotometry, neurobehavioral and histopathological studies, and nanoparticle preparation/physicochemical characterization were performed. Results: D-penicillamine nanoparticles showed a mean size of 274.09 nm and less than 29.32% D-penicillamine release under in vitro conditions. Pharmacokinetic studies showed increased brain levels of D-penicillamine in the nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine administration group compared to the conventional D-penicillamine administration group. Conventional and nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy resulted in significantly improved neuromuscular coordination and memory along with a concomitant increase in urinary copper levels and acetylcholinesterase activity in the rat model of copper toxicosis. Conventional D-penicillamine therapy resulted in negative rhodanine staining of liver and brain sections, confirmed by 60.1%, and a 16.4% reduction in copper content in liver and brain, each compared to not treated copper-poisoned group. However, liver and brain sections of the nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy group showed grade 1 copper deposits and no copper deposits, as indicated by a 47.2% and 32.8% reduction in copper levels in the liver and brain, respectively, compared to the untreated copper-poisoned group was occupied. Conclusions: Taken together, the present study provides the first in vivo evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy in chelating more brain copper and alleviating neurological deficits, even at half the dose than one conventional D-penicillamine therapy.",,"Pal, A.;Vasishta, R.

1356,Successful liver transplantation for Wilson's disease as a rare cause of liver failure after SCT in a child with Fanconi aplastic anemia,"Introduction: Liver toxicity after allogeneic stem cell transplantation can have various causes, e.g. However, other rare causes should be considered. We present a child who develops liver failure after allo-SCT and is then diagnosed with Wilson's disease. The patient was successfully treated with repeated plasmapheresis for acute liver failure and subsequently transplanted with a cadaveric liver. Materials (or patients) and methods: A 13-year-old male patient was diagnosed with aplastic Fanconi anemia and underwent stem cell transplantation from an HLA-complete match sister. The reduced conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide. Liver enzymes and bilirubin levels were moderately elevated after transplantation. Hepatitis markers were negative. We thought the hepatic toxicity was due to the conditioning regimen. Stomach acid has not developed. The total bilirubin level was 10-15 mg/dl in the first three months and remained approximately stable. Direct bilirubin levels began to rise in the patient's fourth month, coagulation tests became abnormal. A percutaneous liver biopsy was taken. Toxic hepatitis was considered in the preliminary biopsy report. All medications, including cyclosporine A, were discontinued except trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Bilirubin levels increased during this time. Total bilirubin was 35.7 mg/dl and direct bilirubin 26.7 mg/dl, ammonia 194.6 mcg/dl and ceruloplasmin 47.1 mg/dl. The patients were assumed to fall into a hepatic coma and started receiving therapeutic plasmapheresis. A total of seven plasmapheresis procedures were performed. The first five plasmapheresis were performed with fresh frozen plasma. Allergic reactions occurred during the last plasmapheresis. One week later, two plasmapheresis with albumin were performed. Results: Liver biopsy was reported as toxic hepatitis and copper accumulation. The copper level in the 24-hour urine was high. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. D-penicillamine and zinc therapy was started. A cadaveric liver transplant was performed one month later. Two years after stem cell transplantation, the patient is disease-free, with complete donor bone marrow chimerism and stable liver graft function with immunosuppressive therapy. Conclusion: Consequently, in case of liver toxicity after allo-SCT, Wilson's disease should be considered. The patients with autosomal recessive diseases such as Fanconi aplastic anemia may have another autosomal recessive disease. For this reason, a detailed family history should be taken.",,"Albayrak, C.;Albayrak, D.;Kalayci, A. G.;Bicakci, A.;Elli, M.",2015,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/bmt.2015.37,0,0,
1357,Molecular Genetic Diagnosis of PFIC 3 Overlapping Presentation with Wilson's Disease and Treatment Response,"Case: The patient presented at age 15 with fatigue and findings of splenomegaly and mild thrombocytopenia. Additional tests included 24-hour urine copper [>100 mcg], no Kayser-Fleischer rings, normal ceruloplasmin levels, and no mutations of ATP7B. Liver biopsy showed chronic hepatitis, focal bridging fibrosis, moderate bile duct proliferation, and markedly elevated hepatic copper (1471 µg/g), suggestive of WD. She started zinc therapy but was switched to trientine because of gastrointestinal side effects. Despite being treated with trientine for > 12 months, her transaminase levels did not improve and urinary copper remained elevated. Further investigation for another possible etiology revealed elevated bile acids. A study with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was initiated for PFIC3. ABCB4 gene sequencing revealed a heterozygous c.984T > G (p.Y328*) mutation consistent with a diagnosis of PFIC3. Trientine was canceled and she continued on UDCA. With UDCA treatment, transaminases decreased but did not return to normal (table). The liver biopsy was repeated after 4 months of therapy and showed that the hepatic copper content decreased dramatically to 135 µg/g liver dry weight. After 10 months, liver indices remained slightly abnormal but synthetic function was stable. Conclusions: Hepatic copper accumulation can be observed in cholestatic diseases such as PFIC3 at values above the diagnostic threshold for WD, and therefore the diagnosis of PFIC3 should be considered in patients with elevated hepatic copper without clear features of WD and who do not respond adequately Treatment. UDCA improves cholestasis in PFIC3 and we show for the first time a reduction in hepatic copper in response to treatment.",,"Boga, S.;Jain, D.;Schilsky, M.",2015,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12072-015-9609-1,0,0,
1358,Colitis during trientine therapy in Wilson's disease a case report,"Case: A 40-year-old female patient with recently diagnosed Wilson's disease (WD) with predominant neuropsychiatric symptoms was initiated on triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (trientine) 250 mg tid and developed bloody diarrhea. Trientine was discontinued and colonoscopy revealed active ileitis and severe colitis of undetermined nature. She was started on prednisone and had an acute worsening of her neuropsychiatric symptoms and was referred to us with a prior diagnosis of steroid psychosis. Zinc therapy was initiated for her WM and the prednisone was discontinued. Clinical signs of colitis improved and sigmoidoscopy showed resolution of her colitis. Trientine was reinstated due to persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms. She again developed multiple bloody stools, so trientine was discontinued. The assessment for other causes of colitis was negative for infections and markers for IBD. A repeat colonoscopy at this time revealed active colitis and proctitis. Histology showed extensive inflammation with cryptitis, crypt abscess formation, and ulceration, suggestive of drug-induced colitis. The patient was restarted on zinc therapy for her WD and had resolution of colitis symptoms with no recurrence. All of her neurological symptoms improved and disappeared over a period of time. She had stable liver function while on zinc maintenance therapy. Conclusion: Chelation therapy is an integral part of initial therapy for symptomatic patients with WM, but patients must be adequately monitored for adverse events. Colitis is a rare side effect of trientine and zinc is an alternative therapy for patients with WM with side effects from chelation therapy.",,"Boga, S.;Jain, D.;Schilsky, M.",2015,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12072-015-9609-1,0,0,
1359,Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation in an 8-month-old boy,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive copper deposition disorder that can cause fatal neurological and hepatic disorders if left undiagnosed and untreated. The youngest child with normal liver function reported to date is an 8-month-old Japanese boy with low ceruloplasmin levels. Regarding liver dysfunction, the youngest child ever reported is a 9-month-old Korean boy with elevated aminotransferases confirmed by genetic testing. We report an 8-month-old Chinese boy with elevated liver enzymes and low serum ceruloplasmin levels. Genetic analysis of the ATP7B gene detected two heterozygous mutations (c.3809A>G/p.A874 V and c.2621C>T/p.N1270S) reported to cause WD in the Wilson Disease Mutation Database. Parents were screened for disease-causing mutations. The father was heterozygous for the c.3809A>G/p.N1270S mutation and the mother was heterozygous for c.2621C>T/p.A874 V. Elevated serum aminotransferase in this child was refractory, but permanent normalization was associated with a achieved zinc therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the youngest patient with elevated liver enzymes ever reported anywhere in the world. We hope this will raise awareness among pediatricians, leading to earlier diagnosis, timely treatment and better clinical outcomes.",,"Abuduxikuer, K.;Wang, J.

1362,Simultaneous monitoring of cerebral metal accumulation in an experimental model of Wilson's disease by inductively coupled plasma laser ablation mass spectrometry,"Background: Neuropsychiatric disorders with extrapyramidal symptoms are a common component of Wilson's disease (WD). WD is caused by a genetic defect in the copper (Cu) efflux pump ATPase7B. Mouse strains with natural or engineered transgenic defects in the Atp7b gene served as a model for WD. These show a gradual accumulation and concentration of Cu in the liver, kidneys and brain. However, little is known about the regional distribution of Cu in the brain, its influence on other metals, and subsequent pathophysiological mechanisms. We applied inductively coupled plasma laser ablation mass spectrometry and performed comparative metal bio-imaging in brain sections of wild-type and ATP7b-null mice ranging in age from 11 to 24 months. Messenger RNA and protein expression of a number of inflammatory markers were assessed using RT-PCR and Western blots of brain homogenates. Results: We could confirm the copper accumulation in the brain parenchyma by a factor of two in WD (5.5 g<sup>-1</sup> in the cortex) compared to controls (2.7 g<sup>-1</sup>) , which was fully established by 11 months. In the periventricular regions (PVR) known as structures with a pronounced Cu content, Cu was again reduced by a factor of 3. This confirms the conception of the PVR as efflux compartments with active transport of Cu into the cerebrospinal fluid. In addition, the Cu gradient increasing downstream of the PVR was reduced. Otherwise, the architecture of the Cu distribution was essentially retained. Zinc (Zn) was increased by up to 40%, particularly in high Cu regions but not in typical Zn accumulator regions, a side effect due to the fact that Zn is to some extent a substrate of Cu ATPases. The concentrations of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) were constant in all regions examined. The inflammatory markers TNF-alpha, TIMP-1 and the capillary proliferation marker alpha-SMA were increased by a factor of 2-3 in WM. Conclusions: This study confirmed stable cerebral parenchymal Cu accumulation and detected reduced Cu in the cerebrospinal fluid in Atp7b-null mice, underscoring the diagnostic value of microlocal analysis techniques.

1363,Genotype-phenotype correlations in a mountain community with high prevalence of Wilson's disease: genetic and clinical homogeneity,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by more than 500 mutations in the ATP7B gene and shows considerable heterogeneity in clinical manifestations even in patients with a specific mutation. Previous results suggested a possible role of additional genetic modifiers and environmental factors in phenotypic expression in affected patients. We performed clinical and genetic studies to perform genotype-phenotype correlation in two large families living in a socioculturally isolated community with the highest ever reported prevalence of Wilson's disease of 1:1130. Sequencing of the ATP7B gene in seven affected individuals and 43 family members identified a common composite heterozygous genotype, H1069Q/M769H-fs, in five symptomatic and two asymptomatic patients and established the presence of two out of seven identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in all affected patients . Symptomatic patients had a similar clinical phenotype and age at onset (18 +/- 1 years) and presented dysarthria and dysphagia as common clinical features at the time of diagnosis. In addition, all symptomatic patients presented Kayser-Fleischer rings and the absence of dystonia accompanied by unfavorable clinical outcomes. Our results add value to the understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations in Wilson's disease based on a multifamily study in an isolated population with a high degree of genetic and environmental homogeneity in contrast to most reports. We observed an equal impact of putative other genetic modifiers and environmental factors on clinical presentation and age at onset of Wilson disease in patients with a given genotype. These data provide valuable inferences that could be used to predict clinical management in asymptomatic patients in such communities. © 2014 Cocos et al.",,"Cocos, R.;Sendroiu, A.;Schipor, S.;Bohiltea, L.

1364,Neurological manifestations of acute and chronic liver diseases,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article summarizes the most common neurological consequences of acute and chronic liver failure, liver transplantation, and other treatments for liver disease, and outlines the pathogenesis, neurological manifestations, and treatment of Wilson's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: The neurological manifestations of liver disease are caused by the liver's failure to detoxify agents that have deleterious effects on the central and peripheral nervous systems. In addition, treatments for liver disease such as liver transplantation, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and antiviral drugs can also be neurotoxic. Wilson's disease affects the liver and nervous system simultaneously and can often be diagnosed initially by a neurologist; Treatment options have evolved over the past few years. SUMMARY: Acute and chronic liver disease are common in the general population. Neurological dysfunction will eventually affect a significant number of these individuals, particularly if the disease progresses to liver failure. Early detection of these neurological manifestations can lead to more effective treatment of these patients.

1367,Long-term outcomes of liver transplantation in Wilson's disease: experience in France,"Background & Aims Liver transplantation (LT) is the therapeutic option for severe complications of Wilson's disease (WD). Our aim was to report the long-term outcome of WM patients after LT. Methods The medical records of 121 French patients transplanted for WM between 1985 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. 75 patients were adults (mean age: 29 years (18-66)) and 46 were children (mean age: 14 years (7-17)). The indication for LT was (1) fulminant/subfulminant hepatitis (n=64, 53%), mean age = 16 years (7-53), (2) decompensated cirrhosis (n=50, 41%), mean age = 31 .5 years (12-66) or (3) severe neurological disease (n = 7.6%), mean age = 21.5 years (14.5-42). Median post-transplant follow-up was 72 months (range 0-23.5). Results The actuarial survival rates of the patients were 87% after 5, 10 and 15 years. Male gender, renal insufficiency before transplantation, non-elective procedure and neurological indication were significantly associated with worse survival. None of these factors remained statistically significant in the multivariate analysis. In patients transplanted for hepatic indications, the prognosis was poorer in fulminant or subfulminant course, nonelective surgery, pretransplant renal failure, and in patients transplanted before the year 2000. At the last visit, the mean calculated glomerular filtration rate was 93 mL/min (33-180); 11/93 patients (12%) had stage II renal disease and none had stage III.

1369,Causing of Alzheimer's disease by copper toxicity and treatment with zinc,"Evidence is presented that the Alzheimer's disease (AD) epidemic is recent, as the disease was very rare in the 1900s. Incidence is increasing rapidly, but only in developed countries. We postulate that the emerging environmental factor partially causative of the AD epidemic is the ingestion of inorganic copper from drinking water and the intake of dietary supplements along with a high-fat diet. Inorganic copper can be partially absorbed directly and increases the serum-free copper pool. The Squitti group has shown that serum free copper is elevated in AD, correlates with cognition, and predicts cognition loss. Thus, our inorganic copper hypothesis fits well with the data from the Squitti group. We have also shown that AD patients are zinc deficient compared to age-matched controls. Since zinc is a neuronal protective factor, we postulate that zinc deficiency may also be partially responsible for AD. We conducted a small, 6-month, double-blind study of a new formulation of zinc and found that it protected against cognition loss in patients 70 and older. Zinc therapy also significantly reduced serum free copper in AD patients, so efficacy may be achieved by restoring normal zinc levels or lowering serum free copper, or both. © 2014 Brewers.",,"Brewer, G.

This study aimed to investigate the ultrasound backscatter properties of the myocardium in patients with Wilson's disease. bMaterials and methods: We compared cardiac asymptomatic Wilson's disease patients (W group) (n=18) with age-matched (26.7+/-9.6 years) healthy controls (C group) (n=15). The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made on the basis of clinical manifestations, family history, and laboratory findings, and was confirmed by liver biopsy. Transthoracic echocardiographic quantitative texture analysis was performed on data from the septum and left ventricular posterior wall, and mean gray level (MGL) histograms at end-diastole (d) and end-systolic (s) were obtained after background correction (c). The cyclic variation index (CVI) was calculated using the formula [(cMGLd - cMGLs) / cMGLd] x 100. bResults: There were no significant differences in gender, age, body mass index, heart rate or blood pressure, and conventional echocardiographic parameters between the two groups. The posterior wall cMGLs value was higher in the W group than in the C group (30.9 +/- 2.6 vs. 22.2 +/- 2.7, p = 0.033). The W group had a significantly lower septal CVI than the C group (-22 +/- 4.4% vs. 43.4 +/- 12.9%, p<0.001), and there was no significant difference in Posterior septal wall CVI (-67.0 +/- 15.9% vs. 41.7 +/- 18.6%, p=0.32). bConclusion: Anomalies in two-dimensional echocardiographic grayscale distributions were present in patients with Wilson's disease.

1374,"Osteoporosis and fractures in liver disease: relevance, pathogenesis, and therapeutic implications","There is increasing recognition that patients with liver disease develop bone loss that can be severe enough to result in atraumatic fractures, thereby significantly reducing quality of life and life expectancy. The estimated prevalence of liver-related osteoporosis is between 20-420/100,000 in the general population and fractures between 60-880/100,000. It should be borne in mind that up to 40% of patients with chronic liver disease may sustain a fracture. Pathogenic mediators include fibronectin, insulin-like growth factor-I, and various cytokines, but vitamin D depletion and/or corticosteroid treatment contribute to deterioration in bone health. Despite advances in bone biology that have shed some light on the pathogenesis of this bone loss, treatment options remain nonspecific and closely related to the treatment of other forms of osteoporosis. Therefore, treatment in all patients with chronic liver disease should include calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, particularly in patients receiving corticosteroids. This review focuses on the prevalence of this entity and the available evidence regarding the pathogenesis of bone loss in liver disease, the diagnostic steps required in all patients, and the available therapeutic options.

1375,Low-copper diet as a preventive strategy for Alzheimer's disease,"Copper is an essential element and either a copper deficiency or excess can be life threatening. Recent studies have shown that alteration of copper metabolism is one of the pathogenetic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given these results, many researchers have proposed preventive strategies to reduce AD risk. Since the general population comes into contact with copper mainly through food, i.e. 75% through food and 25% through drinking water, a low-copper diet can reduce the risk of AD in people with altered copper metabolism. We propose that an interplay between diet and genes underlies the ""copper phenotype"" of sporadic AD. Here we describe the pathways that regulate copper homeostasis, the adverse consequences associated with its disruptions, the pathogenic mechanism of the AD copper phenotype, indications for a copper-depleted diet, and future prospects for improving this prevention strategy. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,"Squitti, R.;Siotto, M.;Polimanti, R.",2014,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.02.031,0,0,

1379,Abnormal copper metabolism in Niemann-Pick type C disease mimicking Wilson disease,"Background: Niemann-Pick type C disease is a rare lysosomal storage disease affecting infants, adolescents and adults. Aim: We studied a family of two siblings who had adulthood with Niemann-Pick type C disease and presented with abnormal copper metabolism resembling Wilson disease. METHODS: Case 1 was a 26-year-old non-consanguineous Japanese male who was referred to the hospital's outpatient department for recent gait disturbances and mental deterioration that had developed since the age of 20 years. He was tentatively diagnosed as a heterozygous carrier of Wilson's disease because his brother (Case 2) was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. He presented with dementia, dysphagia, dystonia, ataxia, and down gaze palsy. Laboratory study showed mild hepatic dysfunction and moderate splenomegaly. Magnetic resonance images showed a thin corpus callosum and narrowed deep white matter. Case 2 35 years old and had developed psychiatric and motor symptoms since age 20. He had been treated for Wilson's disease for 11 years because of copper buildup in his liver and abnormal copper metabolism. Symptoms had gradually worsened over a year despite chelation therapy and tube feeding with gastrostomy. Molecular diagnostics for Niemann-Pick type C disease were performed. Results: Filipin staining in cultured dermal fibroblasts from case 1 was partially positive and genetic analysis showed that both siblings had composite heterozygosity for p.G992R in exon 20 and IVS6-3 C>G of NPC1. Administration of miglustat for 3 months partially improved their intellectual and motor dysfunction. Conclusion: The differential diagnosis between Niemann-Pick type C disease and Wilson's disease is important for targeted treatment.

DNA and RNA were extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes, amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested reverse transcription PCR (RT-nested PCR) to characterize the variant transcripts. RT-nested PCR product sequencing comparison showed that the c.3244-2ANC mutation at the splice site caused erroneous transcripts and formatted a newsplice acceptor. Patients with the c.3244-2ANC splice site mutation had an early age at onset, severe clinical manifestations and a poor prognosis. WD patients with the splice site mutation show severe clinical manifestations, suggesting that aberrant transcripts have important implications for the WD phenotype.

We report on a WM patient who developed unilateral wing beating tremor 6 years after OLT. In most cases, new neurological symptoms develop immediately after the OLT. In our patient, the extrapyramidal symptoms occurred with a prolonged interval after the OLT. To our knowledge, this is the first patient with delayed extrapyramidal symptoms after OLT in WD in which the pathophysiology of these late extrapyramidal symptoms is still unknown. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"Kim, J.

1383,Small fiber dysfunction in patients with Wilson's disease,"Aim: Patients with Wilson disease (WD) may develop a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, but there are few reports of autonomic dysfunction. Here we described evidence of small fiber and/or autonomic dysfunction in 4 patients with WD and levodopa-responsive parkinsonism. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 4 patients with WD who underwent evaluation for the presence of neuromuscular dysfunction and a water-induced skin-fold test (SWT). Results: Two men and two women (33+/-3.5 years) with WD were studied. They all suffered from Parkinson's at some point during the course of their illness. Patient 4's parkinsonism almost completely resolved with treatment of WD. Two patients had significant sensory and 2 significant autonomic complaints, including syncope. NCS/EMG was normal in all, but SWT was abnormal in half of them (mean 4-digit wrinkling of 0.25 and 1). Discussion: A subgroup of patients with WD show evidence of an abnormal skin fold test (small fiber neuropathy).",,"Gondim, F. A. A.;Araujo, D. F.;Oliveira, I. S.;do Vale, O.

1384,The copper chelator ATN-224 induces caspase-independent cell death in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,"Bcl-2 and other antiapoptotic proteins are associated with defective caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling pathways, resulting in chemoresistance. We have previously shown that ATN-224, a copper chelator drug, induces cell death in Bcl-2 transfected murine thymic lymphoma cells. In the current study, we tested whether ATN-224 is active in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells that have increased anti-apoptotic proteins through translocation or amplification. We found that nanomolar concentrations of ATN-224 induced cell death in DLBCL cells regardless of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 status. Treatment with ATN-224 resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction, release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and induction of caspase-independent cell death. In addition, ATN-224 degraded Mcl-1 and enhanced the effects of the BH3 mimic ABT-263. These results indicate that ATN-224 has potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of DLBCL. Induction of caspase-independent cell death in apoptosis-resistant DLBCL would represent a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of refractory disease.

Presentations with psychotic symptoms have been described less frequently. In this report we present the case of a young boy with Wilson's disease who developed psychotic symptoms. A 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with Wilson's disease based on physical examination findings and low levels of ceruloplasmin (8.1 mg/dl). Two weeks after being diagnosed with Wilson's disease, he developed an acute onset of illness characterized by paranoia, anxiety, increased alertness, and decreased sleep. These symptoms were not associated with confusion, depressed level of consciousness, hallucinations and mood symptoms. There was no past or family history of psychosis. A week after the onset of symptoms he was prescribed tablet penicillamine, initially 250 mg/day increasing to 500 mg/day after 3 days. After increasing the dose of penicillamine, his psychiatric symptoms worsened and led to his hospitalization. A diagnosis of organic delusional disorder (F06.2) due to Wilson's disease was considered. Tab risperidone 1 mg/day was started and the dose of penicillamine was reduced, causing the symptoms to disappear. Whenever a young adolescent develops psychosis, particularly of the delusional type, the possibility of Wilson's disease must be considered.",,"Grover, S.;Sarkar, S.;Jhanda, S.;Chawla, Y.",2014,2022-10-01 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/0019-5545.146530,0,0,

We report here the case of a 10-year-old female patient with fulminant WD (RWPI, 16) who fully recovered after plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration followed by treatment with copper chelates. To the best of our knowledge, there were five fulminant WM patients with RWPI >= 11, including the present patient, who did not undergo LTx. Based on the therapeutic modalities in these five cases, nonsurgical treatment (blood cleansing and copper chelating agents) may be able to avoid LTx in fulminant WD even with very high RWPI, although preparation for LTx is required. © 2014 Japan Pediatric Society.",,"Motobayashi, M.;Fukuyama, T.;Nakayama, Y.;Sano, K.;Noda, S.;Hidaka, Y.;Amano, Y.;Ikeda, S.

1390,Evidence for synergistic effects of PRNP and ATP7B mutations in severe neuropsychiatric deterioration,"Background: Wilson disease (WD), a rare cause of neuropsychiatric deterioration, is associated with mutations in the ATP7B gene. Prion diseases are also rare causes of neuropsychiatric deterioration that occur sporadically with no apparent cause or may be due to mutations in the PRNP gene. Case presentation: Here we describe a biological ""nature experiment"" in which a patient presented with severe neuropsychiatric deterioration and strong biochemical evidence of WM. Genetic analysis revealed that he was a composite heterozygous for two ATP7B sequence variants (c.2165dupT, p.Arg723Glufs*32; and c.4039G > A, p.Gly1347Ser), the first previously reported and the second newly was . In addition, the patient was heterozygous for a PRNP variant, c.160G > A, p.Gly54Ser, which has only been reported once in a neuropsychiatric patient in association with a similarly severe clinical course of neuropsychiatric disease and an early age of onset. but no accompanying information on ATP7B genotype. Of particular interest was the observation that the patient's older sister, who carried the same ATP7B genotype and laboratory evidence of biochemical WD but was clinically asymptomatic, lacked the PRNP variant allele. Conclusions: We propose that synergism may occur between at least some allelic variants of ATP7B and PRNP, possibly exerted through effects on cellular copper metabolism.

Conventional auxiliary liver transplantation for WD is orthotopic liver transplantation and heterotopic liver transplantation. But the conventional method could not avoid the problem of space, functional competition and hemodynamic variation. Here we report a case of heterotopic auxiliary living-donor liver transplantation (HALDLT) for the treatment of WM. We modified the surgery to perform a splenectomy and implant a graft in the fossa of the spleen. The patient recovered well after transplantation and was symptom-free during a 5-year follow-up. This modified operation is safer and easier.

1394,Chelating polymer beads as potential therapeutics for Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder caused by ATPase 7B dysfunction, which leads to high accumulation of copper in the organism and consequent toxic effects. We propose gentle therapy to eliminate excess copper by oral administration of insoluble, non-absorbable polymeric sorbents with selective copper(II) chelating groups. Polymer beads containing the chelating agents triethylenetetramine, N,N-di(2-pyridylmethyl)amine, and 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQB) were studied. In a preliminary copper uptake experiment, we found that 8HQB significantly reduced copper uptake (using copper-64 as a radiotracer) after oral administration in Wistar rats. In addition, we measured organ radioactivity in rats to show that 8HQB radiolabeled with iodine-125 is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Non-absorbability and blockade of copper uptake were also confirmed with small animal imaging (PET/CT) in mice. In a long-term experiment with Wistar rats fed a diet containing the polymers, we found that there was no evidence of polymer toxicity and the addition of polymers to the diet resulted in a significant reduction in copper levels in the kidneys, brains, and livers of rats. We have shown that polymers containing specific ligands could potentially be novel therapeutics for Wilson's disease. © 2014 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Mattova, J.;Pouckova, P.;Kucka, J.;Skodova, M.;Vetrik, M.;Stepanek, P.;Urbanek, P.;Petrik, M.;Novy, Z.;Hruby, M.",2014,2022-10-01 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejps.2014.05.002,0,0,

1398,Liver transplantation in neurological Wilson's disease: is there an indication? a case report,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper overload. In this disease, insufficient hepatic excretion leads to copper accumulation in the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea. Severe neurological symptoms can develop in patients with MD, often without relevant liver damage: it is unclear whether liver transplantation (LT) could reverse neurological symptoms, and currently LT is not recommended in this situation. We report a case of regression of neurological symptoms in a patient affected with WM with predominant neurological involvement. A 19-year-old man with disabling neuropsychiatric symptoms of WD, including frontal ataxia, akinesia, dystonia, tremor, and behavioral disturbances with preserved liver function (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score = 7; Child-Turcotte-Pugh score = A5) was Subjected to LT November 2009. At the time of LT, encephalic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse neurodegenerative changes that included subtentorial and supratentorial structures; Kayser Fleischer ring on both sides. Four years after LT, laboratory tests show normalized copper metabolism and excellent liver function test results. Encephalic MRI shows a clear improvement of already known signal changes at the nuclei thalamus and putamen, mesencephalon and pons. The Kayser-Fleischer ring on the right eye has disappeared, but a small remnant is still visible on the left eye. On neurological examination, all previous symptoms and signs are no longer present and behavioral disorders are no longer present; psychosocial functions are fully restored. The present case provides some evidence that LT may be a valid therapeutic option for WM patients with significant neurological impairment, particularly in patients who have become unresponsive to chelation therapy.

1399,Wilson's disease presenting as rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder: A potential window for early treatment,"Aim: To describe the features of REM sleep behavior disorder in Wilson's disease. Method: Questionnaire-based interviews (patients and relatives), neurological examinations, two-week prospective dream diary, video polysomnography, transcranial sonography, MRI. Results: Four cases of Wilson's disease with REM sleep behavior disorder have been described; three had REM sleep behavior disorder as their first symptom. All presented mesencephalic tegmental/tectal sonographic hyperechoicity and two presented ponto-mesencephalic tegmental MRI hyperintensity. Conclusion: This first literature description of REM sleep behavior disorder in Wilson's disease documents REM sleep behavior disorder as a possible symptom of Wilson's disease and adds further evidence for the parallelism of Parkinson's disease and Wilson's disease im phenotype and brainstem topography that should be further studied. The REM sleep behavior disorder has prognostic relevance for neurodegeneration in a-synucleinopathies. In Wilson's disease, the benefits of early diagnosis and treatment are well established. The REM sleep behavior disorder in Wilson's disease offers a possible theoretical model for a possible early treatment of this extrapyramidal and brainstem paradigm syndrome and gives an outlook on the possibility of a neuroprotective treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder in the ""preclinical"" Parkinson's Illness.

1400,Psychiatric signs and symptoms in treatable inborn errors of metabolism,"Possible underlying organic causes of psychiatric symptoms can be overlooked in the clinical setting. It is important to raise awareness among psychiatric and neurological professionals about certain inherited metabolic disorders, as in some cases disease-specific therapies are available that can, for example, treat underlying metabolic causes. The following article describes the basic pathophysiology, clinical and neurological features, and available diagnostic methods of six treatable metabolic disorders associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms: Wilson's disease, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, porphyrias, homocysteinemia, urea cycle disorders, and Niemann-Pick type C disease (NP- C). NP-C is considered a particularly relevant example as it has traditionally been viewed as a disease presenting with severe neurological and systemic manifestations in children, but an increasing number of patients are being discovered to have the form of adolescent or adult onset, often associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms. A significant proportion of adulthood cases have been reported in which NP-C has been misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disorder and treated, usually based on the patient's initial presentation of psychotic or schizophrenia-like symptoms. In patients with atypical symptoms and/or resistance to standard therapy, underlying organic causes of psychiatric disorders such as psychosis should be considered. In addition to improved framework conditions for additional multidisciplinary diagnostic work in patients with suspected organic disease, the development of convenient and affordable biochemical screening and/or diagnostic methods has enabled new ways to narrow down differential diagnoses. © 2014 The author(s).",,"Nia, S.",2014,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00415-014-7396-6,0,0,

1406,Copper Chelators: Chemical Properties and Biomedical Applications,"Copper is present in varying concentrations and chemical forms in the earth's crust, in surface and deep water, and even in trace amounts in the atmosphere itself. Copper is one of the first metals used by humans, with the first artifacts dating back 10,000 years. Currently, world production of refined copper exceeds 16,000 tons/year. Copper is an essential microelement, primarily for its red-ox properties, making it a necessary cofactor for many enzymes such as cytochrome c oxidase and superoxide dismutase. In some animal species (e.g. octopuses, snails, spiders, oysters) copper hemocyanins act as oxygen carriers instead of hemoglobin. However, these redox properties also make the Cu<sup>+</sup>/Cu<sup>2+</sup> couple an excellent catalyst for the formation of reactive oxygen species when copper is in excess in the body or in tissues. The treatment of choice for copper overload or poisoning is chelation therapy. Various molecules are already in clinical use as chelating agents or are being studied in studies or clinical trials. It is worth noting that chelation therapy has also been suggested to treat some neurodegenerative diseases or cardiovascular diseases. In this review, after a brief description of copper homeostasis and a few cases of dyshomeostasis, the main (used or potential) chelating agents are described; their properties in solution, even in relation to the presence of metal or ligand competitors, under physiological conditions are discussed. In addition, the legislation of the major western countries is outlined both on the use of chelating agents and on the limits for copper in food, drugs and cosmetics.

1407,Factors predicting mortality in children with Wilson disease associated with acute liver failure and comparison of prognostic indices specific to Wilson disease,"Background and Aims: Acute liver failure (ALF) associated with Wilson disease (WD) affects children more frequently than adults. The predictors of mortality and outcome in patients without encephalopathy are not clear. We examined the ability of prognostic factors and different models, including the end-stage liver disease (MELD) model, to predict mortality in children with WM and ALF. METHODS: We analyzed admission characteristics in 61 children < 18 years with WD and ALF. Factors associated with mortality in univariate Cox regression analysis were analyzed by stepwise forward Cox hazards regression. The prognostic models such as the Nazer model, the revised Kings College model and the Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease Score/End-Stage Liver Disease Model (PELD/MELD) were compared. Results: Of the 145 children < 18 years with WD, 61 had ALF, of whom 33 (54%) died, including 22/27 (81.5%) with encephalopathy and 11/34 (32.4%) without encephalopathy. The mean age of children with ALF was 9.7 years, 38 (62.3%) were boys. Prognostic factors significant for mortality included encephalopathy, international normalized ratio, total proteins, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, and white blood cell count. Stepwise forward Cox proportional hazards regression identified encephalopathy (hazard ratio 2.88; CI 1.1-7.4) and total bilirubin (hazard ratio 1.05; CI: 1.02-1.09) as predictors for the result. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of the Nazer index, King's College revised criteria, and PELD/MELD were 0.74, 0.76, and 0.75, respectively. Conclusions: Mortality in children with WD and ALF is 54%, 81.5% with encephalopathy and 32.4% without encephalopathy. The prognostic models MELD/PELD score, Nazer index and Kings College criteria are comparable with an AUC between 0.74-0.76.

A bone marrow biopsy performed to investigate the cause of the bicytopenia revealed trilineage dysplasia. In correlation of the clinical context with bone marrow and biochemical parameters, a copper deficiency was suspected and a therapy attempt was carried out, whereupon the hematological parameters improved. This case highlights hypocuremia as a reversible cause of bone marrow dysplasia in patients with chelated Wilson's disease where serum copper levels are unhelpful for diagnosis. We also believe that blood count monitoring in patients on copper chelation may give an indication of impending copper deficiency.

1409,Determination of serum metallothionein (MT)1/2 concentration in patients with Wilson's disease and Menkes' disease,"We have developed a simple and specific enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for the simultaneous determination of serum metallothinein-1 (MT-1) and 2 (MT-2) in both humans and experimental animals. A competitive ELISA was established using a specific polyclonal antibody against rat MT-2. The antibody used for this ELISA had shown the same cross-reactivity with MT in humans and experimental animals. The NH 2 -terminal peptide of MT containing acetylated methionine has been shown to be the epitope of this antibody. The reactivity of this ELISA system with liver, kidney and brain in MT1/2 knockout mice was significantly low but normal in an MT-3 knockout mouse. The lowest detection limit of this ELISA was 0.6 ng/ml and the spiked MT-1 was completely recovered from the plasma. We examined the normal range of MT1/2 (25-75% tile) in 200 healthy human sera and found this to be the case 27-48. ng/ml and compared to serum levels in various liver diseases. Serum MT1/2 levels in patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) were significantly lower than in healthy controls and also in other liver diseases. In the chronic hepatitis cases, MT1/I2 levels gradually increased, followed by disease progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In particular, we found significantly elevated MT1/2 plasma levels in patients with Wilson's disease, which were very similar to those in the Long-Evans cinnamon (LEC) rat (model animal of Wilson's disease). In addition, a significantly increased level of MT1/2 was found in patients with Menkes disease, an inherited disorder of copper metabolism such as Wilson's disease.

The Wilson disease protein, ATP7B, functions in copper excretion in the bile and in copper secretion into the bloodstream coupled with ceruloplasmin synthesis. Different types of mutations in ATP7B cause Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is a rare genetic condition that can be treated pharmacologically. Recognition and prompt diagnosis are very important because Wilson's disease is fatal if left untreated. In this review I summarize the pathogenesis and treatment of Wilson's disease.

1411,"Treatment with D-penicillamine or zinc sulfate affects copper metabolism and improves, but does not normalize, parameters of antioxidant capacity in Wilson's disease","Copper accumulation in tissues due to a biallelic pathogenic mutation of gene: ATP7B results in a clinical phenotype known as Wilson's disease (WD). Aberrations in copper homeostasis can create favorable conditions for superoxide-generating redox cycling and oxidative tissue damage. Drugs used in WD treatment are aimed at removing accumulated copper and normalizing the concentration of free copper in the blood. In the current study, the effect of decopper treatment on copper metabolism and parameters of systemic antioxidant capacity was analyzed. Treatment-naïve MV patients (TNWD) (n=33), anti-copper drug-treated (TWD) patients (n=99), and healthy controls (n=99) were studied. Both TNWD and TWD patients characterized by reduced parameters of copper metabolism compared to controls, as well as reduced total antioxidant potential (AOP), glutathione (GSH) levels, activity of catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and S-transferase-glutathione . TWD patients had significantly lower copper metabolism parameters, higher total AOP and higher GSH levels than TWD patients; however, no difference was observed between these two patient groups with respect to the remaining parameters of antioxidant capacity. Patients who had undergone treatment with D-penicillamine or zinc sulfate did not differ in terms of copper metabolism or parameters of antioxidant capacity, with the exception of GPx, which was lower in those treated with D-penicillamine. These data suggest that anti-copper treatment affects copper metabolism and improves, but does not normalize, natural antioxidant capacity in patients with WM. We propose to conduct studies aimed at evaluating the utility of antioxidants as well as selenium as adjunctive therapy in WM. © 2013 The author(s).",,"Grazyna, G.;Agata, K.;Adam, P.;Tomasz, L.;Agata, W.

1412,Reversible brain parenchymal lesions in Wilson's disease confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging: Earlier administration of chelation therapy may reduce brain damage,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the resolution of brain lesions in patients with Wilson's disease during long-term chelation therapy using magnetic resonance imaging and a possible significance of the temporal latency between the first symptoms of the disease and the introduction of this therapy. An initial magnetic resonance examination was performed in 37 patients with proven neurological form of Wilson's disease with cerebellar, parkinsonian and dystonic presentation. A repeat magnetic resonance examination was performed 5.7 +/- 1.3 years later in 14 patients. Patients were divided into: Group A, in which chelation therapy was started < 24 months after the first symptoms, and Group B, in which therapy was started >= 24 months after the first symptoms. Lesion symmetry was observed in 100% of patients. There was a significant difference between Groups A and B in complete resolution of brainstem and putaminal lesions (P=0.005 and P=0.024, respectively). If the correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment are not made within 24 months of the onset of symptoms, irreversible lesions in the brain parenchyma can be expected. Signal abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging could therefore represent reversible myelinolysis or cytotoxic edema associated with copper toxicity, at least in the early stages.

1415,D-penicillamine-induced elastosis perforans serpiginosa involving the glans penis,"Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is an unusual perforating disease characterized by the extrusion of altered elastic fibers through the epidermis. Clinically, it presents as keratotic papules with a tendency toward serpiginous or annular distribution, most commonly affecting the sides of the neck and the back. However, involvement of the penis has rarely been reported. We present a case of EPS involving the neck, axilla, and glans penis in a 42-year-old man who had been on long-term treatment with D-penicillamine for Wilson's disease. Skin biopsy revealed perforating canals containing numerous altered elastic fibers with a characteristic ""hernia bush"" or ""lumpy-bumpy"" appearance as indicated by an elastin patch. The latter is considered pathognomonic for penicillamine-induced degenerative elastosis. These degenerative changes in the glans penis have rarely been described in the literature.

1419,Psychiatric Aspects of Wilson's Disease: A Review,"Aim: To review the current evidence on psychiatric symptoms in Wilson's disease (WD). Method: We searched Ovid, PsychInfo, CINHAL, and PubMed databases from May 1946 to May 2012 using the keywords Wilson's disease combined with psychiatry, psychiatry, psychosis, schizophrenia, depression, mania, bipolar, mood, anxiety, personality, and Behavior. Results: Psychiatric symptoms occur before, at the same time as, or after the diagnosis and treatment of WM. Thirty to forty percent of patients have psychiatric manifestations at the time of diagnosis, and 20% had seen a psychiatrist prior to their WM diagnosis. When psychiatric symptoms preceded neurological or hepatic involvement, the median time between psychiatric symptoms and the diagnosis of WM was 864.3 days. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in WM patients varies greatly (major depressive disorder 4-47%; psychosis 1.4-11.3%). Certain ATP7B gene mutations may correlate with certain personality traits. Conclusions: Psychiatric manifestations represent an important part of the clinical presentation of WM and can occur at any time during the course of the disease. Psychiatric manifestations that occur without overt hepatic or neurological involvement can lead to misdiagnosis.

Since the corresponding ATPase is responsible for the distribution and excretion of copper (Cu) in the liver, its malfunction leads to Cu overload. This brief review looks at treatments for this rare disease that aim to reduce Cu toxicity and are therefore based on chelation therapy. First, the drugs used since the 1950s are described, then a novel approach developed in our laboratory is presented. Since the liver is the main organ of Cu distribution in the body, we targeted the pool of intracellular Cu in hepatocytes. This Cu pool is in the +1 oxidation state and hence soft sulfur ligands inspired by binding sites found in metallothioneins were developed. Their targeting to the hepatocytes by functionalization with asialoglycoprotein receptor ligands led to their cellular incorporation and intracellular Cu chelation. © 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.",,"Gateau, C.;Delangle, P.",2014,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nyas.12379,0,0,

Medically refractory idiopathic dystonia and essential tremor (ET) have been successfully treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS), functional surgical therapy targeting the globus pallidus pars internala (GPi), or the ventral intermediate (Vim) thalamic nucleus. Although the pathophysiology of tremor differs in WD and ET, the available experience supports DBS targeting Vim for WD patients. Dystonia associated with WD is classified as secondary dystonia and GPi stimulation has produced mixed results in these patients. The presence of structural changes in the basal ganglia may limit the therapeutic success of DBS in WD dystonia compared to idiopathic dystonia. Despite these limitations, DBS in WM can be an effective approach to treating medically refractory residual neurological symptoms in carefully selected patients. © 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.",,"Hedera, P.",2014,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nyas.12372,0,0,

1429,Wilson disease. [Czech],"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which copper accumulates in tissues, particularly the liver and brain. The genetic defect affects the P-type ATPase gene (ATP7B). More than 500 mutations that cause Wilson's disease have been described. The most common mutation in Central Europe affects H1069Q. Symptoms of Wilson disease include hepatic or neurological disorders. The liver condition manifests as steatosis, acute or chronic hepatitis, or cirrhosis. The neurological diseases usually manifest themselves from the age of 20 as motor disorders (tremor, speech and writing disorders), which can lead to a severe extrapyramidal syndrome with stiffness, dysarthria and muscle contractions. Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory findings (neurological symptoms, liver lesions, low ceruloplasmin, increased free serum copper, high urinary Cu concentrations, Kayser-Fleischer ring). Diagnosis is confirmed by high levels of Cu in liver tissue or by genetic evidence. Left untreated, Wilson's disease leads to the patient's death. With proper treatment, the survival rate is approximately the same as that of the normal population. Treatment involves either removing copper from the body by chelating agents that are excreted in the urine (penicillamine, trientine) or limiting copper absorption from the gut and reducing copper toxicity (zinc, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate). In the Czech Republic, penicillamine or zinc are used. Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with fulminant liver failure or decompensated liver cirrhosis. In the family, all siblings of the affected person must be examined in order to treat all asymptomatic people.",,"Marecek, Z.;Bruha, R.",2014,,,0,0,
1430,Effect of molecular adsorbents on circulatory system treatment in children with acute liver failure caused by Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVES: Because fulminant Wilson disease (WD) has an extremely poor prognosis, the use of liver support that can bridge patients to liver transplantation is life-saving. We report the experience of albumin dialysis in acute liver failure (ALF) caused by WD in children. METHODS: Review of the charts of children admitted for ALF secondary to acute WD and treated with molecular adsorbents and circulatory systems. Measurements of blood and circulatory copper levels were taken during sessions using the Circulating Molecular Adsorption System (MARS). Clinical and biological assessments after the MARS session have been reported. RESULTS: Four children with a mean age of 12.3 years were treated from 2004 to 2009 for severe ALF associated with acute renal failure, hemolysis and severe cholestasis. All children had a new Wilson Index >12. A total of 14 MARS sessions with an average duration of 7.5 hours were conducted. Tolerability was good, with the exception of 1 child who bled after dialysis catheter insertion due to vascular injury. Neurologic improvement or stabilization was noted in all children along with improvement in Fisher's index and ammonia levels after MARS treatment. MARS was able to remove copper, lowering serum copper levels by a mean of 28% and lowering bilirubin and creatinine levels by >25%. All children subsequently underwent liver transplantation with good outcome without disability. CONCLUSIONS: MARS is able to remove copper and stabilize children with ALF secondary to WD, allowing bridging to LT.

1433,The effect of zinc and D-penicillamine in a stable human hepatoma ATP7B knockout cell line,"Mutations in the copper (Cu) transporter gene ATP7B, the main cause of Wilson disease (WD), result in high hepatic Cu levels and hepatocyte death. Cu chelating agents and zinc salts are the two main drugs used in the treatment of WM patients; However, the molecular mechanisms of the drugs related to ATP7B expression have not been determined. A targeted knockout of ATP7B (KO) was established in the most prevalent human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, for molecular studies on the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease. KO cells showed similar growth, Cu uptake, release and gene expression compared to parental cells. However, in the presence of Cu, morphological changes, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and loss of viability were observed. Metallothionein (MT1X) induction after Cu exposure was significantly reduced in KO cells. After zinc treatment, MT1X expression was strongly induced and a high percentage of KO cells could be rescued from Cu-induced toxicity. Treatment with D-penicillamine had little effect on KO cell viability, while the parental cell line showed significant improvement. The combined treatment showed a highly synergistic effect in KO cells. The data suggest that zinc has a previously unrecognized effect on the viability of hepatocytes lacking ATP7B due to high induction of MT1X expression compensating for low gene expression after Cu exposure. Combination therapy targeting MT1X induction and Cu chelation simultaneously improves overall hepatocyte survival for the most efficient therapy in patients with WM. © 2014 Chandhok et al.",,"Chandhok, G.;Schmitt, N.;Sauer, V.;Aggarwal, A.;Bhatt, M.;Schmidt, H.

Aim: To study the safety and efficacy of zinc gluconate therapy in Chinese children with pre-symptomatic WM. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed pre-symptomatic children receiving zinc gluconate at a single Chinese center specializing in pediatric hepatology. Short-term follow-up safety and efficacy data were presented and the effects of different zinc doses were compared. Results: 30 children (21 males) aged 2.7 to 16.8 years were followed for up to 4.4 years; Twenty-six (87%) children had abnormal ALT at baseline. Most patients (73%) received higher than the currently recommended dose of elemental zinc. Zinc gluconate significantly reduced mean ALT (p<0.0001), AST (p<0.0001), GGT (p<0.0001) levels at 1 month and urinary copper excretion at 6 months (p<0 .0054). Mean direct bilirubin levels fell significantly at 1 month (p=0.0175), 3 months (p=0.0010), and 6 months (p=0.0036). Serum zinc levels gradually increased and reached a significantly higher value at 6 months (p<0.0026), reflecting good compliance with therapy. Complete blood count parameters did not change during the analysis period. Eight children experienced mild and transient gastrointestinal side effects. The higher zinc dose had no effect on treatment response and was not associated with different or increased side effects compared to the conventional zinc dose. Conclusion: In our cohort, zinc gluconate therapy was effective for Chinese children with presymptomatic WM, and a higher starting dose of elemental zinc had the same efficacy as the conventional dose. © 2014 Abuduxikuer, Wang.",,"Abuduxikuer, K.;Wang, J.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2003 to December 2013, 65 WM patients (22 females and 43 males) with a mean age of 37 years (range 18-65 years) were analyzed. Survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method and logit model. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (43.08%) had only liver disease, thirty-two (49.23%) - with hepatic and neurological presentation, three - with neurological features without evidence of liver damage. There were also two asymptomatic patients. The following liver forms were detected: steatosis (in 6.6%), hepatitis (in 41.7%) and cirrhosis (in 51.7% of the patients). There was an average delay in diagnosis of 39 months. At the end of the study, 74.2% of patients with cirrhosis were Child A. Two patients developed acute liver failure after treatment discontinuation. We observed hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with liver cirrhosis. Six patients with liver cirrhosis in the Child-C stage had a fatal outcome during the observation. Three of them had comorbidities - HBV and autoimmune cirrhosis. The Kayser-Fleischer ring was detected in 35.4% of patients, more frequently in patients with neurological symptoms.

1439,Amelioration of the severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension in a patient receiving copper chelation therapy,"Introduction: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic, debilitating, and progressive disease leading to premature death, often due to right ventricular (RV) failure. The pathobiology of severe PAH is based on the formation of angioproliferative lung lesions that result in obstruction of blood flow. Recent experimental studies show that copper is necessary for the formation of the lesions and that copper chelation can prevent and even reverse the lesions. Tetrathiomolybdate is a potent copper chelator used to treat Wilson's disease and to treat refractory malignancies. Case Report: We hereby report the experience of using tetrathiomolybdate (ATN-224) for copper chelation in a patient diagnosed 3 years previously with idiopathic PAH. A 59-year-old woman with significant symptoms of exertional dyspnea and fatigue (New York Association Class III), despite treatment with amlodipine, bosentan, and sildenafil, was presented with a 6-minute walk test (417 m), cardiac catheterization (systolic and mean pulmonary artery pressure of 58/24 and 32 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance of 4.6 Holzunits), Doppler echocardiogram (showing a systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 73 mmHg) and cardiac magnetic resonance (RV ejection fraction 48% and stroke volume 75 ml). She was then started on ATN-224 (dose 150 mg twice daily), which she continued for 16 days before discontinuing due to hypotension. No other changes were made to the patient's therapy. Repeat assessment showed improved NYHA class (-1 class), improved 6-minute walk test (+83 m), decrease in Doppler-estimated pulmonary systolic pressure (-30 mmHg), and increase in RV ejection fraction (+ 11%) and stroke volume (+15 ml). Discussion: PAH is a progressive disease, and current treatments for PAH have minimal impact on pulmonary artery pressure and RV ejection fraction or stroke volume and are therefore viewed as slowing the progression of the disease rather than altering its course. The current case shows an unexpected change in the natural course of the disease, which appears to be related to the introduction of copper chelation therapy. While ATN-224 was poorly tolerated at the dose used (systemic blood pressure drop), we hypothesize that the short duration of treatment with ATN-224 resulted in a significant ""de-remodeling"" of pulmonary vascular lesions as observed in the experimental animal model of PAH. In our opinion, the result of this individual case justifies the performance of additional studies with copper chelation in PAH.",,"Grinnan, D.;Abbate, A.;Farr, G.;Bogaard, H. J.;Voelkel, N.

1440,Penicillamine-induced elastosis perforans serpiginosa: does it make sense to switch to zinc?,"Objective: Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is a rare, although not exceptional, cutaneous adverse reaction to penicillamine. Here, a 15-year-old Caucasian boy with neurologic and hepatic onset Wilson's disease (WD) is described who developed keratotic-granulomatous annular popular skin lesions on the neck and right arm during the 3rd year of penicillamine therapy. METHODS: WM was diagnosed at age 12 because of irregular proximal tremors, dysarthria, micrographs, labile mood, and inappropriate behavior. The patient also presented with hepatomegaly and splenomegaly with mild hypertransaminasemia. The diagnosis was based on low serum ceruloplasmin levels, high 24-hour urine copper levels, high liver copper concentrations, and bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings. Molecular analysis revealed the presence of a compound heterozygous mutation in the ATP7B gene. Therapy with penicillamine was initiated with a favorable response to neuropsychiatric symptoms. Liver function tests (LFTs) remained normal. Based on lesion characteristics and skin biopsy findings, EPS was diagnosed. Results: Treatment with topical steroids was tried without benefit. Because the skin lesions worsened with significant visual impact, penicillamine therapy was discontinued 3 months after onset of EPS and replaced with zinc acetate. In the following months, the skin lesions persisted unchanged with no histological evidence of progression after three years of zinc monotherapy, while the general clinical condition and LFTs remained normal. Conclusions: Although penicillamine is an effective and generally safe drug for patients with WM, the risk of some serious cutaneous and non-cutaneous adverse events may warrant more extensive use of zinc monotherapy as maintenance therapy in WM patients.",,"Ranucci, G.;Di Dato, F.;Leone, F.;Tufano, M.;Vajro, P.;Spagnuolo, M.

1441,Investigating the cause of death in patients with neurological Wilson disease,"Objectives: To study the cause of death in patients with neurological Wilson disease. Background: Wilson disease (WD) is a treatable autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism and is characterized by proteic manifestations due to accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, cornea, and other tissues. Although treatable, deaths in patients with WM are not uncommon. METHODS: We investigated the cause of death in 44 patients diagnosed with WD based on detailed clinical evaluation of the corneal Kayser-Fleischer ring and biochemical studies (decreased serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper and increased urinary copper) and neuroimaging. Results: A total of 6 patients (13.6%) died during the observation period. The main cause of death was delay in diagnosis. The median delay to diagnosis was 18.9 months for all patients and 25.4 months for those who died. Of the 6 patients who died, 5 patients had a dystonic presentation while 1 had a Parkinson's presentation. Five of the 6 patients were adolescents (less than 18 years of age) and one was an adult. Four of the 6 patients showed poor compliance to treatment (zinc and penicillamine) and regular follow-up. Conclusion: Early and correct diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and lifelong continuation can prevent devastating consequences as WM is a treatable condition.",,"Kumar, N.;Joshi, D.",2014,October,,0,0,
1442,"Wilson's disease: Ten years of retrospective experience at the National Liver Institute, Egypt","Background and Aims Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare, inherited, genetic disorder of copper metabolism. Our goal is to determine common clinical presentations, laboratory findings, diagnostic methods, and long-term outcomes in Egyptian patients. Methods All medical records between 2000 and 2010 in the Department of Pediatric Hepatology were reviewed. Detailed follow-up data on the disease were collected for each patient. Serum ceruloplasmin, liver function tests, and other routine laboratory tests. Slit-lamp examination for Kayser-Fleisher rings and 24-hour urine for copper before and after penicillamine challenge were performed. Percutaneous liver biopsy was also performed in most patients. Results The most significant hepatic presentations were jaundice and Kayser-Flisher rings. The most significant laboratory findings were copper excretion after provocation with depencillamine (1546.57 +/- 99.55 µg/dl) and decrease in the mean ceruloplasmin concentration (13.8 +/- 2.38 mg/dl) below 20 µg/dl. There was a significant increase in albumin and a significant improvement in prothrombin time after treatment. Conclusion Kayser-Flisher rings, urinary copper excretion and low serum ceruloplasmin were considered sufficient to establish the diagnosis of WM.

1443,A phase I study of the pharmacokinetic profile in patients receiving trientine dihydrochloride for the treatment of Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Trientine dihydrochloride (trientine) is widely used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, however pharmacokinetic data are limited to healthy subjects. The aim of the study was to determine PK parameters believed to be representative of steady-state in trientine-treated Wilson's disease patients. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01874028 PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty subjects (9 males, 4 children, mean age 39.3 years [12-61]) with a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson's disease were exposed to trientine after oral dosing at the standard dose for these subjects . Blood samples were taken 0.5; 1; 1.5; 2; 3; 4; 6; 8 and 12 hours after ingestion. The concentration of trientine in plasma samples was measured by LC-MS/MS after protein precipitation extraction over the calibration range of 20-2000 ng/mL. Results: Trientine was rapidly absorbed, with tmax occurring between 0.48 and 4.08 hours after dosing. There was some variability in exposure with a 10-fold range in Cmax and a 13.8-fold range in AUC0-t. This variability was slightly less when PK parameters were dose-normalized (6.7-fold range at Cmax/D and an 11.6-fold range at AUC0-t/D). The terminal half-life, when defined, was largely consistent between subjects (range 2.33 to 6.99 hours). AUC0-8 could be calculated in 14 of the 20 subjects, however, since dosing was at pharmacokinetic steady state, AUC0-t is representative of exposure over the dosing interval. There was no significant difference in PK parameters between adult subjects (n=16) and children (n=4). The Cmax range was 508-3100 ng/mL in adults and 309-1940 ng/mL in children - the corresponding ranges for AUC0-t were 1240-17100 ng.h/mL and 1500-8060 ng.h/mL, respectively. When PK parameters were normalized for the administered dose, Cmax/D and AUC0-t/D for children were within adult ranges. Conclusion: The pharmacokinetics of trientine in patients with Wilson's disease were similar to those in healthy subjects. (picture shown).",,"Weiss, K.

1444,Sex differences in liver SAM:SAH ratios and gene transcript levels after pre- and postnatal choline supplementation and copper chelation treatment in an animal model of Wilson's disease,"Background. Methionine metabolism, which is central to DNA methylation reactions, may provide epigenetic regulation of genes involved in liver damage in Wilson's disease (WD). We hypothesized that perinatal maternal choline treatment might alter the sex-specific response to penicillamine in the offspring in the tx-j model of WD. methods. Control (choline 8 mmol/kg) or choline-supplemented (36 mmol/kg) diets were fed to wild-type and tx-j female mice beginning 2 weeks prior to mating and continued in the offspring until 24 weeks of age . A subgroup of tx-j of both sexes received oral penicillamine with or without a choline-supplemented diet from 12 to 24 weeks of age. Results. The ratio of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), an index of DNA methylation capacity, was decreased in each sex of the offspring of tx-j mice, consistent with the known down-regulation of SAH hydrolase levels in this mouse model of compatible is WD (Table 1). The SAM:SAH ratio was higher in untreated female versus male tx-j mice (p<0.05). Separate choline or penicillamine treatments were associated with similar increases in SAM:SAH ratio in male tx-j levels compared to wild-type levels. While the ratio was increased in tx-j males by each separate treatment, it was decreased in tx-j females by each separate treatment, but remained unchanged in both sexes by the combination of choline and penicillamine. Transcript levels of Dnmt3b, a regulator of DNA methylation in tx-j mice, were elevated in untreated tx-j mice of both sexes and were down-regulated by separate or combined penicillamine and choline treatment in male tx-j mice, but remained so with all unchanged treatment in female tx-j mice. Grp78 transcript levels were increased in tx-j mice of both sexes, reduced to control levels in tx-j males by choline, but only by combined treatment with penicillamine and choline in female tx-j mice. Conclusions. Our results indicate differential sex-specific responses to copper chelate and methyl donors in the tx-j model of WD, which could explain different phenotypes between the sexes in WD.

1445,No increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease during long-term follow-up,"Background and Aims: Although cirrhosis of the liver is a common complication of Wilson's disease (WD), data on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in these patients are scarce. We here report HCC risk in a well-defined cohort with unequivocally demonstrated WD with long-term follow-up (FU), and correlate HCC risk with the effectiveness of decoppering treatment and liver disease severity. Methods: All patients with a confirmed WM diagnosis (Leipzig score >= 4) in three Dutch university hospitals were included in this retrospective cohort study. The end of FU was defined as the date of diagnosis of HCC, death from liver transplantation, or last available hospital visit. Results: A total of 130 patients with WM were followed for a median FU of 15 years (range 0.1-51.2). Total years of FU was 2336. Median age at diagnosis was 16 years (range 0-43). Presentation was asymptomatic, hepatic only, neurological, combined, and unknown in 4%, 55%, 9%, 30%, and 2% of cases, respectively. The median Leipzig score was 8 points (range 4-13). At baseline, 74 patients had cirrhosis (57% of the total: 64% compensated and 36% decompensated). At the end of FU, liver disease severity was improved, stable, or worsening in 20%, 46%, and 24% of all cases, respectively. Twenty-eight patients received liver transplantation. Five patients died from complications of their liver disease and two deaths were related to liver transplantation. In patients treated for at least one year (n=111), zinc, penicillamine, or trientine (alone, sequentially, or in combination) was prescribed in 92%, 69%, and 14% of patients, respectively. At the end of the FU, the effectiveness of decoppering was based on the values of serum copper concentration not bound to ceruloplasmin (target: < 10 mg/dl) and 24-hour urinary copper excretion (target: < 100 mg/24 hours). excellent in 34% of patients, moderate in 42%, poor in 13% and unknown in 11%. Two patients developed HCC. The first patient was a 39-year-old male and presented with decompensated cirrhosis combined with HCC. The second patient was a 63-year-old woman with definite WM diagnosed 50 years earlier. Despite excellent decoupling at the end of FU, she developed decompensated cirrhosis in which HCC developed. There were no additional risk factors for liver disease in either patient. The estimated annual risk of HCC for all patients was 0.09% (95% confidence interval: 0.01-0.28). The subgroup analysis in cirrhotic patients resulted in an annual risk of HCC of 0.14% (95% confidence interval: 0.02-0.45). Conclusion: Even in the case of cirrhosis, the risk of HCC in Wilson's disease is low and does not appear to be related to decoppering efficiency. Our data does not support regular HCC monitoring in WD.",,"Van Meer, S.;De Man, R. A.;Van Den Berg, A. P.;Houwen, R.;Linn, F.;Siersema, P. D.;Van Erpecum, K.

1446,Neuropsychiatric interface in a patient with depression,"Psychiatric manifestations are significantly predominant in the majority of patients with Wilson disease (WD) at the time of onset. Almost half of patients are admitted to a psychiatric hospital before being diagnosed with WM. Aims/Goals: To report a case of WD presenting with unresponsive depression. METHODS: A 31-year-old man presented with complaints of gradual onset of withdrawn behavior, irritability, sadness of mood, and slowness of movement for 1 year. The diagnosis of major depression was made by a private psychiatrist. He was started on antidepressants and received 10 electroconvulsive therapies. However, he did not notice any improvement and stopped the treatment because of side effects. Patient presented to KJSH after 6 months due to worsening of symptoms. On request h/o trembling, slurred speech and body leaning back when sitting for several months. Neurological examination revealed lively deep tendon reflexes. With MSE, the patient had delayed psychomotor activity, grimacing movements with mannerisms. His mood was sad with reduced affect. Ideas of helplessness, hopelessness, and death wishes were expressed. MRI showed gliosis with calcification in bilateral basal ganglia. Keyser-Fleischer ring seen during ophthalmological examination. Investigations revealed increased liver enzymes and a high Cu content in the urine. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease and began tab penicillamine. Discussion: Although WD is rare, it often presents with psychiatric symptoms. Depression is very common in WM patients, affecting 30-60% of them. The mood disorder shows a limited response to antidepressants, while chelating agent use results in normalization of mood and improvement in non-psychiatric symptoms. Conclusion: Psychiatrists need to be aware of the psychiatric manifestations of WM. Differentiation of Wilson's disease can be considered if the patient responds poorly or is overly sensitive to psychotropic drugs. Comprehensive management of WM requires a consultative liaison across multiple specialties such as neurology and ophthalmology.",,"Dere, S. S.;Shah, B.;Jadhav, B.;Dhavale, H.",2014,January,,0,0,
1447,Morbus Wilson: catatonia as the only manifestation,"Introduction: Catatonia is a clinical entity with diverse causes ranging from infectious to metabolic causes. Wilson's disease is one of the known causes of catatonia, but catatonia has been reported as a rare occurrence (0.01%) of Wilson's disease. We hereby report a case of Wilson's disease presenting as catatonia as the sole manifestation. Case Report: Ms. S, a 20-year-old young unmarried Muslim woman, presented with an acute onset 5-month history suggestive of catatonia (mutism, stupor, ambition, waxy flexibility, and rigidity). The patient had no history of psychiatric disorders. There was a family history of suicide in one older brother and two older sisters who had died of a 7-month illness of similar presentation. The patient failed to respond to the 3-day intravenous lorazepam study and 10 modified electroconvulsive therapies. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple hyperintensities in the inner capsule and basal ganglia. Ultrasound (USG) abdomen was normal. Biochemical tests showed increased copper in the urine, decreased copper in the serum and decreased ceruloplasmin in the blood. Slit lamp examination was unremarkable and neuropsychiatric examination revealed a catatonic state with no obvious cardinal neurological manifestations of Wilson's disease. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made and the patient improved with penicillamine, zinc sulfate and lorazepam. Implications: Wilson's disease should be maintained as a differential diagnosis in young adults with catatonia.",,"Singh, A. P.;Kukreti, A. K. P.;Jhirwal, O.",2014,January,,0,0,
1448,Metal chelating pseudopeptides and their potential medical applications,"Wilson disease (WD) is one of the most important genetic disorders of copper (Cu) metabolism in humans. In this rare disease, the ATPase ATP7B, which is responsible for the elimination of excess Cu from the liver cells, is defective and consequently toxic Cu accumulates in the liver [1]. For the treatment of WD, we propose innovative Cu chelators with the following properties: (i) they show high affinity for Cu(I), the oxidation state of excess intracellular Cu, (ii) they are selective for Cu(I). they are water soluble compared to potentially competing endogenous metals such as Zn(II) and (iii). Mimics of binding sites found in proteins involved in Cu homeostasis are good candidates that meet all of these expectations. Therefore, pseudopeptides have been developed that mimic Cu(I) coordination by metal-sequestering proteins such as metallothioneins. They are made up of nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) as a tripodal anchor and functionalized with the three amino acids cysteine or D-penicillamine [2, 3]. The C<inf>3</inf>-symmetric nonbiological framework acts as a platform that aligns the three bonding arms in the same direction to coordinate the Cu(I) ion. To promote intracellular Cu chelation and internalization in hepatocytes, these sulfur ligands were functionalized with sugar moieties to target liver cells via the asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGP-R). The obtained glycoconjugates were shown to release Cu-chelating agents with high affinity in the liver cells. This confirms that the use of intracellular Cu(I) chelators is very promising to treat Cu overload in WD [4]. (picture shown) .",,"Jullien, A.

1449,Potential effects of copper chelation on iron homeostasis in patients with Wilson's disease. Effect of penicillamine on the activity of ceruloplasmin ferroxidase,"Introduction: Ceruloplasmin (Cp) belongs to the multi-copper ferroxidase family of proteins. It is involved in the Fe loading of serum transferrin. Defective copper loading in apo-ceruloplasmin (Apo-Cp) may result from mutations in the ATP7B gene that characterize Wilson disease (WD). Patients with WD are treated with copper chelators such as penicillamine (PA). Aims and Methods: We postulate that cuchelators reduce copper incorporation into Apo-Cp, which affects ferroxidase activity; consequently disrupt iron homeostasis. We hereby investigate the in vitro effect of Cu and Cu-PA on HepG2 viability (MTT assay), Cp ferroxidase activity (pPD oxidase assay), and expression of Cp, ferritin and transferrin (Western blotting). In addition, we examine the activity of serum Cp ferroxidase activity in 5 WD patients homozygous for a mutation in the WND gene and treated with PA. Results and Conclusions: In vitro: Cu reduced (50%) the viability of HepG2 cells, while co-treatment with Cu-PA significantly altered cell morphology, further reduced cell viability (70%) and cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase induced. Cp expression in HepG2 cells increased with Cu, decreased with PA, and did not vary with Cu-PA. Ferritin expression in HepG2 cells decreased in cells treated with Cu, PA and Cu-PA. Transferrin expression showed a qualitative decrease in PA and Cu-PA treated cells control (0.022-0.027 units). A slight increase was noted in 2 patients, while the transferrin level was within the normal range. Cp ferroxidase activity was significantly reduced in both HepG2 cells and serum from MV patients. The recommended lifelong treatment with Cu chelating agents would affect Fe incorporation into transferrin, which consequently may lead to Fe deposition in the liver. The implication of our results requires reassessment of PA-treated WM patients for iron complications.",,"Usta, J.;Majarian, T.;El-Rifai, O.;Barada, K.",2014,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.12919,0,0,
1450,Symptomatic copper deficiency in patients with Wilson's disease treated with zinc sulfate,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by copper excess leading to copper accumulation and requiring lifelong decopper treatment. However, overtreatment with anticopper drugs can cause copper deficiency, which can be associated with neurological and haematological symptoms. We report on a WM patient with copper deficiency during zinc sulfate therapy. Case Report: A 37-year-old woman with pre-symptomatic MV, diagnosed in 1998 and treated with zinc sulfate, was admitted to our clinic in 2013 for 3 months of paresthesia in the fingers and toes. Her neurological examination was normal. She had leukopenia (WBC 2.9 x 10<sup>9</sup>L, normal range 4.5-10.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Serum ceruloplasmin 0.92 mg/dl (normal range 25-45), copper serum concentration < 5 μg/dl (normal range 70-140), copper excretion in the urine 11 μg/24 h (normal range 0-50) were significantly reduced. MRI of the cervical spine showed a linearly increased T2 signal lesion in the posterior column of the cervical cord. Somatosensory evoked potentials showed impaired conduction in the dorsal column. Electromyography showed no neuropathy. The vitamin B12 level was within the normal range. Liver function tests were normal. Zinc sulfate has been withdrawn. Within 1 month the leukopenia resolved completely. Serum ceruloplasmin (5 mg/dl) and serum copper concentration (20 lg/dl) 6 months later were higher than in previous tests. The copper excretion in the urine was still low (12.5 μg/24 h). The MRI of the cervical spine 6 months later shows a clear improvement. Nine months after stopping the anti-copper treatment, D-penicillamine was introduced in place of zinc sulfate. Conclusion: Copper deficiency as a result of anti-copper treatment can cause neurological and hematological symptoms.

The aim is to review the genetic aspects, diagnosis and treatment of Neuro-Wilson through a series of patients observed at the Neurology Department of Sahloul, CHU Sousse. METHODS: We report on seven cases collected at the Department of Neurology CHU Sahloul Sousse. All patients had neurological symptoms with or without extraneurological symptoms. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was based on clinical, biological and radiological findings. Results: Seven patients, two boys and five girls. The mean age was 25.5 years with an extreme of 14 to 48 years. Neurological signs denigrated the disease in six patients and the most common symptom was tremor. One patient had cerebellar ataxia and another had seizures. Three of the patients had a familial form with autosomal recessive inheritance. Kayser Flecher's ring was found on a patient. Copper balance was disturbed in all patients, including associated hemochromatosis. Cerebral MRI was abnormal in two patients with lesions in the basal ganglia. All patients were treated with D-penicillamine with good progress in five patients. Conclusions: Left untreated, Wilson's disease is always fatal.

1452,Mixed-type polyneuropathy in Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder with impaired copper metabolism that predominantly affects the central nervous system and the liver. Peripheral nervous system involvement is rarely reported in association with WM and is not well characterized. Objectives: Report on a WM patient with peripheral neuropathy. Theme: Case Report. Setting: Neurology Diagnostic Unit, POSan Martino, Oristano, Italy Methods: A 58-year-old man suffering from WD on therapy with trientine referred to our center because of mild weakness of the distal limbs with hypoesthesia. Clinical evaluation revealed mild leg weakness with foot drop and hyporreflexia. A nerve conduction study was performed using standard techniques (Medtronic Keypoint v5.09). Distal motor latency, F-wave latency, motor nerve conduction velocity, and CMAP were assessed in the deep peroneal, posterior tibial, median, and ulnar nerves; sensory nerve conduction velocity and SAP were measured in the sural, superficial peroneal, median, ulnar, and radial nerves. When analyzing his anamnestic and laboratory data, no other cause of the polyneuropathy was found. Results: Electroneurographic findings indicated an asymmetric length-dependent mixed-type sensorimotor neuropathy. Conclusion: We confirmed the involvement of the peripheral nervous system in WM. According to the literature, our findings also showed both myelin and axon damage. Despite treatment, polyneuropathy can occur, although iatrogenic involvement cannot be ruled out.",,"Aste, R.;Salaris, E.;Pische, M. G.;Floris, E. R.",2014,June,,0,0,
1453,A novel pathogenic ATP7B mutation in a Thai patient with very mild Wilson's disease,"Aim: To describe a novel mutation in Wilson's disease and its clinical manifestations. Background: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that arises from mutation of the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13. The H1069Q mutation, which is the most common mutation in the United States and northern Europe, is associated with late onset and less severity. Methods: A 39-year-old woman with a master's degree. She presented with progressive right hand dystonia and had noted mild weakness in her right hand for the past 25 years. Three years after onset, it progressed to generalized dystonia and chorea. She had no tremors, stiffness, or seizures. She had no history of psychiatric problems and no other underlying illness. There was no family history of WD. She was diagnosed with WD at another hospital, but lost follow-up care for 5 years. Physical examination showed no signs of chronic liver stigmata. She had generalized dystonia, more pronounced on the right hand and orobuccolingual region, and generalized chorea, more pronounced on the left side. She had slight left side weakness and normal eye movements. Eye examination showed Kayser-Fleischer ring. She had no stiffness or tremors, had normal cerebellar sign, normal feeling and no other signs of long pathways. Investigations revealed a low serum ceruloplasmin level, 2 mg/dl (20-60), a normal serum copper level, 0.33 ppm (0.66-1.50) and a high urinary copper level , 98 µg/24 h-ur (17-43). Liver function tests and synthetic liver function tests were within the normal range. The brain MRI showed typical features of WD. Mutation screening in all 21 exons of the ATP7B gene was performed using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, followed by sequencing of the altered fragments. Results: A novel single base deletion resulting in a novel frameshift translation, NM-000053.2(ATP7B) c.3168delT;p.Leu1057 Trpfs*64 and a splicing defect in intron 17, NM-000053.2(ATP7B) c.3700- 1G>C (IVS17-1G>C) were identified in this patient. She was treated with D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate. Clinically improved. KF ring gone. Serum ceruloplasmin and urine copper levels returned to the normal range. Conclusions: The patient presented with progressive generalized chorea dystonia without other typical signs and symptoms of WM. The severity of the illness was mild. The genetic test showed a novel mutation of WD. This mutation can be associated with a favorable prognosis.

1454,To evaluate the response to treatment in patients with neurological Wilson disease,"Aim: To evaluate treatment response in patients with neurological Wilson disease. Background: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which makes a protein important for copper transport and excess copper clearance. from the body. The disease has features that indicate primarily liver and brain involvement. It most commonly affects children or young adults and is invariably fatal if not adequately treated with decoppering therapy. Zinc and Dpenicillamine are the commonly available drugs to treat WD in India. Methods: This study was conducted in 31 patients diagnosed with WD based on clinical features indicative of WD; Detection of the Kayser-Fleischer ring in the cornea by slit lamp examination and biochemical parameters (24-hour copper in the urine above 100 micrograms/day; serum ceruloplasmin below 20 mg/dl and serum copper below 75 micrograms/dl). All patients received zinc and penicillamine. Results: All 31 patients began zinc (elemental zinc 50–2150 mg/day) and copper chelation therapy with penicillamine (250–1500 mg/day). Neurological deterioration occurred in 16 (51.6%), decreased platelets in 13 (54.2%), increased transaminases in 6 (19.4%) and rash in 5 (16.1%) patients. In these patients, penicillamine was discontinued and resumed after stabilization of clinical and biochemical parameters. Adjunctive therapy with trihexyphenidyl, levodopa and pyridoxine was used. After reintroduction of penicillamine, 10 (32.25%) patients showed improvement. Of the remaining 6 (19.4%) patients, 4 (12.9%) never recovered to their pre-penicillamine status and were lost at follow-up. The remaining 2 (6.45%) patients continued to deteriorate and died. A 24-hour urinary copper measurement was performed in patients to monitor treatment adequacy. Variable improvements were noted - 13 (41.9%) fully improved to pre-illness levels of functioning; 12 (38.7%) showed incomplete improvement with sequelae; 4 (12.9%) were lost in follow-up and 2 (6.45%) patients died. Conclusions: Twenty-five (80.6%) of our patients showed improvement, with more than half showing complete improvement. Therefore, early and correct diagnosis, together with the initiation of appropriate treatment (with careful clinical and biochemical monitoring) and lifelong continuation, can prevent devastating consequences as the disease is treatable.",,"Kumar, N.;Joshi, D.",2014,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25914,0,0,
1455,A case of copper deficiency myelopathy with features of parkinsonism and brain iron accumulation,"Aim: To present a case of copper deficiency myelopathy with features of parkinsonism and brain iron accumulation. Background: Copper deficiency myelopathy (CDM) occurs as a consequence of acquired copper deficiency and is similar in appearance to the subacute combined degeneration associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Acquired copper deficiency is rare and can occur as a result of gastric surgery, excessive zinc intake, prolonged TPN, and malabsorption. Progressive spastic tetraparesis, paraesthesia, and sensory atactic gait are seen in CDM. Characteristic MRI findings are hyperintensities in the posterior columns of the cervical spine with extension into the brainstem. Hypotension on MRI of the brain has not been reported. We report a case of CDM with features of parkinsonism and brain iron accumulation. Results: An 81-year-old man presented with a 20-year history of progressive gait instability, leg rigidity, and macrocytic anemia. He was diagnosed and treated for vitamin B12 deficiency. Serum ceruloplasmin (CP), copper (Cu), and urinary Cu excretion values were consistently low at 10.3 mg/dl, 0.48 mcg/ml, and 9 µg/spec. The patient denied a history of gastric surgery or excessive zinc supplementation. He was treated with oral and intravenous Cu with no response. Five years after the presentation he was found to have Parkinson's including; Bradykinesia, stiffness, masked face, hypophonia and sialorrhea. He had a clearly stooped posture and a spastic gait. An attempt with levodopa was unsuccessful. Brain MRI showed iron deposition consistent with aceruloplasminemia (ACP). Iron, transferrin, ferritin, zinc and HgbA1c were normal. CP genetic testing revealed no previously identified mutations consistent with ACP. Conclusions: This case is unique in two respects: no underlying cause of Cu deficiency without correction of post-treatment serum levels, and brain iron accumulation found on MRI, suggestive of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). MRI findings and low urinary Cu excretion rule out Wilson's disease (WD). This case appears to belong to a subset of patients with low CP and Cu levels who do not fit either the WD or ACP diagnosis. This combination of CDM and NBIA has not been described and could represent either a new form of ACP or two coexisting diseases in a single individual. Brain MRI should be performed in cases of CDM, particularly in patients with progressive symptoms or failure to respond to Cu supplementation.",,"Frei, K.

1456,Symptomatic copper deficiency in a patient with Wilson's disease treated with zinc sulfate,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by copper excess leading to copper accumulation and requiring lifelong decopper treatment. However, overtreatment with anticopper drugs can cause copper deficiency, which can be associated with neurological and haematological symptoms. We report on a WM patient with copper deficiency during zinc sulfate therapy. Case Report: A 37-year-old woman with pre-symptomatic MV, diagnosed in 1998 and treated with zinc sulfate, was admitted to our clinic in 2013 for 3 months of paresthesia in the fingers and toes. Her neurological examination was normal. She had leukopenia (WBC 2.9 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L, normal range 4.5-10.5 x 10-9/L). Serum ceruloplasmin 0.92 mg/dl (normal range 25-45), serum copper concentration < 5 μ; g/dl (normal range 70-140), urinary copper excretion 11 μ; g/24h (normal range 0-50) were significantly reduced. MRI of the cervical spine showed a linearly increased T2 signal lesion in the posterior column of the cervical cord. Somatosensory evoked potentials showed impaired conduction in the dorsal column. Electromyography showed no neuropathy. The vitamin B12 level was within the normal range. Liver function tests were normal. Zinc sulfate has been withdrawn. Within 1 month the leukopenia resolved completely. Serum ceruloplasmin (5 mg/dl) and serum copper concentration (20 µg/dl) 6 months later were higher than in previous tests. The copper excretion in the urine was still low (12.5 µg/24 h). The MRI of the cervical spine 6 months later shows a clear improvement. Nine months after stopping the anti-copper treatment, D-penicillamine was introduced in place of zinc sulfate. Conclusion: Copper deficiency as a result of anti-copper treatment can cause neurological and hematological symptoms. Treatment must be monitored regularly.",,"Dziezyc, K.;Sobanska, A.;Litwin, T.;Chabik, G.;Czlonkowska, A.",2014,May,,0,0,
1457,Neuro-Wilson's disease - about seven cases and review of the literature,"Introduction: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive copper overlap disorder dominated by neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms. The aim is to review the genetic aspects, diagnosis and treatment of Neuro-Wilson through a series of patients observed at the Neurology Department of Sahloul, CHU Sousse. METHODS: We report on seven cases collected at the Department of Neurology CHU Sahloul Sousse. All patients had neurological symptoms with or without extraneurological symptoms. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was based on clinical, biological and radiological findings. Results: Seven patients, two boys and five girls. The mean age was 25.5 years with an extreme of 14 years to 48 years. Neurological signs revealed the disease in six patients and the most common symptom was tremor. One patient had cerebellar ataxia and another had seizures. Three of the patients had a familial form with autosomal recessive inheritance. Kayser Flecher's ring was found on a patient. Copper balance was disturbed in all patients, including associated hemochromatosis. Cerebral MRI was abnormal in two patients with lesions in the basal ganglia. All patients were treated with D-penicillamine with good progress in five patients. Conclusions: Left untreated, Wilson's disease is always fatal. The treatment is based on the chelating copper, zinc salts and liver transplantation. The prognosis of Wilson's disease appears even better since the neurological and liver symptoms are not pronounced.",,"Algia, L. B.;Chatti, I.;Benhalima, M.;Saied, Z.;Khefifi, A.;Amor, S.

1458,Pregnancy in women with Wilson's disease: the copper compound,"Background Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism characterized by liver cirrhosis and neurological disorders. This is a report on two patients with Wilson's disease and their successful journey through pregnancy and breastfeeding. From India there are only a few reports on the outcome of a pregnancy in Wilson's disease (WD). The authors of this study emphasize that pregnancy in Wilson's disease is safe and successful if treatment with a chelating agent is continued uninterrupted. Case Case one was a 30-year-old G4P1L1A2 with a known case of Wilson's disease since he was 7 years old. She has had two miscarriages and one cesarean section in the past. She had been taking D-penicillamine since she was 7, switched to zinc sulfate during pregnancy as recommended by a neurophysicist. She delivered by elective caesarean section and continued zinc sulfate treatment postnatally. Case two was a 24-year-old G2A1 who was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at age 13. She had been taking D-penicillamine and continued to do so throughout the pregnancy. She had independently discontinued penicillamine therapy 1 year before her pregnancy and developed severe psychotic symptoms, mood disorders and memory impairment. She was treated again with D-penicillamine, with symptoms rapidly improving. She had a healthy baby through a normal vaginal delivery. Conclusion Successful pregnancies and uncomplicated deliveries can occur in treated WM mothers. These women require anti-copper therapy during their pregnancy. The primary goal of treatment is to protect the mother from copper toxicity while protecting the fetus from possible teratogenesis due to low copper levels. Treatment with D-penicillamine during pregnancy can control the disease without harming the fetus. Treatment should not be interrupted during pregnancy and zinc therapy should be considered. In patients with Wilson's disease who wish to conceive, their liver function and copper status should be evaluated.",,"Mehta, P.;Vishwanath, U.;Agarwal, P.",2014,April,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.12788,0,0,
1459,Complete neurological recovery in Wilson's disease: experience in 100 consecutive patients from 2005 to 2013,"AIM: To study the neurological sequelae of Wilson's disease (WD) after decoppering. BACKGROUND: Careful decopping can prevent WD-related mortality and reverse neurological disability. DESIGN/METHODS: From 2005-2013, we prospectively recruited 100 consecutive patients with WM and WM-related neurological disability. All received penicillamine or trientine at recommended doses (125 mg/day - up to 2 g/day) in the initial decoppering phase of treatment. Treatment was monitored using the standard WD-specific scale, the Global Assessment Scale of Wilson Disease (GAS for WD). RESULTS: There was no mortality during the eight-year study period. Of the 100 patients, 56 were men. The mean age at onset was 12.4 years (range 3-35). According to the three-point scale of disease severity (SS3), at recruitment, 43% of patients had severe neurological impairment (defined as bedridden, mute, enteral feeding, and requiring urinary catheterization). While 37% had moderate and 20% had mild neurological disability. Dystonia was the most common movement disorder (77%), followed by parkinsonism (53%) and tremor (47%). Of the 100 patients, 4 could not be followed up after the first visit, and 2 did not respond to decoppering. All other 94 patients demonstrated significant neurologic recovery over a median follow-up of 20.7 months (range 4-36). Seventy percent of the 94 patients (including 68% of those with severe neurological disability) showed a complete neurological recovery and were able to resume normal life on an equal footing with their peers. At the last follow-up, 30% of the 94 patients showed sustained recovery. Promising improvements have also been observed in various movement disorders, including dystonia and parkinsonism. Adverse events observed included neurological deterioration caused by transient decoupling (n=15), thrombocytopenia (n=20), psychosis occurring (n=10), rash (n=6), non-traumatic fracture (n=4), and Penicillamine-induced lupus (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: Our report reaffirms that remarkable neurological recovery can be expected in patients with WM with careful decopping. Objective clinical assessments help monitor treatment and track disability resolution.",,"Aggarwal, A.;Bhatt, M.",2014,,,0,1,
1460,Therapeutic efficacy of D-penicillamine-encapsulated alginate nanoparticles in the Wistar rat model of non-Wilson brain copper toxicosis,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered D-penicillamine-loaded nanoparticles (7.2 mg D-penicillamine/200 g body weight/day) compared to conventional D-penicillamine (14.4 mg D- penicillamine/200 g body weight/day) for 90 days in the Wistar rat model of non-Wilson's brain copper toxicosis, absorption spectrophotometry, biochemical estimation, neurobehavioural and histopathological studies, and the preparation of nanoparticles and their physicochemical characterization were performed. Results: D-penicillamine nanoparticles showed a mean size of 274.09 nm coupled with less than 29.32% of D-penicillamine release over 2 hours under in vitro conditions. Pharmacokinetic studies showed increased brain levels of D-penicillamine in the nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine administration group compared to the conventional D-penicillamine administration group. Conventional and nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy resulted in significantly improved neuromuscular coordination and memory along with a concomitant increase in urinary copper levels and acetylcholinesterase activity in the rat model of copper toxicosis. Conventional D-penicillamine therapy resulted in negative rhodanine staining of liver and brain sections, confirmed by 60.1%, and a 16.4% reduction in copper content in liver and brain, each compared to not treated copper-poisoned group. However, liver and brain sections of the nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy group showed grade 1 copper deposits and no copper deposits, as indicated by a 47.2% and 32.8% reduction in copper levels in the liver and brain, respectively, compared to the untreated copper-poisoned group was occupied. Conclusions : Taken together, the present study provides the first in vivo evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy in chelating more brain copper and alleviating neurological deficits, even at half the dose used at conventional D-penicillamine therapy.",,"Pal, A.;Prasad, R.;Vasishta, R.;Thapa, B.",2014,,,0,0,
1461,"Pregnancy history at Wilson Disease Center, 20 years of experience","Introduction: To treat or not, the course of pregnancy in patients with Wilson's disease, and drug safety in lactation are issues that are not well understood. Materials and Methods: In this study, 194 patients (156 index cases) at the Medical Faculty of Istanbul were retrospectively examined for pregnancy with a median follow-up of 51 months (13-105 months) and 1069 patient-years. All patients met the criteria of the EASL 2012 Wilson disease guideline. Results: 20 (16 index cases) of 84 women had a total of 49 pregnancies. At presentation, 7 patients had decompensated cirrhosis, 4 had compensated cirrhosis, 6 had neurological symptoms (dysarthria, tremor, etc.), and 9 were in the premirrhotic stage. Of 16 pregnancies prior to diagnosis, 9 resulted in spontaneous abortion. Of 33 post-diagnosis pregnancies, 5 resulted in spontaneous abortion and 5 were terminated (one due to fetal abnormality and 4 at the patient's request). Out of 23 live births, one was born prematurely and died within three weeks. The other 22 have had no anomalies reported and are alive and well. One patient was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and Wilson's disease after 7 abortions. Under treatment, she had a live birth after two miscarriages. One of the patients who stopped taking her medication during pregnancy died of liver failure two months after delivery. The other patient developed a tremor in the third trimester and her treatment was restarted. Drug doses were reduced during pregnancy; One patient was treated with zinc (100 mg/day), one with trientine 600 mg plus zinc 100 mg and others with D-penicillamine 600 mg/day and zinc 100 mg/day. Copper deficiency did not occur in any of the pregnancies. The patients breastfed their babies. After lactation, drug doses were increased as needed. No wound healing problems occurred after caesarean section in 10 patients treated with D-penicillamine (600 mg/d). Conclusion: Wilson patients can become pregnant on combination therapy (chelator and zinc) even if they have decomposed cirrhosis. During pregnancy, medications should be administered twice daily (D-penicillamine 600 mg/day, trientine 600 mg/day, zinc 100 mg/day) and treatments should never be discontinued. In given doses, D-penicillamine does not impair wound healing after cesarean section. No complications were encountered when treatment was continued during lactation as long as the mother was properly informed, but further studies are needed to better understand the issue.",,"Demir, K.;Soyer, O.

Results: Trientine nanoparticles showed an average size of 351 nm and less than 34% trientine release. Pharmacokinetic studies showed increased levels of trientine in the brain of the nanoparticle-based trientine administration group compared to the conventional trientine administration group. Conventional and nanoparticle-based trientine therapy resulted in significantly improved neuromuscular coordination and memory along with a concomitant increase in urinary Cu levels and acetylcholinesterase activity in the rat model of Cu toxicosis. Conventional trientine therapy resulted in negative rhodanine staining of liver and brain sections, confirmed by 63%, and a 16% reduction in copper levels in liver and brain, each compared to the untreated Cu-poisoned group.

1463,Wilson's Disease Experience at Medical Faculty in Istanbul O,"Introduction: Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms associated with a positive copper balance. With chelation therapy, it is possible to improve survival and quality of life, even during a decompensated stage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-center study, we shared the 20-year experience related to the diagnosis and treatment of 194 cases (156 indices) diagnosed according to the EASL 2012 criteria of Wilson's disease. Patients with acute liver failure were excluded and all possible causes of liver disease were investigated. Results: 56.7% (110) of all patients were male, with a mean age of 22.3 +/- 10 years at diagnosis, with a delay in diagnosis of 19 +/- 33 (0-168) months. 35.7% of all patients had a hepatic form, 20.7% a neurological form and 28.9% a hepatoneurological form. 14.7% of patients were asymptomatic. Family screening revealed 38 patients, 24% of whom had compensated liver cirrhosis and 39.5% had normal findings. HBsAg positivity was 3.1%, anti-HCV 0.5%. Patients had low serum ceruloplasmin levels (< 20 mg/dl) 86%, increased 24-h urinary copper excretion (> 100 mcg) 89.9%, and increased liver copper concentration (> 250 mcg/g) 84, 7% Over the course of treatment, ceruloplasmin levels decreased in 89% of patients and were below the diagnostic cutoff (p<0.05). More common in patients with neurological symptoms, 65.7% had a Kayser-Fleischer ring. Serum albumin levels increased, transaminase levels decreased, prothrombin time decreased, and clinical ascites significantly disappeared under treatment. Four individuals with noncompliance developed neurological symptoms. In 10 patients, treatment with D-penicillamine was switched to trientine due to increased neurological symptoms. During follow-up, we lost 15 patients to medication noncompliance; one patient due to duodenal variceal bleeding and one patient due to sepsis (D-penicillamine treatment exacerbated referential dysphagia and caused aspiration pneumonia). 315 siblings from 93 index cases were screened. In 89 cases, secondary examinations were ordered because a diagnostic criterion was met. The parents of 46.4% were married within the family. Conclusion: Several markers of copper metabolism should be used in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease and family members must be tested.

1464,Low albumin and high alanine transaminases are helpful in predicting poor outcome of drug therapy in chronic Wilson's liver disease (CLD)?,"Introduction: The New Wilson Index is not a reliable predictor of outcome in chronic Wilson liver disease. The aim of this study was to examine the predictive risk factors for a poor outcome in Wilson's disease, which presents as chronic liver disease. METHODS: Wilson's disease (WD) presenting as CLD was treated with D-pencillamine (10-20 mg/kg/day) and zinc combination therapy. A univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to see the association of risk factors with a poor outcome (liver transplantation or death) at the time of diagnosis. Results: 33 cases were presented in the last 3 years. Five of 7 with acute chronic liver failure (ACLF), 6 of 20 with decompensated CLD had a poor outcome. All 6 compensated CLD, 2 of 7 ACLF and 14 of 20 with decompensated CLD improved. On univariate analysis, bilirubin, AST, ALT, Child-Pughs score, and New Wilson Index score were significantly higher in patients with poor outcomes. Logistic regression analysis found a significant association with poor outcome for high ALT (adjusted OR 1.062, 95% CI 1.007-1.12, p=0.015) and low albumin (adjusted OR 0.052, 95% CI 0.005-0.56, p=0.028). A 20 IU increase in ALT increases the odds ratio by 3.3 (95% CI 1.15 to 9.58) and a 1 gram decrease in albumin increases the odds ratio by 0.95 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.995 ). Conclusion: High ALT and low albumin are independently associated with poor outcome of drug therapy in WD presenting as CLD. The Child Pugh and New Wilson index scores showed no significant association with poor outcome.",,"Alam, S.;Khanna, R.;Sood, V.;Rawat, D.",2014,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12072-014-9519-7,0,0,
1465,Report of the ASFA apheresis registry study in Wilson's disease,"Purpose: Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder (1:30,000) of the ATP7B gene resulting in accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, cornea and kidney. Although treatment options such as low-copper diets, zinc acetate, tetrathiomolybdate, and copper chelate are available, patients may be in crisis either before their disease is diagnosed or after diagnosis due to ineffectiveness or intolerance to current therapy. Patients with Wilson's disease crisis commonly present with fulminant hepatic failure, severe DAT-negative hemolytic anemia, and multiple organ failure with rapid clinical deterioration. Eventually, many patients require a liver transplant. In this context, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been used to remove copper and bridge to liver transplantation. Most studies describing plasma exchange in Wilson's disease have been case reports. Here we report on the experience gained through the ASFA apheresis registry on Wilson's disease. Methods: The ASFA apheresis registry study is a multi-center registry study. Both prospective and retrospective data are permitted in the registry, the latter including data collection up to January 2000. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data collection tools hosted at Children's National Health System. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based application to support data capture for research studies. The registry contains patient demographic and clinical data, apheresis procedure information, treatment plan, and treatment outcome/complications. All participating sites had received approval from the ASFA Apheresis Registry Subcommittee of the ASFA Application Committee, as well as from local IRBs. Results: To date, a total of 10 patients (three men and seven women) with Wilson's disease treated between 2005 and 2013 have been included in this study. The median age of initial diagnosis was 16 years (range 6-30 years). The median age at first TPE was 17 years (range 6-61 years). Patients underwent a total of 43 TPEs, with most patients requiring an intensive TPE session. The mean number of TPE procedures was 3.5 (range 1-9). Except for one patient who received a TPE prior to the patient's transfer to the study site, no patient received a TPE prior to the TPE of the first registry study. All TPEs used ACD-A as anticoagulation, 98% (42/43) TPEs targeted 1-1.25 plasma volumes, and 95% (41/43) TPEs were performed with 100% fluid balance. A central TPE catheter was placed in all patients. After TPE, 90% (9/10) of patients underwent liver transplantation, all 10 patients (both transplanted and non-transplanted) have a survival of at least 6 months.

1466,Outcome and development of symptoms after orthotopic liver transplantation in Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive copper storage disease that results in hepatic and neurological dysfunction. Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for fulminant cases in patients with chronic liver disease. Reports of the outcome of neuropsychiatric symptoms after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) are limited. Aim: To study the course of neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms after liver transplantation in Wilson's disease Methods: Nineteen patients with Wilson's disease received liver transplantation and were prospectively followed from 2005 to 2010 for the development of hepatic, neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Results: Eight patients (all female) were transplanted for acute liver failure and eleven patients for chronic liver failure. Patient survival rates at one and five years post-transplant were 78% and 65%, respectively. Of the surviving patients, liver symptom scores improved in all patients and neurological symptom scores improved in all but one patient after OLT compared to baseline and compared to pre-OLT status. Psychiatric symptoms showed moderate improvements. Conclusion: Survival after OLT in Wilson's disease with end-stage liver disease is excellent. Overall, neuropsychiatric symptoms improved after transplantation, supporting arguments for expanding the indication for liver transplantation in patients with symptomatic neurological Wilson disease and stable liver function. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

1467,"Iron, zinc and copper in the physiology and disease of the retina","The essential trace metals iron, zinc and copper play an important role both in physiology and in diseases of the retina. They are involved in various retinal functions such as phototransduction, the visual cycle and the process of neurotransmission, being tightly bound to proteins and other molecules to regulate their structure and/or function, or as unbound free metal ions. Elevated levels of “free” or loosely bound metal ions can exert toxic effects and to maintain homeostatic levels to protect retinal cells from their toxicity there are appropriate mechanisms such as metal transporters, chaperones and the presence of certain storage molecules bind metals to non-toxic products to build. The pathways for maintaining homeostatic metal levels are closely related, with different metabolic pathways directly and/or indirectly affecting their concentrations, compartmentalization, and oxidation/reduction states. Retinal deficiency or excess of these metals can result from systemic depletion and/or overload or from mutations in genes involved in maintaining retinal metal homeostasis and is associated with retinal dysfunction and pathology. Iron accumulation in the retina, a hallmark of aging, may be involved in the pathogenesis of retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Zinc deficiency is associated with poor dark adaptation. Zinc levels in the human retina and RPE decrease with age in AMD. Copper deficiency is associated with optic neuropathy, but retinal function is preserved. The changes in iron and zinc homeostasis in AMD have led to speculation that iron chelation and/or zinc supplements may aid in treatment. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,"Ugarte, M.;Osborne, N. N.;Brown, L.

1468,Wilson's disease. [Czech],"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which copper accumulates in tissues, particularly the liver and brain. The genetic defect affects the P-type ATPase gene (ATP7B). More than 500 mutations that cause Wilson's disease have been described. The most common mutation in Central Europe affects H1069Q. Symptoms of Wilson disease include hepatic or neurological disorders. The liver condition manifests as steatosis, acute or chronic hepatitis, or cirrhosis. The neurological diseases usually manifest themselves from the age of 20 as motor disorders (tremor, speech and writing disorders), which can lead to a severe extrapyramidal syndrome with stiffness, dysarthria and muscle contractions. Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory findings (neurological symptoms, liver lesions, low ceruloplasmin, increased free serum copper, high urinary Cu concentrations, Kayser-Fleischer ring). Diagnosis is confirmed by high levels of Cu in liver tissue or by genetic evidence. Left untreated, Wilson's disease leads to the patient's death. With proper treatment, the survival rate is approximately the same as that of the normal population. Treatment involves either removing copper from the body by chelating agents that are excreted in the urine (penicillamine, trientine) or limiting copper absorption from the gut and reducing copper toxicity (zinc, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate). In the Czech Republic, penicillamine or zinc is used. Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with fulminant liver failure or decompensated liver cirrhosis.

1470,Wilson's disease in offspring of affected patients: reports from four French families,"Background: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene that lead to toxic accumulation of copper mainly in the liver and brain. Early treatment can prevent irreversible tissue damage. Aim: We report four families with two consecutive generations of WM to emphasize the need to screen offspring of affected parents. Results: All families were known to have had WM in one parent. Children from two families were not screened for the disease until there was liver disease in one and neurological symptoms in the other. In two other families, screening children as soon as diagnosis was made in the affected parent allowed timely rescue of advanced liver disease in one, while two affected children were asymptomatic. In three children, the diagnosis required direct sequencing of the ATP7B gene. Two new disease-causing mutations are reported. Conclusion: Patients with WM should be offered genetic counseling when contemplating pregnancy and the offspring should always be screened for the disease. Diagnostic difficulties due to copper disorders in asymptomatic children who are obligate Wilson gene carriers and the utility of molecular diagnostics are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.",,"Dufernez, F.;Lachaux, A.;Chappuis, P.;De Lumley, L.;Bost, M.;Woimant, F.;Misrahi, M.;Debray, D.",2013,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinre.2013.01.001,0,0,

1472,Recent advances in the treatment of chorea,"Treating patients with chorea, particularly Huntington's disease, is a complex task that requires skills in a number of areas. This paper summarizes new findings on this topic and places them in the context of established methods. It focuses on Huntington's disease, as this is the disease for which the most publications on management have been published in recent years. Treatment begins with an appropriate diagnosis and differential diagnosis with the aim of finding diseases with chorea that are amenable to causal treatment. The importance of genetic testing and genetic counseling is emphasized, as is the importance of closely monitoring the course of the disease in order to tailor appropriate therapies. The pharmacological treatment is based on scant evidence, but in large part on the expertise of centers dedicated to caring for patients with HD. It mainly focuses on motor and psychiatric aspects of the phenotype. Non-pharmacological treatment is important and is best provided in a multidisciplinary care setting. © The author(s), 2013.",,"Burgunder, J.

1473,"Repurposing as an orphan drug development strategy, evidence from European approvals","Introduction: The increased awareness of the value of drug reuse has led to a number of initiatives to make discarded drug candidates available for screening. It has been suggested that repurposing is of significant utility in identifying drugs used to treat orphan diseases. The 78 orphan drugs approved in Europe provide a useful repository for analyzing evidence of repurposing. Areas covered: Orphan medicines authorized in Europe have been classified as misused, medicines specifically developed for orphan indications, or medicines classified as orphan medicines after their usefulness has been established. Drugs have also been classified as novel medicinal entities, biological products, and natural products. The majority (60%) of approvals were for novel medicines, including 17 of the 19 approved biological products. Natural products provided 10 of the approved drugs, while 30 (38%) of the approvals were drugs repurposed from other indications. Expert Opinion: Identifying drugs to treat rare diseases requires cost-effective research approaches. As the prevalence or incidence of the disease decreases, the need for more cost-effective approaches becomes more important. The systematic use of reuse offers better opportunities to achieve such goals and may facilitate the subsequent development of the resulting drug(s). © InformaUK,Ltd.",,"Norman, P.",2013,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1517/21678707.2013.796883,0,0,
1474,Liver diseases during pregnancy: diseases that do not only occur during pregnancy,"Pregnancy is a unique clinical condition with several normal physiological changes affecting body organs including the liver. Liver disease can result in significant morbidity and mortality in both pregnant women and their infants. Faced with such physiological changes, few challenges arise to make an accurate diagnosis. Laboratory test results should be interpreted carefully, and knowing what normal changes to expect is prudent to avoid clinical misjudgment. Other challenges relate to treatment methods and their safety for mother and child. This overview summarizes liver diseases that do not only occur during pregnancy. We focus on viral hepatitis and its modes of transmission, diagnosis, implications for pregnancy, the mother, the child, treatment and breastfeeding. Autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, Wilson's disease, Budd Chiari disease, and portal vein thrombosis in pregnancy are also discussed. Pregnancy is rare in patients with cirrhosis because of the metabolic and hormonal changes associated with cirrhosis. Variceal bleeding can occur in up to 38% of pregnant women with cirrhosis. The management of portal hypertension during pregnancy is discussed. Pregnancy increases pathogenicity, which leads to an increase in the rate of gallstones. We discuss some of the procedures for gallstones in pregnancy when symptoms appear. Finally, we review some options for treating liver adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma during pregnancy. © 2013 Baishideng Publishing Group Co.,Limited. All rights reserved.",,"Almashhrawi, A.

1475,Update on Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of chronic copper toxicosis characterized by excessive copper deposition in the body, mainly in the liver and brain. It is a progressive disease and fatal if left untreated. Excessive copper accumulation results from the liver's inability to excrete copper into the bile. Copper is an essential trace metal and plays a crucial role in many metabolic processes. Almost all body copper is protein bound. In WD, the slow but unrelenting accumulation of copper overwhelms the copper chaperones (copper-binding proteins), resulting in high levels of free copper and copper-induced tissue injury. The liver is the central organ for copper metabolism and copper is initially accumulated in the liver but over time migrates to other tissues. WD has proteic clinical manifestations mainly due to liver, brain and osseomuscular impairments. The diagnosis of WD is challenging and is based on a combination of clinical features and laboratory tests. The identification of various high frequency mutations identified in various population studies around the world has revived interest in developing DNA chips for the rapid genetic diagnosis of WD. All symptomatic and all pre-symptomatic patients require lifelong decopping with careful clinical monitoring. Decoppering ensures that pre-symptomatic individuals remain symptom-free. With sensible decopping, even patients with severe neurological impairment improve and can return to normal life and resume school or work on an equal footing with their peers. Treatment regimens and patient follow-up using the WD-specific Global Assessment Scale for WD (GAS for WD) are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,"Aggarwal, A.;Bhatt, M.",2013,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-410502-7.00014-4,0,0,
1476,Stagnant Loop Syndrome: A rare cause of severe malabsorption,"Background: Bacterial overgrowth of the gut secondary to postoperative anatomical abnormalities and other small bowel diseases can lead to malabsorption. Case report: A patient had multiple abdominal surgeries due to recurrent intestinal obstruction. She initially presented with severe megaloblastic anemia. As a result, she suffered from weight loss, diarrhea, edema, recurrent anemia (despite vitamin B12 substitution) and severe malabsorption of proteins, lipids, iron and vitamins. Vague details of the surgeries performed, difficult to interpret intestinal anatomy, and unusual cholestasis complicated the diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth due to stagnation loop syndrome. Treatment with antibiotics improved the patient's condition only temporarily. After restoration of intestinal continuity and after resection of an enteroenteric fistula and an intestinal conglomerate, the patient showed no further symptoms. Conclusion: This patient's medical history indicates that the diagnosis of stagnation loop syndrome can be difficult. The primary goal in relation to surgically induced small bowel bacterial overgrowth should be correction of the underlying small bowel abnormality whenever possible. © 2013 S.

1480,"Metabolism of triethylenetetramine and 1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadodecane by the spermidine/spermine N<sup>1</sup>-acetyltransferase and thialysine acetyltransferase","Triethylenetetramine (TETA; Syprine; Merck Rahway, NJ), a drug for Wilson's disease, is a copper chelator and a low-charge analog of polyamine spermidine. We recently showed that TETA is metabolized in vitro to its monoacetylated derivative (MAT) by the polyamine-catabolic enzyme spermidine/spermine-N<sup>1</sup>-acetyltransferase (SSAT1) and by thialysine acetyltransferase (SSAT2). . TETA acetylation is increased in SSAT1-overexpressing mice compared to wild-type mice. However, SSAT1-deficient mice metabolize TETA at the same rate as wild-type mice, suggesting the existence of a different N-acetylase responsible for its metabolism in mice. Here we show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of SSAT2 in HEPG2 cells and in primary hepatocytes of SSAT1-deficient or wild-type mice reduced the metabolism of TETA to MAT. In contrast, 1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadodecane (SpmTrien), a charge-poor spermine analogue, was an extremely poor substrate of human recombinant SSAT2 and was metabolized by SSAT1 in HEPG2 cells and in wild-type primary hepatocytes. Thus, despite the similar structures of TETA and SpmTriene, SSAT2 is the main acetylator of TETA, while SpmTriene is mainly acetylated by SSAT1.

1481,"Urinary excretion of copper, zinc and iron with and without D-penicillamine administration in relation to hepatic copper concentration in dogs","Hereditary copper-associated hepatitis in dogs is similar to Wilson's disease, a copper accumulation disease in humans. Values for urinary copper excretion are well established in the diagnostic protocol of Wilson's disease, while these have not been evaluated in dogs. The aims of this study were to characterize both basal and D-penicillamine-induced urinary copper, zinc and iron excretion in dogs in relation to hepatic copper concentration. Beagles, Beagle-Bedlington terrier crossbreeds homozygous for the COMMD1 gene mutation that causes copper toxicity, and Labrador retrievers with normal or elevated hepatic copper levels were studied. The hepatic copper phenotype was determined by histological evaluation of liver biopsies and measurement of hepatic copper concentration by instrumental neutron activation analysis. The urinary excretion of copper, iron and zinc was measured by optical emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma under basal conditions and after oral administration of a single dose (20 mg/kg body weight) of the chelating agent D-penicillamine. After administration of D-penicillamine, there was a rapid increase in the urinary excretion of copper and zinc, but not iron. This increase was not different in dogs with high or normal hepatic copper concentrations. D-penicillamine-induced urinary copper excretion and copper/creatinine ratio did not correlate with hepatic copper concentrations in the studied dogs, although basal urinary copper/zinc ratios correlated with hepatic copper concentrations in Labrador retrievers. The latter parameter may be useful in diagnostic and follow-up protocols for copper-associated hepatitis in Labrador retrievers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Fieten, H.;Hugen, S.;van den Ingh, T. S. G. A.

1492,Novel bioimaging techniques of metals by laser ablation mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma for the diagnosis of fibrotic and cirrhotic liver diseases,"Background and Aims: Inherited disorders related to metal overload or unwanted toxic accumulation of heavy metals can lead to morbidity and mortality. For example, patients with hereditary hemochromatosis or Wilson's disease may develop severe hepatic pathologies, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. While relevant disease genes are identified and genetic testing is applicable, liver biopsy combined with metal detection techniques such as energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) is still used to accurately diagnose metals. Conversely, several metals are required in trace amounts to perform vital functions, and their deficiency due to rapid growth, pregnancy, excessive blood loss, and inadequate nutritional or digestive intake leads to organic and systemic deficiencies. Established in situ techniques such as EDX radiation spectroscopy are not sensitive enough to analyze the distribution of trace metals and quantification of metal images is difficult. Methods: In this study, we developed a quantitative biometal imaging technique of human liver tissue by inductively coupled plasma laser ablation mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to determine the distribution of selected metals in cryosections from healthy and fibrotic/cirrhotic liver. Results: Most metals are homogeneously distributed in normal tissues, while in fibrotic livers they are rerouted, leading to significant metal deposition. In addition, total iron and copper concentrations in diseased livers were found to be approximately 3-5 times higher than in normal liver samples. Conclusions: Biometal imaging by LA-ICP-MS is a sensitive innovative diagnostic tool that will impact clinical practice in identifying and assessing hepatic metal abnormalities and detecting subtle metal variations during ongoing hepatic fibrogenesis. © 2013 MM et al.",,"M-M, P.;Weiskirchen, R.;Gassler, N.;Bosserhoff, A.

1496,Copper phenotype in Alzheimer's disease: dissecting the signaling pathway,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the basis for the onset and progression of the disease. Unfortunately, none of these seem to explain the complexity of the pathogenesis. Indeed, several and independent pathogenetic pathways can be disrupted simultaneously, and each contributes to the disease etiology. In recent years, researchers have started to study biometals in more detail. A number of studies have shown that metal dyshomoostasis can exacerbate the onset and progression of AD. In particular, various authors have hypothesized that changes in metal metabolism are associated with increased metal-related oxidative stress and the formation and precipitation of beta-amyloid oligomers. Studies performed in vivo, in vitro, in living patients, and in silico studies have shown that local and systemic defects in copper metabolism are hallmarks of AD. This strongly supports the hypothesis that copper pathways may be disrupted by the disease. More specifically, a copper phenotype for AD can be proposed based on defects found in genes involved in copper metabolism. In this review article, we describe copper dyshomeostasis in AD patients and attempt to explain the basics of the AD copper phenotype. By dissecting copper pathways, we highlight mechanisms that may underlie the disease. We also discuss various related translation results. Copyright © 2013 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

1498,Neurochemical and behavioral characteristics of toxic milk mice: An animal model of Wilson's disease,"Poisonous milk mice have an inherited defect in copper metabolism. The hepatic phenotype of toxic milk mice resembles the clinical findings in humans suffering from Wilson's disease (WND). In the present study, the neurotransmitter system and locomotor performance in toxic milk mice were examined to verify the feasibility of this animal model for studying the neuropathology of WND. Mice aged 2 and 12 months were used in the experiment. Mice were tested according to rotarod and footprint protocols. The monoamine content in brain structures was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. To detect neuronal loss, the expression of enzymes specific to dopaminergic [tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)], noradrenergic (dopamine-beta-hydroxylase) and serotonergic [tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)] neurons were analyzed by Western blot. The 12-month-old toxic milk mice showed impaired locomotor performance in behavioral tests. Motor deficits were accompanied by increased levels of copper and serotonin in various brain regions and a slight decrease in dopamine concentration in the striatum. The expression of TH, dopamine beta-hydroxylase and TPH in the different brain structures did not differ between toxic milk mice and control animals. Despite the differences in brain pathology between humans and rodents, further research into neuronal damage in toxic milk mice is warranted to advance the understanding of neuropathology in WND. © 2013 The author(s).",,"Przybylkowski, A.;Gromadzka, G.;Wawer, A.;Bulska, E.;Jablonka-Salach, K.;Grygorowicz, T.;Schnejder-Pacholek, A.;Czlonkowski, A.",2013,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11064-013-1111-3,0,0,
1499,Überwachung der Therapie bei Morbus Wilson durch den oralen Radiokupfertest. [Germanium],"Background: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper transport that leads to inhibition of biliary copper excretion. Overloading of the metal, especially in the liver and basal ganglia, leads to hepatic, but also to extrapyramidal motor and psychiatric clinical symptoms. Depending on the stage of the disease, therapy with chelating agents and zinc is possible, but must be given for life without long interruptions. With early diagnosis and consistent treatment, the prognosis of Wilson's disease is excellent and the need for liver transplantation can usually be avoided. Treatment monitoring is essential because chelating penicillamine therapy is complicated by side effects, triene is not always available, and non-response to zinc therapy has been reported. Method: To evaluate the inhibition of enteral copper absorption, an oral radiocopper test was performed in our study in 58 patients with Wilson's disease. Patients received 10 MBq <sup>64</sup>Cu and serum radioactivity was measured one and three hours after ingestion. A total of 91 tests were evaluated. Results: In 1 patient, no inhibition of copper absorption was found under penicillamine therapy. A partial inhibition of enteral resorption could be demonstrated for triene in 6 patients. 48 tests showed sufficient inhibition by zinc therapy. In 36 tests of the patients taking zinc, the inhibition turned out to be insufficient. In 6 of them it was improved by increasing the dosage. In this test, it was shown that triene also inhibits the absorption of copper. No inhibition is observed with penicillamine. Conclusion: The high prevalence of insufficient efficacy of zinc therapy requires continuous monitoring. The radiocopper test allows an assessment of the influence of zinc on copper absorption in Wilson's disease. Further studies need to be conducted to assess the usefulness of this test. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart. New York.",,"Gunther, P.;Kuhn, H.

1501,Long-term nutritional assessment in children with Wilson's disease. [Chinese],"Aim: To study the long-term nutritional status of children with Wilson's disease who were treated with different methods. METHODS: Fifteen children with Wilson's disease were followed up for anthropometric measurements (height and body weight), determination of blood biochemistry parameters (blood routine, liver function, blood calcium and blood phosphorus), and determination of bone mineral density. The children were divided into a penicillamine group and a penicillamine + zinc sulfate group based on the therapies, and comparisons between two groups were made. Results: Of the 15 children, one had stunted growth and the other had moderate malnutrition. There was no significant difference between two groups (P>0.05). There were 3 children with mild anemia in the penicillamine group and 1 child with mild anemia in the penicillamine+zinc sulfate group. Alkaline phosphatase levels in children in the penicillamine group were higher than normal with the exception of two children. Blood calcium was increased in 1 child in the penicillamine group. The mean tibia and distal radius BMD Z-scores were -3 and -3.5, respectively, in 1 child in the penicillamine group, which were lower than normal values. There was no significant difference in hemoglobin, total protein, albumin, blood calcium, blood phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and the ratio of mid-tibia to distal radius bone density between two groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Children with Wilson's disease have normal nutritional status after prolonged copper replacement and a low-copper diet.

1502,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic, autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism. The ATP<inf>7</inf>B gene encodes a copper carrier that transports copper from hepatocytes to the bile as well as ceruloplasmin copper incorporation. WM can present between the ages of 4 and 12 with almost any type of liver disease, or with neurological and psychiatric symptoms in adolescence. Less commonly, hemolysis and/or fulminant hepatic failure may be an initial presentation. Low plasma ceruloplasmin, a positive penicillamine challenge test, and high hepatic copper suggest the diagnosis. Molecular methods help diagnose WD. If diagnosed early, it is treatable with chelators and/or zinc and has a good prognosis. Fulminant liver disease has a poor outcome without transplantation.",,"Perisic, V. N.",2013,,,0,0,

This study was not a specific research project but a retrospective analysis of 321 patients with Wilson's disease treated between 1949 and 2000. All investigations were performed in the best interests of diagnosing and treating patients referred to my clinic. The delay in diagnosis in 18 cases resulted in progression to severe liver disease in 14 cases and neurological disease in 4 cases. One patient had no symptoms at the time her sister's disease was diagnosed as Wilson's disease. A second patient with liver disease was also diagnosed when a nurse was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. There was a female to male ratio of 15:7. The mean age at diagnosis was 12.6 years and the incidence was 6.9%. The delay in diagnosis resulted in nine deaths. Three patients at the end of the series were enrolled in the acute phase, two women and one man; of these two responded to chelation therapy, the third required a liver transplant. The hemolysis appeared to be extravascular, and possible mechanisms of hemolysis are discussed. © The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Physicians.

1505,Therapy of systemic metabolic disorders based on the detection of basic corneal markers in childhood. [German],"Many systemic lysosomal storage diseases already show basic corneal opacities in childhood. The lysosome is a cell organelle produced by the Golgis apparatus, surrounded by a membrane and containing hydrolytic enzymes that break down food molecules, particularly proteins and other complex molecules. The exact diagnosis of the corneal opacity by the ophthalmologist using the slit lamp can show the correct interpretation of the specific lysosomal storage disorder. It is very important to diagnose such diseases as soon as possible, since today the development of systemic enzymatic therapies has expanded the therapeutic toolbox for the current standard of care. The following corneal landmarks of systemic storage diseases and modern systemic therapy are presented: cornea verticillata in Fabrys disease, periodic infusion of alpha-galactosidase a; Kayser-Fleischers ring for Wilson's disease, zinc, trienetin, low-copper diet; multiple, punctiform crystals in cystinosis, cysteamine, Raptor RP 103 (DR-cysteamine), which reduces cytotoxicity through continuous dissolution of cystine from lysosomes, kidney transplantation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; peripheral ring but no true lipid arc and moderate stromal opacities in LCAT deficiency, injection of recombinant enzyme or of encapsulated LCAT-secreting cells; diffuse stromal opacity in mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). Enzyme replacement therapy is currently indicated for MPS I, MPS II and MPS VI, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; painful, bilateral pseudodendritic opacities in tyrosinemia type II (eponym: Richner-Hanhart syndrome), low-phenylalanine and low-tyrosine diet lead to the complete disappearance of the corneal changes with a consecutive pain-free phase. A strict diet throughout life is necessary to prevent corneal recurrence and the occurrence of palmo-plantar keratoses. Such therapies can enable the patient to lead an otherwise normal life for decades. © 2013 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

1506,D-penicillamine treatment of copper-associated hepatitis in Labrador retrievers,"D-penicillamine is used effectively for the lifelong treatment of copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers and Wilson's disease in humans. A complex form of copper-associated hepatitis has recently been characterized in Labrador retrievers. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with D-penicillamine in copper-associated hepatitis in this breed, to investigate the effects on hepatic concentrations of copper, iron and zinc, and to evaluate parameters predicting the optimal duration of treatment. Forty-three client-owned Labrador Retrievers diagnosed with elevated liver copper levels were treated with D-penicillamine and underwent at least one follow-up examination, including a liver biopsy for histopathological evaluation of inflammatory lesions. Copper, iron and zinc concentrations in the liver were determined in the initial and follow-up biopsies by instrumental neutron activation analysis. The influence of initial hepatic copper concentration, gender, age, d-penicillamine formulation and the occurrence of side effects were examined for their influence on hepatic copper concentration after a certain treatment period by generalized mixed modelling. D-penicillamine was shown to be effective in reducing hepatic copper concentration and associated inflammatory lesions. Parameters derived from the model can be used to estimate the necessary duration of D-penicillamine treatment for Labrador Retrievers with elevated hepatic copper concentration. Continuous, lifelong treatment with D-penicillamine is not recommended in this breed due to the risk of copper and zinc deficiency in the liver. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Fieten, H.;Dirksen, K.;van den Ingh, T.

1507,Astrocytic functions in brain copper homeostasis,"Copper is an essential element that is required for a variety of important cell functions. Since not only a copper deficiency, but also a copper excess can severely impair cell functions, the cellular copper metabolism is strictly regulated. In the brain, astrocytes appear to play a central role in copper metabolism. With their strategically important location between capillary endothelial cells and neuronal structures, they are ideally positioned to transport copper from the blood-brain barrier to parenchymal brain cells. Accordingly, astrocytes have the ability to efficiently take up, store, and export copper. Cultured astrocytes appear to be remarkably resistant to copper-induced toxicity. However, exposure to copper can lead to profound changes in the metabolism of these cells. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge on copper metabolism in astrocytes, describes copper-induced changes in glucose and glutathione metabolism in astrocytes, and discusses the possible role of astrocytes in brain copper metabolism in related diseases and disorders of brain copper homeostasis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in rare cases, symptoms can worsen even when WD is treated. Here we report a case of unusual neurological deterioration during decupuration therapy in WM. Case Report: A 28-year-old man was diagnosed with WM 13 years prior to his clinical visit; however, its drug compliance has been poor over the years. He was treated with trientine for tremors and dysarthria in recent years. However, dysarthria and dystonia developed in his limbs, worse on the right side, and had worsened despite good medication for several weeks. His symptoms varied. It was initially misdiagnosed as dystonia; However, it turned out to be a seizure due to cortical degeneration. These symptoms were completely resolved with antiepileptic drugs. In addition, the cortical enhancement of bifrontal degeneration on MRI has disappeared. Conclusion: This case presented an unusual epileptic neurological deterioration due to cortical degeneration during decupuration therapy. Seizures in WD can easily be mistaken for part of dystonia. However, the fluctuating symptoms indicate a seizure. © 2013 Kim et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Kim, Y. E.;Yun, J. Y.;Yang, H. J.;Kim, H. J.;Jeon, B.

1516,Wilson's disease: Alterations in methionine metabolism and inflammation affect global DNA methylation in early liver disease,"Hepatic methionine metabolism may play an essential role in the regulation of methylation status and liver injury in Wilson disease (WD) through copper (Cu) inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) and the resulting accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAW). We examined the transcript levels of selected genes associated with liver damage, the levels of SAHH, SAH, DNA methyltransferase genes (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b) and global DNA methylation in the tx-j mouse (tx-j), a Animal model by WD. The results were compared to those in control C3H mice and in response to Cu-chelation by penicillamine (PCA) and dietary supplementation with the methyl donor betaine to modulate inflammatory and methylation status. Transcript levels of selected genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipid synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation were downregulated in tx-j mice at baseline, further downregulated in response to PCA, and showed little to no response to betaine. Hepatic Sahh transcript and protein levels were decreased in tx-j mice, leading to an increase in SAH levels. Hepatic Cu accumulation was associated with inflammation as indicated by histopathology and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and liver tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf-alpha) levels. Dnmt3b was downregulated in tx-j mice along with global DNA hypomethylation. PCA treatment of tx-j mice reduced Tnf-alpha and ALT levels, betaine treatment increased S-adenosylmethionine and upregulated Dnmt3b levels, and both treatments restored global DNA methylation levels. Conclusion: Reduced hepatic Sahh expression was associated with increased liver SAH levels in the tx-j model of WD, with consequent global DNA hypomethylation. Increased global DNA methylation has been achieved by reducing inflammation through Cu chelation or by providing methyl groups. We propose that increased SAH levels and inflammation affect the widespread epigenetic regulation of gene expression in WD. © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",,"Medici, V.;Shibata, N.

1521,Efficacy and safety of oral chelating agents in the treatment of patients with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wilson disease is a genetic copper storage disease causing hepatic and neurological symptoms. Chelating agents (D-penicillamine, trientine) are used as first-line therapies for symptomatic patients, but data from large cohorts are scarce. We evaluated the safety of therapy with D-penicillamine and trientine and the outcomes in patients with Wilson's disease. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 380 patients with Wilson's disease from tertiary care centers in Germany and Austria and 25 additional patients from the EUROWILSON registry. Chelator-based treatment regimens were analyzed for their effect on neurological and hepatic symptoms and on adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (Kaplan-Meier estimate; data were collected for a mean of 13.3 years after the start of treatment). RESULTS: Changes in medication were frequent, leading to an analysis of 471 chelator monotherapies (326 patients received D-penicillamine and 141 received trientine). Nine of 326 patients treated with D-penicillamine and 3 of 141 patients treated with trientine underwent liver transplantation. Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation occurred more frequently in those receiving D-penicillamine than trientine (p=0.039). Forty-eight months after therapy, worsening liver function was reported in only 4 of 333 patients initially treated with a chelating agent. Hepatic improvements were observed in more than 90% and neurological improvements in more than 55% of treatment-naïve patients, and the values did not differ significantly between treatments. However, neurological deterioration was observed less frequently in patients who were first given D-penicillamine (6 out of 295) than in those who were first given trientine (4 out of 38; p=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Chelation therapy is an effective therapy for most patients with Wilson's disease; D-penicillamine and trientine lead to comparable results, although D-penicillamine showed a higher rate of side effects. A few patients receiving chelation therapy experienced neurological deterioration, which was more common in patients receiving trientine. © 2013 AGA Institute.",,"Weiss, K.

Case Report: The patient was a 15-year-old boy who had been seen by several gastroenterologists for dysphagia and sialorrhea. He was prescribed various medications. Upper gastrointestinal radiography and two endoscopies were performed. After all clinical manifestations, low serum ceruloplasmin, low copper, high 24-hour copper excretion and Kayser-Fleischer rings led to the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Treatment with D-penicillamine was started. Dysphagia was cured after a few days of treatment. The neurological symptoms improved after two weeks of treatment.

1526,Clinical approach to Wilson's disease using the Leipzig scoring system,"INTRODUCTION: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper accumulation and toxicity. It is treatable if diagnosed early. Recognition is clear in typical clinical presentations. Unexplained abnormalities in liver tests are diagnostically challenging and require further investigation. OBJECTIVES & METHODS: Aim: To study the clinical features and diagnostic possibilities in WM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From June 2010 to March 2013, 63 patients with WM (22 females, 41 males) who were between 18 and 64 years old at the end of the analysis were analyzed. The Leipzig scoring system was used for diagnosis. RESULTS: Patients were followed up from 3 months to 21 years after diagnosis. The diagnosis was based on clinical suspicion and findings, parameters of copper metabolism, ultrasound, ophthalmological examination, liver biopsy, MRI, DNA analysis and assessment of the Leipzig scoring system at the final assessment. Twenty-seven patients (42.9%) had only liver disease, thirty-one (49.2%) - with hepatic and neurological presentation, three with neurological features without signs of liver damage, and two asymptomatic patients. The hepatic presentation was as follows: steatosis (4/63), hepatitis 38.1% (24/63), cirrhosis in 47.6% (30/53), acute liver failure after treatment discontinuation (2/63), hepatocellular Carcinoma in a patient with cirrhosis. The average ceruloplasmin content was 0.137 g/l. Copper in the 24-hour urine was increased. The D-penicillamine provocation test showed a mean value of 17.69 µmol/24 h copper excretion in the urine. According to the Leipzig diagnostic criteria, 55 (87.3%) patients had a score >=4 (max. 12). Eight patients had a score of 3, but the exclusion of another etiology and the clinical course of the disease confirmed the diagnosis. 23 (36.5%) patients had a Kayser-Fleischer ring and 4 - sunflower cataract. Liver biopsy was performed in 23 patients, with rodamine-positive staining in 9. DNA analysis was performed in 54 patients and mutations were found in 26 (48.1%). CONCLUSION: WD is a treatable inherited disease. In liver diseases, care must be taken not to delay the detection and progression of the copper metabolism disorder. Our experience confirms that the Leipzig scoring system with a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters of copper metabolism, genetic testing and liver biopsy is useful for diagnosing WM in clinical practice.",,"Gancheva, D.;Atanassova, M.;Stamboliyska, M.;Kotzev, I.;Kaneva, M.",2013,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2050640613502900,0,0,
1527,<sup>99m</sup>Tc-mebrofenine scintigraphy to assess liver function in patients with Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by decreased biliary copper excretion and defective incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin, resulting in copper accumulation primarily in the liver, brain, and kidneys. Clinical manifestations associated with hepatic copper accumulation include liver disease ranging from mild hepatitis to acute liver failure or cirrhosis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether <sup>99m</sup>Tc-mebrofenine dynamic hepatobiliary scintigraphy (DHBS) can be used to assess liver function in WD. Materials and Methods We studied 37 consecutive zinc and/or penicillamine-treated WM patients (18 males and 19 females; mean age 39+/-4 years) with clinical signs of liver disease. All patients underwent standardized biochemical liver function tests including ALT, AST, GGT, AP, TOT BIL, ALB, serum copper and ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper excretion and DHBS with <sup>99m</sup>Tc mebrofenin. Liver biopsies were performed in all WM patients. Liver tissue was examined for routine liver histology (grading and staging of fibrosis) and liver copper content. DHBS acquisitions (30 sec/frame for 60 min) were obtained after an iv injection of 110 MBq <sup>99m</sup>Tc mebrofenine. Time-activity curves were recorded from regions of interest located over the liver parenchyma (H) and the common intrahepatic bile ducts (B). The times required to reach 50% of peak liver activity (50% HTmax), maximum liver activity (HTmax), and time to reach 50% of decrease in HTmax (HT<inf>1/2</inf>). , were: calculated. In addition, times at maximum biliary peak (BTmax) and halfway through peak activity (BT1/2) were calculated. Quantitative scintigraphic results were compared with biochemical parameters and liver histopathology. Results All patients had low levels of serum ceruloplasmin and copper (3.05 +/- 0.2 mg/dl and 57 +/- 18 mg/dl, respectively) and high 24-hour urinary copper excretion (201 +/ - 42 mg/24 hours). Based on Metavir fibrosis staging, 16 patients (43%) were classified as F1, 7 as F2 (19%), 8 as F3 (22%) and the remaining 6 as F4 (16%). Analysis of the quantitative data of DHBS showed slow hepatic uptake (>HTmax) and hepatobiliary clearance (>HT<inf>1/2</inf>) in almost all patients. A positive correlation between histological findings and 50% HTmax (p=0.004), HTmax (p=0.001), HT<inf>1/2</inf> (p=0.006) and BTmax (p= 0.02) values observed. In addition, a statistically significant correlation between 50% HTmax, HTmax, HT<inf>1/2</inf>, BTmax and high fibrosis grade (F4) compared to other fibrosis grades was found on multivariate analysis. With the exception of bilirubin (p<0.01), no correlation was found between biochemical liver function tests and DHBS parameters. Conclusions This study demonstrated the clinical utility of DHBS as a non-invasive diagnostic modality to assess the degree of liver fibrosis, allowing to reduce the number of liver biopsies in the long-term follow-up of WM patients.",,"Serra, A.;Sini, M.;Loi, G.

1528,Nanoparticle-based metal chelation therapy in animal models of diseases associated with copper toxicity,"Background: Animal models of Wilson's disease rarely show neurological impairment and accumulation of copper in the brain, hampering the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat neurological manifestations in patients with Wilson's disease. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate (1) the effects of intraperitoneally injected copper lactate (0.15 mg Cu/100 g body weight) daily for 90 days on copper and zinc levels in liver and brain tissue, biochemical parameters, and neurobehavioural functions in males, Wistar rats and (2) the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered D-penicillamine-encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles (NPs) for 90 days in copper-poisoned rats. Results: Copper-poisoned animals showed significantly reduced serum acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, increased expression of the hepatic MT-I gene, impairment of neuromuscular coordination and spatial memory together with a significant increase in liver copper content (99.1 %) and hippocampus (73%). ; and interestingly, 40.7% decrease and 77.1% increase in liver and hippocampal zinc content, respectively, compared to control rats. Massive grade 4 copper deposits and grade 1 copper-associated protein in hepatocytes of copper-poisoned rats were confirmed by rhodanine and orcein stains, respectively. Copper-poisoned rats showed swelling and an increase in the number of astrocytes with copper deposits in the choroid plexus. Degenerated neurons with pyknotic nuclei were also observed in brain slices from Cu-poisoned rats. Medium-sized (275 nm) and encapsulation efficiency (35 %) D-penicillamine NPs were synthesized. HPLC studies showed an increased concentration of D-penicillamine by NPs therapy compared to conventional D-penicillamine therapy in liver and brain tissue. NPs-based therapy resulted in a significant reduction in liver and brain copper levels with an improvement in neurological functions. Conclusion: The study provides the first in vivo evidence that D-penicillamine-encapsulated NPs can significantly reverse impairments from chronic copper poisoning in Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Badyal, R.

1530,Utility of zinc acetate treatment in 15 patients with childhood Wilson's disease: A single center experience,"Treatment of Wilson's disease is based on the use of copper chelators to promote copper excretion from the body or the use of zinc to decrease copper absorption in the ileum. Here we report the benefit of zinc acetate therapy in Wilson's disease in children. Fifteen patients, including 6 men and 9 women, were treated with zinc acetate. Before treatment, 6 patients received nothing, 5 were treated with penicillamine and 4 with trientine. Median liver function values measured at 0 months, 6 months and 1 year were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase 48, 35 and 33 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase 71, 25 and 46 IU/L; mu-glutamyl transpeptidase 49, 46 and 55 IU/l. The median point value of urinary copper was 1112 µg/L (0.15 µg/mg/creatinine) when using a chelating agent and 141 µg/L (0.10 µg/mg/creatinine) without using a chelating agent. Nausea developed in three patients and oral discomfort in one. This study demonstrates that zinc acetate therapy is an effective treatment for childhood onset of Wilson's disease.",,"Kondou, H.;Hasegawa, Y.;Tachibana, M.;Miyahara, Y.;Miyoshi, Y.;Hamada, Y.;Sakai, N.;Ozono, K.",2013,November,,0,1,
1531,"The promise of copper-lowering therapy with tetrathiomolybdate in the cure of advanced, previously incurable cancer and the treatment of inflammatory diseases","Tetrathiomolybdate(TM) complexes copper with protein in a potent three-part complex. This complex with dietary protein is excreted in the stool and causes a negative copper balance. In the blood, this complex of TM, free copper and albumin renders free copper unavailable and non-toxic. TM, developed for Wilson's disease, is very effective for neurological disorders for which no other drug is optimal. Lowering copper to mean levels with TM high enough to avoid clinical deficiency inhibits many cytokines, such as B. those that promote fibrotic, inflammatory, autoimmune diseases and cancer. TM is active in mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis and cirrhosis by inhibiting transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). TM is effective in mouse models of inflammatory diseases involving the liver and heart and in four mouse models of immune-modulated diseases. In humans, TM met both primary endpoints in a one-year randomized controlled trial in primary biliary cirrhosis, an autoimmune attack on the bile ducts. TM shows promise in the disease areas of fibrosis, inflammation and autoimmunity. Wherever steroids are useful, TM will be better and safer. Most excitingly, recent developments show that TM can cure advanced, previously incurable, metastatic cancer. Tumor growth requires angiogenesis (Folkman). Many angiogenic promoters are copper dependent, particularly those active at the micrometastatic cancer level. IMPORTANT NOTE: TM COMPLETELY INHIBITED CANCER GROWTH IN THE HER/2neu MOUSE GENETIC MAMMA CANCER MODEL. Microclusters of cancer cells still present after one year of TM therapy failed to grow due to lack of angiogenesis, while all controls had large cancer cells. Human trials ignored this advice and only tried TM against advanced cancer. These can recruit many promoters, many of which are non-copper dependent, and only modest effects in these studies have led to little interest. Now two US groups are curing metastatic cancer with TM using the mouse's cue. One group requires conventional suppression to no sign of disease (NED), although the disease is considered incurable due to micrometastasis. After three years of TM, the cancer is cured, with 10 different advanced metastatic cancers that have not yet been cured. The second group uses TM and conventional therapy from the beginning, as well as certain therapies that target the metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer, curing many patients with various metastatic cancers. We have initiated a randomized controlled trial of TM in micrometastatic osteosarcoma in dogs. It appears that TM can cure many previously hopeless cases of cancer.",,"Brewer, G.

1532,Zinc in human health: its discovery 50 years ago and the current implications,"The essentiality of zinc in humans was established in 1963. Enormous advances in both clinical and basic research into zinc metabolism in humans have been observed over the last 50 years. The main contributing factor to zinc deficiency is high intake of phytate grain protein in the developing world, and nearly 2 billion individuals may be zinc deficient. Conditional zinc deficiency has been observed in patients with malabsorption syndrome, liver disease, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell anemia, and other chronic conditions. The major clinical problems arising from zinc deficiency in humans include growth retardation; cell-mediated immune dysfunction and cognitive impairment. In the Middle East, zinc-deficient dwarfs lived no older than 25 years and died of intercurrent infections. In 1963 we only knew 3 enzymes that required zinc for their activities, but now we know >300 enzymes and >1000 transcription factors that are known to require zinc for their activities. Zinc is a second messenger of immune cells and intracellular free zinc in these cells is involved in signaling events. Zinc has been used very successfully as a therapeutic modality to treat acute diarrhea in children, Wilson's disease, the common cold, and to prevent blindness in patients with age-related dry macular degeneration, and is very effective in reducing the incidence of infection in the elderly. In addition to modulating cell-mediated immunity, zinc is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory.",,"Prasad, A. S.",2013,November,,0,0,
1533,Wilson's disease associated with pancreatitis,"14-year-old girl presented with a 1-month history of abdominal pain and bloating. A diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made and zinc acetate therapy was initiated. Associated pancreatitis was diagnosed at presentation based on elevated serum amylase and an enlarged pancreas on ultrasound. Thereafter, regular follow-up revealed no abdominal pain, with repeatedly normal serum amylase levels and a normal pancreas on ultrasound. Since abdominal pain at presentation is a common symptom in Wilson's disease, this possibility should be considered in untreated patients. It is concluded that pancreatitis may be associated with Wilson's disease, possibly because of copper deposition in the pancreas, and is likely to respond to copper chelation therapy.",,"Kumar, T. S.

1534,Hypocuremia-Associated Cytopenia and Myelopathy: A National Retrospective Review,"Background: Copper is an essential trace element involved in a number of important enzymatic processes throughout the body. Recent anecdotal reports and small studies have shown that copper deficiency can cause reversible hematological changes and irreversible neurological damage. Introduction: We chose to conduct a national study examining all cases of copper deficiency in Scotland over a 5 year period using information from a national reference laboratory. Results: Of 16 identified patients, we found that 86% had both hematological and neurological features of copper deficiency, while 18% had hematological features only at presentation. Twelve of the sixteen patients had high serum zinc concentrations (> 18 m/L) due to zinc-containing dental fixatives (9 patients), oral zinc replacement therapy after proximal bowel resection (1 patient), zinc-treated Wilson's disease (1 patient), and skin burns requiring topical zinc therapy required (1 patient). 94% of patients had haematological features as the first manifestation of copper deficiency, including anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Patients who subsequently underwent bone marrow examination had a presentation consistent with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, refractory anemia with proliferation of blast cells, unclassified marrow dysplasia, or probable myelodysplasia (MDS). 75% of patients had neurological symptoms or signs, including progressive walking difficulties and paraesthesia or gait difficulties without sensory signs. Clinical examination was consistent with spastic paraparesis (either with or without sensory neuropathy). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multifocal T2 hyperintense foci in the subcortical white matter, and atrophy of the cerebrum and cerebellum was also seen on computed tomography (CT). MRI of the spinal cord showed signal change in the dorsal columns in either the cervical or thoracic cord. 93% of cytopenias responded to copper supplementation and corrected the original cause of copper deficiency, but only 25% of patients showed improvement in their neurological function, while 33% worsened and 42% remained unchanged. Conclusions: Our study shows that copper deficiency is an underestimated cause of several types of cytopenia that are reversible but can lead to significant neurological damage if left untreated. We demonstrate the importance of identifying these patients early to prevent irreversible neurological damage.",,"Gabreyes, A.;Abbasi, H.;Forbes, K.

1535,Mixed-type polyneuropathy in Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal copper metabolism, predominantly affecting the central nervous system and liver. Peripheral nervous system involvement is rarely reported in association with WM and is not well characterized. Here we describe a WM patient with peripheral neuropathy. A 58-year-old man suffering from WD on treatment with trientine referred to our center because of mild distal extremity weakness with hypoesthesia. Clinical evaluation revealed mild leg weakness with foot drop and hyporreflexia. A nerve conduction study was performed using standard techniques (Medtronic Keypoint v5.09). Distal motor latency, F-wave latency, motor nerve conduction velocity, and CMAP were assessed in the deep peroneal, posterior tibial, median, and ulnar nerves; sensory nerve conduction velocity and SAP were measured in the sural, superficial peroneal, median, ulnar, and radial nerves. No other cause of the polyneuropathy was found. Electroneurographic findings indicated an asymmetrical, length-dependent, mixed-type sensorimotor neuropathy. We confirmed the involvement of the peripheral nervous system in WD. According to the literature, our findings also showed both myelin and axon damage. Despite treatment, polyneuropathy can occur, although iatrogenic involvement cannot be ruled out.",,"Aste, R.;Salaris, E.;Pische, M.

1536,Case Report: Brain MRI Demonstrating the Rare But Characteristic “Double Panda Sign” in a Patient With Wilson's Disease,"Background and purpose: Wilson disease is a clinically rare, important genetic disorder in which copper accumulates in the liver, brain, and other tissues and can be fatal if not recognized and treated symptomatically. Methods: A 29-year-old woman presented with painful left hand contractures, dysarthria, dysphagia, and gait disturbances. Symptoms had originally started 4 months earlier with right hand eversion and contracture for 2 weeks with spontaneous resolution. She denied exposure to toxins, drug abuse, or any similar family history. Results: She had normal mental status, dysarthria, hypophonia, dystonia, chorea and gait on a broad basis. Early Kayser-Fleisher rings were seen on ophthalmological examination. The diagnosis was confirmed with low serum ceruloplasmin and high urine copper. Liver function tests were normal. Brain MRI showed bilateral T2 hyperintensities involving the putamen, thalami and brainstem, with the characteristic ""double panda sign"". Conclusions: The ""double panda sign"" characteristic of Wilson's disease has been described in few reports. It is formed by the ""giant panda face"" in the midbrain [1] and the ""pygmy panda face"" in the pons [2] and is caused by the maintenance of normal signal intensity in the red nuclei and lateral plots reticulata of the substantia nigra, hypertinoinity in the tegmentum and hypointensity of the superior colliculus. The ""face of the toy panda"" is seen in the pontine tegmentum, delineated by a hypointensity of the medial longitudinal fasciculi and the central tegmental cords, in contrast to a hyperintensity of the cerebral aqueduct. She was treated with D-penicillamine, zinc, and a low-copper diet with slow improvement of symptoms.

1537,Hepatic Wilson disease outcome 6 months after diagnosis: response to a combination of D-pencillamine and zinc therapy in a tertiary care center in India,"Thirty-three prospectively enrolled cases of hepatic Wilson disease received D-pencillamine (10-20 mg/kg/day) and zinc therapy. The combination therapy (administered at intervals to avoid interference) was switched to zinc-only therapy after the transaminases had normalized. Normal transaminases and a negative copper balance after 12 months of therapy were considered successful therapy. The time to clinical and biochemical response (AST & ALT < 60 IU/L) was calculated. Thirty-three cases (mean age 127.21 +/- 42.27 months) were included. Liver transplantation (LT) was offered to 5 cases with fulminant liver failure. Of the remaining 28 chronic liver disease (CLD) cases: 4 of the 5 with acute chronic liver failure (ACLF) and 3 of the 17 decompensated CLD required LT. All 6 compensated CLD, 1 of 5 ACLF and 14 of 17 with decompensated CLD were successfully managed with medication. Twenty-one (75%) of the 28 cases were successfully treated with drug therapy. Twenty cases showed a clinical response within 6 months and 1 case at 12 months. Fifteen cases showed a biochemical reaction within 6 months and the remaining 6 cases after 12 months.

1538,Predicting a poor outcome of drug therapy at the time of diagnosis in Wilson's disease (WD) presenting as chronic liver disease (CLD): is the new Wilson's index helpful?,"Twenty-eight cases of WD presenting as CLD were treated with D pencillamine and zinc. Univariate and multivariate analyzes were performed to assess the association of risk factors with poor outcome (liver transplantation or death) at diagnosis. Four of 5 patients with acute chronic liver failure (ACLF), 3 of 17 patients with decompensated CLD had a poor outcome. All 6 compensated CLD, 1 of 5 ACLF and 14 of 17 with decompensated CLD improved. On univariate analysis, bilirubin, AST, ALT, Child-Pughs score, and New Wilson Index score were significantly higher in patients with poor outcomes. On logistic regression analysis, high ALT (adjusted OR 1.062, 95% CI 1.007-1.12, p=0.015) and low albumin (adjusted OR 0.052, 95% CI 0.005-0.56, p= 0.028) a significant association with a poor outcome. A 20 IU increase in ALT increased the odds ratio by 3.3 (95% CI: 1.15 to 9.58) and a 1 g decrease in albumin increased the odds ratio by 0.95 (95% CI: 0.44- 0.995). Conclusion: High ALT and low albumin are independently associated with poor response to drug therapy in WD presenting as CLD. The Child Pugh and New Wilson index scores showed no significant association with poor outcome.",,"Alam, S.;Khanna, R.;Sood, V.;Rawat, D.",2013,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10545-013-9633-z,0,0,
1539,Joint manifestation and bone changes in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that leads to pathological accumulation of copper in various organs, particularly the brain and liver. The most common clinical manifestations consist of the liver form and the neurological-psychiatric form. Joint problems are common and affect a high percentage of patients suffering from WD. Joint involvement in WM patients has not been studied in detail. Treatment of WD is very effective. One approach involves treatment with penicilamin. Alternatively, zinc can be used. The treatment must be lifelong. On the other hand, the treatment of arthropathy is difficult and usually not very successful. The aim was to determine the location and type of changes in the affected joints in a group of patients diagnosed with WM and to determine whether there is a relationship between the type of treatment and the joint manifestation. Objectives To evaluate changes in clinical and imaging assessments of patients with WM over a 5-year period. Methods From the group of 41 patients diagnosed with WM, a group of 10 patients with arthropathy was selected. Anamnesis, clinical findings, X-rays and sonography of the affected joints, bone density measurement of the hips and lumbar spine were evaluated. The full assessment was repeated after 5 years. Results The ages ranged from 19 to 61 years, the mean age was 36 years. There were 8 women and 2 men. The knee was the most commonly affected joint. Other joints affected (in descending order of frequency) were the wrist, shoulders, metacarpo-falangeal joints, ankles, and lumbosacral spine. Patients had involvement of 1-15 joints/patient. The physical findings consisted primarily of pain, pain on movement, stiffness, and crepitation in the affected joints. 5 patients had limited range of motion in abnormal joints and 2 had hypermobility. During a 5-year period, 5 patients had arthritis (established clinically and sonographically) lasting from 1 month to 2 years. Radiographic changes included joint space narrowing, osteophytes, cysts, soft tissue calcification, and bone fragmentation. 3 patients had osteoporosis and 3 osteopenia. After 5 years, in this group of patients, there is an increase in the number of affected joints, radiographic changes and a decrease in the T-score in the lumbar spine. More radiological changes are seen in patients treated with penicialamine than with zinc. Conclusions Wilson's disease is associated with morphological skeletal damage, premature osteoarthritis, arthritis and osteoporosis. Although all patients were treated with penicillamine or zinc and the neurological-psychiatric and hepatic manifestations were stable, the artropathy progressed. Patients taking penicilamin have other changes. Further studies with large numbers of patients are needed.",,"Sleglova, O.;Marecek, Z.",2013,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-eular.2083,0,0,

METHODS: 181 cases of Wilson's disease were retrospectively reviewed. Results: The male patients were significantly more than the female patients. The number of patients between the ages of 8 and 29 years was significantly higher than in other age periods. Liver and extrapyramidal symptoms were two main symptoms of onset. Liver function was impaired in 40-60% of patients. More than 95% of the patients had abnormal liver ultrasound, encephal CT and encephal MRI. Penicillamine was generally effective. The main cause of death was liver failure. Conclusion: Wilson's disease is common in males and adolescents. Hepatic and extrapyramidal symptoms are the main clinical features. Liver Ultrasound and Encephal CT/MRI should be one of the supporting diagnostic tools. Liver function was damaged prior to the onset of symptoms.

Methods: All WM patients (n = 35) referred to our center between 2000 and 2012 were retrospectively examined. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 16 years [range = 8-59] with 60% females. Five (14.3%) reported a positive history of parental consanguinity. Thirty-one (88.6%) patients presented with liver involvement only and 4 (11.4%) had mixed neurologic and hepatic involvement. Nine (25.7%) were fulminant WM, 14 (40%) chronic WM with hepatic decompensation, and 12 (34.3%) without hepatic decompensation. All patients had serum ceruloplasmin below 0.2 g/L [median = 0.12 g/L, range = <0.06-0.24], 27 (77.1%) had Kayser-Fleischer rings and 25 (83.3%) had urinary copper excretion greater than 1.6 pmol/day [median = 6.34 pmol/day, range = 1.71-65.07]. First-line treatments were penicillamine monotherapy (54.3%), penicillamine plus zinc (42.9%), and one patient (2.8%) received no treatment because she died shortly after admission. Thirteen (38.2%) of the penicillamine patients developed complications, namely hematuria (n=2), proteinuria (n=1), hematologic (n=1), IgA nephropathy (n=1), hyperprolactinaemia (n=1 ), myasthenia gravis (n=1), breast gigantism (n=1), mucositis (n=1), anemia (n=1), and rashes (n=4). In 13 patients, the medication was switched to trientine (n = 6), zinc (n = 3), trientine plus zinc (n = 2), and penicillamine plus zinc (n = 2). One patient received a liver transplant due to poor response to penicillamine therapy. The median follow-up time was 24 months (0.06-132). At the end of follow-up, 37.1% died and the mortality rate in fulminant WM was 77.8%. Conclusions: WM affects more women in our population, is diagnosed at a young age, and is primarily chronic WM with hepatic decompensation. All patients had low ceruloplasmin levels and a high proportion had Kayser-Fleischer rings. Penicillamine intolerance occurred in 38.2%. The mortality rate was 37.1%.",,"Shahar, H.;Tan, S.

Copper-poisoned rats showed swelling and an increase in the number of astrocytes, copper deposition in the choroid plexus, and neuronal degeneration. Trientine NPs of medium size (355 nm) and encapsulation efficiency (28 %) were synthesized. The nanoparticle-based therapy resulted in a significant reduction in Cu levels in the liver and brain. HPLC studies showed an increased concentration of trientine by NPs therapy compared to conventional trientine therapy in liver and brain tissue. In conclusion, the present study provides the first in vivo evidence that trientine-encapsulated NPs can significantly reverse impairments from chronic copper poisoning in Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Vasishta, R.

1543,Long-term follow-up of patients with Wilson's disease diagnosed in childhood: reasons for treatment changes,"Aims and study: Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder characterized by accumulation of copper primarily in the liver. The treatment is based on chelators and/or zinc. The effectiveness of zinc monotherapy was evaluated by Weiss et al. [1]. Aim: To evaluate the rationale for treatment changes in WM patients diagnosed in childhood. Methods: 44 patients with WM referred to our children's hospital (1984-2012) were analyzed. 42 had hepatic presentation and 2 were recruited for family screening. For each patient, the type of treatment performed was classified into: d-penicillamine; zinc salts; Combination of D-penicillamine and zinc. Reasons for treatment changes were: treatment failure, adverse events, patient demand (unrelated to adverse events), and maintenance therapy. From our analysis, we excluded treatment discontinuation related to the switch to maintenance therapy. We calculated the duration of each treatment block until a medication change or until the end of the follow-up period. We analyzed treatment change events using Kaplan-Meier estimation. Results: 44 (31 males, mean age at diagnosis = 5.9 years, range = 1-16.9) of the 48 patients evaluated were selected for treatment analysis. Changes in medical management were common events, leading to a total of 79 treatment blocks (32 penicillamine therapy, 35 zinc therapy, and 12 combination therapies). Of these, 76 (31 penicillamine therapy, 34 zinc therapy and 11 combination therapy) were eligible for analysis. In 4 of 34 zinc blocks (12%), 13 of 31 penicillamine blocks (42%) and 4 of 11 combination blocks (36%). Discontinuation due to adverse events was most common in patients receiving penicillamine, with 6 (5 penicillamine, 1 combination) of 42 block treatments discontinued for this reason. Medication change due to treatment failure was observed in 16 blocks of 76 (21%): 8 of 31 penicillamine treatments (26%), 4 of 34 zinc blocks (12%), and 4 of 11 combination blocks (36%). . This reached statistical significance when comparing zinc to combination therapy but not zinc to penicillamine. Among the treatment failure blocks, non-compliance was noted for 1 of 8 pencillamine treatments (12%), 2 of 4 zinc (12%), and 4 of 4 combination treatments (100%). Conclusion: Treatment discontinuation due to treatment failure and/or side effects was more frequent with penicillamine than with zinc. In contrast to Weiss data (1), our study confirmed that zinc monotherapy is effective in controlling liver disease in patients with WM who have been diagnosed and treated since childhood.",,"Ranucci, G.;Di Dato, F.;Tufano, M.;De Micco, I.;Nunziata, F.;Leone, F.;Iorio, R.",2013,2022-09-30 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2013.08.161,0,1,
1544,Levodopa-Responsive Parkinsonism and Autonomic (Small Fibre) Dysfunction in Patients with Wilson's Disease (WD),"Background: Autonomic dysfunction has rarely been described in WM patients. Aim: To describe a series of patients with WD, levodopa-responsive parkinsonism and autonomic dysfunction. Methods: After IRB approval, we evaluated 4 patients with WD and Parkinson's for the presence of neuromuscular dysfunction and performed a water-induced skin-fold test – SWT (Teoh, JNNP 2008;79:835). Results: Patient 1: A 37-year-old woman, who presented with cirrhosis at age 33, was diagnosed with WD and treated with ZnSO4, penicillamine, and piridoxine/complex B vitamins. Since the age of 35 she has developed Parkinsonism responsive to pramipexole and levodopa with burning and numbness in the arms and genitals and urinary incontinence. NCS/EMG was normal. Water-induced SWT showed small fiber dysfunction (mean 4-digit wrinkling of 1). Patient 2: A 23-year-old male was diagnosed with WD at age 14 and was treated with penicillamine + piridoxine. From the age of 21 he developed levodopa-responsive parkinsonism with resting tremor, weight loss, dysphagia and dysphonia. NCS/EMG was normal but water-induced SWT was abnormal (mean wrinkling of 0.25). Patient 3: A 34-year-old male with psychosis, behavioral disorders, levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, and episodes of loss of consciousness. He was treated with penicillamine and complex B vitamins. NCS/EMG and water-induced SWT were normal (mean wrinkling of 4). Patient 4: A 38-year-old female presented at age 24 with liver dysfunction, behavioral changes, and parkinsonism. She was diagnosed with WD and was treated with penicillamine and biperiden. Parkinsonism subsided almost completely with penicillamine. SWT was normal (mean wrinkling of 3.6). Conclusions: A subgroup of WM patients with levodopa-responsive parkinsonism also show abnormalities in SWT (autonomic dysfunction).",,"Gondim, F. D. A. A.;Oliveira, I. S.;Araujo, D. F.;Melo, A.

1545,D-penicillamine versus zinc sulfate as first-line treatment for Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson disease (WD) is a treatable inherited copper metabolism disorder. However, there is no international consensus on first-line therapy. Aim: Our aim was to compare the course of treatment in patients with symptomatic WM who started with D-penicillamine (DPA) or zinc sulfate (ZS) as the drug of choice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 143 consecutive, newly diagnosed patients with symptomatic WM between 2005 and 2009. The choice of first-line drug was at the physician's discretion. Data were analyzed in subgroups of predominantly neuropsychiatric and hepatic MV. Results: Neurological and enzymatic improvements were achieved with a similar frequency. In patients with neuropsychiatric WM, the likelihood of remaining on first-line therapy was similar for DPA and ZS (20% vs. 24% at the end of follow-up). In patients with hepatic WD, it was significantly higher for ZS (31% vs. 12%). After accounting for type of MB, gender, age at diagnosis, and presence of at least severe hepatic symptoms, patients treated with DPA were more likely to experience worsening during the first 6 months (OR 3.84, 95% CI: 1, 15-3.85). the treatment. Patients on DPA were significantly more compliant (94% vs 81%) but experienced more side effects (15% vs 3%). Conclusions: DPA and ZS are effective in the majority of WM patients. Despite certain differences, neither of them seems to be clearly superior. Therefore, ZS as a first-line therapy can be considered a reasonable alternative to DPA.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Litwin, T.;Karlinski, M.;Czerska, M.",2013,2022-10-15 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2013.07.467,0,1,
1546,Wilson's disease and psychiatric disorders: is there a comorbidity or indicator of relapse?,"Introduction: Wilson disease is a rare pathology resulting from an alteration of the ATP7B gene on the long arm of chromosome 13. This involves a reduction in copper transport in the bile and its accumulation in the body, particularly in the brain. Aim: The aim of this study is to illustrate the importance of psychiatric disorders in WM. Case report: A 25-year-old woman with a personal history of Wilson's disease (WD) presented with acute psychotic manifestations. The psychiatric interview finds a state of psychomotor excitement, aggressiveness and depressive mood with suicidal intentions. She also has bilateral extrapyramidal syndrome. Blood levels of copper and ceruloplasmin collapsed. The patient confirmed that she had stopped her treatment with D-penicillamine two months ago. Discussion: WM begins in at least 90% of patients as a hepatic, neurological, or psychiatric disease. In some rare cases, the first manifestations of the disease can be psychiatric, accounting for only 10%. The illness can later include isolated behavioral problems, a schizophrenic syndrome or a manic-depressive syndrome. The main difficulty was determining whether or not psychiatric disorders are included in the WD series. In fact, the neuropsychiatric comorbidity in the context of WD is significant. Poor adherence to therapy, copper balance, and improvement after reintroduction of D-penicillamine confirm psychiatric relapse of WM. Conclusion: In WM, psychiatric manifestations may precede, complicate, or be distinct from the somatic disorders. Early diagnosis is required for targeted treatment.",,"Mrabet, S.;Ellouze, F.;Mrad, M. F.",2013,2022-10-15 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2013.07.394,0,0,
1547,Increased seizure frequency due to copper deficiency in Wilson's disease,"Background: Epileptic seizures have been reported in 6-7% of patients in Wilson's disease (WD), mostly after chelation therapy. Pyridoxine deficiency from penicillamine, direct copper toxicity, pathologic changes, metabolic encephalopathy, and rarely copper deficiency are the attributed mechanisms for seizures. Aim: To present a patient with WD and intractable seizures who is taking chelating agents and antiepileptic therapy with a strictly copper-restricted diet. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 29-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with recurrent seizures. She had previously been diagnosed with WM and epilepsy at another center on treatment with penicillamine, zinc acetate and carbamazepine. Complex partial and, less commonly, secondarily generalized seizures have occurred after ingestion of penicillamine and initially responded well to carbamazepine. She complained of an increased daily frequency of seizures of 5 to 10 in recent months. Results: Although effective serum carbamazepine levels and levetiracetam adjunctive therapy, modified chelator therapy with trientine and oral pyridoxine did not reduce daily seizure frequency, and low serum copper levels [0.3 µg/dl (70-140)] were attributed to seizures . Zinc acetate and a strict copper-restricted diet were discontinued. As serum copper levels increased during follow-up [16 µg/dL (70-140)], seizure frequency decreased. Conclusion: Seizures respond well to antiepileptic treatment in WM. In this case, the additional antiepileptic and pyridoxine therapy did not reduce the seizure frequency. The relationship between reduced seizure frequency and increased serum copper levels indicates that copper deficiency can lead to intractable seizures in patients chelated with a strict copper-restricted diet.",,"Kaleagasi, H.;Oksuz, N.;Ozal, S.;Yilmaz, A.;Dogu, O.",2013,2022-10-15 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2013.07.209,0,0,
1548,A neuropsychiatric presentation of the case report of Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is an autosomal recessive disorder of human copper metabolism characterized by excessive accumulation of copper in the body, particularly in the brain, liver, kidney and cornea. A diagnosis of Wilson's disease is easily overlooked. About half of people with Wilson's disease (40%) have neurological or liver symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms due to Wilson's disease are present in 15% of patients. Objective: To present the case of an adolescent admitted to the Psychiatric Clinic of Tuzla University Hospital, initially presented with psychiatric and neurological symptoms, diagnosed as an etiological cause due to biochemical abnormalities of a copper metabolism, treated with etiological therapy and therapeutic effect . Case Report: An 18-year-old boy was admitted to the Department of Psychiatry at Tuzla University Hospital with a history of behavioral disturbances in the form of disinterest in his surroundings, decreased interactions with family, and signs of aphasia. Neurological examination revealed salivation, tongue protrusion, and general gear rigidity. Symptomatic treatment began without therapeutic efficacy. After conducting laboratory tests, findings showed low serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin, and with positive Kayser-Fleischer rings on ophthalmoscopic examination with slit lamp and computed tomography of the head, a neurodegenerative disease, Wilson's disease, was diagnosed. After the start of psychiatric observation and treatment, the patient was transferred to the Department of Neurology at Tuzla University Hospital. The patient responded very well to therapy with D-penicillamine, clozapine, essential phospholipids, vitamins and pyridoxine. Regular follow-up is recommended to evaluate the outcome.",,"Aljukic, N.;Sutovic, A.;Avdic, L.;Pajevic, I.;Hasanovic, M.",2013,,,0,0,
1549,Isosteric analogues of natural polyamines with altered carbon chain length and additional amino groups,"The cationic biogenic polyamines spermine (Spm) and spermidine (Spd) interact with negatively charged components of cells and are essential for cell growth and viability. Spm and Spd are positively charged at physiological pH (7.4) and the location of the charges defines their recognition. Changing the carbon chain length and adding additional amino group(s) to the polyamine backbone leads to isosteric analogues with reduced levels of protonation. The total net charge of 1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadodecane (SpmTriene), which is a Spm isostere, is +3 at physiological pH [1], while 1,8-diamino-3,6- diazaoctane (triene), which is Spd analog, is +2. Although these analogs have different localization and overall net charge, they still share some of the properties of their parent polyamines. Triene, an excellent chelator of Cu2+ ions, is used to treat Wilson's disease when the person is intolerant to penicillinamine, and recently triene has been shown to improve left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with type 2 diabetes [2]. Triene is a bad Spd mimetic: it penetrates cells poorly and cannot perform most Spd cell functions. However, triene exhibits some substrate properties of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT1) reaction [3], but its physiological acetylating enzyme is thialysine N-acetyltransferase [4]. SpmTriene is a more successful mimetic of Spm: it enters cells efficiently and can perform some of the cellular functions of Spm [3]. In cells and in vivo, SpmTriene is acetylated by SSAT1 and then oxidized to triene by acetylpolyamine oxidase [3,5]. Therefore, SpmTriene can be considered as a bioactive precursor of triene.",,"Weisell, J.;Hyvonen, M.;Khomutov, A.;Alhonen, L.;Vepsalainen, J.;Keinanen, T.",2013,July,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.12340,0,0,
1550,Different types of facial dystonia in a patient with Wilson's disease treated with botulinum toxin type A,"Aim: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin type A (BoTN-A) treatment in a patient with Wilson's disease (WD) and multiple types of facial dystonia and retrocollis. To describe the different types of abnormal movements exhibited by this patient. Background: WM is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism characterized by impaired excretion of this metal, leading to accumulation in many organs such as the liver, brain and cornea. Patients present clinically with psychiatric, neurological, or hepatic symptoms. BoNT treatment is the first-line approach for most focal dystonia, including those associated with WD. METHODS: A 20-year-old girl presented with a 9-month history of abnormal behavior, mild symmetrical parkinsonism, dysarthria, and a severe, short-term crisis of retrocollis and blepharospasm. Neurological examination revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings, a grinning facial expression, a sustained smile with an open mouth, a dystonic sagging jaw, and mild symmetrical parkinsonism. Irregular and frequent crises of severe blepharospasm and retrocollis were present. Brain MRI showed bilateral T2 and FLAIR basal ganglia hyperintensity involving the midbrain, thalami, putamen, and white matter. Serum ceruloplasmin and urine copper studies confirmed the diagnosis of WD. Treatment with zinc and D-penicillamine was established. Various types of facial dystonia and retrocollis have been treated with BoTN-A using an appropriate protocol. Results: BoTN-A improved facial and cervical dystonia by 80% with mild side effects (blurred vision). The improvement in quality of life was alleged. Careful visual analysis revealed various types of facial dystonia, including grinning facial expression with risus sardonicus, persistent smile with open mouth, dystonic sagging jaw, and irregular and frequent crises of severe blepharospasm and retrocollis. Conclusions: BoTN-A is a safe and effective treatment for the different types of facial dystonia and retrocolitis associated with WM. The combination of different types of facial dystonia and retrocollis should indicate WD.",,"Ramos Burbano, G.;Echeverry, A.;Ramirez, C.;Ramos Alarcon, G.;Ramos Arevalo, A.

1551,Initial Zinc Therapy in a Wilson's Disease Patient with Acute Liver Failure and Copper Poisoning: A Clinical Observation,"Aim: To evaluate whether (1) initial zinc therapy is effective in hepatic dysfunction in WM; (2) liver transplantation can be prevented by initial zinc therapy; (3) there is a correlation between normalized copper levels and clinical improvement. Background: Accumulation of copper in the brain and liver is thought to be responsible for neurodegeneration and liver disease in WM. Therefore, treatment was aimed at promoting urinary excretion of copper by chelators, while since 1961 clear evidence supports the idea of normalizing copper poisoning by zinc. METHODS: In an observational study of a 10-year-old girl with WM who presented with acute liver failure, hemolytic anemia, and high urinary copper, liver function and copper were retrospectively monitored before and after initial zinc therapy. The patient was placed on 125 mg/d elemental zinc. A liver transplant was also considered. Liver enzymes, bilirubin, and urinary copper were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of zinc therapy. Results: The patient improved biochemically and clinically within 10 days of zinc therapy, corresponding to an 86% decrease in urinary copper. The revised WD prognostic index improved from 13 to 5 and the patient was removed from the transplant list. After 2, 4, 8 weeks of zinc therapy, AST, ALT, bilirubin, and urinary copper showed constant improvements of up to 62, 226, 82, and 77%, respectively, through week eight. The results for the second 8 week period showed a further decrease of 25, 41, 48, 86 and 33% for serum free copper compared to the previous results. No side effects or clinical deterioration were observed during the 16-week treatment period. Conclusions: The results suggest that zinc is a promising, fast-acting, safe, and affordable choice for the treatment of copper poisoning in WM with acute liver failure. It also supports the hypothesis of normalizing high serum-free copper, which can save life and costly and risky liver transplantation, rather than stimulating the excretion of accumulated copper.",,"Avan, A.;Kianifar, H.

1552,Effective transition from traditional chelation therapy to evidence-based zinc monotherapy in four patients with Wilson's disease and Parkinson's disease,"Aim: To compare clinical improvement in patients with Wilson's disease (1) after normalization of high serum and urinary free copper levels instead of elimination of copper accumulation and (2) on zinc therapy with and without penicillamine. Background: For years, the treatment of Wilson's disease has aimed to stimulate the excretion of enriched copper by chelating agents. However, the dilemma arises when, paradoxically, patients deteriorate on it. Zinc, on the other hand, is usually downplayed by being limited to maintenance or adjunctive therapy. Chelating agents increase free copper levels in serum and urine, while zinc normalizes levels by disrupting copper absorption in the gut. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study of four Parkinson's disease patients initially treated with penicillamine with or without zinc, we compared subjective and objective clinical improvement before and after switching to zinc monotherapy. Results: Three of the four patients whose condition deteriorated on penicillamine (0.5-1 gram per day) improved significantly to a normal biochemical and clinical condition on zinc (150 milligrams per day). The fourth patient, who received penicillamine (250 milligrams per day) plus zinc (200 milligrams per day), improved in the lower extremities in the first month, while improving significantly in the following months on zinc monotherapy. Conclusions: The results of the four patients suggest that zinc is a promising, safe, and affordable treatment for patients with copper poisoning and neurological Wilson's disease. Furthermore, they support the rationale of normalizing elevated serum and urine copper levels rather than stimulating the excretion of accumulated copper that triggers free copper poisoning.",,"Avan, A.;Azarpazhooh, M.

1553,Current status of Wilson's disease: does early treatment protect against nervous system impairment?,"Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate the nervous system effects of Wilson disease (WD) in early treated (ET) patients with long disease duration. Background: During the course of WM, neurological disorders (ND) have frequently been described, especially with delayed treatment. In recent years, most childhood WM cases have been diagnosed at the onset of hypertransaminasemia (HT), which was treated early and subsequently showed no apparent progression of the disease. METHODS: A clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroradiological evaluation was performed in patients with WM with long duration of disease and therapy. Clinical-neurological assessment was performed using the neurological section of the Global Assessment Scale (GAS) for WD. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was performed to study central conduction time and cortical excitability using the paired pulse technique, in which short-interval cortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation were examined. A brain MRI scan was performed on each patient. RESULTS: 27 patients (16 M, age range 13-47 years) with a mean disease duration of 16.5 years (range 7-28) were studied in 2011-2012. All patients started treatment shortly after diagnosis and are currently taking pennicillamine (6 patients) or zinc acetate (21 patients). TMS and brain MRI studies were normal in 23 subjects who were diagnosed with WD because of childhood HT and never reported ND. The remaining 4 patients were diagnosed in adolescence and presented with ND at onset, only 2 of them still show neurological signs (GAS 16-18), but all have brain MRI changes while TMS findings are normal. Conclusions: In recent decades, the natural history of WD appears to have changed, as the nervous system could not be affected when patients were diagnosed in childhood and received early treatment (Ala A 2007). Our study confirms that ET patients who do not present with ND at baseline do not show any neurological clinical symptoms even after a long duration of the disease. The normality of the TMS and brain MRI studies also suggest the absence of subclinical impairment of the nervous system.",,"Esposito, M.;Dubbioso, R.;Manganelli, F.;Ranucci, G.;Didato, F.;Matarazzo, M.;Iorio, R.;Santoro, L.",2013,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25605,0,1,
1554,Levodopa-responsive parkinsonism and small fiber dysfunction in patients with Wilson's disease,"Aim: To describe a series of patients with Wilson's disease (WD) associated with levodopa-responsive parkinsonism and autonomic dysfunction. Background: Patients with WM present or develop a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms during the course of the disease. Few reports have described autonomic dysfunction in WM patients. METHODS: Chart review of 4 patients with WD who were evaluated for the presence of neuromuscular dysfunction and had a water-induced skinfold test (Teoh, JNNP 2008;79:835). This study was approved by the local institutional IRB. Results: Patient 1: A 37-year-old patient, who presented at age 33 with cirrhosis, was diagnosed with WD and treated with ZnSO4, penicillamine, and piridoxine/complex B vitamins. From the age of 35, she developed Parkinsonism responsive to pramipexole and levodopa, burning and numbness in the arms and genitals, and urinary incontinence. NCS/EMG was normal, but water-induced skin-fold test (SWT) showed small fiber dysfunction (mean 4-digit wrinkling of 1). Patient 2: A 23-year-old man was diagnosed with WM at the age of 14 and has since been treated with penicillamine and piridoxine. From the age of 21 he developed levodopa-responsive parkinsonism with resting tremor, weight loss, dysphagia and dysphonia. NCS/EMG was normal but water-induced SWT was abnormal (mean 4-digit wrinkling of 0.25). Patient 3: A 34-year-old patient with psychosis and major conduct disorder followed by levodopa-responsive parkinsonism and episodes of unconsciousness. He has a family history of WD and has been treated with penicillamine and complex B vitamins. NCS/EMG and water-induced SWT were normal (mean 4-digit wrinkling of 4). Patient 4: A 38-year-old man who presented at age 24 with hepatic dysfunction, behavioral changes, and parkinsonism (upper extremity tremor at rest and akinetic-rigid state) and was diagnosed with WD. She was treated with penicillamine and biperiden. Parkinsonism resolved almost completely after treatment with penicillamine. Water-induced SWT was normal (mean 4-digit wrinkling of 3.6). Conclusions: A subset of WM patients with levodopa-responsive parkinsonism also show abnormalities on the skin fold test (autonomic dysfunction).",,"Gondim, F. A.;Araujo, D. F.;Oliveira, I.

1555,Changes in cortical excitability and central motor conduction time in patients with Wilson's disease,"Aim: To determine cortical excitability changes in patients with WD by measuring resting cortical motor threshold (RMT) and central motor conduction time (CMCT) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Background: Wilson's disease (WD), an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, leads to extensive structural changes in the central nervous system. However, little is known about the neuronal dysfunction in this condition. METHODS: The subjects of this study were 13 patients (10 male and 3 female) with WD diagnosed by the presence of Kayser-Fleischer and biochemical parameters. TMS was performed using a figure-8 coil attached to a Magstim 200 stimulator. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) at rest. The RMT was determined using standard techniques and the CMCT by the ""F"" wave method. A comparison was made with data from 26 healthy controls. Results: The mean age of the patients was 19.5 +/- 9.5 years, the mean age at symptom onset was 16.5 +/- 10.7 years and the mean disease duration was 2.8 +/- 2.5 years. Of the 13 patients, 11 patients were treated with zinc sulfate and/or penicillamine and two patients were not taking any medication. Dysarthria was the main symptom in five patients (38.5%). Chorea, tremor, dystonia and abnormal gait were the symptoms in two patients each (15.4%). RMT was detectable in 10 patients and undetectable in 3 patients. Compared to controls, patients with WD in whom RMT was detectable had significantly higher mean RMT and CMCT (RMT: 80.9 +/- 14.8 vs. 41.1 +/- 7, p<0.0001 ; CMCT: 6.7 +/- 0.5 ms vs. 4.8 +/- 0.6 ms, p < 0.0001). The disease duration of the three patients in whom no RMT was detectable was 4, 2 and 1 year. In two of these three patients, an MEP could be achieved with active contraction of the right FDI. The CMCT was also prolonged in these two patients (8.8 ms and 5.6 ms). Conclusions: Patients with WD have reduced cortical excitability and prolonged central motor conduction time, which may be due to intracortical presynaptic motor dysfunction. Follow-up studies are needed to determine if these changes are reversible with a decopper treatment.",,"Jhunjhunwala, K. R.;Prashant, D. K.;Pal, P.

1556,A case of Wilson's disease with lid opening apraxia treated with botulinum toxin,"Aim: To describe the response to botulinum toxin injection in a case of severe neuropsychiatric Wilson's disease with lid-opening apraxia. Background: Ocular findings such as Kayser-Fleischer rings and sunflower cataracts are known to be associated with Wilson's disease. Other ocular findings have been reported and are sometimes considered incidental. To our knowledge, lid opening apraxia was described only once by JR Keane in 1988. There is no case report of lid opening apraxia treated by botulinum injection in Wilson's disease. METHODS: The patient experienced worsening of his neurological condition after the initiation of D-penicillamine with the development of lid opening apraxia. He used sensory tricks to open his eyes. He was almost functionally blind and needed assistance walking because of his closed eyes. No weakness or ptosis was detectable on examination. We injected onabotulinumtoxinA into the upper and lower eyelids bilaterally into the pretarsal portion of the orbicularis oculi muscles. The ocular findings also showed Kayser-Fleischer rings, sunflower cataracts, eye flutter and square wave twitching. Results: Two days after the injection, the patient noticed a dramatic improvement in his condition with a significant improvement in his quality of life. No side effects have been reported. Conclusions: This is the second case of lid opening apraxia in Wilson's disease and the first reported reaction to botulinum toxin injection. Our results also support the idea that lid opening apraxia is a pretarsal dystonia with the presence of sensory tricks, association with lower facial dystonia (risus sardonicus) and response to botulinum toxin injection.",,"Dufresne, A.

1557,The accumulation of metals in the brain in Wilson's disease,"AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the concentration of copper, iron, zinc and manganese in MV brain autopsy tissues and their association with the phenotypic presentation of MV. BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited copper metabolism disorder characterized by pathologic accumulation of copper in tissues, primarily in the liver and brain. Previous studies have shown that accumulation of other metals in brain tissue occurs in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. So far, however, this problem has not been quantitatively studied in WD. DESIGN/METHODS: Study material consisted of 17 brains (12 WM patients, 5 controls) obtained at autopsy. Samples were taken from 4 different regions of each brain: frontal cortex, putamen, dentate nucleus and pons. Copper, manganese and zinc grades were determined using plasma mass spectrometry. The iron concentration was measured with atomic absorption spectroscopy. The clinical presentation of WD has been considered to be hepatic or neuropsychiatric. RESULTS: The copper content was homogeneously increased in all examined structures of MV brains compared to controls (41.0 +/- 18.6 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.8 mg/g, p < 0.01) . The concentrations of manganese and zinc in WD brains were similar to controls and did not differ between the analyzed brain parts. However, iron concentration in the dentate nucleus was significantly higher in WD brains (56.8 +/- 14.1 vs. 32.6 +/- 6.0 µg/g, p<0.05). There were no associations between the concentration of any metal in any part of the brain and the clinical presentation of WD. Conclusions: According to our findings, copper accumulates in different parts of the brain over the course of WD, regardless of the predominant phenotypic presentation. Zinc and manganese do not appear to be involved in the pathology. However, increased amounts of iron appear to accumulate in the dentate nucleus. We suspect that this effect is due to reduced levels of ceruloplasmin, but further studies are needed.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Litwin, T.;Gromadzka, G.;Szpak, G.;Bulska, E.",2013,,,0,0,
1558,Therapeutic efficacy of D-penicillamine-encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles in the rat model of copper toxicity with neurobehavioural disorders,"Animal models of Wilson's disease (WD), viz. Long Evans cinnamon rats rarely show neurological symptoms, which hampers the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat neurological manifestations in WM patients. The aim of this study was to 1. examine the effect of intraperitoneally injected copper lactate over 90 days, particularly on the levels of copper and zinc in liver, kidney and brain tissue; Expression of hepatic metallothionein-I (MT-I) and Atp7b gene; and MT-III and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene in brain, biochemical parameters and neurobehavioural functions of male Wistar rats and 2nd therapeutic evaluation of orally administered D-penicillamine-encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles for 90 days on Cu-poisoned Wistar -Rats. Reverse transcription PCR and Morris water maze test were used for expression and neurobehavioral studies. Copper-poisoned animals showed significantly increased levels of ceruloplasmin, serum and urine copper and decreased serum acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, increased expression of the hepatic MT-I gene with impaired neuromuscular coordination and spatial memory. However, no changes in the expression levels of the hepatic Ap7b gene were observed; and MT-III and AChE gene in brain. Cu-poisoned rats showed a significant increase in copper content in liver, brain and kidney tissue (increase of 99.1, 73 and 74.9%, respectively), decreased zinc content in the liver (decrease of 40%) and, interestingly, increased zinc content in the brain (77.1% increase) compared to control rats. Histopathological studies revealed grade 4 copper deposits in liver and grade 1 copper-associated proteins in liver tissues of test rats by rhodanine and orcein stains, respectively. Astrocytic swelling was observed in cerebral cortical sections of brain tissues from Cu-poisoned rats. Therapy with D-penicillamine-encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles resulted in a significant reduction in liver and brain Cu levels, serum ceruloplasmin levels and an increase in serum AChE activity with an improvement in neurological functions. In summary, chronic copper toxicity can lead to increased liver and brain copper levels, increased hepatic MT-I gene expression, ceruloplasmin levels, and neurobehavioural disorders by disrupting acetylcholine-modulated neurotransmission; However, D-penicillamine-encapsulated nanoparticles can significantly reverse impairments caused by chronic Cu intoxication in Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Badyal, R.;Vasishta, R.

1559,Wilson's disease in children: the rate of liver cirrhosis,"Introduction: The initial manifestation of WM is variable and is rarely seen in children less than 5 years of age, in most cases presenting with abnormal liver function. Aim: To determine the liver cirrhosis rate in children with WD. Materials and Methods: 101 children (boys - 50; girls - 51; mean age 12.3 +/- 2.9 years). The diagnosis of WD was supported by decreased serum ceruloplasmin (SC), increased urinary copper excretion: basal (Cu0) and after D-penicillamine provocation (Cu1), the presence of Kaiser-Fleischer rings (KF), increased copper content in of the liver and genetic analysis. Cirrhosis is diagnosed based on morphological data or complex laboratory and instrumental studies. Results: At the initial diagnosis of WD, liver cirrhosis was detected in 44 (43.6%) children aged 13.3 +/- 2.1 years: in children under 12 years - in 14 (31.1%), over 12 years - even in 30 (53.6%) patients (p < 0.05). In children with liver cirrhosis, the presence of extrapyramidal neurological symptoms was significantly (p < 0.05) more often noted - 36.4% of cases, the presence of KF - in 68.2% of children, acute Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia (HA) - in 20.5% children compared with patients with WD without cirrhotic liver transformation (n = 57), in which the rate of neurological symptoms - 10.5%, the presence of KF - 24.6%, the presence of HA - 3.5% children amounted. In children with WD in the stage of liver cirrhosis: Cu0 189.5 [111.1; 492.9] µg/24h, Cu1 2015.5+/-1206.7 µg/24h, which is significantly higher than in children with WD without liver cirrhosis: Cu0 100.8 [74.7, 133.0] µg/24h , Cu1 1529.0+/-866.9 µg/ 24 h (p < 0.05). SC does not depend on the stage of WD: with liver cirrhosis, SC was 9.1 +/- 5.2 mg/dl, and without it - 11.3 +/- 7.6 mg/dl (p > 0.05). Conclusion: In pediatric practice there is a late diagnosis of MM, which in 43.6% leads to the diagnosis of the disease in the cirrhotic stage. Liver cirrhosis in children with WD is associated with the presence of KF (68.2%), neurological symptoms (36.4%), and higher excretion of urinary copper.",,"Chetkina, T.;Potapov, A.;Varichkina, M.;Pakhomovskaya, N.;Senyakovitch, V.;Tumanova, E.;Karagulian, N.",2013,April,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0168-8278%2813%2961384-7,0,0,
1560,Acute hemolytic anemia as the initial presentation of Wilson's disease in children,"Background: Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Hemolytic anemia (HA) in WM occurs in up to 17% of patients at some point during their illness. Goals: Goal: Our goal was to screen children with HA for WD. Design/Method: Methodology: 20 cases (mean age 8.8 +/- 3.9 years) with Coombs-negative HA attending the Hematology Clinic of Cairo University Children's Hospital were characterized by serum ceruloplasmin levels, 24-hour copper examined for WD in urine before and after D-Pencillamine provocation test (PCT) and slit lamp examination for detection of Kayser-Fleisher. Results: Results: No case had low ceruloplasmin levels, while bilateral Kayser-Fleisher rings were detected in 5% of our cases. Urinary copper was elevated in 5% before and 40% after PCT. According to the scoring system used, 1 case had definite MIC and 7 cases had probable MIC. These 8 (40%) cases were designated as Group B and compared to the rest of the patients (Group A). Group B had significantly lower hemoglobin, MCV and MCH and Retika (p=0.04, 0.001, 0.04 and 0.04, respectively) and significantly higher urinary copper after penicillamine compared to group A (unlikely Wilson) ( p=0.000).

1561,Medicines for orphans and rare diseases in Andorra,"Background and Aim: To determine the prevalence of rare diseases (RD) in treatment with orphan drugs (OD) and their economic impact on the drug budget (PB). Setting and method: Retrospective observational study over a period of 1 year (05/01/2011 to 05/01/2012) of patients with diagnosed RD in treatment with OD in Andorra. The estimated population is about 80,000 people and this country has only one hospital. Data were obtained from 1. Datasets of inpatient/outpatient pharmacy software (Farmatools) to identify the OD dispensed by the hospital pharmacy department and obtain variables related to the use of drugs in units and costs in euros. 2. Sales report of OD imported from international wholesaler during the study period. OD requests from community pharmacies were included. 3. Orphanet web page to establish variables: relationship of OD/RD indication and estimated prevalence of RD in Europe (reviewed May 2012). We include OD which has received European Marketing Authorization. Triemtine was also included because of its orphan status. Main outcome measures: type of OD, type of RD, number of patients diagnosed and treated, OD cost (euro), annual pharmacy-hospital drug budget (euro). Results: 18 patients were identified in treatment with OD for RD, 50% male, 67% adult (range 14-64 years), and 33% elderly (>65 years). The overall prevalence was 18/80,000 (equivalent to 22.5/100,000), with 8 different RD and a patient/RD ratio of 2.25 (range 1-5). Specific prevalences were: pulmonary arterial hypertension: 5/80,000, systemic sclerosis and multiple myeloma: 3/80,000, Wilson's disease and chronic myeloid leukemia: 2/80,000, medullary thyroid carcinoma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and myelodisplastic syndrome: 1/80,000. The OD indication was not met in two cases: aerosolized tobramycin for the treatment of bronchiectasis with chronic lung infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa without cystic fibrosis (2 patients) and sorafenib for the treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma (1 patient). OD distribution (number of patients): bosentan (6), aerosolized tobramycin (2), imatinib mesilate (2), lenalidomide (2), sildenafil citrate (2), trientine (1), zinc acetate dihydrate (1), azacitidine (1st ), pirfenidone (1), sorafenib, thalidomide (1), intravenous ibuprofen (0). The economic impact of OD in the pharmaceutical hospital budget was 8.2% over the study period. Of these 8.2, 16.5% relate to off-label OD use. Economic OD distribution based on ATC category was: A: 2.1%, C: 29.7%, G: 0.7%, J: 4.1%, L: 63.4%. Conclusions: - The prevalence of OD treated RD in Andorra was 18/80,000 - The economic impact of RD on the hospital pharmacy budget during the study period was 8.2% - Pulmonary arterial hypertension is the most prevalent RD in Andorra.",,"Gea, E.;Gil, E.;Barral, N.;Gonzalez, V.;Soler, A.;Avellanet, M.",2013,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11096-013-9801-0,0,0,
1562,Hepatocellular carcinoma in Wilson's disease,"Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma and other tumors of the liver are extremely rare in Wilson's disease. We report the case of a 41-year-old patient who presented with hepatocellular carcinoma associated with Wilson's disease. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of 16. He was hospitalized at the age of 41 with abdominal pain and radiographic evidence of a mass in the right lobe of the liver with multiple pulmonary nodules. The patient died 7 days after admission. We conclude that patients with Wilson's disease should be considered at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. Aliver imaging and alpha-fetoprotein levels should be included in the follow-up of patients with Wilson disease. Methods: In this paper, we describe the case of a young patient with Wilson's disease associated with HCC who was diagnosed with HCC after 25 years of treatment with penicillamine and zinc. Results: Wilson disease is a hepatolinticular degeneration resulting from a mutation in the ATP7B gene, which is responsible for the production of proteins important for copper transport and the elimination of excess free copper from the body. D-penicillamine contains a free sulfhydryl group that acts as a copper chelating agent. Its main action is to promote urinary excretion of copper and reduce the affinity of proteins for copper. Oral zinc interferes with copper absorption, it induces metallothionein (an endogenous metal chelator) in enterocytes, which has a greater affinity for copper than for zinc, thereby binding luminal copper and thereby preventing its entry into the circulation [7, 8]. It is assumed that hepatic copper has a protective effect against malignant transformation [9, 10]. Some studies have found that copper can prevent the occurrence of HCC [11, 12]. However, patients with longstanding Wilson's disease who are treated with D-penicillamine have a higher risk of developing HCC. On the other hand, patients with Wilson's disease require lifelong therapy. Discontinuation of therapy can lead to the development of acute failure. In this case report, a long duration of disease under pinicillamine therapy played a role in the presence of HCC. Whether copper increases or decreases HCC risk remains to be determined [13]. A number of important risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been identified and their role in the development of HCC is known. These include hepatitis B carrier status, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, hereditary hemochromatosis, and cirrhosis of almost any cause [14]. While the development of HCC in patients with Wilson's disease is extremely rare. In summary, regular follow-up of patients with Wilson's disease with regular checking of alfafetopritia levels and abdominal ultrasound is recommended to detect HCC earlier and they may benefit from other treatment modalities of HCC, e.g. B. surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, or other modality that might be indicated. Potential enrollment in a transplant program can, in some cases, be beneficial to patients. Conclusion: In conclusion, regular follow-up of patients with Wilson's disease with regular checking of alpha-fetopritia levels and abdominal US is recommended in order to detect HCC earlier and to benefit from other treatment modalities of HCC, e.g. B. surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization or other modalities that may be indicated.

Mutations in the SLC30A10 gene, which encodes a manganese transporter, cause a cirrhosis-dystonia-polycythemia-hypermanganemia syndrome. METHODS: We present 10-year longitudinal clinical characteristics, MRI data and treatment response to chelation therapy in the originally described patient with a confirmed homozygous mutation in SLC30A10. Results: The patient presented with early onset generalized dystonia and mild hyperbilirubinaemia, accompanied by elevated whole blood manganese levels. MRI T1 sequences showed hyperintensities in the basal ganglia and cerebellum characteristic of manganese deposits. Treatment with intravenous disodium edetate resulted in clinical improvement and reduction in brain imaging hyperintensities.

1567,The molecular basis of memory,"We propose a three-pronged biochemical mechanism for memory. Three physiological components are involved, namely the neuron (individual and circuit), the surrounding neural extracellular matrix, and the various trace metals distributed within the matrix. Binding of a metal cation affects a corresponding nanostructure (shrinkage, twist, expansion) and dielectric sensitivity of the chelating node (address) within the matrix lattice, which is sensed by the neuron. The neural extracellular matrix serves as an electroelastic lattice in which neurons manipulate multiple trace metals (n > 10) to encode, store, and decode cognitive information. The proposed mechanism explains the brain's low energy requirements and high storage capacity, described in multiples of the Avogadro number (N<inf>A</inf> = 6 x 10<sup>23</sup>). Supporting evidence correlates memory loss with toxicity or deficiency of trace metals or breakdown in the delivery/transportation of metals to the matrix or their degradation. Inherited disorders centered around impaired trace metal metabolism and memory disorders include Alzheimer's disease (Al, Zn, Fe), Wilson's disease (Cu), thalassemia (Fe), and autism (metallothionein). The three-part mechanism points to the electroelastic interactions of neurons with trace metals distributed in the neural extracellular matrix as the molecular basis of ""synaptic plasticity"" affecting short-term memory, long-term memory, and forgetting. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Marx, G.;Gilon, C.",2012,2022-08-15 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/cn300097b,0,0,

In this article, we show that P57/Gd, a novel prion-based contrast agent, can selectively image tissues with excessive copper accumulation using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). P57/Gd selectivity binds copper(II) over other physiologically relevant cations such as zinc, iron, manganese and calcium. To simulate metabolic copper dysfunction, we treated mice with an intraperitoneal injection of a CuSO<inf>4</inf> solution to induce renal copper overload.

1570,Therapy suggestions for occult chronic hypertransaminasemia,"Less than 25% of asymptomatic adults have elevated transaminase levels on initial testing, and one-third of these patients have normal levels on repeat testing. Of those who have elevated ALT at repeat testing, some have acute liver disease (with normal ALT for less than 6 months) and the others represent the category of chronic (greater than 6 months) transaminase elevations. The etiology of chronic hypertransaminases can be elucidated in 90% of cases due to liver disease with occult/atypical development or extrahepatic causes of chronic transaminase elevation. The remaining 10% represent the category of unexplained (obscure cause) transaminase elevations. The occult/atypical evolutionary liver diseases are represented by chronic viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV), alcohol consumption, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), congested liver, drugs and liver toxic substances, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, a1-antitrypsin deficiency, parasitic diseases. The extrahepatic causes that can determine chronic transaminase elevations are hemolysis, soft muscle disease (polymyositis), occult celiac disease, adrenal insufficiency, thyroid pathology. There still remains 10% of patients in whom the etiology cannot be explained. Usually, these patients are monitored, periodically reassessed, and have a second liver biopsy; Witch can show nonspecific lesions, NASH, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis. There are cases when spontaneous normalization of transaminases was observed during the monitoring period. Chronic hypertransaminasemia is quite common and can very well be referred to the doctor by patients with this type of pathology, since for most of them it is an accidental discovery during a routine blood test. It is also important to have a clear diagnosis in order to be able to start the specific treatment as soon as possible for those patients who can benefit. © 2012.",,"Adriana, N.;Cristina, O.;Olariu, M.;Olteanu, D.",2012,,,0,0,

1572,Can mothers with Wilson's disease give their child breast milk? [Japanese],"Background: Wilson disease is a genetic disorder characterized by accumulation of copper in various tissues. To remove accumulated copper in the body, patients are treated with trientine, penicillamine, or zinc. These treatments should be continued for life. Breastfeeding has recently been recommended for babies worldwide. When patients with Wilson's disease have a baby, they want to breastfeed their infants even as they continue treatment for Wilson's disease. However, no studies have been conducted on the safety of feeding breast milk to mothers being treated for Wilson's disease. This study addresses the safety of breastfeeding in mothers treated for Wilson's disease. Materials and Methods: Breast milk was obtained from 4, 4 and 2 patients with Wilson's disease treated with trientine, penicillamine and zinc, respectively. As control breast milk, colostrum, transitional milk and mature milk were obtained from 16, 6 and 11 healthy mothers, respectively. The copper and zinc concentrations in breast milk were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrometry. At the same time, the distribution profiles of copper in breast milk were analyzed using HPLC-ICP-MS. Trientine or penicillamine bound copper levels in patients were also analyzed by HPLC-ICP-MS. Results and Discussion: Copper and zinc concentrations were almost normal in the breast milk of mothers with Wilson's disease treated with the drugs described above. A slightly higher concentration of zinc and copper was found in some of the patients' breast milks, but these levels were within concentrations found in infant formula. HPLC-ICP-MS analysis of breast milk from these mothers detected the highest peak in lactoalbumin-bound copper. No peak of trientine and penicillamine was detected in the milk. Conclusions: These results suggest that mothers with Wilson's disease can breastfeed their babies even if they continue treatment for Wilson's disease.",,"Izumi, Y.",2012,January,,0,0,

The recommendations are based on a systematic literature search in the databases Medline (PubMed version), Embase (Dialog version) and the databases of the Cochrane Library using entries from 1966 to 2011. The used Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system in other EASL guidelines was used and compared to the slightly different grading system used in the AASLD guidelines (Table 1A and B). Unfortunately, there is not a single randomized controlled trial that has been conducted in Wilson's disease that has an optimal design.

1576,zinc and liver diseases,"Zinc is an essential trace mineral needed for normal cell growth, development and differentiation. It is involved in DNA synthesis, RNA transcription, and cell division and activation. It is a critical component in many zinc proteins/enzymes including critical zinc transcription factors. Zinc deficiency/altered metabolism is seen in many types of liver disease including alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and viral liver disease. Some of the mechanisms for zinc deficiency/altered metabolism include decreased food intake, increased urinary excretion, activation of certain zinc transporters, and induction of hepatic metallothionein. Zinc deficiency can manifest itself in many ways in liver disease, including skin lesions, poor wound healing/liver regeneration, altered mental status, or altered immune function. Zinc supplementation has been documented to block/attenuate experimental ALD through multiple processes including stabilization of gut barrier function, reduction in endotoxemia, reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine production, reduction in oxidative stress, and reduction in apoptotic hepatocyte death. Clinical trials of liver disease in humans are limited in scope and quality, but it is clear that zinc supplementation reverses the clinical signs of zinc deficiency in patients with liver disease. Some studies suggest improvement in liver function in both ALD and hepatitis C after zinc supplementation, and 1 study suggested improved fibrosis markers in hepatitis C patients.

1578,Selective divalent copper chelation for the treatment of diabetes mellitus,"Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been identified by many investigators as key pathogenic mechanisms in age-related metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases (eg, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and Alzheimer's disease). Although numerous molecular mechanisms have been developed to explain these processes, their exact nature remains unclear. This author has previously suggested that these two mechanisms in such diseases are likely to occur as manifestations of a single underlying disorder in copper regulation. Copper is an essential but highly toxic trace metal that is tightly regulated in biological systems. Several rare genetic disorders of copper homeostasis are known in humans: These primarily affect various proteins that mediate intracellular copper transport processes and can lead to either copper deficiency or tissue overload. These examples illustrate how disrupted regulation of copper transport pathways can cause organ damage and provide important insights into the impact of defects in specific molecular processes, including those mediated by the copper-transporting ATPases ATP7A (mutated in Menkes disease), ATP7B (Wilson's disease) ) and the copper chaperones such as those for cytochrome c oxidase, SCO1 and SCO<inf>2</inf>. In diabetes, impaired copper regulation is manifested by increased urinary Cu<sup>II</sup> excretion, systemic chelatable Cu<sup>II</sup> and complete copper balance, increased prooxidative stress and defective antioxidant defenses, and with progressive damage to the blood vessels, heart, kidneys, retina and nerves. Links between dysregulated copper and organ damage can be demonstrated by Cu<sup>II</sup>-selective chelation, which simultaneously prevents/reverses both copper dysregulation and organ damage. Pathogenic structures in blood vessels that contribute to the binding and localization of catalytically active Cu<sup>II</sup> are likely to include advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and atherosclerotic plaque: the latter is likely to undergo AGE modification itself. Defective copper regulation mediates organ damage through two general processes occurring simultaneously in the same individual: elevation of Cu<sup>II</sup>-mediated prooxidative stress and impairment of copper-catalyzed antioxidant defense mechanisms. This author has proposed that diabetes-induced copper dysregulation is an important new target for therapeutic interventions to prevent/reverse organ damage in diabetes, heart failure, and neurodegenerative diseases, and that triethylenetetramine (TETA) is the first in a new class of anti - diabetic molecules that target these copper-mediated pathogenic mechanisms. TETA prevents tissue damage and induces organ regeneration by acting as a highly selective Cu <sup>II</sup> chelating agent that suppresses copper-mediated oxidative stress and restores antioxidant defenses. My group has used TETA in an extensive program of nonclinical and clinical proof-of-principle studies, characterizing copper dysregulation in diabetes and identifying numerous interconnected cellular and molecular mechanisms by which TETA exerts its therapeutic effects. Many of the results obtained in non-clinical models regarding the molecular mechanisms of diabetic organ damage have not yet been replicated in patient tissues, so their applicability to human disease must be considered inferential until the results of more meaningful clinical studies Are available. Based on the findings from the studies discussed here, trientine is now in the later stages of pharmaceutical development for the treatment of heart failure and other diabetic complications. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",,"Cooper, G.

1579,Chelating agent for neurodegenerative diseases,"It has emerged in recent years that metal ion homeostasis and its dysfunction, which leads to increased accumulation in the brain, particularly of copper, iron and zinc, can be associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases, such that chelation therapy can be a therapeutic option. We briefly outline the currently available chelators along with strategies for developing new chelators capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. Brain iron homeostasis along with changes in brain iron levels with age will be examined, as well as the role of iron in Parkinson's disease and the potential of chelation therapy in Parkinson's disease. Copper and zinc homeostasis in the brain and age-related changes are then outlined, along with a discussion of the possible involvement of Zn, Cu and Fe in Alzheimer's disease. We conclude with a brief summary of chelation therapy in AD. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",,"Ward, R. J.;Dexter, D. T.;Crichton, R. R.",2012,June,,0,0,
1580,Penicillamine increases free copper and increases oxidative stress in the brains of toxic milk mice,"Wilson disease (WD) is characterized by an accumulation of copper resulting from a mutation in the ATP7B gene. Penicillamine (PA) neurologically aggravates 10-50% of patients with neurological symptoms early in the course of administration. The aim of this study was to find out how copper metabolism changes and whether the change affects the brain of toxic milk (tx) mice, an animal model of WD, during PA administration. The concentrations of free copper and protein-bound copper in the serum, cortex and basal ganglia of tx mice with PA administration over 3 days, 10 days and 14 days were investigated. The expression of the copper transporters ATP7A and CTR1 was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence and western blot. Subsequently, SOD, MDA and GSH/GSSG were detected to determine if the oxidative stress changed accordingly. The results showed the increased levels of free serum and brain copper and decreased levels of protein-bound brain copper of tx mice during PA administration. Meanwhile, transiently increased expression of ATP7A and CTR1 in general in brain parenchyma was observed by immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. Additionally, it has been observed that ATP7A and CTR1 are mainly located at the Golgi apparatus and the cell membrane, respectively. On days 3 and 10 of PA treatment, intense staining of ATP7A in the choroid plexus was found in tx mice, but infrequent staining of ATP7A and CTR1 in the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Decreased GSH/GSSG and increased MDA concentrations were also observed in the cortex and basal ganglia. Our results suggested that the increased levels of free copper in the brain could lead to increased oxidative stress during PA administration. According to the ATP7A and CTR1 expression analysis, the increased free copper in the brain could originate from the copper mobilized from brain parenchyma cells, but not from the serum. © 2012 Chen et al.",,"Chen, D.

1581,Current and future techniques in the assessment of dysphagia,"Dysphagia is common in the general population and is generally due to either mechanical obstruction or dysmotility. Patient data and symptom assessment are often helpful in determining the probable cause and guiding subsequent investigation and treatment. Oropharyngeal dysphagia is usually caused by neurological disorders where treatment options are limited. Conversely, many of the esophageal causes of dysphagia are amenable to therapy. Because of its diagnostic and therapeutic potential, gastroscopy is often the first test of choice, especially when mechanical causes are involved. Esophageal motor function can be assessed using a variety of techniques ranging from radiology, such as barium swallow, to specialized motility tests, such as manometry and impedance monitoring. The choice of test depends on the clinical indication and the results should be interpreted in conjunction with the patient's symptoms. High resolution manometry with topography is now the new benchmark for motility studies. Several new techniques for motility testing have also become available, such as B. esophageal ultrasound and functional lumen imaging probe, but these are currently limited to the research setting.

1584,New novel mutation of the ATP7B gene in a family with Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The WD gene codes for a copper-transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7B) are located on chromosome 13q14.3. Mutation of this gene disrupts copper homeostasis, resulting in accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, kidneys, and corneas and copper poisoning at these sites. Since the WD gene was identified in 1993, approximately 300 disease-specific mutations have been identified. We recently evaluated a Korean family with WD. The subject, a 17-year-old boy, presented to our hospital for abnormal behavior including generalized slow movements, dysphagia, drooling and ataxia. Laboratory results showed decreases in serum copper and ceruloplasmin and increases in urinary copper excretion. He had liver cirrhosis, brain lesions and Kayser-Fleischer core rings. Molecular genetic analysis of the ATP7B gene showed that it was heterozygous for the c.2697-2723del27 deletion mutation in exon 11. Further research from family members revealed that his father and younger brother had the same mutation. The c.2697-2723del27 deletion mutation in exon 11 has not yet been reported as a causative mutation of WD and is an in-frame deletion not expected to result in a frame shift. Therefore, we report a new mutation of the ATP7B gene in a family with WD. © 2011 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Lee, J. Y.;Kim, Y. H.;Kim, T. W.;Oh, S. Y.;Kim, D. S.;Shin, B.

Our goal was to describe the diverse patterns, therapies, and outcomes of this disease. DESIGN AND SETTING: A two-decade retrospective study of WM patients at a tertiary care center in Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and laboratory findings of 71 patients with WD were extracted from their medical records, referral notes, and our electronic hospital records and analyzed. Results: The mean age and standard deviation was 16.8 (10.7) years and 56.5% were males. The main manifestations of WM were hepatic, neurological and mixed in 39 (54.9%), 12 (16.9%) and 20 (28.2%) patients, respectively, and 11 (15.5%) were asymptomatic cases due to family screening were discovered. Forty-one (57.7%) patients had a positive family history and 26 (36.6%) patients had parental consanguinity. The mean (SD) follow-up time was 92.2 (72.9) (range 1-320) months. Ten (14.1%) patients died during follow-up, while 45 (63.4%) and 16 (22.5%), respectively, were still attending or had lost follow-up. The mean (SD) age at the end of follow-up was 25.3 (12) (range 4-62) years. A hepatoma was discovered in 5 (7.0%) patients. Penicillamine therapy was used by 58 (81.7%) patients, while zinc and trientine were used by 32 (45.1%) and 11 (15.5%) patients, respectively. Sixteen (22.5%) patients underwent liver transplantation and one (1.4%) died on the wait-list. Liver status remained stable or improved in 35 (49.3%) and neurological status showed improvement in 11 (34.4%) of the 32 patients with neurological involvement. Conclusions: This is the largest cohort reported from the Middle East.

1591,Urinary copper excretion before and after oral administration of D-penicillamine in parents of patients with Wilson's disease,"Background: urinary copper excretion greater than 100 mug/24. h is useful for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. The d-penicillamine challenge test can yield higher concentrations than 1400 cups/24. h, allowing for better diagnostic accuracy. This study examined whether heterozygotes reach this level and compared serum copper levels, ceruloplasmin, and urinary copper excretion before and after administration of D-penicillamine to the parents of patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: Fifty parents of adult patients were enrolled to obtain serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin along with 24-hour urinary copper excretion before and after administration of 1.0 g d-penicillamine. Results: Serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels were significantly lower in fathers than in mothers (mean 21.8 x 27.8 mg%; 71.4 x 88.0 mg%; p<= 0.001). The mean basal 24-hour urinary copper excretion was higher in fathers (26.2 x 18.7 µg/24 h, p = 0.01), but did not differ between sexes after D-penicillamine (521, 7 x 525.3, range 31.6-1085.1 µg). /24. h, p=0.8). Conclusions: The mean values of serum copper, ceruloplasmin and basal urinary copper excretion were different in males and females. The current diagnostic threshold of 24-hour urinary copper excretion after d-penicillamine was not reached by heterozygotes. The increased urinary copper excretion after d-penicillamine challenge was much greater than five times the upper limit of normal urinary copper excretion in the majority of heterozygotes and should not be considered in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. © 2011 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana Srl",,"Vieira, J.;Oliveira, P.

1593,Surgery in a patient with liver disease,"Surgery is often required in patients with co-existing liver disease. The multiple physiological functions of the liver put these patients at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Conditions that require surgery, such as gallstones and hernias, are more common in patients with cirrhosis. Assessing the severity of liver dysfunction before surgery is important, and the risk-benefit of the procedure must be carefully evaluated. The severity of the disease can range from a slight increase in transaminases to decompensated cirrhosis. Surgery should be avoided if possible in emergency cases, in acute and alcoholic hepatitis, in patients with pediatric class C cirrhosis or with a MELD score greater than 15, or in any patient with significant extrahepatic organ dysfunction. In this subgroup of patients, all possible means of conservative management of these patients should be tried. Modified Child-Pugh scores and MELD (end-stage liver disease model) scores can predict mortality after surgery, including non-hepatic abdominal surgery, fairly reliably. Preoperative optimization would include control of ascites, correction of electrolyte imbalance, improvement of renal dysfunction, cardiorespiratory assessment, and correction of coagulation. Global hemostasis tests such as thrombelastography and thrombin formation time can predict bleeding risk better than traditional coagulation tests in patients with cirrhosis. Correcting the internationally normalized ratio with fresh frozen plasma does not necessarily reduce the risk of bleeding and may increase the risk of volume overload and lung damage. The internationally normalized ratio liver can better reflect the coagulation status. Recombinant Factor VIIa in patients with cirrhosis who require surgery needs further investigation. Intraoperatively, safe anesthetics such as isoflurane and propofol are recommended to avoid hypotension. In general, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and benzodiazepines should not be used. Intra-abdominal surgery in a patient with cirrhosis becomes more difficult in the presence of ascites, portal hypertension, and hepatomegaly. Uncontrolled bleeding due to coagulopathy and portal hypertension, sepsis, renal dysfunction and worsening liver failure contribute to morbidity and mortality in these patients. Steps must be taken to reduce ascites leaks and infections. Any patient with cirrhosis who undergoes major surgery should be referred to a specialized center experienced in treating liver disease. © 2012 INASL.",,"Rai, R.;Nagral, S.;Nagral, A.",2012,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2012.05.003,0,0,

1596,Role of the human high-affinity copper transporter in regulation of copper homeostasis and cisplatin sensitivity in cancer chemotherapy,"The high-affinity copper transporter (Ctr1; SCLC31A1) plays an important role in regulating copper homeostasis because copper is an essential micronutrient and copper deficiency impairs many important cellular functions, but excess copper is toxic. Recent research has shown that human copper homeostasis is tightly controlled by interregulatory circuits involving copper, Sp1 and human (hCtr1). This circuit uses the Sp1 transcription factor as a copper sensor in modulating hCtr1 expression, which in turn controls cellular copper and Sp1 levels in a three-way mutual regulatory loop. The post-translational regulation of hCtr1 expression by copper stress has also been described in the literature. Since hCtr1 can also transport platinum drugs, this finding underscores the important role of hCtr1 in sensitivity to platinum drugs in cancer chemotherapy. Consistent with this notion is the finding that increased hCtr1 expression was associated with favorable outcomes in cisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy. Furthermore, studies in cultured cells showed that increased hCtr1 expression can be induced by decreasing cellular copper levels, leading to increased uptake of cisplatin and its cell-killing activity. A phase I clinical trial of a combination of trientine (a copper chelator) and carboplatin has been conducted with encouraging results. This review article discusses new insights into the role of hCtr1 in regulation of copper homeostasis and explains how modulation of cellular copper availability could impact treatment efficacy in platinum-based cancer chemotherapy through regulation of hCtr1. © 2012 AACR.",,"Kuo, M.

AIM: To describe the authors' clinical experience with a cohort of 48 adult patients followed in an outpatient setting. METHODS: A retrospective file review of patients diagnosed with WM was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-nine charts were identified and 11 were excluded from further review. At diagnosis, 14 patients were asymptomatic, with 13 hepatic, 15 neurological, and six mixed hepatic/neurological presentations. Ceruloplasmin levels were low (< 0.20 g/L) in 94% of cases and 24-hour urinary copper levels were high (> 0.60 µmol/L) in 95% of cases. D-penicillamine was the most common initial therapy (48%), with zinc being the most common at review (65%). Overall, biopsy and ultrasound reports documented cirrhosis in 53%. Portal hypertension, defined as splenomegaly (>12.0 cm), reverse portal venous flow on ultrasound, or varices/gastropathy on endoscopy was observed in 63%. At last check, 39% had elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (>34 U/L) and/or alanine aminotransferase (>40 U/L). One death and one transplantation occurred, while three patients suffered from encephalopathy, two developed jaundice, two developed ascites and one developed variceal bleeding. Of 21 neurological patients, 14 improved compared to baseline, with four recovering almost completely. Eleven patients had documented episodes of neurological deterioration, including four with non-neurological presentations.

Although treatable, there is no universally accepted treatment regimen. Currently, various Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) are widely used in China to treat Wilson's disease, but there is a lack of reliable scientific evidence on the effectiveness of such therapies. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of CHM as an alternative and/or adjuvant therapy for Wilson's disease. A systematic literature search of various medical databases was performed to identify randomized controlled trials comparing CHM as monotherapy or CHM as adjuvant therapy to Western conventional medicine therapy in the treatment of Wilson's disease. A total of 687 participants were enrolled in nine eligible studies. The main results are that CHM as monotherapy or adjuvant therapy in Wilson's disease may be able to improve clinical symptoms, promote urinary copper excretion, improve liver function and/or liver cirrhosis and have fewer side effects compared to Western conventional drugs has drug. In addition, CHM appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated in patients with Wilson's disease. However, due to the generally low methodological quality of the included studies, the evidence presented in this review is not sufficient to justify a clinical recommendation. In conclusion, CHM appears to be beneficial and safe for Wilson disease, but high-quality evidence is still needed to further evaluate this therapy.

1602,Excretion of metal elements in the 24-hour urine in patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to copper accumulation and resulting toxicity. D-penicillamine, a powerful metal chelator, is an important therapy for Wilson's disease. To study the changes of metal elements under treatment with D-penicillamine, we determined the concentrations of Cu, Zn, Mg, Ca, Fe, Se, Mn, Pb, Hg, Cd, As, Tl and Al by ICP-MS im 24-hour urine from 115 patients with Wilson's disease who had received maintenance doses of D-penicillamine for 1 month to 22 years and from 115 age-matched healthy controls. The concentrations of Cu, Mg, Ca, Zn, Hg, Pb, Tl, Cd, and Mn in the 24-hour urine of the cases were significantly higher than those of the controls (P < 0.05), and the increases in the concentrations observed of Mg, Ca and Zn correlated directly with treatment duration with a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.356 (Mg), 0.329 (Ca) and 0.313 (Zn) respectively (P<0.05). On the other hand, 24-hour urine Al and As levels were lower than controls (P<0.05) and negatively correlated with treatment time, with R of -0.337 (Al) and -0.398 (As) and (P < 0.05). Thus, this study indicates that concentrations of metal elements may be altered in patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",,"Huang, L.;Zhang, J.;Liu, X.;Zhang, Y.;Jiao, X.;Yu, X.",2012,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-011-9250-3,0,0,

1608,Wilson's disease: why talk about it. [Italian],"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism characterized by progressive copper accumulation in the liver and then in other organs such as the nervous system, eyes and kidneys. In childhood, the clinical presentation of WM is usually characterized by signs of liver disease, while the typical neurological symptoms are rarely observed. The hepatic clinical presentation varies greatly between different settings. In Italy, the majority of pediatric patients with WM are recruited after evidence of isolated hypertransaminasemia. Early detection of WD is desirable to avoid the dramatic progression of the hepatic and neurological diseases. Unfortunately, early detection is a challenging task, especially in childhood, since the conventional criteria for adults are not always suitable for children. The drugs currently available are D-penicillamine and zinc, which work with different mechanisms. None of the available drugs are free of side effects.

1611,Quality of life and psychiatric symptoms in Wilson's disease: The relevance of bipolar disorders,"Introduction: Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder caused by a gene on chromosome 13 that involves the transport of copper across cell membranes. The disease can lead to reduced incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin, leading to accumulation of this metal in the liver, central nervous system, kidneys and other organs. The aim is to define the frequencies of psychiatric disorders in MM, the extent of impairment of quality of life [QoL] in patients with MM, and the relevance of psychiatric disorders to the QoL of people with MM. Methods: This is a systematic review. Relevant articles were searched for in PubMed using specific keywords. Results: Like other neurological disorders, WM is characterized by a chronic course and need for treatment, impairment of functional outcomes, and a high frequency of psychiatric symptoms, although a specific association between bipolar disorder and WM has recently been identified. Despite this, only a few studies on the quality of life of WM patients in the context of psychiatric symptoms have been conducted to date. Some recent reports have shown an association between a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, cerebral damage and poor quality of life. Conclusion: Prospective studies in large cohorts are needed to determine the effective impact of comorbidity of psychiatric disorders, particularly bipolar disorder, on quality of life in WM and to clarify the causal relationship between brain damage, psychiatric disorders and deterioration in quality of life. © Carta et al.",,"Carta, M.

1615,Decreased serum antioxidant capacity in patients with Wilson's disease is associated with neurological symptoms,"Background and Aims Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited copper disposition disorder caused by mutation of the ATP7B transporter gene, resulting in copper accumulation in predisposed tissues. In addition to a genetic predisposition, other factors are likely to contribute to the clinical manifestation. The aim of the study was to assess whether oxidative stress affects the phenotypic manifestation of WD. Methods In 56 patients with MB (29 males; 26 with hepatic form, 22 with neurological form and eight asymptomatic; mean age 38.5 +/- 12 years), serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and inflammatory parameters (hs-CRP, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha) were analyzed and associated with clinical manifestation and mutations of the ATP7B gene. The control group for TAC and inflammatory parameters consisted of 50 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Results WM patients had significantly lower TAC (p<0.00001), lower IL-10 levels (p=0.039), and both higher IL-1beta (p=0.019) and IL-6 levels (p= 0.005) compared to the control subjects. TNF-alpha, hs-CRP and IL-2 did not differ from controls. Patients with the neurological form of WD had a significantly lower TAC than patients with the hepatic form (p<0.001). In addition, the lower TAC was associated with the severity of neurological symptoms (p=0.02). No connection was found between the inflammatory parameters and the clinical symptoms. Conclusions Data from our study suggest that increased oxidative stress contributes significantly to the clinical manifestation of WM; as a lower TAC is associated with neurological symptoms in WM patients. © SSIEM and Springer 2011.",,"Bruha, R.;Vitek, L.;Marecek, Z.;Pospisilova, L.;Nevsimalova, S.;Martasek, P.;Petrtyl, J.;Urbanek, P.;Jiraskova, A.;Malikova, I.;Haluzik, M.;Ferenci, P.",2012,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10545-011-9422-5,0,0,
1616,Zinc and mesentery: Ein Update,"The importance of micronutrients for health and nutrition is undisputed, and among them zinc is an essential element, the importance of which for health is increasingly appreciated and the lack of which can play an important role in the development of diseases. Zinc is one of the most important trace elements in the organism, with three important biological roles: catalytic, structural and regulatory. Zinc-binding motifs are found in many proteins physiologically encoded by the human genome, and free zinc is primarily regulated at the single-cell level. Zinc has critical effects on homeostasis, immune function, oxidative stress, apoptosis and aging, and significant disorders of major public health concern are associated with zinc deficiency. In many chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, multiple malignancies, neurological disorders, autoimmune diseases, aging, age-related degenerative diseases and Wilson's disease, simultaneous zinc deficiency can complicate clinical features, adversely affect the immunological status, increase oxidative stress and lead to the formation of inflammatory ones cytokines. Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation can play an important causal role in these diseases. It is therefore important that zinc status is assessed in all cases and zinc deficiency corrected as zinc's unique properties can have significant therapeutic benefits in these diseases. In the present work, we discuss zinc as a multipurpose trace element, its biological role in homeostasis, proliferation and apoptosis, and its role in immunity and in chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, depression, Wilson's disease, Alzheimer's and other age-related diseases. © Springer Verlag 2011.",,"Chasapis, C.

1617,Wilson's disease with normal liver function and low copper levels: an unusual presentation,"OBJECTIVE 1: Diagnosis of Wilson's disease in a patient with normal liver function and low serum copper. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Recognize Wilson's disease in young patients with Parkinson's characteristics. CASE: A 24-year-old, previously healthy woman was hospitalized with recurrent numbness and headache accompanied by Parkinson's symptoms (tremors, slurred speech, and drooling with difficulty swallowing). She had a significant family history of psychiatric illnesses in her mother and sister. Physical examination revealed only mild dysarthria and subjective weakness on the left side. Initial laboratory data including CBC, basal metabolic panel, liver function tests, thyroid function, ESR, CRP, Lyme PCR, HIV and RPR/VDRL were all negative. She had a normal CSF exam with negative paraneoplastic panel, IgG index, viral studies and cryptococcal antigen. The urinalysis was unremarkable and the urine drug test was inconclusive. Autoimmune testing including ANA and rheumatoid factor was negative. A CT scan of the head showed abnormal, symmetrical, diffuse hypodensities of the bilateral basal ganglia. An MRI to further assess the soft tissue abnormalities showed an increased T2 signal within the right and left lens nuclei. A heavy metal bezel was ordered. Arsenic, mercury, lead, cadmium and copper levels were all low. Due to the high level of suspicion, an extremely low ceruloplasmin value of 3.1 mg/dL (normal: 14 - 78 mg/dL) was ordered. Liver biopsy revealed mild chronic active hepatitis grade 2, stage 3 septal fibrosis and retained copper in hepatocytes, confirming the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. An ophthalmological examination under a slit lamp showed clear Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings. She was started on trientine and zinc and at subsequent follow-up her KF rings disappeared and neurological symptoms showed modest improvement. DISCUSSION: Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) is an autosomal recessive defect in copper export with a prevalence rate of one in 30,000 live births. It is caused by decreased biliary excretion of copper, resulting in accumulation in the liver and subsequently progressing to other organs. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation combined with physical, biochemical, and histological findings. Neurological disorders (present in 35 percent of patients) include Parkinson's tremor, stiffness and clumsiness of gait, speech problems, and drooling. Ten percent of patients present with psychiatric symptoms ranging from subtle personality changes to overt depression, catatonia, and paranoia. Serum aminotransferases are usually elevated, but their severity does not correlate with histological liver damage. Total body copper levels are elevated, but serum levels may be low in patients with low ceruloplasmin levels. If symptoms are exclusively neurological with normal liver function and low copper levels, a slit lamp examination to look for KF rings should be considered. If positive, this strongly suggests Wilson's disease. Liver biopsy may be needed to further confirm the diagnosis.",,"Gulati, G.;Gulati, S.;Nguyen, H. P.",2012,July,,0,0,
1618,"riddle shrouded in mystery, but maybe there is a key!","LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Discuss the differential diagnosis of cirrhosis in a young adult. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Discuss the importance of working up Wilson's disease with diagnostic procedures, the importance of strong clinical suspicion, and continuity of care and communication between healthcare providers. CASE: A 26-year-old woman with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, diagnosed at age 22, presented in December 2011 with a 2-week history of abdominal pain and abdominal swelling. With the loss of insurance approximately 10 months ago, she was unable to maintain proper dosing of Lactulose and Lasix and became dependent on the many subsequent emergency room visits for acute care. Pain characteristics were: sharp, squeezing, tenderness, diffuse throughout the abdomen, and with a severity rating of up to 10/10. She complained of some nausea and vomiting, fever, and episodes of altered mental status. On examination she was fever-free, normotensive and had no acute symptoms. She had significant scleral jaundice and no apparent mental status changes. The abdomen was firm and distended, tender to palpation with a positive surge of fluid and mild splenomegaly. Abnormal laboratory values: hemoglobin 10.7, hematocrit 32.1, hepatitis panel negative, alkaline phosphatase 532, AST 132, total bilirubin 24.8 (direct 13.6; indirect 11.2), MELD score 26 and her Child-Pugh -Score of 10, PTT of 36, PT 29.7 and INR of 1.88. Review of her previous records from 2010 revealed normal serum ceruloplasmin levels, a 24-hour copper excretion of 34, and a positive liver biopsy for copper, but with no quantification. Mutation of antimitochondrial antibody, ANA and hemochromatosis gene was negative. She had been treated for depression and substance abuse (EtOH), which meant she did not qualify for a liver transplant. However, upon further questioning, we found that she had only recently used alcohol to cope after losing her insurance. Our work-up revealed a weak Kayser-Fleischer ring, a ceruloplasmin level of 20.1, an elevated 24-hour copper count of 86, and a copper/creatinine ratio of 78. At that point, we concluded that they met the diagnostic criteria for Wilson's disease and initiated treatment with D-penicillamine. DISCUSSION: Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive (ATP7B gene) disorder of copper transport with a prevalence of approximately 1/30000. Typical presentation includes neurological and hepatic dysfunction. Diagnosis usually requires a high clinical index of suspicion due to the overlap of symptoms with other disorders. Delays and misdiagnosis are not uncommon, as in our case, particularly when there is a possible history of substance abuse and when the lack of insurance becomes a limiting factor in providing adequate follow-up and care. Therefore, the importance of continuity of care and communication between physicians cannot be overstated. Diagnostic criteria include: presence of Kayser-Fleishcer rings on the slit lamp, ceruloplasmin < 0.20 g/l, 24-hour urinary excretion of free copper, penicillamine challenge test, liver copper measurement and the presence of a abnormal gene mutation. Mainstays of therapy are penicillamine, trientine and zinc. In advanced disease, as in our patient, long-term treatment is liver transplantation.",,"Sapkota, S.

1619,A case of acute copper poisoning,"LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Wilson disease, also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is due to an autosomal recessive defect in copper transport. Ceruloplasmin represents circulating copper in plasma. Hepatic production of apoceruloplasmin, ceruloplasmin without copper, causes the low serum ceruloplasmin level found in patients with Wilson's disease. In addition, inappropriate function of the Wilson disease protein, ATP7B, results in impairment of biliary copper excretion, allowing accumulation and deposition of copper in the hepatic, neurological, renal, and ophthalmic systems. Important clinical features of the disease are cirrhosis, acute liver failure, movement disorders, psychosis and premature osteoporosis. CASE: 25-year-old male with a history of panhypopituitarism s/p removal of a suprasellar mass secondary to Langerhan's histiocytosis, presenting with altered mental status, generalized weakness and lethargy. Remarkably, he had stopped using his DDAVP for several weeks. On admission he was found to have a serum sodium level of 172. He was immediately started on pituitary hormone replacement therapy, which included desmopressin, solucorref, and synthroid. In addition, he was found to have new elevated liver function values, ammonia and INR. Originally it was believed that his altered mentality was a combination of hypernatremia and liver dysfunction. As a result, he received lactulose and rifaximin. His sodium levels improved but he remained encephalopathic. His acute liver failure was further examined gastroenterologically and hepatologically. Diagnostic laboratory tests revealed low ceruloplasmin, high serum copper and increased urine copper. He then underwent a liver biopsy which revealed stage III-IV portal fibrosis and steatosis and stage II-IV portal and parenchymal infiltrates, both consistent with Wilson's disease. He was started on pencillamine which resulted in an immediate improvement in his mental state. The release of the ATP7B gene was pending. He is undergoing an outpatient slit lamp examination. He was discharged home with close gastroenterological and hepatological follow-up. DISCUSSION: Wilson disease should be considered in any person aged 3 to 55 years with liver abnormalities of unexplained cause and must be ruled out in any patient with unexplained liver disease accompanied by rapid neurological deterioration. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease is made by slit-lamp examination to identify Kayser-Fleischer rings, which represent a deposit of copper in the Decemet membrane of the cornea. Biochemical tests show elevated liver function tests, low ceruloplasmin levels and high serum and urinary copper excretions. Elevated levels of copper in the liver parenchyma provide important diagnostic information and should be sought in cases where the diagnosis is not straightforward. Histologic abnormalities found on liver biopsy include steatosis, hepatocellular necrosis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. If the diagnosis remains elusive, molecular genetic testing such as the ATP7B mutation can be done. Treatment options include d-penicillamine, a chelator that increases urinary copper excretion, trientine (also a chelator), indicated in patients who cannot tolerate pencillamine, and zinc, which decreases the absorption of copper from the gastrointestinal tract. tract disturbs.",,"Patel, P.;Andhavarapu, K.;Shah, P.;Menon, N.;Feldman, J.",2012,July,,0,0,

In rare cases, fulminant liver failure and multiple organ dysfunction can occur. Initial therapy aims to reduce the high serum copper levels characteristic of Wilson's disease. Because copper is bound to albumin, we evaluated the efficacy of 2 extracorporeal copper clearance modalities: Molecular Adsorbant Recirculating System (MARS) and Plasmapheresis (PP). A 25-year-old woman with WD on Trientine presented with fulminant WD (hemolytic anemia, liver failure, AKI) due to non-compliance with medication for 1 year. Blood copper (Cu), haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin levels were monitored. Treatments alternated between MARS and PP. MARS sessions consisted of 8 hours of albumin dialysis, each followed by CVVHDF. PP sessions replaced 1.2 times the plasma volume with FFP. Copper reduction ratios (CRR) for each modality are shown in the table. The patient was bridged to liver transplantation after a total of 5 sessions (3 MARS and 2 PP). In this case, the mean CRR for MARS and PP was similar (18.6% vs. 26.9%, p=0.5).

1624,Wilson's disease: abnormal methionine metabolism and the role of inflammation and steatosis in early stages of liver disease,"Purpose of the study: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive copper transport disorder characterized by hepatic copper accumulation and development of hepatic steatosis. Copper has been shown to inhibit the enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH), which is central to methionine metabolism and the regulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels. The SAM/SAH ratio is an indicator of methylation ability and regulates gene expression. This study investigates the effects of copper-induced SAHH inhibition and copper-chelator penicillamine (PCA) treatment on the pathogenesis of inflammation and steatosis in an animal model of WD to establish a link between methionine metabolism and the regulation of gene expression. Methods used: Livers and blood were collected from 7 toxic milk (tx-j) and 7 C3H control mice in each age group at 12 and 24 weeks and 7 PCA-treated tx-j mice at 24 weeks. We measured the metabolites of methionine metabolism SAM and SAH (HPLC) and SAHH activity. Fat metabolism genes glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78), sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP 1c), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1alpha (CPT-1alpha), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) were per Real time PCR measured. Summary of Results: Hepatic copper levels in tx-j mice were 35-40 times higher than controls (p<0.0001), while PCA-tx-j mice accumulated half as much copper as untreated tx-j mice (p<0.0001). At 24 weeks, SAHH activity was reduced in tx-j mice (p=0.01) but recovered in PCA-tx-j mice similar to controls. The SAM/SAH ratio was lower in PCA and untreated tx-j mice (p<0.05). The expression of GRP78, SREBP 1c, CPT-1alpha and PPARalpha was reduced in untreated tx-j mice at both ages and further reduced in PCA-tx-j mice. TNFalpha expression was higher in untreated tx-j mice but decreased in PCA-tx-j mice. Conclusions: Copper accumulation is associated with inhibition of SAHH activity in tx-j mice, which was restored in PCA-tx-j mice. The SAM/SAH ratio was reduced in PCA and untreated tx-j mice with changes in inflammatory and steatosis gene expression. These findings indicate that copper-induced abnormal methionine metabolism and subsequent inflammation and csteatosis play an important role in the pathogenesis of early liver disease in WM.",,"Dolatshahi, M.;Shibata, N.;Liu, S.;Halsted, C.;Medici, V.",2012,January,http://dx.doi.org/10.231/JIM.0b013e318240c940,0,0,
1625,Usefulness of dynamic hepatobiliary scintigraphy in Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive copper transport disorder due to defective hepatocyte-biliary copper excretion leading to pathologic copper accumulation in many organs and tissues, primarily the liver and brain. Clinical manifestations associated with hepatic copper accumulation include liver disease ranging from mild hepatitis to acute liver failure or cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of dynamic hepatobiliary scintigraphy (DHBS) in the assessment of liver dysfunction in patients with Wilson's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DHBS with 99mTc-mebrofenin was performed in 39 consecutive WM patients treated with zinc and/or penicillamine (19 males and 20 females; mean age 39 +/- 4 years) with clinical signs of liver disease. All patients underwent standardized biochemical liver function tests including ALT, AST, GGT, AP, TOT BIL, ALB, serum copper and ceruloplasmin, and 24-hour urinary copper excretion. Liver biopsies were performed in all WM patients. Liver tissue was examined for routine liver histology (grading and staging of fibrosis) and liver copper content. DHBS was performed after 110 MBq99mTc-Mebrofenin iv injection by time/frame acquisition of 30 seconds for 60 minutes. Time-activity curves were recorded from regions of interest located over the liver parenchyma (H) and the common intrahepatic bile ducts (B). Quantitative analysis of the curves was performed using deconvolution analysis and nonlinear regression, comparing the time to maximum peak count intraparenchimal (HTmax) and intraductal (BTmax) and the time to T1/2 shedding (HT1/2; BT1/2) . Results: All patients had low serum caeruplasmin or copper levels (3.05 +/- 0.2 mg/dl and 57 +/- 18 mg/dl) and high 24-hour urinary copper excretion (201 +/- - 42 mg/24 hours). According to Metavir fibrosis staging, 16 patients (41%) were classified as F1, 7 as F2 (18%), 10 as F3 (25%) and the remaining 6 as F4 (16%). Analysis of quantitative DHBS data showed that almost all patients had slow hepatic uptake (>HTmax) and hepatobiliary clearance (>HT1/2). A positive correlation was observed between histological findings and Htmax (p=0.001), HT1/2 (p=0.006) and BTmax (p=0.02) values. Furthermore, in the multivariate analysis, a significant correlation was found between HTmax, HT1/2 BT1/2 and high grade of fibrosis (F4) compared to the other grades of fibrosis. No correlation was found between biochemical liver function tests, but bilirubin; (p<0.01) and DHBS parameters. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the clinical utility of DHBS as a non-invasive diagnostic modality for assessing the degree of liver fibrosis, allowing to reduce the number of liver biopsies in the long-term follow-up of patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Serra, A.;Sorbello, O.;Loi, G.;Mighela, M.;Faa, G.;Demelia, L.;Piga, M.",2012,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00259-012-222-x,0,0,
1626,A precious metal: copper deficiency as myeloneuropathy,"Background: Copper deficiency is a rare cause of hematological and neurological diseases. We describe a case of copper deficiency mimicking subacute combined degeneration of the umbilical cord. METHODS: A 65-year-old woman presented with leg weakness, vertigo, and paresthesia in the hands and legs. She was known to have celiac disease and B12 and folate deficiencies, with erratic compliance with B12 injections. There were no features of inflammatory joint or muscle disease or underlying autoimmune connective tissue disease. Neurological examination revealed normal tone and strength with brisk reflexes. She had a mid-thigh sensory plane with reduced proprioception to the ankles and absent vibration sense to the hips. Sensory ataxia and a positive Romberg test were demonstrated. Her clinical picture indicated a combined myeloneuropathy. Actual or functional B12 deficiency was suspected based on their medical history. MRI spine and nerve conduction studies showed no specific changes. Blood tests including B12, folate, inflammatory markers and autoimmune profile were normal. However, the copper studies were abnormal, with low serum copper levels of 2.3 [normal range 11-20], ceruloplasmin 0.1 [NR 0.2-0.6] and zinc 6.1 [NR 11-24]. She was diagnosed with copper deficiency. With oral copper supplementation, her symptoms have improved. Results: Copper deficiency is recognized as a cause of myelopathy in humans and other animals, particularly ruminants. Copper chelators are used in animal models to model demyelination and neurodegenerative phenomena. In humans it has been observed after gastric bypass surgery or after excessive use of zinc-based denture adhesives, although many cases are idiopathic. The disease may mimic subacute combined spinal cord degeneration, optic neuropathy, or myelodysplasia with refractory anemia and other cytopenias. Copper deficiency myelopathy is more common in women and peaks in the 5th and 6th decade. This picture is not seen in Wilson's disease, but in cases of clinical doubt, copper deficiency can be diagnosed by detecting low levels of copper in the urine. MRI of the spine may show an increased T2 signal in the posterior cervical and thoracic cords. It is unclear how copper deficiency causes neurodegeneration or why it resembles other deficiency-related neurodegenerative conditions. Dysfunction of cytochrome oxidase and the methylation process involved in myelin protein synthesis may explain both the pathogenesis and the similarity between the phenotypes. Conclusions: Copper deficiency is a rare cause of neurodegenerative symptoms that can mimic other diseases. A combination of myelopathy and cytopenia is particularly suspicious. Physicians should be alert to this possibility, particularly in patients with risk factors such as malabsorption, bariatric surgery, or megadoses of zinc. After treatment, the cytopenias usually resolve, but neurological recovery is often incomplete.",,"Hayes, F.;Coward, L.;Borg, F.",2012,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/kes108,0,0,
1627,"Clinical, biochemical and radiological profile of Wilson's disease and effect of treatment","Objectives: To study the clinical, biochemical and radiological profile of Wilson's disease (WD) and the effect of treatment. METHODS: This study was performed on 31 patients who underwent a detailed clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Corneal slit-lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring, biochemical studies (including serum ceruloplasmin, copper and urinary copper), and neuroimaging were performed in all patients. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 12.41 years and the mean delay in diagnosis was 16.96 months. Twenty-four (77.4%) patients were adolescents (less than 18 years of age) and 7 (22.6%) were adults (over 18 years of age). Dystonia was the most common initial neurologic feature (64.5%), followed by dysarthria (41.9%), salivation (38.7%), and parkinsonism (38.7%). Parkinson group (64.5%), cerebellar group (22.6%) and the choreoathetoid group (9.7%). Psychiatric complaints (41.9%), seizures (19.4%) and headache (22.5%) were also observed. Bilateral KF ring was seen in all patients. Non-neuropsychiatric features (bleeding, hepatosplenomegaly and arthralgia) were predominantly observed in adolescents. Serum ceruloplasmin was low (< 20 mg/dl) in 93.54% of patients, 24-hour urinary copper (> 100 micrograms/day) was elevated in all patients, and serum copper was elevated in 64.5% of patients patients low (< 75 micrograms/dL). MRI of the brain was performed in 27 patients, with signal changes in the basal ganglia being the most common finding (85.2%). Brain CT was performed in 4 patients, with basal ganglia hypodensity being the most common finding (75%). All patients were treated with zinc and penicillamine. Twenty-three (74.2%) patients were treated regularly, with neurological deterioration occurring in 16 (51.6%) patients. 13 (41.9%) patients improved completely; 12 (38.7%) patients showed incomplete improvement with sequelae; 4 (12.9%) patients remained status quo and were lost in follow-up and 2 (6.45%) patients deteriorated and died. Conclusions: This series of WD from East India underlines that the disease is not that rare in India and has varied clinical presentations. Dystonia and parkinsonian features predominated in juvenile patients, while cerebellar features predominated in the adult group. All asymptomatic siblings must be screened for WD. Early diagnosis and the right treatment can prevent devastating consequences.",,"Kumar, N.;Joshi, D.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00415-012-6524-4,0,1,
1628,Therapeutic efficacy of trientine dihydrochloride-encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles in the rat model of copper toxicity with neurobehavioural disorders,"Animal models of Wilson's disease (WD), viz. Long Evans cinnamon rats rarely show neurological symptoms, which hampers the development of novel therapeutic approaches such as nanoparticle-based drug delivery across the BBB to treat neurological manifestations in WD patients. The aim of this study was to (1) investigate the effects of intraperitoneally injected copper lactate daily for 90 days, specifically on copper levels in brain tissue, expression of metallothionein-I (MT-I) and Atp7b genes in liver, and MT-III & acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene in brain (by reverse transcription PCR) and neurobehavioral functions (by Morris water maze) of male Wistar rats. (2) Evaluation of orally administered copper chelator trientine dihydrochloride encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles for 90 days in copper-poisoned Wistar rats. Animals given copper showed significantly increased levels of ceruloplasmin, serum and urine copper, decreased serum AChE activity, increased expression of the hepatic MT-I gene with impaired neuromuscular coordination and spatial memory. Autopsy studies in copper-poisoned rats showed a significant increase in copper levels in the liver and brain (increase of 99.1% and 73%, respectively), decreased zinc levels in the liver (decrease of 40%) and, interestingly, increased zinc levels in the brain (increase of 77. 1%) compared to controls rats. Deposition of copper in liver and brain tissue and copper-associated proteins in liver tissue of test rats was confirmed by rhodanine and orcein staining, respectively. The nanoparticle-based therapy resulted in a significant reduction in hepatic copper content, serum ceruloplasmin levels and an increase in serum AChE activity. In conclusion, chronic copper toxicity can lead to increased liver and brain copper, increased hepatic MT-I gene expression, high levels of serum copper, ceruloplasmin, urinary copper, and neurobehavioural disorders by altering acetylcholine-modulated neurotransmission disturbs; However, nanoparticles encapsulated in trientine dihydrochloride can significantly reverse impairments from chronic copper poisoning in Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Prasad, R.;Thapa, B.

1629,Rat model of copper toxicity with neurobehavioral impairments,"Animal models of Wilson's disease (WD), viz. Long Evans cinnamon rats rarely show neurological symptoms, which hampers the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat neurological manifestations in WM patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intraperitoneally injected copper lactate (0.15 mg Cu/100 g bw) daily for 90 days on copper and zinc levels in liver, kidney and brain tissue (mainly hippocampal region); Expression of hepatic metallothionein-I (MT-I) and Atp7b gene and MT-III and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene in brain, biochemical parameters and neurobehavioral functions (by Morris water maze test) of male Wistar rats. Animals given copper showed significantly increased serum ceruloplasmin levels, serum and urine copper levels, decreased serum AChE activity, increased expression of hepatic MT-I gene with impaired neuromuscular coordination and spatial memory compared to control rats . Regardless, there were no changes in the expression levels of hepatic Ap7b gene and MT-III and AChE genes in brain tissues of Cu-poisoned rats. Cu-poisoned rats showed a significant increase in Cu content of liver, hippocampal region of brain and kidney tissue (increase by 99.1, 73 and 74.9%, respectively), while hepatic Zn content increased by 40% and Interestingly, the Zn content of the hippocampal region of brain tissues decreased by 77.1% compared to control rats. Histopathological studies showed copper deposition in liver and brain tissue (with swollen astrocytes) and copper-associated proteins in liver tissue from Cu-poisoned rats, which were confirmed by rhodanine and orcein stains, respectively. In summary, the present study presents the first in vivo evidence that chronic Cu toxicity causes neurobehavioural disorders, decreased serum AChE activity, Cu deposition in brain with swollen astrocytes, increased Cu and zinc levels in hippocampus of male Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Prasad, R.;Vasishta, R.

1630,"Presentation of Wilson's disease in Pakistan: An experience in a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan","Background: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism with an average worldwide prevalence of approximately 1 in 30,000 people. Data on WD from Pakistan are not available, so we aim to determine the pattern of WD in the Pakistani population and compare it to international literature. Methods: Cross-sectional study from 1985-2010 conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi. Results: 47 patients were studied, 32 (68.1%) were male with a mean age (SD) of 26.6 (9.97) years. The most common mode of presentation was hepatic; 22 (46.8%) then neurological; 17 (36.2%) and the rest presented with psychiatric symptoms 8 (17%). Patients with psychiatric symptoms had an earlier onset of WM, with a mean age of 18.8 +/- 3.3 years. Mean ceruloplasmin levels were 0.17 (0.13) and reduced (<0.25 g/dL) in 39 (86.6%). Serum (Cu) was reduced in 32 (68.1%). 24-hour urinary copper was increased in only 22 (47.6%). Slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings was performed in 15 (31.9%) patients and KF rings were detected in only 9 (60%) patients. Of these 9 patients with a positive KF ring, 8 (88.8%) had a neurological disease. The mean (AST)/(ALT) ratio was 1.92 and the median was ALP/T. The bilirubin ratio was 79.30 (IQR 35.05; 166.50). Thirty-one (65.4%) patients received a combination of D-penicillamine and zinc (Zn), 11 (23.1%) patients received only D-penicillamine and only 5 (11.5%) received only Zn. Only one patient with decompensated liver disease underwent liver transplantation. Conclusion: Patients with WD present slightly later in adulthood in our population, and hepatic presentation is the most common. The clinical picture and biochemical parameters in Pakistan are no different from the rest of the world. WD should be suspected in patients who have unexplained abnormal liver function tests and a family history of liver disease.",,"Parkash, O.;Ayub, A.;Jafri, W.;Alishah, H.;Hamid, S.",2012,December,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgh.12006,0,1,
1631,Common metabolic liver diseases in children: Wilson's disease,"WiIson's disense (WD), an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, was first described in 1912 by a neurologist, Dr. Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson. Estimated worldwide prevalence is 1 to 30,000-40,000 live births. Although the usual age of onset is between childhood and young adulthood, there have been case reports of extreme cases of WM in a 2-year-old girl and a 72-year-old woman with hepatomegaly and neurological disability, respectively. Clinical manifestations vary widely, including liver disease, neurological disorders, and psychiatric symptoms. These symptoms are usually no different from other common diseases. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is required to guide physicians to properly screen and provide prompt treatment for such a fatal, treatable disease. Mutations in the ATP7B gene lead to a reduction in hepatic copper excretion associated with oxidative stress-induced cell damage in various organs. Numerous mutations have been discovered since 1993. Despite the clear diagnosis from genetic analysis, its routine use has not been widely adopted due to gene length and numerous mutations. WD is therefore conveniently diagnosed by a typical clinical setting with/or without the Kaser-Fleischer ring and some supporting laboratories, including low serum ceruloplasmin (< 0.2 g/L), high 24-hour urinary copper (> 100 cups/day) and high hepatic copper content (>250 cups/g dry weight). Liver transplantation is the ultimate choice of treatment in patients with fulminant liver failure. However, early diagnosis and treatment can prevent and reverse fatal consequences. Copper chelators, pencillamine and/or trientine, have been used with some limitations on their side effects. There is evidence that penicillamine can worsen neurological function; where tetrathiomolybdate and zinc can be good alternatives. The effectiveness and safety of zinc therapy has been demonstrated not only in symptomatic patients, but also in pre-symptomatic patients and those with pregnancy.",,"Ukarapol, N.",2012,December,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgh.12005,0,0,
1632,Prospective pilot study of a single daily dose of trientine for the treatment of Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) requires lifelong drug therapy. Patients who frequently miss their medication doses may develop liver failure, neurological, or psychiatric disorders. Current therapy for WD is with chelating agents or zinc salts given in divided doses. AIM: Prospectively determine whether once-daily trientine is an effective maintenance therapy for WM and improves patient adherence. Methods: The study group consisted of seven male and one female patient between the ages of 22 and 71 years with a stable course of the disease. Patients were treated for their WD between the ages of 4 and 50 years. Presentations of WD included asymptomatic detection by family screening (n=1), random Kayser-Fleischer rings (n=1), neuropsychiatric then liver disease (n=1), and primary liver disease (n=5). Prior treatments were zinc acetate (n=2), d-penicillamine (n=1), and trientine (n=5). After 3 months of monitoring their previous medication, patients were treated with a single daily weight-based dose of trientine (15 mg/kg). Close treatment monitoring included a clinical examination, blood counts and biochemical tests. RESULTS: After 12 months of treatment, all patients were clinically healthy and their clinical examinations were stable throughout the study period. There were no treatment interruptions due to elevated transaminases or side effects. There was no evidence of significant fluctuations in the blood count. Urinary copper excretion increased in patients receiving zinc but was relatively unchanged in patients previously receiving d-penicillamine or trientine. The mean 24-hour urinary excretion of copper and zinc at the end of treatment was 313.4 +/- 191.7 and 2214 +/- 1346 micrograms, respectively. The results of the patient questionnaires at the end of the study, reported by all people in the study group, showed that a major benefit of trientine given in a once-daily dose was the convenience of not increasing the dosages to the recommended dose of one or having to stop two hours before after meals all day. These patients reported that this therapy improved their adherence, two of whom missed more than 5 doses one week prior to the study. CONCLUSIONS: Trientine once daily is an effective maintenance therapy for WM and improves adherence to lifelong medical therapy. Longer term follow-up will demonstrate the safety and treatment efficacy of this once-daily regimen for WD.",,"Ala, A.;Aliu, E.;Schilsky, M.

1633,Long-term results of a large patient cohort with Wilson's disease in Austria,"Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder resulting from impaired hepatic copper excretion leading to copper accumulation in the liver and many other organs. Limited data are available on the long-term outcome of patients with WM. In Austria, 223 patients (2.77/100,000 inhabitants) were diagnosed with WM between 1961 and 2011. A patient moved abroad and could not be reached. METHODS: The 165 living patients or their treating physicians were contacted for information on their current status in 2011. No data were collected for 56 patients. Information on the survival status of these patients was obtained from the Austrian Statistical Office (Statistics Austria, Vienna). The median follow-up was 14.4 years (range: 0.5-49), total: 3028 patient-years. Results: The follow-up study included 222 patients (115 females/107 males; presentation: hepatic: 133; neurological: 57, asymptomatic 22; age at symptom onset 22.3 +/- 12.3 [range: 2-61] Years). 16 patients (7.2%) died during the observation period (in 12 patients death was related to WD - 7 liver decompensation, 3 post liver transplantation (LTX), 1 accident due to neurological impairment, 1 suicide). Twenty-eight (12.6%) patients required LTX (8 fulminant WD, 19 end-stage liver disease, 1 neurological deterioration). LTX was performed within a few months of diagnosis; only 3 patients underwent LTX several years after diagnosis (despite good adherence to therapy). The overall survival rate after 20 years was 92% and thus slightly worse than that of the age-matched Austrian population (97%). The survival of patients living 10 years after diagnosis did not differ from the healthy cohort. 96 versus 99%). 41 (18.4%) made a full recovery and 38 (17.1%) patients improved after initiation of therapy (d-pecillamine or trientine). Most of the remaining patients were stable, only 7 (3.2%) deteriorated despite drug therapy. Clinical follow-up was not performed in 45 patients. Conclusion: WD is associated with severe, often fatal, liver disease. 12.6% require a liver transplant. If patients survive 10 years after starting treatment (drug or transplant), their long-term prognosis in terms of survival and clinical status is excellent. Therefore, early diagnosis and initiation of treatment is imperative to further improve survival and reduce the need for transplantation.",,"Beinhardt, S.;Leiss, W.;Graziadei, I.;Stauber, R.

1634,Wilson's disease: Alterations in methionine metabolism and inflammation affect global DNA methylation in early liver disease,"Hepatic methionine metabolism may play an essential role in the regulation of methylation status and liver injury in Wilson disease (WD) through copper (Cu) inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) and resulting accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAW). is a potent inhibitor of methylation reactions. Methods: We examined transcript levels of Sahh, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), SAH, transcripts of DNA methyltransferase genes (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b), and hepatic global DNA methylation in the toxic milk mouse (tx-j), an animal model of WD and in control C3H mice. Tx-j mice (n=6-7/treatment group, males) received oral penicillamine in deionized water at 100 mg/kg body weight/day from 12 to 24 weeks of age and in separate experiments both tx-j and C3H Mice received the methyl donor betaine supplemented at 1.5% in the drinking water at 20 to 24 weeks of age to modulate the inflammatory or methylation status. Hepatic global DNA methylation was assessed by dot blot analysis and immunostaining was used to detect and quantify 5-methylcytosine in hepatocyte nuclei. Results: In the untreated state, hepatic Sahh transcript and protein levels were reduced in 24-week-old tx-j mice (p<0.05) with a consequent increase in hepatic SAH levels (56.8 +/- - 13 vs. 33.4 +/- 8.5 nmol/g; p<0.05). Hepatic Cu accumulation in tx-j mice (259 +/- 104 vs. 7.2 +/- 1.5 µg/gdw, p<0.001) was associated with inflammation, as determined by liver histology, increased serum ALT (238 +/- 49 vs 36 +/-14 U/L, p<0.001) and elevated liver tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf-alpha) transcript levels (2.9 +/- 1.2 vs -0.56+ /- 1.4-fold changes, p<0.05). Dnmt3b was downregulated in tx-j mice, along with global DNA hypomethylation (about 10% reduction compared to C3H mice). Cu-chelation treatment of tx-j mice with penicillamine reduced Tnf-alpha and ALT levels, betaine treatment increased SAM, increased Dnmt3b levels, and both treatments increased DNA methylation in tx-j to control values. Immunostaining for 5-methylcytosine revealed a diffuse and less intense nuclear staining pattern in the hepatocyte nuclei of tx-j mice (p<0.01). Conclusion: Decreased hepatic Sahh expression was associated with increased hepatic SAH levels in the tx-j model of WD, with consequent global DNA hypomethylation. Increased global DNA methylation has been achieved by enhancing inflammation through Cu chelation or by providing methyl groups. We propose that increased SAH levels and inflammation affect the widespread epigenetic regulation of gene expression in WD.",,"Medici, V.;Kharbanda, K. K.;Woods, R.;LaSalle, J.

1635,Controversies in the diagnosis and treatment of Wilson's disease in children - results of an international survey,"Introduction: In rare pediatric metabolic disorders, insufficient evidence for treatment may lead to treatment variation. The aim of this study is to determine the consensus and differences in the way pediatric hepatologists (PH) diagnose and treat patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Methods: PH, either members of the AASLD Pediatric Liver Special Interest Group or ESPGHAN, were invited to participate in this web-based international survey. Results: Participation was 43% (108 respondents, 253 invitations). The majority (64%) regularly see 1-10 WM patients and 30% see >=11. Publications by Roberts and Schilsky (Hepatology 2008) and Ferenci et al. (Liver Int. 2003) were the preferred guidelines (65% and 21%, respectively). Interpretation and use of laboratory data varied. While for 90% the basal copper excretion in the 24-hour urine (UCE) > 0.6 µmol (40 mg)/24 h indicated the need for further investigations, the definition of the normal liver copper content (LCC) varied (25% interpreted 50 mg /g and 56% 250mg/g as pathologic). Genetic testing is not performed on all patients suspected of having WM in 48% and not at all in 13%, although tests are commercially available. Regardless of disease severity, in patients from previously unaffected families, serum ceruloplasmin (CER), UCE, and LCC were the preferred diagnostic tools. However, once an index patient's genotype was known, DNA analysis was one of three preferred methods (80%). Although not preferred, the penicillamine (PEN) challenge was used similarly in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (20% and 26%, respectively). Screening a child of a person with WD, dependent on CER, UCE and genetic testing, was chosen by 76%. The use of a low-copper diet was assessed differently: 45% recommended indefinitely, 33% temporarily and 12% advised no diet. The drug of choice for primal therapy varied considerably. Zinc monotherapy was preferred in a 4-year-old affected sibling of a WM patient with elevated aminotransferases (43%). In older patients, PEN and Trientine were generally equally preferred, but PEN was opposed by 51% of North American respondents versus 7% of those from other countries. The concepts for treating a WM patient with acute liver failure (ALF) were different. Chelators were chosen as the primary treatment by 52% and transplantation by 15%. Monitoring based on disease severity during the use of medical therapy is the mostly accepted approach. However, 23% said they only monitored without deciding to use chelation therapy or an alternative. Conclusions: The approach to diagnosis and treatment of WM in children due to PH varies significantly. The reasons for these differences in clinical practice are not entirely clear, but likely involve regional differences.",,"Piersma, F. E.;Tanner, S.;Socha, P.;Roberts, E. A.;Shneider, B.

1636,Wilson's disease in Oman: A study of neurological manifestations and diagnostic delays from a university teaching hospital,"Background: There are no comprehensive clinical reports of Wilson's disease [WD, an autosomal recessive disorder (OMIM 277900) of copper transport] in Oman, where there is a high frequency of consanguineous marriages. Aim: To study the neurological, demographic and imaging profiles of WM cases in Oman and determine the time lag in diagnosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: The clinical features and MRI findings of MV cases (attending the neurological service at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Oman) were retrieved from electronic medical records. Patients were also contacted by telephone to determine family history and time lag of diagnosis. Results: We examined a total of 22 cases (13 males and 9 females) from 4 different Omani families. Nine subjects from these families had neurological manifestations, with a mean age of symptom onset of 18 years (range: 12-24). These subjects presented varying combinations and degrees of dystonia, tremor, dysarthria, dysphagia, pyramidal signs and mood disorders. MRI showed basal ganglionic signaling changes in patients with persistent neurologic deficits (n=4). The median time lag at diagnosis was 3 months (range: 0-16 months). Maintenance therapy included penicillamine (n=3), trientine (n=4), and zinc sulfate (n=2). A recent genetic study of one of the 4 families revealed a novel homozygous splice site mutation (C.2866-2A>G) upstream of exon 13 in the copper transporter gene ATP 7B. Conclusions: Dystonia is the most prominent neurological phenotype of WD in Oman.

1637,"An unexpected new antioxidant activity for penicillamine, a classic copper-chelating drug used to treat Wilson's disease","Penicillamine (beta,beta'-dimethylcysteine) has been used extensively clinically as a copper-chelating aminothiol drug to treat copper overload in Wilson's disease. In this study, we found that penicillamine provides significant protection against cytotoxicity in human fibroblasts induced by tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ), a major toxic metabolite of the widely used wood preservative pentachlorophenol, while other classical copper chelating agents such as bathocuproine disulfonate do not. The auto-oxidation process of TCHQ yielding the reactive tetrachlorosemiquinone (TCSQ*<sup>-</sup>) radical was studied using ESR and UV-Vis spectral methods. We unexpectedly found that the formation of the TCSQ*<sup>-</sup> radical was significantly inhibited and the auto-oxidation process of TCHQ by penicillamine was remarkably retarded in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, no such effects were observed by the classical copper chelating agent or by penicillamine disulfide, the oxidized form of penicillamine. ESR and HPLC-MS studies showed that the TCSQ*<sup>-</sup> radical was mainly reduced by penicillamine to TCHQ, which was simultaneously oxidized to its corresponding disulfide form. These data suggest that the protective effect of penicillamine on TCHQ-induced cytotoxicity is not due to its copper binding but rather to its effective inhibition of the formation of the TCSQ*<sup>-</sup> reactive radical through an unusual redox pathway. This is the first report showing unexpected new antioxidant activity for this copper-chelating drug, which may prove highly relevant to penicillamine's biological activities.",,"Zhu, B.

1638,Wilson's disease in France: follow-up of a cohort of 395 patients,"Background: One of the priorities of the French National Reference Center (FNRC) for Wilson's disease (WD), which received the title at the end of 2005, is to improve the epidemiological knowledge of this rare disease. The goal of the database for WD is to better define different profiles likely to cause the diagnosis and to learn more about disease development. Methods: Demographic, clinical, biological, radiological and therapeutic data of 395 patients (aged 1 to 77 years) in the two reference centers (AP-HP and Lyon) and the 6 centers of excellence (Besanon, Lille, Aix/Marseille). , Toulouse, Bordeaux and Rennes) from the FNRC for WD were collected at the time of diagnosis and/or during follow-up. Results: Diagnosis was mostly based on neurological symptoms (33%), mean age of 23 years or hepatic symptoms (34%), or with familial screening (20%). In 16% of the families, the genetic examination was inconclusive. D-penicillamine was the first line of treatment in 85% of patients and was still being prescribed in 44% of cases after 15 years of follow-up. The most common causes of death are liver failure, infections and hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion(s): As far as we know, this is the most important cohort of WM patients. However, it only covers about 1/3 of French patients. In order to improve the registration of MV patients in the database either at the time of diagnosis or during follow-up, the coordination of all healthcare professionals with a multidisciplinary approach needs to be promoted. The French registry is a major contributor to the Eurowilson database due to the number of patients enrolled and followed up.",,"Girardot-Tinant, N.;Trocello, J.

1639,Coombs negative hemolytic anemia and liver disease: A case of Wilson's disease,"Purpose: A 45-year-old black woman presented with complaints of yellowing eyes, epigastric pain, nausea/vomiting, and dark urine beginning after dilatation and curettage with hysteroscopy 3 weeks previously. She was found to have stable vital signs. Sleral jaundice and conjunctival pallor were present. She had mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound or guarding. Laboratories demonstrated leukocytosis, macrocytic anemia, coagulopathy, nonanion gap metabolic acidosis, hypophosphatemia, transaminitis with hyperbilirubinemia, and markedly low alkaline phosphatase. Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of cholelithiasis or dilatation of the common bile duct. Empirical antibiotics were administered and a transjugular liver biopsy was performed. Additional submitted labs showed a cerruloplasmin of 6.7 g/dL and confirmed negative Coomb hemolytic anemia. She was being evaluated for a liver transplant but suspended due to a possible pelvic infection. A 24-hour urine tester was sent in if Wilson's disease was suspected. However, her condition rapidly deteriorated before the diagnosis was confirmed and she was started empirically with penicillamine 250 mg po q 6 h, vitamin B6 25 mg po daily, zinc sulfate 220 mg po tid, and IV N-acetylcysteine. Pretreatment 24-hour urine copper was found to be 4056 cups. Based on her acute liver failure, markedly low alkaline phosphatase, low cerruloplasmin, negative Coomb's hemolytic anemia, elevated urinary copper and positive rubeic acid staining, the diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made. Since no pelvic infection was found, she was listed for a liver transplant. Conclusion: Wilson's disease results in copper accumulation that affects multiple organ systems including the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes. Diagnosis can be made by the presence of 2 of the following: positive family history, Kayser-Fleischer rings, Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, low total serum copper and ceruloplasmin, elevated liver copper, and elevated 24-hour urinary copper. When Wilson disease presents as acute liver failure, the goal of therapy is to induce negative copper balance by promoting urinary copper excretion and removing copper from tissues using copper chelators. Liver transplantation is indicated for acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease when medical treatment options fail.

1640,An unexpected new antioxidant-like activity for the classic copper-chelating aminothiol drug penicillamine,"Penicillamine (beta,beta'-dimethylcysteine) has been used extensively clinically as a copper-chelating aminothiol drug for the treatment of copper overload in Wilson's disease. In this study, we found that penicillamine provides significant protection in human fibroblasts against cytotoxicity induced by tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ), a major toxic metabolite of the widely used wood preservative pentachlorophenol, while other classical copper chelators such as bathocuproine disulfonate do not. The auto-oxidation process of TCHQ to give the reactive tetrachlorosemiquinone (TCSQ*-) radical was studied using ESR and UV-Vis spectral methods. We unexpectedly found that the formation of TCSQ* radicals was significantly inhibited and the TCHQ autoxidation process was remarkably retarded by penicillamine in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, no such effects were observed by the classical copper chelating agent or by penicillamine disulfide, the oxidized form of penicillamine. ESR and HPLC-MS studies showed that the TCSQ* radical was mainly reduced by penicillamine to TCHQ, which was simultaneously oxidized to its corresponding disulfide form. These data suggest that the protective effect of penicillamine on TCHQ-induced cytotoxicity was not due to its copper binding, but rather to its potent inhibition of the formation of reactive TCSQ* radicals, mainly via an unusual redox pathway instead of the well-recognized nucleophilic reaction . This is the first report showing an unexpected new antioxidant-like activity for this copper-chelating drug that may prove highly relevant to penicillamine's biological activities.",,"Zhu, B.

1641,Impaired copper homeostasis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"Purpose: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common monogenic inherited cardiac disease characterized by increased ventricular wall thickness, myocytic disorder and myocardial fibrosis. Recently, HCM has been linked to increased oxidative stress, which in turn has the potential to perpetuate hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. Myocardial copper and zinc imbalance is an important source of oxidative stress and has been shown in animal models to cause hypertrophic forms of cardiomyopathy. In addition, excess copper plays a central role in Wilson's disease, an important HCM differential diagnosis. Copper chelation, the therapy in Wilson's disease, has recently been shown to reverse LVH and organ fibrosis in several animal disease models and humans with type 2 diabetes. Surprisingly, there are no published data on copper homeostasis in patients with HCM. We examined whether patients with HCM have obvious abnormalities in copper and zinc homeostasis. METHODS: With ethical approval, we compared 20 randomly selected HCM patients from our local database with 18 matched healthy volunteers. Each participant provided 24-hour urine and fasting blood serum samples that were analyzed for copper/ceruloplasmin/zinc using the highly sensitive and widely validated technique of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results: HCM patients had significantly higher serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels (Table 1). Serum zinc tended to be higher in healthy subjects than in HCM patients. There were no significant differences in urinary zinc or copper between the two groups. (Table shown) Conclusion: HCM patients have an obviously altered copper homeostasis. Coupled with the previous observation of LVH and fibrosis regression induced by copper chelation therapy, these results provide a mechanistic basis for copper chelation therapy to be tested in HCM.",,"Potluri, R.;Roberts, N.;Miller, C.;Brooks, N.;Ray, S.;Cooper, G.;Schmitt, M.",2012,August,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehs283,0,0,
1642,Status dystonicus in Wilson's disease,"Purpose: Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions that produce torsional and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. Status dystonicus is a generalized, intense, and potentially fatal exacerbation of muscle contractures that requires urgent hospitalization. It mainly affects patients with primary or secondary dystonia and is commonly triggered by fever, infection, trauma, surgery, abrupt introduction, withdrawal, or change in medical treatment. We report a case of Wilson's disease with dystonic status. Methods: A 49-year-old man with a previous diagnosis of Wilson's disease treated with trientine and zinc sulfate presented with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. At the time of admission he had hyperthermia up to 39 ordm; C. After seizure control with diazepam and levetiracetam infusions, the patient presented with severe episodes of dystonia affecting the face, left arm and leg. Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels have been documented. The symptoms were resistant to conventional drugs. Result: Gabapentin 900 mg/day brought a clear improvement and the patient remained clinically stable. Conclusion: Although status dystonicus is a rare but serious condition, prompt diagnosis is required and gabapentin can be used to control severe episodes of dystonia.",,"Cokar, O.;Mutlu, A.;Ozer, F.

1643,A case of fulminant Wilson's disease: effect of plasmapheresis,"Background/Case Studies: Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper transport resulting in copper deposition in tissues such as the liver, kidney, brain and cornea. Rarely, patients present with fulminant Wilson's disease (fWD), in which fulminant hepatic failure, DAT-negative hemolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) lead to rapid clinical deterioration and are almost always fatal without liver transplantation. Although therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been recommended for fWD, the body of evidence is very limited as only a few case reports on the effectiveness of TPE are available. Here we report a case of fWD with successful liver transplantation after daily TPE. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: A 21-year-old woman presented with a 1-day history of dark-colored urine, jaundice, and fatigue. Physical examination and laboratory values showed liver failure, DAT-negative hemolysis, Keyser-Fleischer rings, ceruloplasmin < 4 mg/dL, AST greater than ALT (123 and 40 IU/L, respectively), and a 24-hour urinary copper level of 4703 µg . fWD was diagnosed and trientine and zinc acetate were started on day 1 of hospital admission. The patient also received 6 units of plasma for coagulopathy. From day 2, the patient received plasma volume exchange daily with plasma as a replacement fluid. Additional plasma was not required after the start of daily TPE except on day 4. Renal function began to deteriorate from day 2 and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was started on day 4 after TPE #3. The patient received daily RBC transfusions on days 1-4 (7 units total) for anemia due to intravascular hemolysis. On day 6, an orthotopic liver transplant was performed. Serum copper levels were measured from blood samples taken at admission and after the last TPE. Medical records were reviewed to assess clinical response to therapy. Results/Findings: The serum copper level at admission and after 4 consecutive daily TPE and 29 hours CRRT in addition to medication was 200 and 140 µg/dL, respectively. Hemoglobin was 7.3 g/dl on admission, 7.7-9.1 g/dl on days 2-4 with daily RBC transfusions, then 8.5-9.0 g/dl on day 5. INR remained between 2.0 and 3.5 with TPE. Histology of the explanted liver revealed cirrhosis with a very low level of stainable copper in periseptal hepatocytes and genetic analysis revealed a heterozygous mutation of ATP7B (p.Q111X). Conclusion: Hemolysis continued during treatment with TPE alone but improved with the addition of CRRT. However, TPE was an effective method of stabilizing coagulopathy without increasing blood volume. Although serum copper decreased, it remains unclear how much copper was removed by TPE compared to CRRT. Our case suggests that TPE alone is effective in stabilizing coagulopathy, but a combination of TPE with CRRT may be more efficient in stabilizing intravascular hemolysis in fWD.",,"Choi, E.

1644,Altered expression of metabolic nuclear receptor target genes in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice (Wilson disease mouse),"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the Cu-transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7b) and results in excessive hepatic copper accumulation and often leads to liver failure. The ATP7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse animal model has shown elevated hepatic copper levels similar to those in Wilson's disease patients as well as elevated nuclear copper concentrations. Previous studies showed that copper has high affinity for the estrogen receptor DNA binding domain (ER-DBD) and incubation of ER-DBD with copper results in loss of ER binding to response elements. Our hypothesis is that increased hepatic copper concentrations result in reduced activation of nuclear receptors, as zinc binding in the DNA-DBD of nuclear receptors is disrupted. In vitro translation of RXR with 4-40 muM copper (CuSO4) resulted in complete loss of FXR:RXR binding to the short heterodimer partner protein (SHP) and bile salt export pump promoters (Bsep, canalicular bile acid transporter) . addition of 40 µM zinc (ZnSO4) to the reaction restored binding to the SHP and BSEP promoters. Treatment of HepG2 cells with 5 mM CuSO 4 decreased chenodeoxycholic acid-mediated activation of BSEP mRNA expression. In Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice, Bsep and SHP mRNA expression was decreased by 40% and 40-20% at 6, 12, and 16-20 weeks, respectively, along with decreased FXR binding to the Bsep and SHP mouse promoters in the EMSA analysis. The mRNA expression of other nuclear receptor target genes was also reduced in the Ap7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 6, 12 and 16-20 weeks: HNF4a (Na<sup>+</sup>-taurocholate transporter protein , basolateral bile salt transporter, reduced by 20%, LRH-1 (Cyp8b, required for cholic acid synthesis, reduced by 40%; Abcg8, canalicular cholesterol transporter, reduced by 20%) and TR (Spot14, regulation of triglyceride pools, reduced by 40-20% HNF4a mRNA expression and RXR protein expression were unaffected in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice Basal mRNA expression of the phase I enzymes Cyp3a11 and Cyp2b10 was unchanged in Atp7b< sup>-/-</sup> mice increased 2-fold (P = 0.057), but activation with the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) agonist TCPOBOP was increased attenuated in the knockout mice (20%, Cyp3a11 and 10% Cyp2b10) compared to wild-type littermates These data indicate that the mouse model of Wilson's disease has defects in the nu clear receptor signaling that impairs the regulation of genes involved in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in the liver.",,"Wooton-Kee, C.

1645,Immunological study of a child with D-penicillamine-induced generalized myasthenia gravis,"Objective: D-penicillamine (D-Pen) is known to be a cause of drug-induced myasthenia gravis (MG), but its etiology remains unclear. Recently, a reduction in regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) has been reported in cases of non-drug-induced MG. We examined the immunological findings of a case with D-Pen-induced MG to clarify the pathogenesis of this disease. Theme: Case Report. A 12-year-old girl was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of one and was given D-Pen. She developed blepharoptosis and diurnal muscle weakness, but no bulbar palsy. Her anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChR-Ab) titer was extremely high (1520 nmol/L; normal range < 0.04 nmol/L). A Harvey-Masland test showed a decrease that was ameliorated by edrophonium administration. Therefore, she was diagnosed with D-Pen-induced generalized MG. D-Pen was discontinued and started on zinc acetate and pyridostigmine to treat her Wilson's disease and MG, respectively. Although the patient's MG symptoms had disappeared 6 months later, her unusually high anti-AChR Ab titer persisted. She was treated with immunoadsorption therapy to reduce autoantibodies, followed by administration of immunosuppressive drugs. We analyzed several immunological findings in our patient, including peripheral blood Treg counts by flow cytometry, based on the expression of CD4, CD25 and intracellular Foxp3. There was no correlation between the anti-AChR Ab titer and the patient's MG symptoms. The expression levels of their mean Treg/CD4+ lymphocytes (5.28 +/- 1.01%) were not significantly different from those of healthy controls. Conclusion: Our results support the notion that the pathogenesis of D-Pen-induced MG differs from non-drug-induced MG.",,"Nishimura, T.;Niimi, T.;Ishida, T.;Nakayama, Y.;Inaba, Y.;Naganuma, K.;Koike, K.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8749.2012.04283.x,0,0,
1646,Presentation of Wilson's disease in Pakistan: is it different from the rest of the world?,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism with an average worldwide prevalence of approximately 1 in 30,000 people. Data on WD from Pakistan are not available, so we aim to determine the pattern of WD in the Pakistani population and compare it to international literature. Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi. Results: A total of 47 patients were seen, 32 (68.1%) were male. The mean age (SD) was 26.6 (9.97) years. The most common presentation was hepatic; 22 (46.8%), neurological; 17 (36.2%) and the remaining 8 (17%) presented with psychiatric symptoms. Ceruloplasmin levels were reduced (< 0.25 g/dl) in 39 (86.6%) and serum Cu was reduced in 32 (68.1%). 24-hour urinary Cu was increased in only 22 (47.6%). Slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings was performed in 15 (31.9%) patients and only 9 (60%) had KF rings. Of these 9 patients with a positive KF ring, 8 (88.8%) had a neurological disease. The mean AST/ALT ratio was 1.92 and the median alkaline phosphatase/total bilirubin ratio was 79.30 (IQR 35.05; 166.50). 31 (65.4%) patients received a combination of D-penicillamine and zinc (Zn), 11 (23.1%) received only D-penicillamine and only 5 (11.5%) received only Zn. Only one patient with decompensated liver disease underwent liver transplantation. Conclusions: Patients with WD present slightly later in adulthood in our population, and hepatic presentation is the most common.

1647,Lesions of the cerebral cortex and white matter in Wilson's disease,"Aim: To evaluate the clinical features and imaging findings in Wilson's disease (WD) with cerebral cortex and white matter lesions. Background: The cerebral cortex and white matter eventually become involved in WM patients over the long course of the disease. Occasionally, however, the cerebral symptoms such as seizures are the initial symptoms with prominent cerebral lesions. In these cases, the diagnosis of WM is difficult and the clinical course may differ from usual cases of WM. Methods: We screened WM patients in our department from 1964 to 2011 who initially had cerebral lesions, two patients had cortical-subcortical lesions. We analyzed the clinical characteristics and courses of these patients. Results: Two of 17 WM patients in our department had cerebral lesions. Case 1: A 22-year-old man) initially presented with progressive gait disturbance, hand tremor, and psychiatric disorders. Brain MRI showed high T2-weighted white matter signal in the bilateral frontal lobes (Rt > Lt) and basal ganglia, and the cortex of the frontal lobes is gadolinium enhanced. FDG-PET showed accumulation in the cortical-subcortical lesions in the right frontal lobe, which initially led us to suspect the diagnosis of tumor. However, the possibility of WD was considered due to strong echo abnormalities in the liver. The mutation in ATB7B (c.2304insC) provided the definitive diagnosis of WD. He was treated with trienthine. However, his clinical symptoms and MR image worsened within 2 months. Therefore, zinc acetate was given second. After that, his clinical symptoms were not unchanged. Case 2: A 20-year-old man had been complaining of stuttering, hand tremors and a euphoric mood for the first 6 years. Brain CT showed areas of low density in the left frontal lobe. He was treated with D-penicillamine. After 3 months he developed a seizure and CT showed that the left frontal lesion was more extensive. Conclusions: It has previously been reported that the cerebral lesion occurs in 25% of WM patients during the clinical course. In our department, about 10% of patients initially presented with cerebral lesions. In such patients, diagnosis of WD has been difficult and chelation treatment is ineffective. We should consider the possibility of WD in patients with tremor and psychiatric disorders or even with prominent cerebral lesions involving the basal ganglia.",,"Tanaka, N.;Hanajima, R.;Terao, Y.;Goto, J.;Tsuji, S.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25051,0,0,
1648,Myeloneuropathy secondary to excessive copper removal in Wilson's disease,"Objective: case report. Background: Treatment of Wilson's disease (WD) focuses on removing excess copper from the body and preventing it from re-accumulating. Paradoxically, there have been reports of neuropathy and myeloneuropathy secondary to copper deficiency caused by excessive removal. Methods: case report. Results: The patient was a 36-year-old man with WD who was diagnosed at the age of 20 years. The main clinical picture was characterized by generalized dystonia, bradykynaesia, hiperreflexia, bilateral Babinski's sign and gait freezing. He was admitted to our unit after 6 months of deteriorating with increasing gait instability, frequent falls and numbness in his hands and feet. He presented algic hypesthesia with distribution of socks and gloves, postural and vibrational hypesthesia of the lower limbs, gait ataxia, and freezing. Neuroaxis MRI showed bilateral hiper intensity on T2 WI with no corresponding abnormal signal on T1 affecting a long segment of the posterior cord. There was no contrast enhancement on post-gadolinium images or spinal cord expansion. Lenticulocaudate copper deposits and putamen gliosis have also been observed. Electromyography showed sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. The analytical studies revealed copper in the serum 10.2 mg/dl (69.9-152.5), copper in the urine 0.64 µmol/24 h (0.78), zinc in the serum 14.7 µmol/l (12 -20), Hb 8.2 g/dl, leukocytes 10.63 x 109/l, platelets 624 x 109/l. Alternative causes of myelopathy and polyneuropathy were ruled out. A causal relationship between copper deficiency and myeloneuropathy was classified as probable. Trientine (500 mg/d) and zinc sulfate (330 mg/d) were suspended and zinc acetate 100 mg/d started. After 3 months of follow-up, a slight clinical recovery was documented. Conclusions: This case warns of the neurological consequences of excessive copper exposure during prolonged WD treatment. Myeloneuropathy symptoms may mimic the manifestations of progressive WD, with worsening postural instability and gait impairment. Awareness of the risks associated with removing excess copper coupled with more frequent monitoring of copper levels can prevent this complication.",,"Teodoro, T.;Neutel, D.;Geraldo, F.;Rosa, M.

1649,Chelation therapy-induced restless legs syndrome in Wilson's disease: a novel complication after liver transplantation,"Aim: To describe a novel side effect of copper chelation therapy in a patient with Wilson's disease after liver transplantation. Background: A 52-year-old man with genetically confirmed Wilson's disease was started on D-penicillamine therapy as a teenager. He tolerates copper chelation well, but develops decompensated liver disease and requires a transplant. After liver transplantation, chelation therapy was discontinued. Ten months post-transplant, he presented with progressive dysarthria, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity. D-penicillamine therapy was resumed. METHODS: Serial biochemical results from several hospitals visited by the patient were compiled. The stoichiometry of penicillamine transition metal reactions and the dissociation constants of these reactions were checked. Results: After liver transplantation, the biochemical abnormalities associated with Wilson's disease normalize. However, neuropsychiatric symptoms have a variable outcome. In this case, chelation was resumed due to progressive neurological symptoms, but in a patient with essentially normal copper biochemistry. Copper is excreted preferentially by D-penicillamine in Wilson's disease since these patients are copper burdened. As the copper mass decreases, other transition metals with a lower affinity constant but in relatively greater abundance than copper are precipitated. Iron deficiency developed in this patient upon resumption of D-penicillamine treatment, resulting in disabling Restless Legs Syndrome. Conclusions: The use of chelating agents in Wilson's patients after liver transplantation can lead to transition metal deficiencies. This occurs when copper levels normalize and the dissociation constant for the reaction is invariant. This is the first report of penicillamine-induced restless legs syndrome in a patient with Wilson's disease.",,"O'Brien, M.;Counihan, T.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25051,0,0,
1650,Epilepsy in Wilson's disease (WD),"Aim: To evaluate patients with WM with epilepsy. Background: WM is an autosomal recessive inherited, treatable copper accumulation and copper toxicity with protean manifestations primarily affecting the brain and liver. Neurologically, it manifests as a movement disorder with speech disorders, tremors, incoordination, and dystonia as common features. Epilepsy is not a common presentation of WD. Methods: We studied 31 patients with WM and found that 6 of them had epilepsy. These patients were examined in addition to detailed medical history, general and neurological examination, slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer ring in the cornea, routine biochemical and copper tests (serum ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urine copper and serum copper) and neuroimaging Electroencephalogram (EEG) underwent. Results: Of the 6 (19.4%) patients with epilepsy, 4 (66.7%) were male and the rest were female. 4 (66.7%) of the patients were in the adolescent (<= 18 years) group, while the other 2 (33.3%) were in the adult (>= 18 years) group. The 4 adolescent patients showed predominant dystonic features and the 2 adult patients had both neurological and psychiatric features. 4 (66.7%) patients had complex partial seizures with secondary generalization, while 2 (33.3%) had generalized seizures. 1 (16.7%) patient also had occasional myoclonic jerks. The EEG was abnormal in all 6 patients with theta background and observed focal and generalized discharges. In 4 (66.7%) patients, seizures began before the start of decoppering therapy, while in 2 patients they began later. All patients responded well to antiepileptic drugs. The response of WD itself to treatment was more variable, with 2 (33.3%) patients improving, 3 (50%) patients initially deteriorating with mild improvement, and 1 (16.7%) patient deteriorating and dying . Conclusions: The prevalence of epilepsy in our study is 19.4%. It is about 30 times higher than the prevalence of epilepsy in the general population and therefore probably does not represent an accidental association. It may be due to either direct copper toxicity (probably through membrane ATPase inhibition) or to pyridoxine deficiency during the use of penicillamine or due to a metabolic encephalopathy-like condition. Although the prognosis of epilepsy in WM is comparable to that in the general population, to what extent it affects the prognosis of WM, a larger series of such patients needs to be investigated.",,"Kumar, N.;Joshi, D.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25051,0,1,
1651,Spectrum of movement disorders in Wilson's disease and their response to penicillamine therapy,"Aim: To present the spectrum of movement disorders in Wilson's disease (WD) and the predictors of response to penicillamine therapy. Background: While movement disorders are a dominant feature in neurological WD, there are few studies on their spectrum and response to penicillamine. Methods: Consecutive neurological WM patients underwent a detailed medical history and clinical examination. The type, extent and severity of the movement disorders were recorded. Complete blood count, serum chemistry, ceruloplasmin, copper, urine copper, abdominal ultrasound, and skull MRI were performed. Severity of WD, rated on a scale of 0-3. After penicillamine, patients were followed up at 3 months and considered worsened if there was >1 grade worsening. Results: 67 patients with neurological WM were included, mean age was 13 (4-41) years, and 14 were women. 63 patients had movement disorders; Dystonia in 17, tremor in 2 and the remainder had dystonia associated with tremor in 21, myoclonus in 7, choreoathetosis in 11 and chorea and tremor in 5 patients. MRI was abnormal in 79%; 87% had corpus striatum involvement, and 56% each had brainstem, thalamus, and globus pallidus involvement. After 3 months of treatment, 22 (32.8%) patients had worsening neurological status and family history of WM (p=0.03), low white blood cell count (p=0.03), chronic liver disease (CLD) on ultrasound ( p=0.008). Out Of 38 patients with CLD, 19 (86.4%) patients had worsening, while 90% (26/29) patients without CLD had no worsening. Disease duration (p=0.47), movement disorder severity (p=90), serum creatinine (p=0.97), albumin (p=0.87), bilirubin (p=0.40), transaminase (p=0 .78), copper (p=0.93), urinary copper (p=0.70), and number of MRI lesions (p=0.60) were unrelated to deterioration. Urinary copper excretion at 3 months compared to baseline was significantly higher in the deteriorating group than in the no-deteriorating group (mean 53.3 Vs -3.2, p=0.005).

1652,Speech behavior in Wilson's disease,"Aim: This study analyzed the language behavior of Wilson's disease patients. Background: Wilson disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive disease and is characterized by copper deposits mainly in the liver and central nervous system. Speech problems can occur in the neurological manifestations of Wilson's disease, but these are poorly known and described, which makes it difficult to devise efficient intervention procedures. METHODS: Thirty patients diagnosed and treated at the Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, 16 males and 14 females, between the ages of 19 and 58, are all on medical treatment (D -penicillamine or zinc sulfate) in variable doses. They were also subjected to a phonoaudiological assessment consisting of a perceptual-auditory qualified analysis of speech behavior. Results: The analysis showed 7 (seven) patients (23.2%) without speech disorders, 9 patients (30%) with anarthria and 14 patients (46.67%) with dysarthria. In this last group 1 patient (3.33%) with low level, 8 patients (26.66%) with moderate level and 5 patients (16.66%) with accentuated level. Conclusions: These results suggest that there is no standard in disease manifestation and that clinical language expression is variable. Therefore, systematic studies that correlate clinical signs and symptoms with functional tests and laboratory and imaging studies are needed to improve the understanding of the different clinical forms, treatment and rehabilitation of Wilson's disease.",,"Estevo, A.

1653,Smell analysis in Wilson's disease,"Objective: Smell analysis in patients with Wilson's disease. Background: Wilson's disease, described by Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson in 1912, is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Affected people have excessive accumulation of copper in the liver, which, if left undetected, can be fatal due to improper copper excretion in the bile. Methods: The Sniffin' Sticks test (16 sticks) was used for odor evaluation. The study analyzed 60 controls (24 women and 36 men, mean age 33.81 years) and 64 patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease (29 women and 35 men, mean age 31.28 years). All patients with Wilson's disease are on medical treatment (trientine, D-penicillamine, or zinc sulfate), 26 patients (13 females and 13 males) have hepatic manifestation only, and 38 patients (16 females and 22 males) have both hepatic and neurological manifestations . Right Fisher and Mann-Whitney tests were used in statistical analysis. Results: Wilson's disease patients with only hepatic manifestation and patients with neurological manifestations are statistically similar, but there are differences for five variants (mint, banana, lemon, aniseed, and fish) and for the variable Sniffin' Sticks Total between Wilson's disease patients and the control group. Conclusions: Our study showed the difference between patients with Wilson's disease and the control group in identifying specific odors (mint, banana, lemon, anise and fish).",,"Carvalho, M.

1654,Wilson's disease: Follow-up studies in a cohort of 135 Neuro-Wilson patients spanning more than a decade,"Aim: To characterize the symptoms of patients with Wilson's disease (WD) and the response to treatment. Background: WM is an inherited metabolic disorder that mainly causes neuropsychiatric and hepatic dysfunction. Left untreated, it causes severe morbidity and death. Long-term clinical follow-up data are limited in the literature. METHODS: 135 consecutive patients diagnosed with neuro-WD in the movement disorder clinic of a tertiary care center in India (Bangur Institute of Neurology) were included. The study period was from June 1996 to December 2011. This is both a retrospective (28) and a prospective study (107). The diagnosis of WD was made using Sternlieb's criteria. The KF ring was positive overall, the data were compiled in semi-structured form. Treatment was with D-penicillamine and zinc salts. Other medications were also given as needed. The patients were followed up at regular intervals. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 11.79 years; (males: females 584:51). The mean disease duration before diagnosis was 15.30 months. Family history of WD was present in 22.96%; Consanguinity in 10.37%. A history of jaundice was present in 47.41%; Liver disease in 44.44%. Presenting features were: dysarthria - 90.44%, parkinsonism - 81.62%, dystonia - 90.4%, tremor - 51.11%, choreoathetosis - 11.85%, ataxia - 11.76%, sialorrhea - 77, 21%, dysphagia - 55.88%, seizures - 17.16%, psychiatric - 62.31%; Arthralgia/arthritis - 3.7%, myopathy - 7.5%, amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea - 7.5%, darkening of the skin - 11.6%, bleeding disorders - 7%. The mean improvement time was 7.11 months. 14.58% of patients initially deteriorated on D-penicillamine, which did not recur when the drug was resumed at lower doses. Dysarthria and residual dystonia were the most common residual deficits (86% and 90.4%, respectively). Behavioral problems often worsened even as physical symptoms improved. The KF ring disappeared in 7.40% and the urinary copper level normalized in 11.11%. 33.33% of the patients were at least once a drug culprit. 7.407% became free of symptoms; 15.55% had residual symptoms but were meaningfully employed; 25.92% - had symptoms but could do ADL; 24.44% - partially dependent; and 16.30% - severely dependent. Mortality was 10.37%. Conclusions: Dystonia and dysarthria were the most common features. Early treatment leads to better results. The treatment must be individual. Drug offenders quickly deteriorated.",,"Bagchi, M.;Das, S. K.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25051,0,1,
1655,Patients with free copper toxicosis in Wilson's disease should be treated with zinc from the start,"Objective: Make known that (1) Wilson's disease (WD) is not an appropriate name for a treatable free copper toxicosis (2) zinc is an appropriate choice for the treatment of copper toxicosis. Background: Patients with WM have been abusively treated with chelating agents aimed at excreting the accumulated copper. It took 50 years before it was widely accepted that chelating agents are unscientific and irrational. On the contrary, zinc reduces copper absorption in the intestines, which leads to a reduction in copper poisoning. In principle, it is impossible to carry out comparative clinical studies for a rare disease. Consequently, lessons should be learned from case reports and tested theories based on expert judgement. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational best available method study in three cases of free copper intoxication in WD treated with zinc monotherapy: (1) a 12-year-old boy with hypokinesia, dysarthria, tremor, dystonia, and involuntary movements, (2) a 24-year-old girl with progressive tremor, gait disturbances, and torticollis; and (3) a critically ill 10-year-old girl who presented suddenly with hemolytic anemia indicated for liver transplantation. Although the second patient, originally presented with decompensated hepatitis, had been treated with penicillamine for approximately 15 years, he newly deteriorated with neurological symptoms. The clinical situation and biochemical parameters such as urine copper and liver function tests as well as the physical examination were frequently evaluated. Results: The first patient with neurological and degenerative symptoms improved biochemically in a few months and also clinically significantly in about 12 months under 150 mg zinc. The second patient's symptoms particularly disappeared in about a month on 100 mg of zinc. The most striking finding was in the third patient, who required urgent liver transplantation and was dropped from the list on just 2 weeks of zinc monotherapy 125 mg with impressive clinical improvement. All became symptom free. Conclusions: The goal in treating WM should be prevention of free copper poisoning. Zinc has been the treatment of choice for the management of free copper intoxication in MM from the outset",,"Avan, A.;Azarpazhooh, M.;Kianifar, H.;Hoogenraad, T.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25051,0,0,
1656,Elastosis perforans serpiginosa with atypical and widespread appearance,"Introduction and Goals. Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is a rare skin disorder characterized by transepithelial elimination of connective tissue elements such as elastic fibers from the papillary dermis. There are three different types of this disease: idiopathic, reactive, and drug-induced. The reactive forms are associated with other diseases such as Down syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, scleroderma and pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The drug-induced form is seen in about 1% of patients treated with D-penicillamine. This drug is used for diseases such as Wilson's disease and homocystinuria. The most common clinical presentation is small keratotic papules, usually affecting the face, neck, trunk and upper limbs. Topical retinoids, corticoids, calcineurin inhibitors, and various types of lasers have been used to treat this disease with varying response rates. (Representation shown) We report the case of a 16-year-old boy with Down syndrome who presented with an atypical and widespread case of serpiginous elastosis perforans. report of the case. A 16-year-old boy with Down's syndrome was referred to our department presenting with large plaques on the anterior aspect of both thighs. The plaques were erythematous with a depressed center and raised hyperkeratosic margins. No other skin lesions were observed. A skin biopsy from one of the margins was performed, showing acanthosis and transepithelial elimination of elastic fibers, which stained positively with orcein. These histological features were consistent with the diagnosis of elastosis perforans serpiginosa. The patient was treated with topical betamethasone and calcipotriol without a good response. Conclusions. We report a case of elastosis perforans serpiginosa in a 16-year-old boy with Down syndrome. EPS usually affects children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 20, and lesions are located on the face, neck, and arms. The clinical presentation in this child was widespread and atypical, with large erythematous plaques affecting the anterior aspect of both thighs, with no other lesions on the face or arms. The incidence of EPS in patients with Down syndrome is higher than in the general population. A possible explanation for this could be that patients with Down syndrome have changes in the connective tissue and elastic fibers, such as premature skin aging and post-folliculitis anetoderma.

1657,Successful pregnancy outcome in a woman with Wilson's disease complicated by liver cirrhosis: A case report,"Aim: To report a successful pregnancy outcome in a woman with Wilson's disease treated in a UK District General Hospital. A literature review is presented with the case. METHODS: Prospective follow-up of Index-Fallin during pregnancy, delivery and the postpartum period. A retrospective review of the current evidence was performed using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Results: A 28-year-old firstborn with Wilson's disease, diagnosed in her late teens, was presented at 14 weeks gestation. She suffered from cirrhosis of the liver. Preconception, her disease was stable on zinc therapy, necessitating a switch to trientine at 20 weeks' gestation due to her iron deficiency, partly due to zinc therapy. A tight multidisciplinary approach involving obstetricians, hematologists and hepatologists was implemented. Her pregnancy was initially complicated by several episodes of self-terminating nosebleeds, which settled down by the third trimester. She had induction of labor for suspected obstetric cholestasis at 38 weeks gestation and gave birth to a healthy male weighing 3014 g. Delivery was complicated by a major postpartum hemorrhage of 1500ml which was successfully treated. She recovered to her stable condition before pregnancy. Conclusions: This case serves to highlight the importance of appropriately applying a multidisciplinary team approach and utilizing limited resources in the management of a challenging medical disorder in pregnancy. It illustrates the difficulty of treatment during pregnancy and the fine line between overtreatment and undertreatment. Wilson disease is a rare condition with limited evidence to support treatment decisions.",,"Ryan, L.;Kapoor, T.;Muslim, I.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0528.2012.03376.x,0,0,
1658,Children with Wilson's disease: findings of proton magnetic spectroscopy,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Neurological involvement is less common in pediatric patients with Wilson disease (WD) than in adults. Therefore, subclinical neurological involvement cannot be ruled out. Brain spectroscopy (MRS) has been used as a tool to provide clinically useful metabolic information about the neurological deterioration of WD. The aim of our study was to determine the brain metabolic changes due to WD through the use of MRS in patients with mild liver disease treated since childhood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients (15 males) with a definite diagnosis of WM (mean age at diagnosis 6.6 years; range 1.8-14.4) were included. The diagnosis of WD was made when at least two of the following were present: ceruloplasmin levels < 20 mg/dL, basal urinary copper levels > 100 µg/24 hours, urinary copper levels by penicillamine challenge > 1575 µg/24 hours, liver copper levels > 250 mcg/g dry weight. All patients had mild liver disease at baseline with subtle neurological signs in 8 cases (36.4%). All 22 patients were examined with MRS in the basal ganglia (BG), occipital cortex (POC) and frontal white matter (FWM). The ratio of the following metabolites was calculated in terms of creatine (Cr): N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and myoinositol (mL). The mean peak linewidth was measured for each spectrum. At the time of MRS assessment, mean disease duration was 13.7 years (range 2.1-24.1) and mean age was 19.6 years (range 9.8-34.4). Results: The metabolic conditions in MRS in our cohort were found to be within the normal range. Compared to the group of patients with liver symptoms, the group with concomitant subtle neurological symptoms did not have a significantly decreased NAA/Cr ratio (GB: 82.7% versus 89.6%; POC: 101.2% versus 116.6%; FWM : 89.1% versus 86.2%). and elevated mI/Cr ratio (GB: 26.9% versus 22.7%; POC: 34.8% versus 34.9%; FWM: 46.4% versus 42.9%) in the three areas examined. Conclusions: It is known that in adult MV patients with neurological symptoms, MRS changes are clearly associated with a decrease in NAA/Cr ratio, which is associated with neuronal loss, and an increased mI/Cr ratio, associated with gliosis and inflammation related. The lack of reduced NAA/Cr levels and elevated mI/Cr levels in our cohort seems to indicate that early therapy can prevent neuronal loss, gliosis, and inflammation in brain areas, even in children with subtle neurological signs at onset.",,"Ranucci, G.;Liccardo, D.;Puoti, G.;Di Dato, F.;Tufano, M.;Venturino, D.;Iorio, R.",2012,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1590-8658%2812%2960532-5,0,0,
1659,Pancreatic involvement in children with Wilson's disease on long-term zinc therapy,"Background and Aim: Wilson's disease (WD) is a disease characterized by accumulation of copper in various organs, particularly the liver. The treatment is based on the use of copper chelators and zinc. In adult WM patients treated with zinc, frequent increases in serum amylase and lipase without symptoms of pancreatitis have been reported. The aim of our study was to evaluate pancreatic enzymes in WM children on long-term zinc therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 43 WM patients (28 males; mean age at diagnosis 6.1 years, range 1.1-20.9) were retrospectively studied. The patients were symptom-free. Diagnosis of WD was made in the presence of at least two of the following features: ceruloplasmin levels < 20 mg/dL, basal urinary copper (UCu) > 100 mcg/24 hours, UCu by penicillamine challenge test > 1575 mcg/24 hours, copper levels in the liver >250 mcg/g dry weight. Thirty-two patients (24 males) on long-term treatment (mean duration 12 years, range 3-25) with zinc (25 or 50 mg elemental zinc 2 or 3 times daily depending on body weight and age) were studied. Adherence to therapy was assessed on the basis of clinical history and serum and urine copper and zinc levels. Amylase and lipase serum levels were analyzed in all patients over the course of zinc therapy. Results: Twenty-seven patients (84%) maintained normal ALT levels on zinc therapy. According to UCu excretion (37+/-2 mcg/24 h) at the end of follow-up, all patients had good adherence to therapy. Serum pancreatic levels were normal in all before starting zinc therapy. Nine patients (28%) showed hyperamylasemia (219 +/- 44 UI/l) and 7 (22%) hyperlipasemia (110 +/- 30 UI/l) under zinc therapy, without clinical and radiological signs of pancreatitis. Only one 24-year-old adolescent (3%) had an attack of acute symptomatic pancreatitis with high levels of amylase and lipase (300 UI/L and 220 UI/L, respectively) after 78 months of zinc therapy. Common causes of pancreatitis other than zinc were excluded. Conclusions: This study confirms that most WM patients who are chronically treated with zinc also have benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia in childhood. Contrary to previous reports, acute pancreatitis can occur.",,"Ranucci, G.;Tufano, M.;Liccardo, D.;Di Dato, F.;Puoti, G.;Salvatori, M.;Iorio, R.",2012,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1590-8658%2812%2960410-1,0,0,
1660,Long-term zinc therapy in children with mild liver disease,"Background and aim: Wilson's disease (WD) is a disorder of copper metabolism. In pediatric age, most cases have a hepatic presentation. It is generally accepted that penicillamine is the first-line therapy for children with liver disease, while zinc is indicated in pre-symptomatic patients and as maintenance therapy. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of zinc-only monotherapy in WM children with isolated hypertransaminasemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All MV patients referred to our children's hospital for diagnostic testing of elevated serum aminotransferases were analyzed. Diagnosis of WM was made in the presence of at least two of the following: low ceruloplasmin (< 20 mg/dL), increased basal urinary copper (> 100 mcg/24 hours), increased urinary copper following penicillamine Challenge test (PCT; >1575 µg/24 hours), an elevated liver copper level (>250 µg/g dry weight). Of the 43 WM patients enrolled, 29 were treated with zinc for a median of 12 years (range 3-25). Zinc was the initial treatment of choice in 12 cases. Normalization of serum ALT was the main parameter of treatment efficacy in this study. Adherence to therapy was assessed on the basis of clinical history and serum and urine copper and zinc levels. Results: Among 17 (58%) children treated with first-line penicillamine, 4 (24%) normalized ALT within a median of 14 months (range 4 to 48) and commenced maintenance zinc therapy. The remaining 13 (76%) patients with sustained hyper-ALT while on penicillamine crossed over to zinc; nine of these (70%) normalized ALT to zinc within a median of 9.5 months (range 5 to 151). Eleven (92%) of the 12 patients who received zinc alone as first choice normalized ALT within a median of 14 months (range: 2 to 46). The patient with persistent hyper-ALT on zinc showed poor adherence to therapy. According to the 24-hour urinary copper excretion (56+4 versus 37+2 mcg) at the end of follow-up, the efficacy in terms of decoppering was comparable in the two groups. Conclusions: Although penicillamine therapy is commonly used for the initial treatment of Wilson's disease, the present study demonstrated that zinc monotherapy can be used as first-line therapy in WM children with isolated hypertransaminasemia at presentation.",,"Ranucci, G.;Di Dato, F.;Puoti, G.;Liccardo, D.;Tufano, M.;Iorio, R.",2012,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1590-8658%2812%2960278-3,0,1,
1661,Concomitant immune-mediated phenomenon in Wilson's disease: implication for monitoring chelator therapy,"Introduction: Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic copper storage disorder that leads to liver failure and neurological deterioration. Current guidelines favor the use of chelating agents (dpenicillamine, trientine) in the first-line therapy of symptomatic patients. The development of chelator-induced immunological adverse events leading to impaired renal function or bone marrow depression is a problem, particularly with D-pencillamine therapy. Based on some case reports, a predictive value for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in this context has been proposed. Aim: The aim of the current study was to assess the prevalence of coexisting or treatment-associated immune-mediated disease in WM patients in a retrospective cohort study and to evaluate the role of antinuclear antibodies in therapy monitoring. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 222 MM patients were retrospectively analyzed in a European maximum care center. The medical therapies were classified and analyzed for adverse events and the course of antinuclear antibodies. Results: Hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms occurred in 153/222 (69.0%) and 71/222 (32.0%) patients, respectively. Confirmed coexisting immune-mediated diseases were evident in 28/222 (12.6%) patients. Data on the course of ANA treatment and meaningful data on side effects were available for 91 treatments with D-penicillamine, 58 treatments with trientine and 58 treatments with zinc salts. Within these treatments, 16/91 (17.6%) patients in the D-penicillamine group, 12/58 (20.7%) patients in the trientine group, and 7/58 (12.1 %) of patients an increase in ANA titers observed the zinc group (p=ns). Analysis of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation showed no correlation with a prior increase in ANA titers in any group. Conclusion: In our cohort, an increase in ANA was a common finding, but it was unrelated to the clinical picture and independent of the medical regimen used. We observed no correlation between an increase in ANA and the development of associated immune-mediated adverse events in any treatment groups and particularly in the d-penicillamine group. Therefore, the value of this parameter for monitoring adverse events seems to be significantly limited.",,"Seesle, J.;Gotthardt, D. N.;Merle, U.;Gohdes, A.;Pfeiffenberger, J.;Stremmel, W.;Weiss, K.

1662,Blisters from my surgery: medical history supported by internet images,"84-year-old WF admitted to subacute rehab. to recover from complications after total knee arthroplasty. PMHx. consists of DM, HTN, anemia, HLD, CAD, COPD, CKD, anxiety and hypothyroidism. After two weeks of successful rehabilitation, she developed blisters on her extremities and upper body with no other symptoms. When the blisters burst, they push out a clear liquid, then crusts and new blisters appear elsewhere on their body. The patient was started on prednisone in the hospital, but no documentation was found on the reason for this. Upon further questioning, she stated that she had had the blisters before and that steroids usually improved them. With no documentation found about her bladders until then, COPD exacerbations were the putative cause of her steroid treatments. After verifying and considering that the patient is a woman over 60, with previous episodes of uncomplicated blistering, also that these blisters have responded to treatment with steroids, and finally and importantly after comparing her lesions to those found online multiple times Locations Our patient was diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid and started long prednisone cone therapy after which she improved and was successfully discharged home. Discussion: Bullous pemphigoid is a fairly rare disease, but if it usually occurs in older women, it is a differential diagnosis that we should consider when bullous is present in the elderly, followed by pemphigus (similar but less common bladder disease). The difference between the two is autoantibodies against intradermal epitopes in the latter versus subdermal autoantibodies in the former. Both have been associated with a higher risk of death and therefore primary care geriatricians and those caring for the elderly should be vigilant to diagnose and treat bullous pemphigoid, treatment consists primarily of wound care (treating like a burn ) and oral steroids. Recurrences are common and even longer courses of steroids may be required. The etiology is not well understood, but an autoimmune reaction is known. The diagnosis is clinical. A connection with some drugs is known (Furosemide, Penicillamine and Captopril - among the best known).",,"Garrido, A.

1663,"Copper-deficiency myeloneuropathy with hypozincemia due to zinc excess, gastrectomy, and low serum ceruloplasmin","Aim: We describe low serum zinc levels in copper-deficiency myeloneuropathy (CuDM) associated with excessive zinc intake and prior gastrectomy. Background Copper malabsorption occurs after gastrectomy or bariatric surgery and can cause CuDM. The antagonistic relationship between copper and zinc is the basis for treating copper excess conditions (e.g. Wilson's disease) with zinc supplementation. Excess zinc due to long-term use of denture cream can be the cause of CuDM. DESIGN/METHODS: Case report: An 83-year-old man developed progressive triple flexor spasms, severe sensory loss, and absent/decreased reflexes with Babinski's signs over 5 years after gastrectomy 38 years ago while using zinc-based denture cream (three tubes weekly). . for 30 years and with hypoceruloplasminemia. Serum copper was 0.12 µg/mL (RI 0.75-1.45 µg/mL), ceruloplasmin 4.0 mg/dL (RI 15-30 mg/dL), and serum zinc 0.58 µg/mL (RI 0, 66-1.0 µg/mL). Results: Our patient had three causes of CuDM hypocuremia, zinc excess intake, and hypoceruloplasminemia. Patients with CuDM due to excessive zinc intake may have normal to elevated serum zinc levels (Nations 2008). Hypozincemia was described by Kumar et al. (Kumar 2004) in a post-gastrectomy patient with poor copper absorption. A gastrectomy, in addition to reducing serum copper levels, will also reduce serum zinc. Our patient presented with low serum zinc levels due to excessive zinc intake, which was probably the result of his previous gastrectomy. Conclusions: Excessive intake of zinc interferes with copper uptake and can lead to CuDM. Our patient with CuDM associated with a previous gastrectomy, excessive zinc intake, and hypoceruloplasminemia had low serum zinc. This likely reflected reduced zinc absorption due to his previous gastrectomy. Low serum zinc does not rule out CuDM.",,"Josiah, A.;Salomon, A.;Tacker, D.;Gutmann, L.",2012,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WNL.78.1,0,0,
1664,Certain problems and our suggestions for the pharmaceutical treatment of Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excess accumulation of copper in the body. It is a very rare condition in the Caucasian population but appears to be more common in Chinese. Here we have summarized our experience in the pharmacological treatment of the disease: (1) We select different first-line drugs for patients with different presentations. In general, we choose penicillamine for patients with mainly hepatic symptoms. Penicillamine should be avoided or used with great caution in patients with significant stiffness, drooling, dysarthria and dysphagia. (2) Treatment of WM should be started as early as possible. Zinc supplements alone may be sufficient for asymptomatic WD children with only abnormal liver function tests. Penicillamine should be added as soon as they become symptomatic or have an abnormal liver sonogram. (3) Copper level in 24-hour urine is a good reference for drug dose adjustment. A target of 200-500ug 24 UCC is usually indicative of a good dosage of chelating agents. (4) lifelong treatment with good compliance should be emphasized. (5) Zinc can be used during pregnancy. If necessary, a small dose of penicillamine (250 mg/day) can be added. (6) Chinese herbal medicines should be carefully selected and used as an adjunctive treatment.",,"Liang, X. L.;Li, X.

Hepatic and neurological symptoms are the main clinical features of the disease. Aim: The aim of the study is to analyze the clinical presentation, epidemiological features, disease course and response to therapy in a historical cohort of 36 Brazilian WM patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 36 patients with WM diagnosed from 1971 to 2010 and followed in southern Brazil were studied. Diagnosis of WM was based on clinical presentation, family history, Kayser-Fleischer rings, low serum cerulosplasmin, increased 24-hour urinary copper excretion, liver biopsy, genetic testing, and/or response to a D-penicillamine challenge test. Results: There were 16 (44.4%) male and 20 female (56.6%) patients with a mean age of 34.6 +/- 10.8 years, with a high predominance of exclusively European continental origin (74.5%) . The mean age at the first symptom presentation was 23.2 +/- 9.3 years. The time from first clinical symptom and final diagnosis was 27.5 +/- 41.9 months. At presentation, 9 patients (25%) had neuropsychiatric symptoms only, 14 (38.9%) had hepatic symptoms only, 11 (30.6%) had both hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms (mixed presentation), and 2 (5.5%) ) were asymptomatic.

1666,An overview of biochemical genetics,"Biochemical genetics focuses on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of inherited metabolic disorders. Although rare individually, the combined incidence of these diseases is likely to be over 1 in 3000 live births. These conditions may present in the neonatal period as an acute, life-threatening illness or may manifest later in childhood with symptoms of progressive neurodegeneration, skeletal abnormalities, and/or dysmorphism. The aim of this introductory unit is to provide an overview of the different clinical categories of metabolic diseases, modern diagnostic methods and treatment options. © 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",,"Sharer, J.

1667,Clear clinical courses according to the present phenotypes and their correlations to ATP7B mutations in a large Wilson disease cohort,"Large phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneities in Wilson disease (WD) have been reported, hampering the study of their correlations. The aim of this study was to identify the factors related to these differences. Methods: Clinical courses and molecular genetic traits were analyzed in 237 unrelated Korean MM families. The mean follow-up time was 8.2 +/- 5.8 years. Results: The present phenotypes were classified as H1 (12.2%), H2 (42.4%), N1 (21.6%), N2 (0.4%), NX (0.4%), presymptomatic (22 .4%) and others (0.4%), modifying the classifications of Ferenci and colleagues. In the presymptomatic group, age at presentation was youngest and cirrhosis least common. Decompensated cirrhosis was highest in the H1 group. A favorable outcome was least common in the N1 group. Forty-seven (11 new) ATP7B mutations were identified in 85% of the 474 alleles. Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification assays in ATP7B and analyzes of the ATOX1 and COMMD1 genes did not identify any additional mutations. Yeast complementation assays revealed a functional disruption of the seven new missense mutants. Five major mutations, p.Arg778Leu, p.Ala874Val, p.Asn1270Ser, p.Lys838SerfsX35 and p.Leu1083Phe accounted for 63% of the alleles. H1 was more common, age at presentation was younger, and N1+N2+NX tended to be less common in patients with nonsense, frame-shifting, or splicing mutations than in patients with missense mutations alone. Patients with both mutations in the transduction (Td) or ATP joint domain showed presymptomatic or hepatic manifestations, but no neurological manifestations. Conclusions: The present phenotype strongly affects the clinical outcome of WM and is related to the type and location of the ATP7B mutation, providing evidence for genotype-phenotype correlations in WM. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",,"Lee, B.

1668,An introduction to Wilson's disease for the general practitioner. [French],"Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of hepatic copper excretion that leads to toxic accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, cornea, and other organs. The defect is due to mutations in the copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B. Clinical manifestations are highly variable and include acute liver failure, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, and neurological or psychiatric symptoms. The Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring is pathognomonic, but is absent in about 50% of patients with only hepatic manifestations. A high index of suspicion in clinically compatible situations is key, with a combination of laboratory tests enabling the diagnosis of WM. Treatment is based on the use of chelating agents, D-penicillamine or trientine. Liver transplantation should be considered in patients with acute liver failure or advanced cirrhosis.",,"Hiroz, P.;Antonino, A.;Doerig, C.;Pache, I.;Moradpour, D.",2011,2022-09-07 00:00:00,,0,0,
1669,Levels of serum copper and serum-free copper in the diagnosis and surveillance of Wilson's disease and its carriers. [Chinese],"Aim: To study the levels of serum copper and serum-free copper in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD), its carrier and viral hepatitis, and to investigate the guiding importance of monitoring serum copper in the management of WD. Methods: A total of 80 WM patients (liver type, n=60; encephalic type, n=20), 30 carriers, 20 patients with viral hepatitis were enrolled and their serum copper levels were determined. Neural symptoms were scored using modified Young's grade. Blood counts, liver functions, blood coagulation functions, serum copper and urine copper were tested during all 8 courses of sodium dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS) treatment. Patients were treated with zinc after discharge. All data were analyzed. Results: Serum free copper increased in patients with WD (0.17 mg/L +/- 0.04 mg/L), carriers (0.13 mg/L +/- 0.03 mg/L), and severe viral hepatitis ( 0.12mg/L) . A slight increase was also observed among WD wearers. Serum copper levels correlated with liver function but not with the severity of neural symptoms. Serum copper increased in patients without improvement in neural symptoms. However, serum copper in WM patients decreased as neural symptoms improved. Serum copper was stabilized at approximately 0.2 mg/L during the long-term treatment period. Conclusion: There is an additional diagnostic importance of serum copper in determining WD. Liver functions in liver type WD influence the serum copper level. The serum copper of the encephalic type WD cannot indicate the severity of the neural symptoms. Elevated serum copper levels indicate a poor prognosis. Serum copper is an effective marker in monitoring disease development and therapeutic efficacy.

1670,Ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. The long road to diagnosis. [German],"We report the case of a 13-year-old boy who was symptom-free but had elevated transaminases and gamma-GT on routine blood work. The extremely elevated hepatic copper concentration led to the diagnosis of Wilson's disease; therapy with D-penicillamine was initiated. A few weeks later, the boy presented with weight loss and signs of colitis and pancreatitis. Discontinuation of therapy resulted in improvement of colitis. After recurrence of symptoms during rechallenge, penicillamine therapy was discontinued due to suspected drug-induced colitis and pancreatitis. With alternative zinc therapy, liver enzymes rose again, accompanied by an increase in autoantibodies and persistently high fecal lactoferrin. Subsequent reassessment led to the definitive diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and ulcerative colitis. The above case shows the diagnostic difficulties of elevated transaminases without specific clinical symptoms. Despite the high specificity of the liver copper content for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, cholestatic liver diseases must be ruled out, as they can lead to pronounced secondary hepatic copper storage. Based on the reported case, the characteristics of ulcerative colitis and PSC are presented, in particular their association, diagnosis and therapy.",,"Tesch, N.;Lange, L.;Vorndamme, I.;Buderus, S.",2011,December,,0,0,
1671,Musculoskeletal Disorders Associated with Wilson's Disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is a rare disease defined as an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by release of free copper and dramatic accumulation of intracellular copper in the liver with subsequent liver and central nervous system abnormalities. Mutations in the ATP7B gene are responsible for the metabolic disorder. Small open studies have reported radiological abnormalities of the spine including scoliosis, diffuse bone demineralization, osteochondritis and occasionally fracture. The prevalence of osteoporosis in young adult patients is debated and ranges from 10% with normal mean Z-score values to 43% in adults. Up to 50% of patients may have a history of spinal or peripheral fractures. Joint diseases include arthralgias of large joints, such as knee pain, infrequent effusions, early onset of radiological features of osteoarthritis and associated osteochondritis of the knee joint. Radiological chondrocalcinosis, an uncommon feature in young adults, needs to be confirmed. Few patients may develop drug-induced lupus with arthralgias, positive anti-nucleus and anti-histone antibodies, secondary to D-penicillamine, the main copper chelator used in WD. In this rare disease, small retrospective studies fail to identify clear MV-related joint and bone manifestations. However, such clinical and radiological abnormalities are occasionally the first symptoms leading to diagnosis. Physicians should be aware that unexplained joint pain and effusion, or even radiographic features of osteoarthritis of the large joints in adolescents, may suggest WD and lead to copper testing. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

1672,Wilson's disease in southern Brazil: A 40-year follow-up study,"BACKGROUND: Long-term data on clinical follow-up and treatment effectiveness of Wilson's disease are limited due to the low incidence of the disease. This study evaluated a retrospective cohort of patients with Wilson's disease from southern Brazil during a 40-year follow-up period. METHODS: Thirty-six Wilson's disease patients diagnosed between 1971 and 2010 were retrospectively evaluated for their clinical presentation, epidemiological and social characteristics, response to therapy, and outcome. RESULTS: Examination of the patients' continental origins showed that 74.5% had a European ancestry. The mean age at first symptom presentation was 23.3 +/- 9.3 years, with a delay of 27.5 +/- 41.9 months to the final diagnosis. At presentation, hepatic symptoms were predominant (38.9%), followed by mixed symptoms (hepatic and neuropsychiatric) (30.6%) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (25%). Kayser-Fleischer rings were identified in 55.6% of patients, with a higher frequency in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms (77.8%). Eighteen patients developed neuropsychiatric features, most commonly cerebellar syndrome. Neuroradiological imaging abnormalities were observed in 72.2% of these patients. Chronic liver disease was identified in 68% of patients with hepatic symptoms. 94.2% of all patients were treated with D-penicillamine for an average period of 129.9 +/- 108.3 months. Other treatments included zinc salts, combination therapy, and liver transplantation. After starting therapy, 78.8% of patients had a stable or improved outcome and the overall survival rate was 90.1%. CONCLUSION: This study is the first retrospective description of a population of Wilson's disease patients of mainly continental European descent living in southern Brazil. Wilson's disease is treatable when properly diagnosed and an adequate quality of life can be achieved, resulting in a long overall survival. © 2011 CLINIC.",,"de Bem, R. S.;Muzzillo, D. A.;Deguti, M.

Therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to identify clinical and demographic factors affecting HRQoL in 60 treated, clinically stable patients with WM using a generic questionnaire, the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36 ). . The degree of disability and the grading of multisystem WD manifestations were assessed using the Global Assessment Scale for WD (GAS for WD). The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) assessment were also used by the same trained interviewers. Lower levels in the SF-36 domains were found in patients with neurological diseases compared to patients with a predominantly hepatic form of WD. The HRQoL of patients with WM and psychiatric symptoms was also lower than that of patients without them. Finally, significant inverse correlations were obtained between the different SF-36 domains and all of the following: latency from onset of the first symptoms/signs and start of treatment, MMSE and HDRS scores, and different domains of the GAS for WD. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society.",,"Svetel, M.;Pekmezovic, T.;Tomic, A.;Kresojevic, N.;Potrebic, A.;Jesic, R.;Kostic, V.

1674,Medical Management of Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) in Children (Part II): Focus on the complications of CLD and CLD that require special consideration,"Treating the causes of many chronic liver diseases (CLDs) may not be possible. In this case, complications must be anticipated, prevented or at least controlled by the best available therapeutic modalities. There are three main goals for the treatment of portal hypertension: (i) prevention of the first episode of variceal bleeding largely by non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, which is generally not recommended in children; (ii) control of bleeding using a stepwise approach from least to least invasive strategies; (iii) and prevention of rebleeding from bypass surgery, with particular enthusiasm for the use of meso-rex bypass in the pediatric population. Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy also consists of three main aspects: (i) exclusion of other causes of encephalopathy; (ii) identification and treatment of triggering factors; and (iii) initiation of empiric treatment with drugs such as lactulose, rifaximin, sodium benzoate and flumazenil. Treatment of mild ascites and peripheral edema should begin with sodium and water restriction, followed by careful diuresis, then large-volume paracentesis associated with colloid volume expansion in severe cases. For the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, bacterial and fungal sepsis, and cholangitis, empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy should be used after collection of appropriate cultures, with appropriate therapy modifications after susceptibility testing. Empirical therapies remain standard practice for pruritus; these consist of bile acid sequestrants, phenobarbital (phenobarbitone), ursodeoxycholic acid, antihistamines, rifampin (rifampicin) and carbamazepine. In refractory cases, partial external bile diversion can be used. If hepatorenal syndrome is suspected, treatment should be started early to prevent progression of renal failure; Approaches consist of general supportive measures, management of concomitant complications, screening for sepsis, treatment with antibiotics, use of vasopressin analogues (terlipressin) and, if necessary, renal replacement therapy. Hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension are best treated with liver transplantation. The provision of adequate caloric intake, nutrition and vitamin-mineral supplements to treat growth disorders, necessary vaccinations and special care to ensure mental well-being should be ensured. Anticoagulation may be attempted in acute portal vein thrombosis. Some CLDs, such as B. extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA), Crigler-Najjar syndrome and Indian cirrhosis in childhood, require special considerations. For EHBA, the current standard surgical approach is the Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy in combination with nutritional therapy and supplemental fat and water soluble vitamins, minerals and trace elements. In Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1, comprehensive phototherapy is the mainstay of treatment, in conjunction with adjuvant photobilirubin-binding therapy such as calcium phosphate, cholestyramine, or agar, until liver transplantation can be performed. Treatment of Indian childhood cirrhosis with penicillamine early in the disease course and at similar doses as treatment for Wilson's disease reduces the mortality rate by half. New hopes for the future include extracorporeal liver assist devices (the MARS and Prometheus molecular adsorbent circulatory system), hepatocyte transplantation, liver-directed gene therapy, genetically engineered enzymes, and therapeutic modalities targeting fibrogenesis.

1675,Medical Management of Chronic Liver Disease in Children (Part I): Focus on Curable or Potentially Curable Diseases,"The treatment of children with chronic liver disease (CLD) requires a multidisciplinary approach. CLDs can be categorized as “potentially” curable, treatable, incurable, and end-stage diseases. Goals related to the management of CLDs can be divided into prevention or minimization of progressive liver damage in curable CLD by treating the primary cause; prevention or control of complications of treatable CLD; and predicting outcome in end-stage CLD to allow definitive therapy through surgical interventions, including liver transplantation. Curative, specific therapies that target the primary causes of CLDs are best considered by a pediatric hepatologist when possible. The medical management of CLDs in children is discussed in two parts, with Part I (this article) focusing specifically on ""potentially"" curable CLDs. Dietary modification is the cornerstone of treatment for galactosemia, hereditary fructose intolerance and certain glycogen storage diseases, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. It is also useful in tyrosinemia alongside nitisinone-2-(nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione therapy and in Wilson's disease along with copper chelating agents such as D-penicillamine, triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. Zinc and antioxidants are adjuvant drugs in Wilson's disease. New advances in chronic viral hepatitis have been made with the advent of oral antiviral drugs. In children, currently available drugs to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection are standard interferon (IFN)-alpha-2, pegylated IFN-alpha-2 (PG-IFN), and lamivudine. Adefovir and entecavir have also been approved for adults, while telbivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, clevudine and thymosin alpha-1 are currently in clinical investigation. For chronic hepatitis C virus infection, the most accepted treatment is PG-IFN plus ribavirin. Corticosteroids, with or without azathioprine, remain the basic strategy for inducing remission in autoimmune hepatitis. Ciclosporin (cyclosporine) and other immunosuppressive drugs may be used in patients who do not achieve remission or in whom corticosteroid azathioprine therapy has significant side effects. The above therapies can prevent or at least minimize the progression of liver damage, especially when started early, resulting in a near-normal quality of life in affected children. © 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

Suspicion of Wilson's disease was based on the patient's history and high levels of copper in the urine. The diagnosis was confirmed by liver biopsy followed by genetic testing. Since the patient was obese with a BMI of 60, liver transplantation was not considered. The patient was stabilized and liver function improved under maximally conservative treatment with concomitant treatment with chelating agents. The penicillamine of first choice had to be exchanged for trientine because of an allergic reaction and bone marrow suppression. 18 months after the start of treatment, the patient is doing well, fully compensated with a Child-Pugh A classification (5 points).",,"Petraskova, H.;Novak, F.;Humlova, R.;Bruha, R.",2011,,,0,0,

1685,Transition Metal Homeostasis: From Yeast to Human Disease,"Transition metal ions are essential nutrients for all life forms. Iron, copper, zinc, manganese, cobalt, and nickel all have unique chemical and physical properties that make them attractive molecules for use in biological systems. Many of these same properties that allow these metals to confer essential biochemical activities and structural motifs on a variety of proteins, including enzymes and other cellular components, also result in a potential for cytotoxicity. Organisms have had to evolve a variety of systems for efficient uptake, intracellular transport, protein loading, and storage of metal ions to ensure that the needs of the cells can be met while minimizing associated toxic effects. Disturbances in the cellular systems for handling transition metals are observed in a range of diseases ranging from hemochromatosis and anemia to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be a useful model organism for studying these processes, and many of the genes and biological systems involved in yeast metal homeostasis are conserved from eukaryotes to humans.

1688,Zinc monotherapy is not as effective as chelating agents in treating Wilson's disease,"Background and Objectives: Wilson disease is a genetic disorder that affects copper storage and leads to liver failure and neurological deterioration. Patients are treated with copper chelators and zinc salts, but it is not clear which approach is optimal because studies with large cohorts are few. We evaluated the long-term results of different treatments. Methods: Patients in tertiary care centers were retrospectively analyzed (n = 288; median follow-up 17.1 years) for treatment adherence, survival, treatment failure and adverse events from different treatment regimens (chelating agents, zinc or a combination). Hepatic treatment failure was defined as an increase in activity of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyltransferase) to >2 times the upper limit of normal or >100% of baseline with an increase in urinary copper excretion. Results: The median age at onset of Wilson's disease was 17.5 years. Hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms occurred in 196 (68.1%) and 99 (34.4%) patients, respectively. Hepatic treatment failure was more common with zinc therapy (14/88 treatments) than with chelation therapy (4/313 treatments; p<0.001). Actuarial survival without transplantation showed a benefit for chelating agents (P<0.001 versus zinc). Changes in treatment resulted mainly from adverse events, but the frequency did not differ between groups. Patients who failed to respond to zinc therapy showed improvement in liver function after reintroduction of a chelating agent. Conclusions: Treatments with chelating agents or zinc salt are effective in most patients with Wilson's disease; Chelating agents are better at preventing liver function deterioration. It is important to identify patients who are unresponsive to zinc therapy and have increased activity of liver enzymes, which suggests that a chelating agent should be added to the therapeutic regimen. © 2011 AGA Institute.",,"Weiss, K.

1689,Reorganization of metals: The use of chelating agents as potential therapies for metal-related neurodegenerative diseases,"Metal ions, particularly copper, zinc, and iron, are implicated in several amyloidogenic neurodegenerative diseases. In the brain, as elsewhere in the body, an excess or deficiency of metal ions can potentially inhibit protein function, disrupt proper protein folding, or, in the case of iron or copper, promote oxidative stress. The involvement of metal ions in neurodegenerative diseases has made them an emerging target for therapeutic interventions. One approach has been to chelate and sequester the ions, limiting their potential to disrupt protein folding or render them incapable of undergoing redox processes. Recent approaches suggest that metal ion redistribution has therapeutic benefits, and recent studies indicate that alleviating cellular copper deficiency could be a plausible way to limit neurodegeneration.

1690,Atypical presentation of Wilson's disease,"15-year-old Caucasian woman on a human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) diet presented with fever, cholestasis, coagulopathy, hemolytic anemia, and acute renal dysfunction. Imaging of the biliary system and liver was normal. She responded to intravenous antibiotics, vitamin K, and blood transfusions, but relapsed after stopping the antibiotics. She went into remission with reintroduction of antibiotics. Liver biopsy showed marked biliary tract reaction, bridging fibrosis, and hepatocytic anisocytosis and anisonucleosis with degeneratively enlarged eosinophilic hepatocytes, suggestive of Wilson's disease. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was further made based on low serum ceruloplasmin, elevated copper in urine and liver, and the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings. Multisystem involvement of liver, kidney, blood and brain is consistent with Wilson disease; However, the clinical presentation of cholangitis and reversible coagulopathy is uncommon and may result from concomitant acute cholangitis and/or the patient's HCG diet regimen.

1691,Critical assessment of the Belgian reimbursement dossiers for orphan medicinal products,"Background: Orphan medicines are used to diagnose or treat rare diseases that are serious, life-threatening or chronically debilitating and affect no more than 50 in 100,000 people in the EU. In Belgium, the Drug Reimbursement Committee (DRC) assesses orphan drug reimbursement claims based on several criteria: therapeutic value, price and proposed reimbursement rate; the importance of the drug in clinical practice; and the impact of the drug on the budget. Objectives: This study aimed to assess reimbursement dossiers for orphan medicinal products in Belgium and to compare them with the clinical evidence submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Methods: A qualitative analysis examined all orphan medicinal product reimbursement dossiers submitted in Belgium between January 2002 and June 2008. The following information was extracted from each dossier: description of the orphan medicinal product; Indication; reimbursement status; therapeutic value and needs; budget implications; and number of registered indications. For selected orphan medicinal products, an in-depth analysis extracted and compared information on the clinical trials, their primary endpoints and results from EMA documents (i.e. the Marketing Authorization Application dossier, the European Public Assessment Report and the Summary of Product Characteristics) and the Belgian reimbursement dossiers. Results: Most orphan drugs were awarded reimbursement. In addition to the official criteria, other negotiable factors such as price adjustments, employment incentives, patient population limitations, and the company's funding of diagnostic tests appeared to play a role in the reimbursement decision. Despite the small number of patients, randomized controlled trials have been carried out for many orphan drugs. Budget impact analyzes were simplistic and did not consider impact across multiple indications. Some differences were also noted between the clinical evidence submitted to the EMA and that submitted to the Belgian Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Conclusions: In addition to the official criteria, other negotiable factors such as price adjustments and employment incentives may play a role in Belgian reimbursement decisions for orphan drugs. Some discrepancies were also identified between the clinical evidence reported in EMA documents and the evidence in Belgian orphan medicinal product reimbursement dossiers. There seems to be a need for further standardization of Belgian reimbursement applications and for European collaboration in sharing clinical evidence for orphan drugs. © 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

1692,Wilson's disease: pathogenesis and clinical considerations in diagnosis and treatment,"Almost a century after Dr. Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson wrote his doctoral thesis on the pathologic findings in brain lenticular degeneration associated with liver cirrhosis, we know that the underlying molecular basis for the autosomal recessive disease that now bears his name is a mutation in a copper transporter ATPase, ATP7B, an intracellular copper transporter mainly expressed in hepatocytes. Loss of ATP7B function is the basis for reduced hepatic biliary copper excretion and reduced incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin. In the intervening years, the clinical signs, histological, biochemical features and mutational analysis of ATP7B that characterize this disorder and allow its diagnosis have been recognized. These include the presence of signs of liver or neurological disease and the detection of Kayser-Fleischer rings, low ceruloplasmin, increased urine and liver copper and associated histological changes in the liver. Medical therapies and liver transplantation can effectively treat patients with this once fatal disease. Earlier detection of the disease led to the initiation of treatment to prevent disease progression and to reverse pathologic findings, if present, and family screening to detect the disease in first-degree relatives is warranted. Gene therapy and hepatocyte cell transplantation for Wilson's disease have only been tested in animal models so far, but represent future areas of study. Despite all the advances, we still have to consider the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in order to test patients for this disease and to correctly diagnose it, before committing to lifelong treatment.

1694,Lingual dyskinesia and tics: A novel presentation of disorders of copper metabolism,"Copper is a trace mineral required for cellular respiration, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, pigment formation, antioxidant defense, peptide amidation, and connective tissue formation. Abnormalities in copper metabolism have been linked to neurological disorders that affect movement, such as Wilson's disease and Menkes' disease; However, the diagnosis of non-Wilson-type, non-Menkes-type copper metabolism disorders has been more difficult, especially in cases with atypical features. We present here the case of an adolescent with a novel presentation of a copper metabolism disorder who presented with acute severe hemilingual dyskinesia and prominent tics with ballism of the upper limbs, but had normal brain and spinal MRI results and showed no evidence of dysarthria or dysphagia . His serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were low, but his urine copper level was elevated after penicillamine challenge. We conclude that disorders of copper metabolism should be included in the differential diagnosis of movement disorders, even in cases with very unusual presentations, since many of them are treatable. In addition, to our knowledge, a connection between disorders of copper metabolism and tics is shown for the first time in humans; Further research is needed to better establish this link and to understand the underlying pathophysiology.

1695,Improvement in renal function after renal AVF embolization in a patient who had been on dialysis for 5 years,"Recently, ultrasound-guided percutaneous kidney biopsy has been used to diagnose kidney disease. The development of arteriovenous fistula (AVF), which is one of the post-biopsy complications, is not commonly encountered. AVFs are usually asymptomatic; However, they can lead to serious consequences. We report on a 21-year-old patient who had been on dialysis for 5 years. Due to hypertension (230/160 mmHg) and lumbar tremor detected on physical examination, a Doppler scan was performed and renal AVF was diagnosed. Since the patient had a kidney biopsy 5 years ago, the fistula was assumed to be secondary to the biopsy. After AVF embolization, renal function improved sufficiently to complete dialysis treatment.

1697,DNA and RNA studies for the molecular characterization of a gross deletion detected in homozygosity in the NH2-terminal region of the ATP7B gene in a patient with Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by defective function of the copper-transporting protein ATP7B. About 520 mutations that cause Wilson disease have been described to date. In this study, we report the use of DNA and RNA analyzes for the molecular characterization of a gross deletion of the ATP7B gene found in homozygosity in a patient with Wilson's disease. The c.51+384_1708-953del mutation spans an 8798 bp region of the ATP7B gene from exon 2 to intron 4. The results obtained suggest that the combination of DNA and RNA analyzes for the molecular characterization of gross ATP7B -Deletions can be used, thus improving genetic counseling and diagnosis of Wilson's disease.

1698,Rheumatic manifestations associated with Wilson's disease. [French],"Wilson disease (WD) is a rare disease defined as an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by release of free copper and dramatic accumulation of intracellular copper in the liver with subsequent liver and central nervous system abnormalities. Mutations in the ATP7B gene are responsible for the metabolic disease. A limited number of small studies allow for radiological abnormalities of the spine, including diffuse bone demineralization, osteochondritis, and occasionally fractures. In a prospective study, the prevalence of osteoporosis was 10% with normal mean Z-score values and the prevalence of a history of fracture was 50%. Joint disorders include arthralgias of large joints such as knee pain, infrequent effusions, early onset of radiographic features of osteoarthritis, and associated osteochondritis. Some patients may develop drug-induced lupus with arthralgia, positive antinuclear and antihistone antibodies, secondary to D-penicillamine, the main copper chelator used in WD. In this rare disease, small retrospective studies cannot identify clear MV-related joint and bone manifestations. Such clinical and radiographic abnormalities are occasionally the first symptoms leading to diagnosis. However, unexplained joint pain and effusions of the large joints in adolescents could indicate WD and lead to copper testing. Treatment of bone disease and fractures is common in the general population. © 2011 Société francaise de rhumatologie.",,"Quemeneur, A. S.;Trocello, J. M.;de Vernejoul, M.

Although fulminant hepatitis with nonimmune hemolytic anemia is commonly reported, chronic mild hepatitis with attacks of transient hemolytic anemia can occur. We report on a 16-year-old woman who presented with fatigue, dizziness, and new onset jaundice. She had hemolytic anemia, although the diagnosis of Wilson's disease was initially confused by a family history of autoimmunity with a high rate of erythrocyte sedimentation and only slightly elevated bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase.

1704,Alzheimer's & Metals: Therapeutic Possibilities,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease. There are currently no disease-modifying drugs, and existing therapies only provide short-term symptom relief. Two of the pathognomonic indicators of AD are the presence of extracellular protein aggregates composed mainly of the Abeta peptide and oxidative stress. Both phenomena can possibly be explained by the interactions of Abeta with metal ions. Furthermore, metal ions play a central role in synaptic function and their homeostasis is tightly regulated. A breakdown of this metal homeostasis and the formation of toxic Abeta oligomers are likely responsible for the synaptic dysfunction associated with AD. Therefore, approaches aimed at preventing Abeta–metal interactions, inhibiting the formation of toxic Abeta species, and restoring metal homeostasis could be considered as disease-modifying strategies for the treatment of AD. This review article summarizes the physiological and pathological interactions that metal ions play in synaptic function, with particular emphasis on interactions with Abeta. A variety of therapeutic strategies that have been developed to address these pathological processes are also described. The most advanced of these strategies is the so-called “Metal Protein Attenuation Compound” approach, in which the lead molecule PBT2 has successfully completed early-stage clinical trials. The success of these various strategies suggests that manipulation of metal ion interactions offers multiple avenues to develop disease-modifying therapies for AD. © 2011 The Authors.

1708,Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper disposition caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, located on chromosome 13. This gene encodes a P-type adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) known as Wilson's ATPase, which transports copper across intracellular membranes in hepatocytes. The copper-transporting effect directly supports the production of the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin, into which copper is incorporated, and the excretion of copper in the bile. Consequently, in Wilson's disease, serum concentrations of copper are low and copper retention in the liver develops, leading to liver damage. Wilson disease can present as a hepatic, neurological, or psychiatric condition; The clinical phenotypes are very different. Other organ systems can also be involved. Although the usual age range for clinical presentation is 5 to 45 years, younger children and older adults can also be affected by this disease. Clinical evaluations include liver function tests, cerebral imaging, serum ceruloplasmin and copper, 24-hour basal urinary copper measurement, and hepatic parenchymal copper concentration. Genetic diagnosis is complex but definitive and is best used for family studies. Treatment is usually very effective and consists of lifelong administration of a chelating agent (D-penicillamine or trientine) or zinc in pharmacological doses. Liver transplantation is almost always required in patients with fulminant hepatic failure (coagulopathy, encephalopathy, massive intravascular hemolysis, renal failure, elevated aminotransferases, subnormal alkaline phosphatase) or in patients whose liver disease is unresponsive to medical treatment. Liver cancer is extremely rare in people with Wilson's disease, but screening may be appropriate in older patients. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,"Roberts, E.

1710,Access to orphan drugs despite poor clinical evidence,"OBJECTIVE We analyzed Belgian reimbursement decisions for orphan medicines versus innovative medicines for more common but equally serious diseases, paying particular attention to the quality of clinical evidence. METHODS Using the National Health Insurance Agency's administrative database, we assessed all orphan drug dossier submissions between 2002 and 2007. A quality analysis of the clinical evidence in the orphan medicinal product reimbursement records was performed. The French Haute Autorite de Sante assessment reports, including the five-level Service Medical Rendu (SMR) parameter, were examined to compare disease severity. Chi-square tests (at a significance level of P<0.05) were used to compare the outcome of reimbursement decisions between innovative orphan and non-orphan medicinal products. RESULTS Twenty-five orphan medicinal product files and 117 orphan medicinal product files were evaluated. Twenty-two of 25 (88%) orphan drug submissions were granted reimbursement, in contrast to 74 of the 117 (63%) innovative non-orphan drugs (P=0.02). Only 52% of the 25 orphan drug records contained a randomized controlled trial as opposed to 84% in a random control sample of 25 non-rare innovative submissions (P < 0.01). In most cases, the duration of drug exposure was much too short in relation to the natural course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS Orphan drug status predicts reimbursement despite poor-quality clinical evidence. The evidence gap for marketing authorization should be reduced through post-marketing programs in which the centralized regulatory authorities and the local reimbursement authorities in the Member States of the European Union work together efficiently. © 2011 The Authors.

1712,Late diagnosis of Wilson's disease with hepatic and neurological manifestations,"50-year-old woman was referred to our clinic because of liver dysfunction and progressive neurological symptoms. She had previously been diagnosed with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) had effectively normalized her serum aminotransferase levels, but she presented with vestibular disturbances, dysarthria, and difficulty in handwriting. Autoantibodies and hepatitis virus markers were negative. Serum ceruloplasmin and copper were found to be 9 mg/dL and 32 mg/dL, respectively. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion was 331.8 mg/day. The Kayser-Fleischer ring was detected. Histological examination of the liver showed inflammatory infiltrate and fibrosis, and the hepatic copper concentration was 444.4 mg/g dry weight. We diagnosed her with Wilson's disease and began treatment with trientine. Immunohistochemistry for keratin 8 and p62 showed Mallory Denk bodies. Many of the p62 expressing cells were positive for 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). Few Ki-67 positive hepatocytes were present in the liver. Wilson's disease is one of the causes of NASH and UDCA can be an adjuvant therapeutic agent for Wilson's disease. Cell proliferation is suppressed under copper-loaded conditions and this phenomenon may be associated with the clinical course of Wilson's disease.

1713,Wilson's disease in adults. [French],"Purpose: Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism characterized by accumulation of copper in the body due to defective biliary copper excretion by hepatocytes. We report a series of 19 patients with WD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective and descriptive case series of patients with WM studied in two hospitals in north-eastern France. Results: Eight men and 11 women were examined. The median follow-up time was 16 years and the median age at diagnosis was 18 years (range: 5-71 years). The median age at first symptom was 16 years. In addition to four cases diagnosed through familial screening, the clinical manifestations at diagnosis were fatigue (n=5), jaundice (n=5), bleeding (n=1), abnormal movement disorders (n=2), and incidental ( n = 2). ). Cirrhosis was identified in 14 patients, neurological involvement occurred in seven patients and four patients with psychiatric disorders. D-penicillamine was the first treatment in 18 patients, which was discontinued in seven patients due to serious adverse events. Then trientine or zinc salts were prescribed. Drug treatment was successful in 13 patients, but five patients underwent liver transplantation. In one case hemochromatosis was associated and one patient developed cholangiocarcinoma. Conclusion: WD is serious. Medical treatment enables disease control when properly followed.

1714,"Pathology, clinic and treatment of congenital disorders of copper metabolism - focus on neurological aspects","Genetic disorders of copper metabolism, including Menkes-kinky hair disease (MD), occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and Wilson's disease (WD), are discussed with an emphasis on the neurological aspects. MD and OHS are X-linked recessive disorders characterized by copper deficiency. Typical features of MD, such as neurological disorders, connective tissue disorders and hair abnormalities, can be explained by the unusually low activity of copper-dependent enzymes. The current standard of care for the treatment of MD is parenteral administration of copper histidine. If treatment is started in neonates, neurological degeneration can be prevented, but delayed treatment is significantly less effective. In addition, copper histidine treatment does not improve connective tissue disorders. Novel treatments targeting neurological and connective tissue disorders need to be developed. OHS is the mildest form of MD and is characterized by connective tissue abnormalities. Although no formal studies have been conducted for OHS, OHS patients are typically treated in a manner similar to MD. WD is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the toxic effects of chronic exposure to high levels of copper. Although the liver and nervous systems are typically most severely affected, initial symptoms vary, making early diagnosis difficult. Because early treatment is often critical, particularly in patients with neurological disorders, medical education efforts for early diagnosis should focus on primary care physicians. Cheating agents and zinc are effective in treating WM, but neurological symptoms temporarily worsen soon after treatment with chelating agents. It has been reported that neurological deterioration in patients treated with tetrathiomolybdate was lower than the rates of neurological deterioration when treated with other chelating agents.

Among a variety of methods available to measure thiol concentrations, chemical derivatization using an appropriate labeling reagent, followed by liquid chromatographic or electrophoretic separation, is the most reliable means of sensitively and specifically determining thiol compounds in real samples. UV detection is a commonly used technique in liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis because of its simplicity, and consequently many UV derivatization reagents are used.

Corpus callosum (CC) lesions have not been studied in a broad population of patients with WM. Aim: To evaluate the frequency of CC lesions in patients with neurological symptoms associated with WM. Methods: The authors included all patients with neurological manifestations of WD observed at the French National Center for WD who had brain MRI between March 2006 and December 2008. The localization of brain lesions was analyzed and the frequency of lesions in CC was assessed. All patients were evaluated using the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale. Clinical dysconnexion syndrome has been studied in patients with abnormalities in the CC. RESULTS: Of 81 patients (45 males, mean age: 34.8 years, range 12 to 74 years) with neurological manifestations, 42% had white matter lesions on liquid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI. 23.4% of patients had CC lesions limited to the posterior portion (splenium).

(1) * Based on strong evidence, HAV vaccination is strongly recommended for all children with chronic liver disease.

1720,A clinical evaluation of Wilson's disease in patients with concomitant liver disease,"Objectives: To study variations in the clinical epidemiology of Wilson's disease in patients with coexisting liver disease and the impact of coexisting disease on current diagnostic algorithms. Background: Wilson disease is a rare condition and studies on its diagnosis and natural history are scarce. Currently available tools have limited effectiveness in complex patients, and the presence of comorbidities may further limit their use. In-depth analysis of Wilson's disease in complex patients with comorbidities will help improve algorithms for earlier diagnosis and treatment. STUDY: A retrospective cohort study using data from a large tertiary care center to conduct a clinical evaluation of Wilson's disease in patients with co-existing liver disease. Results: 42 patients with Wilson's disease were identified; 9 had comorbid liver disease. The mean age at diagnosis was significantly higher in patients with concomitant liver disease than in those without underlying disease (49.1 years vs. 26.8 years, P<0.0001). Patients with co-existing liver disease had more evidence of cirrhosis at presentation (9/9, 100% vs 15/33, 45.5%) and had a higher mortality (4/8, 50% vs 4/ 29, 13.8%, P=0.0222). Without mutation analysis data, a definitive diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made using the Leipzig criteria in 44% of patients with coexisting liver disease. Conclusions: Patients with concomitant liver disease were diagnosed with Wilson disease at significantly older ages, had more liver cirrhosis, and had higher mortality. Mutation analysis is critical for definitive diagnosis in complex cohorts and those with intermediate Leipzig scores. Copyright © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",,"Wong, R.

1721,Recurrent bleeding and bulbar myasthenia-like symptoms as initial presentation of Wilson's disease: A case report,"Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, is usually associated with hepatic or neuropsychiatric manifestations. This is to describe a case of Wilson's disease presenting with recurrent bleeding and symptoms similar to bulbar myasthenia. A 12-year-old Hindu girl presented initially with recurrent bleeding manifestations of epistaxis, hematemesis, and melaena, followed by dysphagia with fatigue at 2 years. The bleeding was initially attributed to thrombocytopenia and the dysphagia went unrecognized as tests for myasthenia gravis were negative. Four years later, the patient developed nasal intonation of the voice with fatigue, followed by a decline in academic performance. The patient was examined in our institute and subtle extrapyramidal signs were noted in the form of asymmetric cecal dystonia and bradykinesia. Clinical evaluation, laboratory and radiological investigations led to the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. The cause of the bleeding was most likely a defect in platelet function. No other cause of her bulbar myasthenia-like symptoms was apparent. This case illustrates that platelet dysfunction should also be considered in all patients with Wilson's disease who are bleeding. In the case of bulbar myasthenia-like symptoms and an unclear diagnosis, if hepatosplenomegaly is present, Wilson's disease should be considered as a differential diagnosis.",,"Prasun, N.;Bagchi, M.;Joseph, A.;Pal, S.;Ghosh, S.;Mukherjee, S.;Senapati, A.

The resulting accumulation of copper primarily damages the liver and brain, leading to hepatic, neurological and psychiatric symptoms. There have been many recent studies that have advanced understanding of Wilson's disease in Asia. There is evidence that the incidence of Wilson's disease may be relatively high in parts of Asia. Many genetic studies have identified different hot spots in the ATP7B gene in different Asian populations. Screening for these hotspot mutations can therefore be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Despite advances in treatment, unfamiliarity with health professionals, leading to late diagnosis, and poor access to treatment, particularly among people from the developing world, remain areas of concern.",,"Zhang, Y.;Wu, Z.

1723,Therapeutic potential of copper chelate with triethylenetetramine in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease,"This article reviews recent evidence, much of it generated by my group's research program, which has identified for the first time a previously unknown copper overload state central to the pathogenesis of diabetic organ damage. This condition causes tissue damage in blood vessels, heart, kidneys, retina, and nerves from copper-mediated oxidative stress. This author now considers this copper overload condition as an important new target for therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing or reversing diabetic complications. Triethylenetetramine (TETA) was recently identified as the first of a new class of diabetic molecules by the original work discussed here, providing a new use for this molecule, previously approved by the US FDA in 1985 as a second-line treatment for Wilson's disease was approved. TETA acts as a highly selective divalent copper (CuII) chelating agent that prevents or reverses diabetic copper overload and thereby suppresses oxidative stress. TETA treatment of diabetic animals and patients has identified and quantified the interconnected defects in copper metabolism that characterize this systemic copper overload condition. Copper overload in diabetes mellitus differs from that in Wilson's disease by differences in their respective causative molecular mechanisms and consequent differences in tissue localization and behavior of excess copper. Increased pathogenetic tissue binding of copper occurs in diabetes. It may well be mediated through modification of the advanced glycation end product (AGE) of vulnerable amino acid residues in long-lived fibrous proteins, for example connective tissue collagens at sites such as blood vessel walls. These AGE modifications can act as localized, fixed endogenous chelators that increase the chelatable copper content of organs such as the heart and kidneys by binding excessive amounts of catalytically active CuII in certain vascular beds, thereby concentrating the associated copper-mediated oxidative stress on vulnerable tissues . In this review, pooled findings from our clinical studies in healthy volunteers and diabetics with left ventricular hypertrophy, as well as from nonclinical models of diabetic heart, artery, kidney and nerve disease are used to create descriptions of the mechanisms by which TETA treatment occurs prevents injuries and regenerates damaged organs. Our recent phase II proof-of-principle studies in patients with type 2 diabetes and in nonclinical models of diabetes have helped define the pathogenetic defects in copper regulation and have shown that they are reversible by TETA . The drug tightly binds and extracts excess systemic CuII into the urine while neutralizing its catalytic activity, but does not cause systemic copper deficiency even after prolonged use. Its physicochemical properties, which are critical to its safety and efficacy, clearly differentiate it from all other clinically available transition metal chelating agents, including D-penicillamine, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and clioquinol, and support its advancement as a new antidiabetic drug. Trientine (TETA dihydrochloride) has been used as a second-line treatment for Wilson's disease since the mid-1980s, and our recent clinical studies have reinforced the impression that it is probably safe for long-term use in patients with diabetes and related metabolic disorders. There is substantial evidence supporting the view that diabetes shares many pathogenetic mechanisms with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Indeed, the close epidemiological and molecular links between them point to the vascular dementia of Alzheimer's disease as another therapeutic target, where an experimental pharmacotherapy with TETA may well find further clinical application. © 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

1724,Mapping brain metals to evaluate therapies for neurodegenerative diseases,"The brain is rich in metals and has a high metabolic rate, making it acutely vulnerable to the toxic effects of endogenously produced free radicals. The abundant metals iron and copper transfer single electrons when moving between reduced (Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>1+</sup>) and oxidized (Fe<sup>3+</sup> /sup >, Cu<sup>2+</sup>) states, making them effective catalysts for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Even redoxinated zinc, when in excess, can indirectly trigger ROS production by altering mitochondrial function. While metal chelators appear to improve the clinical outcome of several neurodegenerative diseases, their mechanisms of action remain unclear and the effects of long-term use are largely unknown. Most chelating agents are not specific for a single metal and could alter the distribution of multiple metals in the brain, leading to unexpected long-term consequences. We show here how X-ray fluorescence will be a valuable tool to study the effect of chelating agents on the distribution and abundance of metals in the brain. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Gh Popescu, B.

1725,Sleep disorders in Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder with copper accumulation; Neurodegeneration is associated with a dopaminergic deficit. The aim of the study is to review sleep comorbidity using questionnaires and objective sleep studies (polysomnography, multiple sleep latency test). METHODS: Fifty-five patients with MV (22 hepatic, 28 neurological, five asymptomatic forms) and 55 age- and sex-matched controls completed a questionnaire on their sleeping habits, sleep comorbidity, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and rapid eye movement behavior disorder screening questions (REM) (RBD-SQ). Twenty-four patients with WM and controls underwent polysomnography. Results: Unlike controls, patients with WM were more prone to afternoon naps, accompanied by fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy-like episodes, and poor nighttime sleep. Their mean ESS and RBD-SQ were higher than controls. Total sleep time was shorter, accompanied by reduced sleep efficiency and increased alertness. Patients with WD had lower latency of stage 1 and stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and a lower amount of stage 2 NREM sleep. One-third of patients with WD experienced brief or borderline sleep multiple sleep latency test detected (MSLT) values independent of nocturnal pathology (sleep apnea, periodic leg movements and/or restless legs syndrome). Conclusions: Patients with WM frequently suffer from sleep disturbances (regardless of the clinical form). The spectrum of sleep-wake symptoms suggests that altered REM sleep function may also be involved. © 2010 The author(s).

1730,Mowat-Wilson syndrome; First Case in Qatar Identified by Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (ACGH),"Mowat-Wilson Syndrome (MWS) is a recently described mental retardation syndrome, usually associated with multiple health conditions, and characterized by a typical facial appearance. About 200 cases have been reported worldwide, mostly in Europe and North America. The syndrome occurs as a result of heterozygous mutations or deletions in the zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox-2 gene, ZEB2, formerly called ZFHX1B (SIP1), located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at 2q22. The mutation spectrum includes point mutations (81%), medium and large mutations (17%), or large-scale rearrangements (2%). We report the first case of MWS in Qatar. The 2-year-old patient has features of MWS. Array comparison analysis of genomic hybridization (aCGH) was performed using a 44k ISCA design oligonucleotide platform. The patient was found to have a de novo deletion of ~500 kb at 2q22. Routine chromosome analysis was normal. aCGH is a relatively new technology that has revolutionized the field of clinical genetic diagnostics. The aCGH can detect unbalanced chromosomal aberrations, including microdeletion, microduplication, aneuploidy, unbalanced translocations, and changes in subtelomeric and pericentromeric copy number throughout the genome. Unlike conventional cytogenetics, aCGH can detect deletions and duplications smaller than 5 megabases and, unlike monochromatic FISH, look for multiple aberrations simultaneously. This case underscores the value of array-CGH for detecting or characterizing chromosomal rearrangements in patients with intellectual disability with/without dysmorphic features and multiple congenital anomalies.",,"Zafar, N.;Khitam, A.

However, 30 to 50% of patients with neurological symptoms may experience worsening of their symptoms at the beginning of treatment. Trientine is the second drug of choice in Japan.

Dietary zinc deficiency can affect nearly 2 billion people in developing countries. Consuming high phytate grain proteins decreases the availability of zinc for absorption. Conditional zinc deficiency is also very common. Growth retardation, male hypogonadism, rough skin, compromised immunity, neurosensory disorders, and cognitive impairment are some of the clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency. Zinc is involved in many biochemical functions. Over 300 enzymes require zinc for their activation and nearly 2000 transcription factors require zinc to control gene expression. Zinc is also essential for cell-mediated immunity. Zinc is an effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. At therapeutic doses, zinc has been used to treat acute diarrhea in infants and children, the common cold, Wilson's disease, sickle cell anemia, and to prevent blindness in patients with age-related macular degeneration.",,"Prasad, A.

1734,The role of Sip1 in the development of the cranial neural crest,"Smad-interacting protein-1 (Sip1/Zeb2/Zfhx1b) is a highly conserved member of the two-handed zinc-finger homeodomain family of transcriptional repressors that have been shown to regulate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition during tumor progression. In addition, Sip1 is involved in neural and anterior-posterior pattern formation during embryonic development. The truncation of Sip1 proteins is also implicated in neural crest-related disorders; Mowat-Wilson syndrome and Hirschsprung disease. We started to study the spatiotemporal expression pattern and function of Sip1 in the neural crest during chick embryonic development. Using translation-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides injected after the onset of neural development, loss-of-function experiments were performed to assess the role of Sip1 during cranial neural crest development. With this approach, we can determine whether Sip1 functions similarly in cancer cells and neural crest EMT, and whether it has additional functions during embryonic development. Our results indicate that loss of Sip1 does not affect cranial crest specification, but prevents or delays crest migration from the dorsal neural tube. Future studies will identify the mechanism by which Sip1 regulates the onset of migration in these cells.",,"Rogers, C.;Bronner-Fraser, M.",2011,2022-08-01 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.05.416,0,0,

Movements were suppressed when the patient was asked to stick out his tongue; they did not interfere with swallowing or speech and did not stop during sleep. On examination, sudden ballistic and tic-like movements of all limbs were noted, which could be suppressed at will. Otherwise normal neurological findings. Extensive metabolic, hematological, and serological investigations were normal. Serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels were low; 24-hour urine collection showed normal copper excretion, but penicillamine challenge showed increased urinary copper excretion. These elevations were higher than the norm but still significantly lower than the diagnostic value for Wilson's disease. Brain MRI was normal. Screening for Wilson's and Huntington's disease was negative. The patient was started on zinc gluconate supplementation.

1736,A young woman with acute fulminant liver failure and severe hemolysis,"LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 1. Recognize the main clinical features of WilsonaTM disease, including the findings of the physical examination. 2. Administering the treatment of acute fulminant hepatic failure due to WilsonaTM disease. CASE INFORMATION: A 22-year-old woman presents with 3 days of yellowing of her eyes and skin. She also noted that her urine was dark and her stools had been a light green color for 3 weeks, accompanied by mild abdominal discomfort. She had never consumed alcohol and had taken no prescription or over-the-counter medications. She had no prior sexual contact and no significant family medical history. Notably, she had been told she had ""abnormal liver function"" as revealed by routine blood tests 8 months earlier. She was afebrile with normal hemodynamics. Jaundice with severely icteric sclera and mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant without significant hepatomegaly were evident on examination. She was neurologically intact and Guaiac stool was negative. Her initial laboratory values included creatinine 1.5, hematocrit 20%, platelets 135, bilirubin 59, direct bilirubin 34, AST 195, ALT of 27, alkaline phosphatase 14, LDH 1588, albumin 3.1 and INR 3.3. The paracetamol level was 30.5 (upper normal value 30). The slit lamp ophthalmological examination showed golden-brown deposits at the level of the DescemetaTM membrane. Her serum copper level was elevated to 220. While an emerging plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma substitute was initiated to ameliorate the severe intravascular hemolysis and resulting acute renal failure (ARF), she was classified as Status 1A for liver transplantation with a presumptive diagnosis of WilsonaTM disease. On day 2, continuous renal replacement therapy was started for worsening ARF (creatinine 2.4), increasing the MELD score from 39 to 48. The patient successfully underwent orthotopic liver transplantation on day 4 and was subsequently discharged home on day 18 of hospitalization. Liver histology using rhodanine staining revealed cirrhosis with occasional nodules in which all hepatocytes and scattered macrophages contained granular intracytoplasmic copper. IMPLICATIONS/DISCUSSION: Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with mutations in the ATP7B gene that impairs the transport of copper from hepatocytes to the bile, resulting in copper accumulation in tissues such as the liver, brain, kidneys and cornea. The disease was first clinically described by K. Wilson in 1912 as progressive hepato-lenticular degeneration, reflecting that the primary manifestations of the disease are related to copper deposits in the liver and lens nuclei of the brain. The hepatic presentation is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic to acute fulminant liver failure. About half of patients present with no symptoms or with chronic liver disease. These patients typically have low ceruloplasmin levels and frequently (50%) pathognomonic Kayser-Fleischer rings on slit lamp examination; They are typically treated as outpatients with chronic chelation and/or zinc therapy. However, fulminant hepatic presentations occur in up to 25% of cases, more frequently in women than in men (4:1). Major clinical features include rapidly progressive renal tubular disease, Coombs-negative acute intravascular hemolysis, and laboratory discrepancy manifesting as only mildly elevated serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase but extremely elevated bilirubin levels. Acute hepatocellular necrosis results in the release of copper ions into the circulation with toxic oxidative effects on red blood cell pathways and consequent hemolysis and renal failure. In fulminant liver failure, acute plasma exchange is the preferred surrogate to liver transplantation because it can rapidly remove relatively large amounts of copper and ameliorate hemolysis and further kidney damage. Due to the otherwise high mortality rate and the curative potential of transplantation, patients with fulminant liver failure due to Wilson's disease are appropriately given the highest priority category for liver transplantation.",,"Zahiruddin, A.;Leung, S.;LeFrancois, D.",2011,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-011-1814-6,0,0,
1737,"Enhancement of oncolytic viral therapy with an angiogenesis inhibitor, ATN-224","Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are genetically engineered viruses specifically designed to destroy only cancer cells. Within the tumor microenvironment, the angiogenic and inflammatory responses following OV inoculation have significantly limited the efficacy of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) in clinical trials. Physiological levels of copper support angiogenesis and can inhibit replication of wild-type HSV. Here we tested whether OV efficacy could be mediated by ATN-224, a second-generation analog of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate(TM), a copper chelating agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Wilson's disease and currently under investigation could be improved as an antiangiogenic and antineoplastic agent in clinical trials. Under serum concentration of copper, both OV replication and glioma cell killing were significantly inhibited (P<0.001). ATN-224 treatment rescued this copper-mediated inhibition of OV replication and cytotoxicity in vitro (P<0.01). Antitumor efficacy was evaluated in vivo using two xenograft glioma models. First, mice implanted with subcutaneous U251T3 gliomas were treated with PBS, ATN-224, OV or OV + ATN224 (n=10). The mean tumor size in the OV + ATN224 group was significantly smaller than in the OV-only group (21.51 vs. 153.93 mm < P = 0.0383). Next, mice implanted with intracranial U87deltaEGFR gliomas were treated as previously described (n=8). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a longer median survival time in the OV + ATN224 group than in the OV-only group (43,875 days vs. 24,000 days). To search for a biological explanation for this enhanced efficacy, we evaluated U251T3 tumors from OV-treated mice that received ATN-224 or PBS co-treatment. Analysis revealed that tumors treated with ATN-224 had a significantly increased virus presence in vivo compared to tumors treated with PBS. This result was observed when OV was administered both intratumorally (P<0.05) and intravenously. Therefore, the reduced tumor growth and increased survival previously demonstrated in vivo could be associated with enhanced viral replication. Overall, our results strongly suggest that concomitant treatment of ATN-224 with OV can significantly improve the poor efficacy profile of conventional clinical oncolytic virotherapy.",,"Pradarelli, J.;Yoo, J.

1738,Case report: catatonia as a symptom of Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. Clinical manifestations are caused by copper deposits in various parts of the body. Psychiatric symptoms (mood and psychotic) may occur in 25% of patients with Wilson's disease. Case Report: A 19-year-old male patient presented with refusal to eat, trouble sleeping, maintaining posture, agitation, echopraxia, perseveration, decreased self-care, minimal speaking, distrust that people are opposed to and discussing him, for 2 months duration. There was no previous or familial h/o mental illness. On mental status examination, the patient had decreased psychomotor activity with occasional agitation, negativism, posturing, ecoprexia, perseveration, and delusions and persecution. General physical examination and systemic examination were normal. He was diagnosed as catatonic schizophrenia and treated with trifluperazine and 4 ECTs. At subsequent follow-up, the trifluperazine dose was increased, and within 4 days he exhibited severe EPS and catatonic symptoms. The Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale score was 30 on admission. Antipsychotics were discontinued, there was slow improvement in his EPS but catatonic symptoms persisted, quetiapine, which has a low propensity for EPS, was started, and ECTs were continued. Since he was a young boy with a second degree blood relationship and was susceptible to EPS, we thought of Wilson's disease and examined him. Investigations: Routine investigations were normal and an MRI scan of the brain showed no copper deposition in the basal ganglia. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion was 2165 mg/l, serum ceruloplasmin 45 u/l and serum copper 160 µg/dl. Slit lamp examination of the eye and X-ray of the hand were within the normal range. After starting zinc 50 mg tid and ECTs, he showed significant improvement in symptoms and was discharged. Conclusion: Catatonia is rarely associated with Wilson's disease. Because effective treatment is available, it is important to make this diagnosis early.",,"Shetageri, V. N.;Bhogale, G. S.;Patil, N. M.;Nayak, R. B.;Chate, S. S.",2011,April,,0,0,
1739,Metabolism of triethylenetetramine and its impact on cancer chemotherapy,"Triethylenetetramine (TETA), a copper(II) chelator and polyamine analogue traditionally used to treat Wilson's disease, is currently in Phase I clinical trials for cancer in combination with carboplatin. However, the metabolism of TETA has never been thoroughly studied, which is crucial for its advancement in cancer treatment1. The two main metabolites of TETA found in humans are N<sup>1</sup>-acetyl-TETA (MAT) and N<sup>1</sup>,N<sup>10</sup>-diacetyl-TETA ( DAT)<sup>2</sup>. Traditionally, drug acetylation has been thought to be catalyzed by N-acetyltransferase (NAT2). The FDA requires that the pharmacological properties of all drugs metabolized via the acetylation pathway be evaluated in populations with different NAT2 phenotypes. However, our recent clinical study showed that there was no significant difference in the pharmacokinetic and metabolite profiles of healthy volunteers with fast or slow NAT2 acetylation phenotype<sup>3</sup>. We therefore hypothesize that the enzyme responsible for TETA acetylation is spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase (SSAT). We performed in vitro drug metabolism assays to localize the enzyme responsible for TETA metabolism. TETA (as a substrate) and acetyl-coenzyme A were incubated with human liver microsome and cytosol from 7 subjects separately in the presence or absence of pentamidine or acetaminophen. The formation of MAT from TETA was detected and measured using our previously published LC-MS method<sup>2</sup>. Both the liver microsome and the cytosol could catalyze the biotransformation of TETA. There is a large inter-individual difference in the rate of metabolism in microsomes and cytosol (K<inf>m</inf> range 181 - 12,457 muM, V<inf>max</inf> range 110 - 3,068 pg/min/ mg protein ). Pentamidine, a specific inhibitor of SSAT, could inhibit the response and increase Km by over 30%. While acetaminophen, a specific inhibitor of NAT2, showed no inhibitory effect. The same experiments were performed in rat liver microsomes and cytosol and, apart from the K<inf>m</inf> and V<inf>max</inf> values, similar results were obtained. Two other polyamine analogs, diethylnorspermine and diethylspermine, all of which are being studied for the treatment of cancer, were also studied and similar results were obtained. The identification of SSAT, never before considered a xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme, as the enzyme catalyzing the acetylation of polyamine analogs has significant implications in cancer combination chemotherapy. The finding of SSAT (rather than NAT2) as the metabolic enzyme of TETA suggests that TETA might be an ideal candidate for combination chemotherapy in cancer, since anticancer drugs are rarely metabolized through this pathway; therefore, competition for drug metabolizing enzyme is less likely to occur. However, it appears that individuals have different SSAT phenotypes and this must be taken into account when using TETA as a chemotherapy drug.",,"Lu, J.;Li, M.;Tingle, M.;Xu, H.;Cooper, G. J.

1740,Abdominal pain and gastritis as side effects of zinc therapy in children with Wilson's disease,"Aims and Study: Zinc compounds are widely used in the treatment of Wilson's disease and are considered safe and well-tolerated. Occasionally, however, patients report abdominal pain and nausea and require a change in pharmacotherapy. Aside from abdominal pain, these side effects have not been thoroughly studied. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence and characterize side effects of zinc therapy in children with Wilson's disease. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a group of 37 patients (20 females, 17 males, mean age 12 years (6'18 years)) with a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson's disease (according to Ferenci score and mutation analysis). They were treated with zinc sulfate for 83.3 (8,344) weeks [median (range)]. All patient complaints were considered potential drug side effects. Results: Adverse reactions, all of gastrointestinal origin: abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, were observed in 12 children (9 females, 3 males, mean age 10.7 years). They occurred after 67.1 (8,344) weeks of zinc sulfate therapy. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed in 4 patients with persistent and severe abdominal pain and revealed gastritis with mucosal ulcerations and a negative H. pylori test in all subjects examined. In 2 children the symptoms disappeared on proton pump inhibitors, in other 2 cases an additional switch to penicillamine was required. 2 patients with abdominal pain did not consent to the EGD. In the remaining patients, clinical improvement was observed after switching to zinc acetate (2 patients), D-penicillamine (4 patients), or introduction of the alternative zinc sulfate dosing regimen (2 patients). Conclusion: It seems that side effects such as abdominal pain, nausea and even gastritis are relatively common in patients treated with zinc sulfate. They can occur at different stages of therapy. EGD should be performed in selected patients to detect and treat upper gastrointestinal inflammation. Discontinuation of zinc sulfate is often unavoidable and switching to penicillamine or zinc acetate may be a safer option for these patients.",,"Janowska, A.;Janczyk, W.;Dadalski, M.;Socha, P.",2011,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e318224e326,0,0,
1741,Long-term zinc therapy in children with Wilson's disease and mild liver disease,"Aims and study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a disorder of copper metabolism. In pediatric age, most cases have a hepatic presentation: the percentage of WM children with isolated elevated aminotransferases ranges from 14% to 88%. It is generally accepted that penicillamine is the first-line therapy for children with liver disease, while zinc is indicated in pre-symptomatic patients and as maintenance therapy. The optimal drug therapy for patients with isolated elevated serum aminotransferases has not yet been established. This reflects the lack of agreement on the classification of WM patients with isolated hypertransaminasemia as presymptomatic cases requiring zinc or cases of hepatic onset requiring chelating agents. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of zinc-only monotherapy in children with MS with isolated hypertransaminasemia. Methods: All MV patients referred to our children's hospital for diagnostic testing of elevated serum aminotransferases were analyzed. Diagnosis of WM was made by the presence of at least 2 of the following: low ceruloplasmin (< 20 mg/dL), elevated basal urinary copper (> 100 mcg/24 hours), elevated urinary copper by penicillamine challenge (PCT; >1575 mcg/24 hours), an elevated liver copper level (>250 mg/g dry weight). Of the 43 enrolled WD patients, 29 were treated with zinc for a median of 12 years (range 3'25). Zinc was the initial treatment of choice in 12 cases. Normalization of serum ALT was the main parameter of treatment efficacy in this study. Adherence to therapy was assessed on the basis of clinical history and serum and urine copper and zinc levels. Results: Of 17 (58%) children treated with first-line penicillamine, 4 (24%) normalized ALT within a median of 14 months (range 4 to 48) and commenced maintenance zinc therapy. The remaining 13 (76%) patients with sustained hyper-ALT while on penicillamine crossed over to zinc; nine of these (70%) normalized ALT to zinc within a median of 9.5 months (range 5 to 151). Eleven (92%) of the 12 patients who received zinc alone as first choice normalized ALT within a median of 14 months (range 2 to 46). The patient with persistent hyper-ALT on zinc showed poor adherence to therapy. According to the 24-hour urinary copper excretion (56 +/- 4 versus 37 +/- 2 mg) at the end of follow-up, the efficacy in terms of decoppering was comparable in 2 groups. Conclusion: Although penicillamine therapy is commonly used for the initial treatment of WM, the present study demonstrated that zinc monotherapy can be used as first-line therapy in WM children with isolated hypertransaminasemia at presentation.",,"Ranucci, G.;Di Dato, F.;Della Corte, C.;Vajro, P.;Iorio, R.",2011,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e318224e326,0,1,
1742,Morbus Wilson: Treatment with integrated traditional Chinese medicinal herbs and western medicine,"Aim: To analyze the outcomes of patients with Wilson's disease treated with simple Western medicines integrating traditional Chinese and Western medicine and orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT). Background: Wilson disease (WD) or hepatolenticular degeneration is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by an ATP7B gene mutation. Because WM is an inherited nervous system disorder that is curable, early diagnosis and early and lifelong treatment lead to better prognosis. The best treatment currently recommended for Wilson's disease is to combine traditional Chinese and Western medicine. See Wang XP, etc. Neurology in the People's Republic of China - an update. EurNeurol 2010;64:320-324. Methods: Over 10,000 WM patients were hospitalized by neurologists in China at four WM centers (Hefei, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Changsha), and about 100 WM patients were surgically treated by OLT. Results: The decision whether to go for transplantation is complex and more than a purely medical assessment, and even contradictions between the different WM centers arise, in particular differences between physicians and surgeons. As a rule, neurologically affected patients can improve within four years with drug therapy. It has been shown that over years and even decades, over 80% of the treated WM patients lead a largely normal life thanks to integrated medical treatment. Conclusions: Treatment integrating traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine: penicillamine and sodium dimercaptosuccinate have more significant effects on copper excretion and relatively more side effects. These properties make western medicine more applicable to moderate to severe patients. Although the effect of Gandou Decoction is not as good as that of penicillamine or sodium dimercaptosuccinate, these elements make traditional Chinese medicine particularly suitable for mild and moderate patients or for taking in combination with Western medicine. In addition, the TCM herbs contained in Gandou Decoct are usually rich in zinc. In this case, Gandou decoction can be taken with zinc preparation at the same time, since they can mutually enhance the effect on the excretion of copper. Therefore, before choosing the drug, we should learn about the decopping amount of each type of drug, and then choose drugs with the best effects and the least side effects.",,"Wang, X.

1743,Wilson's disease: A Canadian perspective on presentation and clinical outcomes in an adult outpatient setting,"Aim: To review the clinical experience of Wilson's disease followed by a Liver (LC) and Movement Disorders (MDC) clinic at a single center in Toronto, Canada. Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is rare in Western countries. Long-term follow-up care and experience are therefore rare. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with MDC diagnosis who attended an LC and MDC. Results: 48 patients were included based on the Leipzig criteria. Follow-up ranged from 0-26.8J in LC and 0-19.8J in MDC. Fourteen patients presented asymptomatic, 13 with hepatic symptoms, 15 with neurological symptoms, and 6 with dual hepatic/neurological symptoms. The median age at presentation was > 40 years for 12.5%. Initially, ceruloplasmin was low 94% of the time, while 24-hour urinary copper was high 95%. Neurological patients presented a median of 4 symptoms (tremor, dysarthria, and gait disturbances were the most common), while three patients developed neurological symptoms after diagnosis. Additional psychiatric symptoms were present in 26%. All neurological patients had KF rings. When MRI was performed, abnormalities were reported in all patients with neurologic symptoms, but were normal or asymptomatic in patients with hepatic-only symptoms. Abnormalities included basal ganglia (62%) and brainstem (50%) lesions, atrophy (50%), and white matter changes (51%). D-penicillamine (DP) was the most common initial therapy (48%), with zinc being the most common (65%) at the time of review. One patient had a successful liver transplant. Side effects were most evident in DP (41%). Neurological deterioration occurred in 11 subjects due to DP or noncompliance, but 9 showed recovery. With neurological presentation, 14/21 had improved at the time of review. Overall there was one death. Conclusions: WD remains a diverse disease with generally favorable outcomes for those who respond to initial therapy. However, evidence of compensated liver damage and structural brain damage is common and emphasizes the need for close monitoring and adherence to therapy by joint liver and movement disorder clinics.",,"Moores, A.;Hirschfield, G.;Lang, T.;Fox, S.

1744,Gait disturbance in a patient with Wilson's disease 18 years after disease onset,"Aim: To describe the gait abnormalities in a patient with clinical signs of Wilson's disease for 18 years. Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that leads to excessive accumulation of copper in and outside the liver. A wide range of neurological symptoms, including dystonia, parkinsonian symptoms, cerebellar and bulbar signs, are very common and can severely impact the patient's quality of life. Although gait abnormality is a fairly prominent neurological sign in Wilson's disease, the characteristics of gait abnormalities have not been described in detail in the literature. Methods: This 51-year-old male patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of 33 after suffering from severe arm and head tremors for 2 years, which severely impaired his ability to work. Irritable and aggressive behavior was present at the time of disease onset and worsened in the first few years after diagnosis. He reported a marked worsening of symptoms after switching treatment from D-penicillamine to zinc sulfate in the late 1990s. Although D-penicillamine was reintroduced, gait has remained impaired since that time and the patient has been bound to a walker to adequately overcome his gait impairment. Recent urinalysis showed that copper was effectively eliminated with D-penicillamine. Results: On neurological examination, the patient showed a complex gait disorder with features of severe (gait-specific) dystonia and gait apraxia or freezing of gait (FOG). As he walked sideways along the wall, he used a simple clue to improve his walking disability. Otherwise, no significant impairment of leg motility and no pronounced dystonia could be observed either sitting or lying down. Some frontal signs were positive in this patient, but pyramidal signs were absent. Conclusions: This is an illustrative case showing a distinct pattern of gait abnormalities with a combination of FOG and dystonia. While dystonia in patients with Wilson's disease is well known, FOG is uncommon and may reflect the involvement of various neuroanatomical structures beyond basal ganglia pathology.",,"Brugger, F.;Felbecker, A.;Haegele-Link, S.;Tettenborn, B.;Kaegi, G.",2011,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.23764,0,0,
1745,Pallidal surgery for dystonia in Wilson's disease,"Objective: Wilson's disease is a disease characterized by increased levels of copper in the liver and brain. Surgical intervention has been limited in Wilson's disease because most symptoms may resolve with medical therapy. However, certain symptoms, such as disabling tremors, are resistant to drug therapy and may require surgical intervention. Case Report: A 20-year-old patient with Wilson's disease since the age of four with jaundice. She was treated with penicillamine, trientine, and zinc at various intervals over the next nine years. At the age of thirteen her tremors worsened with difficulty writing. She was started on trihexyphenidyl, tetrabenazine, and injectable botulinum toxin, and her dose of penicillamine was increased. At the age of 15 she was admitted as an emergency with unresponsiveness, hypotension, papilledema, suspected hepatic encephalopathy. CSF showed lymphocytic pleocytosis, high protein levels, serum CSF viral serology was negative, serum mycoplasma IgM was positive. She was treated with intravenous aciclovir, azithromycin and pulsed methylprednisolone, dopa was added. The patient was unable to eat or swallow. She was bedridden and could not walk. [Video 1]. She was treated with a high dose of penicillamine, 3 g/day, for a period of two years. She made a partial recovery and had significant residual dystonia, akinesia and rigidity. She could not speak clearly and was confined to a wheelchair. Their bradykinesia partially responded to dopa replacement with worsening of oral dyskinesia. [Video 2] She underwent DBS globus pallidal internus electrode placement with IPG placement under general anesthesia. After surgery at serial follow-up, her tone has improved, mobility has improved, with minimal mobility assistance. She takes 1500 mg of penicillamine with zinc daily [Video 3]. Conclusions: This young girl with Wilson's disease had persistent dystonia, parkinsonism, mutism, resulting in significant disability despite appropriate medical management, and improved thereafter with deep brain stimulation (DBS), which has not been seen in dystonia due to Wilson's disease in the past was tried. There are only a few case reports in the literature on operations for Wilson's disease. The most common operation was thalamotomy for resistant tremor.",,"Sankhla, C.

1746,Outcome and management of 207 pregnancies in Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic copper storage disorder that leads to liver failure and neurological deterioration. Lifelong medical treatment is required to maintain copper homeostasis. Optimal treatment regimens in pregnant women are discussed in terms of miscarriage rate, teratogenicity, and therapeutic efficacy. Aim: The current study aimed to assess pregnancy outcomes in a retrospective multicenter cohort study. Patients and methods: A total of 207 pregnancies in 100 WM patients in European tertiary care centers were analyzed retrospectively. Medical therapies (D-penicillamine, trientine, zinc salts, or a combination of a chelating agent and zinc) were classified and records were reviewed for maternal hepatic or neurological deterioration during pregnancy. Pregnancy outcome and abortion rate were analyzed in relation to maternal treatment and clinical picture. Results: Deterioration of liver function values was evident in 10 cases and was of a similar magnitude among all treatments. Liver function was resolved in all cases after delivery. Neurological deterioration during pregnancy was rare and was observed in only 2 cases (one with zinc therapy, one with D-penicillamine therapy), but led to a permanent worsening of neurological symptoms. The overall abortion rate in the study group was 48/207 (23.2%). Of these, 46 abortions were registered within the first three months; two stillbirths were associated with placental insufficiency. The abortion rate with Trientine treatment (8/20; 40%; p=0.04) was higher than with D-penicillamine (14/96; 14.7%) or zinc (2/19; 10.5%). We observed congenital defects in 2/159 newborns: one infant presented with partial esophageal atresia (on maternal D-penicillamine therapy), another infant was diagnosed with Glu-6-P-DH deficiency (on zinc therapy ). Conclusion: In most cases, liver function control was maintained during pregnancy, regardless of the medical treatment chosen. Neurological deterioration was rare but resulted in severe disability in two cases. Therefore, careful monitoring of WM patients during pregnancy is recommended. Contrary to previous reports, we observed a higher rate of miscarriages with Trientine treatment. Potential teratogenicity remains a problem, particularly with D-penicilamin therapy.",,"Weiss, K.

1747,An unexpected new antioxidant-like activity for the classic copper-chelating drug penicillamine,"Penicillamine (beta,beta'-dimethylcysteine) has been used extensively clinically as a copper chelating drug to treat copper overload in Wilson's disease. In this study, we found that penicillamine provides significant protection in human fibroblasts against cytotoxicity induced by tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ), a major toxic metabolite of the widely used wood preservative pentachlorophenol, while other classical copper chelators such as bathocuproine disulfonate do not. The auto-oxidation process of TCHQ yielding the reactive tetrachlorosemiquinone (TCSQ<sup>-</sup>) radical was studied using ESR and UV-Vis spectral methods. We unexpectedly found that the TCHQ autoxidation process and the time course of TCSQ<sup>-</sup> radical formation were remarkably retarded by penicillamine in a concentration-dependent manner. in contrast, no retarding effect on TCHQ autooxidation was observed with the classical copper chelating agent bathocuproine disulfonate. HPLC-MS and ESR studies showed that the TCSQ<sup>-</sup> radical was reduced by penicillamine to TCHQ, which was simultaneously oxidized to its corresponding disulfide form. These data suggest that the protective effect of penicillamine on TCHQ-induced cytotoxicity is not due to its copper binding but rather to its reduction of the reactive TCSQ<sup>-</sup> radical to the much less reactive TCHQ. This is the first report showing unexpected, novel antioxidant activity for this copper-chelating aminothiol drug, which may prove highly relevant to penicillamine's biological activities.",,"Zhu, B.

1748,Triple liver transplantation for recurrent autoimmune hepatitis initially disguised as fulminant Wilson's disease,"In 2006, a 15-year-old patient presented with symptoms of decompensated acute liver failure requiring admission for liver transplantation (LTx). Further laboratory tests indicated Wilson's disease, as the serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were significantly reduced and copper excretion increased sharply after ingestion of penicillamine. Genetic analysis confirmed a composite heterozygosity for Wilson's disease with two heterozygous mutations in exons 14 and 20, respectively, of the ATP7B gene. Post-LTx histology appeared to further confirm Wilson's diagnosis and was consistent with a decompensated course of Wilson's disease resulting in liver cirrhosis. Over the ensuing 28 months, she developed numerous acute rejection episodes that were responsive to high-dose steroids but recurred despite high-dose CNI and mTOR-based immunosuppressive therapies, eventually leading to chronic allograft failure that required relisting on the LTx . After re-LTx, her clinical course was again characterized by recurrent rejection episodes resistant to conventional treatment regimens, which in turn led to allograft failure with cirrhosis and the need for re-re-LTx by living donation from her mother 21 months after the second LTx. Prior to the third LTx, she was preconditioned by plasmapheresis and rituximab to prevent re-failure of the allograft due to potential antibody-mediated damage. Despite this and maximal immunosuppression including alemtuzumab, photopheresis and plasmapheresis after re-LTx, our patient again developed recurrent rejection episodes and signs of early onset allograft failure and cirrhosis. Throughout their clinical course, histologies of representative liver biopsies repeatedly showed cellular rejection infiltrates combined with evidence of interface hepatitis, cholangitis, lymphoplasmic infiltrates and progressive fibrosis. A careful re-evaluation of her case revealed that Wilson's diagnosis was not entirely correct, but that the culprit was recurrent LKM-positive autoimmune hepatitis, originally cloaked by Wilson's disease. Our patient was then administered steroids and azathioprine, the results of which have yet to be determined.",,"Kroemer, A.;Doenecke, A.;Schnitzbauer, A.;Kirchner, G.;Farkas, S.;Loss, M.;Geissler, E.

1749,Ten Chinese pediatric patients with Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson disease (WD, MIM #277900) is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in systemic copper accumulation and multiorgan damage. In pediatric patients, hepatic manifestations predominate. Untreated WD causes progressive liver and neurological deterioration. Early treatment is the most effective way to prevent these serious consequences. AIM & METHODS: We presented our experience of treating 10 pediatric WM patients. Data on clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, ultrasound findings, liver biopsies, genetic studies, treatment and outcome were reviewed. Results: Our patients were between 2 and 18 years old at the time of diagnosis. 1 patient presented with liver failure. Liver dysfunction was incidentally detected in 7 patients. 2 were diagnosed by sibling screening. The most consistent liver dysfunction was elevated alanine transaminase ranging from 60 to 419 IU/L (<58). Ceruloplasmin levels were all < 0.1 g/L (0.21-0.59). The mean urinary copper excretion was 4 µmol/day (< 1.0). 1 patient was initially treated with penicillamine and another with trientine. Zinc therapy was started in 7 patients. All stayed well with the follow-up. Conclusion: Our patients represented a group of asymptomatic WM patients who were diagnosed and treated very early. With good adherence to therapy, a favorable outcome can be expected. One way to diagnose these pre-symptomatic patients is to track abnormal liver functions.",,"Hui, J.;Chiang, G. P. K.;Yuen, Y.

1750,Hypersomnia in Wilson's disease,"Background and significance: Wilson's disease (WD) shows a large heterogeneity of the symptoms. In this case report we present hypersomnia as an unusual symptom in an unusual case of WD. Case: A 48-year-old woman was hospitalized for 2 years because of cognitive impairment. Her complaints such as tiredness, lack of concentration and depression began 3 years ago. There was no family history of psychiatric or other neurological disorders. No abnormality was found on neurological examination. A moderate increase in liver function tests was noted, but viral hepatitis markers were negative. The diagnosis of WD was based on decreased ceruloplasmin levels, increased urinary copper excretion, and decreased serum copper levels. The Kayser-Fleischer ring was not detectable. Brain MRI revealed increased T1 signaling lesions in both globus pallidus. Electroencephalography showed diffuse bilateral hemisphere slow waves with no epileptiform discharge. Liver biopsy showed the presence of nuclear glycogen, a cytoplasmic brownish pigment in hepatocytes and a minimal degree of periportal fibrosis. 8-10 months after starting D-penicillamine therapy, her symptoms gradually disappeared. A year after the breakup, she became more sleepy and hypersomnolent. She spent more than 2/3 of the day sleeping. After administration of methylphenidate 20 mg, she became almost awake and gradually improved with her negativity. Conclusions or comments: Hypersomnia was the main symptom in this patient. Although neurological presentations of WM without Kayser-Fleischer rings have been reported, the absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and the unusual clinical symptom indicate that this patient is a very exceptional WM patient.",,"Kim, S.",2011,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000327701,0,0,
1751,Wilson's disease with episodic hypersomnia,"Case: A 48-year-old woman was hospitalized for 2 years because of variable cognitive impairment. Her complaints such as tiredness, lack of concentration and depression began 3 years ago. She developed behavioral changes, emotional lability, restlessness and restlessness. There was no specific family history. No abnormalities were noted on physical and neurological examination. A moderate increase in liver function tests was noted, but all hepatitis viral markers and VDRL were negative. Neither toxic nor infectious diseases were detectable. The initial diagnosis of WD was based on decreased ceruloplasmin levels, increased urinary copper excretion, and decreased serum copper. Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring was not detected. Brain MRI showed increased T1 signal in both globus pallidus. The EEG showed diffuse slow waves with no epileptiform discharge. A liver biopsy was performed 3 years after onset of symptoms and showed the presence of nuclear glycogen with cytoplasmic brownish pigment in hepatocytes and a minimal degree of periportal fibrosis, but no evidence of hepatitis or other liver disease was detectable. EM changes included mitochondrial swelling and crista defragmentation. No evidence of hepatic encephalopathy was found. The blood ammonia level was normal. 8-10 months after starting D-penicillamine therapy, her symptoms gradually disappeared. In a year since the breakup, she became episodically more sleepy and hypersomnolent. During these attacks she spent more than 2/3 of the day sleeping. After being administered methylphenidate, she became awake and gradually improved with negativity.

1752,IPS technology and its implications for gene and cell therapy,"The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells by exogenous factors opens a new era of possibilities for regenerative medicine. Once safety concerns are addressed, potentially differentiated lineages derived from patient-specific iPSCs could be used for transplantation purposes, and this would change the way we perceive medicine today. However, in patients with genetic diseases, the mutation must be corrected, otherwise the functional defect will persist. The same applies to other acquired diseases in which viruses can enter cells via a specific receptor, for example AIDS. To solve these problems, there is growing interest in applying zinc finger technology to either correct mutations or turn off genes. But this technology has limitations and is lengthy. In this regard, gene therapy of iPSCs or their differentiated progeny using clinically approved vectors could represent a valuable opportunity. Here we have described the generation of iPSCs from a Chinese patient with Wilson's disease carrying the Chinese hotspot mutation R778L in the ATP7B gene, the product of which is a liver enzyme responsible for copper export into bile and blood. These iPSCs were pluripotent and could be easily differentiated into functional hepatocytes displaying abnormal cytoplasmic localization of mutated ATP7B and defective copper transport. Importantly, gene correction with a self-inactivating lentiviral vector expressing codon-optimized ATP7B could reverse the functional defect. In the future, hepatocytes from similarly genetically corrected iPSCs could also be an option for autologous transplantation in Wilson's disease. In particular, we also provide proof-of-principle that our experimental model based on iPSCs can be used to screen compounds aimed at correcting the anomaly.",,"Pei, D.",2011,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/mt.2011.85,0,0,
1753,Zinc therapy for neurological Wilson disease during pregnancy: case report and review of the literature,"Aim: To report our experience of managing zinc therapy during pregnancy in a patient with neurological Wilson's disease, in parallel with a review of the literature on the subject. METHODS: We treated a patient with neurological Wilson's disease with reduced doses of zinc during pregnancy because she could hardly keep to a full dose in this condition. The patient underwent bi-monthly clinical and laboratory evaluations throughout pregnancy, including a comprehensive assessment of copper balance. Results: Urinary copper excretion and serum zinc levels were below the proposed effective therapeutic ranges for all determinations. However, serum free copper levels were always within therapeutic ranges and both liver and neurological functions were fairly stable throughout the course of pregnancy, confirming good compliance with the reduced regimen and supporting its efficacy. Fetal development, which was regularly monitored by ultrasound, was normal and the patient eventually gave birth to a term, healthy baby. Conclusions: Consistent with the literature, we confirm that zinc therapy during pregnancy is safe and effective. Furthermore, our data provide further evidence that serum ""free copper"" levels would be more sensitive than urinary copper excretion to monitor compliance with zinc therapy and assess the efficacy of such treatment.",,"Bianchi, M.

This gene encodes an ATPase protein responsible for billiard copper excretion. This leads to copper accumulation in the liver and later in other organs such as the brain. Since the first reports in the 1990s, more than 400 mutations have been identified in different populations around the world. Neurological manifestations that appear in the second or third decade of life are the first manifestation in about half of the patients and can be highly variable. The majority of cases have a neurological clinical picture with various combinations of dysarthria, tremor, gait disturbances, dystonia and parkinsonism. The diagnosis of WM can be suspected in all patients with a chronic progressive movement disorder of unknown etiology, mainly when onset is in the second or third decades of life. Accurate, prompt diagnosis of individuals with WD is important because early treatment halts disease progression and can reverse established liver and brain damage to some degree. The Diagnosis The first step in diagnosing WM is a reasonable clinical suspicion. No single test is definitive and there is no universally accepted biochemical ""gold standard"". The diagnosis is based on the clinical picture and the combination of the results of several tests. The main diagnostic procedures in WM are: slit-lamp examination, serum ceruloplasmin levels, urinary copper excretion (UCE), penicillamine challenge UCE, hepatic copper concentration, MR imaging, and genetic testing to detect ATP7B gene mutations. In this presentation, diagnostic criteria for Wilson's disease are discussed. The aim of the pharmacological treatment of Wilson's disease is to restore the copper balance. The main drugs used are chelating agents such as D-penicillamine and trientine or zinc salts to limit the gastrointestinal absorption of copper. Orthotopic liver transplantation is indicated for patients with fulminant hepatic failure and for patients with chronic, severe hepatic insufficiency who are unresponsive to pharmacological therapy.",,"Barbosa, E.

1755,Efficacy and safety of D-penicillamine and trientine for treatment of Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic copper storage disorder that leads to liver failure and neurological deterioration. Current guidelines favor the use of chelating agents (dpenicillamine, trientine) in the first-line therapy of symptomatic patients, but optimal treatment regimens have yet to be established. Clinical data on larger cohorts comparing these chelating agents is limited. Aim: The current study aimed to evaluate the long-term results of D-penicillamine and trientine in a retrospective multicenter cohort study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 350 WM patients in European tertiary care centers and patients contributed by the EUROWILSON database research group were analyzed retrospectively. Chelation-based therapies were analyzed for efficacy, side effects, and reasons for discontinuation using Kaplan-Meier estimation. Treatments lasting less than 6 months were censored. Results: Hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms were present in 221 (63.1%) and 119 (34%) patients, respectively. The patients were initially treated with D-penicillamine (n = 309) or trientine (n = 41). Medication switching was frequent in both groups, resulting in a total of 514 treatments analyzed (d-penicillamine n=350, trientine n=164). Actuarial survival without transplantation (median follow-up: 16.5 years) was similar (death: d-penicillamine n=7/350, trientine n=3/164; progression to liver transplantation: d-penicillamine 12/350, trientine 2 / 164). In the d-penicillamine group, adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were more common (p=0.045) and persisted even after decades of therapy. At the latest available time point of 48 months of follow-up, liver deterioration occurred in only 8/514 treatments (d-penicillamine n=3, trientine n=5, p=ns). However, neurologic deterioration was less common in the d-penicillamine group (7/350 treatments) compared to trientine (12/164, p=0.005), while improvement was seen to a similar extent in symptomatic neurologic patients (d-penicillamine 84/139; trientine 42/79, p=ns). Interestingly, improvement in liver function in symptomatic patients was observed more frequently with D-penicillamine (211/235) than with trientine (64/86, p<0.05). Conclusion: In the majority of patients, chelation therapy was effective and resulted in comparable and favorable actuarial survival without transplantation. The main limitation of treatment with D-penicillamine was the higher rate of adverse events. Neurological deterioration with chelation therapy was rare and, contrary to our expectation, more common in patients treated with trientine.",,"Weiss, K. H.;Schots, M.;Gotthardt, D.

1756,Wilson's disease with co-existing autoimmune hepatitis. A case report,"Wilson's disease [WD] - an inherited disorder of copper metabolism in individuals with mutated ATP7B genes, occurs in every ethnic and geographic population, with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 30 million. WD can present clinically as liver disease, a progressive neurological disorder, or as a psychiatric illness. The spectrum of liver disease present in patients with WD can be very diverse, ranging from asymptomatic with only biochemical abnormalities to acute liver failure. Because de novo genetic diagnosis is currently expensive and not widely available, a combination of clinical findings and biochemical testing is usually required to diagnose WM. We describe a 19-year-old woman who presented with classic features of WD and multiple features of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The patient was initially diagnosed with AIH and was treated with standard corticosteroid therapy [prednisolone 60 mg daily], resulting in initial clinical improvement but subsequent deterioration. The diagnosis of WD was made 4 months after the initial diagnosis of AIH. Subsequent diagnosis of WD and introduction of penicillamine [1 g daily] gave excellent improvement and normalization of liver function tests. We assume that in this case simultaneous WD and AIH cannot be ruled out. Therefore, thorough screening for WD is required in patients with AIH, particularly when the response to steroid therapy is poor. Conversely, in patients suffering from WD with superimposed features of AIH, a combination of steroids and penicillamine may be beneficial.",,"Vashakidze, E.;Gegeshidze, T.;Buachidze, T.",2011,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12072-010-9241-z,0,0,

The genetic basis for excessive copper deposition in the liver and extrahepatic tissues, caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, has been identified. The classic description of cirrhosis, neurological manifestations, and Kayser-Fleischer rings is present in a minority of cases. The clinical features are age-dependent: liver disease predominates in children, while neurological manifestations typically appear in young adulthood. The spectrum of liver disease ranges from asymptomatic elevation of aminotransferases to acute liver failure. The clinical and hepatic histological features of Wilson disease may be indistinguishable from autoimmune hepatitis. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease is based on a combination of clinical manifestation and biochemical parameters (low serum ceruloplasmin, high copper excretion in 24-hour urine, high copper concentration in the liver). Molecular genetic testing is expensive and not widely available. Treatment for Wilson's disease includes chelating agents such as penicillamine or trientine, zinc, and dietary avoidance of foods high in copper.

1766,Review article: The current management of acute liver failure,"Aliment Pharmacol Ther 31, 345-358 Summary Background Acute hepatic failure is a devastating clinical syndrome with a persistently high mortality rate despite advances in critical care medicine. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a life-saving treatment in select cases, but effective use of this limited resource requires an accurate prognosis because of surgical risks and the need for subsequent lifelong immunosuppression. Aim To review the etiology of acute liver failure, discuss the evidence behind management strategies in critical care medicine, and explore possible treatment alternatives to OLT. Methods Literature research with Ovid, PubMed and current conference abstracts. Results Paracetamol remains the most common cause of acute liver failure in industrialized countries, whereas acute viral causes predominate elsewhere. Cerebral edema is one of the leading causes of death, and its prevention and prompt detection are important components of critical care, which aims to provide multi-organ support and “buy time” to perform either organ regeneration or psychological and physical evaluation prior to donor recruitment to allow organ. Artificial liver assist devices do not improve mortality in acute liver failure, while there is limited evidence base supporting their use for most other interventions. Conclusion Acute liver failure remains a truly challenging disease and requires early detection and referral of patients to specialized centers that provide intensive, multidisciplinary input and, in some cases, OLT. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Craig, D.

We performed a retrospective review of the medical notes of 16 of 96 (17%) children diagnosed with WM between 1981 and 2006. The children were 6.6 to 15 years old. Only three received trientine as initial therapy [parental choice (two), allergic reactions to penicillamine (one) during penicillamine challenge], 13 of 16 were switched from penicillamine to trientine due to reactions to penicillamine: hematuria in four, bone marrow suppression in three, neutropenia on three. Trientine was discontinued in three cases due to allergic rash, poor copper excretion and one with compliance problems requiring transplantation. 75% of children with chronic liver disease. Kayser-Fleischer rings were found in eight out of 16, Wilson Ferenci's value range was between 4 and 10 (nl < 4). The laboratory indices remained relatively stable. Consistent with previous reports, trientine has been used primarily as a second-line treatment when experiencing severe side effects from penicillamine.

1768,Copper complexing agents as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease,"The notion that copper dysfunction is involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is based on a number of observations from in vitro and clinical studies, as well as animal models. However, there is still considerable controversy as to whether an excess or deficiency of copper is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Numerous studies support the hypothesis that copper excess contributes to AD, but experimental evidence in transgenic mouse models appears to suggest the opposite, and at least one clinical study shows that cognitive decline is positively correlated with low copper levels. We have recently reported a deregulation of the ceruloplasmin-copper relationship specific to AD patients, consisting of an increase in the copper pool not bound to ceruloplasmin, ie 'free' copper. This phenomenon could provide an explanation for the conflicting results of clinical studies. Several clinical studies have been conducted in search of an anti-metal effect that counteracts the progression of AD. Some of them have provided encouraging results suggesting that ""metalloprotein-attenuating compounds"" may indeed positively alter disease progression.

1769,Matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors as markers of inflammation and fibrosis in chronic liver disease (Review),"Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide due to hemodynamic and metabolic complications of liver cirrhosis. During CLD, the extracellular matrix undergoes a remodeling process that leads to the formation and deposition of new collagen. Tissue remodeling is regulated by fine molecular mechanisms involving proteases, inhibitors and growth factors. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a class of zinc- and calcium-dependent enzymes, and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) play the major role in matrix degradation. Along with advances in diagnostic techniques leading to more precise and less invasive methods, the concept of surveillance has gained importance in the clinical management of CLD. According to current knowledge, liver biopsy still represents an indispensable procedure for staging liver disease. However, despite its importance, liver biopsy has some limitations: The risk of underestimating the disease is the most significant, since liver lesions are often located irregularly in the liver. In parallel with the limitations of liver biopsy, clinical needs for early detection of progressive fibrosis necessitate the development of additional non-invasive techniques. In this review, we discuss the main issues related to this important clinical need. In addition, we focus on the role of MMPs and TIMPs in the pathogenesis of CLD and their potential use as non-invasive serum markers of inflammation and fibrosis in this pathology.",,"Consolo, M.;Amoroso, A.;Spandidos, D.

1774,Wilson's disease. [Czech],"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder that causes accumulation of copper in tissues, primarily in the liver and brain. The genetic defect lies in the gene that encodes ATPase type P (ATP7B). Inheritance is autosomal recessive. To date, more than 500 mutations that cause Wilson's disease have been described. The most common mutation in Central Europe is the mutation H1069Q. The manifestation of Wilson disease is usually hepatic or neurological. The hepatic form is manifested by acute or chronic hepatitis, steatosis or cirrhosis. Neurological involvement usually manifests after the age of 20 with motor disturbances (tremor, speech disorders, writing disorders) that can develop into a severe extrapyramidal syndrome with tremor, rigidity, dysarria, dysfagia, and muscle contracture. Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory investigations (neurological symptoms, liver disease, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, elevated serum free copper concentration, high urinary copper excretion and presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings). Diagnosis is confirmed by hepatic copper concentration in liver biopsy or by genetic testing. An untreated disease leads to the death of a patient. Treatment is based on chelating agents that reduce copper levels through urinary excretion (D-penicillamine, trientine) or agents that prevent copper absorption from food (zinc, ammonium tetrathiomolybdenum). Patients with asymptomatic Wilson's disease also require treatment. In the Czech Republic, either penicillamine or zinc are used. Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with fulminant liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis. A screening in families of affected patients (all siblings) is obvious.",,"Bruha, R.;Marecek, Z.;Martasek, P.;Nevsimalova, S.;Petrtyl, J.;Urbanek, P.;Kalistova, H.;Pospisilova, L.",2009,,,0,0,

Methods Clinical character, changes in copper metabolism and therapeutic effects of 8 patients with late-stage Wilson's disease were analyzed. Ceruloplasmin levels were measured by nephelometry and copper levels in serum, urine and liver were measured by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. Initial treatment was sodium dimercaptosulfonate followed by D-penicillamine and/or zinc. Results Patients with late-onset Wilson's disease accounted for 7.0% of all patients presenting with early-stage liver disease symptoms such as anorexia or nausea and were easily misdiagnosed. Most patients with late-onset Wilson's disease had normal blood and aminotransferase levels, and all patients had Kayser-Fleisher rings. There was a significant difference between the liver function test and the copper metabolite test. The average urinary copper content on the first day after administration of sodium dimercaptosulfonate was 4,072 ml/24 h, which was 18.1 times that of pre-treatment and 2.5 times that of D-penicillamine. No obvious side effects were observed. The prognosis was mostly good. Conclusion Sufficient attention should be paid to late-onset Wilson's disease, which is not uncommon and easily misdiagnosed.

Hydrophilic chelating agents such as meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid are effective in promoting renal metal excretion, but their ability to reach intracellular metals is weak. Recently, newer strategies to overcome these disadvantages such as combination therapy (use of structurally different chelating agents) or co-administration of antioxidants have been reported.

1781,Diagnosis and management of acute liver failure,"Purpose of Review: Acute liver failure (ALF) is a devastating syndrome that affects previously healthy individuals. Early detection of the disease is crucial, as aggressive treatment can improve outcomes. However, despite significant advances in care, mortality remains high (30-100%). This brief overview focuses on the causes and general management of the complications of ALF. Recent Findings: Our knowledge of the causes of ALF has increased significantly over the past decade. The mechanism of hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema in this situation is further elucidated and discussed here.

1783,Clinical application of liver MR imaging in Wilson's disease,"Aim: To determine whether there is a correlation between liver MR findings and the clinical manifestations and severity of liver dysfunction in patients with Wilson's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two radiologists retrospectively evaluated MR images of the liver of 50 patients with Wilson's disease. The Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective study and informed consent was waived. MR images were evaluated with a focus on hepatic contour abnormalities and the presence of intrahepatic nodules. Using Fisher's exact test, MR findings were compared to clinical presentations (neurological and non-neurological) and hepatic dysfunction categorized by the Child-Pugh classification system (A, B, and C). Follow-up MRI images were available for 17 patients. Results: Liver contour abnormalities and intrahepatic nodules were observed in 31 patients (62%) and 25 patients (50%), respectively. Each MR finding showed a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) between the three groups of the Child-Pugh classification (A, n=36; B, n=5; C, n=9), with the exception of splenomegaly (p=0.243) . The mean age of the MRI positive patients was older than that of the MRI negative patients. In patients with Child-Pugh class A (n = 36) with neurological presentation, intrahepatic nodules, surface nodules, and dilatation of the gallbladder fossa were more common. Intrahepatic nodules were improved (n=8, 47%), stationary (n=5, 29%), or worsened (n=4, 24%) on follow-up MRI images. Conclusion: MR imaging demonstrates liver contour abnormalities and parenchymal nodules in more than half of patients with Wilson disease, which correlates with the severity of liver dysfunction and clinical manifestations.",,"Cheon, J.

Zinc-deficient patients have severe dysfunction that mainly affects T-helper cells. Severe zinc deficiency is characterized by skin lesions. growth retardation, impaired wound healing, anemia and mental retardation. Fortunately, all symptoms can be reversed with zinc treatment. Zinc reduces oxidative stress markers and the formation of inflammatory cytokines. Zinc also plays an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD). Multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Wilson's disease (WD). It is also involved in signal transduction and apoptosis, ie zinc prevents the growth of prostate cells through its apoptosis induction. Many transcription factors contain zinc fingers and similar structural motifs. Zinc finger motifs bind to a variety of compounds, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules.

1787,Hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease. [German],"Hereditary hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease are both autosomal recessive metabolic diseases that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver. Hereditary hemochromatosis is characterized by iron overload due to increased duodenal iron absorption, while copper overload in Wilson's disease results from impaired biliary copper excretion. In hemochromatosis in particular, but also in Wilson's disease, the last decade has seen extraordinary growth in our understanding of the pathophysiology of both diseases. Hepatic and extrahepatic symptoms can occur in hemochromatosis. Extrahepatic symptoms include cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, and endocrine dysfunction. Hepatic and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms are typical in Wilson's disease. While genetic testing for a homozygous HFE-C282Y mutation (or a composite heterozygous C282Y/H63D mutation) is very helpful in hemochromatosis, genetic analysis of the Wilson gene, ATP7B, is limited by the presence of a large number of individual mutations. Hemochromatosis is effectively treated with phlebotomies, while Wilson's disease is treated medically with chelators (D-penicillamine and triethylenetetramine) or zinc salts. Liver transplantation is a therapeutic option for both diseases and shows excellent long-term results in Wilson's disease but less favorable results in hemochromatosis. The prognosis of an adequately treated disease is very good for both diseases, especially if the diagnosis is made early in the course of the disease. © 2009 Springer Medizin Verlag.",,"Merle, U.;Weiss, K.

1788,The Role of Garlic in Hepatopulmonary Syndrome: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Increased nitric oxide production in cirrhosis has been commonly associated with the development of hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). Initial studies suggested that garlic, a part of the daily diet, may play a role in treating HPS by altering nitric oxide production. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of oral garlic supplementation on arterial blood gas parameters and overall morbidity and mortality in patients with HPS. METHODS: Twenty-one and 20 HPS patients were randomly assigned to either oral garlic supplementation or placebo and followed monthly for nine to 18 months. RESULTS: At nine months, garlic supplementation was associated with a 24.66 percent increase in baseline arterial oxygen levels (83.05 mmHg vs. 66.62 mmHg; P<0.001), compared with an increase of only 7.37 percent (68.75 mmHg versus 64.05 mmHg; P=0.02). among subjects in the placebo group. There was also a 28.35 percent decrease in the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (21.35 mmHg versus 29.77 mmHg; P<0.001) in patients with HPS who received garlic, as opposed to a decrease of just 10.73% (29.11 mmHg versus 32.61 mmHg; P=0.12). ) among those in the placebo group. At nine months, arterial oxygen content was significantly higher (83.05 mmHg versus 68.75 mmHg; P<0.001) and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was significantly lower (21.35 mmHg versus 29.11 mmHg; P<0.001) in patients who received garlic compared to those receiving placebo. HPS reversal was observed in 14 of 21 patients (66.67%) on garlic supplementation (intent-to-treat analysis) and in 1 of 20 patients (5%) on placebo. Two of 21 patients who underwent garlic supplementation died during follow-up, in contrast to seven of 20 patients who received placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary supplementation with garlic may be beneficial in patients with HPS for reversing intrapulmonary shunts and reducing hypoxemia and mortality. Â©2010 Pulsus Group Inc.

1789,Current status of patients with Wilson's disease in central Japan,"Aim This study evaluated the current status of patients with Wilson's disease in central Japan. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 1999 and 2007, 30 patients were diagnosed with Wilson's disease with an International Diagnostic Score of 4 or more. The phenotypes, genotypes and post-diagnostic courses of these patients were analyzed. Results Twenty-six patients had ATP7B mutations responsible for Wilson's disease. Four patients had a single mutated chromosome. There were 2 major mutations of 2333 G>T and 2871 delC (40%) and 6 new mutations (13%) in our patients. The first clinical manifestation was the hepatic form in 22, the neurological form in 5 and hemolysis in 3 patients. The hepatic form was diagnosed around the age of 13, followed by neurological complications with a delay of 9 years. Therefore, some patients, particularly those with the neurological form, did not undergo early diagnostic testing, including ATP7B analysis. During the period after diagnosis, 3 patients were hospitalized for recurrent liver disease and 2 patients committed suicide. One patient died of acute hepatic failure associated with encephalopathy after fertilization therapy, while two male patients recovered from encephalopathy-free persistent hepatic failure after noncompliance with drug therapy. The King's scores for liver transplantation were below the cut-off in both cases. Conclusion In order to minimize the delay in diagnosis, a ceruloplasmin determination and an ATP7B analysis can be recommended for patients with liver damage of unknown etiology. With gene diagnosis, appropriate patient management, including compliance training and emotional support, could be important to prevent suicide. 2010 The Japan Society for Internal Medicine.

1792,Electroencephalography in the stable therapy phase of Wilson's disease. [German],"Introduction: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. In addition to hepatic and extrapyramidal motor clinical symptoms, patients with Wilson's disease also present with subclinical disturbances of other central neural pathways. Reports of abnormalities found in EEG recordings are conflicting and rare. METHODS: In this study, electroencephalography was performed in 49 patients with Wilson's disease (32 patients with neurological form, 17 patients with non-neurological form) undergoing long-term drug therapy. Attention was paid to general slowing, focal abnormalities, and epileptiform activity. The EEG results were correlated with the clinical manifestations using a neurological score established for Wilson's disease. Results: The EEG recordings showed unremarkable results in almost 80% of all examined patients with a long-term progression. Mild continuous slow activity occurred in six patients and intermittent rhythmic delta activity was observed in two patients with the neurological form of Wilson's disease. A difference in median alpha rhythm rate between the neurological and non-neurological forms (9.27/s and 9.63/s, respectively) was insignificant. Epileptiform activity was detected in only one patient with incidental epilepsy. Conclusions: Patients with Wilson's disease show normalized electroencephalographic traces during the course of the disease. Abnormal changes appear to be due to either additional disorders or secondary complications. Electroencephalography has proven to be helpful, especially in the course of diagnosis. © 2010 Georg Thieme Verlag KG.",,"Gunther, P.;Baum, P.;Villmann, T.;Hermann, W.",2010,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-1253441,0,0,

[Portuguese, English]","Objective: Description of clinical symptoms, laboratory findings in the diagnosis and treatment of children and adolescents with Wilson's disease. Methods: This is a descriptive and retrospective study of a series of 17 children and adolescents with Wilson's disease attended from 1985 to 2008 at the Pediatric Hepatology Outpatient Unit of the Hospital das Clinicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Brazil. Data were collected from revision of medical records and during clinical follow-up. Results: The patients were 2.8 to 15.1 years old, with a mean age of 8.8 +/- 0.9 years. The main symptomatology of the disease was hepatic (53%), followed by the asymptomatic form, diagnosed by family screening. The Kayser-Fleischer ring was observed in 41% of patients. Ceruloplasmin was altered in 15 of 17 patients, and urinary copper fluctuated between 24 and 1000 µg/24 h (median: 184 µg/24 h). Treatment was established in all cases with D-penicillamine. Mild side effects were observed in five children without the need to interrupt or change medication. Clinical and laboratory response to treatment with normalization of aminotransferase levels was demonstrated in 14 patients after a median of 10.7 months. Despite treatment, three patients died (one from fulminant hepatitis and two from severe liver failure). Conclusions: Wilson's disease is rare in the pediatric group. In children, the main presentation is liver disease. The diagnosis can be made by reduced ceruloplasmin levels and increased copper excretion in the 24-hour urine, but requires high suspicion. There is good tolerability and response to medical treatment.",,"Socio, S. D. A.;Ferreira, A. R.;Fagundes, E. D. T.;Roquete, M. L. V.;Pimenta, J. R.;Campos, L. D. F.;Penna, F. J.",2010,June,,0,0,
1794,The current status and recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an inherited, autosomal recessive copper accumulation and toxicity disorder affecting approximately 30 people per million. This rare disease is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, which is important for copper excretion in the bile and leads to copper accumulation in the liver. Toxic levels of copper can also be found in the brain and kidneys, and clinical phenotypes include hepatic, hemolytic, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. The diagnosis is based on the combination of clinical features and findings such as increased urinary copper excretion, decreased serum ceruloplasmin levels, high copper concentrations in liver tissue and Kayser-Fleischer rings, biochemical and immunological markers, neuropathological examination with magnetic resonance imaging. Genetic studies are also becoming available for clinical use, but the utility of direct mutation analysis is limited.",,"Kiranmayi, G. V.

1795,Wilson's Disease: Current Concepts in Diagnosis and Management. [Croatian],"Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive copper transport disorder that results in copper accumulation in the liver, brain, and cornea. Incidence is estimated at 1 in 30,000–80,000 in most populations. The Wilson disease gene, now referred to as ATP7B, located on the 13th chromosome (13q14.3), was cloned in 1993. The clinical phenotypes include hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric disorders, or a combination thereof. A combination of clinical features, various laboratory parameters and Kayser-Fleischer rings is required to make the diagnosis. Mutation analysis can provide a definitive diagnosis and becomes part of the diagnostic algorithm, especially in patients with undetermined clinical and biochemical features. Family screening should be performed for first-degree relatives. Detecting the disease at an early stage is crucial, as treatment prevents severe liver damage and/or lifelong neurological disability. The goal of treatment is to decrease the tissue concentration of copper, either by improving urinary excretion or by decreasing absorption in the gut. Treatment includes copper chelators, such as penicillamine and trientine, and zinc salts. Liver transplantation is a treatment option for acute liver failure or treatment-resistant and severe advanced liver disease. It is not indicated in patients with primarily neuropsychiatric symptoms.",,"Kalauz, M.;Telarovic, S.;Ljubic, H.",2010,,,0,0,

The HFE gene encodes a protein that is closely involved in intestinal iron absorption. Aims: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the HFE gene mutation, its role in iron metabolism in patients with Wilson's disease, and the interaction of therapy in copper and iron homeostasis. METHODS: The records of 32 patients with Wilson's disease were reviewed for iron and copper indices, HFE gene mutations, and liver biopsy. Results: Twenty-six patients were negative for HFE gene mutations and showed no significant changes in iron metabolism. The HFE mutation was significantly associated with increased hepatic iron content (P<0.02) and a transferrin saturation index (P<0.03). After the treatment period, the iron indices were significantly reduced only in the wild-type HFE gene. Conclusions: The HFE gene mutations may be an addictive factor in iron overload in Wilson's disease. Our results showed that drug dose adjustment could prevent further overtreatment-induced iron overload only in patients with HFE wild-type. © 2009.",,"Sorbello, O.;Sini, M.;Civolani, A.;Demelia, L.",2010,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2009.06.012,0,0,
1798,Risks of copper and iron toxicity during aging in humans,"Copper and iron are essential but also toxic metals. Their essentiality is known, but their toxicity, with the exception of the genetic overload diseases Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis, is not as well known. Nevertheless, their toxicities in the population are so common that they pose a looming public health problem in geriatric diseases and in the aging process itself. Both metals are transition elements, and their resulting redox properties have been exploited during evolution to develop oxidative energy production. But both contribute to the production of excess harmful oxidative radicals. Evolution has kept a surplus of copper and iron during the reproductive years because they are so essential to life. But the oxidative damage from these excess metal stores builds up with age, and natural selection stops working after about 50 years because disease no longer contributes to reproductive capacity after that. Age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's, other neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and others can all be caused by excess copper and iron. A very disturbing study has found that in the general population, those in the highest one-fifth of copper intakes, when also consuming a relatively high-fat diet, lose cognition at more than three times the normal rate. Inorganic copper in drinking water and food supplements is treated differently than food grade copper and is therefore more toxic. Trace amounts of copper in drinking water, less than a tenth of those permitted by the Environmental Protection Agency for human drinking water, significantly increased Alzheimer's-like disease in an animal model. In the final part of this review, I will provide advice on how to reduce the risks from copper and iron toxicity. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Brewer, G.

The role of Fe and Cu, their pathogenesis mechanisms and possible therapeutic relevance are discussed with regard to four of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Metal-mediated oxidation by Fenton chemistry is a common feature of all these disorders and is part of a self-reinforcing mechanism of damage leading to neurodegeneration. The interaction between metals and proteins in the nervous system appears to be a crucial factor in the development or absence of neurodegeneration. The present review also addresses the tested therapeutic strategies, mainly using metal chelators. The metal accumulation observed in these diseases within the nervous system could be the result of compensatory mechanisms to improve metal availability for physiological processes. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",,"Rivera-Mancia, S.;Perez-Neri, I.;Rios, C.;Tristan-Lopez, L.;Rivera-Espinosa, L.;Montes, S.",2010,July,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2010.04.010,0,0,

1811,Investigative approaches to therapies in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"Discipline Importance: In fibrosing diseases, scar tissue begins to replace normal tissue, resulting in tissue dysfunction. For example, in the case of pulmonary fibrosis, scar-like foci form in the lungs, which impair the patient's breathing. These conditions represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality. More than 150,000 people in the US have some form of fibrotic lung disease and the 5-year mortality rate for these diseases can be as high as 80%. Despite this large unmet medical need, there are no FDA-approved therapies. Although our understanding of the causes and biology of fibrosing diseases remains relatively poor, we have made impressive progress in identifying the key cell populations and many biochemical mediators that can drive this process. As a result, novel therapeutics are being developed based on these discoveries. Areas covered in this review: This review examines the experimental therapies currently being studied (as of late 2009) for a major class of pulmonary fibrosis termed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). What the reader will gain: The reader is provided with an overview of current experimental therapies for IPF. Take-home message: With the recent approval of pirfenidone in Japan for use in IPF and a rich pipeline of experimental therapies in various stages of clinical development, the future looks bright for new treatment options. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.",,"Gomer, R.

1812,Influence of copper on early development: prenatal and postnatal considerations,"Copper (Cu) is an essential nutrient whose requirements are increased during pregnancy and lactation. These are times of critical growth and development, and the fetus and newborn are particularly vulnerable to deficiencies in this nutrient. Genetic mutations that predispose offspring to deficient Cu stores can be life-threatening, as seen in children with Menkes disease. Severe Cu deficiency, once considered a rare condition, has been increasingly reported in the literature over the past decade. Secondary Cu deficiency can be caused in a number of ways, e.g. B. from excessive zinc or iron intake, certain medications and bariatric surgery. Preterm and low birth weight infants can be born with low Cu inventories. A number of mechanisms may contribute to Cu teratogenicity, including decreased activity of selected cuproenzymes, increased oxidative stress, decreased nitric oxide availability, altered iron metabolism, abnormal extracellular matrix protein cross-linking, decreased angiogenesis, and altered cell signaling, among others. The brain, heart, and vascular system, as well as tissues such as the lungs, skin, and hair, and systems including the skeletal, immune, and blood systems are adversely affected by suboptimal Cu during development. In addition, persistent structural, biochemical, and functional side effects are noted in the offspring even when Cu supplementation is started after birth, supporting the concept that adequate Cu nutrition during pregnancy and lactation is critical for normal development. Although Cu-containing IUDs are an effective method of increasing intrauterine Cu concentration and reducing the risk of pregnancy, it is believed that high dietary Cu levels do not pose a direct developmental risk. © 2010 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Uriu-Adams, J.

Targeted risk screening and early intervention for elevated BLLs, as currently recommended by the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics, should be performed by every primary care physician to minimize the harmful effects of lead in children.",,"Chandran, L.;Cataldo, R.",2010,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/pir.31-10-399,0,0,
1814,ATP7B gene mutations in two Thai siblings with Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. Aim: To report the clinical data and mutational analysis of two Thai siblings with suspected WD. Subject and Methods: A 13-year-old boy presenting with cirrhosis, arthralgia, hypoalbuminemia, and coagulopathy and his 11-year-old sister, who was asymptomatic but had hepatomegaly with transaminase elevations, were examined. ATP7B gene mutation analysis and mRNA analysis were performed on both patients and their parents. Results: Investigations were consistent with WM and their liver disease improved after standard treatment for WM. DNA analyzes in these two patients revealed two new mutations, namely a deletion of the first 2 bp of exon 6 (c.1870-1871delGA) and a single A to G base substitution at nucleotide 4075 (c.4075A>G) in the exon 20 (p.M1359V). PCR restriction digestion with the restriction enzyme NcoI was used as a second method to confirm the c.4075A>G mutation and to rapidly screen in 100 chromosomes from unrelated healthy controls, and this variant was not present in the controls. The c.1870-1871delGA deletion caused a frameshift effect resulting in a premature stop codon (p.E624fsX753), and the p.M1359V mutation is a valine-to-methionine substitution, affecting its orientation and interaction with others may have adjacent amino acids. Conclusion: Two new mutations of the ATP7B gene were identified in two Thai siblings with WD.",,"Treepongkaruna, S.;Pienvichit, P.;Phuapradit, P.;Kodcharin, P.;Wattanasirichaigoon, D.",2010,February,,0,0,

1816,Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene. Absence or reduced function of the ATP7B protein leads to decreased hepatocellular excretion of copper into the bile. The subsequent accumulation of copper, initially in the liver but eventually in the brain and other tissues, leads to various clinical manifestations such as hepatic, neurological, haematological, ophthalmological and psychiatric problems. The diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, parameters of copper metabolism, eye examination (Kayser-Fleischer rings) and a liver biopsy. Genetic testing is of limited use. Early diagnosis and initiation of therapy with chelating agents and therapeutic plasma exchange therapy are crucial for the prognosis. Liver transplantation corrects the underlying pathophysiology and can be life-saving in fulminant liver failure.

1817,Morbus Wilson Evaluation of disease-related topics from the perspective of patients through patient-generated paintings A cooperation study with the German patient organization verein morbus wilson e. V. [German],"Background: The importance of disease-related topics can vary greatly between patients and physicians. Patient organizations such as the German association Morbus Wilson e. V. can overcome this discrepancy. The aim of the present collaborative study was to collect issues important to Wilson patients by asking the patients to create pictures about their illness. Methods: Patients with Morbus Wilson were asked by email to paint pictures about their illness and donate them to Morbus Wilson e. V. Results: 32 paintings from 27 patients were donated. The majority of patients added written comments to their artwork. The following disease-related topics were included in the images: psychological work-up of the disease 33% (n = 11), representation of affected organs (liver/brain) 22% (n = 6), therapy 19% (n = 5), diagnosis path 15% ( n=4), heredity 15% (n=4), copper-related diet 11% (n=3). 33% (n = 11) of the images consisted of two parts, reflecting before and after the disease or depicting the individual course of the disease. Conclusion: Psychological aspects of accepting illness are the prominent theme in the pictures. The time of diagnosis is experienced as a major change in life. The paintings allow both the patient organization and caregivers to focus more on the psychological aspects of the disease. Asking for paintings opens a new channel for patient-physician contacts and creates a sense of interest and competence in patients.",,"Schafer, M.;Weiss, K.

1818,Tin bells rang in Jerusalem!,"""Oh, Jerusalem of gold and of light and of bronze..."" is the popular song. But it was another metal that towered over the Jerusalem landscape during the meeting of the International Society for Zinc Biology (ISZB; http://www.iszb.org/) in Mishkenot Sha'ananim, a whisper from the Old City walls. More than 100 scientists met from December 1st to 5th, 2009 to discuss their research on the biology of this metal. Zinc is a double-edged sword. Zinc supplementation accelerates wound healing and growth and promotes an effective immune response. On the other hand, zinc deficiency leads to growth retardation and impaired learning and memory function, and has been linked to mood disorders. However, at the cellular level, an uncontrolled increase in zinc concentrations can lead to nerve cell death and possibly be involved in neurodegenerative diseases. By regulating various intracellular signaling pathways, zinc can accelerate cell growth and potentially contribute to cancer. However, despite the physiological and clinical importance of this metal, research into the molecular basis of these effects is still in its infancy. The 2009 ISZB meeting provided a place for researchers working on various zinc-related topics to share their thoughts and ideas and encourage the growth of this field.

[Japanese],"54-year-old woman with Wilson's disease was treated with D-penicillamine for 24 years. A hypervascular liver tumor was found in S6, which was then diagnosed as a hemangioma. Seventeen months later, the liver tumor increased in number and size. There were more than 4 tumors and the maximum size of the tumor was over 5 cm. Liver function was assessed as Child-Pugh grade A. These tumors were diagnosed as multiple HCC and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization was performed. Six weeks later, CT showed viable lesions and all tumors existed in S5-6. Neurological symptoms were stable and therefore all tumors were removed by liver resection (S5-6). Pathologic examination revealed cirrhosis of the liver and all tumors were moderately differentiated HCC. No copper deposition was observed on rhodamine staining. The postoperative course was good and both liver function and neurological symptoms have remained stable since then. No tumor has appeared during the 14 months after the operation.

1822,"Clinical features of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome in undiagnosed Wilson's disease: report of two cases","Introduction: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by toxic accumulation of copper mainly in the liver and brain. The hepatic manifestation of WD is diverse and may include asymptomatic aminotransferase elevation, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or acute/fulminant hepatic failure. Acute liver failure in MM is characterized by concomitant acute intravascular hemolytic anemia, which in some patients may be a first clinical symptom of MM. Diagnosing acute Wilson's liver failure is difficult because similar signs can be seen in other clinical conditions. In pregnant patients with undiagnosed WM, liver failure with hemolysis can be interpreted as HELLP (low platelet count) syndrome. Patients: We describe two women who developed clinical features of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and HELLP syndrome. In both, further diagnoses confirmed WD.

However, little research has been published on the role of anatomical-functional diagnostic modalities in assessing disease progression. Aim: To evaluate and compare the role of brain MRI and Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT in assessing brain involvement in Wilson's disease and correlating these results with the clinical presentations. METHODS: Eighteen patients with established Wilson's disease were included. The clinical picture was of the neurological type (nWD) in 11 patients (61.1%) and of the hepatic type (hWD) in 7 patients (38.9%). All patients underwent clinical assessment, cognitive assessment, ophthalmic slit-lamp examination, biochemical tests including urine copper and serum ceruloplasmin levels, abdominal ultrasound, liver biopsy (only in 5 patients), brain MRI and Tc-99m HMPAO - Subjected to brain SPECT. Results: Brain MRI was abnormal in 11/18 patients (sensitivity 61.1%). It was abnormal in 9/11 nWD patients (sensitivity 81.8%) and in 2/7 hWD patients (sensitivity 28.6%). Brain Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT was abnormal in 15 of 18 patients (sensitivity 83.3%). The scan was abnormal in 10/11 patients with nWD (sensitivity 90.9%) and in 5/7 patients with hWD (sensitivity 71.4%). There was a good correlation between the clinical presentation of the disease and radiological and SPECT findings. Conclusion: In Wilson's disease, brain SPECT has higher sensitivity than brain MRI in detecting brain damage.

1829,Analysis of several elements (trace metals) in serum and urine samples by inductively coupled dynamic reaction cell mass spectrometry,"Aim: Analysis of trace metals plays an important role in occupational surveillance, assessment of exposure levels in poisoning, and as an aid in certain clinical diagnoses (Wilson's disease). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with cell reaction/collision function that removes isobaric and polyatomic interferences has improved sensitivity and specificity in the analysis. This study evaluates the performance of Perkin-Elmer's ELAN DRC II instrument for the analysis of serum (Al, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Se, Zn) and urine (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb , Se, Zn) samples, in preparation for introduction to clinical service. Methods: Fresh gravimetric standard preparations (3-5 points; 20-fold dilution of PE multi-element calibration standard) for calibrating the ICP-MS were tested in each batch run with analyzes in Standard or DRC (NH3) mode. Imprecisions (within run, overall laboratory CVs) were evaluated from daily triplicate analyzes of quality control reagents (Urine:Bio-Rad; Serum:Seronorm) over a 5 day period. Limits of detection were assessed using replicates (n=10) of blank samples. Serial dilutions (5 points) with calculated recoveries were analyzed to assess linearity. A comparison of serum/urine copper and serum zinc levels as measured by ICP-MS and recent laboratory atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) was performed. Results: The calibration curves were linear through zero - fits typically achieved r2 0.990-0.999. The inaccuracy of the results within the run resulted in <10% CV for all elements in both serum and urine. The total laboratory CVs calculated were low, with the exception of Al, Mn, Se with >15% CV, indicating a plausible larger variance in the daily calibration of these elements in each run. Sensitivities were typically below 0.1 mg/L in standard mode and further improved in DRC mode. Linearity has been verified for each element - up to 5 orders of magnitude from 0.01-200 cups/L. Comparative data with a limited sample size (n=30) showed quite similar concentrations of serum/urine copper (serum y=1.05x + 1.14, rs 0.88; urine y=1.07x - 0.08, rs 0 .96) and serum zinc (y= 1.31x - 1.45, rs=0.85) values by ICP-MS and AAS.

1830,Factors predicting neurological deterioration after chelation therapy in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background: There is little information on the proportion of hepatic Wilson patients who deteriorate with chelation therapy. There is also little information about factors that predict neurological deterioration. In this cohort study, we aimed to investigate what percentage of patients with hepatic Wilson's disease develop neurological deterioration on dpenicillamine. Our aim was to identify prognostic factors that could predict neurological deterioration after initiation of chelation therapy. METHODS: We enrolled newly diagnosed Wilson's disease patients ranging in age from 3 to 18 years who had hepatic or combined hepatic and neurological manifestations. We ruled out fulminant Wilson's disease and other causes of chronic liver disease. Liver status was assessed using Child's MELD Score and New Wilson's Scoring Index. We examined putative predictive factors such as age, gender and mode of presentation i.e. liver versus combined liver and neurology. All patients were followed up to 2 years during d-penicillamine therapy. Results: One patient had clinical neurological involvement along with hepatic manifestation (10%). Four of 10 patients (40%) had CNS lesions in MRI brain at baseline. Factors such as MELD score and INR are significantly abnormal (p=0.032 and 0.01, respectively) in those patients whose neurologic deterioration began with chelation therapy. Conclusions: One-third of patients with Wilson's disease presenting with hepatic or combined hepatic and neurological manifestations deteriorate on D-penicillamine therapy.

1831,Effect of D-penicillamine on liver fibrosis and inflammation in Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease is a disorder of copper metabolism characterized by copper overload. A mutation in the ATP7B gene causes dysfunction of the ATP7B protein and a reduction in biliary copper excretion in hepatocytes. Excess copper accumulation leads to liver damage. D-penicillamine can primarily inhibit fibrogenesis and prevent the occurrence of cicatricial lesions in the liver. We have studied this phenomenon in our patients. Methods: Pathologic specimens from the explanted livers of 26 patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 with Wilson's disease with hepatoneurological manifestations and who had undergone liver transplantation were examined retrospectively. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to their D-penicillamine anamnesis before transplantation. The degree of fibrosis and inflammation was graded as mild (1), moderate (2), and severe (3) and reviewed by an impartial hepatopathologist. RESULTS: Of 26 patients (20 males, 6 females) with Wilson's disease with a mean age of 17.6 -/+ 8.6 years, 69% (18/26) had a history of D-penicillamine ingestion prior to liver transplantation from 6 months to 9 years (mean 3.4 -/+ 2.7 years). In the D-penicillamine group, 14 patients (77%) had grade 1 fibrosis. Grade 2 and 3 fibrosis was observed in 5.6% and 16% of patients, respectively. In the D-penicillamine group, inflammation was grade 3 in 44% (8/18), grade 2 in 44% (8/18), and grade 1 in 11% (2/18) of patients. In the non-D-penicillamine group (8 patients), the grades of fibrosis were Grade 3 (62%), Grade 2 (25%), and Grade 1 (12%); 87% of the patients had grade 2 and 3 inflammation. The degree of fibrosis was significantly lower in the D-penicillamine group than in the non-D-penicillamine group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: D-penicillamine may reduce the rate of liver fibrogenesis in patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Kazemi, K.;Geramizadeh, B.;Kakaei, F.;Nikeghbalian, S.;Malekhosseini, S.

1832,Spermidine/spermine actyltransferase is responsible for the metabolism of triethylenetetramine and other polyamine analogues in humans,"Triethylenetetramine (TETA), a copper(II) chelator traditionally used to treat Wilson's disease, and a number of structural analogues are currently in clinical trials for cancer. However, the metabolism of TETA has never been thoroughly studied, which is crucial for its advancement in cancer treatment. The two main metabolites of TETA found in humans are N1-acetyl-TETA (MAT) and N<sup>1</sup>, N<sup>1</sup>-diacetyl-TETA (DAT). Traditionally, drug acetylation has been thought to be catalyzed by N-acetyltransferase (NAT2). The FDA requires that the pharmacological properties of all drugs metabolized via the acetylation pathway be evaluated in populations with different NAT2 phenotypes. However, our most recent clinical study showed that there was no significant difference in the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and metabolite profiles of healthy volunteers with fast or slow NAT2 acetylation phenotype. We therefore hypothesize that the enzyme responsible for TETA acetylation is spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase (SSAT), which has never before been considered a drug metabolizing enzyme, and not NAT2. We performed in vitro drug metabolism assays to localize the enzyme responsible for TETA metabolism. TETA and MAT (as substrate) and acetyl-coenzyme A were incubated with human liver microsome and cytosol from 5 individuals separately in the presence or absence of pentamidine or acetaminophen. The formation of MAT from TETA and DAT from MAT was detected and measured using our previously published LC-MS method. Both the liver microsome and the cytosol could catalyze the biotransformation of TETA and MAT. The rate of metabolism in microsomes and cytosol varies in each individual. Metabolism rates in microsomes and cytosol also varied between individuals (Km range 223-909 M, Vmax range 96-482 pg/min/mg protein). Pentamidine, a specific inhibitor of x SSAT, could inhibit the response and increase Km by over 30%. While acetaminophen, a specific inhibitor of NAT2, showed no inhibitory effect. The same experiments were performed in rat liver microsomes and cytosol and, apart from the Km and Vmax values, similar results were obtained. TETA and two other analogues of polyamine, diethylnorspermine and diethylspermine, all of which are being studied for the treatment of cancer, were incubated with pure, fully recombinant human SSAT protein and formation of acetylated metabolites was observed. The identification of SSAT, never before considered a xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme, as the enzyme catalyzing the acetylation of polyamine analogs has significant clinical implications, particularly in clinical trial settings. Many polyamine analogues have been developed as potential anti-cancer drugs and many of them, including TETA, are in clinical trials. Finding the right enzyme (i.e., SSAT instead of the traditional NAT2) to study their biotransformation is critical to understanding their pharmacology, which is critical to the overall drug study.",,"Lu, J.;Li, M.;Xu, H.;Tingle, M.;Cooper, G.

1833,Wilson France: A national database for Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare inherited disorder with effective treatment when started early. Improving knowledge about this disease is a priority for the French national center of excellence for better access to diagnosis and treatment. This national organization has created a database. Objective: To improve knowledge about WD through an epidemiological study on the French cohort. Methods: We enrolled all patients, followed by all French centers collaborating with the national center of excellence. Results: Since 2006, 281 patients (1-73 years old) have been enrolled in the Wilson France database (sex ratio: 1). The mean age at diagnosis was 19 years. The first symptoms were neurological in 36% of the patients, hepatic in 38%, renal, psychiatric or hematological in 11%. Fifteen percent were diagnosed after familial screening. At the time of diagnosis, the Kayser-Fleischer ring was observed in 95% of patients with neurological symptoms, 55% of liver symptoms and 26% of pre-symptomatic forms. Mean ceruloplasminemia was low (0.08 g/L) but 5% of patients had normal values (>0.2 g/L). Mean urinary copper was elevated in 96% of patients. Genetic testing was equivocal in 15.9% of families (only one or no mutation found). Initial treatment was D-penicillamine in 85% of cases and after a median follow-up of 15 years, treatment was D-penicillamine for 44.4% of patients, trientine for 14.4%, zinc for 26.7%, association of chelator and zinc for 5.6%; 5.6% of patients had a liver transplant. Discussion: The database included approximately 1/3 of the Wilson's disease patients in France. Improving recruitment of Wilson's disease patients requires coordination of all healthcare professionals with a multidisciplinary approach. This work is realized in collaboration with the Eurowilson database.",,"Trocello, J. M.",2010,,,0,1,
1834,Elevated liver enzymes in a 6-year-old boy with severe hemophilia A leading to the pre-symptomatic diagnosis of Wilson's disease,"We report on a 6-year-old boy with severe hemophilia A (inversion of intron 22 of the FVIII gene) who was repeatedly diagnosed with moderately elevated levels of liver enzymes (AST and ALT) on routine examinations. No common cause of hepatitis (hepatitis B or C, CMV, EBV) was found, but further investigation revealed decreased serum ceruloplasmin concentration. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion was significantly increased. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was confirmed by evidence of composite heterozygosity for ATP7B gene mutations (R1041W and N1270S); Parents were heterozygous. Apart from transaminase elevations, no signs of hepatic dysfunction, no neurological signs and no Kayser-Fleischer ring were found; Ultrasound showed liver enlargement but normal parenchymal structure. Therapy with D-penicillamine and vitamin B6 was started and monitored by 24-hour urinary copper excretion and measurement of transaminases. Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that results in accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea and can result in hepatic and neuropsychiatric dysfunction. A slight but constant increase in transaminases can also indicate Wilson's disease. Pre-symptomatic diagnosis offers the possibility of early therapy with D-penicillamine or zinc acetate. Therefore, plasma ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion should be investigated in chronic liver enzyme elevations.",,"Hainmann, I.;Woltering, T.;Greiner, P.;Superti-Furga, A.;Zieger, B.",2010,,,0,0,
1835,Wilson's disease disguised as hepatic hydrothorax in a young woman,"Purpose: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism with hepatic or neurological presentation. Histopathologic findings of liver involvement vary from steatosis to end-stage cirrhosis. WD manifesting as acute or fulminant liver failure, hemolytic crisis, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and rarely decompensated cirrhosis have been described. This is the first case of WD presenting as worsening dyspnea secondary to right hepatic hydrothorax. Case Report: A 20-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted with progressive dyspnea for six months. She had no history of significant alcohol abuse or risk factors for viral hepatitis. Physical examination revealed mild jaundice, right pleural effusion, ascites, and peripheral edema. Kayser-Fleischer rings were not seen on slit lamp examination. Laboratory results showed slightly elevated transaminases and bilirubin, low albumin, coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. Computed tomography revealed a massive right-sided hydrothorax with mediastinal displacement, ascites and cirrhosis of the liver. Echocardiogram was normal. A right-sided chest tube was placed, resulting in high performance (>15 L) to drain transudative fluid and relieve symptoms. Further evaluation was remarkable for a low serum ceruloplasmin level of < 10 mg/dl and a high 24-hour urine copper (Cu) level of 270 µg. Liver biopsy showed micro- and macrovesicular steatosis with active cirrhosis, but could not measure Cu quantitatively due to lack of sufficient samples. Rhodanine staining for Cu was positive in one of the nodules. While waiting for the biopsy results, the patient developed tremors and worsening liver function. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed increased signal intensity in the globus pallidus, consistent with a lenticular deposition of Cu. The diagnosis of WD was made. She was started on trients and zinc and transferred to a liver transplant center where she successfully underwent a liver transplant. Discussion: Of 50% of patients with WM who present with liver disease, only 3% present with hepatic decompensation. Hepatic hydrothorax is an even rarer complication and is defined as a significant pleural effusion, usually > than 500 mL, in a patient with cirrhosis without cardiopulmonary disease. The pathophysiology involves the leakage of ascites fluid from the peritoneal cavity into the pleural space through the embryological defects, which more commonly occur in the right hemidiaphragm. Decompensated cirrhosis due to WD can be managed with drug therapy. Patients who fail treatment and those with hepatic hydrothorax require liver transplantation. A high clinical suspicion is required for early diagnosis and medical treatment.",,"Ghayam, S.;Ponugoti, S.;Pawa, S.",2010,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2010.320-7,0,0,
1836,Late-onset neurological Wilson's disease without KF rings or characteristic MRI findings,"Aim: To report an unusual case of genetically confirmed Wilson's disease (WD) presenting as late-onset parkinsonism without KF rings or characteristic MRI brain abnormalities. Background: The age of onset of WM is variable but generally occurs in the 2nd or 3rd decade. Neurological presentation is rare after 40 years and has not been reported in the absence of KF rings or characteristic brain MRI findings. As a result, screening for WD in patients with a movement disorder after this age is no longer routine and it remains unclear what the upper age limit for neurological phenoconversion is. Methods: case report. Results: A 50-year-old man presented with a 15-month history of left hand tremor, left arm stiffness, insomnia, and anxiety. Examination showed predominantly left-sided parkinsonism with resting tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. KF rings were missing. Quetiapine and olanzapine have been used briefly to treat anxiety after the onset of motor symptoms, but were discontinued at least 2 months before presentation. Parkinson's subsequently failed to respond to ropinirole, pramipexole and only minimally to levodopa up to 200 mg three times a day. The examination included a normal MRI of the brain and a normal EEG. Two years later, a research project unexpectedly found a low serum ceruloplasmin of 4.1. Repeat studies in a commercial laboratory were ceruloplasmin 7.4 mg/dl (25-63), serum copper 28 g/dl (70-150), urine copper 65 g/24 hours (3-35). Iron studies and LFTs were normal. A formal ophthalmological examination revealed no KF rings. ATP7B gene sequencing (Mayo Clinic) revealed 2 different known pathogenic WD mutations (compound heterozygous). The patient was treated with zinc for 6 months without improvement. Liver biopsy revealed elevated copper levels without cirrhosis, and repeat slit-lamp examination at an academic medical center revealed no KF rings. The current treatment is Trientine. Conclusions: The diagnosis of WM was made incidentally after a research project found low serum ceruloplasmin. This case suggests that late-onset WD is more common than previously thought, expanding the spectrum of phenotypic expression to include parkinsonism, which presents in later adulthood without the presence of KF rings or MRI abnormalities. Screening for WD with a serum ceruloplasmin should be routinely performed in patients who present later in life with Parkinson's disease, tremor, or dystonia.",,"Molho, E.

1837,The novel angiogenesis inhibitor tetrathiomolybdate enhances the tumor cell-killing effectiveness of the oncolytic virus,"Oncolytic viruses (OV) are modified viruses specifically designed to lyse cancer cells while leaving the surrounding tissue intact. Although effective at killing tumors, OV therapy has shown limited efficacy against glioma in clinical trials. The tumor microenvironment may impede OV proliferation and spread; in particular, the angiogenic and inflammatory responses following OV inoculation have been shown to significantly limit OV efficacy. Copper supports angiogenesis and its physiological level has been shown to inhibit infection and replication of wild-type HSV. The aim of our current project is to determine if the copper chelating agent tetrathiomolybdate can be used to improve overall OV efficacy in malignant glioma. Tetrathiomolybdate is already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Wilson's disease and is being evaluated for safety and efficacy. Previous results indicate that the anticancer effects of OV can be significantly enhanced by pretreatment with an angiostatic agent. The angiostatic and immunosuppressive properties of tetrathiomolybdate make it an ideal candidate to enhance OV therapy. To confirm this, we tested whether copper inhibits OV-mediated glioma cell killing and whether tetrathiomolybdate may be counteractive. We found that copper at physiological concentrations in serum can significantly inhibit glioma cell killing and viral replication. This inhibition of cell killing by OV incubated with copper was observed with several different OVs tested. Viral replication and cytotoxicity assay data indicated that tetrathiomolybdate-mediated copper chelation could salvage copper-inhibited viral replication, resulting in enhanced tumor cell-killing efficacy. Based on these results, we tested the therapeutic efficacy of the combination of tetrathiomolybdate with OV against a U251T3 subcutaneous glioma model. We found a significant increase in the antitumor response of animals treated with tetrathiomolybdate plus OV compared to animals treated with OV alone. Overall, our results indicate that the combination of tetrathiomolybdate and OV produces a strong efficacy profile compared to OV alone, suggesting that co-administration of tetrathiomolybdate in patients can enhance OV efficacy.",,"Yoo, J.

1838,Wilson's disease: 1 year total experience from a single center,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. This rare disease is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, which is important for copper excretion in the bile and leads to copper accumulation in the liver. Toxic levels of copper can also be found in the brain and kidneys, and clinical phenotypes include hepatic, hemolytic, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. WD has a wide range of clinical manifestations. Affected children can be completely asymptomatic and diagnosis difficult. The aim of this study is to present our single center experience over a year with WD, which underlies its various presentations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the past 12 months (April 2009 to April 2010), 5 patients (3 males) met the criteria for a diagnosis of WM. Evaluation included a detailed physical examination, conventional laboratory tests (urinary copper excretion, serum ceruloplasmin levels), genetic analysis, and liver biopsy. 3 patients had isolated liver disease, 1 patient had mixed neurological and hepatic involvement, and 1 patient had acute liver failure. All 3 cirrhotic patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Results: The median age at diagnosis of WM was 10.8 (range: 7-16). All patients had hepatic manifestations of the disease at the time of diagnosis: cirrhosis (2), chronic hepatitis (2), and fulminant hepatic failure (1). Two patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis. 1 of the symptomatic patients presented the typical neurological symptoms, initially with behavioral changes and worsening of schoolwork, which progressed to lack of motor coordination, drooling, dysarthria, dystonia, and spasticity as the disease progressed. At diagnosis, only the patient with neurological manifestations had a positive Kayser-Fleischer ring. Serum ceruloplasmin levels were decreased in all patients, median 9.2 mg/dL (range 2-16), with lower levels in patients with cirrhosis. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion was increased in all patients, >75 µg/24 hours before (median value 360 µg/24) or >1400 µg/24 hours after penicillamine challenge. Genetic analysis showed double eterozighosis in 3/5, the other 2 patients had only 1 recognized mutation. A copper content of more than 250 µg/g liver dry weight proved to be diagnostically significant in all patients. We started zinc therapy (zinc acetate) in all patients at the time of diagnosis, only in the patient with neurological symptoms with an additional copper chelator such as trientine. None of 3 patients with cirrhosis recovered on therapy and avoided liver transplantation. Zinc acetate therapy was started in the 2 asymptomatic patients and was well tolerated. In these 2 patients, liver function tests showed improvement after 3 weeks of therapy and reached normal values in 2 months for both. The indication for liver transplantation was acute with chronic (2/3) or fulminant liver failure (1/3). The median follow-up time after liver transplantation was 1 year, 1 patient died from perioperative complications (66% patient survival). The copper metabolism normalized in all patients. None of the transplanted patients with liver disease alone required chelation therapy after liver transplantation and none developed neurological symptoms of Wilson's disease. Conclusion: The detection of WM in children remains very difficult also due to the low frequency of cases, but our 1-year experience shows a higher frequency than reported in the literature. The most important examination is the liver biopsy with determination of the liver copper. If in doubt, a genetic analysis can help. Ceruloplasmin, hemoglobin, ALT, ALP and plasma albumin differed significantly between fulminant and non-fulminant WD and could be used as indirect markers in the assessment of urgent OLT. It is important to be aware of the different manifestations of Wilson's disease in the pediatric population in order to be able to carry out appropriate examinations in time to facilitate early diagnosis, ensure adequate treatment and avoid the risk of underestimation.",,"Pietrobattista, A.;Candusso, M.;Alterio, A.;Sartorelli, M.;Francalanci, P.;Comparcola, D.;Nobili, V.;Torre, G.",2010,October,,0,1,
1839,Hepatocellular carcinoma in neurological Wilson disease,"Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Wilson's disease with cirrhosis is extremely uncommon. Liver copper is said to be a protective factor against the development of cancer. Patients with neurological Wilson disease are rarely monitored for tumors. Case Report: A 30-year-old man was diagnosed 4 years previously with neurological Wilson's disease based on clinical features, the presence of a KF ring, elevated urinary copper and a positive penicillamine challenge test. His liver function tests were normal. He was aggressively treated with D-penicillamine and zinc, resulting in significant improvement in neurology and clearing of the KF ring. Six months earlier, he was evaluated for symptoms in the right upper quadrant. A 10 cm hepatocellular cancer was found in the right posterior region of the liver. HCV RNA, HBsAg, anti-HBc, HBV DNA, ANA were all negative. We performed a segment VII/VIII resection from which the patient recovered without complications. A moderately differentiated HCC in the context of cirrhosis was confirmed histologically. Interestingly, the copper levels in the liver were very low, probably due to aggressive chelation therapy. Discussion: Liver copper protects against Wilson's disease. Reports of HCC in Wilson's disease are extremely rare, particularly in patients with neurological Wilson's disease and no hepatic manifestations. In previous reports, hepatitis may coexist or have not been ruled out. In the present case, hepatitis B and C were excluded. We postulate that aggressive chelation therapy depleted the liver of protective copper, leading to carcinogenesis.",,"Shah, S.",2010,April,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1477-2574.2010.00165.x,0,0,
1840,CD8 T-cell lymphopenia and functional asplenia in an infant with impaired neural crest development associated with ZEB2 mutation and Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS),"INTRODUCTION: We report abnormal immune findings in a patient with zinc finger protein deficiency and MWS. Case Report: A 2.5-year-old man with Hirschsprung's disease and MWS was presented for evaluation of asplenia. MWS was diagnosed at birth with genetic testing showing a chromosome 2q22.3 mutation and ZEB2 deficiency. On the 2nd day of life, a small spleen was found and PCN prophylaxis was started. No previous history of serious infection was reported, except enterocolitis at age 1. Vaccination for sacrificed children was up to date; the patient never received live viral vaccines. The immune evaluation revealed a blood count with a slightly elevated eosinophil count. Peripheral swab confirms asplenia. Serum immunoglobulins showed low IgA and IgM levels, but normal IgG and IgE levels. The oxidative burst assay was normal. Vaccine serological responses revealed 2 out of 7 protective antibody levels to Prevnar vaccine and an indeterminate response to tetanus. Lymphocyte phenotyping revealed low CD3+ T cells, low CD3+CD8+ T cells (3.9%; normal lower limit of 16.0%), but normal CD3+CD4+ T cells. B cell, natural killer cell, and HLA-DR measurements were reasonable. T cells showed an adequate response to mitogen and antigen stimulation. Four weeks after booster vaccination (Prevnar 13, DTaP), protective antibody levels of all 13 pneumococcal serotypes, tetanus, diphtheria and hemophilus were detected. Repeated lymphocyte phenotyping again showed low CD3+ T cells and low CD3+CD8+ T cells. The evaluation for latent viral infection was negative. Discussion: ZEB2 is the zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox-2 gene responsible for embryonic development of neural crest cells. CD8 homeostasis is undefined, but abnormalities in CD8 cell expression have been reported in MHC class I deficiency, ZAP-70 deficiency, and IL-7 deficiency. Our patient does not appear to have IL-7 disorders as CD3+CD4+ cells are present in normal numbers; there is no evidence of MHC class I deficiency. ZAP 70 deficiency, another zinc finger deficiency, has a T cell dysfunction that was not observed in this patient. Neurological disorders have been linked to immunodeficiency, e.g. B. Ataxia telangiectasia, ADA deficiency, Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Patients with MWS (impaired neural crest development) should be evaluated for evidence of immunologic abnormalities, including asplenia.",,"Shroff, P.;Potocki, L.;Chinen, J.;Hanson, I.

1841,An unexpected new antioxidant-like activity for the classic copper-chelating drug penicillamine,"Penicillamine (beta,beta'-dimethylcysteine) has been used extensively clinically as a copper chelating drug to treat copper overload in Wilson's disease. In this study, we found that penicillamine provides significant protection in human fibroblasts against cytotoxicity induced by tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ, a major toxic metabolite of the widely used wood preservative pentachlorophenol), while other copper chelators such as BCS (bathocuproine disulfonate) and trientine do not. The auto-oxidation process of TCHQ yielding the reactive tetrachlorosemiquinone (TCSQ) radical was studied using ESR and UV-Vis spectral methods. Interestingly and surprisingly, it was found that the formation of TCSQ radicals is dramatically retarded by penicillamine in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, penicillamine disulfide (the oxidized form of penicillamine), N-acetylpenicillamine, BCS, and trientine had no detectable effect on TCHQ auto-oxidation. HPLC-MS studies showed that the TCSQ radical was reduced by penicillamine to TCHQ, which was simultaneously oxidized to its corresponding disulfide form. These data indicate that the protective effect of penicillamine on TCHQ-induced cytotoxicity was not due to its binding of copper but rather to its reduction of the reactive TCSQ radical to the much less reactive TCHQ. This is the first report showing unexpected, novel antioxidant activity for this classic copper-chelating aminothiol drug, which could prove highly relevant to penicillamine's biological activities.",,"Zhu, B.

1842,Copper disrupts nuclear receptor function in Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the Cu-transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7b) that results in excessive hepatic copper accumulation and is associated with steatosis, cholestasis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. The animal model of Wilson's disease (Atp7b-/-) has decreased expression of multiple hepatic nuclear receptor signaling pathways, including decreased expression of the FXR:RXR target gene. Methods: DNA binding was measured by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) using the following: in vitro translated FXR and RXR proteins synthesized with copper (CuSO4) and/or zinc (ZnSO4) (1-40 muM); Nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells treated with 75 µM CDCA, +/- metals (5 µM CuSO4 and/or 40 µM ZnSO4) for 16 hours; and nuclear extracts from control and Atp7b-/-mice. Total RNA was harvested from HepG2 cells (as indicated above) and gene expression [bile salt export pump (BSEP, Abcb11), metallothionein (Met)2, FXR and TNFalpha] measured by real-time PCR. Results: In vitro translation of RXR with 4-40 µM CuSO4 resulted in complete loss of FXR:RXR binding to the SHP and BSEP promoters, and addition of 40 µM ZnSO4 to the reaction restored binding to the SHP and BSEP promoters restored. FXR and RXR protein expression was not reduced by metal in the in vitro translation reaction (measured by Western blot and S35 methione incorporation). Binding of FXR to the BSEP and SHP promoters in liver nuclear extracts was reduced in Atp7b-/- mice; however, binding of NFkappaB (non-zinc finger transcription factor) or SP1 complex (non-zinc finger transcription factor) was not different between control and Atp7b-/- mice. In HepG2 cells, CuSO4 treatment decreased CDCA induction of BSEP mRNA expression by 80% (P < 0.05), which was increased to 40% (P < 0.05) of CDCA treatment alone. Met2 mRNA expression was increased in HepG2 cells by 2- (P<0.05, CDCA treatment), 7- (P<0.05, CuSO4 treatment), and 50-fold (P<0.01 , CDCA+CuSO4+ZnSO4 treatment) significantly increased. FXR and TNFalpha mRNA expression was not altered by CuSO4 treatment. In addition, CuSO4 treatment of HepG2 cells eliminated nuclear extract binding to the BSEP promoter. Conclusions: Copper disrupts nuclear receptor binding activity and decreases hepatic target gene expression. DNA binding experiments in models with excess copper suggest that displacement of zinc by copper in the zinc finger of nuclear receptors promotes Wilson's disease pathology and addition of excess zinc can ameliorate the negative effects of copper on nuclear receptor activity.",,"Wooton-Kee, C.

1843,Eisen and the HFE gene in Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism that leads to liver failure and progressive neurological deterioration in untreated patients. Animal studies and several case reports have suggested hepatic iron overload or changes in iron processing in WM. Consistent with these findings, a significantly higher HFE mutation frequency was reported in small series of WM patients. The aim of the current study was to evaluate iron metabolism and HFE gene frequencies in WM patients and to analyze treatment effects due to chelation therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 143 WM patients treated at Heidelberg University Hospital between 1968 and 2009 were retrospectively evaluated. Parameters of the clinical picture, liver function and iron metabolism were recorded. EDTA blood samples from the patients were analyzed for changes in the HFE gene (H63D; C282Y) using standard RT-PCR techniques. Results: Contrary to previous reports in our large cohort of WM patients, allele frequencies of HFE gene mutations (HFE mutation in 143 patients: 120 wild type, 3 C282Y heterozygous, 1 C282Y homozygous, 16 H63D heterozygous, 2 H63D homozygous u 1 H63D/C282Y compound-heterozygous) were 2.1% for C282Y and 7.3% for H63D, but were consistent with the frequencies obtained for the general population. Mutations in the HFE gene were not predictors for early clinical manifestation or a fulminant clinical course of Wilson's disease. To further elucidate the role of reduced ceruloplasmin (CP) levels and lack of its ferrooxidase activity, patients were divided into subgroups according to their CP levels. Patients with pronounced hypoceruloplasminemia (CP < 0.1 g/l) showed increased ferritin and reduced transfer (p < 0.05). In our cohort, different treatment regimens (D-penicillamine, trientine, zinc, or combination therapy with a chelating agent and zinc) did not alter parameters of iron metabolism. Discussion: Hypoceruloplasminemia seems to have only a minor influence on the parameters of iron metabolism despite the reduced ferroxidase activity of ceruloplasmin. Individual mutations in the HFE gene may be additional risk factors for clinically significant iron overload, but allele frequencies indicate no association between WM and hereditary HFE-related hemochromatosis. The effects of chelation therapy in WM on iron metabolism appear to be small and in most cases of no clinical relevance.",,"Pfeiffenberger, J.;Gotthardt, D.;Seessle, J.;Herrmann, T.;Stremmel, W.;Weiss, K.

1844,Alterations in lipid metabolism in Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism that results in toxic accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, and other tissues. The development of hepatic steatosis is a common symptom in early stages. Animal models (ATP7b-/- and LEC rats) show changes in lipid metabolism when serum levels of triglycerides and cholesterol are reduced. Changes in lipid metabolism in humans have not been extensively studied in WM, but previous studies have suggested an impact of specific WM treatment. A decrease in total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) with zinc therapy raises the question of whether this treatment might be atherogenetic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 251 WM patients treated at Heidelberg University Hospital between 1990 and 2009 were retrospectively examined. Patients were followed by gender, treatment (DPA, trientine, or zinc), or manifestation (hepatic, neurological, mixed, and asymptomatic) for analysis of disease course and laboratory values (including serum lipid profile, triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, lipoprotein (a), serum bile acids , adiponectin and leptin). The occurrence of vascular events during therapy and the prevalence of coronary heart disease were recorded. Results: Serum lipids did not differ statistically between men and women in either treated or untreated patients. Interestingly, in treatment-naïve patients, cholesterol levels in liver patients were median by 158 (66-319) mg/dl vs. neurological 194 (123-243) mg/dl or mixed 186 (145-244) mg/dl or asymptomatic patients 195 ( 173-294) mg/dl. These differences diminished with treatment for at least 12 months. In contrast to previous studies, we observed no decreases in total cholesterol or HDL with zinc treatment or chelation-based therapy. Vascular events were rare and did not differ statistically between treatment groups or between patients with different manifestations. However, serum lipoprotein (a) was remarkably higher in neurologically affected patients than in patients with predominant liver disease. CONCLUSION: Only minor changes were found in the serum lipid profile of WM patients that were reduced during therapy. In contrast to animal models of the disease, the amount of triglycerides and cholesterol was not reduced. Our data indicate no significant atherogenetic effects of medical treatments for WD.",,"Seessle, J.;Gohdes, A. M.;Gotthardt, D.;Pfeiffenberger, J.;Stremmel, W.;Weiss, K.

1845,The Toronto Western Hospital Wilson's Disease Study: Perspectives of an Urban Adult Outpatient Center,"OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical experience in adult patients with Wilson's disease (WD) followed by an urban outpatient setting. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of WM was performed. Results: 59 charts were identified; Based on the Leipzig scores, 44 met the criteria for probable (score >= 4) and 10 for probable WD (score 2-3). The review excluded 6 cases (1 probable, 5 probable). Presentation characteristics of the 48 included patients are shown in Table 1. At review, the median duration of treatment was 11.5 years (range 0.1-42 years). D-penicillamine (DP) was the most common initial therapy (48%), followed by zinc (23%), trientine (15%), DP and zinc (6%), and 8% unknown (initiation of treatment as part of a double-blind study ). At the review, zinc was the most common therapy (65%), followed by DP (17%), trientine (12%), and dual therapy (6%). Side effects were most evident with DP (41%) compared to zinc (19%) or trientine (10%). Overall, liver biopsy and/or imaging revealed portal hypertension in 63% of patients and cirrhosis in 53% of patients. Liver biopsy (n=31) also identified fibrosis in 94% of patients, inflammatory activity in 68% and steatosis in 65%. On evaluation, 10 patients had mitochondrial EM changes and 13 had glycogenated nuclei. The mean copper concentration in the liver was 4.11 muM/g (range 0.22-20.43). During follow-up, 3 patients developed hepatic encephalopathy and 2 developed jaundice. 2 patients developed ascites (one of whom was initially asymptomatic) and 1 variceal bleeding was documented. At the time of review, there was one death and one transplant. Neurological WM patients (n=21) presented a median of 4 neurological signs consistent with WM. At review, 14 patients had fewer neurological signs, 2 the same number, 4 more signs (1 patient lost follow-up). Three patients with non-neurological presentation developed neurological symptoms, one of whom recovered to baseline. Eleven patients had at least one episode of documented neurological decline while on treatment. In patients who underwent MRI (n=26), signal abnormalities were seen in the basal ganglia (62%), brainstem (50%), white matter pathways (38%), and thalamus (28%). Eight patients (31%) had normal brain MRIs. Of the patients with a second MRI (n=11), 36% saw almost complete improvement.

1846,Symptomatic Wilson's disease during long-term maintenance zinc monotherapy after initial penicillamine decoupling: experience in 30 patients,"The outcome of zinc monotherapy alone in symptomatic Wilson's disease may be unfavorable, particularly in the case of advanced liver disease (Hepatol 2009;50:1442-52). Initial decoppering with penicillamine might improve outcome, but available data is scarce and long-term follow-up is unavailable. We report here our experience with such an approach in 30 symptomatic patients during (median) 29 (range 0.5-48) years of follow-up (FU). Presentation was hepatic only, neurological only, or combined in 14, 3, and 13 cases, respectively. The mean age at diagnosis was 14 (range 7-37) years. Duration and dose of the initial administration of penicillamine were 2 (0.5–21) years and 873 (162–2000) mg, respectively. and the subsequent zinc 23 (0.5-42) years and 175 (68-279) mg resp. Of the 27 patients with hepatic or combined presentation, 3 had initially decompensated cirrhosis, 11 had compensated cirrhosis, and 13 had less severe disease. Of the 3 patients with initial decompensated cirrhosis, 1 improved to compensated cirrhosis and remained so for 23 years FU, 1 was transplanted at 0.5 years, and 1 initially improved but died 12 years later from complications of cirrhosis. Of the 11 patients with initially compensated cirrhosis (median FU 31 years), 1 died after 2 years from penicillamine-induced myelinolysis, 3 died from complications of liver disease after 17, 20, and 30 years of therapy, and 7 remained stable after a median 29 years of FU. Of 13 patients with less severe liver disease, 9 worsened, including 5 to compensated cirrhosis and 1 to decompensated cirrhosis (the latter recovered after addition of trientine). Progressive liver disease was associated with longer follow-up (median 31 vs. 26 years, P=0.03) but could not be clearly explained by dose or duration of therapy or efficiency of decoppering (based on 24-hour urinary copper excretion and serum non-ceruloplasmin). bound copper concentration at the end of FU). Of the 16 patients with initial neurological or combined presentation, neurological symptoms improved in 7, remained stable in 4, and worsened in 5 (including 1 with subsequent death from pneumonia). 3 patients with hepatic presentation only developed neurological symptoms and one patient with neurological presentation only developed liver disease during follow-up. Major side effects occurred exclusively with penicillamine: glomerulonefritis (n=2) and death from myelinolysis (n=1). In summary, although the short-term clinical outcome is often satisfactory, hepatic Wilson's disease tends to progress during long-term zinc monotherapy, even after initial penicillamine decoupling.",,"Ras, J.;Houwen, R.;Linn, F.

1847,Therapeutic plasma exchange as a bridge to liver transplantation in a pediatric patient with Wilson's disease,"Purpose: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting in copper accumulation primarily in the liver but ultimately in many organs and tissues. A small number of patients with WD present initially with fulminant hepatic failure, hypercuperemia, and intravascular hemolysis. Therapeutic goals for these patients include rapid removal of the copper by hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and preparation of the patient for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Here we report on a pediatric patient treated with TPE as a bridge to OLT. Case Report: The patient was a 6-year-old man with WD who presented with fulminant hepatic failure. He had recently been diagnosed with urinary copper excretion of 1480 lg/day and was receiving trientine chelation therapy. The patient suffered from jaundice with elevated liver function tests, coagulopathy and a moderate anemia that was negative in the direct antiglobulin test. TPE was initiated as a stabilizing agent until an OLT was possible. A total of 5 single volumes (1500 mL) of TPE were performed over the course of eleven days using the Cobe Spectra cell separator (CaridianBCT, Lakewood, CO) with fresh frozen plasma as the surrogate. Because of transfusion and chelation therapy, urine and serum copper levels have been unreliable markers of copper stores. In addition, the patient diagnosed with autism had an unexpected transient improvement in mental status after the first TPE. OLT was performed 15 days after his last admission and 12 days after the start of TPE. The course after transplantation was uneventful. Currently, 5 months post transplant, the patient remains on chelation therapy and is doing well. Conclusions: TPE was a successful add-on therapy to bridge this patient with WD and fulminant liver failure to OLT. Clinical trials investigating the role of TPEs in WD are needed to further determine whether this therapy should be mainstreamed.",,"Morgan, S. M.;Zantek, N.

1848,Novel dermatological manifestations of Mowat-Wilson syndrome including photosensitivity and dyspigmentation,"The authors report a previously reported patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) with unusual dermatological features, including photosensitivity and skin dyspigmentation.<sup>1</sup> An 18-month-old Afro-Caribbean boy with Hirschsprung's disease, hypospadias, delayed visual maturation , microcephaly, developmental delay, seizures, and dysmorphic facial features was referred to dermatology. Since birth he presented with persistent skin dyspigmentation with patchy macular hypo- and hyperpigmentation affecting the face and neck, upper limbs, trunk, perineum and right ankle. There was no history of previous inflammation or eczema. According to the original report, his parents described photosensitivity from the age of 2, with a sunburn-like erythema appearing within minutes of sun exposure, despite wearing a high SPF sunscreen. Investigations including lupus serology and porphyria screening were normal. The patient is currently awaiting a formal photo test. Genetic analysis previously identified a heterozygous truncating mutation in exon 8 of the ZEB2 gene (formerly ZFHXIB; zinc finger homeobox 1B), confirming MWS. MWS was first described in 1998 and included characteristic facial dysmorphism, severe learning disabilities, epilepsy, Hirschprung disease and other congenital abnormalities that were mapped to a locus on chromosome 2q21-q23.<sup>2</sup> In 2001, the causative gene ZEB2 was identified .<sup>3</sup> Over 100 pathogenetic heterozygous mutations or deletions are then described.<sup>4</sup> The distinctive developing facial ZEB2 co-encodes the Smad-interacting protein (SIP1), a ubiquitous transcription factor an important role in embryonic development including the neural crest. ""Raindrop"" pigmentation was previously reported in a 9-year-old patient with MWS.<sup>6</sup> This indicates that MWS should be added to the spectrum of neurocutaneous disorders, including dyspigmentation and Hirschsprung. We can speculate that the dyspigmentation is due to ZEB2 haploinsufficiency, which disrupts neural crest melanocyte development or migration. Our case is the first demonstration of photosensitivity in MWS, raising the possibility of an additional role for ZEB2 in regulating skin response to ultraviolet radiation.",,"Kaur, B.;Taibjee, S.;Abdullah, A.;Shannon, N.",2010,April,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/adc.2010.186338.36,0,0,
1849,Efficacy and tolerability of zinc in the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Aims and Study: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of zinc acetate in the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD) in children. METHODS: Twenty-six WM patients treated with zinc acetate were included in this multicenter study. Clinical and biological data were collected using a questionnaire: age and symptoms at diagnosis of WM, age at the start of zinc therapy, effectiveness on biological parameters, side effects. Results: At presentation, 23 patients (88%) were asymptomatic, mostly diagnosed during a family investigation; Twenty-three patients (88%) had liver disease and one (4%) had neurological symptoms. A Kayser-Fleischer ring was present in 15% of cases. The diagnosis of WM was made at a median age of 8 years (0.8-16.1). According to the center, the percentage of WM patients treated with zinc varied between 8.5 and 61.5%. D-penicillamine was associated in 18 patients (69%), trientine in 4 (15%), and 3 patients (11%) received the 3 drugs. Zinc therapy was started in 12 patients (46%) at the time of diagnosis, in 8 cases as the only drug. The median age at the start of zinc therapy was 10.8 years (2.3-12.3) and 2.6 years after the diagnosis of WM. Children receiving zinc alone started at age 7 years (2.3-11.1), 5 months after diagnosis of WM. Zinc was started at the recommended dosage in 11 children and increased gradually in 15 patients. A dose above the recommended dose was used in 5 out of 6 patients under 5 years of age, 10 out of 19 patients between 6 and 15 years of age and 1 out of 1 patients over 16 years of age. After starting treatment, median urinary ALT and copper levels normalized within 5 months. Thereafter, urinary copper levels remained below 50 mg/24 h in all patients except one patient with poor compliance. Epigastralgia (n=4), vomiting and diarrhea (n=1), leukopenia (n=1), and transient increases in serum lipase (n=1) were observed. Conclusion: Although rarely used in the treatment of WM, zinc acetate is effective and well tolerated. Dosing and monitoring guidelines should be followed more closely.",,"Lapeyre, D.;Gottrand, F.;Debray, D.;Bridoux-Henno, L.;Lachaux, A.;Morali, A.;Lamireau, T.",2010,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000383075.98243.67,0,1,
1850,Wilson's disease in children: monocentric experience analyzing 114 children over an 18-year period,"Aims and study: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism with a very variable spectrum of clinical manifestations in childhood. We evaluated the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 114 children with WD to determine the clinical presentation, diagnostic course, and outcome. METHODS: The medical reports of 114 children (63 boys) diagnosed with WM between 1991 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Physical examination, laboratory tests and liver biopsies of the patients were evaluated. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 9.5 +/- 3.2 years (1.5-16 years). The majority of the parents (81, 71.1%) were related by blood. Eighty-seven (76.3%) patients were diagnosed as symptomatic, including 12 patients who were symptomatic and presented with acute liver failure. Twenty-seven patients were diagnosed through family screening. A total of 80 patients presented with hepatic, 5 with neurological, and 17 with both hepatic and neurological features. Hepatomegaly was the most common clinical finding in 41 patients, while splenomegaly was jaundice and ascites were found in 26, 25, and 24 patients, respectively. Kayser-Fleischer rings were present in 63 of 109 patients (57.8%), while serum ceruloplasmin -Levels in 97 of the 114 patients evaluated (85.1%) were below 20 mg/dl. Copper excretion was above 80 mg/24 hours in 85 of 102 patients (83.3%), in 53 (67.0%) of Copper was found in the liver in excess of 250 mg/g dry weight in 79 patients; cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis were the most common findings in liver biopsy (23/79, 29.1% for z ach). All patients with acute liver failure died except one who had a liver transplant. At diagnosis, 97 non-fulminant WM patients were treated with D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate, 5 with trientine and zinc sulfate. A total of 6 children were switched to trientine because of adverse reactions to penicillamine (nephrotic syndrome in 2, worsening of liver function in 2, Stevens-Johnson reaction in 1, allergic rash in 1 patient). Five patients had liver transplantation during follow-up. Seventy-six nonfulminant WM patients were followed for 5.0 +/- 3.7 years (3 months to 14 years). Five patients died during follow-up due to end-stage liver disease. Eighteen patients who did not adhere to chelation therapy had poor outcomes. Conclusion: Wilson's disease in children can present in a variety of forms and requires extensive evaluation for diagnosis. Drug treatment is helpful for a stable or improved course of a non-fulminant disease. Fulminant WD is almost fatal without a liver transplant.",,"Yuce, A.;Uslu, N.;Balamtekin, N.;Demir, H.;Saltik Temizel, I.;Baysoy, G.;Usta, Y.;H, O. zen;Gurakan, F.",2010,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000383075.98243.67,0,1,
1851,Reassessment of diagnostic criteria for Wilson disease in children with mild liver disease,"Aims and study: Wilson disease (WD) is a difficult diagnosis, particularly in children. Early diagnosis is desirable to prevent disease progression. The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the conventional diagnostic criteria and the Ferenci diagnostic score (1) in WM children with mild liver disease. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 43 consecutive children with WM (28 boys, age range: 1.1–20.9 years) and 58 age- and sex-matched patients with liver disease other than WM. Both groups were asymptomatic with hypertransaminasemia as the predominant sign of liver disease. In all WM patients, the diagnosis was confirmed by molecular analysis and/or liver copper content. Results: ROC analysis for ceruloplasmin at a cut-off of <20 mg/dl showed a sensitivity of 95.4% (95% CIs, 84.5-99.4%) and a specificity of 84.4% ( 95% CIs, 72.5-92.6%). The optimal diagnostic cut-off for basal urinary copper was > 40 mcg/24 h (sensitivity of 78% [95% CI, 62.4-89.4%] and specificity of 87.9% [95%- CI, 76.7-95%]). Copper in urine after penicillamine challenge had a sensitivity of only 15.4%. Liver copper >250 µg/g dry weight had a sensitivity of 96.7% [95% CIs, 82.8-99.9%] and a specificity of 95.8% [95% CIs, 78.9-99.9% ]). Ferenci's diagnostic score showed a positive predictive value of 93% and a negative predictive value of 91.6%, respectively. Conclusion: Urinary copper excretion indicates WD if it is above 40 mcg/24 h instead of 100 mcg/24 h as suggested in recent AASLD guidelines (2). Instead, a penicillamine challenge test should not be performed in asymptomatic patients. Ferenci's diagnostic score shows good diagnostic accuracy. Diagnosing WD requires multiple tests and a high index of suspicion (table presented).",,"Ranucci, G.;Nicastro, E.;Vajro, P.;Vegnente, A.;Iorio, R.",2010,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000383075.98243.67,0,0,
1852,Extracorporeal liver support therapy,"INTRODUCTION. Extracorporeal liver support therapy is in its infancy but is valued as a detoxification treatment option for cirrhotic patients whose liver function is rapidly deteriorating. We report the use of Prometheus, a new extracorporeal liver assist system that enables the removal of protein-bound and water-soluble toxins by fractional plasma separation and absorption (FPSA) in a patient with Wilson's disease (WD) who developed rapid deterioration in his liver function. METHODS. A 26-year-old female patient, diagnosed with MM since the age of 17, was initially treated irregularly with penicillamine. The therapy was stopped. Now, 2 years later, she developed acute decompensated liver failure with hepatic encephalopathy with a MELD 29. Liver transplantation (LT) was the treatment option for this patient. But in this case, the rapid and unfavorable development of liver failure with renal failure and the unknown waiting time for an emergency liver donor in our country made us apply the extracorporeal liver support therapy. RESULTS. After 5 h 30 min of therapy we reduced the amount of bilirrubin to less than half, we increased urinary output and the next day the patient went for liver transplantation, stable, with improved kidney function. CONCLUSIONS. Acute hepatic failure due to WD is mostly fatal without emergency LT. This case report highlights the discontinuation of chelating agent treatment in a patient with WM. When the patient progressed to decompensated liver cirrhosis with encephalopathy, LT was the only treatment option, but although we cannot get a donor, we can use extracorporeal liver support therapy for a short period as a very useful bridge. Results from two studies recently presented at the EASL 2010 Congress have shown that treatment with extracorporeal devices may not confer a survival benefit to patients with severe liver failure, despite beneficial dialysis effects. However, results are promising in a small subset of patients, such as critically ill patients with hepatorenal syndrome type 1 or a MELD score above 30.",,"Marinho, A. D.;Pais, T.

1853,"Anesthesia management of a pediatric patient with Wilson's disease, spinal anesthesia safe - a case report","Wilson's disease, characterized by cirrhosis, extrapyramidal symptoms and Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings, is a rare inherited disorder of human copper metabolism. Wilson's disease involves loss of the ability to export copper from the liver to the bile and to incorporate copper into hepatic ceruloplasmin. Copper accumulates in various organs and tissues, especially in the liver, brain, kidneys and cornea. Clinical findings in Wilson's disease are complex and neurological symptoms such as tremor, dysarthria, rigid dystonia, seizures, psychiatric disorders, acute liver failure, chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis may develop. A 6-year-old patient underwent surgery for hip joint contractures. At the age of 2.5 years she was diagnosed with Wilson's disease and was treated with zinc sulfate and D-penicillamine. Spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine 0.5% was administered at the L3-L4 level. This patient was sedated with midazolam to provide spinal anesthesia. No complications occurred during the operation or in the postoperative period. We concluded that spinal anesthesia can be successfully administered in patients with Wilson's disease and that spinal anesthesia is preferable to general anesthesia because most anesthetics are metabolized by the liver and can exacerbate liver toxicity. Complication rates can be reduced to a minimum.",,"Pradeep Kumar, K.;Padmaja, K.;Subramanyam, G.;Muralidhar Rao, J.;Kishore, K.;Srinivas, P.;Jagadesh, G.",2010,September-October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AAP.0b013e3181f3582c,0,0,
1854,Elevated plasma copper/zinc ratios in patients with schizophrenia,"Introduction: Copper and zinc are neuroactive substances that can be synaptically released during neuronal activity. These metals have been linked to diseases with neuropsychopathological components, including Alzheimer's disease, Menkes disease, Wilson's disease, Pick's disease, stroke, seizure disorders, and schizophrenia. The purpose of the present study was to examine the plasma levels of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in schizophrenic patients and to compare the Cu/Zn ratios with those of matched healthy subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 40 patients with schizophrenia (35 men and 5 women; mean age 32.77 years) were examined together with 50 (41 men and 9 women; mean age 31.44 years) healthy controls. Exclusion criteria included another co-existing psychiatric disorder, pregnancy, and medical disorders or medications known to affect trace mineral metabolism. Fasting blood samples were taken from an antecubital vein between 07:00 and 09:00. Plasma copper and zinc levels were measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Two-tailed t-test was used to determine statistical differences. Differences were considered significant at the p<0.05 level. Results: Mean Cu or Zn levels and Cu/Zn ratios for each of the two groups are shown below: Cu (mug/dl) = 65 +/- 3 or 145 +/- 28, control and patients, respectively, p< 0.005 . Zn (Mug/dl) = 81 +/- 4 or 67 +/- 2, control or patient, p < 0.05. Cu/Zn ratio = 0.87 +/- 0.04 or 2.07 +/- 0.38, control or patient, p < 0.05. Conclusion: There was a significantly higher Cu/Zn ratio in schizophrenic patients compared to healthy subjects. These results suggest that Cu and Zn may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",,"Mansouri, N.;Farzin, D.",2010,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-1331.2010.03233.x,0,0,
1855,Gait disturbance in a patient with Wilson's disease 18 years after disease onset,"Aim: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting in excessive accumulation of copper in and outside the liver. A wide range of neurological symptoms, including dystonia, parkinsonian symptoms, cerebellar and bulbar signs, are very common and can severely impact the patient's quality of life. Although gait abnormality is a fairly prominent neurological sign in Wilson's disease, the characteristics of gait abnormalities have not been described in detail in the literature. We describe the gait disturbances in a patient who has been suffering from clinical signs of Wilson's disease for 18 years and has been treated with various anticopper drugs since the initial diagnosis in 1992. METHODS: This 51-year-old male patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at age 33 after a 2-year history of severe arm and head tremors, resulting in significant impairment of his ability to work. Irritable and aggressive behavior was present at the time of disease onset and worsened in the first few years after diagnosis. He reported a marked progression of symptoms after switching treatment from D-penicillamine to zinc sulfate in the late 1990s. Although D-penicillamine was reintroduced, gait has remained impaired since that time and the patient has been bound to a walker to adequately overcome his gait impairment. Recent urinalysis showed that copper was effectively eliminated with D-penicillamine. Results: On neurological examination, the patient presented with a complex gait disorder with features of severe (gait-specific) dystonia, gait apraxia, and freezing of gait (FOG). As he walked sideways along the wall, he used a simple clue to improve his walking disability. Otherwise, no significant impairment of leg motility or pronounced dystonia could be observed either sitting or lying down. Some frontal signs were positive in this patient, but pyramidal signs were absent. Conclusion: This is an illustrative case showing a specific pattern of gait disturbances with a combination of FOG and dystonia. While dystonia is well known in patients with Wilson's disease, FOG is uncommon and may reflect the involvement of various neuroanatomical structures beyond basal ganglia pathology.",,"Brugger, F.;Felbecker, A.;Kagi, G.;Hagele-Link, S.;Tettenborn, B.",2010,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00415-010-5575-7,0,0,
1856,Persistence with anti-copper treatment in patients with Wilson's disease,"Aim: Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism. Left untreated, it usually leads to death within several years of the onset of clinical symptoms. Medications that deplete copper should be continued throughout the patient's lifespan after diagnosis. Clinical observations show that patients with Wilson's disease frequently discontinue treatment. The aim of the study was to evaluate drug compliance (defined by us as persistence on treatment) in patients with Wilson's disease prescribed various anti-copper medications and to assess how this affects clinical outcomes improvement and general well-being. METHODS: Our study was based on a retrospective analysis of information from self-completion questionnaires given to patients at the Wilson Medical Center. The following data was collected from each patient: prescribed medication, duration of treatment, persistence of treatment, subjective assessment of the state of health. EQ-5D visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaire of well-being was also used. Results: A response was received from 120 subjects, but only 104 questionnaires could be used for further processing. Fifty-five percent of the patients were treated with D-penicillamine and the remainder with zinc sulfate. The mean duration of treatment was 10.3 (SD +/- 4.4) years. Our analysis revealed no differences in persistence with D-penicillamine or zinc sulfate treatment (75.0% vs. 73.0%) or in efficacy of the above drugs. However, we found that regardless of the medication used, persistence of drug therapy resulted in significantly better self-assessment scores: ""overall improvement"": 39.7% vs. 7.7% in the sustained vs. non-sustained group, p=0.003 ; ""partial improvement"": 53.8% vs. 30.8%, p=0.045; “Deterioration”: 0.0% vs. 42.3%, p<0.0001. Patients with ongoing treatment achieved higher VAS scores than non-persistent (76 vs. 67, p=0.05). Conclusion: Persistence of anti-copper treatment is an important factor affecting long-term clinical outcome in Wilson's disease.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Maselbas, W.;Chabik, G.;Czlonkowski, A.",2010,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00415-010-5575-7,0,1,
1857,Complex neuropsychiatric symptoms in juvenile Wilson's disease: The need for multidisciplinary care,"Aim: To describe the case of a young adult with Wilson's disease (WD) with severe neuropsychiatric illness that significantly impairs her quality of life. Advocate for early detection of these symptoms and multidisciplinary care. Background: WD is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper transport and metabolism, affecting 1 in 30,000 people. Children and young adults present to pediatric facilities predominantly because of hepatic dysfunction. A large number of these patients will have unrecognized and unreported comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms. Our center has developed a multidisciplinary team for the management of WD. This is a case that underscores the importance of this approach. Methods: Description of medical history, MR imaging, course of treatment, and clinical outcome. Results: A 19-year-old woman with a 9-year history of genetically proven MV treated with penicillamine was evaluated at our multidisciplinary MV clinic. Although she had stable liver disease on penicillamine, direct questioning revealed a significant two-year history of social anxiety and low mood. Psychiatric evaluation revealed paranoia. She had a slight tremor. Worsening depression led to hospitalization for psychiatric symptoms and antidepressant therapy with venlafaxine was initiated. While hospitalized, she developed Parkinson's and was started on Levo-Dopa. This has improved her movement disorder but she continues to require intensive psychiatric support. A multidisciplinary WD team, including hepatologists, neurologists and psychiatrists, has enabled the detection, appropriate diagnosis and prompt treatment of the patient's pronounced neuropsychiatric symptoms. Conclusions: Neuropsychiatric symptoms in children and young adults with MD are not uncommon. All clinicians treating children or adolescents with liver disease who have been diagnosed with WM must be evaluated for neuropsychiatric symptoms at diagnosis and during ongoing treatment. With a multidisciplinary approach, we are better able to identify previously undiagnosed comorbidities that require urgent intervention.",,"Hedderly, T.;Hinnell, C.;Moriarty, J.;Jarosz, J.;Hindley, P.;Dhawan, A.;Sherwood, R.;Samuel, M.",2010,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.23162,0,0,
1858,A retrospective study of the characteristics of Wilson's disease at the Institute of Tertiary Care in North India,"Objective: To study clinical profiles, laboratory findings, brain imaging in Wilson's disease and response to treatment. Background: Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive systemic disorder of copper metabolism due to a defect in copper transport through hepatic lysosomes with secondary pathology resulting from copper overload in the liver, brain, kidney, and skeletal system. METHODS: Cases of Wilson's disease were collected from hospital records from December 2004 to December 2009. A total of 32 cases were diagnosed. The study was conducted to see clinical features, the presence of a KF ring, laboratory parameters, biochemical values and brain imaging. Results: A total of 32 cases of Wilson's disease were diagnosed. 22 were male and 10 female. 28 cases were younger than 15 years and 4 were adults. The youngest patient was 6.5 years old and the oldest patient 32 years old at the time of diagnosis. The mean duration of disease before diagnosis was 6 months in children (< 15 years) and 2 years in adults (> 15 years). In children, the most common manifestation was dystonia (90%), parkinsonism (82.5%), both occurring in 73.4%, and tremor in 60%, and in adults, parkinsonism was the most common (75%), dystonia (50 %) and tremor were present in 50% of adult patients. Sialorrhea occurred in 60% of children and 25% of adult patients. Unclear voice was present in 80% of the cases. Dysphagia was present in 44% of children and 25% of adult patients. KF ring was missing in 3 children. Brain CT was performed in all cases, and the most common abnormality observed was bilateral symmetrical basal ganglia hyperlucency in 13 (40.6%). MRI brain performed in 24 cases. 4 had normal MRI brain. Anomalies were observed in 20 cases, the most frequent being hyperintensities of the basal ganglia (62.5%), the thalamus in 45% and the brainstem in 31.5%. 4 patients received only zinc and 28 both zinc and D-penicillamine. Of 28 cases, 10 gave up D-penicillamine (2 because of side effects and 8 because of unaffordability). All but one child responded excellently to treatment. Conclusions: Wilson's disease was more common in children. Dystonia, parkinsonism, tremor, sialorrhea, and slurred voice were the most common features. KF rings were present in 91% of cases. Bilateral symmetrical basal ganglia hyperintensities were the most common MRI anomaly. Zinc is safest to start with. Wilson's disease responds excellently to D-penicillamine.",,"Kumar, A.;Kumar, R.;Kumar, U.;Sharan, A.;Shahi, S. K.",2010,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.23162,0,1,
1859,Successful treatment of Wilson's dystonia with botulinum toxin,"Aim: To report a case of WD dystonia successfully treated with botulinum toxin A (BTA) injections. Background: Progressive hepatolenticular degeneration or Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene. The neurological symptoms primarily include akinetic-rigid and dystonic syndromes, tremor and ataxia. First described as a fatal neurological and hepatic familial disease, various drug therapies now exist. However, the treatment of WM with neurological symptoms is currently challenging. METHODS: A 38-year-old woman was diagnosed with 1985 WM. She was initially treated with penicillamine, which was switched to trientine in 1988 for a lupus-like syndrome. In 2007, she developed progressive Parkinson's disease and dystonia that required therapy with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and zinc. She improved clinically, but due to persistent bilateral leg dystonia, we tried botulinum toxin at a dose of 1000 U BTA (Dysport) in the bilateral extensor hallucis longus, flexor hallucis brevis, abductor hallucis, and abductor digiti quinti muscles under EMG guidance. Results: Two weeks later she noticed a functional improvement allowing the shoes to be worn comfortably and a reduction in symptoms with fewer spasms, pain relief and improvement in contractures. Two additional injections of 500 U BTA were given at four month intervals with good effect. No adverse event was reported. She is now neurologically stable. Conclusions: BTA injections into the affected muscles should be considered as a treatment option in the management of WD dystonia, which can be followed by marked functional improvement and a reduction in systemic drugs. In our patient, significant improvement started 2 weeks after the injections and lasted about 4 months.",,"De Fabregues, O.;Palasi, A.;Callen, A.;Hernandez-Vara, J.;Alvarez-Sabin, J.",2010,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.23162,0,0,
1860,Treatment of Wilson's disease with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate: experience in 3 cases with neurological symptoms,"Aim: Reports on our experiences with TTMo in WD. Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene. First described as a fatal neurological and hepatic familial disease, various drug therapies now exist. However, neurological deterioration and serious side effects have been reported with penicillamine and trientine, which require the use of other drugs such as ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TTMo). METHODS: These 3 patients with WD with neurological impairment were treated with TTMo 120 mg/day for 8 weeks. All patients were clinically assessed before and 6 months after treatment using the neurological subscale UWDRS and GAS for WD, video and neuroimage. Adverse drug events were evaluated by hematological and biochemical measurements and clinical follow-up. Results: Various reasons for TTMo treatment: neurological deterioration with penicillamine, intolerance to conventional treatment, and neurological presentation of WD. Efficacy: No patient had neurological deterioration. All patients showed clinical improvement with a mean UWDRS drop of 34 points (64% improvement) and 14 point GAS for WD (47% improvement). Well tolerated in 2 cases, treatment lasted 8 weeks longer in 1 case, 1 case had elevated transaminases leading to dose reduction and transient suppression. Improved neuroimaging in 2 cases. Subsequent clinical evolution: moderate neurological sequelae 2 and mild 1 case, 1 death unrelated to treatment. Conclusions: The treatment of WM with neurological symptoms is challenging. Of concern are penicillamine and trientine as first line treatment choices. TTMo is an effective, well-tolerated therapy alternative, even if the contraindications have to be clarified.",,"De Fabregues, O.;Palasi, A.;Gamez, J.;Callen, A.;Hernandez-Vara, J.;Duero, M.;Auge, C.;Alvarez-Sabin, J.",2010,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.23162,0,0,
1861,"Copper metabolism and hereditary copper transport disorders: molecular mechanisms, screening and treatment","In this review article, we discuss genetic disorders associated with altered copper metabolism, specifically related to Menkes disease (MD), occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and Wilson disease (WD). The genes responsible for MD and WD are ATP7A and ATP7B, respectively. Both proteins encoded by these genes are responsible for the transport of copper from the cytosol to the Golgi apparatus. However, the pathology of MD is completely different from that of WD, that is, MD is characterized by a copper deficiency, while WD is caused by a toxic copper excess. The reason for this difference is related to the particular cell types in which the ATP7A and ATP7B proteins are expressed. ATP7A is expressed in almost all cell types except hepatocytes, while ATP7B is mainly expressed in hepatocytes. MD and OHS are X-linked recessive disorders characterized by copper deficiency. Typical features of MD, such as neurological disorders, connective tissue disorders and hair anomalies, can be explained by the unusually low activity of copper-dependent enzymes. The current standard of care for MD is parenteral administration of copper histidine. If treatment is started in neonates before two months of age, neurological degeneration can be prevented, but delayed treatment is significantly less effective. In addition, copper histidine treatment does not improve symptoms of connective tissue disorders. Therefore, systems for mass screening of newborns for MD should be implemented. At the same time, novel treatments targeting connective tissue diseases need to be developed. OHS is a milder form of MD and is characterized by connective tissue abnormalities. Although no formal studies have been conducted for OHS, OHS patients are typically treated in a manner similar to that of patients with MD. WD is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the toxic effects of chronic exposure to high levels of copper. The liver and nervous systems are typically most affected. In addition, numerous other symptoms can be observed, which, however, make an early diagnosis difficult. Cheating agents and zinc are effective for the treatment of WD but are ineffective for patients with fulminant liver failure. Some patients with neurological disorders respond poorly to chelating agents; Again, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Screening newborns or infants for WD can aid in timely diagnosis and treatment. Patients with WD may be at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma despite treatment. Understanding the relationship between WM and hepatocellular carcinoma will provide clues to prevent hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with WM. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009.",,"Kodama, H.;Fujisawa, C.",2009,January,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b816011m,0,0,

1864,Systematic review: clinical efficacy of chelating agents and zinc in the initial treatment of Wilson's disease,"Background There is no consensus on the optimal initial treatment for Wilson's disease. Aim To systematically review the available literature on the treatment of newly presented patients with pre-symptomatic, hepatic, or neurological presentations of Wilson's disease. Methods A systematic literature search was carried out in the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and COCHRANE. Original studies on the clinical efficacy of d-penicillamine, trientine, tetrathiomolybdate, or zinc monotherapy as first-line treatment for Wilson's disease were included. A descriptive analysis of the relevant published data was performed. Results One randomized study and 12 observational studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies were quite heterogeneous and generally of low validity. However, according to currently available data, patients with hepatic Wilson's disease are probably most effectively treated with d-penicillamine. Zinc seems to be preferred over D-penicillamine for the treatment of pre-symptomatic and neurological patients, since in these subgroups the tolerability profile is in favor of zinc, while no obvious differences in clinical efficacy could be observed. Conclusions There is a lack of high-quality evidence to estimate the relative treatment effects of available drugs in Wilson's disease. Therefore, multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled comparative studies are required. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Wiggelinkhuizen, M.;Tilanus, M. E. C.;Bollen, C. W.;Houwen, R. H.

It has been shown to affect copper transport, resulting in hepatic accumulation and deposition in other organs, particularly the brain, kidneys, and cornea. leads. The worldwide prevalence of Wilson's disease is approximately 30 per million. About 60-70% of all cases are diagnosed between the ages of 8 and 20 years. Clinically, the condition can present with hepatic, neurological, or psychiatric disorders. Diagnosis is based on a high level of suspicion and on a combination of clinical and laboratory findings. The gold standard for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease is liver biopsy with determination of the hepatic copper level. Treatment is lifelong pharmacological therapy or liver transplantation. There are currently three drugs available, penicillamine and trientine (chelating agents) and zinc. Tetrathiomolybdate is another chelating agent that is still under investigation. The reproductive capacity of women with Wilson's disease has improved as these therapies have become more effective, and therefore pregnancy is becoming more common. It does not appear that the course of the disease is affected by pregnancy, but the problem of which therapy is most appropriate during pregnancy remains, as the safety of these drugs cannot be guaranteed during this period.

1870,Fulminant and subfulminant hepatitis: causes and treatment. [French],"Fulminant hepatitis is an emergency because the physician must within a few hours find the cause of the hepatitis (unidentified in 15 to 20% of cases), rule out a contraindication to liver transplantation, review the indication and prevent and/or those associated with liver failure treat complications. Viruses (particularly hepatitis viruses A and B), drugs, and toxins are the most common causes of fulminant hepatitis, with proportions varying by country. Hepatitis virus, the leading cause of 1995-1996, has fallen behind drugs and particularly paracetamol, which is now the leading cause of this disease in Europe and the United States. There are also other less common causes: other viruses (eg, herpesvirus HSV1 or 2, hepatitis virus E, parvovirus B19, and chickenpox herpes zoster), Wilson's disease, acute Budd-Chiari and Reyes syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, neoplastic infiltration of the Liver, hypoxic hepatitis, heat stroke, acute pregnancy-related steatosis and the HELLP syndrome. The prognosis is essentially determined by the neurological status, but is also very quickly influenced by damage to other organs. Liver transplantation has revolutionized the prognosis of fulminant hepatitis, increasing the survival rate from 10-20% (all causes combined) to 75-80% at 1 year and 70% at 5 years. These patients can only be treated in specialized centers with access to liver transplantation and various modern means of liver resuscitation (hypothermia, artificial liver support, albumin dialysis, monitoring of intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion, etc.) - all from the onset of the disease. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

1875,Genetics and treatment of dystonia,"Torsion dystonia includes a wide collection of etiological subtypes, often divided into primary and secondary classes. Tremendous progress has been made in uncovering the genetic basis of dystonia, including the discovery of a gene that causes early-onset primary torsional dystonia - a GAG deletion in exon 5 of the DYT1 gene, which codes for torsinA. Although the exact function of torsinA remains elusive, evidence points to an aberrant localization and interaction of the mutated protein; this can result in an abnormal response to stress or disruption of cytoskeletal events and neural pathway development in the brain. Breakthroughs include the discovery of a genetic modifier that protects against clinical expression in DYT1 dystonia and the identification of the gene that causes DYT6, THAP1. The authors address genetic etiologies and discuss phenotypes and counseling of patients regarding prognosis and course of the disease.

1878,The reduced expression of ATP7B caused by mutations causing Wilson's disease is rescued by the pharmacological folding chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate and curcumin,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive copper overload disorder of the liver and basal ganglia. WD is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes ATP7B, a protein localized in the trans-Golgi network that primarily facilitates hepatic copper excretion. Current treatment includes reducing circulating copper with zinc supplementation or copper chelation. Despite treatment, a significant number of patients experience neurological deterioration. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that defects arising from some WD mutations are ameliorated by drug treatment aimed at improving protein folding and restoring protein function. This required a systematic characterization of the molecular consequences of different ATP7B missense mutations associated with WD. With the exception of p.S1363F, all mutations tested (p.G85V, p.R778L, p.H1069Q, p.C1104F, p.V1262F, p.G1343V and p.S1363F) resulted in reduced ATP7B protein expression, while messenger RNA -Frequency was not affected. Retention of mutated ATP7B in the endoplasmic reticulum, increased protein expression, and normalization of localization after culturing the cells at 30 °C and homology modeling indicated that these proteins were misfolded. Four different mutations showed residual copper export capacity, while other mutations resulted in a complete disruption of copper export by ATP7B. Treatment with the pharmacological chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) and curcumin, a clinically approved compound, partially restored protein expression in most ATP7B mutants. Conclusion: These results could enable new treatment strategies in WD by directly enhancing protein expression from mutant ATP7B with residual copper export activity.

1884,Copper compounds in anticancer strategies,"Copper's chemical properties allow it to participate in many biological functions such as electron transfer, catalysis, and structure formation. The ability to switch between the +1 and +2 oxidation state is one of the properties that has been exploited by organisms throughout the evolutionary process. Because copper is potentially toxic to cells, a finely controlled mechanism for handling copper has also evolved. On the other hand, many copper complexes have been synthesized and tested for their anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. Their ability to kill cancer cells is mainly related to the induction of oxidative stress, but their ability to inhibit the proteasome, a protein complex whose proteolitic activity is required by several cellular processes, has recently been revealed. It has been generally described that the toxic effects of copper complexes result in cell death either through necrosis or through activation of the apoptotic process. There is growing evidence for the ability of some copper compounds to induce an alternative non-apoptotic form of programmed cell death. Since copper is essential for the formation of new blood vessels, angiogenesis, another antitumor approach based on the administration of copper sequestrants has been tried and its effectiveness is currently being evaluated through clinical trials. The proven importance of copper in angiogenesis, together with the marked sensitivity of several cancer cell lines to copper toxicity, opens a new perspective in anticancer strategy: exploiting tumor demand for copper to accumulate toxic levels of the metal in its cells. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",,"Tardito, S.;Marchio, L.",2009,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/092986709787846532,0,0,

1888,Wilson's disease: Two treatment modalities. Correlations to brain MRI before and after treatment,"INTRODUCTION: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in Wilson disease (WD) reveal a lack of correlations between neurological and imaging features. Long-term follow-up reports of sequential brain MRI in patients with neurological MD comparing different treatment modalities are scarce. METHODS: Eighteen patients with neurological WM underwent pre- and post-treatment brain MRI scans to assess the spectrum of abnormalities and evolution over these different time periods. All patients had at least two MRI scans at different intervals up to 11 years after the start of treatment. The MRI findings were correlated with the clinical picture, the clinical severity, the duration of the neurological symptoms and the treatment with two different drugs. The patients were divided into two groups depending on the treatment: D-penicillamine (DP), zinc (Zn) and Zn after the onset of severe intolerance to DP. Results: Pretreatment MRI scans showed hypersignal intensity lesions on T2- and proton-density-weighted images bilaterally and symmetrically at the basal nuclei, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and white matter of the brain in all patients. The most common neurological symptoms were: dysarthria, parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, psychiatric disorders, dysphagia, risus sardonicus, ataxia, chorea and athetosis. Conclusions: From a neurological point of view, there was no difference in development between the DP-only group and the Zn-treated group. Analysis of MRI scans with longer intervals after treatment initiation showed a trend for neuroimaging deterioration with no neurological concordance in Zn-treated patients. The developmental pattern of neuroimaging was more favorable for the group receiving DP alone. © 2009 Springer Verlag.",,"Leiros Da Costa, M. D. D.;Spitz, M.;Bacheschi, L. A.;Leite, C. C.;Lucato, L.

1889,Carlecortemcel-1: An ex vivo expanded cord blood cell graft for allogeneic transplantation,"Background: The success of cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is mainly influenced by the infused cell dose and its application is limited by the size of the recipient. For most adults and older children, it is not possible to find a single UCB unit large enough for a reliable transplant. One strategy to increase the number of available progenitor cells is ex vivo unit expansion. The main challenge of ex vivo expansion systems is not to deplete the self-renewing cell population by driving them into differentiation to committed progenitors. Objective: Copper modulates basic cell functions such as survival, proliferation and differentiation. The reduction of cellular copper under ex vivo culture conditions enabled preferential proliferation of early progenitors and increased engraftment abilities. The outcome of a phase I study of carlecortemcel-1, a product derived from the ex vivo expansion of UCB precursors in the presence of a copper chelator and early-acting cytokines, and the study design for the current pivotal study are presented. Methods: A literature search using PubMed and the manufacturer's investigator brochure. Conclusions: Early results suggest that carlecortemcel-1 infusion is safe and may be associated with favorable non-recurrence mortality rates.

1891,Anti-copper therapies in Alzheimer's disease: New concepts,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous and progressive neurodegenerative disease. The most recent metal hypothesis states that the interaction of amyloid beta (Abeta, the main component of senile plaques) with transition metals forms the basis of AD neurodegeneration. This hypothesis is based on in vitro studies showing that metals (copper, zinc) accelerate aggregation and precipitation in Abeta plaques, ultimately leading to synaptic dysfunction and accelerated amyloidogenesis. Recently, we have identified a specific marker of 'copper disease' in AD patients, consisting of an increase in serum copper not bound to ceruloplasmin, termed 'free' copper. Several patents have been issued and many clinical trials undertaken in recent years to search for an antimetallic effect that counteracts AD progression. Some of them have given very encouraging results. However, these antimetal agents have also shown side effects. This work aims to explore 'old' and 'new' attitudes towards the use of anticopper chelating agents or biological molecules that induce or perpetuate a state of copper malabsorption, such as 'old' clinical trials could open new avenues in planning 'modern ” hit. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",,"Squitti, R.;Zito, G.",2009,November,http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/157488909789104802,0,0,
1892,Pharmacological therapies for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia,"Severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which occurs mainly in neonates, can cause kernicterus and death. The conventional treatment for severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is phototherapy and exchange transfusion. However, phototherapy has several known disadvantages, while exchange transfusion is associated with significant morbidity and even mortality. These deleterious effects point to the need to develop alternative pharmacological treatment strategies for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. In general, these strategies aim to decrease the plasma concentration of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) by inhibiting its production, stimulating hepatic clearance, or disrupting the pigment's enterohepatic circulation. To be considered for routine clinical use, an alternative treatment strategy should be less invasive and at least as effective and safe as phototherapy. Several pharmacological therapies such as metalloporhyrins, clofibrate, bile salts, laxatives, and bilirubin oxidase may meet these criteria in the future, but none of them have been sufficiently evaluated to allow routine use. The aim of this review is to discuss the state of the art and future perspectives in the pharmacological treatment of neonatal jaundice. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",,"Cuperus, F. J.

1893,Drug development for rare diseases within the framework of personalized medicine,"Rare diseases are diseases that are detected in fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States, which is the limit on the number of patients for a drug to be viable. Because there are many thousands of rare diseases in total (about 20 to 30 million Americans have rare diseases), these patients are excluded from drug development by the pharmaceutical industry. Orphan drugs are a big part of personalized medicine. The rare diseases are often so rare that a doctor may only see 1 case a year or less. The right treatment is therefore a personal encounter between doctor and patient. Academic medical professionals have attempted to fill this therapeutic vacuum by working to develop orphan drugs. But there are many disincentives, including career disincentives, lack of funding, and the multiple specialties that are required. Positive developments include the creation of the National Organization for Rare Diseases, the Orphan Drug Act, the development of a grants program to fund the development of orphan drugs, the creation of the National Institutes of Health Office of Rare Diseases, and the passage of the orphan drugs - Legislation by other countries. Progress has increased, but the 300 drugs and devices approved for orphan diseases over the past 25 years are still a drop in the bucket compared to the many thousands of rare diseases. I think we have to do better. I will present my own 2 examples of the positives and negatives of orphan drug development and end this article with recommendations on how we might succeed in both developing more orphan drugs and saving the pharmaceutical industry from its impending economic collapse . © 2009 Mosby, Inc.

1894,Metal chelators coupled with nanoparticles as potential therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive and irreversible memory loss, followed by complete dementia. Despite the high prevalence of the disease and the great economic and social burden, an explanatory etiology or viable cure is not available. Great efforts have been made to better understand the pathogenesis of the disease and to develop more effective therapeutics. However, success is severely hampered by the presence of the blood-brain barrier, which prevents a large number of potential therapeutics from entering the brain. Nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery is one of the few valuable tools to overcome this obstacle, and its application as a potential AD treatment shows promise. In this review, the current studies on nanoparticle delivery of chelating agents as potential therapeutics for AD are discussed, as several metals are found in abundance in the AD brain and may play a role in disease development. In particular, a novel approach involving delivery of iron chelators into and out of the brain by nanoparticles is highlighted. This approach may provide a safer and more effective means of simultaneously reducing multiple toxic metals in the AD brain. It may also provide insight into the mechanisms of AD pathophysiology and prove useful in the treatment of other iron-associated neurodegenerative diseases such as Friedreich's ataxia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome. It is important to note that the use of nanoparticle-mediated delivery to facilitate toxin clearance from diseased sites in the body may advance nanoparticle technology, which is currently focused on targeted drug delivery for disease prevention and treatment. The application of nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery in the treatment of AD is still at a very early stage of development and further studies are warranted.

1897,Hypoglycemia and endocrine effects of inborn errors of metabolism in adults. [French],"Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are rare diseases that are usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. They can be associated with endocrine dysfunction, the most common being disorders of carbohydrate metabolism (hypoglycemia, diabetes). The endocrinologist could be prompted to study these complications in a patient diagnosed in childhood. In some rare cases, it should provoke the diagnosis of an endocrine disorder, most often associated with multisystemic involvement. This distribution area is new and not very well known in adulthood. The long-term effects of IEM on fertility and bone metabolism are poorly understood. The diagnostic orientation relies on some specific laboratory tests, which include blood lactate, free fatty acids and 3-hydroxybutyrate, ammoniaemia, carnitine and acylcarnitines, amino acid and organic chromatography in urine. Hyperinsulinism, glycogenosis, fatty acid S-oxidation, disorders of the carnitine cycle and glycosylation (CDG syndrome), fructose intolerance, tyrosinemia, organic aciduria can explain hypoglycemia. This diagnosis should be made before unexplained hypoglycemia in adults. Diabetes is related to iron overload, mitochondriopathy and thiamine-sensitive diabetes. Clinical spectrum of some forms of IEM transition from childhood hypoglycemia to adult diabetes. Mitochondriopathies can be associated with all types of endocrine disorders, the most common being diabetes and dysthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurs with mitochondriopathies, cystinosis, and primary hyperoxaluria. Hypogonadism is almost constant in galactosemia, common in CDG syndromes, cystinosis, and iron overload.

The immediate mechanisms responsible for neurodegeneration are unknown. Copper ions may play a role in Huntington's disease by promoting oligomerization of expanded polyglutamine repeat protein fragments. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate is a copper complexing agent with demonstrated safety and efficacy in another neurodegenerative disorder, Wilson's disease. We evaluated ammonium tetrathiomolybdate in the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease. Treatment with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate delayed the onset of motor dysfunction in R6/2 mice. There was a trend towards reduced striatal degeneration, suggesting a neuroprotective effect of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate in this model. Given its known tolerability in people with neurodegeneration, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate could be considered as a candidate for clinical trials in Huntington's disease.",,"Tallaksen-Greene, S.

1902,Chelation therapy in neurodegenerative diseases,"growing body of evidence points to a central role of transition biometals in the etiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (ND). Indeed, as the molecular basis of this heterogeneous group of diseases was investigated, it became increasingly clear that biometals and nonphysiological Al are often involved in the onset and progression of pathology, either by influencing the conformation of specific proteins or by enhancing local oxidative stress. The apparently critical role played by metal dishomeostasis in ND makes chelation therapy an attractive pharmacological option. However, classical metal chelation approaches based on potent metal ligands have proven successful only in the rare cases where extraordinary metal accumulation in the brain occurs due to specific defects in metal metabolism. In contrast, metal-focused approaches with intermediate-strength ligands appear more appropriate to combat the large ND, although their benefits are still being questioned. We report here an overview of recent evidence supporting the use of a variety of metal ligands and even functionalized nanoparticles for the treatment of the most common ND. The beneficial neuropharmacological effects of metal-targeting agents most likely result from local metal redistribution rather than massive metal removal. The perspectives for the development of new drugs against ND are critically discussed. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Bolognin, S.;Drago, D.;Messori, L.;Zatta, P.",2009,July,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/med.20148,0,0,
1903,Long-term exclusive zinc monotherapy in symptomatic Wilson's disease: experience in 17 patients,"Exclusive monotherapy with zinc in symptomatic Wilson's disease is controversial. Seventeen symptomatic patients with Wilson's disease were treated with zinc alone. The median age at diagnosis and initiation of treatment was 18 years (range 13-26), with approximately half being adolescents. Presentation was hepatic only, neurological only, and combined in seven, five, and five patients, respectively. The median follow-up was 14 years (range 2-30). At baseline, two of the 12 patients with liver disease had decompensated cirrhosis, five had compensated cirrhosis, and five had less severe disease. Both patients with decompensated cirrhosis improved to a compensated state after initiation of therapy. Two of the five patients with initially compensated cirrhosis achieved a decompensated state and three remained stable. Three of the five patients with moderate or mild liver disease remain stable and two have improved. Apart from falling bilirubin levels, there were no significant changes in liver biochemistry or function during long-term follow-up. Nine out of 10 neurological patients improved significantly and one worsened. Two patients with an exclusively neurological presentation developed liver disease during zinc treatment. Two patients with exclusively hepatic presentation developed mild neurological symptoms. According to 24-hour urinary copper excretions (213 +/- 38 versus 91 +/- 23 +/- cup: P = 0.01) and serum concentrations of copper not bound to ceruloplasmin (11 +/- 2 versus 7 = 1 cup / dL: P = 0.1) at the end of follow-up, the effectiveness of decoppering was lower in the exclusively hepatic group than in the neurological group. The prescribed dose of zinc and 24-hour urinary zinc excretions tended to be lower in the hepatic-only group. Conclusion: The outcome of exclusive zinc therapy in neurological disorders is generally good. A less satisfactory outcome in liver disease may be related to less efficient decoppering.

Results: For 7 essential trace elements (Cr, Fe, Co, Se, Mn, Cu and Zn), the concentrations of Mn, Cu and Zn in the 24-hour urine of the WD group were significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0 .05 , P<0.01 and P<0.01). For 12 non-essential trace elements (As, Be, Al, V, Ni, Cd, Sb, Ba, Pb, Ti, Th, and U), the concentration of As in the 24-hour urine of the WD group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). For 2 macroelements (Ca and Mg), the 24-hour urine Ca concentration of the WD group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.001).

1905,"Chiral Toxicology: It's the same, just different","Chiral substances have a unique architecture such that they cannot be superimposed despite having identical molecular formulas, atom-to-atom connectivity, and bond distances. Therefore, in the environment of living systems where specific structure-activity relationships may be required for an effect (e.g. enzymes, receptors, transporters and DNA), the physiochemical and biochemical properties of racemic mixtures and individual stereoisomers can be significantly different. In drug development, enantiomeric selection to maximize clinical effects or reduce drug toxicity has led to both success and failure. Further aggravating genetic polymorphisms in drug disposition, the stereoselective metabolism of chiral compounds can additionally affect pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity. Optically pure pharmaceuticals can undergo racemization in vivo, thereby negating the advantages of individual enantiomers or inducing unexpected effects. Appropriate chiral antidotes must be selected for therapeutic benefit and to minimize adverse events. Enantiomers can have different carcinogenicity and teratogenicity. Environmental toxicology provides several examples where the bioaccumulation, persistence, and toxicity of compounds exhibit a chiral dependency. In forensic toxicology, chiral analysis has been applied to illicit drug preparations and biological samples, with the potential to aid in determining cause of death and aid in the correct interpretation of drug abuse and ""doping"" screenings. Adrenergic agonists and antagonists, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, SSRIs, opioids, warfarin, valproate, thalidomide, retinoic acid, N-acetylcysteine, carnitine, penicillamine, leucovorin, glucarpidase, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, phenylethylamines, and more compounds are discussed to illustrate important concepts in the "" chiral toxicology"". © The Author 2009.

PATIENTS & METHODS: Clinical and laboratory findings from 71 patients with WM; The mean +/- SD age at presentation was 16.8 +/- 10.7 (range: 2-49) years; 40 (56.3%) were men; referred to our center were reviewed and analyzed. Results: The main manifestations of WD were hepatic, neurological and mixed in 39 (54.9%), 14 (19.7%) and 18 (25.4%) patients, respectively, and 11 (15.5%) of them were asymptomatic cases discovered by family screening. Family history of WD was positive in 41 (57.7%) patients and parental consanguinity was positive in 26 (36.6%) patients. Kayser-Fleiser ring (KFR) was absent, equivocal, and present in 32 (45.1%), 3 (4.2%), and 36 (50.7%), respectively. KFR was positive in 10 (71.4%), 11 (28.2%), and 15 (83.3%) of patients with neurological, hepatic, and mixed features, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 92.2 +/- 72.9 (range: 1-320) months. The mean age at the end of follow-up was 25.3 +/- 12 (range: 4-62) years. A hepatoma was discovered in 5 (7%) patients. Penicillamine therapy was used by 58 (81.7%) patients, while zinc and trientine were used by 32 (45.1) and 11 (15.5%) patients, respectively. Sixteen (22.5%) patients underwent liver transplantation. and one died (1.4%) on the waiting list. Ten (14.1%) patients died during follow-up, while 45 (63.4) and 16 (22.5%) are still in follow-up or no longer being followed-up. Liver status remained stable or improved in 35 (49.3%) and neurological status showed improvement in 11 (34.4%) of the 32 patients with neurological involvement. Conclusions: This is the largest cohort reported from the Middle East. WD presentation and result of WD are very different.

1909,Long-term exclusive zinc monotherapy in symptomatic Wilson's disease: experience in 17 patients,"Although zinc inhibits intestinal copper absorption in Wilson's disease, its use as sole therapy is controversial, particularly in symptomatic patients. We treated 17 symptomatic Wilson patients with zinc alone. Presentation was hepatic only, neurologic only, and combined in 7, 5, and 5 pts. Median follow-up was 14 years (range 2-30). Liver disease was classified as: decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B/C), compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), moderate (abnormal liver biochemistry and radiology, no cirrhosis), or mild (abnormal liver biochemistry only). The mean elemental zinc dose was 147 +/- 12 mg/day (range 67-270) at baseline and 199 +/- 20 mg/day (90-360) at the end of follow-up (p = 0.03), with no differences between the different presentation modes. Side effects were rare, except for gastrointestinal discomfort. Reversible agranulocytosis occurred in a patient who was taking concomitant antiepileptic drugs. Of 12 patients with initial liver disease, 2 had decompensated cirrhosis at baseline, and both improved to a compensated state after initiation of zinc treatment. Two of 5 patients with initially compensated cirrhosis developed at 16 and 18 years, respectively, and 3 remain stable. Three out of 5 patients with moderate or mild liver disease remain stable and 2 improved. Two of 5 patients with only neurological presentations at baseline developed moderate liver disease and compensated cirrhosis after 4 and 5 years of treatment, respectively. In the liver group, there were no significant changes in liver biochemistry or function apart from improved bilirubin levels. Neurological symptoms improved significantly in 9 out of 10 patients in the neurological group and worsened in 1 patient. Brain MRI improved in 4 cases, remained stable in 4, and worsened in 2 cases. Elevated serum free copper levels normalized within one year (<0.15 mg/l) zinc in 15/17 patients, with no difference between hepatic or neurological patients. In contrast, adequate 24-hour urinary copper excretion was achieved more frequently in neurological than in hepatic patients (<100 µg/24 hours at the end of follow-up in 5/5 neurological patients only, 2/5 patients with combined presentation, but only 1/ 7 points with exclusive hepatic presentation). 24-hour urinary copper excretion (mean +/- SEM) in neurological vs. hepatic-only patients was 494 +/- 167 vs. 1,149 +/- 798 (median 390 vs. 405) at baseline, 157 +/- 29 vs. 256 +/- 46 at 1 year and 100+/-25 vs. 225 +/- 37 cups/24 hours (P < 0.01) at the end of follow-up. Conclusions: The outcome of zinc therapy alone in neurological disorders is generally satisfactory. Although even decompensated cirrhosis can significantly improve with this treatment, liver disease can also worsen, possibly related to less efficient decoppering in liver patients.",,"Linn, F.;Houwen, R.;Van Hattum, J.;Van Erpecum, K.

1910,Role of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and copper in cancer: effect on the COX-2 signaling pathway,"Background & Aim: Copper is a trace element that has been associated with cancer for a number of years; however, its exact role in cancer is still a matter of debate. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate(TM) is a drug that was developed to treat Wilson's disease and is being studied because it appears to have an important effect on cancer. To date, TM is known to downregulate VEGF, IL-1alpha and IL-8 from clinical studies and animal models, but few have been performed in vitro to try to elucidate its effects and mechanisms of action. In this study, we determined the effects of TM and copper on the known cancer-related cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) signaling pathway. Methods: The gastric adenocarcinoma cell line MKN45 and the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma TTn; corresponding to the two leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide were used in this study. These cells were treated with TM and copper, and their viability and chemosensitivity were assessed using the non-radioactive MTS/PMS method. COX-2 mRNA expression was assessed by RT and real time PCR and protein expression by Western blot. PGE2 was assessed by ELISA. Results & Discussion: Increasing concentrations of copper reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, which translates as stress and eventual toxicity to the cells. Simultaneously, there was an increase in the COX-2 signaling pathway, which was determined by an increase in COX-2 mRNA (up to 4.5-fold) and protein (up to 2.5-fold), followed by an increase in PGE<inf>2</inf>. For the first time we show that high concentrations of TM do not cause toxicity to cell lines other than breast cancer. In addition, TM downregulated the COX-2 signaling pathway in TTn. Despite the opposing effects of copper and TM on COX-2, treatment with both showed greater regulation of COX-2 than that caused by copper alone. Conclusions: Excess copper (besides its requirement for angiogenesis) may play a role in cancer as it induces stress and toxicity and upregulates the COX-2 pathway. Here we describe that TM is non-toxic in vitro, just as it was previously described in vivo. TM is able to downregulate the COX-2 pathway under normal cell culture conditions; However, TM was unable to reduce COX-2 upregulation caused by excess copper. This leads us to believe that a) TM may be useful in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal cancers, b) TM appears to have a biochemical mechanism distinct from simple copper chelation, and c) this mechanism is likely through excess Copper binding the TM is inhibited. making it unavailable and biologically inactive.",,"Sanchez-Siles, A.

1911,Comparative study of morning urinary copper to zinc ratio and 24-hour urinary copper excretion for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in children,"Background and Objectives: Although 24-hour urinary copper excretion is valuable for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, accurate, timed collection presents practical difficulties. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic value of morning urine copper to zinc ratio (copper/zinc) and 24-hour urinary copper excretion in children with Wilson's disease (WD). METHODS: From July 2005 to June 2007, morning and 24-hour urine was collected from 96 patients admitted to a pediatric tertiary hospital for evaluation of liver disease. Each patient was re-evaluated according to the WD scoring system and assigned to one of three groups: WD, suspected WD, and non-WD. Thus, 24, 6 and 64 cases were assigned to each group. Urinary copper and zinc concentrations were determined simultaneously by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results: Morning urine copper/zinc ratio and 24-hour urinary copper excretion correlated well (r=0.758, P<0.001). Morning urine copper/zinc ratio was significantly higher in the WD group than in the non-WD group (median 0.370 vs vs 24.2, z-score -6.208, P=0.000).

1912,Comparison of urinary copper/zinc ratio to 24-hour urinary copper excretion for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in children: a prospective study,"Background: Although 24-hour urinary copper excretion is valuable for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD), accurate, timed collection presents practical difficulties. In a preliminary study, we found that the copper/zinc ratio (Cu/Zn) in morning urine appears to be a promising surrogate parameter. This study aims to compare its diagnostic value to 24-hour urinary copper excretion for WD in children with hepatic manifestations. METHODS: From July 2005 to June 2007, 24-hour urine and morning urine samples were collected from consecutive liver patients over three years of age admitted to our department. Each patient was scored independently by two pediatricians using the WD scoring system, incorporating clinical data and routine laboratory results. The ATP7B gene was sequenced in patients with acute liver failure or a WD score between 2 and 3, and therefore each child was assigned to a WD or non-WD group. Copper and zinc concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry by a technician without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis. SPSS was used for data analysis. RESULTS: 94 patients, including 26 WM cases and 68 non-WM cases, from whom both the morning urine sample and the 24-hour urine sample were correctly collected were included. 14 of them were grouped by combining the clinical data and the genetic study. Morning urine Cu/Zn ratio and 24-hour urine copper excretion correlated well (r=0.758, P=0.000). The morning urine Cu/Zn ratio was significantly higher in the WD group (median 0.37, range 0.07-12.74) than in the non-WD group (median 0.05, range 0.01-12.74). 1.23, Z=-6.502, P=0.000); also the 24-hour Cu/Zn ratio (WD group, median 0.39, range 0.04-10.7; non-WD group, median 0.06, range 0.00-0.45; Z=-6.020, P=0.000) and 24-hour urinary copper excretion (WD group, median 87.1 µg, range 18.3-1180.5 µg; non-WD group, median 24.2 µg , range 1.4-357.9 µg; Z = -6.208, P = 0.000). There was no significant difference in 24-hour zinc excretion between two groups (WD group, median 399 µg, range 17-1641 µg; non-WD group, median 359 µg, range 6.4-7287 µg; Z = - 2.100, P=0.834). The area under the ROC curve was comparable between morning urine Cu/Zn ratio, 24-hour urine Cu/Zn ratio, and 24-hour copper excretion, with median and 95% CI 0.953 (0.909-0.998), 0.977 (0.834-0.897) and 0.934 (0.867-1,000), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of morning urine Cu/Zn ratio were 90.9%, 79.7%, 62.9% and 96.2% at a cutoff value of 0.1 and 81.8%, 95.3%, 87% and 93.8%. each with a cutoff of 0.2.

1913,The diagnostic value of the ratio of copper to zinc in the morning urine in children with Wilson's disease,"Aims: To compare the diagnostic value of morning urinary copper to zinc (copper/zinc) ratio and 24-hour urinary copper excretion in children with Wilson's disease (WD). METHODS: Morning urine and 24-hour urine were collected from 96 patients over three years of age admitted to a tertiary pediatric liver service. Each patient was re-evaluated according to the WD scoring system and assigned to one of three groups: WD, suspected WD, and non-WD. 24, 6 and 64 cases were assigned to WD with suspected WD and non-WD, respectively. Urine copper and zinc concentrations were determined simultaneously by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results: Morning urine copper/zinc ratio and 24-hour urinary copper excretion correlated well (r = 0.758, P < 0.001). The median of morning urine copper/zinc ratio, 24-hour urine copper/zinc ratio, 24-hour urine copper excretion, and 24-hour urine zinc excretion was 0.370; WD group and The differences in morning urine copper/zinc ratio, 24-hour urine copper/zinc ratio, and 24-hour copper excretion were significant (Z-score -6.502, -6.020, and -6.208, respectively , all p-values < 0.000).

1914,Reassessment of diagnostic criteria for Wilson's disease in a cohort of predominantly asymptomatic children,"Wilson disease (WD) is a difficult diagnosis, especially in children. Prompt diagnosis is required to avoid progression of the disease. AIM: To reevaluate conventional diagnostic criteria and the diagnostic Ferenci score [1] in children with WM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 43 children with MB (28 boys, mean age 6.1 years, range 1.1–20.9) and 58 with liver disease other than MB (36 boys, mean age 7.1 years, range 2– 16). Among the WM children, 35 (81%) were asymptomatic (30 with isolated hypertransaminasemia, 5 detected by familial screening). Cupruria was scored before (basal Cupruria [BCu]) and after (penicillamine challenge test Cupruria [PCTCu]) penicillamine 500 mg po 12 hourly x 2<0.0001 and P<0.03, respectively). The ROC analysis for ceruloplasmin at a cut-off of <= 20 mg/dl showed a sensitivity of 95.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84.5-99.4%) and a specificity of 84.4 % (95% CI, 72.5-92.6%). At a cut-off of <= 10 mg/dL, sensitivity and specificity were 65.9% (95% CI, 50-79.5%) and 96.5% (95% CI, 88-99.6%), respectively. A BCu threshold of >=100 µg/24h showed a sensitivity of 65.8% (95% CI, 49.4-79.9%) and a specificity of 98.2% (95% CI, 90.7- 99.9%), whereas at >=40 µg/24 h sensitivity was 78% (95% CI, 62.4-89.4%) and specificity was 87.9% (95% CI, 76.7 -95%). The ROC range for PCTCu was not significant (AUC 0.63, p=0.051) and in our cohort this test showed a sensitivity of only 15.4% (95% CI, 4.3-34.8%) and a specificity of 94.8% (95% CI, 85.6–98.9%). Finally, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the Ferenci score [1]: at the proposed score of >=4, the sensitivity was 96.7% (95% CI, 83.3-99.9%) and the specificity was 93.3% (95%CI, 77.9-99.1). %), with a ROC area of 0.95, P<0.0001. Conclusions: The diagnostic accuracy of ceruloplasmin and BCu, considered as individual tests, is high in a cohort of mostly asymptomatic children with WD. We have observed optimal sensitivity and specificity for BCu with a cut-off value of >= 40 µg/24 h as recommended by recent guidelines. Instead, we do not recommend routinely measuring PCTCu in asymptomatic children due to its low sensitivity. Our observations confirm that WD diagnosis is multi-level, as evidenced by the high accuracy of the diagnostic scoring system.",,"Nicastro, E.;Ranucci, G.;Cirillo, F.;Vegnente, A.;Vajro, P.;Iorio, R.",2009,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1590-8658%2809%2960497-7,0,0,
1915,An adolescent suffering from Wilson's disease: presentation with hemolytic anemia and good response to zinc acetate monotherapy,"previously healthy 17-year-old woman was evaluated at a local hospital for developing jaundice. She showed a decrease in Hb levels (to 5.4 g/dl), bilirubin levels of 10.2 mg/dl (directly 2.9 mg/dl), thrombocytopenia (125,000/mm<sup>3</sup>) , increased INR 1.64 (0.7 -1.1), decreased ATIII, AST/ALT 92/38 U/L, albumin 2.5 g/dL. Direct and indirect Coombs tests were negative and fragmented erythrocytes were found in the peripheral blood smear. She was treated with transfusions. On admission to our institute, the girl showed moderate hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia was confirmed: coagulation screening revealed a PT ratio of 1.63 (0.84-1.16) and a PTT ratio of 1.44 (0.80-1.21) and decreased coagulation factors (II , V, VII, X) and antithrombin consistent with liver disease. Infectious diseases were ruled out and autoimmune tests were negative. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed an increased liver volume with an inhomogeneous echo structure. Cupreum was 107 µg/dL (85-165), ceruloplasmin was 9.2 mg% (18-70), and the Kayser-Fleischer ring was present at 360 degrees. The suspicion of MM was confirmed by the diagnostic scoring system of Ferenci [1], which considered MM to be very probable with a score of 5. A liver biopsy was not performed because of the coagulation values. The patient received treatment with zinc acetate (25 mg 3 times a day). The 11-month follow-up showed an improvement in clinical and laboratory data (PT 80%; PTT 34 sec (23-38), INR 1.16, ATIII 94.4% (80-120). A genetic analysis for mutations in ATP7B was planned.Most experience with Wilson's treatment of the disease in symptomatic patients has relied on the use of chelating agents.In contrast, a theory that is gaining ground suggests that the pathogenesis of Wilson's disease is more related to free copper in the plasma considered to be related to the accumulation of the element in body tissues, therefore the aim of treatment is to normalize the concentration of free copper in the blood zinc, which induces the production of metallothionein, which selectively binds to copper in the cells of the intestinal mucosa, prevents copper absorption The traditional therapy used is based on zinc sulfate, zinc acetate has fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Our patient has the choice of therapy with zinc acetate has had good results as first-line treatment. The same response was reported in a case of decompensated cirrhosis that improved after zinc sulfate monotherapy [2].",,"Marazzi, M.

1916,Zinc vs. d-penicillamine treatment in children with Wilson's disease and liver presentation,"Background: Zinc-based drugs appear to be as effective as D-penicillamine in the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease, but there is very limited data on efficacy in patients with hepatic symptoms. The aim of the study was to compare the effects of zinc vs. D-penicillamine treatment in a retrospective analysis of pediatric patients with Wilson's disease and liver presentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 27 children with Wilson's disease before and after one year of treatment (14 pts aged 11.7 +/- 3.3 years received zinc and 13 pts aged 13.4 +/- 3 2 years received d-penicillamine) in which the therapy was not changed during the observation period. Wilson's disease was diagnosed according to the method of Ferenci et al. diagnosed. Scoring system and mutation analysis exam. Patients with acute and fulminant liver failure were excluded from this study. Results: Before treatment, ALT levels were slightly lower in zinc patients than in penicillamine patients (114+/-105 IU/L vs. 197+/-120 IU/L, mean +/- SD). We found no difference in AST, INR and GGTP between the groups at baseline. After one year of treatment, there was no difference in ALT levels between the zinc and penicillamine groups (56 +/- 22 IU/L and 50 +/- 18 IU/L, respectively), but the fall in ALT levels was significant (p<0.05) in the penicillamine patients but not in the zinc patients. AST activity decreased significantly in both groups. Conclusions: Penicillamine induces a greater decrease in ALT levels than zinc therapy and may therefore be more effective in children with Wilson's disease and liver presentation.",,"Janczyk, W.;Dadalski, M.;Schmidt, H.;Houwen, R.;Socha, P.",2009,June,,0,1,
1917,Diagnosis and treatment problems in myeloneuropathy associated with copper deficiency,"Background: Copper deficiency is a rare but under-recognized cause of myelopolyneuropathy. We present a case co-existing with B<inf>12</inf> deficiency and discuss diagnostic and management challenges. First blood tests showed low B<inf>12</inf>/folate levels. The ataxia progressed despite monthly intramuscular replacement therapy. Further investigation confirmed hypocuremia and low ceruloplasmin levels with normal serum zinc. The MRI brain showed little ischemia. MRI spine was normal. The neurophysiology showed an axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Imaging, normal noninvasive liver tests, normal 24-hour urine copper, and the absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings ruled out Wilson's disease. Treatment with oral copper picolinate resulted in no significant clinical change. The cause of the copper deficiency remains unclear. Discussion: The largest series (13 patients) on this topic describes typical clinical features and in these cases substitution with copper stopped the clinical deterioration. It is important to rule out Wilson's disease, which may have similar serum copper readings. Supplementation should be done with a zinc-free preparation, as zinc impedes copper absorption. Copper deficiency should be considered in patients with myeloneuropathy, even with low B<inf>12</inf>. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent neurological deterioration.",,"Chowdhury, F.

1918,Obesity and Wilson's disease in childhood and adolescence,"Background and Aim: Obesity in childhood and adolescence often leads to elevated transferases and fatty liver and is thought to be associated with elevated acute-phase proteins. However, steatosis also occurs in a variety of childhood metabolic diseases, including Wilson's disease. An algorithm for detailed differential diagnosis would be valuable. Methods: A retrospective analysis of data from 291 obese (body mass index greater than 97 percentile) children and adolescents who attended liver or obesity outpatient clinics in the past 6 years (2003-2008) was performed. Standard and laboratory anthropometric parameters, virology, haptoglobin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and serum ceruloplasmin were analyzed. Penicillamine challenge testing was performed in 22 patients and 14 liver biopsies in patients with elevated transferases despite attempted weight loss (except in emergencies). Genetic analysis and slit lamp examination were performed. Results: 41 (14.08%) patients had elevated transferases. Mean ceruloplasmin (normal range 0.220-0.605 g/L) was 0.263 g/L (0.139-0.388 g/L); 9/41 (22%) of the subjects had values below the reference range. 22 patients had a penicillamine challenge test with mean values of 19 mg, 698 mg, 802 mg and 819 mg on days 1-4. 13 children had values in the middle range of 800-1590mg, 2 tests had values above 1590mg. Liver histology showed steatosis in 8, steatohepatitis in 1, fibrous changes in 4 and cirrhosis in 2 patients. We detected 2 cases of Wilson's disease in this group by following a tiered approach. In addition, 3 other asymptomatic homozygous relatives with Wilson's disease and 4 heterozygous carriers were identified. In view of the problems in diagnosing Wilson's disease, we present an algorithm for the systematic search for the disease in obese children with elevated liver enzymes. Contrary to the current pediatric literature, we cannot confirm the observation of elevated acute phase proteins (C-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin and alpha-1-antitrypsin) in obese children and adolescents. Conclusions: Currently, there are insufficient data to predict the incidence of Wilson's disease in obese children with liver disease. Our data suggest a higher incidence than currently estimated. All children or adolescents with liver disease should be evaluated extensively for Wilson disease. Early diagnosis should aim to provide early therapy before the development of irreversible organic damage.",,"Spindelbock, W.;Spindelboeck, W.;Deutschmann, A.;Lackner, K.;Weitzer, C.;Erwa, W.;Hauer, A.;Ferenci, P.;Deutsch, J.",2009,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181aa06ea,0,0,
1919,Evaluation of the Efficacy of D-penicillamine Therapy in Children with Wilson's Disease,"Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of prolonged D-penicillamine therapy in children with Wilson's disease. METHODS: We studied 53 children with Wilson's disease aged 6 to 17 years (mean age 12 years). Boys 25 (47%), girls 28 (53%). Forty-one (77%) children were diagnosed with a hepatic form of the disease and 12 (27%) children with a mixed form. All children received D-penicillamine therapy, the mean dose was 17.87 mg/kg/day. We examined changes in liver size, serum transaminase levels (ALT, AST) and urinary excretion of copper during a prolonged course of therapy with D-penicillamine (Cuprenil). Results: Before the start of treatment, 21 (39.6%) children had an enlarged liver (0.5–2 cm from the costal arch), including 3 (14%) children with mixed Wilson's disease. Liver size decreased in all children during treatment, liver size normalized in 15 (28%) children. The mean serum ALT level before the start of therapy was 112.8 UI/L (normal 5-40), in 6 months of therapy 44 UI/L, during the next 5 years it fluctuated from the minimum (23.7 UI/L ) to the maximum (76.6 UI). /L), the mean value was 44.8 UI/L. The mean serum AST level at baseline was 79.74 UI/L (normal 5-42), at 6 months 42.14 UI/L, at 5 years 31 UI/L. The urinary excretion of copper before the start of therapy was 286 mg/day (normal to 50 mg/day), in the D-penicillamine challenge test 1961 mg/day (normal 600-800). This value was 971.5 mg/day after 6 months of therapy, 965 mg/day after 1 year, 685.4 mg/day after 2 years, and 524 mg/day after 5 years. In one year, the average copper excretion in the urine fell to the upper normal limit and then did not exceed 700 mg/day during a 5-year observation period. Conclusions: Positive changes were registered in all children during therapy with D-penicillamine (cuprenil): liver size was reduced; the serum transaminase level and the urinary excretion of copper were reduced.",,"Zubovich, A.;Strokova, T.;Kaganov, B.;Pavlovskaya, E.",2009,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181aa06ea,0,0,
1920,EuroWilson: The first prospective study of Wilson's disease in Europe,"Aims and methods: Establishment of a European database on Wilson's disease and assessment of the feasibility of pediatric clinical studies. Patients diagnosed between January 1, 2005 and November 30, 2008 were entered using a web-based secure protocol. A previously validated score was used to verify diagnoses. Results: 353 cases (176 females) aged 0.25–56.1 (mean 20.4, median 17.6) years from 321 families were recorded. Apparent incidence (as cases/million population/35 months) was higher in Central Europe (e.g. Poland 2.78, Austria 2.53) than in Western Europe (e.g. France 0.56, UK 0.48, Spain 0.32). Patients homozygous for the common mutation H1069Q were older (27.8 +/- 12.2 years, n = 65) than the others (19.3 +/- 12.5 years). Patients aged < 18 years (N = 181, females = 88) had a more homogeneous geographic distribution. Country-to-country variations in the percentage of pediatric cases likely reflect differential detection of adult cases, e.g. B. Poland 18%, UK 86%. 2 non-EU countries, Turkey and India, contributed 27 and 16 pediatric cases, respectively. The mean (median) BMI SDS in 81 cases whose height was measured was 1.8 (2.06). The median diagnostic score was 6 (range 4-10); KF rings were available in 50; Ceruloplasmin was measured at 172 and was >0.18 g/L at 34; Urinary copper was measured at 161 and a penicillamine challenge was performed at 66; 105 had a liver biopsy, but only 78 had a liver copper test, 11 of whom had a result < 250 mg/g; 2 mutations were identified in 82 of which 26 were homozygous (9 for H1069Q). The severity of liver disease varied: 5% had hepatic encephalopathy, 32% had severe and 18% mild liver disease, 38% had only abnormal LFTs, and only 7% had no hepatic abnormalities. Neurological abnormalities were present in 21% and were severe in 5%, with no correlation to the severity of liver disease. There was a variety of initial treatments and dosages. Conclusions: This first prospective study by WD shows: (1) the higher incidence in Eastern Europe; (2) diagnosis remains difficult due to lack of sensitivity in each diagnostic parameter and selective use of tests, but is aided by a scoring system; (3) relatively high BMI SDS at diagnosis; (4) wide phenotypic and genotypic variation; (5) in patients < 18 years, liver failure is rare, but 93% of cases have a liver abnormality and 21% have a neurologic abnormality; (6) Inclusion of cases from non-EU countries is required to create pediatric RCTs.",,"Tanner, S.;Dhawan, A.;Socha, P.;Loudianos, G.;Lszl, S.;Parker, S.;Vegnente, A.;Houwen, R.;Sarles, J.;Deutsch, J.",2009,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181aa06ea,0,0,
1921,Successful treatment of fulminant Wilson's disease by plasma exchange,"Background: The treatment of fulminant Wilson disease without liver transplantation is still associated with a high mortality rate. There is no other acceptable treatment than a liver transplant. Few case reports have successfully treated fulminant Wilson's disease with plasma exchange. Case Report: We report here a case of a 14-year-old boy who presented to our hospital with fulminant Wilson's disease including low AST and AlT and alkaline phosphatase, high bilirubin 38 mg/dl, INR 3.1, creatinine 0, 6 mg/dl, grade II hepatic encephalopathy, mild ascites, positive Kayser-Fleischer ring, low ceruloplasmin, high serum copper, and a hematological picture consistent with hemolysis. He was treated with 5 plasma exchange sessions with improvised synthetic function in addition to conservative treatment, and at the end of the last plasma exchange session he was delisted from the liver transplant and treatment for Wilson's disease started. He has improved markedly over the past year and has become asymptomatic with almost normal synthetic function. He's now just D-penicillamine and zinc. Conclusion: Successful treatment of WD with plasma exchange and other supportive measures has been described. This case is another example. This could be due to removing excess copper as a key confounding factor, rather than removing other agents, as this treatment is unsuccessful in other etiologies of FHF.",,"Jarrad, A.;Hammoudi, S.;Saed, R.;Obed, A.;Al Bashir, A.",2009,July,,0,0,
1922,"Wilson's disease in children; A six year experience, 2001-2008","Objectives: To describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of children with Wilson's disease presenting at the Hospital for Sick Children, a large tertiary care pediatric center. Methods: Patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease between 2001 and 2008 were identified from clinical databases and a retrospective record review was performed. Results: Eleven patients were identified, with a mean age at presentation of 12 years (range 7-17 years). Nine of 11 patients had a hepatic presentation including jaundice, hepatomegaly, ascites, pale stools, or hematemesis. Of these patients, three had overlapping neuropsychiatric symptoms ranging from encephalopathy to paraesthesia. Five of the nine patients with hepatic decompensation also had negative hemolytic Coomb's anemia. Eighteen percent (2/11) presented with isolated neurological complaints (developmental delay and ataxia in one, paraesthesia in the other). These children presented at a younger age (mean, 7 years) compared to the group mean of 12 years. Five out of 11 children (45%) presented themselves with Kaiser Fleischer rings. Only one case had a positive family history of Wilson's disease; This family had a history of consanguinity. Two separate children were identified as asymptomatic carriers through family screening. At presentation, mean (range) laboratory values were as follows: ceruloplasmin 115 mg/L (27-253 mg/L), 24-hour urinary copper excretion 13.7 μmol (0.290-60.5), INR 1, 9 (0.9-4.3), total bilirubin 85 (4-361), albumin 29 (23-48), AST 238 (44-1083), alkaline phosphatase 251 (20-824), WBC 10.7 ( 3.7-25.2), hemoglobin 101 g/L (54-134), and platelets 205 (88-460). The new Wilson disease severity score was calculated for each patient and ranged from 3 to 16 (on a possible scale of 0 to 20). Among the three patients who scored 11 or more and were therefore predicted to require liver transplantation, one recovered with medical therapy. Children have been treated with a combination of chelating agents including penicillamine, trientine and/or zinc. Clinical outcomes were evaluated a mean of 2.5 years (range 0.14-5.8) after diagnosis. None of the children died. Three patients underwent liver transplantation (two shortly after diagnosis and one patient five years later). A recently diagnosed patient is currently awaiting transplantation. Two patients developed neuropsychiatric symptoms despite chelation treatment. Conclusions: Children with Wilson's disease have a variety of clinical presentations, are likely to respond to chelation therapy, and occasionally require liver transplantation. The new Wilson disease index should be used with caution as it does not reliably indicate the need for transplantation.",,"Avinashi, V.;Ling, S.",2009,,,0,1,
1923,Prospective look at the use of trients in Wilson's disease: A safer alternative,"We report the course of 5 patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease, aged between 13 and 30 years, 3 females and 2 males, who developed multiple adverse reactions upon initiation of penicillamine therapy, including thrombocytopenia (3 patients), allergic skin reactions (3 patients) . , worsening of neuropsychiatric features (1 patient) and status dystonicus (1 patient). These side effects started within 1 month to 6 months after starting treatment with penicillamine. Discontinuation of penicillamine therapy and initiation of therapy with trientene resulted in improvement in neuropsychiatric characteristics and improvement in status dystonic characteristics, as well as resolution of thrombocytopenia. We would like to suggest that patients with Wilson's disease who have started penicillamine therapy are closely followed up to look for these side effects and suggest that trients may be a safer alternative to penicillamine therapy in a subset of patients with Morbus Wilson would be and possibly even be better served than initial therapy.",,"Viswanathan, S.;Puvanarajah, S.

1924,"Clinical presentation, diagnosis and long-term results of 35 patients with Wilson's disease","Purpose: Wilson disease is an inherited, autosomal recessive disorder. Subsequent accumulation of copper in the liver, brain and other tissues leads to hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological and other clinical manifestations of disorders. We describe the clinical features, management, and follow-up of a cohort of 35 patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records and cerebral imaging of 35 patients with Wilson's disease followed by the National Institute of Neurology in Tunis. The diagnosis of the disease was based on the presence of abnormal biochemical tests: increased urinary copper excretion, decreased serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper levels. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 18.9 years (range 4 to 56 years). The observation period was up to 7.5 years. The most common symptoms were tremor (42.8%), dysarthria (22.8%) and behavioral disorders (17.1%). A Kayser-Fleischer ring was observed in 45.7%. Cerebral imaging was abnormal in 62.5% of patients. Atrophy of the cerebrum with signal disturbances in the gray matter of the brain was observed in 25%. One patient had severe subcortical white matter abnormalities, which are uncommon features in Wilson's disease. The clinical symptoms of the patients on D-penicillamine remained stable or improved during the observation period in 65.7% of the cases, while 6 out of 35 patients got worse. Conclusion: The diagnosis of Wilson's disease can be difficult in the absence of typical symptoms and in asymptomatic siblings. D-penicillamine is a safe and effective long-term treatment in patients with Wilson's disease. If treatment is started early enough, a normal quality of life can be expected.",,"Ellini, S.;Ammar, N.;Larnaout, A.;Hentati, F.;Zouari, M.",2009,October,,0,0,
1925,Significant tremors? Wilson disease?,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited copper metabolism disorder associated with degenerative changes in the basal ganglia. The gene for Wilson's disease is located on the long arm of chromosome 13 and encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase that is expressed in the liver and kidney. Clinical symptoms are complex with neurological symptoms such as tremor, dysarthria, psychiatric disorders, etc., predominant liver disease or mixed forms. 40-50% of patients present with neurological abnormalities, and resting or postural tremor is the first clinical sign in half of them. Case report: He had tremors in his hands for ten years and he had used mysoline and propranolol for tremors which were not effective. He had a family history of essential tremor in his father and uncle. His physical examination was normal except for the postural tremor. His mental state and school performance were normal. Although there was no family history of Wilson's disease, plasma ceruloplasmin levels were low (16 mg/dl) and 24-hour urinary copper collection was high (62 micrograms). Cranial magnetic resonance showed hyperintense bilateral lesions at the globus pallidus and putamen on T2-weighted images. He was diagnosed with Wilson's disease and began therapy with penicillamine, zinc, vitamin B, and a low-copper diet. Conclusion: Wilson's disease must always be kept in mind in all childhood movement disorders, even if there are long-term quiescent neurological signs and no liver involvement.",,"Gokben, S.;Arikan, C.;Serdaroglu, G.;Yilmaz, S.;Tekgul, H.;Aydogdu, S.",2009,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1090-3798%2809%2970357-5,0,0,
1926,"Liver cirrhosis, dystonia, polycythemia and hypermanganemia--a new metabolic disorder","We report a new constellation of clinical features consisting of hypermanganemia, liver cirrhosis, an extrapyramidal movement disorder, and polycythemia in a 12-year-old girl born to consanguineous parents. Blood manganese levels were >3000 nmol/L (normal range <320 nmol/L) and MRI showed basal ganglia signal abnormalities consistent with manganese deposition. An older brother with the same phenotype died at age 18, suggesting a potentially fatal autosomal recessive disease. This disorder is likely caused by a defect in manganese metabolism with accumulation of manganese in the liver and basal ganglia, similar to copper accumulation in Wilson's disease. To assess the genetic basis of this syndrome, we examined two candidate genes: ATP2C2 and ATP2A3, which encode the manganese-transporting calcium ATPases SPCA2 and SERCA3, respectively. Patient and family genotyping for microsatellite markers around ATP2C2 and ATP2A3 excluded these genes. The patient was found to be heterozygous for both gene loci. Despite the unknown pathophysiology, we were able to develop a successful treatment regimen. Chelation therapy with edetate disodium in combination with iron supplementation is the treatment of choice, which significantly lowers blood manganese levels and improves clinical symptoms. © Springer Science+Business Media BV 2008.",,"Tuschl, K.;Mills, P.

1927,Tetrathiomolybdate protects against bile duct ligation-induced cholestatic liver injury and fibrosis,"Tetrathiomolybdate(TM), a potent copper chelating drug, was originally developed to treat Wilson's disease. Our working hypothesis is that the fibrotic signaling pathway is copper dependent. Since biliary excretion is the major pathway for copper excretion, a biliary duct ligation (BDL) mouse model was used to test the potential protective effects of TM. TM was administered at a daily dose of 0.9 mg/mouse by intragastric gavage 5 days before BDL. All animals were sacrificed 5 days after surgery. Plasma liver enzymes and total bilirubin were markedly reduced in TM-treated BDL mice. TM also inhibited the increase in plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 observed in BDL mice. Cholestatic liver damage was markedly attenuated by TM treatment as shown by histology. Hepatic collagen deposition was significantly reduced, and there was a parallel significant suppression of alpha-actin and fibrogenic gene expression in liver smooth muscle in TM-treated BDL mice. Although endogenous antioxidant capacity was enhanced, oxidative stress, such as that caused by malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxyalkenals, hepatic glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio, was not attenuated by TM treatment, suggesting that the protective mechanism of TM is independent of oxidative stress could. In conclusion, TM attenuated BDL-induced cholestatic liver injury and fibrosis in mice, in part by inhibiting TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 secretion. The protective mechanism appears to be independent of oxidative stress. Our data provide further evidence that TM could be a potential therapy for liver fibrosis.",,"Song, M.;Song, Z.;Barve, S.;Zhang, J.;Chen, T.;Liu, M.;Arteel, G. E.;Brewer, G. J.;McClain, C.

1928,"Wilson protein expression, copper excretion, and sweat production in sweat glands of Wilson's disease patients and control subjects","Background: In Wilson disease, copper is not adequately excreted into the bile due to the absence or malfunction of the Wilson protein copper-ATPase in the hepatocyte excretion pathway. Copper is in sweat. It is not known whether Wilson protein is involved in copper excretion in sweat. The aim of this study is to investigate Wilson protein expression in sweat glands and to analyze its effects on copper excretion into sweat in control subjects and patients with Wilson's disease. Methods: Immunofluorescence analysis of Wilson protein was performed in skin samples from normal rats, LEC rats, and human skin biopsies. For sweat induction, pilocarpine-induced sweat gland stimulation by iontophoretic transfer was used, adapted to the methods used for the cystic fibrosis sweat test. Sweat volume, sweat copper concentration, serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper were analyzed in 28 Wilson patients and 21 controls. Results: The Wilson protein is expressed in human and rat sweat gland epithelium. Copper concentration in sweat does not differ significantly between controls and Wilson patients. Wilson patients produce significantly less sweat than controls. Sweat production is partially reversible in Wilson patients undergoing medical treatment for Wilson disease or after liver transplantation. Conclusion: Wilson patients show reduced sweat production with unchanged copper concentration in sweat. The Wilson protein may play an important role in physiological sweat production. © 2008 Schaefer et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Schaefer, M.;Schellenberg, M.;Merle, U.;Weiss, K.

1930,Estimation of free copper ion concentrations in blood serum using T<inf>1</inf> relaxation rates,"The water proton relaxation rate constant R 1 = 1/T 1 (at 60 MHz) of blood serum is significantly increased by the presence of free Cu 2+ ions at concentrations above normal physiological levels. The addition of chelating agents to serum containing paramagnetic Cu<sup>2+</sup> reverses this effect. This was demonstrated on the effect of adding a chelating agent D-penicillamine (D-PEN) to aqueous solutions of CuSO<inf>4</inf> and CuCl<inf>2</inf> and to rabbit blood serum. We propose that measurement of the spin lattice relaxation rate constants of water protons before and after chelation can be used as an alternative approach to monitor the presence of free copper ions in blood serum. This method can be used in the diagnosis of some diseases (leukemia, liver diseases and especially Wilson's disease) because the proton relaxation technique is sensitive only to those dissolved in the blood serum, unlike traditional methods such as spectrophotometry, which detects the total number of both bound and free ions free paramagnetic ions. The change in R1 after chelation was found to be less than 0.06 s<sup>-1</sup> for serum from healthy subjects but greater than 0.06 s<sup>-1</sup> for Serum from untreated Wilson patients. © 2008.",,"Blicharska, B.;Witek, M.;Fornal, M.;MacKay, A.

1932,Effect of D-penicillamine on liver fibrosis and inflammation in Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease is a disorder of copper metabolism characterized by copper overload. A mutation in the ATP7B gene causes dysfunction of the ATP7B protein and a reduction in biliary copper excretion in hepatocytes. Excess copper accumulation leads to liver damage. D-penicillamine can primarily inhibit fibrogenesis and prevent the occurrence of cicatricial lesions in the liver. We have studied this phenomenon in our patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pathologic specimens from the explanted livers of 26 patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 with Wilson's disease with hepatoneurological manifestations and who had undergone liver transplantation were retrospectively examined. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to their D-penicillamine anamnesis before transplantation. The degree of fibrosis and inflammation was graded as mild (1), moderate (2), and severe (3) and reviewed by an impartial hepatopathologist. RESULTS: Of 26 patients (20 males, 6 females) with Wilson's disease with a mean age of 17.6 -/+ 8.6 years, 69% (18/26) had a history of D-penicillamine prior to liver transplantation of 6 Months to 9 years (mean 3.4 -/+ 2.7 years). In the D-penicillamine group, 14 patients (77%) had grade 1 fibrosis. Grade 2 and 3 fibrosis was observed in 5.6% and 16% of patients, respectively. In the D-penicillamine group, inflammation was grade 3 in 44% (8/18), grade 2 in 44% (8/18), and grade 1 in 11% (2/18) of patients. In the non-D-penicillamine group (8 patients), the grades of fibrosis were Grade 3 (62%), Grade 2 (25%), and Grade 1 (12%); 87% of the patients had grade 2 and 3 inflammation. The degree of fibrosis was significantly lower in the D-penicillamine group than in the non-D-penicillamine group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: D-penicillamine may reduce the rate of liver fibrogenesis in patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Kazemi, K.;Geramizadeh, B.;Nikeghbalian, S.;Salahi, H.;Bahador, A.;Reza Nejatollahi, S.

1933,Liver disease in pregnancy,"Abnormal liver function tests occur in 3% to 5% of pregnancies, with many possible causes including accidental liver disease (most commonly viral hepatitis or gallstones) and underlying chronic liver disease. However, most liver dysfunction in pregnancy is pregnancy-related and is caused by one of the 5 liver diseases unique to pregnancy: these fall into two main categories depending on their association with or without preeclampsia. The preeclampsia-associated liver diseases are preeclampsia itself, hemolysis (H), elevated liver enzyme (EL) and low platelet count (LP) (HELLP) syndrome, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Hyperemesis gravidarum and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are unrelated to preeclampsia. Although still enigmatic, there have recently been interesting advances in the understanding of these unique pregnancy-related liver diseases. Hyperemesis gravidarum is intractable, dehydrating vomiting in the first trimester of pregnancy; 50% of patients with this disease have impaired liver function. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is itching and increased bile acids in the second half of pregnancy, accompanied by high levels of aminotransferases and mild jaundice. Treatment of the mother with ursodeoxycholic acid is symptomatic; However, this is a high-risk pregnancy for the fetus, requiring close fetal monitoring and early delivery. Severe preeclampsia itself is the most common cause of liver sensitivity and liver dysfunction in pregnancy, and 2–12% of cases are further complicated by hemolysis (H), elevated liver enzymes (EL), and low platelet count (LP)—the HELLP syndrome. Immediate delivery is the only definitive therapy, but many maternal complications can occur, including detachment of the placenta, renal failure, subcapsular hematoma, and liver rupture. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a sudden, catastrophic condition that occurs almost exclusively in the third trimester; microvesicular fatty infiltration of hepatocytes causes acute liver failure with coagulopathy and encephalopathy. Early diagnosis and prompt delivery are critical to maternal and fetal survival. Copyright © 2007 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",,"Hay, J.

1934,Liver ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion induces and transports the multispecific metal transporter Atp7b to the biliary tubules: possible preferential transport of iron into the bile,"It has been reported that both Atp7b (Wilson's disease gene) and Atp7a (Menkes' disease gene) are trafficked by copper. ATP7b is transported to the bile duct tubules and ATP7a to the plasma membrane. Whether or not hepatic ischemia or ischemia-reperfusion modulate expression and transport of ATP7b has not been reported. In this study, we report for the first time that the multispecific metal transporter ATP7b is significantly induced and transported by both hepatic ischemia alone and hepatic ischemia reperfusion, as assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses. Although hepatocytes also stained for Atp7b, localized intense staining of Atp7b was found on the bile duct tubules. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis of bile copper, iron, zinc and manganese revealed a corresponding significant increase in bile iron. In our attempt to determine whether the observed increased biliary iron transport might be a result of altered bile flow, lysosomal transport, or bile glutathione transport, we measured bile flow, bile acid phosphatase activity, and glutathione content. No significant difference was found in bile flow, bile acid phosphatase activity, and glutathione between control livers and livers subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. Therefore, we conclude that induction of hepatic ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion and transport of Ap7b to the biliary tubules may contribute to preferential biliary iron transport. © 2007 Humana Press Inc.",,"Goss, J.

She was diagnosed with EbetaT at the age of 2, but the coexistence of WD could not be established until she was 11 years old. The diagnosis of the latter was based on the clinical presentation of hepatitis and severe negative hemolytic Coomb's anemia associated with laboratory evidence from WD. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the co-occurrence of EbetaT and WD. Because both conditions are associated with varying degrees of hemolysis, WM can remain masked in the EbetaT setting and consequently go undiagnosed for long periods of time. Sudden, severe hemolysis in a patient with thalassemia can be explained by the coexistence of an additional pathology, in this case WD. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",,"Thapa, R.;Mukherjee, K.",2008,December,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPH.0b013e31818c00fc,0,0,

Similarly, it can regulate changes in levels of iron, copper, and zinc during lactation. For iron, this regulation is achieved by the transferrin receptor, DMT1, and ferroportin, while mammary copper metabolism is regulated by Ctr1, ATP7A, and ATP7B. Zinc homeostasis is complex and involves both zinc importers (Zip3) and zinc exporters (ZnT-1, ZnT-2, and ZnT-4). Both transcriptional and post-translational regulation can affect protein abundance and cellular localization of these transporters by finely orchestrating the uptake, intracellular transport, and secretion of iron, copper, and zinc.

1944,Mild zinc deficiency and dietary phytic acid accelerate the development of fulminant hepatitis in LEC rats,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Restriction of copper intake delays hepatic copper accumulation in Long-Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats, which are animal models of Wilson's disease. The involvement of zinc is suggested to develop hepatitis in the disease; however, this has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mild zinc deficiency on the development of hepatitis and to determine the relationship between absorption and liver levels of copper, zinc and iron. Methods: Male LEC and F344 rats (wild-type atp7b) were fed a zinc-depleted, phytate-containing or control diet. The onset of hepatitis (Experiment 1) and absorption rates of copper, zinc and iron and hepatitis indices at 4 weeks (Experiment 2) were observed. Results: Onset of fulminant hepatitis in LEC rats was much earlier in the low-zinc and low-phytate groups (mean 94.6 +/- 2.74 days and 82.8 +/- 3.56 days, respectively) than in the control group (136 +/- 2.11 days old) with worse hepatitis indices. Hepatic copper levels were much higher in LEC rats than in F344 rats, but did not differ significantly between diet groups with no marked changes in copper absorption. Hepatic levels and intestinal absorption of zinc and iron were lower in the phytate group than in the control group. Conclusion: Mild zinc deficiency caused by a diet rich in zinc or phytate accelerates the onset of hepatitis in LEC rats without increasing copper absorption, and zinc and iron metabolism may be implicated in the earlier onset of jaundice in LEC rats be. © 2006 The Authors.",,"Saito, A.;Nakayama, K.;Hara, H.",2007,February,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1746.2006.04506.x,0,0,

1949,Hereditary metabolic disease of the liver,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Elucidating the metabolic pathways for copper and iron improved our understanding of Wilson's disease and genetic hemochromatosis. Some inherited liver diseases are now characterized by protein folding mutations, including Gaucher disease, cystic fibrosis, and ZZ-alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. Studies are now focused on associations between glycogen storage disease, the formation of hepatic adenomas and conversion to hepatocellular carcinoma. Continued advances in research into the diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of hereditary liver disease are the subject of this review. RECENT RESULTS: Further understanding of iron and copper metabolic pathways has led to a search for factors that alter the phenotypic expression of Wilson's disease and genetic hemochromatosis. Hepcidin plays a key role in modulating iron uptake in iron overload disorders, and new studies are elucidating the regulation of hepcidin. In glycogen storage diseases, studies of the natural history and hepatocellular transformation require tumor surveillance and possible early transplantation. A better understanding of the genetic and non-genetic modifiers in ZZ-alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency and other protein misfolding disorders will improve our ability to treat these patients.

1950,"Consensus recommendations for managing asymptomatic, persistent, non-viral, non-alcohol related elevations in aminotransferase levels. Suggestions for diagnostic procedures and monitoring","sustained increase in non-viral aminotransferase levels may have multiple causes, differing in prevalence and clinical importance. In the general population, the most common cause is nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis, which can progress to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. Treatment for steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis consists of lifestyle modifications while the effectiveness of drug treatment has yet to be determined. Other much less common (but not uncommon) causes of persistent, nonviral, nonalcoholic elevations in aminotransferase levels include celiac disease and hemochromatosis, while autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are rare. Because some of these conditions are treatable, early diagnosis is important. There are no epidemiological data to assess the prevalence of elevated aminotransferase levels associated with the toxicity of medicinal products or other xenobiotics, including herbal products. This document, prepared by a panel of experts based on a systematic review of scientific evidence, is primarily intended for general practitioners and transfusion centers, who are typically the first point of contact for people with elevated aminotransferases.

1954,liver fibrosis,"Liver damage results in an inflammatory response and the activation and proliferation of mesenchymal cell populations within the liver, which remodel the extracellular matrix as part of an orchestrated wound healing response. Chronic damage leads to progressive accumulation of scarring proteins (fibrosis) that, with increasing severity, alter tissue structure and function, leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. Efforts to modulate the fibrogenesis process have focused on understanding the biology of heterogeneous liver fibroblast populations. The fibroblasts originate from sources inside and outside the liver. Fibroblasts expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin (myofibroblasts) may derive from transdifferentiation of quiescent hepatic stellate cells. Other fibroblasts emerge from the portal pathways within the liver. At least some of these cells in diseased liver come from the bone marrow. In addition, fibrogenic fibroblasts can also be generated by the transition from liver epithelium (hepatocytes and bile epithelial cells) to mesenchyme. Whatever its origin, it is clear that fibrogenic fibroblast activity is sensitive to (and can be active in) the cytokine and chemokine profiles of liver-resident leukocytes, such as macrophages. They can also be a component that drives tissue regeneration. Understanding the complex intercellular interactions that regulate liver fibrogenesis is of increasing importance given the predicted increase in chronic liver disease and the current lack of effective therapies. © The Authors.",,"Wallace, K.;Burt, A.

1955,Single-pass albumin dialysis (SPAD) in fulminant Wilson's liver failure: A case report,"Because fulminant Wilson's liver failure has an extremely poor prognosis, the use of a liver assist device that can bridge patients to liver transplantation is life-saving. Here we report the case of a 17-year-old woman who presented with fulminant Wilson's liver failure and intravascular hemolysis. With the subsequent development of encephalopathy and oliguria, single-pass albumin dialysis (SPAD) was initiated for 5 days to enhance copper removal. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) was performed using the PRISMA device with a blood flow of 100 mL/min and a dialysate flow of 2 L/h for 8 h, then 1 L/h. A 5% albumin dialysate was prepared by substituting 1L of 25% albumin for 1L of Hemosol BO in a 5L bag. Single-pass albumin dialysis resulted in reductions in serum copper (154 to 59 mg/dL), conjugated bilirubin (37 to 23 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase (1305 to 729 units/L), and creatinine (1.1 to 0. 9 mg/dl). ) and reduced need for blood transfusions. Termination of SPAD was followed by three plasmapheresis treatments for further copper removal. We conclude that SPAD may be an effective treatment in fulminant Wilson's disease with hemolysis, but that it should be used in combination with chelation to optimize copper removal. ©IPNA 2008.",,"Collins, K.

1956,Do cytokines play a role in Wilson's disease?,"The aim of this study was to determine the serum cytokine levels in patients with Wilson's disease (WM) and to correlate them with phenotype, therapy status and laboratory data. In this cross-sectional study, serum levels of cytokines were measured in 34 patients (M:F, 23:11; drug-naïve, 11) with WM (mean ages: 13.8 +/- 8.6 and 19.6 +/- 9.03 years) estimated ) and compared to 30 controls. The following serum cytokines were analyzed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: (i) tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, (ii) interferon (IFN)-gamma, (iii) interleukin (IL)-2, (iv) IL-6 and (v) IL-4. Serum TNF-alpha (p<0.001), IFN-gamma (p=0.005), and IL-6 (p<0.001) were detectable in WD compared to controls. However, the increase in serum levels of IL-4 (p=0.49) and IL-2 (p=0.11), although detectable compared to controls, was not statistically significant. Disease severity and therapeutic status had no effect on cytokines. The presence of anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia and hepatic dysfunction did not affect cytokine levels. There was a significant negative correlation between IL-6 and ceruloplasmin (P=0.04) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4) and copper levels (P=0.01). Serum cytokines, both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory subtypes, were significantly elevated in patients with WD.

The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate a clinical rating scale, termed the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), to assess the full spectrum of clinical symptoms in WM. A total of 107 patients (mean age 37.6 +/- 11.9 years; 46 males, 61 females) with treated MM participated in the study. Cronbach's alpha as a measure of internal consistency for the entire scale was 0.92, while the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.98 (confidence interval (CI<inf>95%</inf>) 0.97-0.99 ), indicating excellent interrater reliability, as determined in 32 patients. In addition, the total score correlated significantly with the patients' ability to work as indicated by an estimated Spearman's rho = 0.54 (CI<inf>95%</inf> 0.40-0.69, P<0.001).

The affected gene, ATP7B, encodes a hepatic copper-transporting protein that plays a key role in human copper metabolism. Clinical symptoms are divided into neurological symptoms such as tremor, dysarthria, psychiatric disorders, etc.; predominant liver disease or mixed presentations. Copper deposits in the liver can lead to acute liver failure, chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Early detection by clinical, biochemical, or genetic testing and early initiation of therapy with chelating agents or zinc salts are essential for a favorable outcome and prognosis.

1960,Liver transplantation in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism characterized by decreased biliary copper excretion, leading to tissue copper accumulation with liver damage and failure. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) can be life-saving for patients with Wilson's disease who have fulminant liver failure and for patients who are unresponsive to medical therapy. The aim of this study was to review our experience with OLT in patients with Wilson's disease. Between September 2001 and April 2007, 25 OLTs were performed in 24 patients (7 females and 17 males) with Wilson's disease, mean age 15.6 +/- 9.9 years (range 5-51 years). Six patients were transplanted because of concomitant fulminant hepatic insufficiency and 18 patients with chronic advanced liver disease with (n = 8) or without (n = 10) associated neurological manifestations. We performed 3 full-size OLTs from deceased donors and 22 OLTs from living related donors. Eight patients had a family history of Wilson's disease. We were able to demonstrate a Kayser-Fleischer ring in 18 patients. All patients had low serum ceruloplasmin levels (mean 27.8 mg/dL) and high urinary copper excretion (mean 4119 µg/day) prior to OLT. After successful OLT, all patients experienced a significant reduction in urinary copper excretion (median 37.1 µg/day). The mean follow-up time was 21.7 +/- 19.8 months (range 2-60 months). One patient required retransplantation 12 days after the first OLT because the primary graft failed. Five of the 24 patients died within 4 months after the operation. The remaining 19 survivors (79%) remained healthy with normal liver function and no disease recurrence. In conclusion, OLT has been a curative procedure for Wilson's disease in patients with fulminant hepatic failure and others with end-stage hepatic insufficiency. After OLT, serum ceruloplasmin levels rose to the normal range, urinary copper excretion decreased, and neurological manifestations improved. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We reviewed the literature to identify potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications of TMS in pediatric neurology and also its safety in pediatrics. Although TMS has not been associated with serious side effects in children and appears to be well tolerated, general safety guidelines should be established.

1962,Copper Status Biomarkers: A Brief Update,"The essentiality of copper (Cu) in humans is evidenced by various clinical deficiency symptoms such as anemia, hypercholesterolemia and bone malformations. Despite significant efforts over several decades, a sensitive and specific biomarker for Cu status has yet to be identified. This article updates a comprehensive review recently published by the authors that assesses the reliability and robustness of current biomarkers and outlines the ongoing search for new indicators of status. The salient features of this earlier review are repeated while considering whether there are other untested approaches that may provide valuable information in the search for an appropriate measure of copper status. Current biomarkers include a number of cuproenzymes such as the acute phase protein ceruloplasmin and Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase, all of which are influenced by a range of other dietary and environmental factors. A recent development is the identification of the Cu chaperone, CCS, as a potential biomarker; although its reliability has yet to be established. This seems to be the most promising potential biomarker that responds to both Cu deficiency and excess. The potential to identify a “suite” of biomarkers using high-throughput technologies such as transcriptomics and proteomics is only now being explored. A combination of these technologies coupled with a range of innovative metal detection techniques is essential if the search for robust copper biomarkers is to be successful. © The Authors 2008.",,"Harvey, L.

[Spanish]","Aim: To analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment and follow-up of a cohort of 29 patients with Wilson's disease (WD) in the Murcia region. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 29 cases of WM (mean age 20.3 +/- 13.4 years) diagnosed in the past 16 years. Results: The most common reason for consultation was the finding of high transaminase levels in almost half of the patients, followed by tremor or dystonia in 17% of the patients each. A Kayser-Fleischer ring was observed in 17/29 (58.6%) patients (100% of patients with purely neurological involvement and 35% of patients with purely clinical liver disease; p<0.001). Blood copper levels not associated with ceruloplasmin and cupruria were significantly superior in patients with neurological symptoms and in patients with liver cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis. In 18 of 29 patients (62%), the clinical symptoms of the patients on D-penicillamine or trientine remained stable or improved during the observation period, while 11 of 29 patients (38%) worsened. Conclusions: In our region, patients with WM are diagnosed at a younger age and in most cases because of liver disease. Patients with neurological disorders or liver cirrhosis had high levels of free copper that were not associated with ceruloplasmin and cupruria. The disease progressed favorably in all patients except those diagnosed with liver disease or advanced neurological disease. Copyright © 2008 Aran Ediciones, SL",,"Rodrigo Agudo, J.

1967,Epilepsy in hereditary metabolic disorders,"Introduction: Research into neurometabolic diseases is still in a relatively early stage. The catalog of these diseases continues to grow; Some well-known clinical syndromes have been subdivided into several variants after identification of the genes causing them, and at the same time new metabolic disorders have been discovered that exacerbate or contribute to forms of epilepsy not previously classified as cerebral metabolic disorders. Results: This review article presents the basic principles of the detection and treatment of epilepsy due to neurometabolic diseases. These disorders are divided (for clarity) into epilepsy occurring in neonates, children, adolescents and adults, recognizing that there is a significant degree of overlap between these chronological stages. Current methods of analysis and therapeutic approaches are summarized both from a general point of view and in the context of each clinical syndrome, recognizing that each patient has specific peculiarities and that antiepileptic drugs in general offer few advantages compared to more specific forms of therapy (e.g. special diets or vitamins ) when displayed. We also include therapeutic recommendations and a general approach to fulminant epilepsies of neurometabolic origin and emphasize the importance of identifying, during the diagnostic and genetic counseling process, any relatives of the subject who could be potential carriers of a genetic disorder. Particular value is placed on curatively treatable disorders and the importance of aftercare by specialist staff. Conclusion: It is expected that in a few years it will be possible to know (possibly through non-invasive methods) the metabolic profile of these diseases, which will facilitate accurate diagnosis and establish the response to treatment and identify all individuals, who are carriers or remain minimally symptomatic with respect to their risk of manifesting or transmitting epilepsy.

1968,Efficacy of tetrathiomolybdate in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis,"Tetrathiomolybdate(TM) is a potent anti-copper drug developed for Wilson's disease. We have found several potent outcomes from lowering copper levels with TM in mouse models of disease, using serum Cp as a surrogate marker of copper status, and targeting Cp levels from 20% to 50% of baseline. We have found effective results of TM therapy in mouse models of fibrosis; Inflammation; damage from exogenous agents such as acetaminophen and doxorubicin; and immunomodulated diseases such as concanavalin A hepatitis, collagen II-induced arthritis, and the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type I diabetes. In the current study, we investigate TM efficacy in the EAE mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS). We find that clinical levels of neurological damage are significantly inhibited by TM therapy, whether therapy is initiated prior to MS-inducing antigen administration or after symptoms have developed from antigen administration. Furthermore, we find that experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) treatment produces a marked increase in oxidative damage as measured by urinary isoprostane levels, and TM strongly and significantly suppresses these isoprostane increases. Finally, in this model we find marked increases in inflammatory and immune-related cytokines, and we find that TM strongly and significantly suppresses these increases. © 2008.",,"Hou, G.;Abrams, G.

1973,Medical Countermeasures Against Nuclear Threats: Radionuclide Decorators,"Exposure to radionuclides dispersed from a radiological dispersing device or deposited as fallout following a nuclear power plant accident or the detonation of an improvised nuclear device could result in internal contamination of a significant number of individuals. Internalized radionuclides can cause both acute and chronic radiation damage and increase a person's risk of cancer. This damage and risk can be mitigated through the use of decorating agents that reduce internal contamination. Unfortunately, the most effective agents decorate only a limited range of radionuclides, and some are formulated in such a way that administration in mass casualty situations would be challenging. There is a need for new radionuclide decorating agents, reformulations of existing agents, and/or expansion of the indicated indications for existing treatments. Researchers developing new or improved decorating agents should also understand the regulatory pathway for those products. This workshop, the first in nearly half a century to focus solely on radionuclide decoration, brought together researchers and scientific administrators from academia, government and industry, as well as senior regulatory affairs officials and staff from the US Food and Drug Administration.

Neurological and psychiatric symptoms can occur due to copper deposits in the brain. Psychiatric manifestations can range from mood disorders, behavioral and personality disorders to cognitive impairment, while psychotic symptoms are rarely reported. The aim of this report was to present an unusual case of WM presenting with an untraceable delusional disorder and alcohol abuse without neurological signs. CASE SUMMARY: A 34-year-old male patient with no prior psychiatric or alcohol-dependent history presented with delusions of jealousy and alcohol abuse when he discontinued treatment for WM. Although the patient had no previous symptoms or neurological signs, he was treated for WM for 3 years after the disease was diagnosed at a family health screening, as his brother developed symptomatic WM. The patient began combined pharmacotherapy and after 3 months of follow-up, the psychiatric manifestations were adequately controlled. Conclusions: Although WM is rarely associated with alcohol abuse and delusions of jealousy, this disorder should be considered in the differential diagnosis of these psychiatric manifestations. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

There is an established place for liver transplantation in the presence of liver disease while the indication for neurological manifestations is debated. Between 1993 and 2005, 11 patients underwent liver transplants for Wilson's disease at our facility. We retrospectively reviewed the patient's medical records. The pathology of the explanted livers was analyzed. The patients were divided into three groups based on the development of the disease. Postoperative data collected included patient and graft outcomes, complications, neurological status, and copper metabolism. Six men and five women were transplanted at a mean age of 29.7 years (range 15-48 years). Three patients had a fulminant presentation, two patients had decompensation of an existing disease, and six patients had a chronic disease. Neurological features were prominent in five patients. Pathologic analysis of the explanted graft revealed cirrhosis in all patients. The five patients with a fulminant and acute chronic course also showed necrosis in the explant. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 56.8 months (range 10-129 months). Two patients were transplanted again. One patient died of severe sepsis. Two patients with severe neurological dysfunction showed significant remission of symptoms. Liver transplantation is a safe and effective treatment for both acute and chronic forms of Wilson's disease. Acute presentation correlates with the presence of necrosis in the explanted liver. In our series, there was a relevant improvement in neurological characteristics after transplantation. © Magazine Compilation © 2008 Blackwell Munksgaard.",,"Martin, A.

METHODS: We compared patients with Wilson's disease (n = 18) with age-matched healthy subjects (n = 15) as controls. Diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms and laboratory tests (ceruloplasmin, copper concentrations in urine and liver). P-wave dispersion, a measure of atrial depolarization heterogeneity, was measured as the difference between the duration of the longest and shortest P-wave on 12-lead electrocardiography. Results: All patients were asymptomatic on cardiac examination and had sinus rhythm on electrocardiography. Left ventricular and left atrial diameters, left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular mass index were similar in both groups. The Wilson patients had significantly greater P wave dispersion compared to controls (44.7 +/- 5.8 vs. 25.7 +/- 2.5, P<0.01).

1983,"Chelating agents that control metal metabolism and toxicity pathways: applications in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment","Chelating agents and chelating metal complexes are used in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Cancer cells and normal cells require essential metal ions such as iron, copper and zinc for growth and proliferation. Chelators can target the metabolic pathways of cancer cells by controlling proteins involved in the regulation of these metals, as well as other molecules involved in cell cycle control, angiogenesis, and suppression of metastases. Other targets include inhibition of specific proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase involved in DNA synthesis, inhibition of free radical damage to DNA caused by iron and copper catalytic centers, inhibition of microbial growth in immunocompromised cancer patients, and the Decoporation of radioactive and other toxic metals that cause cancer. Chelating agents and metal ions can affect the metabolism, efficacy and toxicity of anti-cancer drugs such as doxorubicin, mitozantrone, bleinomycin and hydroxyurea (HU). Although many experimental chelators have proven effective as anticancer agents, few, e.g. dexrazoxane, deferoxamine (DFO) and triapine, have reached the stage of clinical trials or use. In many experimental models, deferiprone (L1) has been shown to be effective in cancer prevention and treatment and in inhibiting doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. New anticancer drugs could be developed using chelators and chelator complexes with platinum and other metals, as well as new protocols for combining chelators with known anticancer drugs.

1984,Tetrathiomolybdate versus trientine in the initial treatment of neurological Wilson's disease,"Background: The initial treatment of the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease is problematic. Penicillamine, which is used in most patients for years, causes neurological deterioration in up to half of these patients, and half of those patients who deteriorate never recover. Zinc, ideal for maintenance therapy, is too slow for these acutely ill patients. We developed tetrathiomolybdate(TM) for this type of patient and it has performed well in open-label studies. Trientine, another anticopper drug on the market that is approved for patients with penicillamine intolerance, has not been tested in this type of patient. Here we report a double-blind study of TM versus trientine in a patient with neurological Wilson's disease. Design and Methods: The study was a double-blind design in which patients received either TM plus zinc or trientine plus zinc for 8 weeks* Patients were enrolled if they presented with neurological symptoms of Wilson's disease if they had not been treated for more than 4 days weeks with penicillamine or trientine. Patients were followed up at the hospital for 8 weeks of treatment with weekly semi-quantitative neurological and speech assessments to assess possible neurological deterioration. They also had weekly blood and urine tests. On discharge from the hospital, maintenance zinc therapy was continued and they returned for further evaluation at annual intervals for 3 years. Results: 23 patients were enrolled in the Trientine arm and 6 met criteria for neurological deterioration, while 25 patients were enrolled in the TM arm and only 1 patient worsened (p<0.05). One patient on trientine had one adverse event, while 7 on TM had adverse events. All adverse events were mild. Four patients in the Trientine arm died during follow-up, 3 patients showed initial neurological deterioration, 2 patients in the TM arm died. In those patients who did not deteriorate or die, neurological and language recovery was good over 3 years. Interpretation: TM is superior to trientine for the initial therapy of neurological Wilson's disease. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Askari, F.;Lorincz, M.

1985,"The role of zinc, copper and iron in the pathogenesis of diabetes and diabetic complications: therapeutic effects of chelating agents","Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), and Iron (Fe) are essential minerals required for a variety of biomolecules to maintain normal structure, function, and proliferation of cells. These metals can be toxic in excessive amounts, particularly in certain genetic disorders. The homeostasis of these trace elements results from tightly coordinated regulation by various proteins involved in their uptake, excretion, and intracellular storage/transport. Through the Fenton reaction, Cu and Fe can generate various reactive oxygen species under non-protein-binding conditions that damage tissues or cells. Abnormal metabolism of Zn, Cu and Fe can lead to several chronic pathogenesis such as diabetes or diabetic complications. These pathogenic states appear to be predominant in Zn and Cu deficiency and in Cu and Fe overload. In Fe and Cu overload conditions, Fe and Cu chelating agents could be used to control diabetes and diabetic complications. The importance, toxicity, and role of these metals in the pathogenesis of diabetes and diabetic complications are discussed. Copyright © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",,"Zheng, Y.;Li, X.

1986,Herbal Medicines for Acute Viral Hepatitis: A Ticket to More Trouble,"The rapid deterioration of a patient afflicted with acute liver disease, including the onset of acute liver failure, a life-threatening complication, may in some cases be due to recently administered drugs or other xenibiotics. A previously healthy Indian man diagnosed with acute hepatitis E developed acute liver failure after 5 days of treatment with herbal medicines. Pressuring health authorities and educating the public should help prevent such preventable deaths. Physicians have a responsibility to persuade their patients affected by acute liver disease not to take drugs to relieve symptoms, especially herbal medicines, until they recover. It is hypothesized that some of the fatal cases of acute hepatitis E in pregnant women, a common observation in India, may be due to prior use of herbal medicines at the onset of acute hepatitis E symptoms. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",,"Bernuau, J.

1988,Copper transport systems are involved in multidrug resistance and drug transport,"Copper is an essential trace element and several copper-containing proteins are essential for processes such as oxidative respiration, neural development, and collagen remodeling. Copper metabolism is tightly regulated by several transporters and chaperone proteins. Copper Transport Protein 1 (CTR1) selectively takes up copper into cells. Subsequently, three chaperone proteins, HAH1 (human atx1 homolog 1), Cox17p, and CCS (copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase), transport copper to the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, respectively. Defects in the copper transporters ATP7A and ATP7B are responsible for Menkes disease and Wilson's disease, respectively. These proteins transport copper to the Golgi apparatus via HAH1 to deliver copper to cuproenzymes. They also prevent cell damage from excess copper accumulation by mediating the efflux of copper from the cell. There is increasing evidence that copper transport mechanisms may play a role in drug resistance. We and others found that ATP7A and ATP7B are involved in drug resistance to the anti-tumor drug cis-diaminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP). An association between the expression of ATP7A or ATP7B in tumors and CDDP resistance is supported by clinical studies. In addition, the copper uptake transporter CTR1 has also been reported to play a role in CDDP sensitivity. Furthermore, we recently found that the effect of ATP7A on drug resistance is not unique to CDDP. Using an ex vivo drug susceptibility assay, the Histoculture Drug Response Assay (HDA), expression of ATP7A in human surgically resected colon cancer cells correlated with susceptibility to 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38). ATP7A-overexpressing cells are resistant to many anticancer drugs including SN-38, 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxycamptothecin (CPT-11), vincristine, paclitaxel, etoposide, doxorubicin (Dox ), and mitoxantrone. The mechanism by which ATP7A and copper metabolism modulate drug transport appears to involve modulation of cellular drug localization via modulation of the vesicle transport system. In ATP7A-overexpressing cells, Dox accumulates in the Golgi apparatus. In contrast, in the parental cells, Dox is localized in the nuclei, where Dox's target molecules, topoisomerase II and DNA, are found. Disruption of the intracellular vesicle transport system with monensin, a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ionophore, induced relocalization of Dox from the Golgi apparatus to the nuclei in the ATP7A-overexpressing cells. These data suggest that ATP7A-related drug transport depends on the vesicle transport system. Thus, copper transport systems play an important role in drug transport as well as in copper metabolism. Components of copper metabolism are therefore likely to include target molecules for the modulation of drug efficacy not only of anticancer drugs but also of other drugs. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",,"Furukawa, T.;Komatsu, M.;Ikeda, R.;Tsujikawa, K.;Akiyama, S.

By conferring the importance of Cu in biological systems, a sophisticated mechanism to maintain Cu homeostasis is being engineered by nature. As a result, a wide variety of proteins, namely a family of Cu-bearing proteins, cuproenzymes, Cu transporters, and Cu chaperone proteins, have manifested to allow Cu to show its relevance to biological health. Furthermore, understanding of the role of Cu in hepatic and neuronal functions as well as in angiogenesis continues to advance with the emergence of new molecular tools.

1991,Treatment of seizures in kidney and liver failure,"Introduction: Kidney and liver diseases cause seizures and patients with epilepsy may suffer from diseases that alter the metabolism of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Objectives: To review how seizures may be caused by metabolic disorders due to renal or hepatic disease, by their treatment, or by comorbidities, and how these disorders might affect the choice of AEDs. Results: Seizures occur in renal failure due to toxin accumulation and complications such as sepsis, hemorrhage, malignant hypertension, pH and hydroelectrolytic disorders. Hemodialysis leads to acute dysequilibrium syndrome and dementia. Peritoneal dialysis can cause hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma. Immunosuppression after kidney transplantation is neurotoxic and causes posterior leukoencephalopathy, cerebral lymphoma, and infections. Some antibiotics lower the seizure threshold and risk status epilepticus. The most commonly used antiepileptic drugs in uremia are benzodiazepines, ethosuximide, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. In the treatment of epilepsy in renal failure, the choice of antiepileptic drug remains dependent on the seizure type, but doses should be adjusted, particularly in the case of water-soluble antidepressants with low molecular weight, low protein binding, and small apparent volume of distribution. Liver failure leads to encephalopathy and seizures, which are treated by ammonium levels and reduction in activity of gut bacteria, reversal of cerebral edema, and intracranial hypertension. Phenytoin and benzodiazepines are usually ineffective. Seizures caused by post-hepatic immunosuppression can be treated with phenytoin or levetiracetam. Seizures in Wilson's disease can result from D-penicillamine-dependent piridoxine deficiency. Porphyric attacks can be treated with gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, and levetiracetam. Liver disease alters the pharmacokinetics of AEDs and requires dose adjustments. Antiepileptic drugs that are less metabolised by the liver, such as gabapentin, oxcarbazepine and levetiracetam, are theoretically more suitable. Conclusions: Efficient treatment of seizures in renal and hepatic diseases requires an adequate diagnosis of these disorders and their comorbidities, along with a good knowledge of the metabolism of AEDs, their pharmacokinetic changes in such diseases, careful use of concomitant medications, and monitoring of serum levels of AEDs.",,"De Lacerda, G.

1992,Inherited liver disease. [German],"Elevated liver enzymes are common in clinical practice, and latent hereditary liver disease may play an important role in explaining these abnormalities. In hereditary hemochromatosis, the C282Y mutation leads to increased intestinal iron absorption despite increased total iron stores in the body. The number of gene mutations corresponding to enzymes along heme biosynthesis can lead to porphyrias - a heterogeneous group of inherited metabolic disorders. In Wilson disease, various mutations cause a functional abnormal ATP7B transporter protein responsible for impaired biliary copper excretion. Heterogeneous mutations have been found in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, leading to different clinical expression patterns. In patients with Dubin-Johnson syndrome, altered sequences of the MRP gene correspond to impaired biliary secretion of conjugated bilirubin. Early and adequate diagnosis can help to improve the prognosis of affected patients, as more and more therapeutic options have become established. The scope of this review is not large enough to cover all hereditary liver disorders.

1993,Approach to Wilson's disease in children: analysis of patients diagnosed and treated in the Department of Pediatric and Infectious Diseases in Wrocław (Poland) over the past 10 years,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (degeneratio hepato-lenticulatis) is a rare genetic disease with autosomal recessive inheritance. The consequence of impaired excretion is copper accumulation in the liver, brain, kidneys, cornea and other organs with progressive deterioration in their function. Wilson's disease can take several clinical forms: hepatic, neurological or other. The hepatic form is the most common form in children and adolescents and was the only one observed in our patients. Signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease are often nonspecific: asthenia, anemia, dyspeptic symptoms, joint pain with abnormal liver function tests. Aim of the study: The aim of the study was to analyze patients (age, gender, clinical and laboratory symptoms and signs, type of diagnosis) treated in our department over the past 10 years. Materials and Methods: Descriptive retrospective study; 8 children with Wilson's disease attending the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Unit in Wroclaw, Poland between 1997 and 2007 were enrolled. Results: We treated 8 children (4 girls and 4 boys) with Wilson's disease aged 7-17 years, all with hepatic form. None of the children had a Kayser Fleischer ring. The disease was diagnosed with decreased serum ceruloplasmin levels and increased urinary copper excretion during the differential diagnosis of chronic hepatitis in 6/8 or acute fulminant liver failure in 2/8 patients. Treatment with D-penicillamine in 7 patients or liver transplantation in 1 patient was effective in all children. Conclusions: Wilson's disease should be considered in any child with liver abnormalities of an unexplained nature; serum ceruloplasmin levels and urinary copper excretion should be measured in these children. The copper excretion in the urine after administration of D-penicillamine can also be helpful. The absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings does not exclude the diagnosis of Wilson's disease and is typical for children. Screening of siblings of a patient with Wilson disease is mandatory.

1995,Use of the molecular adsorbent circulatory system for the treatment of acute decompensated Wilson's disease,"Acute decompensated Wilson's disease, which presents as fulminant liver failure, is a life-threatening condition for which liver transplantation is the ultimate treatment. It is listed as a Status 1 indication according to the United Network for Organ Sharing classification. A massive amount of copper released during the attack leads to hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure. Conventional chelation therapy, which attempts to remove copper from the patient, is unsatisfactory because these drugs do not have sufficient time to work and patients are usually oliguric. The Molecular Adsorbents Recirculating System (MARS) is a form of modified dialysis that removes putative albumin-bound toxins associated with liver failure. It is believed that extracorporeal albumin dialysate absorbs the circulating copper molecules trapped in the patient's system. We report on 2 patients with acute decompensated Wilson's disease treated with MARS. In the first case, the patient was started on MARS after conventional treatment had failed. A significant amount of copper was removed from her system and her condition stabilized thereafter. The treatment bought her extra time, and she was eventually bypassed for a liver transplant. In the second case, the patient was started on MARS treatment early in the course of the disease and stabilized soon after treatment. He was able to return to his home country for a liver transplant. In both cases, MARS was used as a means of preventing deterioration rather than rescuing devastation. In conclusion, MARS may benefit patients with acute decompensated Wilson's disease when started early in the disease course. © 2008 AASLD.",,"Chiu, A.;Tsoi, N. S.;Fan, S.

We assessed horizontal saccadic and smooth eye movements using infrared oculography in 50 WM patients, including 29 neurologically symptomatic (WDn) and 21 asymptomatic (WDa), and in 29 healthy controls. We found a statistically significant increase in mean antisaccadic latency (378 ms) and mean antisaccadic error rate (22.5) in the WDn group compared to the WDa group (317 ms and 9.1, respectively) and controls (318 ms or 9.7). . In contrast, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean latency of prosaccades and in the size of the gap effect.

[Japanese]","Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disease, and abnormal copper (Cu) metabolism also occurred due to dysfunction of ATP7B enzyme so that excessive Cu levels are accumulated in the tissues. Ionic Cu binds to methallthionine, causing the cell to be damaged by oxidative oxygen. In fact, unless Cu deposits in tissues need to be removed, tissues are injured because they are hereditary. Among seven cases to which D-penicillamine and zinc acetate were continuously administered alternately every week at the time of the initial symptoms such as dysarthria, athetosis, etc. in childhood, all the cases improved after treatment with Cu chelating agents. But four cases of giving up these drugs in adulthood suffered severe slurred speech, dystonia, ataxia, liver cirrhosis, renal tubular damage and so on. In four cases, despite being treated with the same dose of Cu chelating agents and concomitant physical and speech therapy, the symptoms recurred, the symptoms did not improve but were futile.

2003,Triethylenetetramine and metabolites: values related to urinary copper and zinc excretion in healthy subjects and type 2 diabetics,"Triethylenetetramine (TETA), a selective Cu<sup>II</sup> chelating agent used to treat Wilson's disease, is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of diabetic heart failure. Despite decades of clinical use, knowledge of its pharmacology in humans is still incomplete. Here we first used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to detect and identify major metabolites of TETA in human plasma and urine, and then used this method to estimate the concentrations of TETA and its metabolites in the urine of healthy and diabetic subjects measured in which increasing doses (300, 600, 1200 and 2400 mg) of TETA were administered orally. 24-hour urine collections were performed before and after administration to participants. Two major metabolites of TETA have been detected in human urine, N1-acetyltriethylenetetramine (MAT) and N<inf>1</inf>,N<inf>10</inf>-diacetyltriethylenetetramine, the latter being new. Both metabolites were verified with synthetic standards using LC-MS. The proportion of unchanged TETA excreted in urine as a fraction of the total drug-derived molecules was significantly higher in healthy subjects than in matched diabetics, consistent with a higher rate of TETA metabolism in the latter. TETA-evoked increases in urinary Cu excretion in nondiabetics correlated more closely with parent drug concentrations than in diabetics, while in contrast, urinary Cu was more closely associated with the sum of TETA and MAT. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that MAT may play an important role in the molecular mechanism by which TETA extracts Cu<sup>II</sup> from the systemic compartment in diabetics.

Pretreatment with iron chelators Desferal, Clioquinol, VK-28 and M30 is neuroprotective in both models. To determine the specificity of neuroprotective chelating activity, we examined the effect of D-penicillamine, a relatively specific copper chelator, in the mouse model of MPTP-induced dopamine depletion. Our studies show that D-penicillamine, used to remove copper in Wilson's disease, is relatively weak in preventing MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity compared to previously studied iron chelators.

Wilson's disease is the most common metabolic cause of fulminant liver failure in children over 3 years of age. The aim of this study was to find the main clinical and pathological findings of Wilson's disease in children in Tehran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in the mofid children's hospital. 35 patients suffering from Wilson's disease were examined. A ceruloplasmin level below 20 mg/dl and a copper excretion level in urine above 100 mg/24 h were considered as inclusion criteria. Results: Of the patients, 20 cases were male and 15 female with a mean age of 9 years. Most patients were in the age groups 8-9 and 10-11 years with 37% and 20%, respectively. Liver involvement was confirmed in 100% of patients. Jaundice was observed in 20 patients (57%), abdominal enlargement in 20 patients (57%) and encephalopathy in 9 patients (26%). Serum copper was reduced in 100% and serum ceroluplasmin in 100%, increased urinary copper excretion in 97%, increased AST & ALT in 100%, increased PT in 94% of patients, anemia was found in 100%, leukopenia in 14% and Thrombocytopenia was observed in 71% of patients. In this study, 37% of the patients had neurological symptoms such as tremors, ataxia, speech difficulties and delayed education. 32 patients underwent an ophthalmological examination and 62% showed a KF ring in their ophthalmoscope.

2007,Prospects for gene therapy of Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive copper overload disorder resulting from mutations in the Wilson disease gene ATP7B. The disease typically presents in late childhood or young adults with hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. Because Wilson disease is fatal without medical treatment or liver transplantation, the long-term outcome depends on adherence to effective treatment. As current medical treatments are not effective in all patients with Wilson's disease and adherence to therapy is a problem, gene therapy could represent an alternative curative therapy of the future. In the rat model of Wilson's disease, studies on adenoviral and lentiviral gene transfer have demonstrated that viral gene transfer is therapeutically effective and can reverse clinical symptoms. However, both approaches were limited by more or less transient transgene expression. Because several tactics can be employed to overcome these current limitations, gene therapy approaches could be more efficient than the standard medical treatment of Wilson's disease in the future. This review article discusses both existing vectors and strategies as well as future developments towards liver-directed gene therapy, although there is still a long way to go before gene therapy can be used to safely treat Wilson's disease in humans. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",,"Merle, U.;Stremmel, W.;Encke, J.",2007,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/156652307780859053,0,0,
2008,Zinc and the Liver: An Active Interaction,"Zinc is an essential trace element with important antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. It affects growth and development and is involved in processes such as aging and cancer development. The liver is important in regulating zinc homeostasis while zinc is necessary for proper liver function. Decreased zinc levels have been associated with both acute and chronic liver disease, and zinc deficiency has been linked to the pathogenesis of liver disease. Zinc supplementation provides protection against acute and chronic liver injury in experimental animal models, but these hepatoprotective properties have not been fully elucidated. In the present review, data on zinc homeostasis, its impact on the pathogenesis of liver diseases and its effect on acute and chronic liver diseases are presented. It is concluded that zinc may protect against liver disease, although the underlying pathophysiology of zinc and liver interactions has not yet been defined. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"Stamoulis, I.;Kouraklis, G.;Theocharis, S.",2007,July,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10620-006-9462-0,0,0,

They are present in most organisms and are key elements in metal homeostasis. P 1B -type ATPases contain 6-8 transmembrane fragments bearing signature sequences in segments flanking the large ATP-binding cytoplasmic loop.

2011,"Reversible precipitation of bovine serum albumin by metal ions and synthesis, structure, and reactivity of new tetrathiometalate chelators","Independent research is an important part of any undergraduate chemistry program. This article reports the results of two of the many undergraduate research projects led by Ed Stiefel in the hope that the results will be inspiring and useful to the scientific community. The neurological disorders associated with copper deficiency in Menkes disease and copper excess in Wilson disease are well known; However, recent evidence suggests that copper may also be involved in other diseases such as Alzheimer's, angiogenesis and prion diseases. However, the exact role of copper is uncertain. This study examines the role of copper and zinc in the formation of protein deposits and the chelation and removal of the metal ions to reverse the process. The bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein forms a precipitate after the addition of approximately 6 atoms of copper(II) or 8 atoms of zinc(II). Other metal ions such as Ca(II), Al(III), Ni(II) and Co(II) did not precipitate the BSA even when the metal ion to BSA ratios were over 1000.

The AcCh salts hydrolyzed more slowly than the ammonium or Ch salts, and the tetrathiotungstate salts hydrolyzed about two orders of magnitude slower than the tetrathiomolybdate salts. The slower hydrolysis of tetrathiotungstate may make it more useful as an inorganic reagent and therapeutic agent. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,"Lee, V. E.;Schulman, J. M.;Stiefel, E.

Phenotypic manifestations range from neuropsychiatric disorders to severe liver disease requiring liver transplantation. The clinical presentation is not often related to the genetic defect, and siblings can have different types of diseases. Liver transplantation is indicated in all patients with Wilson's disease and decompensated cirrhosis of the liver who are unresponsive to drug therapy, but its effectiveness in resolving neurological symptoms is still controversial, as widely differing results have been reported to date. We describe here the exceptional case of two homozygous twins, both with liver cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease, one with severe neuropsychiatric involvement, who both underwent liver transplantation and had very different outcomes despite the same genetic background. The presence of neurological clinical manifestations in Wilson's disease should advise caution when specifying liver transplantation since irreversible brain damage may be present. © 2006 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Senzolo, M.;Loreno, M.;Fagiuoli, S.;Zanus, G.;Canova, D.;Masier, A.;Russo, F.

2014,Antitumor and anti-inflammatory effects of tetrathiotungstate compared to tetrathiomolybdate,"Tetrathiomolybdate(TM) is an anti-copper drug in development for the treatment of Wilson's disease. Its mechanism of action involves the formation of a tight three-part complex in the blood with serum albumin and available copper. When available copper levels are decreased in animals with TM, potent antiangiogenic and antitumor effects are observed. Similarly, TM has excellent efficacy in animal models of fibrotic, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases and protects against cardiac damage from doxorubicin (DXR) and liver damage from acetaminophen, carbon tetrachloride, and concanavalin A. Tetrathiotungstate (TT) also forms a similar tripartite complex in the blood and has similar properties Effects like TM on copper. This article evaluated whether TT had similar antitumor effects and similar effects in protecting the heart from DXR toxicity as TM.

2015,"The role of thiols, dithiols, nutritional factors, and interacting ligands in mercury toxicology","Mercury has been known to be a toxin for centuries. While the clinical features of acute mercury poisoning have been well characterized, chronic exposure to low doses of mercury remains poorly characterized and its potential role in various chronic disease states remains controversial. Low molecular weight thiols, ie, sulfhydryl-containing molecules such as cysteine, become important factors in the transport and distribution of mercury throughout the body due to the phenomenon of ""molecular mimicry"" and their role in the molecular transport of mercury. Chelating agents such as the dithiols sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropane sulfate (DMPS) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) are the treatments of choice for mercury toxicity. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a disulfide, and its metabolite, dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), a dithiol, also have chelating properties when used appropriately. While N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH) have historically been recommended for treating mercury toxicity, a review of the available evidence suggests that these agents may actually be counterproductive. Zinc and selenium have also been shown to exert protective effects against mercury toxicity, most likely mediated through induction of the metal-binding proteins metallothionein and selenoprotein-P. However, there is evidence that co-administration of selenium and dithiol chelating agents during treatment may also be counterproductive. Finally, the issue of diagnostic testing for chronic, past, or low-dose mercury poisoning is addressed, including an analysis of the impact of ligand interactions and dietary factors on the accuracy of chelation challenge tests. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Sip1 expression in the dorsal telencephalon of mouse embryos has been documented from E12.5. We specifically inactivated the gene in cortical progenitors. This resulted in the absence of the entire hippocampal formation. Mutated Sip1 mice showed the death of differentiating cells and reduced proliferation in the region of the future hippocampus and dentate gyrus. Expression of the Wnt antagonist Sfrp1 was ectopically activated, while the activity of the noncanonical Wnt effector JNK was downregulated in the embryonic hippocampus of mutant mice. In cortical cells, the Sip1 protein was detected on the promoter of the Sfrp1 gene, and both genes showed a mutually exclusive expression pattern, suggesting that Sfrp1 expression is negatively regulated by Sip1. Sip1 is therefore essential for the development of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus and is able to modulate Wnt signaling in these regions. © 2007 by the US National Academy of Sciences.",,"Miquelajauregui, A.;Van De Putte, T.;Polyakov, A.;Nityanandam, A.;Boppana, S.;Seuntjens, E.;Karabinos, A.;Higashi, Y.;Huylebroeck, D.;Tarabykin, V.",2007,2022-07-31 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0609863104,0,0,
2022,Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale - A proposal for the neurological evaluation of patients with Wilson's disease,"Background and purpose: The clinical forms of the neurological manifestations of Wilson's disease (WD) can be divided into three movement disorder syndromes: a) dystonic, b) atactic, c) Parkinson's disease. These syndromes in WM rarely occur in isolation. Clinical rating scales such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), and the Rating Scale for Dystonia (RSD), which focus on either just parkinsonism or ataxia or dystonia, are insufficient to be accurate to reflect the motor impairment of WM patients. The aim of the study was to develop a novel WM grading scale, as to our knowledge no scale for clinical WM grading has yet been developed. Materials and Methods: In 2004 the EuroWilson consortium was established to create a European WD database. Consortium members from Poland, Germany and France have created a new scale using clinical rating scales such as UPDRS, ICARS and RSD. Worked out drafts were discussed several times in detail at the first international neurological EuroWilson meeting in Paris in September 2004 and in Warsaw in November. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The new scale for WD consists of 3 parts, including: consciousness, a historical overview based on the Barthel scale (2-11 points), and neurological examination (12-35, points). The maximum number of points for the first part is 3, for the second part 39 points and for the last part 143 points. The initial reliability of the scale was assessed using 6 patients (on DVD) and 8 examiners. Interrater agreement was high. Now the scale is used by the EuroWilson and GeNeMove consortiums.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Tarnacka, B.;Moller, J. C.;Leinweber, B.;Bandmann, O.;Woimant, F.;Oertel, W. H.",2007,,,0,0,

Additional neurophysiological investigations and MRI are recommended for the initial assessment and follow-up. Genetic analysis can be helpful in identifying asymptomatic relatives of the index patient.

Our aim was to validate 3 published scoring systems for the decision between chelation treatment and liver transplantation in patients with chronically decompensated and fulminant WM. The Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and the WD Prognostic Index (WPI) and its recently revised version (RWPI) were evaluated as predictors of the safety of chelation therapy. A group of 14 adult patients with cle-compensated chronic MV who improved on penicillamine treatment were compared with 21 patients with fulminant MV. The diagnosis of WM was based on increased urinary copper excretion and was confirmed by increased hepatic copper and/or mutational analysis of the WM gene. The MELD score, WPI and RWPI were calculated for all patients with WD. The accuracy of the MELD score, WPI, and RWPI in predicting response to chelation therapy in patients with decompensated chronic MB was 0.968, 0.980, and 0.993, respectively. None of the decompensated chronic WM patients had a MELD score > 30, RWPI > 11, or WPI > 7. RWPI showed the highest accuracy and lowest false negativity compared to WPI and MELD.

A role for viral suppression with lamivudine during the third trimester has also been suggested in mothers with high viral loads. Hepatic adenoma should be a contraindication for pregnancy or be resected first; It can grow rapidly and rupture with life-threatening intraperitoneal bleeding. Obstetric cholestasis usually manifests itself as itching of the extremities. Ursodeoxycholic acid, 10 mg/kg/day, improved maternal symptoms and biochemistry in a few reported studies, and there were no reports of adverse effects on the baby. The fetus is at increased risk of preterm labor, fetal distress, and stillbirth, but elective delivery at 37-38 weeks avoids these in almost all cases.

Early delivery is helpful, although the condition can progress or even develop de novo after birth, peaking around 48 hours after delivery. Full-blown eclampsia can result in liver rupture with massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage with high mortality. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is serious but rare (1/15,000).

The copper-transporting effect directly supports the production of the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin, into which copper is incorporated, and the excretion of copper in the bile. Consequently, in Wilson's disease, serum concentrations of copper are low and copper retention in the liver develops, leading to liver damage. Wilson disease can present as a hepatic, neurological, or psychiatric condition; The clinical phenotypes are very different. Other organ systems can also be involved. Although the usual age range for clinical presentation is 5 to 45 years, younger children and older adults can present with this disease. Clinical evaluations include liver function tests, cerebral imaging, serum ceruloplasmin and copper, 24-hour basal urinary copper measurement, and hepatic parenchymal copper concentration. Genetic diagnosis is complex and is best used for family studies or in populations known to have a limited repertoire of mutations. Treatment is usually very effective and consists of lifelong administration of a chelating agent (D-penicillamine or trientine) or zinc in pharmacological doses. Liver transplantation is mandatory for patients with fulminant liver failure (coagulopathy, encephalopathy, massive intravascular hemolysis, renal failure, elevated aminotransferases, subnormal alkaline phosphatase) or for patients whose liver disease does not respond to usual treatment. Liver cancer is extremely rare in people with Wilson's disease, but screening may be appropriate in older patients. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,"Roberts, E.

2037,Wilson's disease - A treatable metabolic disease. [German],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper excretion. The clinical manifestation occurs between the 5th and 40th year of life with hepatic or extrapyramidal symptoms and the course of the disease is progressive if the diagnosis is not made early and adequate therapy is not started. The cause of the genetic defect is a mutation in the ATPase 7B gene on chromosome 13, which codes for an enzyme that is necessary for the excretion of copper in the bile. All therapeutic strategies are aimed at a negative copper balance, either through reduced copper absorption (zinc) in the intestine or increased copper excretion (chelating agents D-penicillamine and trientine). The therapy should be chosen with regard to the stage of the disease and the copper metabolism should be checked at regular intervals. © 2007 Schattauer GmbH.",,"Straube, A.;Hermann, W.",2007,,,0,0,

MWS has been reported in association with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). MWS is sometimes difficult to diagnose clinically, especially when HSCR is absent. Therefore, it is necessary to detect gene abnormalities at the molecular level. Here we report two Japanese girls with MWS who presented with a distinctive facial phenotype, severe intellectual disability, and epileptic seizures. Major congenital anomalies of the patients varied widely. Patient 1 suffered from severe congenital heart disease but had no overt HSCR. Patient 2 suffered from typical HSCR and underwent surgery but had no congenital heart disease. According to white blood cell genetic analysis, they had nonsense mutations in ZFHX1B, R695X, and Q433X, respectively. In conclusion, the molecular genetic analysis of ZFHX1B is important for an unambiguous diagnosis of MWS, which presents a broad phenotypic spectrum of congenital abnormalities.",,"Sasongko, T.

2040,"Wilson's disease - A practical approach to diagnosis, treatment and follow-up","Wilson's disease is an inherited, autosomal recessive copper accumulation and toxicity disorder affecting approximately 30 people per million. This rare disease is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, which is important for copper excretion in the bile and leads to copper accumulation in the liver. Toxic levels of copper can also be found in the brain and kidneys, and clinical phenotypes include hepatic, hemolytic, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical features and findings such as increased urinary copper excretion, decreased serum ceruloplasmin, high hepatic copper concentrations, and Kayser-Fleischer rings. Genetic studies are also becoming available for clinical use, but the utility of direct mutation analysis is limited. Wilson's disease can be treated, and early diagnosis is crucial: the goal of therapy is to reduce the accumulation of copper by either increasing urinary excretion or decreasing absorption in the gut. Medical therapies include penicillamine, trientine, zinc, and tetrathiomolibdate.

However, an infectious disease caused by a novel human coronavirus resulted in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This disease first emerged in late 2002 and quickly spread from its origin in southern China to >25 countries during the 2003 epidemic. It affected ~8000 patients resulting in ~800 deaths, a high mortality rate. To combat the disease, scientists have performed cell-based assays to find the inhibitors of viral replication or focused on specific targets to develop their inhibitors as potential therapeutics. A promising target for SARS drug development is a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, a major protease responsible for the maturation of functional proteins in the SARS coronavirus life cycle. Several groups of inhibitors have been identified through high-throughput screening and rational drug design. The inhibitors reported in the literature and described in the patents are summarized in this overview.

Recent human studies have described possible effects of copper on AD pathogenesis. In particular, the evidence accumulated in our laboratory over the past six years indicates that abnormalities in copper distribution arising from fluctuations in blood flow correlate with functional and structural brain deficits in AD. Although this work supports a damaging role for copper, new studies suggest a protective role. In fact, some recent studies have shown that a decrease in human serum copper is correlated with poorer neurobehavioral performance.

Materials and Methods: The new photometric method using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-ascorbic acid to dissociate copper from proteins in acetate buffer (pH 3.2) and nitro-PAPS as a ligand was also adapted to an automated analyzer. Copper concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometric method and by photometric method in 24-hour urine samples from patients (n = 100) with different types of diseases, including Wilson's disease (n = 12), diabetes mellitus (n = 34), osteoporosis (n = 27), nephrotic syndrome (n = 17), and rheumatoid arthritis (n = 10). Results: There was a statistically significant correlation (P<0.01) between our new method and the atomic absorption spectrophotometric method (y=0.994x+0.207, Sy/x=1.776), and the photometric method was linear up to 200 cups/L Concentration.

Materials and Methods: A two-month cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of seven hospital pharmacies in the Lisbon region. The data were collected from the records of the pharmaceutical service. Results: A total of 18 orphan medicinal products were distributed to 355 orphan patients. Most patients were adults (76.4%). Preterm infants and neonates accounted for 50.0% of pediatric patients. Differences between the proportion of male and female patients in the age groups were not found (p = 0.762). Only 18.3% were hospitalized. A high proportion of pediatric inpatients (58.3%) relative to adult inpatients (5.9%) was observed (p=0.001). In general, antineoplastic and immunomodulatory agents for orphan cancers were the most commonly dispensed drugs (51.3%). Regarding pediatrics, caffeine citrate had the higher frequency distribution (57.1%) in primary apnea of preterm infants. Five (71.4%) drugs released for pediatric use do not have marketing authorization and the remaining (28.6%) were used off-label. For pulmonary arterial hypertension, 19 of 27 patients (70.3%) were treated with bosentan. According to the evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, bosentan has a good level of evidence and a significant benefit: recommendation grade A.

Continued progress in the elaboration of the molecular biology, genetics, epidemiology, and treatment of these prototypical hereditary metabolic diseases will be the focus of this review. RECENT RESULTS: Wilson's disease and genetic hemochromatosis involve defects in metal transport with accumulation of copper and iron in hepatocytes, respectively. In alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, hepatocytes accumulate defective alpha-1 antitrypsin, which folds incorrectly. As a more complete picture of the molecular biology of the proteins and genes involved in transport has developed, so has our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these disorders and the diversity of phenotypes observed. Finally, with the elucidation of the cellular basis of these diseases, new ideas for the clinical treatment of these diseases will emerge. SUMMARY: The recent developments described in this article have important implications for the future diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.

2053,"Copper and human health: biochemistry, genetics, and strategies for modeling dose-response relationships","Copper (Cu) and its alloys are used extensively in domestic and industrial applications. Cu is also an essential element in mammalian nutrition. Because both copper deficiency and excess have adverse health effects, the dose-response curve is U-shaped, although the exact shape is not yet well characterized. Many animal and human studies have been performed with copper to provide a rich database from which to extract data suitable for modeling the dose-response relationship for copper. In this review, possible dose-response modeling strategies are considered, including those based on benchmark dose and categorical regression. The usefulness of biologically based dose-response modeling techniques in understanding copper toxicity was difficult to assess at this time, as the mechanisms underlying copper-induced toxicity have yet to be fully elucidated. A dose-response modeling strategy for copper toxicity associated with both deficiency and excess has been proposed. This modeling strategy was applied to several copper-induced toxicity studies, standardized in terms of the severity of adverse events, and selected based on criteria that reflect the quality and relevance of each study. The use of a comprehensive copper-induced toxicity database is essential for dose-response modelling, as there is insufficient information in a single study to adequately characterize the dose-response relationships of copper. The dose-response modeling strategy envisaged here is intended to determine whether the existing toxicity data for copper excess or deficiency can be used effectively to define the limits of the homeostatic range in humans and other species. By considering alternative techniques for determining a baseline and low-dose extrapolation (including categorical regression, the benchmark dose, and identifying observed no-effect levels), this strategy will determine which techniques are most appropriate for this purpose. This analysis also serves to identify areas where additional data is needed to better define the characteristics of dose-response relationships for copper-induced toxicity in terms of excess or deficiency.

In 2001, experts at the 8th International Conference on Wilson's Disease (WD) and Menkes' Disease in Leipzig, Germany, proposed a scoring system that could facilitate the diagnosis of WD. METHODS/RESULTS: Three patients were found to have an atypical WM presentation since they all appeared after the age of 40 years. Two of the three had established cirrhosis and none had any neuropsychiatric manifestations. All three patients met the Leipzig diagnostic criteria proposed by EASL prior to confirmatory mutation analysis. Patient A died of liver failure despite treatment. Patients B and C remained on chelation therapy with stable liver disease. Conclusions: We believe that these patients represent a group most likely to be missed in the diagnostic work-up for liver disease due to a combination of atypical features such as older age of onset, presence of other confounders for liver disease, and sometimes absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings.

2061,The onset of psychiatric disorders and Wilson's disease. [French],"Wilson disease is a rare, autosomal recessive pathology resulting from a loss of function of an adenosine triphosphatase (ATP7B or WDNP) secondary to an alteration (more than 60 are currently described), insertion or deletion of the ATP7B gene related to located on chromosome 13q14.3-q21.1, which involves a reduction or absence of copper transport in bile and its accumulation in the body, particularly in the brain. Wilson disease is transmitted by an autosomal recessive gene located on the long arm of chromosome 13. The prevalence of heterozygotes is estimated at 1/90 and that of homozygotes at 1/30,000. Consanguinity, common in the socially geographically isolated populations, increases the prevalence of the disease. The toxic levels of copper that accumulate in the liver from infancy and perhaps even before remain concentrated in the body for years. Therefore, cytological and histological changes can be detected in the biopsies before clinical or biological signs of liver damage appear. The accumulation of copper in the liver is due to a defect in biliary metal excretion and is always accompanied by a deficit in ceruloplasmin; Protein synthesized from a transferred ATP7B gene that causes retention of copper ions in the liver. There are two types of detectable cellular abnormalities: liver lesions, leading to acute hepatic failure, acute hepatitis, and eventually advanced cirrhosis, and central nervous system lesions, responsible for the neurological and psychiatric disorders. In about 40-50% of patients, the initial manifestation of Wilson's disease affects the central nervous system. Although copper diffuses to the blood in the liver and then to other tissues, it is only in the brain that it has catastrophic results. It can therefore cause either progressive neurological disease or psychiatric disorders. Wilson's disease begins in at least 90% of patients as a hepatic, neurological, or psychiatric disorder. In some rare cases, the first manifestations of the disease can be psychiatric, accounting for only 10% of cases according to the literature. The disease can be revealed by isolated behavior problems, an irrational syndrome, a schizophrenic syndrome, or a manic-depressive syndrome. Damage to the central nervous system can be more severe, so several differential diagnoses have been discussed: * a late-onset psychotic disorder; * a depressive state; * a mental confusion disorder. The clinical syndrome is complex. In fact, it is polymorphism that dominates the description of psychiatric manifestations. This can lead to adverse diagnostic biases, especially as heavy sedative treatment may be required to suppress behavioral problems. Clinically, Wilson's disease generally occurs between the ages of 10 and 20. Rarely does he remain masked until after the age of 40. The first manifestations are hepatic (40% of cases), neurological (35%) or psychiatric (10%). Finally, in about 15% of cases, the primary disease can take on a haematological, renal or mixed form. We have detailed the main clinical elements. In about 40-50% of patients, the first manifestation of the disease affects the central nervous system, where it can cause either progressive neurological disease or psychiatric disorders. The ophthalmologic disorder is dominated by the Kayser-Fleischer ring, which is a green or bronze ring at the periphery of the cornea. It occupies the upper pole of the cornea, then the lower pole and extends along the entire perimeter. It is usually only visible under examination with a slit lamp. It disappears on average within 3-5 years after copper chelation therapy. The Kayser-Fleischer ring has been described in exceptional cases of prolonged cholestasis, with the exception of Wilson's disease. At the hematological level, hyperhemolysis is due to the toxicity of ionic copper, which is massively released in plasma through hepatocellular necrosis. The other manifestations are found in the following organs: renal, osteoarticular, cardiac, endocrine, cutaneous and in the teguments. Until 1952, the diagnosis was only made on the basis of the clinical symptoms. From now on, it can be clearly characterized by the description of a ceruloplasmin plasma concentration of less than 200 ml/l and a Kayser-Fleischer ring even without symptoms. The hepatic copper in the sample is constantly increased (from 3 to 25 mmol/g dry weight) during the disease. On the other hand, the absence of a decrease in plasma ceruloplasmin does not exclude the diagnosis. Conversely, except in Wilson's disease (nephritic syndrome, malabsorption syndrome, or severe hepatic insufficiency), there may be a decrease in ceruloplasmin. The Kayser-Fleischer ring is virtually constant in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms (therefore its absence represents a very strong argument against diagnosis). On the other hand, it can be absent in hepatic forms, and in this case its absence does not argue against the diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging can show abnormal signals from the gray nuclei. If there is a family history, genetic testing is performed by liaison analysis. Left untreated, Wilson's disease leads to tissue lesions, the outcome of which is always fatal. Treatment relies on regulation of copper chelation, which improves prognosis, and zinc, which scavenges the copper in a non-toxic form. The severe psychiatric disorders seen during Wilson's disease may require sedatives, but caution is advised because of possible neurological or hepatic side effects. Lithium appears to be an interesting treatment and remains theoretically indicated, considering the rarity of extrapyramidal symptoms and hepatic dysfunction in cirrhotic patients, since it is not metabolized in the liver. Although rare, it is important to approach Wilson disease in psychiatry, since the psychiatric manifestations may precede the somatic disorders and help establish the diagnosis. We emphasize the importance of early diagnosis of pathology, the outcome of which is fatal without specific treatment. Â© 2007 L'Encephale, Paris, 2007.",,"Benhamla, T.;Tirouche, Y.

Diagnosis is based on low serum levels of ceruloplasmin and copper, elevated serum transaminases, increased 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and increased hepatic copper levels. However, there can be pitfalls with this diagnostic puzzle. Haplotype analysis allows diagnosis in presymptomatic siblings of an index patient.

Oxidative stress can be defined as the imbalance between cellular production of oxidative species and antioxidant capacity shifted towards the former. Lipid peroxidation is one of the processes that take place during oxidative stress. Lipid peroxidation products such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) are closely related to carcinogenesis as they are potent mutagens and have been proposed as modulators of signaling pathways related to proliferation and apoptosis, two processes involved in carcinogenesis . Mechanisms by which oxidative stress leads to tumor formation are still under investigation. The need for suitable in vivo models that could reflect inflammation-related human carcinogenesis is evident. In this regard, the Long Evans cinnamon-like (LEC) rat mutant strain offers a promising model to study the relationship between hepatitis induced by oxidative stress and hepatocarcinogenesis, as it has been shown to induce spontaneous liver tumor formation associated with copper accumulation and stress developed by oxidative stress. In this review, the results on oxidative stress and its relation to liver pathologies in LEC rats are discussed; We focus on the mechanisms proposed for HNE carcinogenesis. © WS Maney & Son Ltd.",,"Marquez, A.;Villa-Trevino, S.;Gueraud, F.",2007,February,http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/135100007X162220,0,0,
2064,Treatable hereditary neurometabolic disorders. [French],"Hereditary metabolic diseases can appear in adolescence or young adulthood and manifest themselves as an apparently unexplained neurological or psychiatric disorder. Certain metabolic disorders are responsive to specific treatments and should be recognized early, particularly in emergency situations where prompt initiation of treatment can prevent fatal outcomes or irreversible neurological damage. The main diseases leading to acute neurological syndrome in adults are urea cycle disorders, homocysteine metabolism disorders and porphyria. More rarely, Wilson's disease, amino acid disorders, organic aciduria or pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, beta-oxidation disorders, or biotin metabolism may be involved. Most emergency situations can be correctly screened with simple tests (serum ammonia, homocysteine, lactate, urinary prophyrins, acylcarnitine pattern, amino acid and organic acid chromatography). In chronic situations, the main treatable diseases are Wilson's disease, homocysteine, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Refsum's disease, vitamin E deficiency, Gaucher's disease, Fabry's disease and disorders of neurotransmitter metabolism.

2065,Effect of penicillamine and zinc on iron metabolism in Wilson's disease,"objective. The physiology of iron metabolism in Wilson's disease is largely unknown, and there is little data on the actual presence and progression of iron accumulation. The purpose of this study was to determine parameters of iron metabolism, including hepatic iron concentration, in subsequent liver biopsies and serum, and urinary pro-hepcidin. Material and methods. 23 patients with Wilson's disease who were undergoing long-term treatment were included in the study. Results. Hepatic iron levels were significantly increased in penicillamine-treated patients compared to zinc-treated patients. Serum and urine pro-hepcidin concentrations were significantly higher in patients with Wilson's disease than in healthy subjects, despite a normal biochemical pattern of iron metabolism. Conclusions. Long-term treatment with penicillamine appears to be responsible for increased hepatic iron accumulation. This observation may warrant a review of long-term treatment modalities of Wilson's disease with penicillamine. The finding that serum and urinary pro-hepcidin is significantly elevated in patients with Wilson's disease compared to healthy subjects suggests a role for hepcidin in iron metabolism in Wilson's disease, but this needs to be supported by a study of hepatic hepcidin expression in these patients are confirmed. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.",,"Medici, V.;Leo, V.

2069,Whipple's triad as a clinical manifestation of hepatolenticular degeneration. [Polishing],"Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) is a rare condition characterized by a disorder of biliary copper excretion, leading to excessive copper accumulation and toxicity. The most common symptoms of this disorder include hepatic, neurological, or psychiatric disorders, although other less common clinical features can sometimes be present. Since the clinical presentation of the disease is very heterogeneous, it can mimic the symptoms of many different diseases. The diagnosis of the condition depends mainly on clinical features, biochemical parameters and the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring. Early detection and treatment protect patients from devastating organ damage. We describe an atypical case of Wilson's disease in a 23-year-old woman whose clinical picture suggested the presence of an insulin-producing tumor. After the diagnosis was made and zinc sulfate treatment was performed, her clinical condition improved remarkably. The presented case suggests that hepatolenticular degeneration should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hypoglycemia of unknown origin.

[German],"Wilson disease is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by a defect in a copper-transporting ATPase that binds copper to apoceruloplasmin, which facilitates excretion of copper in the bile. The result is accumulation of copper in multiple organs. The resulting clinical syndrome is mainly characterized by hepatic dysfunction. However, neurological and psychiatric symptoms are common and may be the first clinical manifestations. Although Wilson disease is rare, psychiatrists should be aware of this diagnosis because - with early treatment - the prognosis is favorable and permanent organ damage or fatal consequences can often be avoided. Wilson's disease seems to be an important differential diagnosis, especially in younger patients with the onset of psychiatric symptoms.

2071,Wilson's disease: an update. [Korean],"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper transport resulting in accumulation of copper primarily in the liver, brain, and cornea. WD is the most common inherited liver disease with a prevalence of 1 in 37,000 in the pediatric population in Korea. Mutations in the ATP7B gene lead to a failure of copper excretion in the bile and incorrect incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin. To date, more than 300 mutations in the ATP7B gene have been described. Mutations differ between ethnic groups. p.R778L (an allele frequency of 37%), p.A874V (13%), p.L1083F (8%) and p.N1270S (6%) are the most common major mutations in Korea. Conflicting results on genotype/phenotype correlations of the most common mutations have been reported in different countries. There appears to be no correlation between R778L mutation and age at onset or clinical manifestations in Korean patients. No laboratory parameter alone allows a definitive diagnosis of WM. In a nationwide study by WD, low serum ceruloplasmin (< 20 mg/dl), high 24-hour urine copper (> 100 micrograms), high hepatic copper (> 250 micrograms/g dried liver), and Kayser-Fleischer rings were found in 96%, 86%, 88%, and 73% of the 550 Korean patients, respectively. A combination of any two of the above 4 laboratory findings is strong support for the diagnosis of WM. In recent years, genetic testing has played an increasingly important role in diagnosing WM. Direct DNA sequencing confirmed WD in 98% of Korean patients. Two mutations were detected in 70% and one mutation in 28% of patients who presented biochemical and clinical findings characteristic of WM. Genetic testing, either by haplotype analysis or by mutation analysis, is the only reliable means of distinguishing heterozygous carriers from affected asymptomatic patients. The drugs of first choice among chelating agents and zinc in certain clinical settings of WM are still controversial. Due to frequent side effects and initial neurological deterioration of penicillamine therapy, penicillamine has gradually been replaced by the less toxic trientine or zinc in recent years. Trientine or tetrathiomolybdate is increasingly recommended as first-line treatment for neurological WM. Currently, liver transplantation is not recommended as the primary treatment for neurological WM. Recently published data show that initial zinc therapy in asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic patients and maintenance zinc therapy in patients after long-term chelation are safe and effective. More research and the new guidelines on how to properly treat patients with WM are needed.",,"Seo, J. K.",2006,Sep,,0,0,
2072,Reversible dementia and treatable dementia. [Spanish],"Introduction. When examining patients with dementia, the search for reversible or treatable entities plays a fundamental role. Many patients fail to reach previous cognitive levels; however, this does not mean that the disease is not treatable with partial recovery or prevention of secondary progression. Development. The prevalence of reversible dementia is around 15% in most series. Routine studies include complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, electrolyte and chemistry panel, liver function tests, serum vitamin B12 and folate levels, urinalysis, and syphilis serology. Specific tests such as thyroid function tests, protein electrophoresis, human immunodeficiency virus serology, serum heavy metal levels, electrocardiography, CSF analysis, and chest X-ray should be performed according to the patient's clinical profile. Neuroimaging should be performed in any case. First, a non-contrast computed tomography must be performed. Magnetic resonance imaging is most useful for looking for more subtle structural anomalies. Electroencephalogram, positron emission tomography, and single photon emission computed tomography are not recommended as routine investigations. In a few cases, a brain biopsy is indicated. Conclusion. Some of the most common causes of reversible and treatable dementia include: medications, obstructive hydrocephalus, infectious, vascular, immunological, psychiatric, toxic, and metabolic disorders. © 2006, Revista de Neurologia.",,"Senties-Madrid, H.;Estanol-Vidal, B.",2006,July,,0,0,

Serum levels of ceruloplasmin were low, but urinary copper excretion was not appreciably increased. He was treated with D-penicillamine. He was then referred to our clinic because of his facial features indicative of mucopolysaccharidosis. The diagnosis of Sanfilippo syndrome type B was made on the basis of mucopolysacchariduria and N-acetylglucosaminidase deficiency. Molecular analyzes identified him as a composite heterozygote for both the ATP7B (A844V/2659delG) and alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (V241M/R482W) genes, which are responsible for Wilson's disease and Sanfilippo syndrome type B, respectively.

2076,Disorders responsive to B<inf>6</inf>: A model of vitamin dependency,"Pyridoxal phosphate is the cofactor for over 100 enzyme-catalyzed reactions in the body, including many involved in the synthesis or breakdown of neurotransmitters. Inadequate levels of pyridoxal phosphate in the brain cause neurological dysfunction, particularly epilepsy. There are several mechanisms that lead to an increased need for pyridoxine and/or pyridoxal phosphate. These include: (i) congenital defects affecting pathways of B<inf>6</inf> vitamer metabolism; (ii) congenital defects leading to the accumulation of small molecules that react with and inactivate pyridoxal phosphate; (iii) drugs that react with pyridoxal phosphate; (iv) celiac disease, which is thought to result in malabsorption of B6 vitamins; (v) renal dialysis leading to increased losses of B6 vitamins from circulation; (vi) drugs affecting the metabolism of B6 vitamins; and (vii) congenital defects affecting certain pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzymes. The latter show a very variable degree of responsiveness to pyridoxine, from 90% in X-linked sideroblastic anemia (delta aminolevulinic acid deficiency) to 50% in homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency) to 5% in ornithinaemia with gyrate atrophy ( ornithine delta synthase deficiency). -aminotransferase deficiency). The possible role of pyridoxal phosphate as a chaperone during folding of nascent enzymes is discussed. High doses of pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate can cause harmful side effects (particularly peripheral neuropathy with pyridoxine) and this must be taken into account in treatment. Nonetheless, treatment with pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate can be life-saving in some patients, particularly infants with intractable epilepsy, and in other infants with congenital metabolic disorders, B6 treatment can be extremely beneficial. © SSIEM and Springer 2006.",,"Clayton, P.

2077,Zinc requirements and the risks and benefits of zinc supplementation,"Adult humans contain 2-3 g of zinc, of which around 0.1% is supplemented daily. Based on this, and based on estimates of the bioavailability of zinc, dietary recommendations are made for apparently healthy individuals. The absence of chemical, functional and/or physical evidence of zinc deficiency is taken as an indication of adequacy. More precise data are rarely available. Changing food preferences and availability, as well as new technologies for food preparation, preservation and processing, may require a re-evaluation of previous data. Conservative estimates place {greater than or slanted equal to} 25% of the world's population at risk of zinc deficiency. Most affected individuals are poor and rarely consume foods rich in highly bioavailable zinc, while consuming foods rich in zinc absorption inhibitors and/or relatively low levels of bioavailable zinc. In contrast, among the relatively affluent, food choice is an important factor influencing the risk of zinc deficiency. An additional concern, particularly among the relatively affluent, is the risk of chronic zinc toxicity caused by overconsumption of zinc supplements. A high intake of zinc relative to copper can lead to copper deficiency. A major challenge that has not yet been resolved for maximum health benefit is the proximity of the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) and Reference Dose (RfD) for safe intake of zinc. The present recommendations do not take into account the numerous dietary factors affecting the bioavailability of zinc and copper and the likelihood of toxicity of zinc supplements. Therefore, the currently accepted range between safe and safe zinc intake is relatively narrow. Currently, the assessment of zinc nutrition is complex and involves a range of chemical and functional measurements that have limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. This approach needs to be improved so that zinc deficiency or excess can be detected early. An increasing number of associations between disease and zinc status and seemingly normal health conditions where supplemental zinc might be effective to prevent certain conditions point to the pharmacology of zinc compounds as a promising area. For example, the relationship between zinc and diabetes mellitus is an area where research could prove fruitful. In our opinion, a multidisciplinary approach will most likely lead to success in this fertile area of translational research. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",,"Maret, W.;Sandstead, H.

2079,"Non-surgical, potentially reversible dementias. [Spanish]","Goals. In this study, we examine dementia that is potentially reversible. The article summarizes the causes that absolutely must be treated with medication, while causes of an operative nature are dealt with in a second article. These papers seek to avoid misdiagnosis and labeling in patients with high potential for improvement in their cognitive disorder and guide us toward more appropriate treatment. Development. Dementia is a public health problem, mainly in countries with long life expectancies. It has an incidence of 3-11% in patients over 65 years of age and 20-50% in patients over 85 years of age. Most of them (50-70%) suffer from dementia of the Alzheimer type, followed by the vascular type (20%); There is a smaller percentage of cases of what are known as subcortical dementia and also those due to medical and/or surgical conditions that indicate possible reversibility. These latter cases are not easy to detect and their incidence ranges from 0 to 37% depending on the series. Once diagnosed, it is difficult to say whether they will actually turn out to be reversible. Their most common causes, such as deficiency symptoms, metabolic disorders, chronic diseases, toxins, etc., must be identified as early as possible, which can be done through clinical observation and laboratory work. Conclusions. Although the potential for improvement in patients diagnosed with reversible dementia is still debated, this brief overview will help us in our quest for its causes and treatment, since late detection and treatment are very likely the cause of a poor outcome. © 2005, Revista de Neurologia.",,"Barquet-Platon, E.

Here we examined the effect of copper accumulation in the tx mouse on zinc and iron metabolism. Copper, zinc and iron concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy in the liver, kidneys, spleen and brain of control and copper-exposed animals. Copper concentration increased dramatically in the liver and was also significantly higher in the spleen, kidney and brain of control tx mice in the first few months of life compared to normal DL mice. Hepatic zinc was increased with age in the tx mouse, but zinc concentrations in other organs were normal. Liver and kidney iron concentrations were significantly lower at birth in tx mice but increased rapidly to be comparable to control mice at 2 months of age. Splenic iron concentration was significantly higher in tx mice but lower in 5-day-old tx puppies. Copper loading studies showed that normal DL mice consuming 300 mg/L copper in their diet for 3 months maintained normal liver, kidney and brain copper, zinc and iron levels. Copper loading of tx mice did not increase the already high liver copper concentrations, but copper concentrations in the spleen and brain were increased. Despite a significant increase in brain copper in the copper-loaded tx mice, no behavioral changes were observed. The liver of copper-loaded tx mice had a lower zinc concentration than control tx mice, while the kidney had twice the iron concentration, suggesting that there was increased erythrocyte hemolysis in the copper-loaded mutants. ©Springer 2006.",,"Allen, K.

Current knowledge shows that fibrosis is part of the liver repair process, which is dynamic. Understanding this repair process will provide better approaches to stop, ameliorate, or reverse fibrosis. Diagnosis of cirrhosis is currently made by liver biopsy and can be confirmed by imaging in most advanced cases. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard, but has several limitations: sampling error, size of the biopsy, and inconsistencies between and within the observer. Therefore, many patients may be inaccurately graded for the degree of fibrosis at their initial biopsy as well as at subsequent re-examination. Although a 1-level decrease between consecutive biopsies may be due to sampling error, a 2-level decrease in cirrhosis is more likely to represent reversal of cirrhosis. Several cases of regression of cirrhosis associated with various liver diseases have been reported. Resolution of fibrosis in most of these disorders is related to successful treatment of the underlying etiology (eg, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, iron overload, Wilson's disease, alcohol abstinence, metabolic syndrome in fatty liver disease, and decompression of biliary obstruction). .

2091,Wilson disease. [French],"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive copper overload. A key feature of this disease is its wide phenotypic and genotypic variability. It results from mutations in the ATP 7B gene on chromosome 13, which codes for a hepatic copper transport protein. More than 300 mutations of this gene have been identified. This protein ensures the transport of copper into the hepatocytes, its incorporation with apoceruloplasmin and its biliary excretion. The clinical manifestations are also heterogeneous in their presentation, dominated by the neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms, as well as the age of the first symptoms. Early detection and initiation of therapy with chelating agents or zinc are essential for the prognosis. Liver transplantation is indicated for fulminant hepatitis, end-stage liver cirrhosis and should be considered for treatment-resistant neurological forms. Regular follow-up with monitoring of treatment side effects and compliance is essential. Any discontinuation of treatment results in a recurrence or renewed worsening of symptoms over a very variable but constant manner.

A 52-year-old man was diagnosed with genetic hemochromatosis. Among his siblings, a 57-year-old sister and a 55-year-old brother had decreased serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels and increased urinary copper excretion. The sister shared the same human leukocyte antigen haplotypes and, like the propositus, was homozygous for the HFE mutation C282Y. However, she had normal liver iron levels and elevated liver copper levels. Your dietary copper intake was probably excessive. The association of Wilson's disease and genetic hemochromatosis is rare and has only been described twice.

2097,Pediatric Liver Transplant. Introduction of a program for southern Germany in Heidelberg,"In Germany, pediatric liver transplantation is performed exclusively in four centers in northern Germany. We report our experience of running a new pediatric liver transplant program in Heidelberg for children from southern Germany. In a pilot phase, we transplanted eight children using different transplantation techniques including reduced size, left lateral split (segments 2 and 3) and full left split (segments 1-4). All transplants were successful. No vascular complications occurred. The immunosuppressive regimen we used was cyclosporine A and methylprednisolone. The rate of acute rejection was three out of eight patients. No patient required retransplantation. One patient died from severe fungal sepsis contracted prior to transplantation. We conclude that a new program for pediatric liver transplantation can be successfully established in a multidisciplinary approach with careful patient selection. © 2006 Blackwell Munksgaard.",,"Engelmann, G.;Meyburg, J.;Schmidt, J.;Lenhartz, H.",2006,December,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-0012.2006.00611.x,0,0,
2098,Influence of chirality on drug action,"The biological activity of a drug molecule is usually initiated through its interaction with receptors. The effect induced by the drug depends on the affinity of the drug molecule for its specific receptor. For chiral receptors such as receptor proteins, the chirality of the interacting molecule plays a major role in defining biological activity in terms of the molecule's affinity for the receptor and subsequent drug action. The biological activity of a racemate is in most cases the contribution of one active enantiomer, while the other enantiomer can be an undesirable commodity. In some cases, different enantiomers can have different activities. Therefore, a recent trend in drug development is to use the active enantiomer as a drug to avoid unnecessarily burdening the body with the inactive or unwanted ingredient. To meet this requirement, newer technologies for chiral separation of molecules have been developed.",,"Sangita;Ray, S.",2006,April,,0,0,

All LEC rats showed higher locomotor activity, reduced habituation to the startle response, or lower PPI compared to Wistar rats, regardless of treatment. The copper content of all examined brain regions except the medulla oblongata of LEC rats was significantly lower than that of Wistar rats. In addition, lower levels of norepinephrine and higher levels of dopamine and serotonin were observed in the striatum and nucleus accumbens of LEC rats compared to Wistar rats. Although copper supplementation did not affect brain copper levels, it reduced PPI in both Wistar and LEC rats. In contrast, D-penicillamine supplementation decreased both brain copper levels and locomotor activity and enhanced startle amplitude only in Wistar rats. These results suggest that an imbalance in copper homeostasis affects monoamine metabolism and behavioral functions. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

2103,"Copper in medicine: homeostasis, chelation therapy, and antitumor drug design","As one of the most important essential transition metals, copper is involved in a variety of biological processes such as embryonic development, connective tissue formation, temperature control and nerve cell function. It is also associated with serious illnesses such as Wilson's and Menkes' disease and some neurological disorders. Novel components of copper homeostasis include copper-transporting P-type ATPases, Menkes and Wilson proteins, and copper chaperones that have been identified in humans and characterized at the molecular level. These results have paved the way for a better understanding of the role of copper deficiency or copper toxicity in physiological and pathological conditions. Therefore, organic compounds that can disrupt copper homeostasis may find therapeutic application in copper-dependent diseases. The antitumor activity of copper complexes was reported several decades ago, and many new complexes have shown great antitumor potential. Copper complexes may have relatively fewer side effects than platinum-based drugs and are thought to be able to overcome inherited or acquired resistance to cisplatin.

2105,Treatment of Wilson's disease with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate - IV. Comparison of tetrathiomolybdate and trientine in a double-blind study for the treatment of the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease,"Aim: To compare tetrathiomolybdate and trientine in the treatment of patients with the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease in terms of frequency of neurological deterioration, side effects, and degree of neurological recovery. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, controlled, two-arm study in 48 patients with the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease. Patients received either trientine hydrochloride 500 mg bid or tetrathiomolybdate 20 mg tid with meals and 20 mg tid between meals for 8 weeks. All patients received zinc 50 mg twice daily. Patients were hospitalized for 8 weeks, with neurological and language function assessed weekly; discharged who were taking zinc 50 mg three times a day and returned annually for follow-up. Setting: A university hospital referral setting. Patients: Mainly newly diagnosed Wilson's disease patients with neurological symptoms and treated with an anticopper drug for no more than 4 weeks. Intervention: Treatment with either trientine plus zinc or tetrathiomolybdate plus zinc. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Neurological function was assessed by semi-quantitative neurological and verbal assessments. Adverse drug events were assessed using blood cell counts and biochemical measurements. Results: Six of 23 patients in the trientine arm and 1 of 25 patients in the tetrathiomolybdate arm experienced neurological deterioration (p<0.05). Three patients receiving tetrathiomolybdate had adverse reactions of anemia and/or leukopenia and 4 had additional transaminase elevations. One patient receiving trientine had anemia as a side effect. Four patients receiving trientine died during follow-up, 3 had shown initial neurological deterioration.

2106,Genetic disorders of copper metabolism. [Japanese],"Genetic disorders of copper metabolism in mainly Menkes' disease and Wilson's disease were reviewed. Menkes disease is caused by a mutation in the ATP7A gene and shows X-linked inheritance. In this disease, the absorption of copper in the intestine is disturbed, resulting in a copper deficiency. The clinical features, including neurological degeneration, connective tissue abnormalities, and hair abnormalities, appear by 2-3 months of age. The serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin are significantly low, while the copper concentration in the cultured fibroblasts is very high. The previously accepted treatment is parenteral administration of copper. If treatment is started during the neonatal period, the neurological degeneration could be prevented. Wilson's disease caused by mutation in ATP7B gene shows autosomal recessive inheritance and the prevalence rate is high. This disease is associated with the toxic effects of copper, which accumulates in many tissues, including the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea. The serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin are significantly low, while the copper concentration in the liver is very high. The diagnosis is made by finding increased urinary copper excretion and hepatic copper accumulation. Genetic analysis is also available for diagnosis. All patients should be treated with chelating agents or zinc. However, some patients with neurological disorders respond poorly to these treatments. Also, these treatments are ineffective in patients with fulminant liver failure. Liver transplantation is now accepted in these patients. In these patients, too, the disorders can be prevented by early treatment with chelating agents or zinc. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are most important for Menkes disease and Wilson disease.",,"Kodama, H.",2006,January,,0,0,

[Chinese],"Aim: To review the clinical and neuropathological changes at autopsy of a patient with Menkes disease who was misdiagnosed as having Wilson's disease and to reveal the clinical and neuropathological differences between these two disorders. METHODS AND RESULTS: An 8-year-old girl gradually presented with lower limb weakness, multiple joint deformities, both hands as claw-like ulnar drift deformity, osteoporosis, limb canal rigidity, tremor, dysphasia, and mental retardation. She had a high arch of the palate, bleeding gums, nosebleeds and urinary retention, etc. Physical Examination: The patient is unable to complete the alternating motion test with both hands, the heel-knee-shin test and the finger-nose test and exhibited a pyramidal sign. Laboratory investigation: serum ceruloplasmin was 0.02 mumol/l. Clinical diagnosis: hepatolenticular degeneration (also called Wilson's disease) complicated by osteopathy. Treated with D-penicillamine (0.3 g) oral dose 3/d. Signs and symptoms progressively worsened. She died at the age of 16. Neuropathological results of autopsy: The cerebral parenchyma showed extensive atrophy, the bilateral subcortical white matter of the frontoparietal lobe showed severe atrophy, degeneration and cavitation. Light microscopic observation: no obvious changes in the tissue of the basal ganglia were seen. Occasionally, an irregular vessel lumen and endangial shrinkage can be found. In the cortex, granule cell layer neurons were evidently reduced and the white matter showed extensive demyelinated degeneration with vesicular formation. Massive astrocytes, phagocytes, ectopic neurons and satellite cells proliferated without infiltration of perivascular inflammatory cells. Neuron loss and necrosis were not seen in the head of the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus and thalamus, but satellite cells around the neurons were markedly increased. There were many activated microgliocytes. Deposits could be found in the neurons at the end of the caudate nucleus. No Opaski cells and Alzheimer type II cells were seen. The characteristic changes in the cerebellum were as follows: residual Purkinje cells showed apparent abnormal dendritic branching (so-called ""weeping willow""), increased perisomatic processes, and focal axonal swelling (""torpedoes""); and Purkinje cells deposited in the granule cell layer. Conclusion: 1) Menkes disease can be observed in women and can begin in childhood or early adulthood. 2) There are prominent massive white matter degeneration, necrosis and cavitation. The structure of the basal ganglia, which is still fairly well preserved, is at odds with the clinical signs and symptoms. Neurons in the granular cell layer of the cortex are significantly reduced. Purkinje cells of the cerebellum produce abnormal dendritic branching. All these are the characteristic manifestations of Menkes disease.",,"Gao, J.;Guo, Y. P.;Gao, S. F.;Zhang, Z. X.;Huang, H.

Urinary copper excretion and ceruloplasmin levels were indicative of Wilson's disease. Despite chelation therapy, no improvement was observed. The plasma exchange therapy was carried out for seven days. Her clinical condition improved and a transplant was no longer necessary.

At first movement, neurological symptoms were misinterpreted as an adverse reaction to haloperidol, but a consulted neurologist suggested an additional diagnostic procedure that confirmed Wilson's disease. Psychiatric symptoms and abnormal involuntary movements were the clinical manifestations of this disease, which improved with neuroleptic and chelating treatment. An interdisciplinary approach with good collaboration between psychiatrists and neurologists is crucial in Wilson's disease because early diagnosis and prompt treatment are critical to prognosis. This case is a reminder that involuntary movements can be a side effect of antipsychotic drugs, but also the clinical manifestation of some diseases, for example Wilson's, Huntington's and Fuhr's disease.

2114,Inherited metabolic liver disease,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in understanding of the molecular machinery involved in the pathogenesis of genetic hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. This year saw further advances in the elaboration of the molecular biology, genetics, epidemiology and treatment of these inherited metabolic diseases. RECENT RESULTS: Both Wilson's disease and genetic hemochromatosis involve defects in the transport of heavy metals and their accumulation in hepatocytes. Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency leads to intrahepatocyte accumulation of defective alpha1-antitrypsin. As a more complete picture of the molecular biology of proteins and genes involved in transport has developed, so has our understanding of their interactions. The molecular genetics of these diseases explain the different phenotypes observed. Finally, the elucidation of the molecular pathophysiology of these diseases has led to new ideas in their clinical management. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The recent developments described in this article have important implications for the future.

2116,Comparison of copper reduction with tetrathiomolybdate and zinc in mouse tumor and doxorubicin models,"Tetrathiomolybdate(TM), presumably by lowering copper levels and availability, has shown excellent efficacy in animal models of cancer and injury models that produce fibrotic or inflammatory damage in the lungs, heart and liver. Studies in human patients are ongoing. If TM's effectiveness is indeed based on lowering copper levels, other anti-copper medications should be just as effective. Zinc is an anticopper drug with proven efficacy in Wilson's disease, a copper toxicity condition. In this study, the efficacy of zinc versus TM is compared in a mouse tumor model and in the doxorubicin model of heart damage, and it is hypothesized that if copper availability were reduced by the same extent, the two drugs would show equal efficacy. No effect of zinc on inhibiting the growth of a tumor markedly inhibited by TM was found, and zinc was found to be less potent than TM in inhibiting doxorubicin cardiac damage. This study demonstrates that the mechanism of action of TM in protecting against doxorubicin toxicity is due to its anticopper action, as copper supplementation removes the protective effects of TM. It is also believed that the differences between TM and zinc may be caused by TM's mechanism of action, where it already binds copper in the body while zinc does not. © 2006 Mosby, Inc.

2119,Metabolic diseases of the liver. [Croatian],"The most common metabolic liver diseases are Wilson's disease (WD), hemochromatosis and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. WD is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that results in accumulation in the body, leading to a range of possible hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric sequelae. Hemochromatosis is the most common genetic disorder in white people of Northern European descent. The characteristics of iron overload are often not recognized and only diagnosed in the context of advanced disease. Left untreated, WD and hemochromatosis are fatal conditions. On the other hand, patients who are identified early and treated with copper/iron reduction therapy, including penicillamine/phlebotomy, can have a normal life expectancy. Given the genetic basis of the condition, it is vital that counseling and evaluation of the patient's first-degree relatives is undertaken. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is the most common childhood metabolic liver disease.

The irradiation of samples with an X-ray beam is the basis of X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM). This technique offers the excellent sensitivity to trace elements; and, due to the large penetration depth of hard X-rays, a way to image whole cells and quantify elements per cell. In addition, since samples prepared for XFM do not need to be sectioned, they can be examined in near-natural, hydrated state using cryogenic approaches. Until a few years ago, XFM was not widely used by biomedical communities and rarely offered resolutions greater than several microns. This changed drastically with the development of third generation synchrotrons.

Future developments of XFM - the construction of new XFM facilities with higher resolution, higher sensitivity or higher throughput will further advance the studies of the natural elemental composition of cells and provide the biological community, including the emerging field of bionanotechnology, with a tool that is perfectly suited to monitor the distribution of metals including nanovectors and measure the results of the interactions between the nanovectors and living cells and tissues. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Paunesku, T.;Vogt, S.;Maser, J.;Lai, B.;Woloschak, G.",2006,2022-12-15 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcb.21047,0,0,
2121,Wilson's Disease: An Update for Clinical Biochemists,"Wilson disease (WD) is a member of a family of genetic disorders characterized by impaired copper metabolism. Inheritance is autosomal recessive, and mutations result in dysfunction of a key copper-transporting protein, the p-type ATPase ATP-7B. The result is accumulation of copper in susceptible tissues, particularly the liver and basal ganglia of the brain, which in turn can lead to symptomatic hepatic and/or neuropsychiatric disorders. Patients with liver disease typically appear in the first two decades of life, while those with primarily neurological manifestations tend to present later. Presentation with fulminant hepatic failure due to hepatic decompensation may necessitate liver transplantation. Hemolytic disease is a rare complaint. Although laboratory studies have traditionally focused on measuring serum free and total copper and ceruloplasmin and urinary copper levels both with and without penicillamine challenge, recent reports indicate that genotyping studies may play a role in the diagnosis and characterization of WD. Radiocopper uptake studies have fallen out of favor, but a new stable isotope approach shows promise. Treatment focuses on limiting copper accumulation with penicillamine. Zinc acetate or trientine offer alternatives if penicillamine is not tolerated. Despite the fact that untreated WM is inevitably fatal, once diagnosed, the prognosis is generally good, and this is what raises high clinical suspicion in cases of unexplained liver or neurological disease in children or adults under 45 years of age requires age.",,"Chaloner, C.",2006,,,0,0,

2126,Extrapyramidal symptoms in Wilson's disease are associated with olfactory dysfunction,"Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accumulation of copper, mainly in the liver and brain. Since copper accumulation in the brain leads to disturbances in basal ganglia function, neurological patients typically present with hypo- and hyperkinetic extrapyramidal symptoms, with Parkinson's being very common. Although there are numerous reports of olfactory deficits in primary neurodegenerative diseases, olfactory function in metabolic disorders with extrapyramidal features has not been studied. 24 patients with Wilson's disease took part in the study. All patients were treated pharmacologically. They included patients with liver disease alone (including mild enzyme elevation in asymptomatic individuals; n=11) and/or neurological symptoms (n=13) at the time of testing. 21 patients underwent both [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . The severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was assessed using a clinical score system ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). All patients underwent psychophysical testing with the 'Sniffin' Sticks', which included tests for odor threshold, discrimination and identification. The results of the present study showed that patients with Wilson's disease with neurological symptoms have significant olfactory dysfunction compared to patients with liver type. Individuals who are more neurologically affected also have a more pronounced olfactory deficit. Interestingly, there was no significant effect of long-term treatment with penicillamine on olfactory function. Olfactory function did not significantly correlate with the presence of MRI-visible lesions in the basal ganglia or with regional glucose metabolism measured by [18]FDG-PET. Taken together, these findings indicate that the underlying pathologic changes involving basal ganglia degeneration and neuronal loss associated with a marked increase in copper content in this brain region play a role in the olfactory deficit. © 2006 Movement Disorder Society.",,"Muelle, A.;Reuner, U.;Landis, B.;Kitzler, H.;Reichmann, H.;Hummel, T.",2006,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.20989,0,0,
2127,Clinical and genetic profile in Wilson's disease: A case report with family tree. [German],"Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that leads to accumulation of copper in many organs. The Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring is a typical symptom in Wilson patients. ATP7B, the gene product of the Wilson disease gene, is expressed in hepatocytes and plays a crucial role in copper transport and secretion. Mutations involving this gene, resulting in amino acid substitutions, decrease the ATPase enzyme's affinity for copper and prevent the transport of copper by hepatocytes into the bile duct. More than 200 mutations in the 21 coding exons of the ATP7B gene have been described, the most common mutation in Europe is His1069Gln (30-60% in European patients). Wilson's disease can present with a variety of clinical features, usually liver and neuropsychiatric disorders. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease (prevalence 1:30,000) is based on a combination of clinical and neurological symptoms (Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring, MRI), a multiparametric clinical-chemical panel (ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, serum copper) and molecular genetics Analysis of ATP7B gene mutations. Symptomatic patients are treated with the chelating agents D-penicillamine or trientine, often with zinc in a second phase. Lifelong therapy is required and offers a near-normal life expectancy. Here we report the long-term follow-up of a 30-year-old Wilson patient presenting with composite heterozygosity of His1069Gln-Asn1270Ser mutations in the ATP7B gene, as diagnosed by LightCycler real-time polymerase chain reaction and exon 18 DNA sequencing. Molecular family tree analysis over four generations revealed seven additional heterozygous mutation carriers. Treatment of the index patient with high doses of the chelating agent D-penicillamine (1500 mg/day) in combination with zinc (150 mg/day) was able to normalize the copper encephalopathy and show significantly reduced neurological symptoms. Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring was persistent. Wilson's disease should be considered in the presence of liver disease of unknown cause or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Current diagnostic panels (international scoring system) involving clinical chemistry and molecular genetics for screening and confirmation of Wilson's disease are discussed.",,"Noppen, C.;Aerne-Wyrsch, L.;Wyrschs, J.;Viollier, E.

2129,Wilson's disease: A patient who went undiagnosed for 18 years,"Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, is the most common inherited liver disease in Hong Kong. The diagnosis is based on the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, typical neurological symptoms and/or a low serum ceruloplasmin concentration (< 0.20 g/L). Early detection and treatment protect patients and their pre-symptomatic siblings from devastating organ damage. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of Wilson's disease can be overlooked if only established clinical and laboratory tests are used as diagnostic criteria. We report the diagnosis of the disorder using genetic analysis of ATP7B in a presymptomatic sibling who evaded diagnosis at family screening 18 years previously. The patient was 11 months old when family screening was performed after an older sister was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. The boy was considered unaffected based on laboratory results in the expected range: serum copper level, 4.6 mumol/L; serum ceruloplasmin level 0.16 g/l; and 24-hour urinary copper excretion, 0.14 mumol/day. A molecular analysis of ATP7B was performed; the two siblings were found to have the same composite heterozygous mutations (G943D and 2299delC). We recommend that molecular diagnosis be the only definitive means of diagnosing Wilson's disease in children less than 1 year old.",,"Mak, C. M.;Tam, S.;Fan, S. T.;Liu, C. L.;Lam, C.

2133,Wilson's disease: Cranial MRI observations and clinical correlation,"Introduction: Examination of MRI changes can be useful for the diagnosis, prognosis, and better understanding of the pathophysiology of Wilson disease (WD). Our aim was to describe and correlate brain MRI abnormalities with clinical features in WD. METHODS: MRI evaluation was performed in 100 patients (57 males, 43 females; mean age 19.3 +/- 8.9 years) using standard protocols. All but 18 patients were on decoppers. Their history, clinical manifestations and disease severity scores were noted. Results: The mean duration of illness and treatment was 8.3 +/- 10.8 years and 7.5 +/- 7.1 years, respectively. Brain MRI was abnormal in all 93 symptomatic patients. The most prominent observations were atrophy of the cerebrum (70%), brainstem (66%) and cerebellum (52%). Signaling abnormalities were also noted: putamen (72%), caudate (61%), thalami (58%), midbrain (49%), pons (20%), white matter (25%), cortex (9%), medulla ( 12%) and cerebellum (10%). The characteristic T2-W globus pallidal hypointensity (34%), the ""giant panda face"" sign (12%), the T1-W striatal hyperintensity (6%), the central pontine myelinosis (7%) and the bright claustral sign (4%) were also detected. MRI changes correlated with disease severity (P<0.001) but did not correlate with disease duration. Conclusion: MRI changes were universal but diverse, affecting almost all structures of the brain in symptomatic patients. A fair correlation between MRI observations and various clinical features provides an explanation for the multifaceted manifestations of the disease. © Springer Verlag 2006.",,"Sinha, S.;Taly, A.

2135,Effect of D-penicillamine on rat lung elastin crosslinking during the perinatal period,"This study was designed to clarify the effects of D-penicillamine (DPA), a drug used to treat various pathological events, on neonatal lung elastin formation and maturation in the perinatal period. The study was conducted on 20 newborn rats bred from 40 female and six male rats. DPA doses of 400 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> and physiological saline were administered intraperitoneally (ip) to experimental and control groups. In order to assess the maturation of the newborns, their body and lung weights were determined. Serum Cu levels were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy and ceruloplasmin (Cp) activities were measured spectrophotometrically. Elastin, desmosine (DES) and isodesmosine (IDES) levels in newborn lung tissue were measured by HPLC. Results showed that DPA treatment resulted in loss of skin elasticity and reduction in body and lung weight in newborns in the experimental group. It was found that serum Cu levels and Cp activity were significantly lower in both maternal and neonates of the experimental groups compared to the control group. The lung DES, IDES and elastin values of the newborns in the experimental group were reduced compared to the control group. Taken together, our results indicate that 400 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> DPA, a dose used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and cystinuria, the delay in maturation of the newborn, a decrease in DES-IDES cross-links and in lung elastin levels of the offspring in the perinatal period. Another conclusion that can be drawn from this study is that even mild Cu deficiency due to DPA administration induces a change in cross-linking in lung elastin during the perinatal period.

2137,Importance of molecular genetic testing for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. [Czech],"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper (Cu) transport with a frequency of 1/40,000 in live births. The disease is caused by a deficiency of the copper-transporting ATPase - ATP7B (13q14.3-q21.1). The disorder manifests as chronic liver disease and/or neurological impairment due to accumulation of copper in multiple tissues, primarily the liver and brain. The most common manifestation of WM is between 8 and 20 years of age. Diagnostics include serum ceruloplasmin and Cu detection, Cu detection in 24-hour urine, performance of a test with penicillamine, liver biopsy, determination of the Cu content in liver dry weight and DNA diagnostics, if available. The interpretation of biochemical findings changes due to DNA analysis of mutations. So far there is no exact correlation between genotype and phenotype of the patient. The therapy of the disease is developing and is currently accepted for the liver from childhood onwards as standard therapy with chelates and zinc. In the final stages, the solution would be a liver transplant. The group included 22 children aged 5 to 17 years. Group 1 (12) consisted of heterozygotes for MM, siblings or offspring of patients with MM confirmed by DNA diagnosis. The 2nd group (10) were patients with hepatic form of WD, confirmed by DNA diagnosis and determination of hepatic dry weight copper content. The control group consisted of 11 children aged 4 to 16 years. In 4 subjects of the 1st group, i.e. 33.3%, the authors found that the level of ceruloplasmin in the blood had fallen below 0.2 g/l (range between 0.12 and 0.43 g/l) . They demonstrated a statistically significant difference (P<0.05) for serum CP among heterozygotes for WD; ie, among the offspring of mothers with WM and siblings of subjects with WM. Copper threshold values were determined in the basic urine of 4 children (ie 0.6 µmol). The copper content in the 24-hour urine collected from 11 heterozygotes tested with penicillamine did not exceed 12.5 µmol. In 7 children of the 2nd group, the authors showed a serum level of ceruloplasmin of less than 0.2 g/l, ie 70% (between 0.03 and 0.22 g/l). All 24-hour copper urine samples contained elevated residues of more than 0.6 mumol (between 0.8 and 2.67 mumol). Contrary to expectations, values above 1.6 µmol were found in only 4 children. A statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) in the 24-hour urinary copper excretion was found between the control group of healthy children and subjects with WM, even by the sex of the subjects studied. In the test with penicillamine, the Cu residue in the urine of 8 subjects was less than 20 µmol (given as the extreme value for WD). Copper excretion in the urine after administration of penicillamine does not contribute to the differentiation of heterozygotes from patients with MV. An important screening method is the determination of the copper content in the liver dry weight. However, the authors assume that the interpretation of these findings will change in the near future with regard to DNA mutation diagnostics. According to these results, studies of the Kayser-Fleischer ring are not very important in early childhood forms of the liver. In a subject with the IVS12+1G>A/G1355C genotype, they found that the more severe the form of the mutation detected in a WM patient, the more severe the expected clinical course of the disease. Serious mutations in the heterozygotes can mimic WD. The authors recorded an attack of anxiety disorders in a girl with genotype H1069Q/W779X. In children with the allele H1069Q, they showed minimal brain damage, graphomotor inability and slightly abnormal EEG in the basal activity with no clinical correlation.",,"Prochazkova, D.;Konecna, P.;Vrabelova, S.;Kozak, L.;Dastych, M.;Hrstkova, H.",2005,,,0,0,

2139,Wilson's disease in children: 37 years of experience and revised King's for liver transplantation,"Wilson disease (WD) is a rare liver-based disorder of copper metabolism. Prognostic criteria, described by our group in 1986 to predict death without transplantation, have not been universally validated. The clinical characteristics of 88 children were reviewed, retrospectively in 74 and prospectively in 14. Data from retrospectively recruited patients who died or survived on long-term chelation therapy were used to assess the validity of our old scoring system and to develop a new prognostic index , then evaluated in the 14 prospectively recruited patients. Using the old scoring system, 5 children with a score >= 7, the cutoff for death without transplantation, survived, while 4 children with a score <= 7 died (sensitivity 87% and specificity 90%). A new index based on serum bilirubin, international normalized ratio, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and white blood cell count (WCC) at presentation identified a cutoff score of 11 for death and was found to be 93% sensitive and 98% specific with a positive predictive value result of 88%. When evaluated prospectively in 14 patients, the new index predicted the need for transplantation in only the 4 patients who required transplantation, although 1 child with a score of 11 survived medical treatment. In conclusion, the new Wilson index is more sensitive and specific in predicting non-transplant mortality than the old scoring system, but it needs to be validated in a larger number of patients.

2145,Liver transplantation for Wilson's disease: The burden of neurological and psychiatric disorders,"retrospective analysis of data on liver transplantation in Wilson's disease (WD) was performed in Italian liver transplantation centers. 37 cases were identified. The main indication for liver transplantation was chronic advanced liver disease in 78% of patients. Mixed hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms were noted in 32.3%. Eight patients presented with fulminant liver failure; 44.8% were receiving medical treatment. Patient and graft survival at 3 months, 12 months, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years after transplantation was 91.8%, 89.1%, 82.9%, 75.6% and 58.8%, respectively and 85.3%, 83.0%, 77.1%, 70.3% and 47.2%. Neurological symptoms improved significantly after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), but survival of patients with mixed hepatic and neuropsychiatric involvement was significantly lower than that of patients with liver disease alone (p=0.04). WD, characterized by liver involvement alone, is a rare but good indication for liver transplantation when specific medical therapy fails. Patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms have a significantly shorter survival time, although liver transplantation has a positive impact on neurological symptoms. In conclusion, a combination of hepatic and neuropsychiatric diseases deserves careful neurological evaluation, which should contraindicate OLT in case of severe neurological impairment.

2148,Role of animal models in studying drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions,"Drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) are a major problem, in large part because of their unpredictable nature. If we better understood the mechanisms of these reactions, they could be predictable. Their unpredictable nature also makes mechanistic studies very difficult, especially prospective clinical studies. Animal models are crucial for most biomedical research, and they are almost the only way to test fundamental hypotheses of DHRs, such as B. the involvement of reactive metabolites. However, useful animal models of DHRs are rare because DHRs are also unpredictable in animals. For example. However, sulfonamide-induced DHRs in large breed dogs appear to be valid as they closely resemble the DHRs found in humans. the incidence is only ~0.25% and large breed dogs are difficult to use as an animal model. Two other practical models are penicillamine-induced autoimmunity in the Brown Norway rat and nevirapine-induced rash in rats. Toxicity in these models is clearly immune-mediated. In other models, such as amodiaquine-induced agranulocytosis/hepatotoxicity and halothane-induced hepatotoxicity, the drug induces an immune response but there is no clinical toxicity. This finding suggests that regulatory mechanisms normally limit toxicity. Many of the fundamental properties of the penicillamine and nevirapine models, such as B. memory and tolerance, are quite different, suggesting that the mechanisms are also significantly different. More animal models are needed to explore the range of mechanisms involved in DHRs; without them, understanding of such reactions is likely to be slow. Copyright ©2003.

2149,"Essentiality, toxicology and chelation of zinc and copper","Both zinc and copper are essential minerals needed for various cellular functions. Although these metals are essential, they can be toxic in excessive amounts, particularly in certain genetic disorders. Zinc and copper homeostasis results from coordinated regulation by various proteins involved in the uptake, excretion, and intracellular storage/transport of these metals. In addition to families of the zinc transporter (ZnT) and the Cu-ATPase, metallothionein is an important storage protein for zinc and copper. Metallothioneins are intracellular polypeptides with a remarkable ability to bind metal ions. These proteins bind both essential metals, which are indispensable for the organism, and toxic metals (e.g. cadmium or lead). Metallothioneins play a crucial role in maintaining zinc and copper homeostasis. In this review, we summarize the toxicity of zinc and copper and the potential treatment of zinc or copper toxicity by zinc or copper specific chelating agents and the strategy to upregulate metallothionein. © 2005 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",,"Cai, L.;Li, X.

2150,Hepatic Wilson disease: initial treatment and long-term management,"This article is based on the experience of 320 patients with Wilson's disease treated between 1954 and 2000. These patients were treated at the Boston City Hospital from 1954 to 1955 and at the University College Hospital in London from 1955 to 1957; Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1967 to 1987, and The Middlesex Hospital London, 1988 to 2000. Strictly speaking, Wilson's disease is not a gastroenterological disease but a genetic metabolic disease mediated by a deficiency in the excretion of copper in the bile. The mutation on chromosome 13q14.3: It is a copper-bearing ATPase (ATPase 7B); more than 250 mutations are now known. The first organ affected is the liver, then many other tissues, mainly the brain but also the eyes, kidneys, bone marrow and skeletal system. This article is about the hepatic form of the disease. Liver disease can be acute, subacute, or chronic; it can be progressive or apparently self-limiting. Hemolysis is also found in 10% of patients, which can later lead to the formation of pigment gallstones. The management of liver disease is not considered in this article, which is strictly limited to the available therapeutic options for copper elimination and the patient's long-term well-being. It must be remembered that all close relatives of the patient must be screened for the pre-symptomatic stage of the disease so that, if they are homozygous carriers of the mutation, preventive treatment can be started.

Estimation of the amounts of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) by comet assay showed that SSBs were induced by DNA in a sizeable population of LEC rat renal cortical cells around 12 weeks of age and that the amounts of SSBs increased in an age-dependent manner aged 12 to 18 weeks. When LEC rats were treated with trientine from 10 weeks of age, the observed number of cells with DNA damage decreased, suggesting that induction of SSBs was inhibited by DNA and/or SSBs were repaired during the trientine treatment period . The results show that DNA SSBs are induced in kidney cells of LEC rats before clinical signs of liver damage appear and that treatment of LEC rats with trientine reduces the number of DNA strand breaks.

2152,Homozygosity for a gross partial gene deletion of the C-terminal end of ATP7B in a Wilson's patient with hepatic and no neurological manifestations,"We identified a partial gene deletion of ATP7B in a patient with liver-onset Wilson's disease. The deletion encompassed exon 20, including much of the flanking intron. The breakpoints were identified and the size of the deletion was determined to be 2144 bp. The deletion is predicted to result in a mutant protein product containing 45 different amino acids after transmembrane domain 7 and lacking transmembrane domain 8 and the entire C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. This is the first time that a partial gene deletion has been detected in ATP7B. The patient presented at age 10 with hepatic manifestations including severe jaundice, hepato-splenomegaly, ascites, and spider nevi. Liver biopsy showed fibrosis and early signs of cirrhosis. There was a Kayser-Fleischer ring but no neurological manifestations. All symptoms disappeared under penicillamine therapy. This suggests that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of ATP7B is not essential for its neurological function. Large deletions in ATP7B may be an overlooked cause of Wilson's disease. Patients homozygous for deletions can be valuable in understanding the function of different regions of the ATP7B protein. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Moller, L.

2153,Mowat-Wilson Syndrome and Zinc Finger Homeo Box 1B Gene Mutation: A New Syndrome Probably Underdiagnosed,"Goals. The aim of this study is to raise awareness of a likely underdiagnosed syndrome. Clinical recognition of the syndrome in infants and children with and without HSCR is important for selecting patients for cytogenetic and molecular analyses. methods. The clinical characteristics of four Italian patients are reported. FISH and mutation analyzes were performed. Assessment of psychomotor development was performed using the Denver Developmental Screening Test II (DDTS II). Results. All four patients had mutations in the ZFHX1B gene; Patients 1, 3 and 4 showed novel mutations that have never been described before. The clinical features of our patients were compared to those in the literature. The most common malformations were HSCR (62.8%), congenital heart disease (50.7%), agenesis of the corpus callosum (45.6%). Hypospadias was present in 46.2% of patients. Seizures were very common (75.0%). Conclusions. Like classic genetic syndromes, Mowat-Wilson syndrome is easily recognizable by the pronounced facial phenotype, the associated malformations, seizures, microcephaly and severe intellectual disability. Confirmation of the diagnosis by the presence of mutations in the ZFHX1B gene is important for genetic counseling since all patients reported to date have been sporadic findings, although the possibility of gonadal mosaicism cannot be ruled out.",,"Cerruti Mainardi, P.;Garavelli, L.;Pastore, G.;Virdis, R.;Pedori, S.;Godi, M.;Provera, S.;Rauch, A.;Zweier, C.;Castronovo, C.;Zollino, M.;Banchini, G.;Bernasconi, S.;Neri, G.",2005,April,,0,0,
2154,EMG and motor evoked potentials in patients with Wilson's disease,"We studied four patients with Wilson's disease (WD), mean age 37.5 years; and if the disease lasted between 2 and 6 years. Diagnosis was based on evaluation of copper metabolism with significant copper levels in 24-hour urine, neurological status, CT of the head, liver involvement, and the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring. All patients underwent a complex EMG study: blink reflex (BR), cranial and spinal motor magnetic evoked potentials (MEPs) and limb nerve conduction velocities (NCVs). The first 3 patients (2 females and 1 male) were evaluated before starting d-penicillamine therapy and the last patient, a 25-year-old female with 12-year history of WD, after 2 years of cuprenil treatment. All patients had normal NCVs and spinal MEPs. BR and cranial MEPs were abnormal in 3 untreated patients. The patient on maintenance treatment showed near-normal parameters, apart from reduced amplitudes of cranial MEPs. Although our results are preliminary and insufficient for reliable conclusion and statistical analysis, they suggest that by applying specific electrophysiological methods, we could determine clinically latent dysfunctions of the central motor neuron, pyramidal tracts, and brainstem in WM. There is evidence that some parameters of these tests could be useful in addition to monitoring treatment.",,"Klissurski, M. G.;Muradyan, N.;Novachkova, S.;Vassileva, E.;Ishpekova, B.",2005,,,0,0,
2155,Risk and benefit of drug use during pregnancy,"Environmental teratogenic factors (e.g. alcohol) are avoidable. We focus our analysis on human teratogenic drugs that are not commonly used during pregnancy. The previous human teratogenic studies had serious methodological problems, eg the concept of the first trimester is outdated because environmental teratogens cannot induce congenital abnormalities in the first month of pregnancy. In addition, teratogens usually cause specific congenital anomalies or syndromes. Finally, the importance of chemical structures, routes of administration and reasons for treatment have not been taken into account in the evaluation of drugs. On the other hand, in the so-called epidemiological case-control studies, the general memory bias was not limited. These biases explain that the teratogenic risk of drugs is exaggerated while the benefits of drug use during pregnancy are underestimated. Therefore, a better balance between risk and benefit of drug treatment during pregnancy is needed. Of course, we must do our best to reduce the risk of teratogenic drugs as much as possible, but it is worth emphasizing the preventive effect of drugs for congenital anomalies associated with maternal diseases (eg, diabetes mellitus and hyperthermia).

2156,Zinc supplementation decreases hepatic copper accumulation in LEC rats: A model of Wilson's disease,"The effect of dietary zinc (Zn) supplementation on copper (Cu)-induced liver damage was studied in Long Evans cinnamon rats (LEC), a model of Wilson's disease (WD). Four-week-old LEC (N=64) and control Long Evans (LE) (N=32) female rats were divided into two groups; one group was fed a Zn-supplemented diet (Group I) and the other received a normal rodent diet (Group II). LEC rats were sacrificed at 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 and 20 weeks of age; LE control rats were sacrificed at 6, 12, 18 and 20 weeks of age. Liver Cu concentration was reduced in LEC rats fed Zn-supplemented chow compared to normal-fed LEC rats between 6 and 18 weeks of age. The metallothionein (MT) concentration in the liver of group I LEC rats increased between 12 and 20 weeks of age, while the hepatic MT concentration in group II LEC rats decreased after 12 weeks. Hepatocyte apoptosis, as determined by TUNEL, was reduced in Zn-supplemented LEC rats at any age. Cholangiocellular carcinoma was observed only in LEC rats in group II at week 20. These results suggest that Zn supplementation can decrease hepatic Cu concentration and delay the onset of clinical and pathological changes in Cu toxicity in LEC rats. Although the actual protective mechanism is unknown, it could be explained by sequestration of dietary Cu by intestinal MT induced by high dietary Zn content. © Copyright 2005 by Humana Press Inc.",,"Esparza Gonzalez, B.

2157,Genetic disorders of copper transport - diagnosis and new treatment for patients with Wilson's disease -. [Japanese],"Wilson's disease and Menkes' disease are inherited genetic disorders of copper metabolism. Each disease results from the absence or dysfunction of homologous copper-transporting ATPases present in the trans-Golgi network of cells. Wilson's ATPase transports copper into the hepatocyte secretory pathway, where it is incorporated into ceruloplasmin and excreted in the bile. Therefore, patients with autosomal recessive Wilson's disease present with signs and symptoms that result from impaired biliary copper excretion. Menkes ATPase transports copper across the placenta, gastrointestinal tract and blood-brain barrier, and the clinical features of this X-linked disease arise from copper deficiency. Despite striking differences in the clinical presentation of these two diseases, the respective ATPases function in exactly the same way inside the cell. The different clinical features of each disease are the result of the tissue-specific expression of these ATPases. In Wilson's disease, impaired biliary copper excretion leads to accumulation of this metal in the liver. When the storage capacity of the liver is exceeded, cell death occurs, releasing copper into the plasma, leading to hemolysis and deposition of copper in extrahepatic tissues. Affected patients usually present in the first or second decade of life with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis or acute liver failure. Copper accumulation in the cornea leads to Kayser-Fleischer rings. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are more common in adults and include dystonia, tremor, personality changes, and cognitive impairment as a result of copper accumulation in the basal ganglia and other brain regions. The diagnosis of Wilson disease is confirmed by decreased serum ceruloplasmin, increased urinary copper, and increased hepatic copper. A large number of different mutations occur in the genes of patients with Wilson's disease. Copper chelation drugs and zinc are effective in most cases. New treatment guidelines are now advising doctors to start patients on zinc.",,"Aoki, T.",2005,,,0,0,

Huntington's disease has received the most clinical and scientific attention, in part due to the availability of accurate genetic testing, but commercial genetic testing is available for several other conditions, including SCAs. Genetic testing is helpful for some trinucleotide repeat disorders, but the impact of testing on the patient and family should be evaluated. Basal ganglia degeneration is seen in several of these disorders and may account for some of the behavioral changes, particularly deficits in impulse control, motivation, and executive function, along with motor symptoms. Because many of the conditions discussed may be associated with similar motor and behavioral symptoms, a careful family history, examination, and selected laboratory tests may be required if the diagnosis is questioned. Psychiatric symptoms are common with these disorders and can result in disability comparable to the movement disorder itself. There is little research into treating psychiatric disorders in these disorders, but standard therapies can be useful and should be tried when needed.",,"Anderson, K.

2163,Wilson's disease: High prevalence in a mountain area of Crete,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The disorder is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase. The worldwide incidence is of the order of 30 cases per million, with a gene frequency of 0.56% and a carrier frequency of 1 in 90. The increased number of patients with Wilson's disease on the island of Crete prompted us to examine the spectrum of mutations in to are investigating a small village near the city of Heraklion, from where many patients have been referred over the past 25 years. To estimate the incidence of the disease, we first examined the number of births and the number of WM patients in the village since 1978. Six out of 90 births were diagnosed as WM patients, representing the highest prevalence of WM reported to date. Analysis of the entire gene in three patients with Wilson's disease and relatives of a boy who died of WD revealed 4 different point mutations. Two of them were missense (p.I1148T and p.G1176R) and cosegregated in cis in the same patient; the other allele of this patient carried a nonsense mutation (p.Q289X). This is the first report in the literature of three co-segregating mutations in the same WM patient. The fourth mutation identified was a novel frameshift mutation (c.398delT) with documented cosegregation. When 200 residents from the same area were screened, 18 were identified as carrying one of these mutations. These results point to the need for health education, genetic counseling and newborn screening for Wilson disease. © University College London 2005.",,"Dedoussis, G. V. Z.;Genschel, J.;Sialvera, T.

2164,The role of copper in tumor angiogenesis,"Copper stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and migration and is required for the secretion of several angiogenic factors by tumor cells. Copper chelate decreases the secretion of many of these factors. Serum copper levels are upregulated in many human tumors and correlate with tumor burden and prognosis. Copper chelators reduce tumor growth and microvascular density in animal models. New orally active copper chelators have enabled clinical trials to be conducted, and several trials are ongoing.

2167,"Copper, oxidative stress and human health","Copper (Cu), a redox-active metal, is an essential nutrient for all species studied to date. Over the last decade there has been increasing interest in the concept that marginal deficiencies in this element can contribute to the development and progression of a range of disease states, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. A deficiency in this nutrient during pregnancy can lead to gross structural abnormalities at conception and persistent neurological and immunological abnormalities in the offspring. Excessive amounts of Cu in the body can also pose a risk. Acute Cu toxicity can lead to a variety of pathologies and in severe cases, death. Chronic Cu toxicity can lead to liver disease and severe neurological defects. The concept that elevated ceruloplasmin is a risk factor for certain diseases is debated. In this article we will review the current literature on the possible causes of Cu deficiency and Cu toxicity and the associated pathological consequences. Finally, we will examine some of the potential biochemical lesions that could underlie these pathologies. Since oxidative stress is a hallmark of Cu deficiency, special attention is paid to the role of Cu in the oxidative defense system.

Astrocytes were Alzheimer's types 1 and 2; and type 1 were labeled by anti-metallothionein. Opalski cells were abundant and their macrophage lineage was confirmed by immunostaining. Among the proposed possible mechanisms, the role of vascular factors and penicillamine treatment could be excluded.

The effect of oral zinc (Zn) acetate treatment on the development of acute hepatitis and the biochemical parameters of Cu-induced liver damage was investigated in 5-week-old LEC rats (n = 52). METHODS: Rats receiving 50 or 80 mg/mL/day Zn acetate by gavage and control rats receiving a daily dose of 0.02 g/mL glucose solution by gastric intubation were treated 1, 2, or 8 weeks after the start of treatment killed. Results: Treatment with Zn acetate led to the prevention of acute hepatitis: 10 of the 13 untreated rats developed signs and symptoms compatible with acute hepatitis between weeks 6 and 7 of treatment. Tissue metallothionein (MT) increased significantly in the treated rats and correlated positively with hepatic Zn concentrations. Control rats had significantly higher liver and kidney iron concentrations compared to supplemented rats, both after short-term and long-term experiments. 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels were significantly lower in untreated rats. Conclusions: Zn acetate prevents acute hepatitis by increasing tissue MT concentrations, reducing Cu absorption and interfering with Fe metabolism. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.",,"Medici, V.;Sturniolo, G.

2175,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc from the time of diagnosis in pediatric patients: A 10-year follow-up study at a single hospital,"Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism characterized by hepatic failure to clear copper, leading to accumulation in the liver, brain, cornea, and kidney, leading to chronic degenerative changes. It is generally accepted that ""pre-symptomatic"" patients - who are diagnosed with childhood WM and are defined as those who, while still asymptomatic, have liver disease, as indicated by elevated serum levels of transaminases - should be treated prophylactically. Here we report our results in 22 children treated with continuous oral zinc therapy for 10 years. Zinc sulfate was administered at a dosage of 25 mg elemental zinc twice daily until age 6, 25 mg three times daily between ages 7 and 16 or until the child reached body weight 125 lb and 50 mg, three times daily thereafter . Five years after starting zinc treatment, we found a highly significant decrease in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and urinary copper excretion, but white blood cell counts did not fluctuate significantly. Six of 22 patients had persistent ALT levels greater than normal and only 1 patient had ALT levels greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. A further decrease in urinary ALT, AST, and copper excretion was observed at the end of the 10-year follow-up, but these decreases were not statistically significant. Only 1 patient continued to have abnormal ALT levels. Again, the white blood cells showed no significant variations. All histological scores (steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis) were significantly reduced after treatment. Hepatic copper levels were also significantly reduced, although they remained higher than normal in all patients. Removal of toxic copper was confirmed by the disappearance of Kayser-Fleischer rings in 3 patients. Zinc had no negative effects on growth. The effectiveness of zinc in WD in pre-symptomatic pediatric patients has been demonstrated in previous studies and our study adds significantly to the previous results as it includes a large number of very young children, up to 11 under 6 years and 20 under 10 years The excellent clinical results in all patients, coupled with the improvement in hepatic histological findings in the vast majority, provide convincing evidence that zinc treatment can effectively and safely control the disease and prevent its progression over a 10-year period. Histological findings were reported to improve in 3 patients treated in a previous study, but our data are much more relevant numerically. In particular, histological examination of the liver revealed that the concentration of copper was reduced by the treatment, suggesting that oral zinc could not only prevent further accumulation of copper, but also promote at least some depletion of its stores. The absence of adverse effects of zinc on growth suggests that our patients received adequate anti-copper therapy to prevent damage from copper toxicity, but adequate amounts of copper for adequate growth and development. Taken together, our results indicate that zinc is the treatment of choice in presymptomatic pediatric patients with WM. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

2182,Wilson's Disease: Clinical Management and Therapy,"This review focuses on the treatment and management of patients with Wilson's disease. A key feature of management is the selection of anticopper drugs or drugs for different disease states and classes. Physicians should no longer rely on penicillamine as the primary choice for treating this disease. In fact, our recommendation is to use penicillamine infrequently. For initial treatment of liver failure, we recommend a combination of trientine and zinc. For initial treatment of the neurological/psychiatric symptoms, we recommend tetrathiomolybdate and zinc. If tetrathiomolybdate is not available, zinc alone is our second choice. For maintenance therapy (usually 2 to 4 months after initial therapy), for pre-symptomatic patients, and for pregnant patients, zinc is recommended along with trientine as a second choice.

2184,Wilson's Disease: Clinical Presentations. [French],"Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder that is recessively autosomal transmitted and involves a disorder of copper metabolism. The prevalence is 1/30,000. It is treatable but can be fatal if not treated early and treated appropriately. The cause is the loss of function of an adenosine triphosphatase (ATP 7B), which is due to a mutation in the ATP 7B gene on chromosome 13. This leads to reduced or absent copper transport to the bile and its accumulation over time in organs, especially the liver and brain. In this article we present two cases of Wilson's disease in two young male patients. We also briefly review the pathophysiology of the disease, discuss the latest guidelines for diagnosis and treatment, and outline recent genetic discoveries.",,"Chilcott-Lauber, C.;Burkhard, P.

We report on a 35-year-old woman with a history of hepatic dysfunction who developed major depression several years later and eventually presented with symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The underlying diagnosis is WM and family screening revealed WM in 2 other siblings. Because of fever and leukopenia, she could not tolerate penicillamine. While taking trientine hydrochloride and zinc sulfate, her parkinsonism improved and her depression remained in remission.

A significant number of these positive designations have already matured into full marketing authorisations. Three main reasons - failure to meet prevalence or significant benefit criteria or demonstration of biological plausibility - all contributed equally to the remaining applications being either rejected or withdrawn by the applicants. In July 2004, the European Commission published a Communication setting out its position on certain issues related to the implementation of the designation and market exclusivity provisions. The Commission, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) remain proactive and offer as much guidance and incentives as possible by engaging with sponsors, patient groups and the scientific community.

2188,Serum transaminases in children with Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVES: The response of serum transaminase levels to treatment with penicillamine and zinc in Wilson's disease is poorly understood. The aim of this multicenter retrospective study was to evaluate transaminase levels after penicillamine and zinc treatment in children with Wilson's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and nine patients with Wilson's disease (mean age at diagnosis 7.2 years; range 1 to 18 years) treated for at least 12 months and followed for the past 20 years in 11 pediatric departments were studied. Clinical, laboratory, and histological features at diagnosis and initial treatment were recorded. Efficacy parameters were normalization of serum transaminase levels and improved clinical and/or laboratory values. 102 patients had clinical or laboratory signs of liver disease. RESULTS: Fifty-six of 87 patients (64%) given penicillamine normalized serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels within a median of 17 months (range: 2 to 96 months). Of the 29 patients with persistent hyper-ALT, 17 (59%) crossed over to zinc; only four of these normalized ALT to zinc within a median of 38 months (range 7 to 48 months). Eleven (50%) of the 22 patients given zinc alone normalized ALT within a median of 6 months (range 1 to 36 months). Of the 11 patients with persistent hyper-ALT, five crossed over to penicillamine. Three of the five normalized ALT within a median of 6 months (range 6 to 9 months). Overall, in patients with persistent hypertransaminasemia treated with penicillamine and zinc, ALT decreased from a basal median of 236 IU/L (range 54 to 640 IU/L) to a median of 78 (range 46 to 960 IU/L) at the end of follow-up (P=0.0245). Poor compliance was suspected in only 10% of cases. No predictive factor for sustained hypertransaminasemia has been identified. Liver disease did not worsen in any patient during the study.

[Chinese],"AIM: To observe the effects of high-concentration Zn intake on zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), lipid metabolism and antioxidant function in humans to provide a scientific basis for Zn supplementation. METHODS: 40 healthy rural men were selected and taken tablets containing 50 mg Zn (as 0.2 g zinc glucose) daily for eight weeks. All subjects were examined five times: at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8 during the period of Zn supplementation and at week 12, and their serum, red blood cells, hair and 24-hour urine were collected simultaneously for testing. RESULTS: (1) Zn levels in serum, erythrocytes and hair increased significantly after 2 to 4 weeks of supplementation and decreased 4 weeks after supplementation stopped, but was still higher than before supplementation. 24-hour urine Zn levels increased significantly after supplementation and decreased to the same level as before supplementation 4 weeks after supplementation was stopped. (2) Cu levels in serum, erythrocytes and hair increased significantly after 4 weeks of supplementation and decreased 4 weeks after supplementation was stopped. The Cu content in the 24-hour urine did not change significantly during the test. (3) RBC superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were persistently decreased after 2 weeks of supplementation and were not recovered 4 weeks after supplementation was stopped. RBC glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities increased significantly after 4 weeks of supplementation. Lipid peroxide (LPO) levels increased significantly after 2 weeks of supplementation. (4) Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100) increased significantly, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HLD-C) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) decreased after supplementation.

2196,Wilson's disease and its pharmacological treatment. [Japanese],"Wilson disease is an inherited copper toxicosis caused by a defective putative copper transport of ATPase in the liver. Due to impaired bile secretion, copper remains in the liver, leading to chronic liver lesions including fatty changes, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. In the latter stage, extrapyramidal syndromes can develop with and without symptomatic liver lesions. Acute liver damage associated with hemolysis and deep jaundice may be the first manifestation. The majority of patients present with hypoceruloplasminemia, which has been used as a screening test for the disease. A large number of mutations in the ATP7B gene have been reported. Therefore, when mutations are identified in an index patient, genetic diagnosis could be used limited to the presymptomatic diagnosis of siblings. The introduction of penicillamine caused a revolution in the treatment of patients. Another chelating agent, trientine, is now available for those who cannot tolerate penicillamine. Tetrathiomolibdate and zinc acetate are other alternatives currently being tested. Hypoceruloplasminemia and further reduction after chelation therapy may be associated with iron overload. This complication is closely related to impaired transport of ferrous ions due to ferroxidase deficiency. Non-compliance and teratogenicity are other important concerns as any treatment with the agents listed above is a lifelong regimen. Despite various side effects of penicillamine, its teratogenicity is negligible. These data indicate that penicillamine is the drug of first choice for this disease. © 2004 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",,"Hayashi, H.;Suzuki, R.;Wakusawa, S.",2004,November,http://dx.doi.org/10.1248/yakushi.124.711,0,0,

2200,Treatment of Wilson's disease with penicillamine and zinc salts: a follow-up study. [Chinese],"OBJECTIVE: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive accumulation of copper in the liver and later in the brain and other organs. Penicillamine acts as a reductive chelator. Zinc salts induce the synthesis of metallothionein in cells. Thus, theoretically, these two drugs are synergistic for the treatment of the disease. However, the two drugs can also have some unfavorable interactions. In this study, the effect of combined penicillamine and zinc salt therapy was evaluated in the follow-up observations of 21 patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: Use of combined therapy of penicillamine [10-30 mg/(kg.d)] and zinc (22.5 mg, 3 times a day), follow-up study by hospitalization or communication by telephone or mail. RESULTS: Before treatment, all 21 patients had chronic liver disease. Among them, 13 patients (62%) showed a response to treatment for their liver disease, 5 patients (24%) died, and 3 patients (14%) discontinued our follow-up study. Of the 5 patients who died, 3 died within 40 days of treatment, one had taken only 8 mg/(kg.d) penicillamine and one died after parental discontinuation of treatment. Of the 12 patients with neurological involvement, neurological symptoms resolved or markedly improved in 11 patients after treatment. One patient discontinued the follow-up study. The patient with renal tubular acidosis responded well to treatment. Routine urinalysis was performed in 6 of the 7 patients with hematuria. The hematuria resolved in one patient, became less severe in one patient, and remained unchanged in four patients. One patient was found to be hypersensitive to penicillamine. WBC and platelets were further reduced in 3 patients after medication. CONCLUSIONS: The combined therapy with penicillamine and zinc salts was effective in the treatment of patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Li, M.;Zhang, Y. H.;Qin, J.",2003,Feb,,0,0,
2201,What have we learned from cDNA microarray gene expression studies about the role of iron in MPTP-induced neurodegeneration and Parkinson's disease?,"There have been numerous hypotheses regarding the etiology and mechanism of dopaminergic neurodegeneration of the dorsal raphe in Parkinson's disease and its animal models, MPTP (N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and 6-hydroxydopamine. The advent of cDNA microarray gene expression, where the expression of thousands of genes can be assessed globally, has shown that the mechanism of neurodegeneration by MPTP is a complex cascade of vicious circles. One of these is altering genes associated with iron metabolism, a transition metal that is closely linked to the induction of reactive oxygen species formation and the induction of oxidative stress. cDNA gene expression analyzes support the established hypothesis of an oxidatively induced neurodegeneration with iron deposition in the brain of Parkinson's patients of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPC). The regulation of cellular iron metabolism has been further enhanced by the recent discovery of two iron-regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, which control cellular iron levels. When cellular iron levels increase, IRP2 is depleted through ubiquitination and no further iron accumulates. The opposite occurs when cellular iron levels are low. Knock-out IRP1 and IRP2 mice have shown that in the latter mice, brain iron accumulation precedes the neurodegeneration, ataxia, and bradykinesia observed in these animals. In fact, MPTP treatment, which leads to iron accumulation in SNCP, abolishes IRP2 with the concomitant increase in alpha-synuclein. Iron chelators such as R-apomorphine and EGCG, which protect against MPTP neurotoxicity, prevent the loss of IRP2 and the increase in alpha-synuclein. The presence of iron along with alpha-synuclein in SNPC can be detrimental to dopaminergic neurons. Iron has since been shown to cause alpha-synuclein aggregation into a neurotoxic agent. The use of iron chelators that penetrate the blood-brain barrier as neuroprotective drugs has been envisaged.",,"Youdim, M. B. H.",2003,,,0,0,

It is involved in the modulation of pain and cognition. High blood levels have been reported in patients with acute and chronic pain and in Wilson's disease. A fortuitous observation prompted us to investigate nociceptin in hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Plasma nociceptin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay, aprotinin was used as a protease inhibitor. Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed by laboratory, ultrasonography, and other imaging techniques and confirmed by fine-needle biopsy. The results were compared to healthy controls and patients with other chronic liver diseases. RESULTS: Although nociceptin levels in patients with Wilson disease (14.0 +/- 2.7 pg/mL, n = 26), primary biliary cirrhosis (12.1 +/- 3.2 pg/mL, 17 = 21) and liver cirrhosis (12.8+/-4.0 pg/mL, n=15) compared to the healthy controls (9.2+/-1.8 pg/mL, n=29, P<0.001 for each) a ten-fold increase was found in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (105.9 +/- 14.4 pg/mL, n=29, P<0.0001). High plasma levels were found in every patient with hepatocellular carcinoma, including those with normal alpha-fetoprotein and those with pain (104.9 +/- 14.9 pg/mL, n = 12) and without (107.7 +/- 14 .5 pg/ml, n=6) . Conclusion: A very high nociceptin plasma level seems to be an indicator for hepatocellular carcinoma. Further research is required to clarify the mechanism and clinical significance of this novel finding.",,"Szalay, F.;Hantos, M. B.;Horvath, A.;Lakatos, P.

2209,Tetrathiomolybdate in the treatment of acute hepatitis in an animal model of Wilson's disease,"Background/Aims: Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a potent copper chelator that has been shown to be effective in Wilson's disease patients with neurological symptoms. Here we examine the potential use of TTM in the treatment of acute hepatic copper toxicosis in Long-Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats, an authentic model of Wilson's disease. Methods: After the onset of acute hepatitis, LEC rats were treated once with 10 mg TTM/kg. After 1 and 4 days, parameters of liver toxicity and the subcellular distribution and binding of copper and iron were examined. Results: TTM rapidly improved acute hepatitis in 11 of 12 rats. Hepatic copper decreased with the removal of cytosolic metallothionein and lysosomal metallothionein polymers. The remaining lysosomal copper forms a metallothionein-copper-TTM complex. However, in a nearly moribund rat, TTM caused severe hepatotoxicity with a fatal outcome. Conclusions: TTM is effective in treating acute hepatitis in LEC rats when applied before the animals become moribund. TTM appears to work by removing the putatively reactive copper associated with lysosomal metallothionein polymers. The remaining lysosomal copper appears to be inactivated by forming a complex with TTM. In addition, TTM removes copper from copper-containing metallothionein in the cytosol. As a result, metallothionein is degraded and the uptake of copper metallothionein into the lysosome and the formation of copper associated with the metallothionein polymer is reduced. © 2003 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

2211,Genotype-Phenotype Correlations for a Broad Range of Mutations in the Wilson Disease Gene (ATP7B),"Wilson disease (WND) is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene and exhibits significant allelic heterogeneity. In this study, we report the results of molecular analyzes of 20 previously undescribed WND families. Combined with our previous results, the cohort includes 93 index patients from 69 unrelated families. Twenty different mutations accounted for 86% of the WND chromosomes. The most common were p.H1069Q (35%), p.R969Q (12%), c.2530delA (7%), p.L936X (7%), p.Q289X (7%) and P.I1148T (3%) . We also present here a detailed phenotypic assessment for patients whose molecular outcome has been previously reported. Thirty cases were homozygous for 9 different mutations, 13 of which were homozygous for p.H1069Q and 7 for p.R969Q. Mutations p.H1069Q and p.R969Q appeared to confer milder disease as patients showed disease onset at a later age, and were associated with milder severity when found in transsexuals with severe mutations. Predicted nonsense and frameshift mutations were associated with severe phenotypic expression with earlier disease onset and lower ceruloplasmin levels. WND can be treated with copper chelation therapy, particularly if the disease is diagnosed before irreversible tissue damage occurs. Our results on the effect of predicted nonsense and frameshift mutations are particularly important for early medical intervention in pre-symptomatic infants and children with these genotypes. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Panagiotakaki, E.;Tzetis, M.;Manolaki, N.;Loudianos, G.;Papatheodorou, A.;Manesis, E.;Nousia-Arvanitakis, S.;Syriopoulou, V.;Kanavakis, E.",2004,2022-12-01 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.a.30345,0,0,

2214,Juvenile emphysema in a patient receiving long-term administration of D-penicillamine for Wilson's disease. [Japanese],"27-year-old man who is currently a smoker was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at age 13 due to slurred speech and tremors. He had been on D-penicillamine for 14 years when he was hospitalized with severe dyspnea and hypoxemia. Lung function tests indicated airflow obstruction and areas of low attenuation were identified by high-resolution chest computed tomography. He underwent a thoracoscopic biopsy to rule out obstructive bronchiolitis. Microscopic examination of the lung tissue showed emphysematous changes in both the centrilobular and subpleural areas with massive elastosis on the walls. There was also noticeable elastosis in the bronchiole wall. Although the coincidental coexistence of Wilson's disease and juvenile emphysema could not be ruled out, it is speculated that prolonged administration of D-penicillamine, a known lathyrogen, may have caused juvenile emphysema in this case. Therefore, patients receiving D-penicillamine should be advised to stop smoking in such a case.",,"Usuki, J.;Suzuki, M.;Sakakibara, K.;Enomoto, T.;Azuma, A.;Yoshimura, A.;Kida, K.;Kunugi, S.;Fukuda, Y.;Kudoh, S.",2004,,,0,0,

2217,"Inhibitory effects of trientine, a copper chelator, on the induction of DNA strand breaks in Long Evans cinnamon rat liver cells","The effects of treatment with trientine, a specific copper chelating agent, on copper accumulation and induction of DNA strand breaks were studied in Long Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats, an animal model of human Wilson's disease. Copper accumulated in an age-dependent manner in the liver of LEC rats aged 4 to 13 weeks. When LEC rats were treated with trientine from 10 weeks of age, hepatic copper levels did not increase and remained at the same level as in 10-week-old LEC rats. When the amounts of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) were estimated by a comet assay, SSBs of DNA were induced in a sizable population of liver cells from LEC rats around 8 weeks of age, and the amounts of SSBs increased age-dependently with age from 8 to 15 weeks. When LEC rats were treated with trientine from 10 weeks of age, the observed number of cells with DNA damage decreased dramatically, suggesting that induction of SSBs was inhibited by DNA and/or repaired SSBs during the trientine treatment period became. The results show that treatment of LEC rats with trientine reduces the number of observed DNA strand breaks, although liver copper levels remain high. © 2004 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Hayashi, M.;Miyane, K.;Hirooka, T.;Endoh, D.;Higuchi, H.;Nagahata, H.;Nakayama, K.;Kon, Y.;Okui, T.",2004,2022-11-01 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2004.07.006,0,0,

Methods: Using RT-PCR to amplify a 1.95 kb fragment of the copper binding domain of Wilson protein (WCBD) and clone it into pGEX-4T-1, the GST-WCBD was transformed into BL-21 under IPTG induction expressed. The GST-WCBD was purified with GST columns, the GST part was cleaved with thrombin and the WCBD was recovered. Metal bonding properties to Cu(II), Zn(II), Fe(III), Ni(II), Ag(I) were performed using IMAC and <sup>65</sup>Zn blotting analyses. Results: The WCBD was found to have different affinities for different metals as follows: Cu(I) > Zn(II) > Ni(II) > Cu(II). It was discovered that Zn(II) is able to compete with Cu(I) in the binding domain. Conclusion: It has been proposed to demonstrate the Wilson protein yielding copper as Cu(I).

2224,Postural tremor in Wilson's disease: A magnetoencephalographic study,"The following study included 5 patients with Wilson's disease (WD) presenting with right-sided postural forearm tremor (4-6 Hz) and addressed the question of whether the primary motor cortex (M1) is involved in tremor generation. Using a 122-lead whole-head neuromagnetometer and a surface electromyogram (EMG), we examined cerebromuscular coupling. Postural tremor was observed with a sustained 45 degree posture of the right forearm. The data were analyzed using coherent source dynamic imaging (DICS), revealing a cerebromuscular coupling between EMG and cerebral activity. Coherent sources were overlaid on individual high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MRI) images. Using a Hilbert transform of both signals, phase shifts between EMG and cerebral areas with the strongest coherence were determined. In all patients, postural tremor was associated with a strong coherence between tremor EMG and activity in the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1) at tremor or double tremor frequency. Phase lag values between S1/M1 activity and EMG revealed efferent and afferent components in the corticomuscular coupling. Taken together, our results indicate that postural tremor in WD is mediated by a pathologic vibrational drive from the primary motor cortex. © 2004 Society for Movement Disorders.",,"Sudmeyer, M.;Pollok, B.;Hefter, H.;Gross, J.;Wojtecki, L.;Butz, M.;Timmermann, L.;Schnitzler, A.",2004,December,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.20240,0,0,
2225,movement disorders in pregnancy,"With a few exceptions, movement disorders are not particularly common during pregnancy. RLS is the most common, followed by CG. Because the incidence of rheumatic fever is currently lower than before, any woman who develops CG should be screened for diseases other than rheumatic heart disease. The differential includes systemic lupus erythromatosis and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [21]. Regarding the use of dopaminergic drugs, the dopamine agonist pergolide can be maintained during pregnancy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, Segawa disease and RLS. The use of levodopa and ropinirole should be restricted during pregnancy because of possible teratogenic effects. Amantadine is contraindicated during pregnancy [54]. The data on selegiline is controversial; Animal experiments show possible serotonergic effects [52] and teratogenic effects [53]. When treatment is indicated in patients with Tourette's syndrome, the highly potent antipsychotics (haloperidol) are preferred to treat associated symptoms [38]. Depression is a common comorbidity in patients with PD, HD, Tourette's syndrome or other chronic neurological disorders. The treatment of depression during pregnancy is reviewed by Levy et al. discussed elsewhere in this issue. As already mentioned, most of the data on the use of drugs during pregnancy, especially on dopaminergic drugs, is limited to animal studies and case reports.

2231,Metals in our minds: Therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative diseases,"Background Abnormal interactions of brain copper or iron with metal-binding proteins (such as amyloid beta peptide [Abeta] or neuromelanin) leading to oxidative stress have emerged as important potential mechanisms in brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Although a controlled trial of desferrioxamine in Alzheimer's disease (AD) had some promising results, concerns about toxicity and brain delivery have limited trials with traditional chelating agents. The therapeutic relevance of metal dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases remains difficult to assess. Recent developments Clioquinol has been identified as a prototype metal-protein-attenuating compound (MPAC). In a blinded and controlled 9-week study of a mouse model of AD, oral clioquinol reduced brain Abeta by 49% with no systemic toxicity. Brain levels of copper and zinc increased by about 15% in mice treated with clioquinol. Two other studies in mice showed that increasing brain copper concentrations through diet or genetics could decrease amyloid burden and increase survival. A recent placebo-controlled study in 36 patients with AD showed that clioquinol (250-750 mg daily) reduced plasma concentrations of Abeta<inf>1-42</inf>, increased plasma concentrations of zinc and - in a subgroup with moderate dementia - Slowed cognitive decline over 24 weeks. Two recent experiments also demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of iron chelates in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Where next? The experimental and transgenic animal studies on metal-protein interactions are convincing, but provide neither conclusive answers on causality nor whether this strategy protects against neurodegeneration in humans. The finding that clioquinol may modulate plasma concentrations of amyloid and cognition in patients with AD needs to be interpreted with caution but is an important first step. Clioquinol was withdrawn in Japan over concerns about its association with subacute myelo-optic neuropathy; Therefore, any additional studies of this drug will likely be small and closely monitored proof-of-concept studies. The development of optimal second-generation MPACs is a worthy goal and may provide better insights into the importance of metal-protein interactions in several neurodegenerative diseases.",,"Doraiswamy, P.

2234,Inhibition of key cytokines by tetrathiomolybdate in the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis,"Tetrathiomolybdate is an anti-copper drug with a unique mechanism of action. Tetrathiomolybdate complexes copper with protein and itself, making the copper unavailable for cellular uptake. It was originally developed for Wilson's disease and is now being developed as an antiangiogenic agent to treat cancer. Many angiogenic cytokines require normal levels of copper, and decreased levels of copper reduce cytokine signaling while meeting cellular copper requirements. Cytokines of fibrosis and inflammation may be similarly copper dependent since tetrathiomolybdate inhibits bleomycin-induced pneumonia and fibrosis. The basis for this inhibition was evaluated here by examining the effects of tetrathiomolybdate on pulmonary cytokines, which are pathophysiologically important, in the bleomycin mouse model of lung injury. Results in mice endotracheally injected with bleomycin confirmed that tetrathiomolybdate therapy was effective in reducing fibrosis. This effect was associated with a significant inhibition of bleomycin-induced expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and transforming growth factor beta in lung homogenates. These effects turned out to be independent of each other. This indicates that tetrathiomolybdate therapy may be effective even when the fibrosis is in a more chronic stage where inflammatory cytokines play a diminishing role. Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha suggests that tumor necrosis factor alpha overexpression diseases are also potential targets of tetrathiomolybdate therapy. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Paracetamol intoxication is therefore a significant burden on the healthcare system and a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Tetrathiomolybdate is a fast-acting anticopper drug developed for Wilson's disease. However, when copper levels are lowered with tetrathiomolybdate, anticancer effects are achieved in both animal models and human patients. Inhibition of angiogenic cytokines by tetrathiomolybdate is the hypothetical mechanism. Tetrathiomolybdate has also been shown to be effective against organ damage in the bleomycin mouse model of lung damage and in concanavalin A and carbon tetrachloride models of liver damage. Again, the hypothetical mechanism is cytokine inhibition, in this case inhibition of profibrotic and proinflammatory cytokines. In the present work in mice, we show that tetrathiomolybdate protects a liver damage from paracetamol.

2242,Copper deficiency myelopathy produces a clinical picture like subacute combined degeneration,"Background: Copper deficiency is known to cause atactic myelopathy in ruminants. Copper deficiency as a cause of progressive myelopathy in adults is underrecognized. Aim: To describe clinical, biochemical, electrophysiological, and imaging features in 13 patients with copper deficiency-related myelopathy. METHODS: The records of patients with copper deficiency-associated myelopathy were reviewed. Clinical features, laboratory investigations, and responses to therapeutic interventions were summarized. Results: Thirteen such patients were found, eleven of them within a period of 15 months. All patients presented with marked gait difficulties reflecting sensory ataxia due to dorsal column dysfunction and lower extremity spasticity. All patients had polyneuropathy. High or high normal serum zinc levels were observed in 7 of the 11 patients for whom this information was available. Somatosensory evoked potential studies performed on eight patients revealed impaired conduction in central proprioceptive pathways. A signal change of the dorsal column was present in the MRI of the spine in three patients. A first clue to the diagnosis was a very low level of ceruloplasmin; further testing of copper metabolism ruled out Wilson's disease. The cause remained unclear in most patients. Oral copper supplementation restored normal or near-normal copper levels in 7 of the 12 patients for whom adequate follow-up data were available; in 3 other patients, parenteral supplementation restored normal levels. Copper supplementation prevented further neurological deterioration, but the degree of actual improvement varied. Conclusions: Unrecognized copper deficiency appears to be a common cause of idiopathic myelopathy in adults. The clinical picture shows striking similarities with the syndrome of subacute combined degeneration in vitamin B12 deficiency.

For WM patients in India, there is no information on the mutation in the ATP7B gene and haplotypes using linked markers. Therefore, the present study was conducted to identify presymptomatic siblings of WM-affected individuals in families with multiple offspring using a PCR-based molecular diagnostic test. Methods: Genomic DNA was prepared from the peripheral blood of patients, siblings and their first-degree relatives. The repeat markers flanking the WD locus were amplified by PCR using fluorescently labeled primers. Amplified DNA fragments were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the ABI 377 DNA sequencing system. The samples were genotyped using Genescan software. Haplotypes were determined based on the segregation of alleles in the families studied. Results: Among 15 families with multiple children affected by WM, 4 cases were identified in which younger siblings had the same genotype as the patient on all three analyzed markers. In addition, eight different haplotypes were detected in the four patients. Interpretation and conclusion: The siblings of WM patients who carried the same genotype at the markers associated with the WM locus were presymptomatically diagnosed individuals. The presence of eight different haplotypes in the four patients indicated mutational heterogeneity at the WD locus. The test aids clinicians in therapeutic intervention in suspected cases of copper-chelated WM before the onset of overt clinical symptoms.",,"Gupta, A.;Neogi, R.;Mukherjea, M.;Mukhopadhyay, A.;Roychoudhury, S.;Senapati, A.;Gangopadhyay, P.

2252,Liver support - A job for nephrologists? Extracorporeal treatment of a patient with fulminant Wilson crisis,"Background: Patients with Wilson's disease may present with cirrhosis, acute hepatitis, or fulminant liver failure. In the absence of urgent orthotopic liver transplantation, fulminant Wilson crisis has a 100% mortality rate. We report on an 18-year-old patient with fulminant liver failure due to Wilson's crisis. Methods: The Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) was used to eliminate albumin-bound toxins and to bridge the waiting time for organ availability. Results: A total of 18 MARS sessions and 4 plasma exchange sessions were performed. Bilirubin levels and hepatic encephalopathy improved with MARS therapy. A total of 75 mg of copper was removed until serum copper levels were within the normal range. Copper removal was measured in 15 MARS treatments, which removed a total of 12.9 mg of copper. Four plasma exchange sessions with a total exchange of 11 liters of plasma removed 12 mg of copper. The urinary copper excretion with penicillamine was 50 mg. Conclusion: MARS was an effective method of stabilizing a patient with Wilson's crisis, contributing to copper elimination and gaining time for liver transplantation. The risk of high-urgency transplantation could be avoided. Liver support was easy in the hands of nephrologists familiar with extracorporeal therapy. Copyright © 2003 S.

2253,Tetrathiomolybdate therapy protects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice,"Tetrathiomolybdate(TM), a drug developed to treat Wilson's disease, produces an antiangiogenic effect by lowering systemic copper levels. Several angiogenic cytokines appear to depend on normal levels of copper for their activity. In both animal tumor models and cancer patients, TM therapy has been shown to be effective in inhibiting tumor growth. We have hypothesized that the activities of fibrotic and inflammatory cytokines are also subject to modulation by copper availability, similar to angiogenic cytokines. As a first step to assess whether TM has a therapeutic role in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, we examined the effects of TM in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Oral TM therapy resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in serum ceruloplasmin, a surrogate marker for systemic copper levels. Significant decreases in systemic copper levels were associated with a marked reduction in pulmonary fibrosis, as determined based on histopathological findings and a biochemical measurement of fibrosis. The protection afforded by TM was also reflected in a significantly reduced bleomycin-induced body weight loss. In the next phase of this work, we will attempt to determine the mechanisms by which TM produces these therapeutic benefits.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Ullenbruch, M. R.;Dick, R.;Olivarez, L.;Phan, S.

We measured the passive and active fine motor skills of 37 WM patients and 24 randomly selected volunteers. The measurement was based on a standardized test set in a defined environment to detect impaired fine motor skills. The set contains 5 tests consisting of resting tremor, postural tremor, target tapping, index finger tapping and spiral painting that reflect different aspects of movement disorders. The tests revealed significant differences between neurological MV and volunteers, particularly on tasks that define active control. In neurological WM we found no differences between the subgroups, while in non-neurological WM we often found mild movement disorders. The identified movement disorders can be interpreted as persistent disorders after long-term therapy.",,"Hermann, W.;Villmann, T.;Grahmann, F.;Kuhn, H.

TM is a powerful, fast-acting, non-toxic anti-copper agent. Copper appears to be required for the activity of many angiogenic factors, leading to the testing of TM as an anti-angiogenic anti-cancer agent. Positive results have been obtained in several animal tumor models and the results in early clinical work are encouraging. TM may be a more global antiangiogenic agent than most agents being developed, as many angiogenic factors appear to be copper dependent in some way. The main toxicity of TM is bone marrow suppression from overtreatment. Recently, TM has been shown to inhibit key profibrotic and proinflammatory cytokines, and the preclinical status of TM therapy has been positive in lung and liver models of inflammation and fibrosis. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

2256,Diagnosis and treatment of Wilson's disease Experience from 38 years of therapy in a specialized outpatient clinic. [German],"Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive hereditary disease, is caused by more than 200 different mutations in the gene (locus 13q14.3) that encodes a copper-transporting ATPase 7B. Hepatic manifestations appear primarily in the first decade of life, neurological and psychiatric ones in the second or third decade of life, rarely later. Genotype-phenotype correlations are likely. The diagnosis is made by laboratory tests (Cu metabolism), molecular genetics and, if necessary, liver biopsy. Treatment must be continued without interruption for life, including during pregnancy. In addition to D-penicillamine, which has been the drug of choice for many years, trientine, zinc and tetrathiomolybdate have been used with good success. Monitoring (copper balance, side effects) - at least once or twice a year - is required. Cerebral MRI and FDG-PET appear to be useful tools for long-term therapy in practice. The continuous care of Wilson patients (38, 10 of them without hepatic or neurological symptoms) in a specialized outpatient clinic since 1964 has proven its worth. 31 patients who were consistently treated with D-penicillamine tolerated the drug well with few side effects. Marked neurological symptoms also improved, and some patients became practically symptom-free. All patients without clinical symptoms remained symptom-free. In case of intolerance to D-penicillamine, trientine and zinc are an effective alternative therapy. Recurrent hepatic decompensations were observed in 2 patients. One of them eventually required a liver transplant. 19 pregnancies were carried to term without complications or fetal damage while taking medication (17 with D-penicillamine, 2 with trientine and zinc). Discontinuation of therapy resulted in fatal liver failure in one pregnant patient.",,"Kunath, B.;Reuner, U.",2003,February,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-2003-37060,0,1,
2257,Copper-lowering therapy with tetrathiomolybdate in cancer and fibrotic and inflammatory diseases,"Angiogenesis is required for tumor growth and is a likely Achilles heel for cancer. However, anti-angiogenic agents have been somewhat disappointing in cancer therapy, perhaps because they target a single angiogenic factor and there is much redundancy in angiogenic systems. Copper is required for high levels of angiogenesis, and many angiogenic factors require copper. Therefore, anti-copper drugs offer the possibility of more extensive inhibition. Our group has developed tetrathiomolybdate(TM) for the initial treatment of neurological Wilson's disease. Penicillamine causes neurological deterioration in about 50% of these patients, and many never recover. Only 2 out of 55 (3.6%) patients worsened during treatment with TM. Because TM exhibited desirable properties such as efficacy, rapidity, and safety, we evaluated it as an antiangiogenic agent. We hypothesize that when copper is lowered to an intermediate range, cellular needs for copper are met but angiogenic cytokine signaling is inhibited. TM has demonstrated potent inhibition of cancer growth in five rodent models, encouraging results in a dog study in advanced and metastatic cancer, and encouraging results in a phase 1/2 study in advanced and metastatic cancer in 42 patients. Finally, we hypothesized that the pathway of fibrosis involving transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and connective tissue growth factor can be inhibited by copper-lowering therapy with TM. This signaling pathway is overactive and dysregulated in many fibrotic diseases. In animal studies, TM completely inhibited bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, concanavalin A-induced hepatitis, and carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis. We find that TM inhibits transforming growth factor beta and the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Brewer, G.

Treatment and Outcome: The patient's lesions improved significantly after reducing her penicillamine dose to 500 mg daily. Conclusions: It is important to recognize the cutaneous side effects of long-term penicillamine therapy as they can be associated with significant morbidity and may be markers of more ominous underlying systemic elastic fiber damage.",,"Tang, M.

2262,Excess dietary histidine decreases hepatic copper levels and serum alanine aminotransferase activity in Long Evans cinnamon rats,"Long-Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats spontaneously develop fulminant hepatitis associated with excessive Cu accumulation in the liver: they are therefore considered an animal model for Wilson's disease. In the present study, we investigated the ability of excess dietary histidine to reduce excessive hepatic Cu accumulation in LEC rats by comparing them to Fischer rats. The results clearly showed that the histidine excess diet markedly stimulated urinary Cu excretion and significantly reduced liver Cu content by 47.5% in LEG rats. Serum Cu levels in LEC rats were unaffected by excess dietary histidine. We also compared the effects of excess dietary histidine on some liver antioxidant enzyme activities, liver and serum lipid levels, and serum alanine aminotransferase activity of LEC and Fischer rats. Dietary histidine decreased the activities of total and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase in the liver of both strains. In LEC rats, liver cholesterol decreased and serum cholesterol and phospholipid levels increased when fed the histidine-excess diet. When fed the basal diet, serum alanine aminotransferase activity was higher in LEC rats than in Fischer rats, but a significant decrease in serum alanine aminotransferase activity of LEC rats was observed when fed the histidine-excess diet. These results suggest that excess dietary histidine is effective in removing Cu ions from the liver of LEC rats. Therefore, it may be useful in preventing or treating liver damage in LEC rats and in Wilson's disease patients.",,"Xu, H.;Sakakibara, S.;Morifuji, M.;Salamatulla, Q.;Aoyama, Y.",2003,2022-09-01 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/BJN2003939,0,0,

2269,Wilson's disease: the importance of non-immunological measurement of serum ceruloplasmin,"Wilson's disease should be considered as a possible diagnosis in any child, adolescent, or young adult with unexplained liver damage, particularly if hemolysis is present. However, it can also occur in adolescents or young adults with neurological symptoms that are limited to the motor system. The first diagnostic screening test is the determination of the serum ceruloplasmin and the total serum copper concentration with calculation of the serum non-ceruloplasmin-bound (“free”) copper. Serum ceruloplasmin containing copper is best determined by measuring its oxidase activity since the immunonephelometric method measures both ceruloplasmin and the biologically inactive apo form. Diagnosis can be confirmed by increased urinary copper excretion. All close relatives of an identified patient must be examined and if there is any doubt, an examination of the Wilson gene on chromosome 13q14.3 can be performed. Lifelong follow-up is best done at a specialized center. Adherence to chelation therapy (penicillamine or trientine) or administration of the metal antagonist tetrathiomolybdate or zinc is monitored by measuring ""free"" serum copper, which should be maintained at or near 1.6 µmol/L (10 cups/100 mL).

We also examined the change in the activity of antioxidant enzymes and determined the biochemical profile in the blood and the metal content in the urine. We showed that the Zn treated group had higher levels of MT in the liver and gut cells than both the untreated and basal groups. Tissue Zn concentrations were significantly higher in the Zn-treated group compared to the untreated and basal, while Cu and Fe concentrations decreased. Antioxidant enzyme activities in the Zn-treated group did not change significantly compared to those in the basic group, with the exception of hepatic glutathione peroxidase activity. In addition, the biochemical data in the blood of the Zn-treated group clearly do not detect liver damage.

2274,"Copper toxicity, oxidative stress and antioxidant nutrients","Copper (Cu) is an integral part of many important enzymes involved in a number of vital biological processes. Although normally bound to proteins, Cu can be liberated and released to catalyze the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. Data from in vitro and cell culture studies largely support Cu's ability to initiate oxidative damage and disrupt important cellular events. Oxidative damage has been linked to chronic Cu overload and/or exposure to excess Cu caused by accidents, occupational hazards, and pollution. Additionally, Cu-induced oxidative damage has been linked to disorders related to abnormal Cu metabolism and neurodegenerative changes. Interestingly, dietary Cu deficiency also increases cellular susceptibility to oxidative damage. A number of nutrients have been shown to interact with Cu and alter its cellular effects. Vitamin E generally protects against Cu-induced oxidative damage. While most in vitro or cell culture studies show that ascorbic acid exacerbates Cu-induced oxidative damage, results from available animal studies suggest the compound is protective. High intake of ascorbic acid and zinc may provide protection against Cu toxicity by preventing excess Cu intake. Zinc also removes Cu from its binding site where it can cause free radical formation. Beta-carotene, alpha-lipoic acid, and polyphenols have also been shown to attenuate Cu-induced oxidative damage. Further studies are needed to better understand the cellular effects of this essential but potentially toxic trace element and its functional interaction with other nutrients. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

2275,Animal models of copper-associated liver disease,"Recent advances in molecular biology have enabled the identification of genetic defects responsible for Wilson's disease, Indian childhood cirrhosis, and copper toxicosis in Long Evans cinnamon rats, toxic milk mice, and Bedlington terriers. The Wilson disease gene is located on human chromosome 13 and encodes ATP7B, a copper-transporting P-type ATPase. A genetic defect similar to that of Wilson's disease occurs in Long Evans cinnamon rats and toxic milk mice. Familial copper storage disorders in Bedlington and West Highland White Terriers are associated with early subclinical disease and copper accumulation with subsequent liver damage culminating in cirrhosis. The canine copper toxicosis locus in Bedlington terriers has been mapped to the canine chromosomal region CFA 10q26. Recently, a mutated MURR1 gene was discovered in Bedlington terriers affected by the disease. Childhood idiopathic cirrhosis is biochemically similar to copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers but clinically much more severe. Both conditions are characterized by the absence of neurological damage and Kayser-Fleisher rings and normal levels of ceruloplasmin. A recent study added North Ronaldsay sheep to the list of promising animal models for studying cirrhosis in children in India. Morphologic similarities between the two conditions include periportal to panlobular copper retention and liver changes ranging from active hepatitis to panlobular pericellular fibrosis and cirrhosis. Certain copper-associated disorders, such as chronic active hepatitis in Doberman pinschers and Skye terrier hepatitis, are characterized by copper retention as a consequence of the underlying disease and thus resemble primary biliary cirrhosis in humans. Copper-associated liver disease is increasingly recognized in Dalmatians. Copper-associated liver disease in Dalmatian and Long Evans cinnamon rats share many morphological features. Fulminant liver failure in Dalmatians is characterized by high serum activities of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase and severe necrosis of the centrilobular areas (periazinar, zone 3) hepatocytes. Macrophages and surviving hepatocytes contain copper-positive material. Liver disease associated with periazine copper accumulation has also been described in Siamese cats. Many questions remain to be answered about copper metabolism in mammals, the genetic background, pathogenesis and treatment of copper-associated liver diseases.

Wilson's disease or hepatolenticular degeneration is an autosomal recessive disease. It is caused by defective hepatic excretion of copper. The disease is fatal without treatment. Prevention of serious permanent damage depends on early detection and diagnosis, followed by appropriate lifelong anticopper treatment.

2277,Wilson's disease. [Croatian],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The Wilson disease protein is a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, ATP7B, whose malfunction leads to the toxic accumulation of copper in the liver and brain, causing the hepatic and/or neurological symptoms that accompany this disease. Patients generally present between the ages of 10 and 40 years with liver disease, a movement-type neurological disease, or behavioral problems, and often a combination of these. Because Wilson's disease can be treated effectively, it is extremely important that doctors learn to recognize and diagnose the disease. Laboratory diagnosis of Wilson's disease is confirmed by decreased serum ceruloplasmin, increased urinary copper, and increased hepatic copper. Molecular genetic analysis is complex as more than 200 unique mutations have been identified and most individuals are composite heterozygotes. Treatment for Wilson's disease is lifelong. Copper chelation with penicillamine is an effective therapy in most patients. Another chelating agent that has been used successfully as an initial therapy is trientine. The search for new anti-copper drugs for Wilson's disease has culminated in two excellent new drugs: zinc for maintenance therapy and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (which remains an experimental drug to date) for initial therapy. Liver transplantation is indicated in the fulminant form and in patients with severe disease who do not respond to optimal medical management.

Although this psychiatric symptom was well controlled with pharmacological treatment for two years, by the age of 20 she developed olfactory paranoia, as well as sialorrhoea, dysarthria and finger tremors. A year later, rigidity appeared, also present in the extremities. At the age of 23, based on hematological studies, an idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was diagnosed. As her extrapyramidal symptoms were progressive, she was referred to our department for an assessment of her neurological condition. She was diagnosed with Wilson's disease based on (1) the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, (2) extrapyramidal signs, and (3) decreased serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels. Brain MRI T2 and FLAIR images showed hyperintense lesions in the putamen, thalamus, and pontine tegmentum. Diffusion-weighted images also revealed hyperintense lesions in the thalamus and pontine tegmentum. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis with copper accumulation. Since starting treatment with D-penicillamine, she has shown no olfactory paranoia and no worsening of ITP. Her gait disorder has also improved.

2280,Rare but important chronic liver diseases. [German],"The presence of steatosis and inflammatory infiltrate in liver biopsies is essential for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). These findings are similar to those seen in alcoholic liver disease. However, alcohol does not play a major role in the NASH situation. Risk factors for the development of NASH are obesity and diabetes. Most patients are clinically asymptomatic. This means that a NASH diagnosis is a diagnosis of exclusion: virus-induced, autoimmune, metabolic and toxic liver diseases must be ruled out. The disease has a benign clinical course. The risk of cirrhosis is low. So far there is no established treatment. Preliminary reports indicate a beneficial effect of weight loss and ursodeoxycholic acid. Wilson's disease, a copper storage disease in which biliary copper excretion is reduced, is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most patients with Wilson disease become symptomatic between the ages of 6 and 15 years. In approximately 90% of patients, serum ceruloplasmin levels and serum copper concentrations are reduced. The copper excretion is increased. Histological examination of liver biopsy specimens reveals fatty infiltration, Mallory bodies, and ballooned glycogen nuclei, abnormalities also found in alcoholic liver disease. The meaningful diagnostic parameter is the quantitative determination of the liver copper content (> 250 micrograms/g dry weight). Left untreated, Wilson's disease is always fatal. Lifelong treatment with anti-copper drugs is essential, with D-penicillamine being the first-line therapy. Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an iron overload disease that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The frequency of the disease is high. The first symptoms usually appear between the ages of 20-50. Arthralgia develops in up to 50% of patients. Many organs are affected, most commonly the liver. The organ is usually enlarged, the transaminases are always moderately elevated. Laboratory findings reveal a significant increase in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. More than 80% of HH patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. The first-line treatment for HH is phlebotomy. The treatment is lifelong. If serum ferritin falls below 50 micrograms/L, the frequency of phlebotomy should be reduced (4-12 per year). If cirrhosis is already present, the HCC risk is very high.",,"Maier, K.

2282,Appropriate dosing schedule of D-penicillamine for pediatric patients with Wilson's disease based on urinary copper excretion. [Japanese],"The purpose of this study was to increase the amount of excreted copper following administration of D-penicillamine (DP) in pediatric patients with Wilson's disease (WD). By measuring urinary copper excretion after adjustment of administration regimens, the appropriate timing for DP administration was studied. The subjects were three brothers with pediatric MV. The initial daily dose of DP was 5 mg/kg/day and was gradually increased to the maintenance dose of 20 mg/kg/day. DP was administered 2 hours after morning and evening meals until the daily maintenance dose was reached. After reaching the daily maintenance dose of DP, the appropriate time to take DP both in the morning and in the evening was investigated. Three schedules of DP administration were compared: 2 h after meals; 30 min before meals (with fasting); and 1 h before morning and l.5 before dinner (direction 1). The resulting urinary copper excretion for each dosing regimen was compared. A small difference in urinary copper excretion was noted at the first two schedules, ie 2 h after meals and 30 min before meals. When DP was administered 30 minutes before meals, the urinary copper excretion [cup/day] was 1173 in the first brother, 918 in the second, and 875 in the third. However, when DP was administered according to Instruction 1, urinary copper excretion was significantly increased to 1701 in the first brother, 2701 in the second and 3808 in the third. It is known that the efficiency of urinary copper excretion upon DP administration depends on the maintenance of chelating ability after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Our results indicate that elimination was less when DP was administered 2 h after or 30 min before meals (fasted), as recommended in the package insert. Direction 1 is therefore recommended for WM patients to achieve better copper excretion efficiency. © 2002 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",,"Fukuoka, N.;Morita, S.;Hamatani, S.;Okada, H.;Kondoh, M.;Imai, T.;Ohnishi, S.;Itoh, S.",2002,August,http://dx.doi.org/10.1248/yakushi.122.585,0,0,

[Italian],"Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is a rare skin disorder characterized by the transepithelial elimination of abnormal dermal elastic fibers. This disease can be divided into three forms: idiopathic EPS; EPS in connection with specific genetic connective tissue defects and D-penicillamine-induced EPS after prolonged high-dose therapy in Wilson's disease, cystinuria, rheumatoid arthritis. A 28-year-old man with Wilson's disease since the age of 18 and since then on prolonged treatment with D-penicillamine, noticed the appearance of multiple keratotic papules in serpentine and ring-like patterns along the neck and right arm, respectively, two years ago Biopsy samples by light microscopy showed the characteristic changes of EPS, both idiopathic and D-penicillamine-induced. Examination by transmission electron microscopy revealed characteristic changes in the elastic fibers of D-penicillamine-induced EPS that have not previously been described in idiopathic EPS. D-penicillamine is a life-saving drug in the treatment of Wilson's disease, as a copper chelator, despite the well-documented systemic and cutaneous adverse effects that are produced. The pathogenic mechanism of dermatopathy and how D-penicillamine induces the changes in elastic fibers with their subsequent extrusion on the skin surface is unknown; some pathogenic hypotheses are proposed.",,"Pinna, A.

2287,"Wilson's disease. Clinical presentation, treatment and development in 21 cases. [French]","Purpose - Wilson's disease is characterized by neuropsychiatric symptoms with frequent extrapyramidal and intellectual presentations. They have an insidious development that leads to late diagnosis and lower therapeutic efficacy in the advanced forms. Methods - We report 21 cases of Wilson's disease with neurological complications, emphasizing clinical semiology, diagnostic tools and problems of therapeutics in our country. Results - The mean age at onset was 17.6 years, with a female prevalence (8/13). The symptoms were initially mostly all neurological (71.4%), then psychiatric (19%) or hepatic (19%). The most common neurological symptoms were limb dystonia (81%), dysarthria (76%), tremors (76%) or motor disorders (71.4%). Sometimes there was sialorrhea or handwriting disorders. The Kayser-Fleischer ring was present in 19 patients. Eighteen patients had clinical and/or biological liver involvement. The diagnosis was confirmed by biochemical tests, which revealed a low level of copper in the blood, a declining level of ceruloplasmin and a very high level of copper in the urine. Cerebral computed tomography shows cortical and/or subcortical atrophy (37%) and/or low central gray nucleus density (35%). Treatment was based on D-penicillamine and/or zinc sulfate, depending on drug availability. The course was favorable in 18 patients (85%) and poor in 42.8% of the cases. Six of the first patients developed poorly after many years of follow-up. Finally, only 12 patients (57%) had a very good result. The family investigation carried out in 17 patients revealed 13 family cases. The only predictive factor for poor outcome was therapeutic noncompliance (P=0.006). Conclusions - The neurological presentations are traditional during Wilson's disease but are often ignored. We must suspect the disease in children when faced with writing disorders or school failure, and in adults when faced with neurological symptoms in a patient with liver disease. We must not hesitate to consider it even in the case of purely psychiatric signs, and we should know better to look for the neurological ones. © 2002 Editions Scientifiques et Medicales Elsevier SAS.",,"Bono, W.;Moutie, O.;Benomar, A.;Aidi, S.;El Alaoui-Faris, M.;Yahyaoui, M.;Chkili, T.",2002,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0248-8663%2802%2900589-1,0,1,

2289,Current principles of Wilson's disease - diagnosis and treatment. [Polishing],"Wilson's disease, also defined as hepatolenticular degeneration, is an important clinical problem in young adults that still presents diagnostic difficulties. Over the past decade, the genetic background of the disease has been definitively established and elucidated, confirming the diversity of genetic mutations responsible for its origin. The current scheme of treatment of the disease has been worked out and established. It aims to remove the excess of toxic copper ions from the organism as quickly as possible. In the initial phase of treatment, administration of conventional and recently introduced chelating agents usually results in immediate clearance of copper deposits from tissues and maintenance of copper metabolism balance. In chronic therapy, zinc compounds that induce intestinal and hepatic metallothionein synthesis have found more widespread use. Lifelong, consistent, pharmacological therapy for Wilson disease, administered after its early diagnosis, allows long patient survival times that are often comparable to those of the general population.",,"Najda, J.;Stella-Holowiecka, B.;Machalski, M.;Woszczyk, D.;Mykala-Ciesla, J.",2002,,,0,0,
2290,Copper metabolism disorders and liver diseases: environmental aspects,"Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element for many biological processes. Cu homeostasis is generally well maintained by built-in controls on intestinal absorption, biliary excretion, and intrahepatic storage. Copper deficiency diseases are rare. Acute Cu toxicity occasionally occurs with accidental intoxication with Cu sulfate. Chronic Cu toxicity in the form of liver cirrhosis and damage to other organs is classically seen in Wilson's disease (genetic abnormality of Cu metabolism) and in the suspected environmental disease Indian Childhood Cirrhosis (ICC). The clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic aspects of ICC are described. The evidence linking ICC to environmental Cu is (i) grossly elevated liver Cu; (ii) early introduction of Cu-contaminated milk, boiled or stored in brass vessels; (iii) a dramatic decline in ICC across the country, coinciding with a change in feeding vessels; and (iv) sustained long-term remission in patients treated with D-penicillamine after drug discontinuation. The nature and role of a second factor in causing ICC remains unclear, although a genetic predisposition is strongly suspected. Anecdotal reports of an ICC-like disease from the West (Idiopathic Cu Toxicosis, Endemic Tyrolean Infantile Cirrhosis) suggest that different mechanisms (environmental, genetic, or both) may lead to the same end-stage liver disease - ""ecogenetic"" disorders. © 2002 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",,"Pandit, A.

[Chinese],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Gandou Tablet I (GDI), a Chinese herbal prescription, on biliary trace element levels in patients with hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD). METHODS: Before and after 4 weeks of treatment with orally ingested GDI, bile from 32 cases of HLD was collected by duodenal drainage to determine and compare biliary trace elements including copper, zinc, iron and calcium by atomic absorption spectrum spectrophotometer of 30 cases from non-HLD patients as controls. RESULTS: Levels of copper, iron, and copper/zinc ratio were apparently lower in the HLD group before GDI treatment, while calcium levels were significantly higher (P<0.01) than in the control group (P<0 .01 or P < 0.05 ), but the zinc content was not significantly different between the two groups. Biliary copper excretion was significantly increased after GDI treatment compared to before treatment (P<0.05), but levels of zinc, iron, calcium and the copper/zinc ratio were not significantly altered. CONCLUSION: Impairment of bile copper excretion was one of the mechanisms for the accumulation of copper in the body of HLD patients. GDI may promote excretion of biliary copper in HLD patients.",,"Hu, W. B.;Yang, R. M.",2001,Jul,,0,0,
2292,The hepatic form of Wilson's disease in young patients. [Czech],"Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism with a wide variety of clinical and biochemical symptoms. Hepatic and neurological forms are the most common manifestations of this rare disease. In school children and adolescents, the symptoms of liver damage predominate. In a retrospective study, 19 patients with biochemical signs of hepatopathy that manifested before the age of 18 were examined. WM was diagnosed between the ages of 7 and 27 years. A patient was admitted to the Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine in Prague with fulminant liver failure treated by acute liver transplantation. Only 9 of 18 patients with chronic liver disease at the time of diagnosis met Sternlieb's diagnostic criteria. These patients had reduced ceruloplasmin levels (0.08-0.18 g/L) and high hepatic dry matter copper (783 µg/g +/- 323 [SD]). The remaining 9 patients had normal ceruloplasmin levels, but 8 had high dry liver matter copper content (696 µg/g (+)-352[SD]. The last patient from this group had Kayser-Fleischer disease (KF ) ring. The high copper content in hepatic dry matter could only be confirmed after one year of penicillinamine treatment, since poor coagulation precluded liver biopsy at the time of diagnosis. There was a statistically significant difference in copper content in hepatic dry matter in patients who received the Met and failed criteria of Sternlieb Statistically significant differences between both groups were found in plasma copper levels and in 24-hour urinary copper excretion Histological examination of the liver under a light microscope revealed findings of minimal changes associated with the presence of glycogen nuclei in hepatocytes to picture a r active chronic hepatitis In all 19 patients, the gene mutation H1069Q was examined and the results were positive in 39.8%. It was homozygous in 3 asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSION: Early detection of the atypical form of WD remains very difficult. In all cases, the gold standard is still the determination of copper in dry liver tissue. In the near future, direct DNA analysis will also play an important role, although its use is limited not only by the large number of known mutations, but also by the financial cost of the method.",,"Smolka, V.;Frysak, Z.;Kozak, L.;Mathonova, J.;Jezdinska, V.;Novak, Z.;Hrckova, Y.;Vrabelova, S.",2000,Jan,,0,0,

To assess whether life-related liver transplantation (LRLT) can correct copper metabolism in WM patients, we studied two children who underwent LRLT for fulminant liver failure. They were 7 and 13 years old when LRLT was performed. Serum ceruloplasmin levels, serum copper levels, urinary copper excretion and hepatic copper concentrations were measured. Serum ceruloplasmin levels (16.7 +/- 1.2 mg/dL) and serum copper levels (67.0 +/- 1.4 µg/dL) were lower than the normal range in case 1 after LRLT . In both patients, urinary copper excretion was markedly reduced after LRLT, but was not normalized (case 1, 191.2 +/- 182.2 µg/day; case 2, 140.0 +/- 156.7 µg/day) . The hepatic copper concentrations were slightly increased in both cases after LRLT (case 1, 158.8 +/- 44.6 µg/g dry weight; case 2, 147.0 µg/g dry weight), but did not exceed 250 µg/g dry weight. LRLT is a curative procedure in Wilson's disease with fulminant liver failure or advanced cirrhosis. However, this study indicates that conditions of copper metabolism in WM patients undergoing LRLT are similar to those in heterozygous genetic carriers. Because the living related donors are the parents who carry the abnormal gene, LRLT cannot fully restore copper balance in WM patients.",,"Komatsu, H.;Fujisawa, T.;Inui, A.;Sogo, T.;Sekine, I.;Kodama, H.;Uemoto, S.;Tanaka, K.",2002,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1399-0012.2002.01074.x,0,0,

Laboratory tests show high levels of free serum copper, as well as high 24-hour urinary copper excretion and decreased serum ceruloplasmin. Brain scans show putamen abnormalities. A liver biopsy with high copper levels is sometimes necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Its treatment is based on low dietary copper intake and medications such as penicillamine, zinc, trientine, and tetrathiomolybdate. Cases of severe liver failure respond to liver transplantation.

2304,Introduction of Wilson's disease mutations in the zinc-transporting P-type ATPase of Escherichia coli: The mutation P634L in the “hinge” motif (GDGXNDXP) disrupts the formation of the E2P state,"ZntA, a bacterial P-type zinc-transporting ATPase, is homologous to two human ATPases that are mutated in Menkes and Wilson disease. To investigate the role of bacterial ATPase residues homologous to those involved in human disease, we introduced several point mutations in ZntA. Mutants P401L, D628A and P634L correspond to Wilson disease mutations P992L, D1267A and P1273L, respectively. The mutations D628A and P634L are located in the C-terminal part of the phosphorylation domain in the so-called hinge motif, which is conserved in all P-type ATPases. P401L is located near the N-terminal part of the phosphorylation domain, whereas the H475Q and P476L mutations affect the heavy metal ATPase-specific HP motif in the nucleotide binding domain. All mutants show a reduced ATPase activity corresponding to 0-37% of the wild type activity. The mutants P401L, H475Q and P476L are weakly phosphorylated by both ATP and P i . Their dephosphorylation rates are slow. The mutant D628A is inactive and cannot be phosphorylated at all. In contrast, mutant P634L shows normal phosphorylation by ATP six residues apart in the same domain. However, phosphorylation by Pi is almost completely absent. In the absence of added ADP, the P634L mutant dephosphorylates much more slowly than wild-type, while in the presence of ADP, the rate of dephosphorylation is faster than wild-type. We conclude that the P634L mutation affects conversion between the E<inf>1</inf>P and E<inf>2</inf>P states, such that the mutant E<inf>1</inf> or E preferably <inf>1</inf>P state.",,"Okkeri, J.;Bencomo, E.;Pietila, M.;Haltia, T.",2002,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02810.x,0,0,

2309,Cardiac involvement in Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that leads to pathological accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, and other tissues. One of the reported manifestations is cardiac involvement. METHODS: We studied 42 patients with Wilson's disease (19 males and 23 females, mean age 34 +/- 10 years) and 42 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. All subjects underwent a complete echocardiographic examination; 24-hour ECG Holter monitoring was performed in 23 patients with Wilson's disease. Results: Compared to healthy subjects, patients with Wilson's disease had an increased thickness of the interventricular septum (9.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 8.6 +/- 1.1 mm, p < 0.01) and the left ventricular (LV) posterior wall (9.1 +/- 1.3 versus 8.2 +/- 1.0 mm, p < 0.01). While the two groups did not differ in LV mass index, relative LV wall thickness was significantly increased in patients with Wilson disease compared to controls (0.39 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.34 +/- 0, 04 p<0.001). Nine patients (21%) had concentric LV remodeling and one patient had LV hypertrophy. LV systolic function showed a non-significant trend toward lower values in patients with Wilson's disease (EF 62 +/- 5% vs. 64 +/- 5%, p=0.06).

2310,Pregnancy and congenital metabolic disorders: maternal and fetal complications,"Some inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) can lead to significant complications during pregnancy that affect the mother and/or the fetus. Although only a minority of IMDs appear to have these effects, experience is still being gained. For some diseases, patients have not yet reached childbearing age. Pregnancies in this patient population will increase as management of IMDs in childhood and adolescence improves. Clinicians should be aware of potential complications and carefully consider how best to manage these conditions. Ideally, adult patients should be followed up by a specialized clinical team who can implement a planned approach to conception and pregnancy, but often this is not possible. In conditions where the risk of complications is known (e.g. phenylketonuria), optimal treatment can result in good fetal and maternal outcome. It is important to also consider the possibility of IMD in fetuses from pregnancies affected by non-immune hydrops, maternal HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count), or acute gestational fatty liver.",,"Preece, M.

2311,Dealing with Liver Failure,"Liver disease is rare in childhood, but important recent developments have altered the natural history and outcome. It is important for doctors to be aware of these diseases and their treatment. Acute liver failure is most often due to viral hepatitis, acetaminophen overdose, or inherited metabolic liver disease. The clinical presentation includes jaundice, coagulopathy and encephalopathy. Early diagnosis is necessary to avoid complications such as cerebral edema, gastrointestinal bleeding and renal failure. Early supportive care, particularly intravenous N-acetylcysteine, can be effective, but liver transplantation is usually the definitive treatment, and thus early referral to a liver transplant unit is mandatory. Chronic liver failure may be due to unresolved liver disease in the newborn, either hereditary biliary hypoplasia or extrahepatic biliary atresia, while autoimmune liver disease or cystic fibrosis are the most common causes in older children. Treatment includes specific medications, nutritional support, and liver transplantation, which today has a 90% survival rate with good quality of life.",,"Kelly, D.

2312,Peripheral nociceptin levels in patients with Wilson's disease. [Hungarian],"Plasma levels of nociceptin, the endogenous agonist of the orphaninFQ/OP4 receptor, were significantly increased in patients with Wilson's disease (14.87 +/- 2.44 pg/mL +/- SD, p<0.001, n=21). to age-matched healthy controls (9.18 +/- 1.63 pg/mL +/- SD, n=25). Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene that leads to toxic accumulation of copper mainly in the liver and brain, and other organs such as the kidney and cornea. Measurements were performed by <sup>125</sup>I radioimmunoassay. Neither gender differences nor a correlation between plasma nociceptin levels and liver function test results have been identified in patients with Wilson's disease. It is hypothesized that a significantly elevated plasma nociceptin level is due to the inhibition of nociceptin-inactivating Zn-metallopeptidases (aminopeptidase N, endopeptidase 24.15) by the toxic copper levels, since it is known that the change in the central Zn atom to Cu resulted in approximately 50% inhibition of the activity of these enzymes. The high nociceptin plasma levels in patients with Wilson's disease can lead to a significant impairment of nociceptinerg neurotransmission.",,"Beatrix, H. M.;Kornelia, T.;Ferenc, E. S.",2002,,,0,0,
2313,Reduction of copper and metallothionein in toxic milking mice by tetrathiomolybdate but not by deferiprone,"Copper is both essential to life and toxic. Aberrant regulation of copper at the level of intracellular transport has been linked to inherited diseases, including Wilson's disease (WND) in humans. WND leads to accumulation of copper and the copper and zinc-binding protein metallothionein (MT) in the liver and other tissues, liver degeneration, and neurological dysfunction. The toxic milk (TX) mutation in mice results in a phenotype that mimics human WND, and TX has been proposed as a model for the disease. We have characterized TX mice as a model for altered metal ion and MT levels during development and after treatment with the metal ion chelating agents tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) and deferiprone (L1). We report that copper and MT are elevated in liver, kidney and brain in TX mice aged 3 and 12 months. Zinc was significantly higher in TX mouse liver at both time points, but not in brain and kidney. Nodules appeared spontaneously in livers from 8- to 12-month-old TX mice that retained high copper levels but had more normal morphology and decreased MT levels. Treatment of TX mice with TTM significantly reduced elevated levels of copper and MT in the liver. Transient increases in blood and kidney copper accompanied TTM treatment and suggested that renal excretion was an important clearance route. L1 treatment, on the other hand, had no effect on liver or kidney copper and MT, but did result in increased levels of copper and MT in the brain. These data indicate that TTM, but not L1, may be useful in treating copper overload diseases, including WND. © 2002 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Czachor, J. D.;Cherian, M.

2315,Roles of metallothionein in copper homeostasis: responses to Cu-deficient diets in mice,"Metallothionein (MT) protects the body from both harmful non-essential and excess essential metals. Copper (Cu) is an essential metal and its concentration in the body is regulated at a constant level between excess and deficiency. Cu that accumulates in the livers of patients with Wilson's disease and its animal model, Long Evans cinnamon-like coat color (LEC) rats, is in the form of Cu,Zn-MT, where MT is an antioxidant. In contrast to the efficient production of MT in response to excessive accumulation of Cu in LEC rats, Cu binding to MT occurs only marginally under normal conditions. However, the present study showed that Cu binds more strongly to MT in severe Cu deficiency. Namely, C57BL/6J male mice were fed a Cu-deficient diet (0.037 mg Cu/g) and deionized water containing trientine, and then the concentration and distribution of Cu were determined. It has been suggested that cessation of biliary excretion and limitation of Cu supply by ceruloplasmin are the initial responses to feeding a Cu-deficient diet, followed by an increase in Cu-MT with maintenance of hepatic Cu concentration. These results suggest that MT causes Cu recruitment in a Cu-deficient environment by sequestering Cu from degraded Cu enzymes and donating it to Cu chaperones. © 2002 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Suzuki, K.

2317,Cancer therapy with tetrathiomolybdate: antiangiogenesis by lowering body copper - a review,"new anti-copper drug, tetrathiomolybdate(TM), developed for Wilson's disease is a very promising anti-angiogenic agent. Copper levels reduced by TM into an antiangiogenic window have shown anticancer efficacy in a variety of animal models as well as in patients. The only significant toxicity to date results from overtreatment and excessive depletion of copper in the bone marrow. The resulting anemia and/or leukopenia is easily treatable by dose reduction or drug cessation. The underlying concept for TM's effectiveness as an anti-cancer agent is that when the body's copper status is in the window, cellular copper needs are met and toxicity avoided. Copper status is relatively easy to monitor by monitoring serum ceruloplasmin, a copper-containing protein that is cleared by the liver at a rate that depends on the amount of copper in the liver that is available for incorporation into the protein. The authors speculate that the copper level is a primitive angiogenesis and growth signaling regulator that has been conserved throughout evolution.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Merajver, S.

Rats receiving 80 mg zinc acetate daily by gavage and control rats receiving no treatment were sacrificed after 1 or 2 weeks. By immunohistochemical and analytical chemical techniques, we showed that treated rats had higher levels of MT in liver and kidney cells compared to untreated rats. Tissue Zn concentrations were significantly higher in treated rats than in untreated rats, while liver and kidney Cu concentrations decreased as shown by analytical chemical analyses. MT levels also decreased with the duration of treatment. A histochemical procedure obtained using autofluorescence of Cu-metallothioneins confirms these results: after 2 weeks the signal decreased in both liver and kidney sections. This allows for a better understanding of the mechanism of Cu metabolism in the two tissues considered. These results suggest that Zn both competes for absorption on the luminal side of the intestinal epithelium and induces the synthesis of MT.",,"Santon, A.;Giannetto, S.;Sturniolo, G.;Medici, V.;D'Inca, R.;Irato, P.;Albergoni, V.",2002,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00418-002-0380-8,0,0,

We report on two patients with Wilson's disease and ALF treated with the Molecular Adsorbents Recirculating System (MARS). Both patients met criteria for poor prognosis. Since LTx was not immediately available in either case, MARS was used as a bridge to LTx. In case 1, serum bilirubin fell from 803 to 425 µmol/l after 3 treatments, but rose to 656 µmol/l during a pause and fell to 457 µmol/l with further treatment. Serum copper decreased from 53.7 µmol/L to 35.8 µmol/L after the first treatment session and to 17.4 µmol/L at the end of treatment. In case 2, MARS treatment for 2 weeks reduced serum bilirubin from 1200 to 450 µmol/L and copper from 35 to 13 µmol/L with a marked improvement in encephalopathy and a reduction in ammonia (59 to 34 µmol/L). Both patients were successfully bridged to LTx (Days 9 and 28, respectively). Analysis of the albumin dialysate from the MARS circuit indicated that copper removal occurred mainly in the first hours of treatment, being partially adsorbed by albumin and partially by the MARSFlux membrane (Teraklin AG, Rostock, Germany). These data suggest that MARS can efficiently remove copper and be used to bridge patients with Wilson's disease and ALF LTx.",,"Sen, S.;Felldin, M.;Steiner, C.;Larsson, B.;Gillett, G.

2324,Metallothionein und antioxidative Enzyme bei mit Zink behandelten Long-Evans-Zimtratten,"The Long-Evans cinnamon (LEC) rat is a mutant animal model of Wilson's disease. It is known that abnormal accumulation of Cu and Fe in the liver and low concentrations of both ceruloplasmin and Cu in the serum occur in these rats. The accumulation of Cu is explained by the defective expression of the Cu-transporting P-type ATPase gene, which is homologous to the gene for Wilson's disease (ATP7B). The aim of this work was to elucidate the mechanism of action of Zn and to verify the role played by this metal in LEC rats in short-term treatment experiments (1 and 2 weeks) to concentrations of Cu, Zn, Fe, metallothionein (MT), 8-hydroxy- 2'-deoxyguanosine (oh<sup>8</sup>dG) and on the activity of antioxidant enzymes. It is well known that Zn induces MT and has the ability to prevent redox-active metals, Cu and Fe, from binding to active sites of Zn metalloenzymes and non-specific binding sites on proteins and causing oxidative damage. Zn administration reduces the Cu and Fe transport from the mucosal to the serous side of the intestine through competitive mechanisms. Our results show that zinc acetate treatment increases tissue Zn and MT and decreases hepatic and renal Cu and Fe concentrations, even though hepatic Zn and MT concentrations decrease with treatment duration. The induction of MT synthesis by Zn contributes to the reduction of free radicals generated by Cu and Fe. We have also observed that hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreases with treatment duration associated with the decrease in hepatic Cu and Fe. However, kidney SOD activity increases in untreated rats after 2 weeks compared to those untreated for 1 week.",,"Medici, V.;Santon, A.;Sturniolo, G.;D'Inca, R.;Giannetto, S.;Albergoni, V.;Irato, P.",2002,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00204-002-0377-z,0,0,

METHODS: Iron indices (ferritin, transferrin saturation [TS], serum iron), liver parameters, the prevalence and significance of C282Y and H63D HFE mutations were assessed in 40 unrelated Caucasian Wilson's disease patients and 295 healthy controls. Because of the specific treatment, Wilson's disease was well controlled in all but one patient. Results: The allele frequencies for the C282Y (11.3% vs. 6.2%) and the H63D mutation (18.8% vs. 16.4%) did not differ between patients with Wilson's disease and healthy controls. One patient with C282Y homozygous HH and Wilson's disease was identified who presented with progressive liver disease despite appropriate bloodletting and copper chelation therapy.

One of the most interesting and recent aspects regarding the putative role of zinc deficiency in the development of clinical features of liver cirrhosis is the possible relationship between zinc and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Long-term zinc supplementation in patients with HE improves neurological symptoms and metabolic parameters. In Wilson's disease, a hereditary copper defect in the liver, zinc is used for maintenance and treatment in pre-symptomatic, pregnant and pediatric patients.

2334,Wilson's disease,"Sir Alexander Kinnear Wilson made the original description of a syndrome of hepatolenticular degeneration almost a century ago, correctly positing an association between the observed liver cirrhosis and the neurological signs and symptoms. However, copper was not known as an etiopathological agent at the time. Although the genetic basis of this disease is now clear, our understanding of its pathogenesis is still evolving. Wilson disease (WD), as the syndrome was later called, is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the adenosine triphosphatase 7B (ATP7B) gene on chromosome 13. This gene encodes a copper transporter in hepatocytes that is critical for the hepatic excretion of excess copper into the bile. Although WD is a relatively rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism, occurring in approximately 1 in 30,000 people, it is often considered in the differential diagnosis of patients under 45 years of age with fulminant hepatic failure or unexplained liver disease, or in patients with neurological or psychiatric symptoms and liver disease. If WD is recognized and treated appropriately, disease progression is prevented and copper-induced damage may be reversed. Specific clinical and biochemical findings used to establish the diagnosis include serum ceruloplasmin, serum and urine copper, corneal Kayser-Fleischer rings and hepatic histology, histochemistry, and copper levels. The identification of the gene has enabled testing with haplotype analysis for siblings of identified patients and direct mutational analysis for de novo diagnosis within specific populations with dominant mutations. Treatment is lifelong drug therapy with chelating agents or zinc to remove copper or prevent its absorption, or liver transplantation, which cures the metabolic defect.",,"Schilsky, M.

Wilson disease is a relatively rare, autosomal recessive copper transport disorder resulting from toxic accumulation of copper in the liver and brain. In patients with Wilson's disease, both the incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin and the excretion of this metal in the bile are impaired. These conditions are caused by a genetic defect in the Wilson disease gene (ATP7B) mapped to chromosome 13. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings, results of important laboratory tests such as low serum ceruloplasmin levels, increased urinary copper excretion and liver copper content, and the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings. An emerging method of diagnosis is the use of molecular techniques. Several treatments are available to increase urinary excretion and decrease intestinal absorption of copper.

2340,Molecular diagnosis of Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. Diagnosis is based on clinical and biochemical criteria, which are increasingly considered to be of low sensitivity. Genetic diagnosis is considered impractical due to the large coding region of the ATP7B gene and extreme mutational diversity. We evaluated the feasibility and usefulness of genetic diagnosis in WD. The coding region of the ATP7B gene was scanned by single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis in 6 cases in which the diagnosis of WD was uncertain. In addition, we attempted a molecular diagnosis in 26 WM patients of similar ethnicity but different disease manifestations. In 6 individuals for whom the biochemical/clinical diagnosis was uncertain, DNA analysis was useful to assign their status with respect to WM. Molecular diagnosis identified pre-symptomatic individuals in families affected by WD and reassigned individuals previously diagnosed as affected to heterozygous carrier or wild-type status. In 26 WD patients, 92% of the disease alleles were identified. The most common mutations were H1069Q, L936X, and 2532delA, representing 48%, 10%, and 8% of disease alleles, respectively. Three new mutations were identified: Q898R, 3061(-1)g -> a and 3972insC. A genetic diagnosis is possible for WD.

2346,Excitement and inhibition mechanisms in Wilson's disease: study with magnetic motor cortex stimulation,"We assessed cortical excitability in nine Wilson's disease (WD) patients using transcranial magnetic (TMS) and electrical (TES) cortical stimulation and central silent period (CSP) data. A clinical score was derived from the sum of scores assigned to the extrapyramidal, pyramidal, and cerebellar signs. All patients underwent TMS. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were recorded. MEP threshold and amplitude, central motor conduction time (CMCT), CSP threshold, CSP, and peripheral silent period (PSP) duration were measured. Three patients also underwent transcranial bifocal electrical cortical stimulation (TES) and MEPs were recorded from the APB muscle and CMCT, MEP threshold and amplitude were measured. TMS MPs were absent in six patients with relaxed muscles and three with contracted muscles. CMCT was prolonged in six patients. APB CMCT correlated with clinical score. In three patients in whom TMS showed abnormal or no MEPs, TES MEPs had normal threshold and amplitude. The CSP threshold was elevated in seven patients and CSP was absent in one. These results suggest an intracortical presynaptic motor dysfunction in WD. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science BV",,"Perretti, A.;Pellecchia, M.

[French],"Introduction. - The liver and central nervous system are common targets of Wilson's disease, an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Severe hemolytic anemia is an uncommon complication of Wilson's disease. Exegesis. - We report two cases of Wilson's disease revealed by acute intravascular hemolytic anemia associated with Fiver failure. Blood smear analysis showed stippled red blood cells in one case; In both patients, the hemolytic anemia improved within a few weeks, in the other, progressive Fiver's failure required a transplant. The hemolysis probably results from the toxic effect of free serum copper on the erythrocyte membrane.

2350,Acute worsening of symptoms in a patient with Wilson's disease following penicillamine therapy. [German],"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in abnormal accumulation of copper in the liver, CNS, cornea, and other organs. It is characterized by neurological symptoms, psychiatric abnormalities, liver disease, and a host of other symptoms. Patients should be treated at an early stage of the disease to reduce pathological copper accumulation and prevent chronic organ damage. However, a very rapid ""decoppering"" with penicillamine can lead to a worsening of the symptoms, which then requires an adjustment of the therapy. We present the case of a patient with WM who experienced marked worsening of neurological and psychiatric findings after initiating treatment with penicillamine. The therapy had to be changed after one month. With reference to this case report, we review the relevant literature on the clinical picture of WM and the problem of penicillamine intolerance.",,"Bosebeck, F.",2001,,,0,0,

Average copper intake was 944 cups/day, urinary copper excretion was 503 cups/day, stool copper excretion was 922 cups/day; Therefore, trientine reduces body copper by about 500 cups a day.

2352,The copper chelator trientine suppresses tumor development and angiogenesis in mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cells,"Angiogenesis is now recognized as a critical process in tumor development, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Since HCC is known as a hypervascular tumor, anti-angiogenesis is a promising approach to inhibit HCC development. Trientine dihydrochloride (Trientine) is used in clinical practice as an alternative copper (Cu) chelating agent for patients with Wilson's disease or penicillamine intolerance. In our study, we examined the effect of Cu chelating agents on tumor development and angiogenesis in the murine HCC xenograft model. Although both trientine and penicillamine in drinking water suppressed tumor development, trientine exerted a more potent inhibitory effect than penicillamine. When combined with a low-Cu diet, both trientine and penicillamine nearly prevented HCC development. Treatment with trientine led to a significant suppression of neovascularization and an increase in apoptosis in the tumor, while tumor cell proliferation itself was not altered. In vitro studies also showed that trientine is not cytotoxic to tumor cells. On the other hand, it significantly suppressed endothelial cell proliferation. These results suggested that Cu plays a central role in tumor development and angiogenesis in the murine HCC cells and Cu chelators, particularly trientine, could inhibit angiogenesis and enhance tumor apoptosis, with consequent suppression of tumor growth in vivo . Since trientine is already being used in clinical practice without serious side effects compared to penicillamine, it could be a powerful new strategy for future HCC therapy. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Yoshii, J.;Yoshiji, H.;Kuriyama, S.;Ikenaka, Y.;Noguchi, R.;Okuda, H.;Tsujinoue, H.;Nakatani, T.;Kishida, H.;Nakae, D.;Gomez, D.

2354,"Copper in diseases with neurological symptoms: Alzheimer's, Menkes and Wilson's disease","Copper is an essential element for the activity of a number of physiologically important enzymes. Enzyme-related malfunctions can contribute to severe neurological symptoms and neurological disorders: Copper is a component of cytochrome c oxidase, which catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water, the essential step in cellular respiration. Copper is a cofactor of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, which plays a key role in the cellular response to oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species. In addition, copper is a component of dopamine beta-hydroxylase, a crucial enzyme in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway. A detailed exploration of the biological significance and functional properties of proteins associated with neurological symptoms will have an important impact on the understanding of disease mechanisms and can accelerate the development and testing of new therapeutic approaches. Copper-binding proteins play an important role in establishing and maintaining metal ion homeostasis, in deficiency diseases with neurological symptoms (Menkes' disease, Wilson's disease) and in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease). The Menkes and Wilson proteins have been characterized as copper transporters, and it has been suggested that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) of Alzheimer's disease acts as a Cu(II) and/or Zn(II) transporter. Experimental, clinical and epidemiological observations in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and in the genetically inherited copper-dependent diseases Menkes and Wilson's disease are summarized. This could provide a rationale for a link between severely dysregulated metal ion homeostasis and selective neuronal pathology. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",,"Strausak, D.;Mercer, J. F.

2357,Mitochondria and degenerative diseases,"In mammalian cells, mitochondria provide energy from aerobic metabolism. They play an important regulatory role in apoptosis, produce and detoxify free radicals, and serve as a cellular calcium buffer. Neurodegenerative diseases involving mitochondria can be divided into those characterized by oxidative phosphorylation abnormalities (OXPHOS) either due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) abnormalities, e.g. B. chronic external ophthalmoplegia, or due to nuclear mutations of OXPHOS proteins, z. B. Complex I and II, are caused Leigh syndrome. There are diseases caused by nuclear genes encoding non-OXPHOS mitochondrial proteins, such as frataxin in Friedreich's ataxia (which probably plays an important role in mitochondrial and cytosolic iron cycling), paraplegin (possibly a mitochondrial ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease des AAA ATPases in hereditary spastic paraparesis) and possibly Wilson's disease protein (an abnormal copper-transporting ATP-dependent P-type ATPase associated with Wilson's disease). Huntingon's disease is an example of diseases with OXPHOS defects associated with mutations in nuclear genes that encode non-mitochondrial proteins such as huntingtin. There are also diseases with evidence of unassigned mitochondrial involvement. These include Parkinson's disease (in which a complex I defect is described and free radicals are generated from dopamine metabolism), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease, in which there is evidence that one mitochondrial involvement may be secondary to others anomalies is. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Orth, M.;Schapira, A.

Wilson's disease was diagnosed. After the ARDS resolved, the patient underwent a successful orthotopic liver transplant. Diagnostic combinations for Wilson's disease are ceruloplasmin < 0.2 g/l with Kayser-Fleischer rings, liver copper > 250 µg/g (dry weight) with Kayser-Fleischer rings, or homozygosity for a Wilson mutation on the 13th chromosome. In acute liver failure, a 24-hour urinary copper excretion of more than 1 mg is diagnostic for Wilson's disease, while an increased serum copper concentration makes this diagnosis very probable. Therapeutic options for Wilson's disease include chelation therapy and liver transplantation; in most cases of acute liver failure due to Wilson's disease, orthotopic liver transplantation (with previous albumin dialysis) is indicated.

Nevertheless, many biochemical or clinical studies show a high clinical relevance of trace elements, especially zinc, in therapeutic concepts of diseases. Unfortunately, the boundary between severe (or true) and mild (or subclinical) zinc deficiency is not clearly defined. In addition, methodological problems in the determination of trace elements and misinterpretation of study results lead to an unjustified assignment of several diseases to the group of zinc deficiency diseases. Another current problem is the consideration of the bioavailability of oral commercial trace element preparations. In particular, the regulation of zinc intake in humans under normal conditions and in the case of zinc deficiency is not clear at this time. These problems have bogged down the current literature for the zinc clinician. This mini-review provides an overview of published clinical trials of oral zinc supplementation over the past several years.",,"Hocke, M.;Winnefeld, K.;Bosseckert, H.",2001,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-2001-10709,0,0,
2362,The effects of penicillamine and zinc in liver and brain tissues of copper-overloaded rats,"Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of penicillamine and zinc sulfate in copper-exposed rats and to compare copper reduction in liver and brain tissue. Materials and Methods: 35 male albino Wistar rats were divided equally into 5 groups. The control group (G1) received normal tap water, while the 4 groups (G2, 3, 4, 5) were supplied with water containing copper. After 5 weeks, rats in G1 and G2 were sacrificed. The remaining rats (G3, 4, 5) received normal chow for the following 4 weeks. During this time, the fourth group (G4) received zinc sulfate (6.5 mg/kg) and the fifth group (G5) penicillamine (20 mg/kg). The third group (G3) was left untreated. Results: The amounts of copper deposited in the liver tissue of G2 were significantly higher than that of G1 (p=0.008). In G3, brain copper levels were significantly higher than in G1 and G2 (p<0.001 and 0.01, respectively), while hepatic concentrations were not statistically different. Rats in G5 had significantly lower liver and brain copper levels than G3 (p=0.023 and <0.001, respectively). There was a significant reduction in brain copper levels in G4 compared to G3 (p=0.003). Conclusion: The reduction in copper levels in both liver and brain tissue by penicillamine in copper-overloaded rats suggests that mechanisms other than the brain redistribution effect may be responsible for the neurological deterioration induced by penicillamine treatment in patients with WD. In addition, zinc may have an early effect in preventing excess copper deposition, likely by inducing hepatic metallothionine synthesis. In summary, zinc can be used in conjunction with chelating agents for initial control of patients with neurological symptoms.",,"Ozcelik, D.;Eralp, Y.;Oztekin, G.;Dursun, S.;Uzunismail, H.",2001,,,0,0,

Ag, Cu and Zn levels increased in kidney and liver after Ag injection. In particular, the Cu content in the kidneys increased dramatically after three Ag injections. Sephadex G-75 elution profiles of renal cytosol from Ag-injected rats showed that the accumulated Cu in the kidney was bound to MT, as were Ag and Zn. In addition, the localization of Cu and Ag MT in the kidney was examined using autofluorescence signals dependent on Cu or Ag thiol clusters and immunohistochemistry. Although Ag-induced MT was predominantly observed in the renal cortex, some MT signals were also observed in the outer stripe of the outer medulla as well as in the kidneys of LEC rats, an animal model of Wilson's disease (an inherited disorder of Cu metabolism). In these LEC rats, Cu-MT also accumulated in the outer stripe of the outer medulla. From these results, a possibility could be explained that the Cu-MT detected in the outer stripe of the outer medulla in the kidney of an Ag-injected rat was associated with the Ag-affected Cu transporter.

[Japanese],"We report a young adult female case of Wilson's disease presenting with psychiatric disturbances and frontal lobe signs. The patient was admitted to our neurological department on October 4, 1999 because of schizophrenia-like symptoms, dysphagia, dysarthria and gait disturbance. She presented with slowly progressive stiffness and dystonia. Her parents were second cousins. Neurological examination revealed bilateral pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, frontal lobe signs (including imitation behavior). Tendon reflexes were slightly exaggerated in all extremities. Bilateral Babinski, Chaddock and Hoffmann signs were positive. Her verbal IQ on the revised Wechsler adult intelligence scale was 49. Biochemical testing revealed low plasma concentrations of copper and ceruloplasmin. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal. Cranial MRI showed diffuse brain atrophy and enlargement of the lateral ventricles. MRI T2-weighted images showed a hyperintense signal in both the thalamus and basal ganglia. SPECT showed hypoperfusion in the left frontal lobe, both in the thalamus and in the basal ganglia. The EEG showed a diffuse 2q wave. A diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made and treatment with D-penicillamine 900 mg per day was started. This hypoperfusion of the SPECT and EEG findings improved after 2 months of D-penicillamine therapy. Neurological findings showed slight improvement.

2370,Visual pathway abnormalities in Wilson disease an electrophysiological study using electroretinography and visual evoked potentials,"The pathogenesis of the visual evoked potential abnormalities (PRVEP) in patients with Wilson's disease has not been investigated to date. Because electroretinography (ERG) assesses the functional integrity of the retina, it has been used in conjunction with PRVEP to locate the abnormalities in PRVEP in Wilson patients. Ten patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease underwent PRVEP and flash ERG shortly after diagnosis. PRVEP latencies were prolonged compared to controls (P<0.001). Photopic and scotopic A-waves and oscillatory potentials were prolonged (P<0.02) with a reduction in photopic A- and B-wave amplitudes (P<0.001). Six of these patients underwent repeat PRVEP and flash ERG after clinical improvement with specific therapy. Comparison of visual electrophysiology studies before and after treatment revealed a significant reduction in PRVEP and flash ERG A-wave latencies (P<0.05) with increases in amplitudes of P100 of PRVEP (P<0.05), A - and B-waves of lightning ERG (P<0.01). These findings confirm the reported PRVEP changes in WD and additionally demonstrate the reversibility of the retinal dysfunction that partially contributes to the PRVEP abnormalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ERG study in patients with Wilson's disease in the literature. Furthermore, there were no previous reports in the literature evaluating the effect of a specific treatment on PRVEP and ERG in Wilson's disease.

2371,Comparative efficacy of several potential treatments for copper mobilization in copper-overloaded rats,"D-penicillamine (DPA) is effective in treating Wilson's disease, while zinc salts are also used as therapy for this copper transport disorder. Recently, the copper chelators 1,4,7,11-tetraazaundecanetetrahydrochloride (TAUD) and tetraethylenepentaminepentahydrochloride (TETREN) were shown to be useful for copper mobilization in rats. Since these agents could be potential clinical alternatives to DPA for patients with Wilson's disease who are intolerant to this drug, we investigated whether oral administration of TAUD and TETREN could induce copper mobilization in copper-overloaded rats. The effectiveness of a combined administration of zinc and DPA, TAUD or TETREN was also evaluated. Rats were copper loaded with 0.125% copper acetate in water for 12 weeks. After this period, DPA, TAUD and TETREN were administered by gavage at 0.67 mmol/kg/day for 5 days and zinc at 2.5 mg Zn/kg/day. Twelve weeks of copper intake resulted in a 32-fold increase in total hepatic copper. TETREN was the most effective chelating agent in increasing urinary copper excretion. However, it did not significantly reduce hepatic copper levels. The combined administration of zinc and chelating agents, in turn, significantly reduced the amount of copper found in the faeces. Although TAUD and TETREN showed similar or greater efficacy than DPA in mobilizing copper, current results suggest that concomitant treatment with chelating agents and zinc salts should be discarded.",,"Domingo, J.

For the most part, these dilemmas have not been resolved by the identification and cloning of the Wilson disease gene. Objectives - Reports on our three decades of experience with patients with Wilson's disease to illustrate the varied patterns of presentation and thereby broaden the diagnostic approach. METHODS - Clinical and laboratory findings from 30 patients with Wilson's disease were reviewed. Results - Twenty-two patients with hepatic manifestations (eight with fulminant hepatic failure and 14 with chronic liver disease), three with neurological disease and one with hemolysis; four were asymptomatic siblings of patients with Wilson's disease. Seventy percent were diagnosed within six months of symptom onset, but diagnosis was delayed by up to nine years. The age range at diagnosis was wide (7-58 years) and five patients were over 40 years old. Of the patients with non-fulminant disease, 18% had neither Kayser-Fleischer rings nor low ceruloplasmin concentrations. Elevated levels of copper in the liver were found in all but one patient who had undergone six years of penicillamine treatment. In fulminant hepatic failure (n = 8), additional features helpful in diagnosis were evidence of hemolysis, elevated urinary copper (range 844–9375 μg/24 h), and high non-caeruloplasmin copper (range 325–1743 μg/l). . Conclusions - The diagnosis of Wilson's disease still depends primarily on the evaluation of clinical and laboratory evidence of abnormal copper metabolism. No feature is reliable, but the diagnosis can usually be made if there is any suspicion.

2376,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. XVII: Treatment during pregnancy,"The treatment of Wilson's disease is evolving. In 1997, zinc acetate was added to the Food and Drug Administration's list of approved drugs, which includes penicillamine and trientine. The mechanism of zinc's anticopper action is unique. It induces metallothionein in the intestinal cells, which binds copper and prevents its transfer into the blood. When intestinal cells die and detach, the copper they contain is excreted in the stool. Zinc prevents the intestinal absorption of copper. It is generally accepted that pregnant Wilson's disease patients should receive anticopper therapy during pregnancy. There are numerous reports of such patients who discontinued penicillamine therapy to protect their fetus from teratogenicity, only to experience serious deterioration and even death from recurrent copper toxicity. Penicillamine and trientine have teratogenic effects in animals, and penicillamine has known teratogenic effects in humans. In this report, we discuss the results of 26 pregnancies in 19 women who received zinc therapy throughout their pregnancy. Evidence is good that zinc protects maternal health during pregnancy.

2380,Oxidative phosphorylation defects in the liver of patients with Wilson's disease,"Background. Wilson disease (WD) is caused by mutations in a P-type ATPase and is associated with copper deposition in the liver and brain. The WD protein is present in the trans-Golgi network and can also be imported into mitochondria. The WD protein functions as a P-type copper transport ATPase in the Golgi, but an effect in mitochondria is currently unknown. methods. We examined mitochondrial function and aconitase activity in MV liver tissue and compared the results to a panel of healthy controls and patients without MV. Results. There was evidence of severe mitochondrial dysfunction in the livers of patients with WD. The enzyme activities were reduced as follows: complex I by 62%, complex II + III by 52%, complex IV by 33% and aconitase by 71%. These defects did not appear to be secondary to penicillamine use, cholestasis, or poor hepatocellular synthetic function. Interpretation. The results show that there is a defect in energy metabolism in MW. The pattern of enzyme defects suggests that free radical formation and oxidative damage, likely mediated via mitochondrial copper accumulation, are important in the pathogenesis of WD. These results provide rationale for a study on the use of antioxidants in WD.",,"Gu, M.;Cooper, J. M.;Butler, P.;Walker, A. P.;Mistry, P. K.;Dooley, J. S.;Schapira, A. H.

2383,Wilson's disease revisited. [Serbian],"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an inability of the liver to excrete copper in the bile and to incorporate copper into ceruloplasmin. The gradual accumulation of copper in various tissues causes organ dysfunction, so untreated disease is invariably fatal. Because the manifestations of Wilson's disease are complex and the disease masks something else so well, recognizing the possibility of Wilson's disease is a major problem that leads to serious underdiagnosis of the disease. The longer detection and diagnosis are delayed, the greater the risk of permanent damage, primarily to the liver and/or brain. The availability of effective therapy and the risk of delaying therapy make early diagnosis crucial. Current therapies include chelating agents, which increase urinary excretion of copper, and tetrathiomolybdate, which forms complexes with copper and blocks copper absorption from the gut or renders copper nontoxic in the blood. Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for liver failure. The diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms are discussed.",,"Vucelic, B.",2000,,,0,0,
2384,Zinc as a first-line treatment for Wilson's disease in children. [Serbian],"Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited copper accumulation disease caused by a failure of the biliary excretion of excess copper. Accumulated copper causes tissue damage. The chelating agents penicillamine and trientine have been the mainstay of therapy, and most patients with WM have been treated with the potentially toxic cupriuretics. A more recent approach has used zinc, which blocks the absorption of copper and increases faecal copper excretion, and long-term administration induces negative copper balance. Until recently, most patients were initially treated with cupriuretics to remove excess copper and then maintained with oral zinc. Recently, zinc has also been used for initial treatment and for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients. To date, zinc therapy has shown exceptional efficacy and a lack of toxicity. In this article, we present our long-term follow-up data for three children with WM whose initial and subsequent treatment was zinc sulfate. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of zinc therapy in the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients and in the initial treatment of symptomatic children with WM. Our data also indicate low toxicity. However, pediatric patients must be closely monitored as they tend to discontinue treatment when they become asymptomatic.",,"Cacic, M.;Percl, M.;Jadresin, O.;Kolacek, S.",2000,,,0,0,
2385,Novel mutations of the ATP7B gene in Japanese patients with Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation in the liver, brain, kidneys, and cornea, culminating in copper toxicity in these organs. In this study we analyzed mutations of the responsible gene ATP7B in four Japanese patients with MV. By direct sequencing we identified five mutations, two of which were novel, and 16 polymorphisms, 6 of which were novel. The mutations 2871delC and 2513delA shift the reading frame so that truncated abnormal protein is to be expected. In contrast to these mutations found in patients with early onset of the hepatic type, mutations A874V, R778L and 3892delGTC were either missense mutations or inframe 1 amino acid deletion and occurred in patients with late onset of the hepato-neurological type. The 2871delC and R778L mutations have previously been reported in a relatively large number of Japanese patients. In particular, R778L is known to be more common in Asian countries than other countries in the world. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the mutations are more population-specific. Therefore, accumulation of mutation types in Japanese patients with WD will facilitate rapid and effective genetic diagnosis of WD in Japanese patients.",,"Kusuda, Y.;Hamaguchi, K.;Mori, T.;Shin, R.;Seike, M.;Sakata, T.",2000,,,0,0,
2386,Biological regulation of copper and selective removal of copper: therapy of Wilson's disease and its molecular mechanism. [Japanese],"Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element and forms the active site of redox Cu enzymes such as Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn-SOD), ceruloplasmin and cytochrome c oxidase. Among the hereditary diseases due to a defect in Cu metabolism, it has been shown that Menkes disease (caused by a Cu deficiency) and Wilson's disease (caused by the excessive accumulation of Cu) are caused by the mutation of genes encoding the Cu binding encode ATPase for the efflux of Cu, ATP7A and ATP7B, respectively. Following the identification of these causative genes, intracellular Cu transporters (Cu chaperones) specific to the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria and Cu,Zn-SOD were discovered and these findings have prompted the study of the underlying mechanisms of the biological regulation of Cu relieved. Apart from these physiological and biochemical studies, toxicological studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms of the occurrence of acute hepatitis caused by the accumulation of Cu accumulated in the liver of an animal model of Wilson's disease, LEC rats. In these toxicological studies, two biological aspects of metallothionein (MT) were proposed, ie antioxidant and pro-oxidant depending on the Cu/Zn ratio in Cu-containing MT. This article provides an overview of the most recent findings on the biological regulation of Cu and the toxicological aspect of Cu. It is known that Cu forms a stable ternary complex with molybdenum and sulfur under reductive conditions in the body. Based on this observation, tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) was applied to remove Cu from the liver of Long Evans rats with a cinnamon-like coat color (LEC). Precise mechanisms underlying the complex formation between MT-bound Cu and TTM have been presented, and a suitable protocol for chelation therapy has been proposed along with the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of side effects.",,"Suzuki, K.

Nanomolar concentrations of Cu<sup>2+</sup> induce a slowly reversible block of GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents, which can be removed by chelating agents. 2. The potential interaction of Cu<sup>2+</sup> with the Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site on the GABA(A) receptor complex was investigated in acutely isolated Purkinje cells using whole-cell recording and a Rapid drug delivery system. 3. When Zn<sup>2+</sup> was co-applied with 2 muM GABA, the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-induced block of GABA-mediated currents was not additive to Cu<sup>2+ </sup>-induced block. In the presence of 0.1 mM Cu<sup>2+</sup> in the bathing solution, the degree of inhibition of GABA-mediated reactions by Zn<sup>2+</sup> was greatly attenuated. 4. Pre-application of 100 µM Zn<sup>2+</sup> for 10 s, terminated 1 s before exposure to 2 µM GABA, affected the GABA current in Cu<sup>2+</sup>-free Solution does not, but relieves its blockage by 0.1 muM Cu<sup>2+</sup>.

When the Cu<sup>2+</sup>-induced blockage was removed by histidine, prior application of Zn<sup>2+</sup> did not increase GABA current, indicating that the palliation of Cu<sup> 2+</sup> blockage by Zn<sup>2+</sup> is the result of its ability to actively clear Cu<sup>2+</sup> from the GABA receptor complex. 6. It is proposed that the inhibitory effects of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> on GABA-induced currents result from an action of these metal ions at different but conformationally linked sites Sites on the GABA(A) receptor protein. Under physiological conditions, Zn<sup>2+</sup> would release Cu<sup>2+</sup> from the GABA(A) receptor and thus Cu<sup>2+</sup> turnover and binding facilitate other endogenous chelating molecules.",,"Sharonova, I.

2390,Metabolic fate of the insoluble copper/tetrathiomolybdate complex formed in the liver of LEC rats with excess tetrathiomolybdate,"Copper (Cu), bound to metallothionein (MT), accumulates in the liver of cinnamon-coated Long Evans (LEC) rats, an animal model of Wilson's disease, can be removed from the MT with tetrathiomolybdate (TTM). However, it is known that the insoluble Cu/TTM complex formed with excess TTM is deposited in the liver. The metabolic fate of the insoluble Cu/TTM complex was investigated in the present study. LEC rats were injected with TTM at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight for 8 consecutive days and fed a standard or Cu-depleted diet for 14 days after the last injection. About 95% of the Cu in the liver became insoluble along with Mo. The Cu concentration in the liver supernatants of rats fed the standard diet increased significantly compared to the rats dissected 24 h after the last injection (control rats), while the concentration in rats fed the low Cu diet remained at levels comparable to controls. The rate of Cu accumulation in the livers of rats fed the standard diet did not differ before and after treatment, indicating that there was no rebound effect from TTM treatment. These results suggest that the insoluble Cu/TTM complex is resolubilized in the liver and that the solubilized complex is excreted in the bile and blood, ie the insoluble Cu/TTM complex is not the source of Cu reaccumulation in bound Shape to MT in the liver after TTM treatment. It was concluded that once Cu is complexed with TTM, the metal is excreted into bile and blood either immediately in the soluble form or slowly in the insoluble form.

We examined the ATP7B gene in two Japanese sisters with Wilson's disease who had fulminant liver failure but had no Kayser-Fleischer rings or abnormal neurological findings. Genomic DNA was isolated from the whole blood of the patients and their families. Whole exons of ATP7B and their associated splice sites were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Sequencing of all exons was performed by a non-radioactive sequencing method. Sequencing of exon 12 of ATP7B revealed a 9 bp deletion. The mutation deleted 922Gly, 923Tyr and 924Phe and three residues conserved in the Menkes gene, ATP7A, located in the fifth transmembrane region. Of the 14 family members tested, 7 were normal and 7 were heterozygous for the deletion. Mean serum copper and cerulopasmin levels were significantly lower in family members heterozygous for the deletion than in normal family members, and two heterozygous family members had abnormally low levels of cerulopasmin; however, there were no differences in mean aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels between the two groups.",,"Okada, T.;Morise, T.;Takeda, Y.;Mabuchi, H.",2000,April,,0,0,

2398,Dissolution of copper-rich granules in hepatic lysosomes by D-penicillamine prevents the development of fulminant hepatitis in Long Evans cinnamon rats,"Background/Objective: The Long Evans cinnamon rat has a mutation homologous to the human Wilson disease gene that leads to extensive copper accumulation and the development of hepatitis. D-penicillamine, a copper-chelating drug that is widely and effectively used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, has also been shown to prevent hepatitis in Long Evans cinnamon rats. The objectives of this study were: i) to investigate the efficacy of D-penicillamine when administered to already diseased animals and ii) to elucidate the mechanism of action of the drug. Methods: Long Evans cinnamon rats were divided into groups according to age and treatment with D-penicillamine. The drug was administered orally before and after the onset of hepatitis. Livers were examined by light and electron microscopy. The effect of D-penicillamine on the subcellular distribution and binding of copper was examined in more detail. Finally, the interaction between D-penicillamine and specific hepatic copper-binding proteins was investigated in vitro. Results: D-penicillamine, when administered to either healthy or diseased animals, prevented or reversed hepatitis, respectively. In particular, the drug inhibited the disease-specific accumulation of copper in lysosomes of hepatocytes, tissue macrophages and Kupffer cells. When administered to diseased animals, the drug sequestered copper particularly from insoluble lysosomal particles. According to the results obtained in vitro, the mobilization of this copper probably occurs through the solubilization of these particles. In contrast, and as supported by the in vitro data, D-penicillamine had little effect on copper bound to metallothionein in the cytosol. Conclusion: Our results on Long Evans cinnamon rat provide some conclusions on the mechanism of action of D-penicillamine in therapy of Wilson's disease. The drug prevents the formation or promotes the solubilization of copper-rich particles found in the lysosomes of hepatocytes and Kupffer cells in the liver of patients with Wilson's disease. Once chelated with D-penicillamine, copper can then be excreted in the urine. However, the mobilization of copper by D-penicillamine appears to be limited due to the binding of the metal to metallothionein in the liver cytosol. This copper can obviously be well tolerated even in relatively high concentrations.",,"Klein, D.;Lichtmannegger, J.;Heinzmann, U.;Summer, K. H.",2000,February,,0,0,

The copA gene was disrupted by insertion of a kanamycin gene by homologous recombination. The mutant strain was more sensitive to copper salts but not to salts of other metals, suggesting a role in copper homeostasis. The copper-sensitive phenotype could be rescued by complementation with a plasmid carrying copA from E. coli or copB from Enterococcus hirae. The expression of copA was induced by copper or silver salts, but not by zinc or cobalt. Everted membrane vesicles from cells expressing copA showed ATP-coupled accumulation of copper, presumably as Cu(I). The results demonstrate that CopA is a Cu(I) translocating efflux pump similar to the copper pumps associated with Menkes and Wilson diseases and provides a useful prokaryotic model for these human diseases.",,"Rensing, C.;Fan, B.;Sharma, R.;Mitra, B.;Rosen, B.

LEC and Wistar rats (normal Cu metabolism) were injected intravenously with TTM as a single dose of 2, 10 or 50 mg TTM/kg body weight, and subsequently the concentrations of Cu and molybdenum (Mo) in bile and plasma were monitored at the post-injection time. In Wistar rats, most of the Mo was excreted in the urine, only a small amount was excreted in the bile, while the urinary excretion of Cu decreased. However, in LEC rats, Cu and Mo were excreted into bile and blood, and bile is recognized as the major excretion route for the first time. The Cu excreted in both bile and plasma was accompanied by an equimolar amount of Mo. The relative ratio of the amounts of Cu excreted in the bile and plasma was 40/60 for the low and high dose groups and 70/30 for the medium dose groups. The systemic dispositions of the Cu mobilized from the liver and the Mo complexed with Cu were also determined for the kidneys, spleen and brain and their urinary excretion. Although Mo in the three organs and Cu in kidneys and spleen increased or showed a tendency to increase, Cu in brain was not increased at all TTM doses.

2403,Therapy of Wilson's disease. [German],"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive copper storage disease that occurs predominantly in adolescents and young adults. The clinical manifestations are dominated by hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. Diagnostic procedures include determination of total serum copper, serum free copper and serum ceruloplamin concentrations, and urinary copper excretion. The diagnosis can be confirmed by liver biopsy and histological determination of the copper content. The aim of the treatment is to reduce the copper concentration in the tissue and to detoxify the copper. The drugs used are the chelating agents. D-penicillamine and trientine or zinc. The chelating agents induce renal and biliary copper excretion and increased synthesis of metallothionein, which stores and detoxifies intracellular copper, resulting in impaired absorption and binding of excess intracellular copper. Zinc treatment leads to induction of hepatic and intestinal metallothionein synthesis. To check the therapeutic effect, regular examinations of the parameters of the copper metabolism are necessary. Serum concentrations of free copper and urinary copper excretion should reach values below 10 micrograms/dl and 80 micrograms/day, respectively. A significant improvement in the clinical symptoms and a normalization of the parameters of the copper metabolism can be expected six months after the start of therapy at the earliest. Anti-copper treatment can be accompanied by a copper-restricted diet. Lifelong therapy is required and offers a near-normal life expectancy. Interruption of treatment leads to reaccumulation of copper, often leading to fulminant liver failure. This can also be observed as a first presentation in 5% of cases (mainly aged 12 to 25 years). End-stage liver disease and fulminant liver failure are indications for liver transplantation, which phenotypically cures the gene defect. No decopper treatment is required here.

After 18 weeks, the dosage of penicillamine was reduced from 900 mg/d to 750 mg/d. The course of the pregnancy remained uncomplicated. A healthy boy of 3100 g was born at 38 + 1 week. 19 months later, the patient presented again at 16 weeks of her second pregnancy. With regard to Wilson's disease, no significant changes were observed; in particular, liver and kidney function were not impaired. The dosage of penicillamine was reduced from 900 mg/d to 750 mg/d in the 21st week. The pregnancy was again uncomplicated and resulted in the spontaneous birth of a healthy boy weighing 3940 g at 38 + 2 weeks. Both children were breastfed for a period of three months and, with the exception of prolonged jaundice, no side effects were noted.",,"Messner, U.;Gunter, H. H.;Niesert, St",1998,,,0,0,
2413,Treatment of chronic Wilson's disease in 2 patients with plasmapheresis - clinical-biochemical observations. [Croatian],"INTRODUCTION: The introduction of penicillamine to treat Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) was a historic event [1]. D-Pericillamine (d-PAM) showed some potential side effects like myasthenia, renal toxicity etc. In the past decade, treatment of Wilson's disease (WD) with zinc sulfate started successfully [4]. Danks [7] described the use of exchange transfusions, peritoneal dialysis, and plasmapheresis in the management of young WM patients with acute liver failure. These patients had acute copper poisoning. The results of this study were favorable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Therapeutic plasmapheresis (PF) is used in many diseases in which immunological mechanisms have been demonstrated [8, 9]. We started using PF in the treatment of two young chronic patients with Wilson's disease. The clinical picture of the patients worsened, probably due to the decrease in the cupriuretic effect of d-PAM. One patient (1) did not take d-PAM regularly. In this study, PF was performed using Haemonetics V-50 and 704 filter. During treatment with PF, 2000 ml of plasma was always exchanged, ie removed. During treatment with PF, patients were hospitalized at the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry of Children and Adolescents. CASE REPORT AND RESULTS: Patient #1. A 24-year-old male, born in 1965, presented with a gross tremor. At the age of 18 he was diagnosed with WD. Kayser-Fleischer rings were found in the cornea during a slit lamp examination. The disease began at the age of 15 with polymorphic symptoms. As time went by, the trembling increased. It was obvious when the patient made a movement. The first treatment with PF (1) lasted from February 13 to March 16, 1989. The patient had 10 PF with no side effects. During treatment with PF, the patient felt better. After PF tremor was significantly reduced and the subjective and objective condition improved. Patient (1) was hospitalized again on June 24, 1991 to continue treatment with PF. Anamnestic data and neurological examination showed disease progression. His condition worsened, especially the tremors. He could not write a single letter (Figures 1-5) and could walk without the help of others. His tremors became strongest when he made any arbitrary movement. The second treatment with PF began on June 25, 1991 and ended on July 16, 1991. In this series he received 9 PF. The treatment was without side effects. Tremor has been reduced by approximately 15%. Plasma copper examined before and after 9 PF showed different values (Table 2). This difference (2.79 µmol/L; 23.70%) in plasma copper level was removed from the circulation. Patient #2. A 23-year-old male, born in 1966, was hospitalized with an acute exacerbation of WM. At the age of 16, a latent psychosis was diagnosed. A year later the hospital was diagnosed with WM when he was 17 years old. Kayser-Fleischer rings were found in the cornea by slit lamp examination. Treatment with d-PAM and other drugs (BAL, symptomatic therapies, tranquilizers, antidepressants, etc.) was accompanied by good and long-lasting remissions and brief exacerbations. A few years later the exacerbation got longer and longer and worse and worse. He was hospitalized on November 28, 1989 with an acute relapse of WD. His condition was very difficult, completely bedridden. Treatment with PF began on December 26, 1989 and continued until January 25, 1990. Treatment with PF was without d-PAM. He received only symptomatic therapies. After a few PF, he showed side effects with nausea, sometimes vomiting, facial sweating, pulse rate around 120/min with normal blood pressure. Therefore, human albumin was administered to him the next day, and no side effects were observed. Removal of low levels of plasma copper from the circulation correlated well with a small improvement in clinical symptoms. The stiffness was reduced and voluntary movements bec",,"Milovanovic, D.

[Chinese],"AIM: To observe the effect of combination therapy of traditional and western medicine (TCM-WM) on brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) in patients with hepatolenticular degeneration. METHODS: BAEP was recorded and analyzed in 65 patients with hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD) before and after decoppered TCM-WM treatment. RESULTS: The peak latency (PL) and interpeak latency (IPL) of BAEP in untreated patients were greatly increased compared to those in the control group, particularly in the prolongations of III, V, III-V and IV PL and IPL improved as an improvement in clinical symptoms in HLD patients treated with TCM-WM than in untreated patients. Male and female BAEP abnormal rates were reduced from 21.97% and 19.05%, respectively, in untreated patients to 9.09% and 6.75%, respectively, in treated patients. CONCLUSION: BAEP not only has a complementary diagnosis but also assesses the effectiveness of treatment of HLD disease.",,"Xu, S. H.;Cai, Y. L.;Yang, R. M.",1997,Jan,,0,0,
2416,"A late form of Wilson's disease, with a psychiatric initial aspect and pseudo-compulsive stereotypes, neuroradiological connections. [French]","Wilson's disease rarely begins after the third decade of life and can be associated with misleading psychiatric symptoms. We observed a 39-year-old white male who developed hysterical behavior followed by overt delusional psychosis. Secondary neurological symptoms such as astasia and dysarthria have been misinterpreted as drug-induced. Despite treatment with D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate, there was further deterioration with anarthria and pseudo-compulsive stereotypies. These latter signs disappeared after five months, while astasia and abasia remained unchanged and MRI imaging showed further deterioration characterized by marked bilateral putaminal cavitation. SPECT imaging could not predict clinical evolution. Our case emphasizes that Wilson's disease can have variable onsets and confirms the relationship between pseudo-obsessive-compulsive stereotypies and bilateral lenticular lesions previously described in other basal ganglia disorders.",,"Garnier, H.;Diederich, N.;Pilloy, W.;Lenaerts, M.;Dooms, G.;Metz, H.",1997,March,,0,0,

The drug was injected subcutaneously into 40-day-old Long Evans cinnamon rats at 5 mg/kg body weight for 65 days (total dose of 20 mg). In Long-Evans cinnamon rats treated with tetrathiomolybdate, the copper concentration in the liver was 60 µg/g wet weight compared to 170 µg/g in untreated rats. The Cu concentration (1.5 to 2.3 µg/g) was slightly lower (1 .6 to 2.7 µg/g) than in untreated rats. A significant difference between the two groups was found only in the midbrain. Brain iron concentrations in regions other than the striatum were not significantly altered by the tetrathiomolybdate injections. The hepatic Fe concentration in Long Evans cinnamon rats without tetrathiomolybdate was about 120 µg/g. Tetrathiomolybdate injection further increased the concentration to about 250 cups/g. Our results showed that subcutaneous tetrathiomolybdate injection had no effect stimulating Cu and Fe redistribution in the seven brain regions examined, although hepatic Cu was markedly decreased and removed Cu was deposited in kidney, spleen, and testis.

2425,Zinc and manganese in schizophrenia,"The essential trace elements zinc and manganese have been known to be factors in brain diseases since the 1920s. The combined use of zinc and manganese in schizophrenia is based on: 1) increased urinary excretion of copper when both zinc and manganese are orally administered; 2) Zinc alone causes a decrease in blood manganese; 3) The double deficiency of zinc and manganese is often found in patients with excess copper. Mallow factor (cryptopyrrole) is known to increase zinc and vitamin B<inf>6</inf> (pyridoxine) excretion. In children, inadequate zinc and manganese levels have been linked to reduced learning ability, apathy, lethargy, and mental retardation. Hyperactive children may be deficient in zinc, manganese, and vitamin B<inf>6</inf> and have excess lead and copper. Alcoholism, schizophrenia, Wilson's disease and Pick's disease are brain disorders that are dynamically related to zinc and manganese levels. Zinc has been used successfully to treat Wilson's disease, achrodermatitis enteropathica, and certain types of schizophrenia. Manganese is important for the synthesis and degradation cycles of proteins and nucleic acids. Manganese proved to be a better effector than magnesium for the initiation of the RNA chain. Manganese stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in brain tissue. Because cyclic AMP plays a regulatory role in the effects of several neurotransmitters in the brain, manganese is important for brain function. Due to the fact that zinc is well absorbed from the intestine, but manganese is poorly absorbed, all diagnostic categories can be harmed by long oral doses of zinc without manganese. In oral doses, manganese occasionally increases blood pressure in patients over 40 years of age. Zinc alone can lower blood pressure in some hypertensive patients. Chronic consumption of hydralazine (a manganese chelator) in rats caused manganese deficiency, leading to convulsions. Low blood and serum manganese levels may play a role in epilepsy by affecting membrane stability. Prolonged use of phenothiazines causes tardive dyskinesia. Phenothiazines can chelate manganese, making it unavailable for some putative enzyme activator functions.",,"Pfeiffer, C. C.;LaMola, S.",1999,First Quarter,,0,0,

[Chinese],"Aim To summarize the long-term effects of combined treatment with high-dose zinc sulfate and low-dose penicillamine in children with hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD). Methods Patients with symptoms were treated with high-dose zinc sulfate (100-150 mg, < 6 years; 150-200 mg, 6-8 years; 200-300 mg, 9-10 years; 300 mg, > 10 years; 3 times a day ) treated in addition to low-dose penicillamine (8-10 mg/kg/d) at the start of treatment. Zinc sulfate alone was administered to pre-symptomatic patients and used as maintenance therapy when clinical improvement was achieved. 31 children were followed up over a period of 4-11 years. Results No clinical abnormalities were found in 3 pre-symptomatic patients. Among the 28 patients with symptoms, 23 patients (82%) had their symptoms and signs reduced or greatly improved, 2 patients (7%) remained unchanged, and 3 (11%) died. Blood copper concentrations were persistently lower than normal. Urinary copper excretion was significantly lower in all patients after 24 hours than before the combination therapy and normalized in 5 cases (16%) after 6 months of treatment and in 26 cases (84%) after 1-2 years of treatment. Higher zinc concentrations in the blood were detected in 20 cases (65%) and a higher zinc excretion in the urine in 25 cases (81%) once or several times during therapy.

These simulations support the conclusion that the liver is not ""decoppered"" by D-penicillamine in either Wilson's disease patients or normal subjects.

LEC rats administered TTM (LEC+TTM group) regained body weight and jaundice quickly disappeared. However, LEC rats without TTM (LEC-TTM group) were greatly reduced in body weight and showed severe jaundice 103 days after birth. The Cu concentration in the liver of LEC+TTM rats (460 µg/g) exceeded that of LEC control rats (330 µg/g) 125 days after birth.

To prevent hepatitis, 30-day-old LEC rats were orally administered two Zn compounds, Zn acetate and polaprezink. 100 days after birth, the control group consisting of LEC rats fed a basal diet (Cu, 17 ppm; Zn, 50 ppm; Fe, 150 ppm) showed mild jaundice and showed high activities of serum enzymes associated with the related to liver function. The groups given the diet fortified (1000 ppm as Zn) with Zn acetate or polaprezink did not have jaundice. The hepatic Cu concentrations were 174 +/- 34 µg/g and 156 +/- 23 µg/g in the polaplezinc group and the Zn acetate group, respectively. The control group showed 267 +/- 17 µg Cu/g and 298 +/- 62 µg Fe/g in the liver. The Fe concentration was about 1.7 times the concentration in the two Zn groups. The free Cu and Fe concentrations in the liver were 2.6 +/- 0.3 and 21.4 +/- 5.8 µg/g, 1.7 +/- 0.7 and 6.8 +/- - 1.1 µg/g and 1.3 +/- 0.1 and 6.2 +/- 0.8 µg/g in the control, polaprezinc and zinc acetate groups, respectively. Intestinal metallothionein (MT) concentrations were not significantly increased by the Zn diets.

2433,Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease),"BACKGROUND Wilson's disease is a recessively inherited disorder in which a homozygous mutation in the copper ATPase ATP7B gene (located on chromosome 13) reduces the liver's ability to secrete ceruloplasmin into the plasma and excrete it into the bile. REVIEW SUMMARY – Systemic copper accumulation leads to progressive hepatic dysfunction, neurological impairment, psychiatric disorders, or combinations of these symptoms. Wilson's disease is diagnosed by measuring copper excretion in 24-hour urine, followed by measuring copper in a liver biopsy sample. Wilson's disease is treated with copper removal therapy (penicillamine or trientine) followed by zinc maintenance therapy. The frequent exacerbation of neurological impairments by penicillamine has led to the use of tetrathiol molybdate as an alternative decoppering agent. CONCLUSION – Wilson's disease should be considered in all patients with unexplained hepatic dysfunction and those with unexplained progressive movement disorders or psychiatric disorders. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential. Tetrathiolmolybdate appears to be as effective as penicillamine and is associated with less frequent neurological deterioration compared to penicillamine.",,"Fink, J. K.;Hedera, P.;Brewer, G.

2436,Anesthesia management in a patient with Wilson's disease. [Japanese],"Characterized by cirrhosis, extrapyramidal symptoms and Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings, Wilson disease is a rare congenital disorder characterized by abnormal copper metabolism. Despite many anaesthesiological problems, there are no reports from the field of dental anaesthesiology. We report an anesthesia management case with Wilson's disease. The patient was a 24-year-old male with a large number of teeth to be extracted. At the age of 11 he was diagnosed with Wilson's disease and treated with D-penicillamine. He had cirrhosis, but liver laboratory profiles were normal with no slight elevations in CTT (12.6 U) and TTT (5.2 U) (Table 1). Esophageal varices had been treated two years previously by endoscopic varicosclerotherapy. Serum copper (16 µg/dl) and ceruloplasmin (less than 0.4 mg/dl) concentrations were markedly reduced and urinary copper excretion was increased (130 µg/dl). He had extrapyramidal symptoms such as dysarthria, involuntary movements, and muscle stiffness, but mental function was preserved. After induction of anesthesia with thiamylal, vecuronium, nitrous oxide, oxygen and isoflurane, general anesthesia with nitrous oxide, oxygen and isoflurane was maintained (Fig. 1). Because the effect of vecuronium was expected to be prolonged due to hepatic dysfunction, we monitored the degree of neuromuscular blockade with a nerve stimulator, but recovery from muscle relaxation was normal. During surgery, the ECG initially showed first-degree AV block and then progressed to second-degree AV block (Wenckebach type) (Fig. 2). The second-degree atrioventricular block resolved after administration of atropine sulfate (0.5 mg), and the patient's hemodynamic condition was stable until the end of the operation. No serious complications occurred during the entire operation. No postoperative deterioration in hepatic or renal function or extrapyramidal symptoms were observed. The majority of Wilson patients respond to treatment with penicillamine and allow them to resume normal life. General anesthesia may be required for dental treatment due to involuntary movements or muscle stiffness. We emphasize the need for adequate preoperative screening for cardiac involvement such as electrocardiographic abnormalities and cardiomyopathy, and preoperative evaluation of liver function. In addition, the side effects of D-penicillamine such as myasthenia gravis and fever also had to be considered.",,"Tanaka, K.;Kamekura, N.;Teramoto, T.;Kimura, Y.;Fukushima, K.",1999,,,0,0,

ATP7B has been extensively identified in neuronal cells of the hippocampal formation, olfactory bulb, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and brainstem nuclei, in which high levels of copper and cuproenzymes, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn- SOD) were found. The present results suggest that ATP7B plays a key role in neurotransmission of the catecholamine pathway and prevents brain tissue damage by superoxide radicals to regulate cellular Cu concentration and/or cuproenzyme activities related to neurotransmissions and free radical metabolism . In addition, neurotoxicity due to abnormal accumulation of copper or irregular regulation of cuproenzymes in the critical brain regions by mutation of ATP7B gene may lead to neurological deficits in Wilson's disease.",,"Saito, T.;Okabe, M.;Hosokawa, T.;Kurasaki, M.;Hata, A.;Endo, F.;Nagano, K.;Matsuda, I.;Urakami, K.

We observed the emergence of LKM1 autoantibodies 4 months after liver transplantation for Wilson's disease, in close association with a steroid-resistant rejection episode, without evidence of autoimmune hepatitis or hepatitis C. Methods: Sera from multiple time points before and after transplantation were analyzed by immunofluorescence, ELISA tested for LKM reactivity and western blotting. Antigen specificity was confirmed by Western blotting analysis on different cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The absence of hepatitis C and hepatitis G viral infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. The serum from the organ donor was also tested. Results: All sera before transplantation and up to 4 months after transplantation were negative for all test systems used. During the course of a steroid-resistant rejection episode at this time, the patient developed high titer LKM antibodies (70% by inhibition ELISA) and has remained positive ever since (now more than 4 years). The reactivity concerned only the cytochrome isoenzyme 2D6. Hepatitis C infection never occurred, but hepatitis G was transiently present many years before the transplant. The donor serum was negative for all autoantibodies and for hepatitis C and G virus infections. Discussion: We describe here a patient who develops LKM1 autoantibodies without evidence of autoimmune or viral hepatitis. The close temporal association with a transplant rejection episode suggests immunological rejection mechanisms along with hepatocellular damage as a pathogenetic mechanism.",,"Lohse, A.

2441,Hepatic hereditary metabolic disorders of metals. [Slovak],"The authors deal with hereditary metabolic diseases of metals leading to liver damage, mainly hereditary metabolic diseases of copper and iron. Copper is an essential metal in the organism that facilitates electron transfer in many critical biological reactions and is a component of numerous biologically important enzymes. Of the hereditary metabolic diseases of copper, Wilson's disease is the most important, since it is diagnosed too late at the stage of severe liver damage. New findings in the pathogenesis are emphasized - gene for P-type of ATP-ase ATP 7B (so-called WD protein) on chromosome 13q14.3, lack of Cu transport from the cell through the cell membrane, ie Cu excretion into the bile, persistent fetal Cu metabolism with predominant metalothionein instead of ceruloplasmin, complex diagnostic approach and new treatment approaches (zinc). The authors analyze the complexity of hereditary hemochromatosis, emphasizing its frequent occurrence, knowledge of genetics - mutation of the HLA-H gene (HFE), Fe deposits in tissues and fibrosis stimulation by monocytes, and the mechanism of development of bronze diabetes. As a screening, they recommend examining the transferin saturation (above 50% is highly suspicious hemochromatosis), ferritin concentration over 1000 µg/l, genetic analysis, liver biopsy and the validity of imaging procedures. In terms of treatment, the authors emphasize eliminating the Fe oversupply, and in terms of prognosis, they point to the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.",,"Sasinka, M.;Krusovsky, S.;Kovacova, M.",1999,,,0,0,
2442,Hepatic hyperplasia and cancer in rats: changes in copper metabolism,"We have previously shown that rats exposed to the peroxisome proliferator (PP) diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) had decreased serum ceruloplasmin (CP) oxidase activity, indicating copper deposition in tissues. Excess copper is highly toxic and leads to cell damage and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study addresses changes in copper-related gene expression and metal accumulation in hyperplastic liver and tumors induced by PP. Male rats were fed diets containing DEHP or clofibrate (CLF) for 3-60 days (hyperplasia) and supplemented with 4-chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinyl-thio(N -beta-hydroxyethyl)acetamide (HCC). During hyperplasia, an immediate and progressive decrease in serum CP activity was observed (P<0.05), as was a reduction in mRNA levels for both CP and Wilson disease genes (WD gene, a P-type ATPase) (P<0.05), tumor-bearing rats had lower serum CP activity (P<0.05), and CP and WD gene mRNA levels were higher in tumors ( P<0.05) and in liver-surrounding tumors (SL) (P<0.05). Metallothionein mRNA showed no consistent changes during hyperplasia. Tumors showed a 2.5-fold induction of metallothionein mRNA (P<0.05) and a 1.2-fold increase in SL. Temporal increases in hepatic copper occurred during hyperplasia, with increases of 2-fold (DEHP) and 3.3-fold (CLF) at 60 days (P<0.05). Copper content was 2.2-fold higher (P<0.05) in tumors and 1.7-fold higher in SL; Iron did not increase and zinc decreased over time. Thus, copper accumulation and changes in copper-related gene expression may be contributing factors to liver neoplasia in PP-treated rats. Loss of CP results in decreased free radical scavenging capacity and thus may enhance PP-induced oxidative damage.",,"Eagon, P. K.;Teepe, A. G.;Elm, M. S.;Tadic, S. D.;Epley, M. J.;Beiler, B.

2444,Liver transplantation in Wilson's disease,"Liver transplantation is the only etiological therapy for Wilson disease and is the treatment of choice for Wilson disease, which presents as fulminant liver failure, and for Wilson's disease patients with end-stage cirrhosis. The effect of liver transplantation on the neurological manifestations of the disease has been studied in some patients. We analyzed our personal data with literature reports on Wilson's disease patients with neurological symptoms who underwent liver transplantation and obtained information on 40 patients. The transplant cured or improved neurological symptoms in 32 of them (80%). This favorable result raises the question of whether liver transplantation should also be offered to patients with neurological Wilson's disease but stable liver function. In view of the still high mortality after liver transplantation, the neurological status in Wilson's disease patients with stable liver function cannot be a general indication for liver transplantation, which in these cases is still to be regarded as experimental. Notwithstanding, liver transplantation could be considered in patients with severely disabling, medically untreatable neurological deterioration by thoroughly informing them about the risks of surgery.",,"Stracciari, A.;Guarino, M.;Tempestini, A.;D'Alessandro, R.;Pazzaglia, P.",1999,,,0,0,
2445,Familien von Weichmetallionen transportierenden ATPasen,"In the last 5 years, great progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of action and the evolution of soft metal ATPases. Evolutionary pressures to thrive despite the geological ubiquity of metals has ensured that soft metal resistance gene families are not confined to a single species or even kingdom. Many questions remain to be answered, and we look forward to accelerating knowledge gain in the near future. One question is the function of ArsA homologues. In bacteria, the arsA gene clearly encodes the catalytic subunit of the ArsAB pump. It is not known whether the eukaryotic and archeal arsA homologues are orthologues or encode proteins with unrelated functions. Eukaryotes have mechanisms of resistance to arsenic. In both Leishmania and Chinese hamster cells, we have shown that resistance is related to active extrusion of arsenite (44). But at this point, the genes or gene products that create resistance have not been identified. A second question is the distribution of soft metal chaperones in bacteria. While homologues of copper chaperones such as Atx1p and Lys7p are widespread in eukaryotes (12), they do not appear to be found in bacteria. CopZ fulfills a chaperone function in E. hirae (10), but homologues with copper chaperone activity have not been found in other bacteria. In addition, it is not clear whether cells require chaperones for non-redox-active metals such as Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II). A third question is the distribution of ZntA homologues in nature. The related P-type Cu(I)-translocating ATPases are found in most organisms. In humans, these pumps are required for copper homeostasis, and mutations in the ATP7A or ATP7B gene result in inborn defects in copper metabolism, leading to Menkes and Wilson's disease, respectively. Although zinc is not as toxic as copper, partly because it is not a redox-active metal, it is still toxic in excess and mechanisms must be in place to prevent overaccumulation. To date, a growing number of zntA and cadA genes for zinc-translocating P-type ATPases have been identified. Genes for putative ATP-dependent zinc pumps are being discovered in other kingdoms, for example in the genome of the archaon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (GenBank Accession No. 2621474) and in the genome of the plant A. thaliana (GenBank Accession No. 4210504). Within the next 5 years the sequencing of the human genome - and many others - will be complete. At this point, the phylogenetic distribution of zinc pumps and their involvement in human health and disease are better understood.",,"Rensing, C.;Ghosh, M.;Rosen, B. P.",1999,October,,0,0,

2447,Identification of the zinc-binding protein present specifically in male rat liver as carbonic anhydrase III,"zinc (Zn)-binding protein specific to male adult rat liver was detected by HPLC with in-line detection by mass spectrometry (ICP MS). The Zn-binding protein was purified on Sephadex G-75 and G3000SW HPLC columns and identified as carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII) based on the amino acid sequence of a peptide obtained by lysylendopeptidase digestion. CAIII is age-dependently expressed as one of the major Zn-binding proteins in the liver of male rats, with Zn being bound to CAIII at comparable levels to copper, Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) at 8 weeks of age. Castration at 4 or 8 weeks of age was shown to reduce CAIII-bound Zn to 47.5% of sham control levels, suggesting that sex-dependent expression of CAIII is regulated in part by a sex hormone, androgen. The CAIII concentration in the livers of cinnamon-colored Long Evans rats (LEC rats), an animal model of Wilson's disease, was also estimated as Zn bound to CAIII and was lower than that in Wistar rats before the onset of hepatitis .

The majority of patients were adolescents or young adults, who usually had the disease for several years. Patients were often untreated, poorly treated, or induced by d-penicillamine treatment. The clinical features were contralateral weakness, tremor and dystonia. Psychiatric symptoms, particularly schizophrenia-like psychoses, were common and may be the first presentation.

Remission rates in children have been reported to range from 20% to 58%. The recently available lamuvidin has also been used in combination with interferon therapy. Oral chelation therapy and liver transplantation have radically impacted the outcome of patients with Wilson's disease. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy are effective in reducing both morbidity and mortality from autoimmune hepatitis. Objectionable carbohydrates are eliminated from the diet of patients with galactosemia and hereditary fructose intolerance. The most important and often neglected component of the management of chronic liver disease in childhood is nutritional management and prompt interventions for ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal hypertension, and hepatic encephalopathy. With definitive etiological and histological assessment and initiation of specific and supportive therapy, children with chronic liver disease can have prolonged survival with improved quality of life.

The localization of the EEG generators in the patients with clinically manifest neurological symptoms was more superficial in all frequency bands compared to controls and patients without neurological symptoms. The lower the premorbid intelligence with longer disease duration, the more posterior the delta EEG generator was located. Although the alpha-EEG generator was located more anteriorly with longer disease duration and more severe cognitive deficits, it was more superficial with more pronounced psychiatric symptoms, more severe cognitive deficits, lower premorbid intelligence and more pronounced motor disabilities. With more pronounced psychiatric symptoms and cognitive deficits, the beta EEG generator was located more anteriorly.

2455,Intracellular localization of Menkes and Wilson disease proteins and their role in intracellular copper transport,"Copper is a heavy metal ion that is essential for the activity of a variety of enzymes in the body. In excess, copper is a very toxic ion and therefore efficient regulation of its metabolism is required. This is dramatically illustrated by the genetic disorders X-linked Menkes disease and autosomal recessive Wilson disease. In 1993 both the Menkes and Wilson genes were isolated and these genes were found to encode homologous copper cations that transport P-type ATPase proteins. Menkes protein (ATP7A) is expressed in most tissues except liver. In contrast, the Wilson protein (ATP7B) is abundantly expressed in the liver. The intracellular localization of these proteins has been investigated. Both ATP7A and ATP7B are localized in the trans-Golgi network and in the post-Golgi vesicular compartment (PGVC) in the cell. This intracellular localization was altered by the level of copper present in the cell. This result could support the hypothesis that ATP7A and ATP7B are involved in cellular copper transport and that these proteins could be suitable models to elucidate intracellular copper metabolism.",,"Suzuki, M.;Gitlin, J.

2457,disruptions in copper transport,"Copper is an essential part of a number of important enzymes. Efficient systems have been designed to provide sufficient copper for essential functions while eliminating excess copper to avoid tissue toxicity. Copper transport is disrupted in two human diseases: Wilson's disease and Menkes' disease. Both have defects in copper-transporting membrane proteins. Many other proteins are involved in copper transport. Some of these proteins were identified by examining the similar copper pathway in yeast. This suggests that other copper transport diseases have yet to be discovered. Molecular diagnostics promise a reliable diagnosis of patients. Flanking marker testing is a reliable way to detect pre-symptomatic siblings of a given patient. While most heavy metals are either too rare or too insoluble to be of biological importance, at least eleven appear to be essential for normal function. These include vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, selenium, molybdenum and tin<sup>1</sup>. Most of these metals, while essential for normal function, are toxic when present in excess. Little is known about the mechanisms of homeostatic control required to maintain the delicate balance between necessity and toxicity.

One male and one female beagle dog received oral administration of trientine-2HCl at variable doses (50 to 2000 mg/kg) or at constant doses of 200 or 600 mg/kg/day for two weeks. After a single dose of 2000 or 1000 mg/kg, severe symptoms (abnormal gait, ataxia, vomiting, diarrhea, body tremors) and significant weight loss occurred. In the constant dose phase, similar treatment effects were evident in both animals receiving 600 mg/kg/day. The approximate lethal dose has been assumed to be more than 2000 mg/kg. 2) Four-week study. Beagle dogs received oral trientine 2HCl at doses of 50, 125, or 300 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, followed by a 4-week reversibility period. There were no deaths. In some animals receiving 300 mg/kg/day hypoactivity, abnormal gait, ataxia and body tremors were observed during the last week of treatment. In the lungs, interstitial pneumonia was recorded in one control male and four animals receiving 300 mg/kg/day with or without rest. Toxicokinetic analysis revealed that the animals' exposure to trientine-2HCl was dose-dependent and that there was no significant accumulation of trientine-2HCl over the dosing period. 3) 26-week study. Beagle dogs should receive trientine 2HCl orally at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks followed by a 13-week reversibility period. However, in view of the severe symptoms that led to the humane killing of two male dogs and one female dog receiving 200 mg/kg/day at week 9 of treatment, surviving dogs in this group were only treated for 10 weeks. Pre-shipment signs included marked underactivity, body tremors, abnormal gait, restricted limb use, and prone position. Ante-mortem neurological examination generally revealed depressed postural and flexion-withdrawal responses. Signs were rapidly reversible, except in the one woman who was humanely killed on day 2 of the reversibility period. From the 23rd week of treatment, abnormal ""stiff-legged"" gait and hypoactivity occurred in two men and one woman receiving 100 mg/kg/day.

2465,"A critical review of copper metabolism in children with Wilson's disease, with particular reference to their phenotypes and relatives","Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accumulation of copper in various organs with the most common clinical manifestations being hepatic, neurological and renal dysfunction. Serum copper and ceruloplasmin were significantly lower in Wilson's disease compared to normal subjects, controls and relatives of Wilson's disease patients, while marked hypercupriuria (145 +/- 7 µg/24 h) was observed only in Wilson's children. A good correlation (r=0.92) was found between non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper and 24-hour urinary copper excretion in patients with Wilson's disease. In addition, copper studies in the various phenotypes of Wilson's disease have shown significantly low serum ceruloplasmin and marked hypercupriuria in children with Wilson's disease associated with renal tubular acidosis compared to patients with either hepatological or neurological manifestations. Serum ceruloplasmin levels in 14 patients with Wilson's disease ranged from 14 to 20 mg/dL.

Copper is essential for bone growth and development, and copper supplementation reduces bone loss in middle-aged women. Copper deficiency is indicated by the presence of long bone abnormalities (osteopenia, fraying and cupping of the provisional calcification zone, metaphyseal spurs, fractures), psychomotor retardation, hypotension, hypopigmentation, prominent scalp veins in palpable periosteal depressions, pallor, sideroblastic anemia resistant to iron treatment, vacuolated erythroid and myeloid Cells in the bone marrow with iron deposits in the vacuoles and some mitochondria, hepatosplenomegaly, neutropenia (<1.0 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L), and serum copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations below 6.28 mmol/L and 0, respectively .13 g/l. Inadvertent copper depletion from overzealous zinc therapy or chelation therapy (e.g., deferoxamine or EDTA) to treat heavy metal toxicity, vascular disease, or intermittent claudication is of obvious concern. Intentional copper chelation with drugs such as penicillamine to treat abnormalities such as Wilson's disease, Parkinson's disease, and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can also deplete copper stores. Signs of copper deficiency associated with perinatal stress are sometimes confused with unexplained fractures in non-accidental infant injuries, sometimes manifested in battered child syndrome. Boron is beneficial for mineral, vitamin D, insulin and energy substrate metabolism and immune function in animals and humans. Dietary boron, in particular, has physiological effects that are beneficial to bone growth and maintenance. Further characterizing the metabolic role of these and other trace minerals in the context of bone metabolism appears to be an extremely prudent endeavor given the likely association of several refractory bone diseases with trace and ultratrace mineral nutrition.",,"Hunt, C.

2471,Targeting of tetrathiomolybdate to copper that accumulates in the liver of LEC rats,"Hepatic uptake of tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) and removal of copper (Cu), which accumulates in the liver in a metallothionein (MT)-bound form, by TTM was demonstrated in Long Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats, an animal model by Wilson, studies disease to develop better treatments for the disease and Cu toxicity. Although molybdenum (Mo) was incorporated dose-dependently into the livers of both LEC and Long Evans agouti (LEA) rats, the original strain of LEC rats used as a reference animal, liver uptake was slow of LEC rats was 13 times higher than that of LEA rats. The concentration of Mo in the soluble fraction plateaued and it became more widely distributed in the insoluble fraction at a higher dose in LEC rats. The concentration of Cu in the whole liver of LEC rats was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by TTM only at lower doses. However, the Cu concentration in the soluble fraction continued to decrease with the TTM dose. The results can be explained by complex formation. Namely, TTM forms a complex with Cu, tentatively termed the Cu/TTM complex, which is allowed to leach into the bloodstream and then binds selectively to albumin when the TTM dose is low. On the other hand, TTM forms an insoluble complex called Cu/TTM polymer, which is precipitated in the liver when the dose is high. The results further indicate that TTM taken up by a cell is immobilized in the cell through the dose-dependent formation of a complex containing Cu, Mo and sulfur (S), causing further uptake of TTM. TTM injected into rats or incubated with serum in vitro does not remove Cu from ceruloplasmin. It is therefore proposed that TTM targets a cell that accumulates excess Cu as Cu-MT, and selectively removes Cu without interacting with Cu in Cu enzymes. The results indicate that depending on the amount of Cu produced, TTM is taken up by the liver in the form of MT and then Cu is flushed out into the bloodstream together with Mo in the form of a Cu/TTM complex.",,"Ogra, Y.;Suzuki, K.

2472,Zinc in Human Health: An Update,"This review covered topics such as zinc and growth, zinc and serum testosterone levels, the association of zinc and iron deficiency, zinc and Alzheimer's disease, zinc as a therapeutic agent, and the role of zinc in immunity. A meta-analysis of zinc supplementation studies from nine countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, eight from North America or Europe, five from Asia and the Middle East, and three from Africa found a highly significant effect of zinc supplementation on height and weight in children under 13 years of age. It appears that zinc's growth-stimulating effects are mediated through changes in circulating IGF-1. A recent study from China showed that zinc supplementation improved neuropsychological functioning in children aged 6 to 9 years. A study from Birmingham, Alabama, showed that women who were given zinc gave birth to infants who were heavier and had a larger head circumference compared to infants born to women who were not given zinc. Serum testosterone correlated with cellular zinc concentration in healthy adults aged 20 to 80 years. Therapeutic uses of zinc include treating childhood diarrhea and chronic diarrhea in developing countries, treating the common cold, and treating Wilson's disease. Recent studies have shown that zinc deficiency in humans leads to an imbalance between TH1 and TH2 cell functions, which is responsible for reduced cell-mediated immunity.

In a first experiment, three groups of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged with one of the following treatments for 5 days: 0.5 mmol/kg/day DPA, 0.046 mmol/kg/day zinc acetate dihydrate and 0.5 mmol /kg/day DPA plus 0.046 mmol/kg/day zinc acetate dihydrate. A fourth group of rats (control group) received deionized water during the same period. An increase in urinary copper excretion has been observed after DPA treatment continued for at least 5 days after cessation of administration of this compound. The amount of copper present in feces, including that in the diet, was approximately 60-fold greater than the amount normally present in control urine. During the period of zinc acetate administration, the amount of copper in the faeces was slightly but significantly greater than during the control, D-penicillamine or D-penicillamine plus zinc acetate administration. No differences between the treated groups and the control group were found in brain, liver, kidney and spleen concentrations of rats 5 days after the end of the treatment period.

Two males receiving 1200 mg/kg/day died during the 8th week of treatment. In men who received 1200 mg/kg/day for weeks 5 to 8 of treatment, body weight gain and food consumption were reduced, and hunched posture and thin physique were observed. During weeks 4 or 8 of treatment, urinalysis in males receiving 100 mg/kg/day or in animals receiving 350 mg/kg/day or more showed increased electrolyte excretion, possibly due to the hydrochloride nature of trientin-2- HCl, with low plasma alkaline phosphatase activities evident in animals receiving 350 or 1200 mg/kg/day. After 4 and 8 weeks and during the 8-week treatment, in animals receiving 1200 mg/kg/day, high lung weights and bronchiolar epithelial hypertrophy and bronchoalveolar pneumonia were recorded, and submucosal acute inflammation within the glandular region of the stomach was recorded for males receiving 350 or 1200 mg/kg/day and in all treated female groups. 26 week study. One man receiving 175 mg/kg/day and three men receiving 600 mg/kg/day died from lung changes. Body weight gain was slightly reduced in animals receiving 600 mg/kg/day. Blood chemistry and urinalysis tests showed changes similar to those reported in the 4- or 8-week study. The low plasma copper concentrations in men receiving 600 mg/kg/day, the slightly low hepatic copper concentrations in animals receiving 600 or 175 mg/kg/day, and the high urinary copper concentrations, common in all treated groups have been found are due to pharmacological action of trientine-2HCl. Histopathology showed a dose-dependent incidence and severity of focal chronic interstitial pneumonitis accompanied by fibrosis of the alveolar walls in females receiving 175 mg/kg/day or more and all treated male groups, but no significant pathologic changes in the stomach.

However, the long-term effects have not yet been fully studied, and some evidence questions the drug's long-term safety. The aim of the present study was to investigate the systemic distribution and retention of Cu and Mo in TTM-treated sheep of different breeds and the Cu status. Low-copper Cambridge sheep were divided into a TTM experimental group (3.4 mg/kg, subcutaneously, on three alternate days per month, for 5 months) and a control group and sacrificed at the end of the course or 7 months later. High Cu sheep consisting of a Cu-supplemented (150 mg/kg) Cambridge group and a North Ronaldsay group were administered TTM as before and compared to untreated controls. Brain, liver, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, pituitary, adrenal, testis, and ovaries were saved for metal analysis. Mo accumulated in all organs including brain and pituitary gland (p<0.02) in all TTM study groups and was maintained after treatment discontinuation except in liver, kidney and skeletal muscle. Cu was increased (P<0.02) and retained in the TTM-treated Cambridge groups with high Cu in the cerebellum and medulla oblongata. Brain Cu versus Mo concentrations showed a strong positive correlation (r 0.7) in the high Cu Ronaldsay group 7 months after TTM treatment. It is concluded that TTM is not completely excreted but (Mo) is widespread and retained in many organs including the brain and pituitary gland. In addition, TTM can redistribute some displaced excess liver Cu (Cu-TTM) to the brain. The consequences of these disturbances need to be clarified.",,"Haywood, S.;Dincer, Z.;Holding, J.;Parry, N.

This is possibly the first case showing an association between prolonged use of penicillamine and biopsy-proven systemic pseudo-pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The presenting symptoms may be due to the abnormal number and properties of elastic fibers, and the changes were caused by the use of penicillamine rather than idiopathic, inherited pseudoxanthoma elasticum.",,"Coatesworth, A.

2485,Metallothionein and apoptosis in the toxic milk mutant mouse,"Toxic milk mutant (tx) mice accumulate excess copper (Cu) in the liver with age and develop symptoms similar to those seen in human Wilson's disease. Since metallothionein (MT) is the major Cu-binding protein in the liver of tx mice and Cu-MT can enhance lipid peroxidation initiated by an organic hydroperoxide, the potential genotoxicity of Cu-MT in tx mice was evaluated in male tx mice (11 to 12 months old) and in age- and sex-matched control wild-type (DL) mice. Toxic milk mutant mice, but not control DL mice, developed regenerative liver nodules (tx-N) with normal histological appearance. Residual non-nodular tx mouse liver (tx-R) was microscopically abnormal with large, atypical hepatocytes. The concentrations of Cu, zinc (Zn) and MT and the number of apoptotic cells (APC) in tx-N, tx-R and DL livers were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, <sup>109</sup>cadmium -heme Assay or the TUNEL method. Significantly higher levels of MT, Cu and Zn and an increased number of APCs were found in both tx-N and tx-R compared to DL mouse livers. Intense nuclear and cytoplasmic immunohistochemical staining for MT was observed in both normal and atypical hepatocytes of the tx mouse, while only cytoplasmic staining for MT was detected in liver tissue of the DL mouse. Accumulated Cu could be detected in tx-R and tx-N liver by rhodamine staining, but was not detected in other tx mouse organs or in mouse liver or other organs of DL. The number of APC and MT levels were significantly higher in tx-R liver compared to both tx-N and DL liver. These results suggest that: (a) aged tx mice accumulate excess Cu in the liver, accompanied by striking morphological changes, and (b) although MT binds to Cu in the liver of tx mice, the presence of high Cu MT and Cu in the nucleus can be genotoxic and can lead to increased apoptosis.",,"Deng, D.

2487,Oxidative stress in LEC rats assessed by plasma antioxidants and free fatty acids,"The Long Evans cinnamon rat (LEC), an animal model of Wilson's disease, develops hepatitis and liver cancer. Because LEC rats accumulate copper particularly in the liver and because copper is a good oxidation catalyst, selected plasma markers of oxidative stress were measured in LEC rats and control Long Evans agouti (LEA) rats. A significant decrease in plasma ascorbate levels was observed even at the onset of hepatitis, suggesting that LEC rats are under oxidative stress since ascorbate is highly susceptible to oxidation. The ratio of plasma ubiquinol-9, another oxidatively susceptible antioxidant, to ubiquinone-9 in LEC rats also decreased significantly after onset of hepatitis. Oxidative damage in the liver of LEC rats after onset of hepatitis was also suggested by a decrease in the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to free fatty acids (FFA) and an increase in the ratio of palmitoleic acid to FFA in the plasma of LEC rats IM Compared to LEA rats, since PUFA are susceptible to oxidation and DELTA<sup>9</sup>-desaturase is activated to compensate for the loss of PUFA.

It is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner with respect to chromosome 13. The symptoms depend on the age of the patient. In children 4 to 10 years of age, it ranges from asymptomatic forms with minimal laboratory evidence to acute liver failure and death. The course of Wilson's disease is variable, but it usually becomes chronic, occasionally associated with neurological, renal, hematological, and ocular abnormalities. Diagnosis is based on serum and urine Cooper levels, serum cerulopasmin concentration, and histological examination of the tissues where the metal has been deposited (liver, kidneys, CNS, etc.). Copper chelators (penicillamine, trientene, zinc sulfate) can be given as a bridge to liver transplantation, which is the definitive treatment for this metabolic disorder.

2491,Ultrastructural changes in the gut of rats fed the high-zinc diet,"Feeding people zinc-rich diets is often used as a therapy for patients with Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper accumulation. There do not appear to be any external side effects from this treatment; However, preliminary studies in our laboratory have shown apparent weaknesses in the gut wall of rats fed zinc-rich diets. Consequently, this study was conducted to determine whether feeding zinc-rich diets to rats would affect the ultrastructural morphology of the small intestine. The effects of treatment on the rats' copper status were also determined. Weaned male rats were fed diets containing either 35 or 350 mg zinc/kg. After 7 weeks, blood and various tissues were collected to measure copper status indicators, and portions of the upper duodenum were excised and prepared for light and electron microscopy. The results showed that rats fed the high zinc diet had significantly lower copper status, as indicated by low serum copper, serum ceruloplasmin activity and liver copper, than rats fed the normal zinc diet. Liver superoxide dismutase or cytochrome c oxidase activities were not affected by high zinc levels. Observations of sections of the duodenum by electron microscopy showed that nonassembled collagen molecules of the lamina propria were disorganized and formed tangled masses more frequently in rats fed the high-zinc diet than in those fed the normal zinc diet. This suggests that low copper status, caused by a high zinc diet, could affect the activity of lysyl oxidase, a copper-dependent enzyme, and thus the cross-linking of collagen molecules. However, these observations did not always correlate with low copper status. Other possible explanations include direct competition between zinc and copper for sites on lysyl oxidase, zinc blockage of aldehyde residues on the collagen molecule, or an unrecognized process involving other enzymes or other aspects of collagen assembly. Whether such processes or affinities actually exist is still under investigation.",,"Reeves, P. G.;Newman Jr, S.

To further characterize the biochemical basis of this defect, Western blots of tissue extracts from normal and tx mice were probed with different heavy metal radioisotopes (<sup>63</sup>Ni, <sup>65</sup>Zn and <sup> 64</sup>Cu). It was found that a 30 kDa Ni/Zn-binding polypeptide was markedly reduced in the livers of the tx mice. This protein was isolated from normal adult mice using a method based on Ni-chelate chromatography. The amino acid sequences of two CNBr peptides were identical to portions of the mouse skeletal muscle carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII) sequence. Two other peptides sequenced had closely related sequences to that of CAIII, but with two 45 amino acid differences. These two peptides may be derived from a new CAIII isoform, which we call CAIIIB to distinguish it from the published form CAIIIA. We isolated a cDNA clone corresponding to CAIIIA and used this to show that CAIIIA mRNA was also reduced in the mutant liver but not in muscle. Copper loading of normal mice also decreased hepatic CAIIIA mRNA, suggesting that the decrease in CAIII mRNA in tx mouse liver is a secondary consequence of high hepatic copper levels.",,"Grimes, A.;Paynter, J.;Walker, I.

Related metabolic disorders are mostly due to an imbalance in the water balance and are therefore investigated in connection with disorders of the hydrogen metabolism. Other elements - calcium, phosphorus and magnesium - contribute to bone metabolism under the influence of calcitrophic hormones: parathyroid hormone, calcitonin and 1,25 dihydroxicolecalciferol. Beyond the neonatal stage, the definite diagnosis of hipocalcemia is based on the level of phosphates, parathyroid hormone and vitamin D derivatives to identify the different types of rickets or parathyroid dysfunction. Likewise, the causal identification of hypercalcemia depends on parathyroid function. The so-called microminerals because of their trace presence in the organism play an irreplaceable role in various enzyme functions. Some (iron, iodine) are closely related to certain organic functions (synthesis of hemoglobin and mioglobin or tirotin). Others may suffer from nutritional abnormalities, but perhaps the most serious pathologies stem from genetic predisposition, such as: B.

Appropriate treatment improved symptoms, and maintenance therapy was effective in delaying progression. It is important to consider Wilson's disease in patients with unexplained hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric disorders because appropriate early medical treatment can prevent further organ damage and reduce the risk of permanent damage to the liver and brain.",,"Baban, N.

2508,Extending the adult recipient size limitation in living-donor liver transplantation using an extended right lobe graft,The feasibility of adult-to-adult living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is limited by graft size adequacy. A left lobe graft from a relatively small donor will not meet the metabolic needs of a larger recipient. We report a successful LDLT performed in a 90 kg man using an extended right lobe graft weighing 910 g from his relatively smaller brother. The donor to recipient body weight ratio was only 0.82. The donor did not require a homologous blood transfusion and the donor's recovery was uneventful apart from mild transient hyperbilirubinemia. The graft provided adequate function for the recipient's metabolic needs despite postoperative septic complications. Both the donor and recipient were doing well 4 months after surgery with normal liver function. LDLT using the expanded liver graft in the right lobe of the liver can expand the adult recipient size limit and can be a viable option even when the donor is relatively small compared to the recipient.,,"Lo, C.

2510,Mechanism of excretion of trientine from rat kidney: Trientine is not recognized by the H<sup>+</sup>/organic cation transporter,"Trientine dihydrochloride is used to treat Wilson's disease by chelating copper and increasing its urinary excretion. The mechanism of renal excretion of trientine has been studied in vivo and in vitro. Trientine clearance was significantly faster than creatinine clearance in the rat. However, when trientine and the same number of moles of copper ions were administered to rats simultaneously, trientine clearance decreased to almost the same level as creatinine clearance. To elucidate this active excretion system for trientine, the uptake of trientine and a physiological polyamine compound, spermine, was studied using rat brush border membrane vesicles. Since trientine and spermine are organic cations, the H<sup>+</sup>/organic cation transporter is expected to recognize these compounds, neither an outward H<sup>+</sup> gradient nor an after inward Na< sup>+</sup> gradient-stimulated trientine uptake. However, [<sup>14</sup>C]spermine uptake was transstimulated by both unlabeled spermine and trientine, and the transstimulatory effect of spermine on trientine uptake was further abolished completely by the addition of copper ions to the incubation medium. These results suggest that there is a specific transport system for spermine and trientine on the kidney brush border membrane. This transport system contributes to the secretion of trientine in the renal proximal tubule but does not recognize the trientine-copper complex.",,"Kobayashi, M.;Tanabe, R.;Sugawara, M.;Iseki, K.;Miyazaki, K.",1997,April,,0,0,
2511,Menkes disease: recent advances and new aspects,"Copper is the third most common trace element in the body after iron and zinc and is required for the normal functioning of several important copper enzymes. However, the same element in excess is highly toxic and has harmful effects. Fine regulation of intracellular copper homeostasis is therefore crucial, and disruption of this balance is reflected in two hereditary diseases, Menkes disease and Wilson disease. Remarkable advances have been made in this area in recent years following the isolation of the defective gene in Menkes disease (MD), which will be the focus of this review. Progressive neurodegeneration and connective tissue disorders are the main manifestations of X-linked recessive Menkes disease, and most clinical features can be explained by dysfunction of one or more copper enzymes. The disease site was mapped to Xq13.3 and the gene defective in Menkes disease (MNK) was isolated by positional cloning. The protein product is predicted to be a copper-binding P-type ATPase (ATP7A), the first intracellular copper transporter to be described in eukaryotes. The identification of MNK led to a number of advances in a very short time. The mouse homologue of MNK has been isolated and the allelic relationship between MD and occipital horn syndrome has been confirmed. Most importantly, the gene defective in Wilson's disease was isolated using sequences specific for MNK and the predicted protein product showed high homology to ATP7A. In this review article, we will outline these recent advances and their implications with specific reference to Menkes disease. Wilson's disease is briefly described and the defective copper metabolism in both diseases is summarized in the light of the new findings. Finally, copper translocating ATPases identified in other species and their importance for understanding copper metabolism are discussed.",,"Tumer, Z.;Horn, N.",1997,,,0,0,

2513,"(D)-Penicillamine increases hepatic oxalate production, leading to hyperoxaluria","Purpose: To determine whether (D)-penicillamine is effective in reducing hepatic oxalate production and urinary oxalate excretion. Materials and Methods: (D)-Penicillamine was orally administered to rats to determine its effect on urinary oxalate excretion and used in isolated rat hepatocytes to study the effect of (D)-penicillamine on oxalate production from glycolate. Studies with hepatic aminotransferases and hepatocytes isolated from (D)-penicillamine-treated rats were used to clarify the discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo results. Results: In hepatocytes, (D)-penicillamine leads to a significant reduction in oxalate production from glycolate. In vivo, however, (D)-penicillamine significantly increased urinary oxalate excretion and decreased plasma aminotransferase activity. Hepatic aminotransferases are involved in redirecting oxalate precursors from oxalate production. (D)-Penicillamine has been shown to inhibit hepatic aminotransferases in vitro. Hepatocytes isolated from (D)-penicillamine-treated rats produced significantly more oxalate than controls. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that (D)-penicillamine increases hepatic oxalate production and urinary oxalate excretion. (D)-Penicillamine therefore has no therapeutic potential to reduce endogenous oxalate production and urinary oxalate excretion. In addition, its use may be contraindicated in conditions such as Wilson's disease, often associated with hypercalcuria.",,"Baker, P. W.;Bais, R.;Rofe, A.

The main aim of this report is to emphasize that Wilson's disease must be included in the differential diagnosis of fulminant liver failure in children. Liver transplantation is the only effective treatment for patients with fulminant liver failure, but this procedure is difficult to implement due to insufficient organ donation in Taiwan.

2518,Wilson's disease and idiopathic copper toxicosis,"The causative agent of both Wilson's disease (WD) and non-Indian childhood cirrhosis (which we call idiopathic copper toxicosis, or ICT) is copper, which accumulates in excess in the liver. Inheritance of a pair of alleles of an autosomal recessive gene on chromosome 13 is necessary and sufficient to cause such accumulation of copper in WD; Reducing dietary copper intake does not prevent the development of WD. In contrast, the fatal copper accumulations in children with ICT have been attributed primarily to increased dietary copper intake. However, 64,124 childhood exposures of children under 6 years of age to drinking water with a copper concentration of 125.9 µmol/l (8 mg/l) resulted in no deaths due to any form of liver disease. In addition, the ICT of seven infants was attributed mainly to drinking water < 110.2 mumol Cu/L (7 mg/L), although a genetic defect was identified in three of the patients, one of whom was exclusively breastfed. These data suggest that ICT cannot be caused solely by increased dietary copper intake and occurs only in children with an unidentified genetic defect.",,"Scheinberg, I.

2519,Metal-induced hepatotoxicity,"Figure 3 summarizes several proposed mechanisms of iron- or copper-induced hepatotoxicity. Due to the strong pro-oxidative effects of iron and copper salts in vitro, it has long been suspected that free radicals may play a role in iron- and copper-induced cytotoxicity. In the presence of available cellular reducing agents, iron or copper in low molecular weight forms can play a catalytic role in initiating free radical reactions. The resulting oxyradicals have the potential to damage cell lipids, nucleic acids, proteins and carbohydrates, leading to widespread impairments in cell function and integrity. However, cells are equipped with cytoprotective mechanisms (antioxidants, scavenging enzymes, repair processes) that counteract the effects of free radical production. Thus, the net effect of metal-induced free radicals on cellular function depends on the balance between radical production and cytoprotective systems. As a result, there can be a free radical production rate that must be exceeded before cell damage occurs. Evidence has now accumulated that iron or copper overload in experimental animals can lead to oxidative damage to lipids in vivo once the concentration of the metal exceeds a threshold level. In the liver, this lipid peroxidation is associated with impairment of membrane-dependent functions of mitochondria (oxidative metabolism) and lysosomes (membrane integrity, fluidity, pH). Although these findings do not prove causality, it seems likely that lipid peroxidation is involved since similar functional defects are generated by metal-induced lipid peroxidation in these organelles in vitro. Both iron and copper overload impair hepatic mitochondrial respiration, primarily through a decrease in cytochrome c oxidase activity. With iron overload, hepatocellular calcium homeostasis can be compromised by damaging mitochondrial and microsomal calcium sequestration. It has also been reported that DNA is a target of metal-induced damage in the liver; this can have consequences in terms of malignant transformation. Liver levels of some antioxidants are decreased in iron- or copper-overloaded rats, also suggesting sustained oxidative stress. Reduced cellular ATP levels, lysosomal fragility, impaired cellular calcium homeostasis, and DNA damage can all contribute to hepatocellular damage in iron and copper overload. There is little data addressing the key question of whether tree radical production is increased in patients with iron or copper overload. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis have elevated plasma levels of TBA reactants and elevated hepatic levels of MDA protein and HNE protein adducts, indicating lipid peroxidation. Mitochondria isolated from the livers of patients with Wilson's disease indicate lipid peroxidation, and some patients with Wilson's disease have decreased liver and plasma levels of vitamin E. Additional investigations are needed to fully assess oxidative stress and its potential pathophysiological role in patients with iron or copper overload.",,"Britton, R. S.",1996,,,0,0,

2521,Inhibition of hereditary hepatitis and liver tumor development in Long Evans cinnamon rats by the copper chelating agent trientine dihydrochloride,"Trientine dihydrochloride (Trientine) is an alternative medicinal copper chelating agent for patients with Wilson's disease or penicillamine intolerance. We studied the effects of trientine on the spontaneous development of hepatitis and liver tumors by its short-term and long-term administration to Long. Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats with hepatic copper accumulation as animal models of Wilson's disease. Male rats were administered trientine in their drinking water at 1500 ppm for 18 weeks from 6 weeks of age to 24 weeks of short term and 1500 pores for 27 weeks, then 750 ppm for 52 weeks from 8 to 87 weeks of age in long term. The development of hepatitis was observed in the control LEC rats at 18 weeks of age. They had high concentrations of plasma transaminases (glutamic acid-oxaloacetic acid transaminase [GOT], glutamic acid-pyruvate transaminase [GPT]) and hepatocyte destruction was observed on pathological examination. Histological findings showed that short-term administration of trientine markedly inhibited the development of hepatitis. The plasma GOT and GPT levels of the treated animals were only slightly higher than those of normal LEA rats (long-evans with agouti coat color), a sibling of LEC rats. The copper level in the liver was reduced by a maximum of 50%. With long-term administration of trientine, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the treated rats was 67% that of the untreated LEC rats, and the number of HCCs per rat in the treated group was 0.7 +/- 0.5. significantly lower compared to 4.7 +/- 3.5 in the untreated rats. In addition, the development of cholangiofibrosis in LEC rats was completely prevented by long-term administration of the drug. Liver copper levels in treated rats were reduced by 33% at 87 weeks of age. The development of HCC in LEC rats may be partially, but not entirely, due to copper accumulation. No effects were noted on the levels of copper, iron or zinc in the liver of LEA rats, and no adverse effects were noted in either LEC or LEA rats after short-term and long-term administration of trientine in the drinking water.",,"Sone, H.;Maeda, M.;Wakabayashi, K.;Takeichi, N.;Mori, M.;Sugimura, T.;Nagao, M.",1996,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1053/jhep.1996.v23.pm0008666330,0,0,

The purpose of the study was to describe the range of abnormalities seen on cranial MR images of patients with Wilson's disease and the findings with clinical severity, disease duration and duration of neurological signs and symptoms before treatment to correlate. In these patients with serial studies, changes on MR images were compared to clinical response. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Brain MR imaging was performed in 25 patients with Wilson's disease using conventional spin-echo sequences (n = 25), phase maps (n = 8), and partially refocused nested multiple-echo sequences (n = 5). RESULTS. MR imaging findings were abnormal in 22 patients and normal in three patients. The basal ganglia were interpreted as abnormal in 19 (86%) of 22 patients, involving the putamen in 19 (86%), the thalami in 12 (54%), the tail head in 10 (45%), and the globus pallidus in nine (41%). We found a predilection for involvement of the outer rim of the putamen and the ventral nuclear mass of the thalami. The claustrum was abnormal in three patients. The midbrain was abnormal in 17 (77%) of these 22 patients, affecting mainly the tegmentum but also the substantia nigra, red nuclei, inferior tectum, and crura. The pons was abnormal in 18 (82%) of 22 patients and the cerebellum was abnormal in 11 patients (50%), involving the upper middle cerebellar peduncles. Atrophy was present in 18 (82%) of 22 patients and cortical white matter changes were evident in 13 (59%) of 22 patients. Scan of an untreated patient showed a reduction in T1 relaxation time in the thalami, consistent with the paramagnetic effects of copper. Phase maps and partially refocused nested multiple-echo sequences performed in eight and five patients, respectively, and used to reveal an iron- or copper-induced susceptibility change showed normal findings. We found an inverse significance relationship between the severity but not the magnitude of the change in signal intensity and duration of untreated disease (p=0.030) and total disease duration (p=0.015). The study group was too small to show a correlation with clinical findings. The changes seen on MR images were consistent with the clinical response to treatment in only two of the seven patients who participated in follow-up studies. CONCLUSION. MR imaging showed abnormalities in the basal ganglia, white matter, midbrain, pons and cerebellum. The paramagnetic effect of copper has only been found in untreated patients. Patients with longer disease duration showed less pronounced changes in signal intensity. MR imaging was of limited value in follow-up.",,"King, A. D.;Walshe, J. M.;Kendall, B. E.;Chinn, R. J.

Female LEC rats were intraperitoneally injected with TTM at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight for 8 consecutive days. More than 2/3 of the Cu accumulating in the liver was removed by the TTM treatment 24 h after the last injection. Although most Cu was bound to MT in the soluble fraction prior to TTM treatment, the Cu remaining in the liver was almost exclusively present in the insoluble fraction along with molybdenum (Mo). Cu,Zn,Cd-MT was separated from the liver of LEC rats injected with cadmium (Cd) and treated with TTM in molar ratios of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 to 10 Cu bonded to MT converted min at 37 degrees. When TTM was added in a molar ratio less than 1.0, a Cu,Zn,Cd-MT/TTM complex was detected, while the addition of TTM in a molar ratio greater than 1.0 selectively removed Cu from MT and a Cu/TTM generated complex via the release of Zn,Cd-MT from the Cu,Zn,Cd-MT/TTM complex. Excess TTM appeared to facilitate the polymerization of the Cu/TTM complex into insoluble polymers.

We report on six Aboriginal Canadian children with severe chronic cholestatic liver disease who had excess hepatic copper and zinc. methods. The children, aged 22 months to 8 years, were from northern Ontario, Canada. All were referred for possible liver transplantation because of end-stage liver disease. We examined explanted liver specimens (or liver biopsy material in one case) by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) X-ray elemental microanalysis and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Samples from four controls (two with no liver pathology, one with biliary atresia and one with Wilson's disease) were also analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results. The explanted livers showed similar clear signs of advanced biliary cirrhosis, and electron microscopy showed dense deposits in enlarged lysosomes and cytoplasm. The hepatic copper concentrations in the five patients with measurements were several times higher (47.6-56.9 µg/g dry weight) than in two samples of normal control liver tissue (2.3 and 2.9 µg/g). Similarly, hepatic zinc concentrations were several-fold higher in patients than controls (104-128 vs. 1.9-3.2 mg/g dry weight). Interpretation. The copper excess may be due to chronic cholestasis, but the zinc excess is unexplained. Since three of the patients are related (common grandparents), a genetic disorder of metal metabolism is possible, but we cannot rule out environmental factors.",,"Phillips, M. J.;Ackerley, C.

The rCMRGlc was determined in the basal ganglia, the thalamus, the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar hemispheres. The severity of neurological symptoms, defined by semiquantitative motor impairment scores, correlated strongly (r = -0.80) with the reduction in striatal rCMRGlc. clinical. Scores, striatal rCMRGlc and the grade of MRI abnormalities showed no correlation with various indices of dopamine D2 receptor binding. Sequential PET measurements in three patients during treatment with chelating agents showed a moderate increase in striatal rCMRGlc (in two patients) and a moderate to significant increase in striatal D2 receptor binding (in three patients) associated with clinical improvement. Our data suggest that the rCMRGlc is a sensitive and objective measure to assess and monitor striatal and extrastriatal involvement in WM. The lack of correlation between dopamine D2 receptor binding and striatal rCMRGlc and structural abnormalities can be explained by the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and differential response to treatment in WM patients.",,"Schlaug, G.;Hefter, H.;Engelbrecht, V.;Kuwert, T.;Arnold, S.;Stocklin, G.;Seitz, R.

The arsenic resistance efflux system transports arsenite [As(III)], alternatively using either a double polypeptide ATPase (ArsA and ArsB) or a single polypeptide (ArsB) that function as a chemiosmotic transporter. The third gene in the arsenic resistance system, arsC, encodes an enzyme that converts intracellular arsenate [As(V)] to arsenite [As(III)], the substrate of the efflux system. The triple polypeptide Czc (Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>2+</sup>) chemiosmotic efflux pump consists of an inner membrane (CzcA), outer membrane (CzcC) and membrane-spanning (CzcB) proteins, which work together to transport cations from the cytoplasm through the periplasmic space to the outside of the cell.",,"Silver, S.",1996,2022-11-07 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119%2896%2900323-X,0,0,

The mean treatment cycles with zinc were 3.62 +/- 0.94 years and the effective rate was 58.8%. At the same time, the urinary copper excretions of the penicillamine-treated group were apparently higher than that of the zinc-treated group (P<0.01). Conclusions: The efficacy of treatment with penicillamine was superior to zinc therapy.

The results showed that the Vocable IQ (VIQ), Performance IQ (PIQ), and Full IQ (FIQ) of HLD patients were significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.005), particularly in the case of visual impairment, indicating that the Copper ion deposition in the patient's brain not only damaged neuronal motor functions but also produced a marked effect on the patient's intelligence. After treatment, the overall intelligence level including VIQ, PIQ and FIQ was increased, especially in PIQ where all scores were obviously increased (P<0.001). It was also shown that intelligence damage in HLD patients became more severe as the disease progressed, and early treatment allowed IQ levels to approach normal criterion.

[Japanese]","The disposition behavior of trientine, a selective copper chelating drug for Wilson's disease, and its metabolites in normal Wilson's disease patients and rats was studied. High levels of metabolites occurred in blood samples from patients and rats in the early stages after administration of trientine. In addition, large amounts of trientine metabolites were excreted in the urine of the patients. These results suggest that trientine is remarkably subject to a first-pass effect. The drug concentration area under the curve (AUC) of unchanged form and metabolites of trientine in patients was not dependent on the administered dose. It seems that the absorption process is an important factor for the dispositional behavior of trientine, we also studied the uptake properties of trientine through brush border membrane vesicles of rat intestine. The uptake properties of trientine were similar to those of the physiological polyamines spermine and spermidine. The uptake rate of trientine was dose-dependently inhibited by spermine and spermidine. In addition, spermine competitively inhibited the uptake of trientine with a Ki value of 18.6 mM. This value is very close to the Km value for spermine (30.4 mM). These data suggested that the mechanism of uptake of trientine in rat small intestinal brush border membrane vesicles was almost identical to that of spermine and spermidine and that the physiological polyamines appear to have the ability to inhibit the absorption of trientine from the gastrointestinal tract.",,"Tanabe, R.",1996,Mar,,0,0,

Mice and rats received triene-2HCl in the drinking water at concentrations of 0, 120, 600 or 3000 ppm for up to 92 days. Twenty mice and 18 rats of each sex were assigned to each dose group fed either a grain-based (NIH-31) or purified (AIN-76A) diet, both of which contained nutritionally adequate amounts of copper. An additional control group of rats and mice received a Cu-deficient AIN-76A diet. This copper-poor diet resulted in Cu deficiency symptoms such as anemia, liver periportal cytomegaly, pancreatic atrophy and multifocal necrosis, splenic hematopoietic cell proliferation, and increased heart weight, along with undetectable plasma copper levels in rats but not in mice. Triene-2HCl somewhat decreased plasma copper levels (at 600 and 3000 ppm) in rats fed the AIN-76A diet, but did not induce the usual signs of copper deficiency. Triene-2HCl caused increased uterine dilatation in rats fed the AIN-76A diet at 3000 ppm, which was not seen in females fed the Cu-deficient diet. Triene-2HCl toxicity occurred only in mice in the highest dose group fed an AIN-76A diet. An increased incidence of pulmonary interstititis and periportal fatty infiltration of the liver was observed in both sexes, and hematopoietic cell proliferation was observed in the spleen of males. Kidney and body weights were reduced in men, as was the incidence of renal cytoplasmic vacuolation. There were no signs of copper deficiency in mice exposed to triene-2HCl.

Changes in molybdenum (Mo) and Cu concentrations and their biological forms in the serum of LEC rats determined at different time points after a single intraperitoneal injection were compared to those of (normal) Wistar rats. The change in serum Mo concentration in normal rats was monophasic, while in LEC rats it was biphasic. The phase in normal rats and the first phase in LEC rats appeared to reflect the process of uptake and disappearance of TTM in the livers of Wistar and LEC rats. On the other hand, the second phase in LEC rats paralleled the changes in Cu and appeared to reflect complex formation (Cu/thiomolybdate complex) between Mo and liver-accumulated Cu. The complex was specifically bound to albumin as determined by high performance liquid chromatography with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC/ICP-MS).

Excretion via urine and faeces was also examined. Liver disposition of Mo was dramatically increased in LEC rats, suggesting that the interaction of TTM with Cu results in enhanced Mo uptake. The concentrations of Mo and Cu decreased over time in the liver of LEC rats, while those in the spleen increased. Although the Mo concentration taken up by the kidneys decreased over time after an initial increase in both rats, the Cu concentration increased over time. Cu was not redistributed to the brain. The urinary excretion of Mo was reduced in LEC rats compared to Wistar rats and excretion in the faeces was increased. These results indicate that TTM is taken up by the liver in a manner dependent on the Cu content, and that the Cu and Mo removed from the liver are largely excreted in the faeces. Redistribution of Cu was observed in the spleen and kidneys but not in the brain.",,"Ogra, Y.;Ohmichi, M.;Suzuki, K. T.",1995,,,0,0,

Wilson's disease was only diagnosed after regression of the acute renal failure based on the copper excretion in the urine (2890 µg/day, increase to 7330 µg/day after administration of D-penicillamine). Progressive liver failure required a transplant. The patient then recovered quickly and is now, two years later, symptom-free.

It has also been reported in children with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. A case of IgA nephropathy associated with cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease is reported. Case Report: A 10-year-old girl was admitted for cirrhosis. She had suffered from ascitis and hematuria since she was 6 years old and from vascular purpura for 6 months since she was 9 years old. On admission she had atrophic cirrhosis, ascitis, splenomegaly, and petechiae on the legs. Microcytic anemia was present due to iron deficiency. The Coombs test was positive. There was hypoalbuminemia (2 g/dl) and polyclonal hyperglobulinemia (IgA 750 mg/dl, IgG 1670 mg/dl and IgM 250 mg/dl). Her serum levels of complement factors were normal and no serum immune complexes were detected. She also showed biological changes due to renal failure, hematuria and proteinuria. A liver biopsy showed micronodular cirrhosis with numerous IgA-containing plasma cells. A search for an etiology revealed ceruloplasmin levels of 5 mg/dl, increased urinary copper excretion (>150 µg/day) and above normal liver copper (255 µg/g dry weight); Kayser-Fleischer-Ring was also seen. Kidney biopsy showed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence microscopy showed C3 and IgA in the mesangial and subendothelial regions. The patient received spironolactone and furosemide followed by triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride. Conclusions: The IgA nephropathy, vascular purpura and elevated serum IgA levels could be due to the liver changes.

Early treatment with penicillamine has been found to reduce mortality and reverse liver damage. Our aim was to define the clinical features of copper-associated liver disease outside the Indian subcontinent and to promote earlier consideration of the syndrome in cryptogenic liver disease. METHODS: Three European children, aged 10 to 29 months, presented with abdominal distension, pyrexia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Over 1-5 weeks, her condition deteriorated rapidly due to liver failure. Two died within 2 months of onset and one received a successful liver transplant. In two cases, the diagnosis was only considered when the liver was examined after orthotopic liver transplantation or death. Light microscopy with hematoxylin and eosin, reticulin and orcein stains was used. Tissue, plasma and water copper levels were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: All had micronodular cirrhosis and severe hepatocellular necrosis with Mallory bodies and abundant orcein-positive material. Liver copper concentrations ranged from 1100-1310 cups/g dry weight. Tap water with a high copper content was used for the preparation of food in two patients. In the third case, no environmental source of excess copper could be identified. Conclusions: We suggest that the above condition, referred to as Indian childhood cirrhosis in the Indian subcontinent and copper storage disease elsewhere, should be better referred to as ""copper-associated childhood liver disease"" to emphasize the need to exclude this disorder in unexplained liver disease in to consider and look for possible sources of excessive copper intake.",,"Baker, A.;Gormally, S.;Saxena, R.;Baldwin, D.;Drumm, B.;Bonham, J.;Portmann, B.;Mowat, A.

2557,Wilson's disease. Development panorama of diagnosis and treatment in the last forty years. [Japanese],"In 1912, Wilson and Fleischer independently reported autopsied patients with progressive neurological disorder associated with liver cirrhosis, and they suggested that the syndrome might be a specific disease of toxic origin. In 1952, Scheinberg demonstrated a lack of serum ceruloplasmin in Wilson's disease, and it became possible to diagnose the disease while the patient was still asymptomatic. In 1956, Walshe introduced penicillamine as the best drug to treat the disease. These groundbreaking discoveries encouraged Japanese doctors to diagnose early and try to prevent the disease. This lecture aimed to review the changing panorama in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of the disease over a period of forty years, with a focus on the experience in Japan. The early detection of the patients based on hypoceruloplasminemia enabled the investigation of the age at the onset of a GOT or GPT increase in the serum and the occurrence of Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings. Previously, the youngest patients with high GPT scores and KF rings were three and five years old, respectively. It became popular that an unexpected elevation in serum transaminases in apparently healthy children as young as three years of age prompted investigation of the possibility of Wilson's disease and that an increasing number of non-familial patients in late infancy was noted. Now mass screening for Wilson's disease is underway. Prophylactic follow-up studies spanning more than 30 years clearly demonstrated that continued penicillamine therapy prevented the onset of clinical symptoms. There were patients who, after interrupting therapy for several years, developed symptoms such as haemolytic crisis, motor deterioration and, in particular, psychotic or affective disorders between the ages of twenty and thirty.

The incidence of hepatitis A is regularly decreasing thanks to the significant improvement in sanitation. The anti-HAV vaccine has recently become available and is effective in almost 100% of cases. Hepatitis B is a major public health problem. A quarter to a third of chronic carriers acquired this infection in infancy or childhood, constituting a huge virus reservoir. Hepatitis B is associated with severe morbidity and mortality (fulminant hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocarcinoma). Systematic vaccination is recommended. Pediatric chronic carriers may benefit from alpha interferon therapy. Hepatitis B is usually limited to several risk groups and tends to be chronic. Materno-fetal transmission is described. Other known or unknown viruses can cause hepatitis, such as B. Severe sporadic childhood NANBNC hepatitis, which can be complicated by bone marrow aplasia.

2560,liver diseases. Functions and corresponding management,"The spectrum of liver disease is extremely broad, with many of the underlying conditions having both acute and chronic manifestations. Most of the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are explained by autoimmune diseases, viral infections and toxic insults. The treatment strategy for any liver disease is a combination of management of the symptoms and complications that arise and drug therapies relevant to the specific underlying diagnosis. Encephalopathy, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, variceal bleeding, and pruritus are the major complications targeted by drug therapy, although in some cases they represent only one aspect of the overall treatment. Drug therapy by itself is largely ineffective for acute liver failure, with the possible exception of acetylcysteine, but many drugs are used to treat the components of this complex medical emergency. Treatments for certain liver diseases are increasing, particularly in the areas of autoimmune and viral diseases. The increasing availability and success of liver transplantation has tended to change the focus of management, and it is often inappropriate to exhaust treatment options before referring the patient for transplantation.

Recognition of the entity of fulminant Wilson's hepatitis is important because timely liver transplantation improves survival. Methods: Retrospective case analysis with regard to the characteristic profile of standard laboratory parameters and the clinical course of acute Wilson's liver failure. RESULTS: In two female patients (ages 17 and 27 years) with non-autoimmune hemolysis, serum AST and ALT levels were only moderately elevated with markedly decreased ALT activity and relatively low serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) Reflect. Despite immediate administration of D-penicillamine, one patient died as a result of multi-organ failure. CONCLUSION: In fulminant Wilson's liver failure, the AP/bilirubin ratio is usually less than 2.

2564,"Impaired copper metabolism in LEC rats, an animal model of Wilson's disease: roles of metallothionein","The impaired copper (Cu) metabolism in LEC rats, an animal model of Wilson's disease, was characterized by the specification of Cu in the liver, bloodstream and kidneys during the accumulation process and at the onset of jaundice; Cu accumulates in the liver with increasing age in the form bound to metallothionein (MT). Massive Cu is released from MT as Cu accumulates beyond the capacity of MT synthesis. Cu bound to MT is not supplied to ceruloplasmin (Cp) during its maturation process, while the metal is directly transferred from MT to Cu, zinc (Zn) superoxide dismutase (SOD). Cu ions not bound to MT are transferred to Cp, and the holo-Cp is excreted into the bloodstream near and at the onset of jaundice. Cu accumulated in the liver in a form bound to MT is selectively removed by tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) and the animal recovers at the onset of jaundice onset by chelation therapy. It has been suggested that mechanisms of the removal reaction involve the formation of MT/TTM, Cu/TTM, and/or polymeric Cu/TTM complexes according to the stoichiometry of TTM to Cu. It was assumed that the Cu/TTM complex is shed into the blood stream and binds specifically to albumin. TTM is taken up by the liver according to the Cu content.

The copper concentrations in the liver were 392 and 194 µg/g in Fischer and LEC rats that were not treated with TTM. However, the hepatic MT concentration in the LEC rats was about 10-fold higher than in the Fischer rats. In Fischer rats, bile and serum Cu excretion was increased by TTM, resulting in a decrease in hepatic Cu concentration (264 µg/g). In LEC rats, Cu leakage into the serum but not biliary Cu excretion was accelerated by TTM injection. The increased serum Cu concentration was 0.7 µg/ml in LEC rats compared to 14.4 µg/ml in Fischer rats. The hepatic Cu concentration was 170 µg/g in LEC rats treated with TTM. Serum ceruloplasmin activity (as oxidase) in LEC rats was not increased by injection of TTM. Our results suggest that TTM can remove Cu from the liver via the blood and that Cu metabolism in LEC rats differs from that in Cu-fed rats.",,"Sugawara, N.;Yuasa, M.;Sugawara, C.",1995,,,0,0,

Liver biopsy could often not be performed in MM because of severe hemostasis disorders. The aim of the study was: a) to demonstrate our 9 patients with different forms of WD. b) examine some blood coagulation factors and compare the results with those in other liver diseases. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made because of a disturbed copper metabolism. Among our 9 patients (8 women and 1 man, between 17-33 years old) we diagnosed: 3 patients with fulminant Wilson's disease with all-day deep jaundice, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhagic diathesis and liver failure, died, 2 patients with active chronic hepatitis, hemolytic Anemia and hemorrhagic diathesis, 2 patients with liver cirrhosis, hemorrhagic diathesis, Kayser-Fleisher ring, neuropsychiatric syndrome, 2 asymptomatic patients without hemorrhagic diathesis.

The compounds studied were as follows: tris(2-aminoethyl)amine.3HCl (TREN), tetraethylenepentamine.5HCl (TETREN), pentaethylenehexamine.6HCl (PENTEN), 1,4,7,11-tetraazaundecane.4HCl (TAUD), 1 ,5,8,12-Tetraazadodecane.4HCl (TADD), 1-N-Benzyltriethylenetetramine.HCl (BzTT), 4,7,10,13-Tetraazatridecanoic acid.2H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4 < /inf> (TTPA), 1,10-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazadecane.4HCl (BPTETA) and N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-4-(aminomethyl)benzoic acid (4ABA). Of these, BzTT, TTPA, and 4ABA are new chelating agents that have not been previously reported. The factors by which these chelating agents enhanced copper excretion over control (untreated) levels were as follows: DPA, 7.2; TREN, 1.6; TRIEN, 4.0; TETRANES, 10.1; pentene, 7.8; TAUD, 7.8; TADD, 2.6; TTPA, 5.6; BzTT, 1.8; and 4ABA, 5.5.

MT containing Cu and cadmium (Cd) (Cu,Cd-MT) was reacted with TTM in a molar ratio of TTM/Cu=0.5. A complex containing Cu, Cd and molybdenum (Mo) was formed and migrated to a position corresponding to an MT dimer on a gel filtration column.

Ionic Cu (copper(I) and copper(II) ions) was incorporated more efficiently than the metal bound to metallothionein. Cu binds not only to the Cu binding site but also to the Zn binding site. Although Zn in the reaction medium and the metal bound to the Zn-binding site of SOD little affected the reactivity upon binding ionic Cu, they interfered with the reactivity of metallothionein-bound Cu at the Cu-binding site. Both ionic and metallothionein-bound Zn were transferred to the Zn binding site but not to the Cu binding site with comparable efficiency. Coexisting ionic Cu but no Cu bound to metallothionein in the medium inhibited the binding of Zn to SOD.

2579,Copper metabolism leading to and after acute hepatitis in LEC rats,"The process of accumulation of copper (Cu) in the liver and the consequent metabolic disorder of Cu were studied in LEC rats, a mutant strain that accumulates Cu with age and shows spontaneous acute hepatitis and/or hepatoma. The Cu concentration in the liver of female rats was ~220 µg/g liver at the age of 2 weeks, decreased to 100 µg/g liver after 4-6 weeks and then began linearly with age up to the highest concentration of 250 µg/g to rise g liver at 16 weeks. Although the Cu content, expressed as concentration (mg/g liver), decreased during weaning, it increased linearly with age when expressed as content (mg/liver), indicating a constant and preferential accumulation of Cu in the liver indicates. After 16 weeks, the concentration of Cu in the liver stopped increasing, followed by a sudden drop to half of the highest level. Biological markers (serum lactate dehydrogenase and glutamic acid oxaloacetic transaminase activities) for liver damage began to increase along with the appearance of signs of jaundice when Cu reached the highest concentration. Distributions of Cu and zinc (Zn) in the supernatant fraction of the liver indicated that both metals were distributed mainly to metallothionein (MT) and to a small extent to superoxide dismutase on a gel filtration column over the course of the experiments. The serum Cu concentration began to increase in the form of ceruloplasmin along with serum marker enzyme activities for liver damage. The Cu concentration in the kidneys also started to increase after the increase in serum Cu. The results show that Cu in the form of MT accumulates in the liver of LEC rats to a maximum of ~250 µg/g liver and then abruptly decreases with the onset of acute hepatitis. The maximum level appears to be related to the capacity of MT synthesis, and acute hepatitis is believed to occur when Cu accumulates beyond capacity. Serum Cu began to rise from the abnormally low level as the metal accumulated beyond the capacity of MT synthesis in the liver, partially reabsorbed by the kidneys and the remainder excreted in the urine. Changes in iron and zinc levels were determined and discussed in relation to those of Cu.",,"Suzuki, K. T.;Kanno, S.;Misawa, S.;Aoki, Y.",1995,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0300-483X%2894%2902927-M,0,0,

2584,"Copper: Not too little, not too much, but just right","Copper is an essential trace element with a well-established mechanism for maintaining metal balance in the body, controlled by at least two genes. Disruption of a gene on the X chromosome determines a defect in the process of copper absorption with consequent lack of available copper at the cellular level. This leads to abnormalities in collagen formation and brain maturation, leading to early death. So far there is no effective treatment. Disruption of the other copper-controlling gene, located on chromosome 13, is linked to the accumulation of excess copper in the body, first in the liver, causing cirrhosis, and then in the brain, leading to the destruction of the motor control center and , frequent personality changes. Excess copper can also cause kidney damage, osteoarticular changes, and joint pain. If the renal lesion results in urinary calcium loss and other tubular defects, osteoporosis or, occasionally, osteomalacia with pathologic fractures may be present. In this disease, the abnormal copper stores can be mobilized with chelating agents or depleted by the administration of zinc salts or thiomolybdate. This usually, but not always, results in an improvement or even complete reversal of symptoms. Brain lesions, as detected by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, may also resolve. The mechanism of this phenomenon is unclear, but suggests that the long-held doctrine that there is no central nervous system recovery may need to be revised.",,"Walshe, J. M.",1995,,,0,0,

Patients with neurological disorders had behavioral and extrapyramidal manifestations such as dystonia and parkinsonism. Patients responded well to penicillamine, with the exception of 3 patients who died from liver complications and in whom treatment was delayed or discontinued.

[German],"To demonstrate that Wilson's disease is a likely cause of multiple low-intensity hepatic nodules, we obtained MR images of 16 patients with clinically and histopathologically confirmed Wilson's disease. According to the morphological changes, MRI allowed the patients to be divided into two groups. Using a T2-weighted spin-echo sequence (TR/TE = 2000/45-90), the liver parenchyma in 10 of 16 patients showed multiple tiny low-intensity nodules surrounded by high-intensity septa. 5 patients also had low intensity nodules on T<inf>1</inf>-weighted images (TR/TE = 600/20). In patients in this group, histopathology revealed liver cirrhosis (n=7) and fibrosis (n=2). The common feature of this group of patients was a pronounced inflammatory cell infiltration in fibrous septa, an increase in the copper concentration in the liver parenchyma and significant pathological changes in the laboratory data. In the remaining 6 patients, no pathologic change in liver morphology was detected by MRI, consistent with mild histopathologic changes in the parenchyma and normal laboratory data. Because low-intensity nodules surrounded by high-intensity septa can be detected in patients with extensive inflammatory infiltration of the hepatic parenchyma, MRI can help define Wilson patients with poorer prognosis. In patients with low-intensity liver nodules and unknown cause of cirrhosis, laboratory data and histopathology should be reviewed when looking for disorders of copper metabolism.",,"Vogl, T.

The concentrations of hepatic Cu (100 µg/g) and metallothionein (MT)-bound Cu (from 2,600 to 540 µg/g protein) were greatly reduced by the injection. In contrast, the renal Cu concentration increased significantly, but the brain Cu concentration only very slightly. The reduction in hepatic Cu concentration was accompanied by a reduction in Zn and Fe concentrations in liver, kidney and brain. The TTM compound slightly stimulated the secretion (about 3-fold) of Cu into the bile but strongly (about 40-fold) into the blood. In rats not treated with TTM, most biliary (100%) and serum (78%) Cu was recovered in the trichloroacetic acid (TCA) soluble fraction. On the other hand, in rats treated with TTM, bile and serum Cu was predominantly recovered in the TCA-insoluble fraction, probably in the form of a Cu-TTM-albumin complex. Our results suggest that although the intrinsic secretion process of Cu from the liver inherently fails in LEC rats, the TTM compound can remove Cu from Cu-MT, resulting in a decrease in hepatic Cu.",,"Sugawara, N.;Li, D.;Sugawara, C.",1994,,,0,0,

These drugs include neuroleptics, amantadine, diazepam, primidone, selegiline, and reserpine. Pregnancy may unmask a pre-existing potential for chorea (ie, chorea gravidarum) and often has a mildly aggravating effect on the symptoms of PD; however, it has little impact on other movement disorders.

No consistent significant correlations were found between copper metabolism and pyramidal tract function tested by magnetic brain stimulation. An improvement in CCTs and response amplitudes was observed with copper elimination therapy only in the early phases of therapy. There was no correlation with duration of therapy or neurological symptoms. Thus, magnetic brain stimulation is proving sensitive to detect subclinical impairment of the pyramidal tract in WD, but appears to test too specific an aspect of motor impairment in WD to reflect the patients' overall neurological status.

2599,Liver disease and psychiatric disorders: relationships and treatment,"link between liver disease and psychiatric symptoms has long been speculated. While liver detoxification renders the exogenous substances harmless to the body, sometimes the liver converts a harmless substance into a more toxic substance. With such an important role, the liver protects all organs of the body. In liver dysfunction, toxic metabolites can be produced that damage the brain. Since the brain has a high blood supply, a large amount of metabolites reach this organ. Therefore, the metabolic function of the liver maintains a delicate interrelationship between the two organs. In addition, a number of psychotropic drugs affect liver function. Another puzzling clinical problem is the difficulty of managing psychiatric symptoms in patients with liver disease. For example, benzodiazepines, which do not affect liver function in physically fit psychiatric patients, can induce hepatic coma in patients with liver disease. Benzodiazepine antagonists produce a dramatic and transient improvement in patients with hepatic coma. Clinically, many psychoactive drugs lead to hepatic complications. The same drugs that produce hepatic side effects are required to treat psychiatric symptoms in patients with liver disease. Properly dealing with these situations requires a thorough knowledge of the side effects of these drugs.",,"Ananth, J.;Swartz, R.;Burgoyne, K.;Gadasally, R.",1994,,,0,0,

2601,"Wilson's disease. Physiopathology, therapeutic approach and clinical contribution. [Italian]","Wilson disease is a hereditary recessive autosomal disorder affecting approximately five people per million population. The primary defect is localized in the liver and the disease is manifested by the accumulation of copper in the tissues. The decrease in ceruloplasmin, which until a few years ago was mistaken for the pathogenetic cause of Wilson's disease, is a concomitant phenomenon of the underlying metabolic defect characterized by defective biliary copper excretion. There are four stages in the natural history of the disease: 1) an asymptomatic stage of hepatic copper accumulation; 2) release and redistribution of copper leading to hepatocellular necrosis and hemolysis; 3) extrahepatic accumulation of copper leading to the occurrence of cirrhosis and neurological damage; 4) Stage of homeostasis after treatment but with possible irreversible neurological damage. Treatment of Wilson's disease takes the form of pharmacological, dietary and surgical therapy. By forming copper and protein-metal complexes, D-penicillamine depletes copper deposits, reducing or eliminating hepatic and neurological symptoms; a small percentage of treated patients develop nephrotic syndrome requiring forced drug discontinuation. In this case, triethylenetetramine dichloridate (TETA) is a valid alternative, which induces increased cupemia during cupruresis. The earlier the treatment is started and the more regularly it is administered, the better the response to pharmacological treatment. The dietary intake of copper must be reduced, at the same time foods with a high copper content must be avoided. Liver transplantation appears to ""resolve"" the underlying metabolic problem in patients who develop fulminant hepatitis with hypercuperemia and hemolysis, and of course in cases of uncompensated cirrhosis unresponsive to Kelating therapy.

2602,Development of neurological symptoms in a patient with asymptomatic Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine,"Aim: To report a case of pre-symptomatic Wilson's disease in a patient who developed severe neurological disability after treatment with penicillamine and to discuss alternative initial therapy for such patients. Theme: Case Report. The patient described is briefly compared to a previously studied group of 13 similar pre-symptomatic patients who received zinc therapy without any clinical deterioration and who were followed up for 3 to 9 years. Setting: referral hospital. Patients: The patient was referred to us. Intervention: The patient had initially been treated with penicillamine. Main Outcome Parameters: The main outcome of interest is permanent neurological disability, dependent on the type of initial treatment. Results: The result of initial penicillamine therapy in the patient described is permanent neurological disability. This is thought to be due to the mobilization and redistribution of hepatic copper, leading to high levels of copper in key areas of the brain. Conclusion: We conclude that penicillamine used as initial therapy, even in patients with neurologically asymptomatic Wilson's disease, increases the risk of causing permanent neurological damage.",,"Brewer, G.

Eleven patients (6 males, 5 females) between the ages of 11 and 50 years with a disease duration of 5 months to 32 years underwent MRI with a 1.5 T system. Three patients were asymptomatic, two had mild neurological disorders, two were moderately affected, and the remaining four had severe disease. All were receiving D-penicillamine at the time of the study. The patients with the most symptoms had abnormalities at five or more MRI sites. The putamen was affected in all symptomatic patients, including five with dystonia. The peripheral localization of signal-rich putaminal lesions on T2-weighted images was striking. In five cases, lesions in the corpus striatum or in the substantia nigra explained the patient's parkinsonian features.

We report on a healthy 17-year-old girl who presented with renal colic and a subsequently passed distal ureteral stone. The patient was hospitalized 2 months later with jaundice, ascites, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and elevated liver enzymes. She was hypophosphatemic and hypouricaemic with low serum ceruloplasmin. The diagnosis was Wilson's disease with Fanconi syndrome, but despite penicillamine therapy and intensive care, rapidly progressive liver failure, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy developed. The patient died before the emergency liver transplant. Our case illustrates the role urologists can play in diagnosing this rare but potentially treatable disease.

2609,Direct transfer of copper from metallothionein to superoxide dismutase: A possible mechanism for differential delivery of Cu to SOD and ceruloplasmin in LEC rats,"Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn)-binding superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) is always synthesized in the form of a holoprotein in the liver of LEC rats, a genetically defective mutant strain in Cu metabolism that accumulates Cu in a form bound to Metallothionein (MT). On the other hand, ceruloplasmin (Cp) is synthesized in the liver and excreted mainly as apo protein into blood plasma before the onset of acute hepatitis and then in holoform at the onset of jaundice. Thus, Cu is delivered differently between Cp and SOD and at different times, ie before and at the onset of acute hepatitis. The availability of Cu for apo-SOD was studied to explain the mechanisms for the differential supply of Cu between three different forms of Cu; i) copper(I) ion bound to glutathione, ii) free copper(I) ion, and iii) copper(I) ion bound to MT. Cu was transferred to SOD from the three Cu complexes, although MT-bound Cu was a less efficient Cu source for apo-SOD. The results show that SOD is always present in a holo form in LEC rats since even MT-bound Cu can be delivered to SOD, while Cp is present in an apo form since Cu sequesters to MT and not in free ionic forms is available in LEC rats prior to the onset of acute hepatitis.",,"Suzuki, K.

The mRNA levels of Cu and metallothionein (MT) in the liver of LEC rats were reduced to the same levels as those of LEA rats by selective removal of Cu in vivo with tetrathiomolybdate. Cu was taken up by LEC rat cells to the same extent as LEA rat cells by exposure to low mean Cu and to a greater extent by exposure to high mean Cu, while MT mRNA level in LEC rat cells increased dose-dependently at a much higher rate than LEA -Rats. MT mRNA levels in both cells were comparable with cadmium, zinc and dexamethazone exposure. The results show that the expression of MT mRNA is selectively enhanced by Cu in LEC cells, although the uptake of Cu is comparable to that of normal cells.",,"Kanno, S.;Suzuki, J.

2612,Thiotungstate-copper interactions II. The effects of tetrathiotungstate on systemic copper metabolism in normal and copper-treated rats,"Intraperitoneal administration of tetrathiotungstate to rats (6–17.4 mg W/kg body weight) caused profound changes in copper metabolism in both normal and copper-experienced rats. Plasma copper associated with albumin was increased, hepatic copper, particularly cytosolic copper, was depleted, and biliary excretion was increased. There was also a movement from copper to higher molecular weight proteins in both liver cytosol and bile. In contrast to penicillamine, tetrathiotungstate did not increase hepatic cytosolic apometallothionein levels and reduced the copper-induced increase. Metallothionein bound copper has been removed. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity was inhibited and there was evidence of increased movement of copper to subcellular organelles, likely lysosomes. It is concluded that tetrathiotungstate has a true 'decoppering effect' and could be considered as an alternative to thiomolybdate in the treatment of copper storage diseases.",,"McQuaid, A.;Lamand, M.;Mason, J.",1994,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0162-0134%2894%2980005-7,0,0,
2613,Thiotungstate-copper interactions I. Studies on the metabolism of [<sup>185</sup>W]-tetrathiotungstate and the systemic interactions of labeled pharmacological doses with copper in rats,"185 ] Tetrathiotungstate was used to study the metabolism of thio compounds in rats after iv injection. At tracer concentrations (12.5 µg W), the major plasma-binding protein eluted at the position of ceruloplasmin, but association did not prevent hepatic uptake of thiotungstate. At higher doses (1.5 mg W) significant hydrolysis occurred immediately after injection with rapid urinary excretion of the label. The [ 185 W]-tetrathiotungstate remaining in the plasma was associated with albumin and the retained amount was increased by pretreating the rats with copper. Increased binding to albumin did not prevent hepatic uptake and increased movement of the isotope to subcellular organelles, probably lysosomes, during short-term pretreatment with copper. Bile excretion was increased and labeling was associated with high molecular weight proteins. In the liver cytosol, the <sup>185</sup>W was bound by specific proteins that have not yet been characterized. At the higher dose levels there was some movement towards higher molecular weight proteins and this was greatly enhanced by the copper pretreatment. The studies show that the metabolism of <sup>185</sup>W-tetrathiotungstate is sufficiently similar to <sup>99</sup>Mo- or <sup>35</sup>S-tetrathiomolybdate to permit work on the systemic interactions of thio compounds and allow copper in humans and animals.",,"McQuaid, A.;Lamand, M.;Mason, J.",1994,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0162-0134%2894%2980004-9,0,0,

We report high hepatic MT protein accumulation (more than 100-fold compared to wild-type mice) in toxic milk (tx) mice, along with significantly higher cytosolic copper and zinc levels. Increased MT gene transcription alone could not explain the high constitutive MT protein levels since MT mRNA levels were not elevated in tx mouse livers. However, hepatic MT was significantly more stable in adult tx mice: the MT half-life (t(1/2)) before and after Cd induction was 79 and 77% longer than in wild-type mice, respectively. Cd or Zn treatment increased MT mRNA but not MT protein, accumulation in tx mouse livers: Cd displaced MT-bound Zn and Cu in pre-existing MT. Thus, tx mice appear to accumulate hepatic MT as a result of reduced protein breakdown.

2624,"Zinc-induced metallothionein and copper metabolism in the intestinal mucosa, liver and kidneys of rats","High doses of parenteral zinc (Zn) and/or feeding Zn-rich diets to animals or humans for long periods impair copper (Cu) metabolism. Previous work suggests that Zn-induced metallothionein (MT) binds Cu and inhibits its absorption in intestinal epithelial cells. This study was designed to determine the effects of treating rats with high dietary or parenteral Zn on Cu metabolism and its relationship to MT in the intestinal epithelium, liver and kidney. Six-week-old male rats were fed a control diet containing 42 mg Zn and 6 mg Cu/kg for one week. Then they were divided into three groups. One group continued to receive the control diet while another received a similar diet containing 560 mg Zn/kg. A third group fed the control diet received a subcutaneous dose of 90 mg Zn/kg body weight every 2-3 days for the duration of the experiment. Rats from each group were sacrificed on days 7 and 14. Low Cu status in Zn-treated rats was indicated by lower than normal serum Cu concentration, serum ceruloplasmin activity, low liver and kidney Cu concentrations, and low cytochrome c oxidase activity. However, none of these changes were associated with an increase in Cu as a consequence of Zn-induced MT in the intestinal epithelial cell. Instead, the Cu concentration decreased with increasing MT concentration. This study suggests that the effects of high Zn treatment on Cu status are not the result of the long-held theory that Zn-induced intestinal MT sequesters Cu and prevents its passage into circulation. Instead, it may be caused by a direct effect of high lumenal Zn concentrations on Cu transport into the epithelial cell.",,"Reeves, P. G.;Rossow, K. L.;Bobilya, D.

In retrospect, the clinical picture was atypical, particularly with significant neurological involvement, mainly parkinsonism, which was almost uncontrollable and aggravated by neuroleptics. The chelation treatment with d-penicillamine led to a partial improvement of the neurological involvement since the extrapyramidal and neurovegetative symptoms persisted. Psychiatric symptoms improved with fewer antipsychotics than in the previous 12 years. However, the neuroleptics had to be continued because of the delay in diagnosing the disease, which reduced the effectiveness of the single chelation treatment.

The LEC groups at 7 and 13 weeks of age showed low Cu concentrations in all regions compared to the Long-Evans Agouti (LEA) rats.

Changes in the Zn concentration were not found in any area. The Fe concentration increased in the cortex and in the olfactory lobe. The three LEC groups showed a very high concentration of hepatic Cu and a low concentration of serum Cu compared to LEA rats. However, liver Cu was decreased and serum Cu was increased in LEC rats at 32 weeks of age compared to the other two LEC groups.

2678,"Metallothionein concentration in the liver of patients with Wilson's disease, primary biliary cirrhosis and liver metastases from colorectal cancer","In patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and Wilson's disease, hepatic copper concentrations increase during the development of the disease. The accumulated copper is believed to be detoxified by metallothionein, a protein that binds copper and zinc. In liver metastases from colorectal cancer, copper and zinc concentrations are usually decreased compared to normal liver tissue, but little is known about the associated metallothionein levels. In the present study, metallothionein concentrations were determined in archived liver samples from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and Wilson's disease and in normal and malignant liver samples from patients with metastases from colorectal adenocarcinoma. Twenty-seven control liver samples contained 3.98 +/- 1.55 mg metallothionein/g protein. Of the 21 liver samples from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis that had a mean metallothionein concentration of 6.06 +/- 5.03 mg/g protein, 6 were above the highest control value. Hepatic metallothionein concentrations were significantly increased in the 8 patients with Wilson's disease (10.98 +/- 6.93 mg/g protein, p<0.005 vs controls and p<0.05 vs primary biliary cirrhosis). In the 11 liver metastases from colorectal adenocarcinoma, metallothionein concentrations (1.17 +/- 0.90 mg/g protein) were significantly (p<0.005) lower than the surrounding normal liver tissue (4.25 +/- 1.75 mg /g protein). We conclude that in primary biliary cirrhosis and Wilson's disease, elevated hepatic metallothionein levels may detoxify accumulated copper. In addition, liver metastases from colorectal cancer contain less metallothionein than surrounding normal liver tissue.",,"Mulder, T. P. J.;Janssens, A. R.;Verspaget, H. W.;Van Hattum, J.;Lamers, C.

Seventeen had Wilson disease, 22 had autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, 6 had primary sclerosing cholangitis, 12 had chronic liver disease of various etiologies, 4 had cryptogenic acute liver failure, 6 had acute liver disease, and 8 had a variety of diseases with normal Liver histology appearance. Serum ceruloplasmin and total copper levels were significantly lower in patients with Wilson's disease compared to all other groups, but three children with Wilson's disease had normal ceruloplasmin levels and seven had normal total copper levels. No significant difference was found between the patients with Wilson's disease and the other groups for serum free copper levels and liver copper content. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion at baseline was significantly higher in patients with Wilson's disease compared to the other patients, but six children with Wilson's disease had values just above the upper limit of normal, which overlapped with values found in three children with liver failure, two with acute hepatitis, two with chronic active autoimmune hepatitis, and three with primary sclerosing cholangitis. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion after penicillamine challenge proved to be the single most accurate diagnostic test; Values above 25 µmol/24 h were present in 15 of 17 patients with Wilson's disease, but only in one child with liver failure out of 58 children with other diseases.

In contrast to previous studies, the present results show no gross differences in the subcellular distribution of copper between livers, with most copper being found in the soluble supernatant where it is associated with metallothionein. Ceruloplasmin mRNA levels were reduced in the two patients with Wilson's disease and also in one patient with fulminant liver failure. It remains to be confirmed whether the reduction in ceruloplasmin mRNA is specific to Wilson's disease.

D-penicillamine is a copper chelating agent and one of the drugs effective in human Wilson's disease in which abnormal copper metabolism is also observed. The results show that the treatment with D-penicillamine inhibited the elevation of serum transaminases, suppressed abnormal histological changes in the liver, and completely prevented the occurrence of hepatitis in the Long Evans cinnamon rats. We also found that liver copper concentration and serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were decreased, while urinary copper levels were increased in the D-penicillamine-treated Long Evans cinnamon rats. These findings indicate that the pathogenesis of hereditary hepatitis in Long-Evans cinnamon rats is due to abnormal accumulation of copper in the liver.",,"Togashi, Y.;Li, Y.;Kang, J.

Clinical onset was hepatic (50%) or neurologic (50%), but at diagnosis (6.4 years later), 67% of patients had multiple clinical manifestations: hepatic, neurologic, renal, and hematologic. Among the main diagnostic indices we find false negative results for the Kayser-Fleischer ring (25%), serum ceruloplasmin (8%) and total serum copper (34%).

In a 61-month follow-up, 5 patients (42%) died from severe liver failure. Patients with poor prognosis had a diagnostic delay and a significantly greater degree of liver failure than patients with good prognosis. Our results suggest the following conclusions: a) in Spain, the prevalence rate of Wilson's disease is close to the lower reported rate; b) early diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rare; c) Diagnosis should only be made if several essential indices are positive; d) Early liver transplantation has been performed in patients with acute or chronic severe liver failure.",,"Castellano, G.;Blasco, A.;Ballesta, F.;Colina, F.;Moreno, D.;Franch, O.;Urruzuno, P.;Solis, J.

2692,Failure of simple biochemical indexes to reliably distinguish fulminant Wilson's disease from other causes of fulminant liver failure,"In 21 cases of fulminant Wilson's disease, serum, urinary and tissue biochemical findings were evaluated for the value of a recently described biochemical index based on serum alkaline phosphatase and total serum bilirubin and these cases were compared to 193 other cases of fulminant liver failure. Serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and AST levels found in fulminant Wilson's disease differed significantly from those found in other cases of fulminant liver failure, but distinguishing from other causes of fulminant liver failure on the basis of these biochemical parameter was not possible. The alkaline phosphatase/bilirubin and aspartate AST/bilirubin ratios derived from the above parameters were also significantly lower in fulminant Wilson's disease than in other categories of fulminant liver failure, but a distinction between diagnostic categories on this basis was not possible. When ratios were selected that correctly identified all cases of fulminant Wilson's disease, 59/190 (31%) and 84/190 (44%) cases of non-Wilson's fulminant hepatic failure were incorrectly assigned a diagnosis of fulminant Wilson's disease by alkali phosphatase/bilirubin or AST/bilirubin ratios. A low alkaline phosphatase to bilirubin ratio (<0.57) in each category of fulminant liver failure suggested a significantly poorer prognosis than cases with higher ratios (chi<sup>2</sup>, Yates corrected = 5, 37, p=0.02). In the Wilson's disease group, serum and liver copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal in 4/21, 2/15, and 2/19, respectively, while urinary copper was elevated in 18/18, the most valuable test for the diagnosis was. Massively elevated hepatic copper stores with normal serum copper concentrations have been observed in some patients; in other tissues, the copper concentration varied up to 7-fold from different regions of the same liver. Treatment with D-penicillamine in five patients had no observable beneficial effect.",,"Sallie, R.;Katsiyiannakis, L.;Baldwin, D.;Davies, S.;O'Grady, J.;Mowat, A.;Mieli-Vergani, G.;Williams, R.",1992,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0270-9139%2892%2990016-3,0,0,
2693,Comparison of the disposition behavior and decoppering effect of triethylenetetramine in the animal model for Wilson's disease (Long Evans cinnamon rat) with normal Wistar rats,"The dispositional behavior and decoppering effect of triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (trientine), a selective chelating agent for copper and an ""orphan drug"" for Wilson's disease, were studied in an animal model, Long Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats, and normal rats ( Wistar). In LEC rats, the urinary excretion of trientine was remarkably lower than in Wistar rats. The rates of absorption from the jejunal loop and in vitro metabolism in the liver S9 fraction (supernatant of 9000 xg) were approximately the same for both strains. It is believed that the decrease in urinary excretion of trientine in LEC rats is mainly due to the reduction in functional activity of the kidney, since the urinary excretion of creatinine and phenolsulfonephthalein in LEC rats was significantly lower than in Wistar rats. Both an acceleration of urinary copper excretion and a reduction in hepatic copper levels were observed upon treatment with trientine in 6-week-old LEC rats. However, in LEC rats at 13 weeks of age, no liver decoppering effect was observed, although urinary copper excretion was increased. These results suggest that trientine has a pharmacological effect in disease, particularly in the early stages of hepatitis.",,"Iseki, K.;Kobayashi, M.;Ohba, A.;Miyazaki, K.;Li, Y.;Togashi, Y.;Takeichi, N.",1992,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bdd.2510130406,0,0,

2698,Recurrent abortion and the diagnosis of Wilson's disease,"We describe the first patient with Wilson's disease and recurrent abortion effectively treated with oral zinc for both conditions. Between the ages of 21 and 26, this patient experienced seven consecutive unexplained abortions. At the age of 27, neurological symptoms and liver dysfunction appeared. Wilson's disease was diagnosed when Kayser-Fleischer rings were detected in the cornea. A decapping therapy was initiated with zinc sulphate per os. By the age of 31, the hepatic and neurological symptoms had disappeared. The patient became pregnant and gave birth to her first healthy child after an uncomplicated eighth pregnancy. Two years later, a ninth pregnancy was just as successful. The likelihood that Wilson's disease could be the cause of repeated abortions is small. However, because the disease is fatal if left untreated and because it is an underdiagnosed condition, we recommend screening for Wilson disease in cases of unexplained recurrent miscarriages when there is a family history of consanguinity or neurological, psychiatric, and/or liver disease .

Kayser-Fleischer rings occurred in 23 of the neurological patients and only 4 of the liver patients. Neurological features were highly variable in terms of frequency and severity. The most common were dysdiadochokinesis (25 patients), dysarthria (23), bradykinesia (17), and postural tremor (14). Fifteen patients, mostly long-term treated, presented with rather subtle neurological abnormalities consisting predominantly of dysarthria and various forms of tremor. Eight patients had Parkinsonian-type neurological WD associated with evidence of organic mood syndrome. Three patients were predominantly hyperkinetic with dystonic and choreatic movements. In one patient, ataxia was the predominant neurological feature. There was a clear correlation between the severity of the neurological impairment and the impairment in performance. Nine patients were unable to work or were retired. Psychiatric symptoms and behavioral disorders were common, ranging from mild personality and psychiatric disorders to severe psychiatric illness resembling psychotic disorders and major depressive syndromes. No significant mental deterioration was noted among the patients. Mood disorders were observed in 12 patients, all of whom had neurological abnormalities. Seven patients had a history of attempted suicide and three had a history of organic delusional syndrome.",,"Oder, W.;Grimm, G.;Kollegger, H.;Ferenci, P.;Schneider, B.;Deecke, L.",1991,,,0,0,

2729,The effect of D-penicillamine on metallothionein mRNA levels and copper distribution in mouse hepatocytes,"Penicillamine increases metallothionein (MT) mRNA levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner without altering either the rate of copper uptake or the amount of copper in the cell. However, the effect is dependent on the presence of intracellular copper, since copper depletion by chelating agents blocks the effect and does not alter the ability of dexamethasone to stimulate mRNA production. Penicillamine did not alter the distribution of <sup>64</sup>Cu in hepatocytes as measured by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), although the pattern can be affected by the amount of MT present. The data show that penicillamine removes copper from some interfacial ligands, making it available to induce metallothionein.

Gastroduodenal intubation was performed in six healthy volunteers and five patients with Wilson's disease. After intravenous infusion of cholecystokinin octapeptide (40 ng/kg/h), pancreaticobiliary zinc secretion increased from a basal rate of 283.1 ± 75.8 nmol/L/min to a peak of 716.6 ± 175.3 nmol/L/min. min on in normal subjects. Normal subjects on a zinc-depleted diet had both lower basal (66.8 +/- 15.8 nmol/L/min) and lower stimulated (559.5 +/- 31 nmol/L/min) pancreaticobiliary zinc secretion than a zinc rich diet. In contrast to the markedly reduced pancreaticobiliary copper secretion, patients with Wilson's disease who were not treated with zinc had a normal basal (226.6 +/- 126 nmol/L/min) and a stimulated (728.7 +/- 195, 5 nmol/l/min) zinc secretion . These studies indicate that a significant amount of zinc is excreted into the pancreaticobiliary fluid in healthy subjects and that there was no impairment of zinc secretion in patients with Wilson's disease. Our data also indicate that pancreaticobiliary zinc secretion depends on subjects' zinc status, suggesting that endogenous zinc secretion may play a significant role in zinc homeostasis.",,"Lee, H.

2733,Hepatolenticular degeneration. [Serbian],"Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) is an inherited disease in which a metabolic disorder of copper leads to accumulation in the liver, brain, cornea and kidneys with consequent pathological changes in these organs. The inherited mechanism of the disease is autosomal recessive with a prevalence of 30-100 per 1,000,000 population. The etiology of this disease has not yet been elucidated. There are two hypotheses. The first is that it is a disorder of ceruloplasmin metabolism caused by insufficient synthesis of normal ceruloplasmin or synthesis of functionally abnormal ceruloplasmin. The second is: the blockage of copper biliary excretion, which is the consequence of the functional defect of the liver lysosomes. The pathogenetic mechanism of the disease is first the long-term accumulation of copper in the liver and later, when the liver depot is full, its release into the circulation and accumulation in the brain, cornea, kidneys and bones, leading to the corresponding pathological changes. The toxic activity of copper is due to its activity on enzymes, especially those with the -SH group. There are two basic clinical forms of the disease: liver disease or neurological disease. Liver damage is more common before puberty, while a neurological form of the disease is common in adolescents and young adults. Liver disease is nonspecific and characterized by symptoms of cirrhosis and chronic aggressive hepatitis. The only distinctive feature is hemolytic anemia, which, in combination with previous symptoms, is important for diagnosing the disease. Neurological symptoms are the most common consequence of pathological changes in the basal ganglia. In our patients, the most common symptoms were tremor (63%); dysarthria, choreoathetosis and rigidity (38%); ataxia and mental disorders (31%); Dysphagia and dystonia (12%), diplopia, hypersalivation, nystagmus and Babinski's sign (6%). Among the pathological changes in other tissues and organs, the most important is the detection of the Kayser-Fleischer ring in the cornea as a result of copper accumulation. Its importance for an accurate diagnosis is great. Diagnosis of the disease is based on anamnesis, clinical examination, specific and nonspecific laboratory tests. The treatment of choice is penicillamine. If we start it early, the outcome will be a good remission in the majority of patients. Late diagnosis or delay in treatment results in death resulting from bleeding from esophageal varices or basal ganglia disease. Immunological damage caused by penicillamine requires interruption of therapy and substitution with tri-ethyl-tetra-amine (TETA). We also use zinc salts and tetrathiomolibdate in the therapy of this disease. The pathogenesis, clinical picture and therapy of the disease are based on our own results.",,"Zudenigo, D.;Relja, M.",1990,,,0,0,

While taking penicillamine, 1 g iv four times a day, the neurological symptoms worsened and akinesia, mutism, tachy- and bradyarrhythmias, and transient respiratory failure developed. The copper concentration in the serum was significantly reduced to 28 µg/dl on the sixth day of treatment and increased to 60 µg/dl on the ninth day.

It was only after the penicillamine dosage was drastically reduced to 600 mg three times a day that there was an improvement, and after 11 weeks the patient was able to walk again and was discharged. A pronounced, mainly hepatic, copper deficiency due to the high penicillamine dosage was the likely cause of the patient's initial deterioration.

2751,Interactions with trace metals in vivo: Inorganic cobalt enhances urinary copper excretion without inducing associated zincuresis in rats,"The effects of cobalt chloride on copper and zinc metabolism in male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. These effects were compared to those of penicillamine, a chelating agent used in therapy for the human genetic abnormality of copper metabolism, Wilson's disease. Cobalt induced an increased (~4-fold) urinary copper excretion after a single dose of cobalt that lasted for 72 hours. In contrast to the marked increase in urinary zinc excretion induced by penicillamine, cobalt greatly reduced (~75%) urinary zinc excretion. Tissue copper and zinc concentrations were measured after treatment with cobalt in doses of 12 to 60 mg/kg body weight. Significantly reduced (~25%) copper concentration in the kidney was observed 1 and 3 days after cobalt administration. In addition, cobalt simultaneously produced a dose-dependent increase (up to 1.6-fold) in hepatic zinc concentration. Cytosolic zinc was eluted from a Sephadex G-75 column in the molecular weight range associated with metallothionein. The time-dependent induction of hepatic metallothionein concentration (10-fold) by cobalt was confirmed by the cadmium/hemoglobin affinity assay. The ability of inorganic cobalt to increase hepatic zinc concentration and cause increased urinary copper excretion without the zincuresis normally associated with penicillamine administration represents a redefined biological property of this essential trace metal.",,"Rosenberg, D.

2758,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. VII. Protection of the liver from copper toxicity by zinc-induced metallothionein in a rat model,"In patients with Wilson's disease, further elevations in hepatic copper are common when zinc is given as initial treatment, although there is no associated clinical worsening. To better understand this situation, an animal model was developed in which copper-exposed rats were treated with subcutaneously administered zinc. In the presence of equal amounts of copper loading in the liver, control rats show liver damage but zinc-treated rats do not. Rats treated with zinc have much higher levels of hepatic metallothionein. Gel filtration studies show that most of the liver copper in zinc-treated rats is in this metallothionein fraction, while in control animals the copper is mainly associated with high or low molecular weight fractions. Subcutaneous zinc therapy also induces metallothionein in the gut but not in the brain. We interpret these findings as suggesting that zinc therapy protects against hepatic copper toxicity by inducing hepatic metallothionein, which sequesters copper in a nontoxic form.",,"Lee, D.

It is generally believed that the chelating agents work by mobilizing copper from the liver, allowing for urinary excretion. This publication examined the effect of chelating agents on copper uptake and storage in mouse hepatocytes. Penicillamine, a clinically important chelating agent, does not block copper uptake or remove copper from hepatocytes. Two other copper chelators, Sar and Diamsar, which consist of very stable and kinetically inert Cu<sup>2+</sup> complexes by encapsulating the metal ion in an organic cage, have been shown to block and remove up to 80% of copper accumulation by cells cell-associated copper. They also removed most (~80%) of the <sup>64</sup> Cu accumulated by the cells in 30 min, but deposited only a small percentage (<20%) of that accumulated over 18 h . The results indicate that copper in the hepatocytes can be partitioned into at least two pools, one readily accessible and another that cannot be removed even after prolonged incubation with one of the chelating agents. Most of the copper normally found in the cell appears to be associated with the former pool.",,"McArdle, H. J.;Gross, S. M.;Creaser, I.;Sargeson, A. M.;Danks, D. M.",1989,,,0,0,

2768,Wilson's disease: symptomatic treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Some comments,"Neuropsychiatric disorders in Wilson's disease may require symptomatic relief beyond often lengthy anticopper treatment. Simultaneous damage to the brain and liver requires careful drug selection, dosage, and recognition of these symptoms of copper accumulation in the brain and those of hepatic encephalopathy. Benzodiazepines with a short half-life, ""non-classical"" neuroleptics, anticholinergics and phenobarbital can be valuable therapeutic tools in the symptomatic treatment of Wilson's disease. Wilson disease is a rare condition characterized by degenerative changes in the brain with softening of the basal ganglia and cirrhosis of the liver. The bile excretion of copper is disturbed and the metal accumulates in the liver, brain and other tissues. Patients usually present in their second or third decades of life with hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric involvement. the administration of agents that remove copper from the body, prevent penicillamine or its absorption, have zinc or possibly both effects, such as trientine, at least ameliorate or reverse the manifestations of the most established Wilson's disease, even after months or years, and its onset prevent in asymptomatic affected siblings. Anticopper therapy for Wilson's disease has been extensively reviewed (Walshe, 1986; Brewer et al., 1987; Hogenraad et al., 1987; Marsden, 1987; Walshe, 1988). However, in addition to specific anticopper therapy, in severe cases, especially in patients whose clinical picture is deteriorating at the beginning of penicillamine treatment (Brewer et al., 1987), symptomatic treatment can be carried out and the selection of the right treatment can be difficult in the presence of Brain damage concomitant with liver involvement.

The action of PSH in PSS may also be due to thiazolidine formation, an accepted biochemical reaction of PSH. However, the pharmacodynamics of PSH in suppressing inflammatory activity in RA and possibly PSS remains poorly understood. Future studies must be conducted in systems that adequately model PSH-responsive inflammatory disease and are exposed to therapeutically relevant concentrations of PSh and its metabolites. An improved understanding of the pharmacodynamics of PSH should lead to safer and more effective use of the drug and provide direction for the development of new anti-inflammatory drugs.",,"Joyce, D.

With this drug, levels of alkaline phosphatase, cholinesterase, and total bilirubin normalized but became abnormal again after about seven weeks. Despite substitution of coagulation factors, the thromboplastin time remained shortened. She died 82 days after the onset of symptoms. In the second patient, treatment with penicillamine was started immediately without waiting for histological confirmation. All laboratory values normalized and remained so.

We compared a standard immunofluorescence method with a new enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the detection of StrAb. Retrospective testing of 264 stored sera using the two methods yielded well-correlated results (58 sera were positive in both assays; r=0.8). In 104 patients with spontaneously acquired MG or thymoma, the results were 100% concordant, of which 53% were positive. In 34 recipients of D-penicillamine, StrAb were found in 15% by EIA and in 6% by immunofluorescence. StrAb were detected in two of four bone marrow recipients by EIA and in one by immunofluorescence. Prospective testing of 434 fresh sera (of which 49 were positive by both methods) yielded only 4 discordant results. Serial EIA quantification of StrAb in two patients with MG and thymoma proved useful in monitoring immunosuppressive therapy, and in a third patient, sera were predicted to have recurrence in the tumor. A high prevalence of StrAb was found by both assays in elderly patients with spontaneous MG, but StrAb were more easily quantified by EIA. The EIA method was found to be highly sensitive and specific for the detection of StrAb in patients with and without MG thymoma, in patients treated with D-penicillamine, and in patients with graft-versus-host disease after bone marrow transplantation.",,"Cikes, N.;Momoi, M.

We propose that zinc ions contained in nerve endings are extruded into the extracellular space during neuronal activity. Excessive levels of zinc can be released during intense neuronal activation and contribute to the observed seizures and toxic damage. Zinc ions are found in high concentrations in mossy fibers of the hippocampal formation, and it is the postsynaptic neurons of these fibers that are most susceptible to the toxic effects of kainic acid, a potent anticonvulsant, or to chronic exposure to organometallic compounds.

Sections frozen with glutaraldehyde were satisfactory for copper, sulfur, and phosphorus. Five patients (one patient with Wilson's disease, one patient with chronic cholestasis, one with chronic hepatitis, and two with asymptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis) had radiographs of copper and sulfur consistent with hepatocellular lysosomes. Second, the sections frozen with glutaraldehyde were used for a study of copper deposits in the patients' livers. There was a significant correlation between copper and sulfur levels in the lysosomes of all patients studied, but no correlation in the rest of the cytoplasm. Zinc was not detected in the lysosomes.

2820,Kinetics of copper absorption in zinc overload states and after zinc supplement deprivation: the role of endogenous zinc status,"Zinc (Zn) has been used at therapeutic doses to inhibit copper (Cu) absorption in patients with Wilson's disease. A series of experiments were performed to confirm the effects of high Zn dosages on Cu absorption using the experimental animal model. In the first experiment, five groups of mice were fed five different concentrations of Zn over a period of 35 days: 6 ppm (staple diet), 30 ppm (control), 750 ppm, 1,000 ppm and 2,400 ppm. The <sup>64</sup>Cu loading test was performed to measure the whole body retention (WBR) of <sup>64</sup>Cu on days 10, 14, 21 and 35. The results showed that the inhibition of <sup>64</sup>Cu absorption by Zn is dose- and time-dependent. However, maximum inhibition occurred in mice fed 1,000 ppm Zn and no additional effect was observed in mice fed 2,400 ppm Zn. In the second experiment, the distribution of retained <sup>64</sup>Cu dose between the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and enteric carcass in the controls and in the 750 ppm Zn-fed group was measured. While the WBR of <sup>64</sup>Cu was significantly lower (p<0.01) in mice fed 750 ppm Zn, the retained dose distribution was unaffected. In the third experiment, one group of mice was fed 30 ppm Zn for 70 days (control) and a second group was fed 1,000 ppm Zn (saturation) for the first 35 days, after which they were switched to the basal diet (6 ppm) for the following 35 days (exhaustion). <sup>64</sup>Cu WBR was performed at intervals throughout the experimental period. Endogenous faecal Zn (MFZn) was determined at the end of saturation (0 t) and at intervals during saturation. The results of this experiment showed that the effect of Zn on <sup>64</sup>Cu absorption persisted up to 21-35 days after stopping the Zn supplement. Furthermore, WBR of <sup>64</sup>Cu correlated significantly (r = -0.92, p < 0.005) with MFZn. We conclude that (a) high doses of Zn may not cause complete inhibition of Cu absorption and (b) endogenous Zn excreted in the GIT (as MFZn) play an important role in inhibition of Cu absorption and plays a part in maintaining the high endogenous Zn status is essential for maximal inhibition of Cu absorption.",,"Cossack, Z.

The great diagnostic importance of the copper metabolism (plasma copper level, urine copper), the plasma ceruloplasmin concentration, the histochemical and quantitative determination of copper in liver cells (after liver biopsy) is pointed out. These are of particular importance in young patients (less than 25 years of age) and in children with chronic parenchymal liver disease. In 1/4 of the patients, the early stage of the disease resembled chronic active hepatitis (predominantly liver type of the disease). The basic therapeutic drug is D-penicillamine hydrochloride, and if it is not tolerated, the drug triene can be used. Very good therapeutic results and a significant improvement in the prognosis, social and professional rehabilitation of the patients were achieved.

2832,Clinical-biochemical diagnosis of Wilson's disease and its therapy. [Slovak],"This review article deals with the current state of knowledge in pathophysiology, clinical-biochemical (CB) diagnostics and therapy of Wilson's disease (Wd). CB screening is performed by determining ceruloplasmin and total serum copper, urinary copper under alkaline conditions and after administration of penicillamine. In the second step, screening is carried out in the event of diagnostic uncertainty (as well as postmortem) by quantitative determination of copper in biopsy liver samples or by the <sup>64</sup>Cu stress test. This fatal congenital disease has been effectively treated with penicillamine and, in the case of intolerance, with triethylenetetramine hydrochloride for over 30 years. The latest zinc therapy has a different mechanism of action – it eliminates excess copper from the body through the faeces, while previous treatments through the urine. To monitor treatment of Wd, the authors recommend adjusting the dosage based on urinary copper excretion or the <sup>64</sup>Cu stress test. The therapy is checked once a year - unless the clinical condition of the patient requires shorter intervals - by determining the copper excretion in the urine on 2-3 consecutive days and by checking the tubular functions. Haemogram, ALT and urinalysis should be examined at least 4 times a year together with the clinical follow-up. In the case of zinc therapy, serum zinc should be monitored. Finally, the authors propose groups indicated for CB screening for Wd, which is not as rare as previously thought (1:35000 or 1:50000 today): 1) Patients with suspected hepatological or neurological symptoms aged 5 to 60 years. 2) First-degree relatives of the patient with Wd 3) Children with chronic liver symptoms or acute symptoms with an inherently long-lasting or fulminant course. Children should even look for the Kayser-Fleischer-Ring with a slit lamp. Screening for Wd and therapy monitoring are performed: 1) by a clinician alone in strict compliance with specimen collection requirements, 2) by a clinician in collaboration with a clinical biochemistry specialist, 3) by a CB Metabolic Unit in collaboration with a clinician.",,"Slugenova, E.",1987,,,0,0,

2835,Liver cirrhosis: Is drug therapy of the underlying disease possible? [German],"Liver cirrhosis has many causes, and the answer to the question, ""Is it advisable to treat liver cirrhosis with medication?"" depends on the underlying cause and not on histology. In the case of hereditary diseases such as Wilson's disease or hemochromatosis, for which specific treatment is very successful, the answer is definitely yes. In primary biliary cirrhosis, drug treatment with corticosteroids is only justified if there are features of chronic active autoimmune hepatitis (CAH). The results with penicillamine appear disappointing. Azathioprine may be of value in some cases. Colchicine and cyclosporine are in the experimental phase and the results are not yet available. HB(s)AG-negative autoimmune CAH cirrhosis should be treated with corticosteroids or with a combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine for months or even years. Steroids are no longer recommended for HB(s)AG-positive patients with CAH cirrhosis, as the results of controlled studies indicate that they can even be harmful: the replication of the virus is enhanced and the tendency to form cancer can be increased. The results of treatment with antiviral drugs alone or in combination with interferon are still sparse and more needs to be evaluated before recommendations can be made. Drug treatment is rarely successful in alcohol-related liver disease. Glucocorticosteroids have been tried and may be indicated in rare, exceptional cases with encephalopathy. Propylthiouracil and colchicine are currently used in controlled trials; Conclusive evidence is still lacking as to whether androgenic hormones are useful in the treatment of alcoholic cirrhosis.",,"Martini, G.

Lethargy and anorexia (70%), jaundice (50%) and abdominal pain (48%) were the most common symptoms, and less common were mental deterioration (22%) and recurrent epistaxis (22%). The duration of symptoms before diagnosis ranged from five days to three years (mean 10.5 months), and only five of the patients were diagnosed before referral. Analysis of physical signs at presentation showed that hepatomegaly (81%) and splenomegaly (70%) were common, and the only signs that were significantly more common in the 13 deaths were jaundice and ascites. In three of these patients and one other surviving patient, the clinical course was exceptionally severe and indistinguishable from fulminant liver failure. Based on the severity of the abnormality of serum aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin and prothrombin time on admission, a prognostic index was derived that allowed complete separation of fatal and non-fatal cases and, when subsequently used in a further nine index cases, correctly predicted the outcome. Two other cases found to have indices in the fatal category did well after liver transplantation, which must be considered once the diagnosis is made in cases with such severe liver damage.",,"Nazer, H.;Ede, R.

Overall, the data show a progressive decrease in both serum copper and zinc concentrations. Urinary copper excretion gradually stabilized at about 50% of baseline levels, but zinc excretion increased. Urinary zinc:copper ratios therefore increased with the duration of treatment. Copper excretion was considered sufficient when challenge with a test dose of D-penicillamine did not result in an increase in copper excretion. Urinary zinc excretion was further increased by the test dose. Zinc deficiency was clinically suspected in one patient receiving D-penicillamine maintenance therapy. Dose reduction alleviated symptoms, urinary zinc loss decreased from 64 to 34 µmol/24 hours, and copper excretion remained largely unchanged. The data obtained show that D-penicillamine alters the metabolism of both copper and zinc. The extent is not only dose-dependent, but is also related to the effectiveness of copper excretion. Both copper and zinc concentrations must be monitored to assess the benefits of treatment and the risks of overt or subclinical zinc deficiency.",,"Van Caillie-Bertrand, M.;Degenhart, J.

2858,Oral zinc sulfate in Wilson's disease,"After initially promoting copper excretion with D-penicillamine, the effect of oral zinc sulfate (3 x 150 mg/day, loading dose; 3 x 100 mg/day, maintenance dose) was evaluated in two children with clinically stable Wilson's disease after completion of a three-year treatment. The course, assessed according to clinical, biochemical and histological parameters, was satisfactory in both cases. The copper concentration in urine fell to less than 1.26 µmol/24 hours; and serum copper concentration continued to decrease during zinc sulfate treatment. In one child, the increase in 24-hour urinary copper excretion observed after a loading dose of D-penicillamine (+/- 20 mg/kg) remained constant throughout the observation period, while the liver copper content of 1460 mg /g dry weight dropped to 890 cups/g dry weight. However, in the other patient, liver copper and 24-hour urinary copper excretion increased after D-penicillamine challenge during the third year of treatment. We conclude that zinc sulfate is a low-toxic and well-tolerated alternative to D-penicillamine. However, dosage depends on individual factors that are not yet well understood, and we recommend limiting use to patients who do not tolerate D-penicillamine well. We recommend treatment monitoring with annual D-penicillamine challenge and liver biopsy if liver function deteriorates.",,"Van Caillie-Bertrand, M.;Degenhart, H. J.;Visser, H. K. A.",1985,,,0,1,

[Japanese],"We conducted a follow-up study in 17 Wilson's disease patients (6 males, 11 females) to evaluate the effect of penicillamine therapy. All patients were treated with penicillamine for 1 to 17 years. The severity of the patients was determined using the Goldstein et al. Six of 17 patients showed improvement, 6 patients showed no change in severity, and 4 patients died despite treatment. One patient has been asymptomatic on treatment for 7 years. An improvement was observed in the group treated with more than 600 mg penicillamine/day and also in the group treated for more than 5 years. There was no association between pre-treatment severity and subsequent treatment effects. These results suggest that penicillamine dosage and duration of treatment are important factors in patients' clinical improvement.",,"Tanaka, K.;Itoyama, Y.;Tobimatsu, S.",1985,,,0,0,
2864,Teratogenic risk during treatment of Wilson's disease. [French],"Left untreated, Wilson's disease usually causes infertility or abortion due to increased intrauterine copper levels. Therefore, chelation treatment is necessary throughout pregnancy. The most commonly used is D-penicillamine, whose teratogenic risks such as cutis laxa, dermatopathy or complex mesenchymal abnormalities are paradoxically rare in newborns born to mothers with Wilson's disease, possibly due to hypercuremia protecting the fetus from excessive copper deficiency. However, it is advisable to reduce the chelation treatment by about a quarter and add 50 mg of vitamin B6 weekly, as we did in our case whose child was born normally.",,"Piussan, C.;Mathieu, M.",1985,Sep,,0,0,
2865,Interactions of trace elements: clinical significance,"We examined the interaction of the trace element zinc with copper and lead. In sickle cell anemia, the usual situation is mild to moderate zinc deficiency due to renal zinc loss. Zinc deficiency appears to result in mild copper overload and increased ceruloplasmin levels, likely through increased copper absorption. With zinc therapy, this process is reversed. Pharmacological doses of zinc, when administered at a level that ensures efficacy (without food), usually result in copper deficiency. We took advantage of zinc's copper-depleting properties to develop a new therapy for Wilson's disease. Zinc inhibits the absorption of dietary copper by inducing intestinal metallothionein and inhibits the reabsorption of endogenously secreted copper, thereby producing a negative copper balance in Wilson's disease. Once we are certain that zinc blocks the accumulation of copper in the liver of patients with Wilson's disease, zinc therapy will become available as an approach to treating this deadly disease. Animal literature indicates that zinc protects against lead toxicity when both elements are administered orally, undoubtedly through the intestinal metallothionein mechanism. In preliminary experiments in rats, we could not show that the toxicity of lead entering the body non-orally is affected by oral zinc supplements.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Hill, G.;Dick, R. D.",1985,,,0,0,
2866,Genetic trace metal disorders,"Genetic trace metal disorders can occur at three levels. Trace metals play an important role in the metabolism of genetic macromolecules and in the information transmission system. A deficiency or excess of trace metals, caused by either dietary or genetic factors, impairs the normal functioning of the whole organism. The roles of trace metals in carcinogenesis/mutagenesis and aging are typical of this category. The second level of genetic trace metal disorders involves the metabolic pathway of the trace metal itself. Biochemical disorders resulting from genetic defects cause defective metabolism of the element and thus disease symptoms. Diseases caused by abnormal metabolism of copper, zinc, iron and molybdenum are discussed. Trace metal disorders can also result from other genetic diseases. This aspect of genetic trace metal disorders is the least studied. However, information should be important to improve the existing treatment protocol for the more common inborn errors of metabolism such as phenylketonuria.",,"Wai-Yee, Chan;Rennert, O.

[Japanese],"We report a 16-year-old boy with Wilson's disease who suddenly relapsed with generalized dystonia that was relieved by high doses of trihexyphenidyl. When he developed a hemolytic crisis at the age of 6, he was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. When he was 14 years old, he developed gait disturbances, dysgraphia, and dysarthria. These were only improved by increasing the D-penicillamine dosage. He was doing well until he got acutely worse shortly after an acute respiratory infection. On admission he was unable to walk, speak, or swallow, and presented with violent involuntary movements and right hemiplegia. However, liver functions were normal. Dystonia and anarthria persisted, although involuntary movements and hemiplegia gradually improved. The surface EMG showed the characteristic dystonic pattern. A few weeks after starting treatment with trihexyphenidyl 10 mg daily, he was able to stand, walk and write. When the drug was stopped to see how effective it was, he appeared to be worse and could barely walk or write. Psychiatric symptoms such as irritability and emotional instability were noted as side effects, but they were not severe enough to warrant drug discontinuation. Seven months after the start of treatment, dystonia tended to fluctuate, increasing in the morning and decreasing in the evening, without corresponding diurnal changes in CSF homovanillic acid or dopamine levels. Fahn (1979) reported that treatment of various types of dystonia with high doses of trihexyphenidyl in childhood was particularly effective. In the present case, too, we were able to determine a positive effect with trihexyphenidyl at a dosage of 10-12 mg daily without serious side effects.",,"Hirabayashi, S.;Kanda, H.;Tsuno, T.",1985,,,0,0,

TETA was scheduled for toxicological evaluation due to a lack of such information. Analytical chemical methods to determine the purity of the drug and the correct concentration and stability of the drug in the dosed water were prerequisites for the toxicological tests. A high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method employing ion pair and conductivity detection was developed to analyze TETA in dosed water at concentrations as low as 10 µg/mL and to determine drug purity. The response of the conductivity detector was linear over the concentration range of 10 to 100 µg/mL. Data are presented on the stability of the drug in water during storage at ambient temperature and after autoclaving. An additional colorimetric method for the analysis of aqueous TETA solutions is also presented, based on the measurement of the absorbance at 599 nm of the colored TETA copper chelate. The HPLC method is applicable to the analysis of TETA and the chemically similar polyamines spermidine and spermine in admixture.",,"Hansen Jr, E. B.;Rushing, L. G.;Thompson Jr, H. C.",1985,,,0,0,

We treated a 19-year-old man with decompensated liver cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease with zinc sulfate. D-penicillamine had to be discontinued because proteinuria developed during treatment. After discontinuation of D-penicillamine, an increase in serum copper almost to the normal range was observed; at the same time, the copper excretion in the urine decreased. With oral zinc sulfate therapy (145 mg/day) a reduction in serum copper levels was achieved and liver function improved; Serum albumin, gamma globulins and prothrombin time reached normal values. The patient did not complain of any side effects during oral zinc sulfate therapy. Oral zinc therapy in Wilson's disease can be considered as an alternative to treatment with D-penicillamine when this drug has to be discontinued due to side effects.",,"Ramadori, G.;Keidl, E.;Hutteroth, Th",1985,,,0,0,

2881,Long-term treatment for chronic hepatitis. [German],"Before deciding on long-term treatment, each case of chronic hepatitis requires histological classification and knowledge of the etiology. Drug- and alcohol-induced chronic active hepatitis is treated solely by eliminating the pathogen. Additional measures are not required. Only symptomatic patients with chronic hepatobiliary diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be treated. Standard therapy consists of cholestyramine, fat-soluble vitamins and medium-chain triglycerides. Treatment with penicillamine must be limited to advanced stages. Whether liver transplantation plays a role in the treatment of PBC remains to be seen. Some types of chronic active hepatitis caused by metabolic or autoimmune diseases can be treated with a standardized regimen. Hemochromatosis should be treated by regular phlebotomy. Wilson's disease requires lifelong treatment with penicillamine, and autoimmune hepatitis responds well to steroids or a combination of steroids and azathioprine. The optimal treatment for patients with Hb(s)Ag positive and non-A, non-B chronic active hepatitis is still under investigation. Immunosuppression is not recommended.

Formation of thiazolidine with maturing collagen renders D-penicillamine potentially teratogenic; Sulfhydryl disulfide exchange allows the formation of a mixed disulfide with L-cysteine from the L-cystine dimer; Chelation allows it to bind metals such as copper; and superoxide scavenging theoretically makes it capable of influencing the inflammatory response of specific cellular systems.

A resumption of the penicillamine therapy 2 weeks before the fulminant decompensation could not prevent it. Renal failure in this patient was apparently secondary to rhabdomyolysis. The addition of penicillamine to a peritoneal dialysis solution enabled chelation and the removal of over 14 mg of copper per day, but with no apparent benefit. Exchange transfusion and high-dose dexamethasone therapy (24 mg/day) were equally ineffective in reversing liver failure. Other reported cases have also been fatal.

2889,Diagnostic value and significance of radiocopper stress test abnormalities in Wilson's disease. [French],"Wilson's disease was suspected in this patient based on the association of histologic features of chronic active hepatitis and elevated hepatic copper concentration. However, the patient had long-term cholestasis, showed neither the Kayser-Fleischer ring nor neurological symptoms and had a serum ceruloplasmin concentration in the normal range. The time course of plasma 64-Cu levels in this patient was compared to those found in four other subjects: one normal subject, two patients with typical Wilson's disease and one patient with primary biliary cirrhosis. Similar time courses were observed for both the patient suspected of having Wilson's disease and the two typical cases, making the diagnosis unequivocal. This pattern differed from that of the normal subject in the absence of a secondary increase in plasma <sup>64</sup>Cu concentration. In the patient with primary biliary cirrhosis, the time course was between that of the normal subject and that of patients with Wilson's disease. These results suggest that: 1) a radiocopper loading test is useful in diagnosing difficult cases of Wilson's disease, particularly when ceruloplasmin levels are normal; 2) the lack of a secondary increase in plasma <sup>64</sup>Cu levels in Wilson's disease is largely independent of the decrease in serum ceruloplasmin; it appears to be more related to dilution of the isotope in an expanded hepatic copper pool and to abnormalities in intrahepatic copper distribution.",,"Mavier, P.;Meignan, M.;Wirquin, E.",1982,,,0,0,

2903,Hudson Memorial Lecture: Wilson's Disease: Genetics and Biochemistry - Their Relevance to Therapy,"Wilson's disease is an inherited metabolic disorder that affects children, adolescents and young adults. Before puberty, the first signs and symptoms are almost always related to liver damage, with or without hemolysis. After puberty, neurological symptoms become more prominent, always involving the motor centers, sometimes the personality, never the sensory nervous system. The most characteristic physical sign is Kayser Fleischer's corneal pigment ring, which results from the deposition of copper in Descemet's membrane. The primary genetic defect is unknown, but the disease appears to result from a failure of hepatocytes to excrete copper in the bile. As a result, this metal accumulates first in the liver, then, when this organ is saturated, in the brain, in the cornea and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys. Once present in excess in tissues, copper poisons various enzyme systems, leading to cell damage and cell death. At present there is no satisfactory explanation for the pleomorphic nature of the disease, let alone for the often gross asymmetry of the lesions in the brain. Treatment involves establishing a negative copper balance until the body's abnormal metal stores are removed. After that, the patient must be kept in balance for life. Two main medications are available for this purpose, penicillamine and triethylenetetramine (Trientine). Both will achieve biochemical and clinical reversal of the disease. Pencillamine can lead to a variety of toxic reactions, mostly on an immunological basis; It is therefore important to regularly check blood counts and kidney function. At present, less is known about trientine's potential to cause adverse effects. Wilson's disease is characterized by recessive inheritance. It can be diagnosed in the pre-symptomatic stage by noting abnormalities in copper metabolism. All families should be evaluated and, if necessary, prophylactic treatment initiated to arrest clinical progression of the disease.",,"Walshe, J. M.",1983,,,0,0,
2904,Metallothionein - Aspects related to copper and zinc metabolism,"Metallothionein is a cysteine-rich, low molecular weight protein that binds zinc, copper and cadmium. It is inducible in the liver, kidney, and gut by glucocorticoids, changes in dietary zinc supply, acute exposure to various metals, dietary restriction, infection, stress, and endotoxin treatment. The regulation of synthesis involves altered gene expression. The protein degrades fairly rapidly when zinc is the primary bound metal species, but the rate of degradation is reduced when cadmium or copper are also bound. The net result of metallothionein production appears to be accumulation of bound metal and/or intracellular metal redistribution. Accumulation of copper in various tissues of individuals with Menkes and Wilson disease may be related to altered metallothionein turnover. The physiological function is not clear, but metallothionein's response to hormonal stimuli suggests an important role in cellular metabolism.",,"Cousins, R. J.",1983,,,0,0,

The earliest clinical sign of liver disease was hepatosplenomegaly with altered liver function indices. The disease was found in 4 pairs of siblings from the reported families. In all cases, the diagnosis was based on the values of ceruloplasmin, serum copper, basal urine copper and urine copper after D-penicillamine. Furthermore, a greatly increased copper concentration in the liver was detected in 8 cases. D-penicillamine therapy resulted in improvement in liver function in 8 cases, 6 of which were affected only by the liver form, and the treatment was reasonably tolerated. In 1 case this therapy caused a nephrotic syndrome and was replaced by triene-2HCL.

Initial myasthenic symptoms in all patients consisted of variable diplopia and/or ptosis with progression to more general involvement in 7 of them. No clinical, humoral, or genetic factor has been identified that would allow the identification of individuals who develop generalized versus ocular myasthenia. Discontinuation of penicillamine was associated with a slow resolution of symptoms over a period of 4-60 weeks, which was facilitated by the use of anticholinesterase drugs in 12 patients. Partial unilateral ptosis persisted in 2 patients at 15 and 25 months, while another patient had diplopia 42 months after resolution of the other myasthenic symptoms. The patients with PIM showed a significant increase in HLD Dr1 (p corr < 0.005) and an absence of HLA Dr3 compared to a healthy ""control"" population. A genetic susceptibility to the development of PIM, different from that observed in spontaneously onset myasthenia gravis, is suggested by this abnormal distribution of HLA Dr antigens.",,"Delamere, J.

2914,Hypoparathyroidism at Morbus Wilson,"An 11-year-old girl with Wilson's disease presented with mild hypocalcemia (8.0 mg per deciliter), hypophosphatemia (2.7 mg per deciliter), hypercalciuria (569 mg per day), and hyperphosphaturia (tubular reabsorption of phosphate, 67 percent) in front. The hyperphosphaturia and hypercalciuria have been attributed to Fanconi syndrome, a known component of Wilson's disease. Circulating immunoreactive parathyroid hormone was usually undetectable or occasionally detectable at minimal levels in the presence of decreased blood levels of ionized calcium. Normal ionized calcium levels were not maintained during a 24-hour monitoring period. The patient had tetany during a period when ionized calcium levels were rapidly declining, and an adequate increase in circulating immunoreactive parathyroid levels was never demonstrated. Induced hypocalcemia during citrate infusion did not stimulate parathyroid secretion nor did magnesium infusion. We conclude that parathyroid insufficiency may be associated with Wilson disease. We suspect that this is due to the deposition of copper in the parathyroid glands.",,"Carpenter, T. O.;Carnes Jr, D. L.;Anast, C. S.",1983,,,0,0,

2917,A new look at cirrhosis,"There have been modest advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of certain types of cirrhosis, but the current classification system is not entirely satisfactory. For example, how do we classify the type of cirrhosis found in a person who drinks 80 g alcohol per day, is hepatitis BsAg positive and is considered MZ heterozygous for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency? Many cases of cirrhosis can have multifactorial causes; Alcohol and the hepatitis B virus can act synergistically in this regard. Some types of cirrhosis, such as those caused by the hepatitis B virus, may now be preventable, while others may be partially reversible. For hereditary diseases like Wilson's disease and hemachromatosis, for which specific treatments exist, it's important to evaluate other family members. For established cirrhosis associated with conditions such as non-A, non-B hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and Indian childhood cirrhosis, the antifibrogenic drugs penicillamine and colchicine show promise, although it is questionable whether either drug has been used outside of cirrhosis should limitations of a controlled study. Finally, liver transplantation should be considered in some forms of end-stage cirrhosis.",,"Warnes, T. W.",1982,,,0,0,
2918,Patterns of hepatocyte injury in humans,"Three patterns of hepatocyte damage in humans, direct, immunological and cholestatic, are described. The features of the direct pattern are predominantly mitochondrial damage, central (zone 3) necrosis, and usually fatty changes. It can be subdivided into the alcohol type (also in obesity, diabetes, as a reaction to perhexiline, in Wilson's disease and in Indian children's cirrhosis) and the type of Reye's syndrome (also in tetracycline toxicity, pregnancy fatty liver, and cytostatics). Reactive drug metabolites, metal poisoning, and anoxia are also associated with the direct pattern of hepatocyte damage. The immunological pattern is characterized by damage to cell membranes with patchy necrosis of periportal (zone 1) hepatocytes and mononuclear cell infiltration. Examples include chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and drug reactions such as that to halothane. In the cholestatic pattern, there is a disruption in the bile secretion mechanism with retention of bile in hepatocytes. Cholestatic liver injury can be intrahepatic, as in sex hormone cholestasis, or extrahepatic, as in choledocholithiasis or cholangiocarcinoma. Identifying the type of hepatocyte damage is valuable for diagnosis, assessment of prognosis, and selection of treatment.",,"Sherlock, S.",1982,,,0,0,

We investigated D-penicillamine in the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. In a prospective double-blind study, 26 patients received D-penicillamine (250 mg four times a day) and 26 an identical placebo. Although the desired urinary copper excretion was achieved in patients taking D-penicillamine, there was no improvement in survival or symptoms at 28 months. Serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase increased equally in both groups. Alanine and aspartate aminotransferases were lower in the D-penicillamine group, but serum albumin was also lower in this group. Liver histology deteriorated equally in both groups. Serious side effects, some occurring more than 24 months after starting treatment, occurred in 31 percent of patients who received D-penicillamine. Less serious side effects occurred in another 46 percent. We conclude that D-penicillamine at the dosage we use is not effective in the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis and is associated with a high incidence of serious adverse events.",,"Matloff, D.

2927,Role of catecholamines in the biochemical mechanisms of the pathogenesis of hepatocerebral dystrophy. [Russian],"The most important parameters of catecholamine metabolism were examined in 48 patients with hepatocerebral dystrophy. Pronounced changes were noted, mainly characterized by a significant reduction in the excretion of dopamine and norepinephrine and an increase in the excretion of their immediate precursor, ie DOPA. Based on the data obtained, it was assumed that the synthesis of these neurotransmitting catecholamines was inhibited. In the course of treatment with d-penicillamine, which is able to mobilize copper and stimulate its excretion from the body, a statistically significant increase in the excretion of dopamine (compared to its baseline level) was noted, and in patients with severe rigid arrhythmohyperkinetic form of the disease was not only increases the excretion of dopamine, but also of norepinephrine. The catecholamine metabolism disorders in hepatocerebral dystrophy are believed to have a complicated mechanism and are associated with both the severe liver pathology and copper metabolism disorders. In this regard, additional methods of treating this disease are offered. These methods influence the catecholamine metabolism and act primarily on extrapyramidal motor disorders, but also on mental disorders. The studies conducted by the author contribute to the existing concepts of the biochemical mechanisms of the pathogenesis of hepatocerebral dystrophy and expand the treatment options of the severe hereditary disease.",,"Barkhatova, V.

Diagnosis was suggested by the presence of fatty liver and nonspecific chronic hepatitis on liver biopsy and confirmed by copper metabolism studies, including determinations of serum ceruloplasmin and hepatic copper concentrations. Unexplained persistent transaminase elevations in children require clarification by needle liver biopsy. The presence of fatty liver and hepatitis should increase the possibility of Wilson's disease, which can then be confirmed by more specific testing.

As in Wilson's disease, penicillamine has recently been introduced for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. In Wilson's disease, the biliary excretion of copper is reduced. The present study shows that biliary copper excretion is not reduced in primary biliary cirrhosis compared to controls; instead, it may be elevated in some patients. However, compared to a high hepatic copper concentration, biliary copper excretion was low. In contrast to copper, the biliary secretion of bile acids was reduced in eight of the 17 patients. Treatment with oral penicillamine (600 mg/day) for one year resulted in a significant decrease in hepatic copper concentration but had no consistent effect on biliary copper excretion or on the amount of histologically staining orcein-positive copper-binding protein. The results suggest that excessive hepatic copper accumulation in primary biliary cirrhosis may not be primarily caused by decreased biliary excretion, or that a new equilibrium is reached in advanced primary biliary cirrhosis.

A brief review of the relevant literature revealed that the dermatological lesions of pemphigus secondary to penicillamine are alleviated by discontinuation of penicillamine and initiation of prednisone therapy. Our patient's primary oral lesions did not resolve with this recommended change in therapy because penicillamine could only be discontinued briefly in the interest of maintaining acceptable serum copper levels and due to the lack of available alternative copper chelating agents. Eventually, the patient was placed on tetraethylenetetramine (TETA), an experimental copper chelating agent, and betamethasone (Celestone). This has resulted in a satisfactory reduction in serum copper levels and resolution of the oral lesions.",,"Eisenberg, E.;Ballow, M.;Wolfe, S.

Administration of D-penicillamine did not result in any significant decrease in these enzyme activities.

Hepatic copper concentrations correlated with urinary copper excretion in cholestasis and treated Wilson's disease, but not in hepatitis or cirrhosis. In treated Wilson's disease, measurement of urinary copper excretion should be valuable in estimating the rate of removal of copper from the body during therapy.

In such cases, proteinuria usually occurs within four to 18 months, but occasionally the onset can be later. The incidence of proteinuria is greater in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and cystinuria (30%) than in patients with Wilson's disease (4%), and its occurrence is related to the mean daily dose of penicillamine and the rate at which this maintenance dose is reached. Rheumatoid arthritis patients who have low serum IgG and IgA levels may be more susceptible, and patients with the DRW2 and DWR3 antigens are more likely to respond to penicillamine or gold, possibly due to the pharmacological properties of the two drugs. Penicillamine is a valuable drug in rheumatoid arthritis and can be life-saving in Wilson's disease and cystinuria.

2951,Ultrastructure of penicillamine-induced skin lesions,"Three cases of D-penicillamine-induced skin lesions, two hemorrhagic and one elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS)-like, were examined by electron microscopy. Elastic fibers were reduced in hemorrhagic lesions. In EPS lesions, elastic fibers were remarkably increased in the papillary and reticular dermis. These appeared as bramble bushes with elastic fibrous patches, as described by Lund. Ultrastructurally, the bramble bush fibers consisted of a nearly normal core and an anomalous mantle that has intermediate electron density and lacks the alternating dense and light layer pattern of normal elastic skin fibers. The ""thorns"" were formed as regular thickenings of this coating material, regularly spaced and perpendicular to the long axis of these fibers. For some fibers, the coating material did not encircle the entire circumference of the nucleus, suggesting that it was applied to the normal elastic fiber after the disease process had started. Elastic fibers in the perforation channel through the epidermis were either intact bramble bush fiber or degeneration thereof. Collagen fibers in both hemorrhagic and EPS lesions stained poorly with routine electron microscopic stains. The most noticeable anomaly was an extreme variation in the thickness of individual fibers ranging from 0.01 µm to 0.05 µm. Stripe pattern and periodicity were normal. Subendothelial separation of vascular endothelial cells in small vessels and actual degeneration of subendothelial elastic fibers (internal elastic membrane) in larger vessels appear to be the basic defect in hemorrhagic lesions. Elastosis perforans serpiginosa appears to be a phenomenon caused by a multitude of abnormal elastic fibers. Obviously in our case they are totally different from the idiopathic ones.

[Russian],Results of determination of plasma levels of non-ceruloplasmin copper in 29 patients with hepatocerebral dystrophy (before and during cuprogogue therapy) and in 15 practically healthy subjects are presented. A statistically significant increase in this level (compared to that in the control group) was found in the patients with Wilson-Konovaloff disease. Clinical improvement in patients with hepatocerebral dystrophy was accompanied by normalization of plasma levels of non-ceruloplasmin copper. From this it can be concluded that this parameter can be used as a criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of the given treatment.,,"Botvinnik, V. S.;Lekar, P. G.;Makarova, V. A.",1981,,,0,0,

This leads to organ damage, which particularly affects the CNS and the liver (copper intoxication theory). Early diagnosis and family investigation are necessary prerequisites. The chemical determination of copper in the liver, for which only 2 mg of liver tissue is required, has become a well-known diagnostic parameter. Cirrhosis of the liver in children and adolescents should be suspected until proven absent. Therapy consists of long-term treatment with DPA; no other drug will do.

We report the use of triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (triene), a new non-sulfhydryl chelating agent, in a girl who was unable to tolerate D-penicillamine despite steroid treatment. The drug has been well tolerated for about 2 1/2 years without side effects.

The liver cells are affected first and then other organ systems. This is how the typical syndromes arise. Despite the extensive literature in recent years, early diagnosis is often not made. Valuable time for therapy is lost as a result, which is particularly harmful for Wilson's disease. This therapy consists of copper withdrawal through long-term treatment with D-penicillamine, restriction of copper supply via the intestine and prescription of the antiresorption agent potassium sulfide in Wilson's disease as in bloodletting in idiopathic hemochromatosis. In this case, treatment with the complexing agent desferriozamine is often dispensed with. The earlier treatment is started, the better the clinical outcomes.

2972,Treatment of Wilson's disease. A report of 30 cases. [French],"Therapy is based on the use of penicillamine, which should be administered very progressively in the initial phase. The usual starting dose is 1.5 to 2 g/day, followed by a maintenance dose of 1 to 1.5 g/day, which should be continued indefinitely. The neurological clinical symptoms developed positively in 21 of 24 patients. Of 18 cases with advanced liver disease, 2 died after 5 and 15 years of treatment from progressive liver damage, and 3 of 8 patients with initially severe cirrhosis died within less than a year of starting treatment with the chelating agent. In 11 of the patients, the Kayser-Fleischer ring had disappeared after an average of 5 years. Hematological and rheumatological manifestations were not affected by the treatment. Three pregnancies were successful. The iatrogenic effects of treatment at an early stage were: worsening of neurological symptoms (4 cases) or thrombocytopenia (3 cases), severe allergic reactions (2 cases) and one case of epileptic seizures. It seems essential to prevent these accidents. At a later stage, 5 nephropathies, 1 case of pemphigus and 2 cases of lupus erythematosus were observed. Although the complications of penicillamine therapy represent a very important practical problem, the serious nature of the spontaneous progression of Wilson's disease justifies the taking of this therapeutic risk. The prognosis depends on the extent of the neurological and especially the hepatic lesions. Early diagnosis is therefore of paramount importance.",,"Pepin, B.;Goldstein, B.;Lidy, C.",1980,,,0,0,

It has been shown that penicillamine significantly reduces the cytotoxic effect of serum from patients with hepatolenticular degeneration. The effect was less pronounced when using the serum of patients suffering from hepatic coma and serum containing exogenous copper salts. There was no reduction in the cytotoxic effect of ammonia. The above observations led to the assumption that the protective effect of penicillamine is only effective in cases where copper is the sole or concomitant pathogenic factor. The partial mitigating effect of penicillamine, found in cultures with exogenous copper-containing serum and in cultures with serum from patients with hepatic coma, is attributed in the former case to an excess of copper salts in relation to penicillamine and in the latter to a joint effect of copper and ammonia, peer pathogenic factors.",,"Mossakowski, M.

The positive correlation of serum zinc levels with the amount of alpha1-globulins, as well as the increase in the latter in Pick's disease, suggest a physiopathology that may correspond to hemochromatosis rather than hepatolenticular degeneration. Confirmation of this hypothesis would require replication of our own results by other research teams, more specific studies of the modalities of zinc transport by plasma proteins, and global assessments of this metal metabolism in Pick's disease.",,"Constantinidis, J.;Richard, J.;Tissor, R.",1977,,,0,0,

3090,Goodpasture's Syndrome and D-penicillamine,"It has recently been suggested that Goodpasture's syndrome could be caused by treatment with D-penicillamine. A patient (51-year-old man) who developed the clinical picture of this syndrome during treatment with this drug is reported. Peritoneal dialysis was required and a renal biopsy was performed. Light microscopy showed several glomeruli that were completely sclerosed and 6 that showed focal proliferative changes with prominent epithelial sickling. Immunofluorescence showed no deposits of IgG or complement components. A thin (1 micron) section did not show the presence of immune complex deposits and therefore no electron microscopy was performed. Clinical features very similar to this patient have recently been described in patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine. In these cases, the features were attributed to Goodpasture's syndrome and D-penicillamine was implicated as the causative agent. However, linear deposition of immunoglobulin on the glomerular basement membrane was not demonstrated in any of these cases. This is a feature characteristic of Goodpasture's syndrome and its absence should preclude the use of this diagnostic term. For this reason it might be better to describe the disease as ""pulmonary purpura and nephritis"". Nonetheless, circumstantial evidence suggests that D-penicillamine is involved in the described clinical syndrome and this case report is believed to lend credence to the association reported by previous authors.",,"Gibson, T.;Burry, H.

After resolution of the bilateral hyperkinesia, low doses of D-penicillinamine were administered. The effect of this treatment lasted 3 years after the operation. Conservative therapy had proved unsuccessful. It is assumed that if the genotype is unchanged, electrostimulation tends to reverse the ""persistent pathological status"" and favorably change the phenotype of the patients.

Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease and Wilson's disease with L-dopa resulted in an increase in SGOT, LGOT, and SGPT activity over approximately 2 months, with subsequent normalization of these enzyme activities despite continued therapy. Treatment with guanidine increased aminotransferase activities in patients with ALS. Penicillamine caused a decrease in SGOT and SGPT activities in Wilson's disease.

Severe spontaneous copper-induced hemolysis was noted during the initial hospitalization. Another sister probably has a pre-symptomatic form of the disease.

3100,Stomatitis caused by D-penicillamine. [French],"The authors recall the chemical structure of D-penicillamine, its pharmacological properties and its main indications: Wilson's disease and rheumatoid polyarthritis. Treatment with D-penicillamine can cause digestive, neurological, haematological, renal and skin-mucosal disorders, which are very interesting to study. Apart from early-onset pruritic erythema-type accidents, which appear to be of an allergic nature, these accidents appear late after ingestion of large doses and have a different mechanism: lupus erythematosus syndrome, erosive and lichenoid stomatitis, hemorrhagic detachment of the skin at pressure sores with Formation of epidermal microcysts apparently related to the lathyrogenic effect of the product, bullous eruptions clinically, histopathologically and immunologically identified with pemphigus. The authors describe the case of a 49-year-old woman who had been treated with D-penicillamine for 17 months for rheumatoid arthritis. Pruritic erythema of the face and extremities, appearing at week 5, showed progressively less and less responsiveness to antihistamines. At 14 months, painful, erosive, and keratotic stomatitis developed, which kept pace with treatment and resolved rapidly upon discontinuation of D-penicillamine. Clinically it looked similar to erosive lichen planus but histopathologically it looked very different and there was evidence of acantholysis in the epithelium. It could therefore be atypical pemphigus, and penicillamine seems to be the first drug known to be able to trigger this disease.",,"Kuffer, R.;Noble, J. P.",1973,,,0,0,

Such a change seems to belong to the primary picture of Wilson's disease, since it is known to occur in the asymptomatic form. However, a drug effect could not be completely ruled out since both patients were treated with D-penicillamine. Hemorrhagic diathesis occurs when the liver is secondarily damaged by copper deposits and the hemostatic condition continues to deteriorate.

3103,"Penicillamine, its metabolism and therapeutic applications: a review","Penicillamine has proven to be an excellent therapeutic agent for treating Wilson's disease and cystinuria. However, its use in other disease states such as rheumatoid arthritis remains controversial. This controversy arose mainly because of the greater incidence of drug-induced side effects in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. For the most part, the etiology of these side effects is unknown and it remains imperative that patients receiving penicillamine should be carefully monitored for side effects. Measurements of penicillamine and its metabolites can be a useful adjunct to the laboratory parameters currently used to assess patient response to this drug. The mechanism by which penicillamine exerts its beneficial effects in various disease states is not understood. What is evident, however, is that the thiol group of penicillamine plays a critical role in determining the effects of the drug. It follows that the effect of penicillamine in situ depends on factors such as the physical state of the drug, its disposition in the body and the rate of its metabolism and elimination. Hopefully, as more is known about these parameters, it will prove more practical to speculate on the mechanisms by which penicillamine exerts both its beneficial and harmful effects. A lot of research is still needed to achieve this goal in the near future.",,"Crawhall, J. C.;Lecavalier, D.;Ryan, P.",1979,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bdd.2510010205,0,0,

There is no additional psychiatric therapy. The physical findings are checked after 5 to 7 months of treatment. The evaluation is based on clinical-psychopathometric and psychological test criteria. In 4 of the 5 patients, the transitional syndrome is over after 5 to 7 months. In the treatment part of HAWIE, a clear increase in the values compared to the initial examinations (between 14 and 27 IQ points) corresponds to the above results. Only in one patient does the clinical picture improve with a 7-month delay.

3107,Treatment of inflammatory and metal storage diseases of the liver,"No specific drug therapy is indicated for chronic persistent hepatitis, since the prognosis for this disease is consistently favorable. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants have been used in chronic active hepatitis for 20 years, and most controlled studies have shown corticosteroids to prolong life. It is common to start prednisone at 20 or 40 mg daily, decreasing the dose as symptoms and biochemical abnormalities improve. Azathioprine alone is no more effective than placebo. However, it has a steroid-sparing effect and allows lower doses of corticosteroids. It is advisable to gradually discontinue therapy only after patients have remained in biochemical and histological remission for at least 6 months. Further studies are needed for the use of transfer factor, interferon and immune stimulation with levamisole. The treatment of symptomatic precirrhotic primary biliary cirrhosis with azathioprine has not proven to be effective. However, there was an improvement in the itching. A preliminary report from the Mayo Clinic suggests that copper chelation therapy with D-penicillamine may be effective, with significant improvement in serum gamma globulin, bilirubin, and IgM levels. Supportive treatment and correction of malabsorption, fluid retention, portal hypertension, and hepatic decompensation is of paramount importance. Pruritus can be relieved with cholestyramine or androgens. Fat-soluble vitamins are administered on a monthly schedule of vitamin A, 100,000 IU, vitamin D, 100,000 IU, and vitamin K, 10 mg. No pharmacological agent has been shown to be unequivocally beneficial in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. The use of corticosteroids has been both advocated and condemned based on a number of controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials. There is considerable evidence that iron is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of idiopathic hemocromatosis. Two controlled studies showed that phlebotomy therapy is effective in terms of survival, liver function, skin pigmentation, and diabetes mellitus. Twice weekly phlebotomies of 500 mL each are recommended, and serum iron concentration should be maintained below 150 µg/100 mL and serum ferritin levels in the low normal range. Chelation therapy with deforroxamine is impractical but can be used when venesecton therapy is not feasible. The cornerstone of therapy for Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is copper removal. The most effective copper chelating agent is D-penicillamine. Numerous studies have shown that patients with this once fatal disease can expect functional recovery from both the hepatic and neurological abnormalities. The starting dose is 500 mg 3 times a day, increasing to 3 to 4 g daily until adequate cupriuresis is achieved. A third of patients develop side effects such as rash, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, arthralgia and lymphadenopathy. Complications of this therapy can be managed by temporary discontinuation followed by resumption with steroid coverage. (Mattar-Sao Paulo)",,"Powell, L. W.;Tolman, K. G.",1979,,,0,0,

The antagonistic effect of zinc sulphate on the absorption of copper with an improvement in the clinical condition was described by Schouwink in 1961 before this patient. The patient had been taking zinc sulfate orally for about 1.5 years at this point. No changes in Kayser-Fleischer rings and ceruloplasmin levels were mentioned.

3121,Toxic Effects of Copper on Cultured Rat Lenses,"Lenses from 60-day-old rats were cultured in Tyrode's medium containing copper sulfate at concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 50 and 100 µM at 35°C for 24 hours. Lenses incubated with 0 or 10 µM copper remained clear. Lenses incubated with 20, 50, or 100 µM copper became opaque, with the opacity increasing with increasing copper concentration and being more intense in the equatorial region than in the central region. Glucose utilization was inhibited, lens sodium and water content was increased, and lens potassium was decreased with increasing copper concentration. At 10 μM, the copper concentration at which opacity was first observed, glucose utilization was inhibited by 20% and the sodium content of the lens increased three-fold compared to control lenses. Copper (100 muM) inhibited the active transport of <sup>86</sup>Rb and increased its passive transport to a much greater extent than it inhibited glucose utilization of cultured lentils. EDTA in the medium offered substantial protection from copper toxicity; D-penicillamine (used to treat copper toxicity diseases) and histidine provided partial protection. Notable clinical implications of these studies are discussed.",,"Coulter, Iii J. B.;Oliver, S. S.;Whitener, C. M.",1978,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0014-4835%2878%2990064-7,0,0,
3122,"Wilson's disease, which presents as chronic active hepatitis","Seventeen patients (8 males and 9 females) with Wilson's disease (mean age 12 years) presented clinical, biochemical and morphological features similar to those of chronic active hepatitis. Neurological dysfunction was evident in only 3 patients (mean age 18 years); Kayser-Fleischer rings were absent in 8 patients and serum ceruloplasmin was normal in 3 patients with severe hepatic impairment. Smooth muscle, mitochondrial antibodies and HBsAg were negative in all patients. Cirrhosis was present in 15 patients at the first liver biopsy. Despite D-penicillamine therapy (1.0 to 3.0 g daily), 4 patients died within 3 weeks after diagnosis of fulminant liver failure associated with hemolysis. Another 5 patients died within 2 years as a result of liver failure (3 patients), variceal bleeding (1 patient) and a lupus-like syndrome (1 patient). Sustained improvement was observed in 8 patients who remained healthy (median survival 7 years) with near-normal liver function tests and inactive liver histology. Patients with Wilson's disease presenting as chronic active hepatitis often present with atypical features: Kayser-Fleischer rings and neurologic dysfunction may be absent, and both serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper may be normal, particularly when there is severe hepatocellular necrosis present. As a result, diagnosis of Wilson's disease can be delayed, and once cirrhosis is established, this form of Wilson's disease can have a poor prognosis despite D-penicillamine therapy. It is therefore essential that the diagnosis of Wilson's disease is ruled out in all patients with chronic active hepatitis and chronic parenchymal liver disease of unknown etiology in order to achieve an optimal response to treatment with D-penicillamine.",,"Scott, J.;Gollan, J.

[German],"Iron, copper and zinc concentrations were measured in postmortem samples of liver, muscle and brain tissue by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The concentrations varied significantly from person to person in normal liver samples, but not in the other organ samples. Copper concentrations in samples from liver cirrhosis were normal in most cases, but at the upper limit of the normal range in about 20% of the cases evaluated. In cirrhosis of the liver, levels of zinc and iron were lower than normal. The mineral concentrations in liver samples from patients with hemochromatosis or Wilson's disease were 10-20 times higher than in normal subjects. Iron overload as a result of therapy (secondary haemochromatosis) and liver changes due to long-term artificially elevated plasma copper levels can imitate the “classic” mineral storage disease mentioned as an adult form.

Bicarbonate (n = 1) and amylase secretion (n = 2) were reduced in two patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The regression of portal hypertension during therapy with penicillamine in one of the latter cases was accompanied by a return to normal exocrine pancreatic function.

Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia have sometimes been attributed to D-penicillamine treatment and its toxicity; However, we have found that cytopenia is a common finding in the available laboratory data from patients with Wilson's disease. Twenty-eight patients (52%) had thrombocytopenia and 16 of these patients (30% of the total) also had leucopenia. Severe, acute, intermittent hemolytic episodes were one patient's initial and only complaint. Six of the patients with significant cytopenias had splenectomy, and in all cases peripheral blood counts returned to normal.

[German],"Although Wilson's disease is one of the longest-known metabolic diseases, the diagnosis is often missed because the clinical picture is very variable. In particular, it is often unknown that the classic neurological syndrome of pseudosclerosis with a corneal ring and clinically silent cirrhosis of the liver usually manifests itself in adolescents or young adults. On the contrary, in childhood Wilson's disease is purely abdominal. This can manifest itself as chronic hepatitis, cryptogenic liver cirrhosis or its complications (ascites, necrotic attacks, gastrointestinal bleeding) or as a hemolytic crisis. The typical lowering of the copper and ceruloplasmin levels in the serum may also not occur. The possibilities of atypical manifestations are described in 3 cases of Wilson's disease diagnosed in the University Children's Hospital in Heidelberg, with the intention of not only helping the patient who is already suffering from symptoms, but also his brothers and sisters who are already suffering from symptoms, through earlier diagnosis and therapy.

None showed neurological abnormalities and only one had Kayser-Fleischer rings (detectable only by slit-lamp examination). Each patient had an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 8 mm/h or less. After 3 and 2 years of D-penicillamine therapy, the condition of both subjects had improved. Liver function normalized in three siblings and no abnormalities developed in the remaining one.

At a typically advanced stage, the disease can be easily diagnosed by findings of the Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring in addition to the clinical features such as neurological manifestation and liver involvement, but many problems regarding the abnormal copper metabolism in Wilson's disease remain. The retention of radioactive copper (<sup>64</sup>Cu) was measured with a whole-body counter in 3 patients with Wilson's disease, 4 of their family members and 2 controls. <sup>64</sup>Cu retained in the body showed high levels in patients with Wilson's disease, possibly reflecting greater copper stores than in normal subjects. The applicability of the retention measurement with <sup>64</sup>Cu as a search test is discussed. Examination of body retention of <sup>64</sup>Cu may be useful as a screening test to distinguish the carrier from normal individuals in the Wilson's disease family.

3148,Treatment of hepato-cerebral degeneration (Wilson's disease). [German],"Among the diseases with extrapyramidal disorder syndromes, hepatocerebral degeneration (synonyms are Wilson's disease and Strumpell-Westphalian pseudosclerosis) occupies a special place, the cause of the problems here being a recessively inherited metabolic disorder. It can be effectively influenced by consistent drug therapy and nutrition. The disorder is quite rare: it is estimated that only a total of 100 patients in the entire GFR require such specific treatment. A fundamental feature of the anti-copper regimen lies in switching to a low-copper diet. If possible, the copper intake should not exceed 1 mg per day. For the past 15 years, D-penicillamine (metalcaptase) has been the drug of choice in the medical treatment of hepatocerebral degeneration. The substance mobilizes the copper stored in the organs and prevents further storage, so that copper is converted into soluble chelated complexes, which can then be excreted through the kidneys. The substance should be administered slowly; as a rule, 0.9 to 1.8 g are required daily. Antagonism between D-penicillamine and vitamin B-6 (pyridoxine) was found in experiments. As a result, latent vitamin B-6 deficiencies have been observed under D-penicillamine therapy. Therefore, an additional dose of 40 mg of vitamin B-6 per day is recommended, especially in patients who showed signs of latent or manifest hypovitaminosis before starting treatment (21 references).",,"Fouquet, H.;Broser, F.",1977,,,0,0,

[Japanese],"Kidney and liver biopsies from 2 patients with abnormal urine findings were examined in addition to electron microanalysis using light, fluorescence and electron microscopy. A 10-year-old boy had cirrhosis of the liver with extensive vacuolar degeneration. A percutaneous renal biopsy was performed twice, before and after administration of D-penicillamine. The kidney showed glomerulosclerosis. Light microscopy revealed a marked increase in the mesangial matrix with slight cell proliferation and focal thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Electron microscopy confirmed these findings, showing electron-dense deposits in the subendothelial areas and the mesangial matrix, and the so-called ""moth-eaten"" appearance. GBM thickening and mesangial interposition were evident. IgG and IgM were present in the glomeruli; IgG and fibrinogen were seen in the mesangial areas. Granular staining of IgG, IgM, IgA and fibrinogen was seen in the mesangium and along the GBM after O-penicillin treatment. On electron microanalysis, a high concentration of copper was evident in the lysosome-like dense bodies in the proximal tubular cells. No copper was recovered from the glomeruli. The second case was that of a 6-year-old boy. IgA was increased in the blood; C<inf>3</inf> and C<inf>4</inf> were normal. The light microscopic finding in the glomeruli was not much different from case 1: Ultrastructural evidence was an increase in the mesangial matrix and a thickening of the GBM. However, the electron-dense deposits and ""moth-eaten appearance"" were absent. Immunofluorescence stained only IgG in the mesangial region and faintly along the glomerular capillary walls. Copper could not be detected. The results lead to some hypotheses. Hyperimmunoglobulinemia and low levels of serum complement components can be caused by liver failure (case 1). Morphologic glomerular changes were apparently not caused by direct accumulation of serum copper as determined by copper microanalysis in tissue; Immunological mechanisms may play a role, although no antigen has been identified. Lysosomes have a specific function in the copper metabolism of the proximal tubular epithelium. It is conceivable that hyperimmunoglobulinemia and low serum C<inf>3</inf> and C<inf>4</inf> levels are involved in the pathogenesis of nephrosclerosis, although they were only found in case 1.",,"Fukunishi, Y.;Fujisawa, S.;Shimizu, S.",1976,,,0,0,

The kidney symptoms of the patients at the time of the kidney biopsy are summarized in a table and the degree of proteinuria is compared with the histological diagnoses in a second table. In all cases a ""mesangioproliferative"" glomerulonephritis somewhat resembling LE nephritis was found. The interstitium contained infiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cells, often with hyaline vacuoles, and foam cells, reflecting lipoid nephrosis. There was no evidence of amyloidosis. Immunohistology was consistent with immune complex nephritis. Transmission electron microscopy showed irregular thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. Neither a diffuse thickening of this membrane, as in typical membranous glomerulonephritis, nor thorn-like protuberances could be found. The mesangial matrix was widened by increased cell proliferation. The scanning electron microscope showed partial shrinkage and distortion of the podocyte processes by bud-like or shell-like outgrowths, particularly in cases of severe proteinuria. Podocytic changes are probably not specific. The clinical course of the disease was favorable. Due to the kidney biopsies (sometimes clear mesangial cell proliferation and an increase in PAS-positive matrix substances), D-penicillamine glomerulopathy is regarded as a special form of ""mesangioproliferative"" glomerulonephritis, since all glomeruli had usually experienced inflammatory changes and electron microscopy showed relatively strong ones proliferation in the mesangium. This, as well as the declining thickening of the basal membrane due to subepithelial deposits, speaks against classifying this LE-like nephropathy among the typical forms of membranous or perimembranous glomerulonephritis. Etiologically, it is not unlikely that this D-penicillamine glomerulonephritis is a drug-induced immune complex nephritis similar to a golden nephropathy. This assumption is supported by: the immunohistological picture with deposits of IgG and complement, the periglomerular and periarteriolar round cell infiltration and the evident lack of dose dependence. Antibodies against D-penicillamine can be detected, but their pathogenetic significance is unclear. The greater prevalence of kidney damage from D-penicillamine in diseases with normal copper metabolism compared to Wilson's disease may be explained by the fact that D-penicillamine is less immunogenic after chelation with copper.",,"Brass, H.;Genth, E.;Hartl, P.

3169,Skin lesions induced by penicillamine: occurrence in a patient with hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease),"Penicillamine is a metabolite of penicillin, is antigenic and therefore allergenic in humans. However, the undesirable side effects of this drug are related not only to its allergenicity, but also to its effect on connective tissue and possibly chelation of heavy metals. Since side effects are common with penicillamine and the drug is used to treat many diseases, the following case is reported. A 41-year-old patient with hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) who had been treated with penicillamine for 15 years developed small white papules at venipuncture sites in the antecubital fossae and at surgical suture sites. Histologically, these papules showed connective tissue degeneration in the dermis. The changes most likely resulted from the effect of penicillamine on the regeneration of connective tissue at the injury sites. The patient also developed wrinkling of the skin of her face and neck during penicillamine treatment, and these changes were attributed, at least in part, to the effects of this drug on connective tissue.",,"Greer, K.

3173,The diagnostic use of specific anti-procollagen sera. I. Analysis of skin biopsies,"Antisera were raised in rabbits against mature calf skin collagen (type I) and a polypeptide characteristic of calf skin procollagen (type I). The latter peptide is attached to the amino-terminal end of the alpha chains and cleaved off during normal maturation by a specific enzyme, procollagen peptidase. For the present study, procollagen was isolated from the skin of calves with a congenital deficiency of procollagen peptidase, a condition called dermatosparaxis. The antisera against mature collagen and procollagen were made specific by appropriate immunoadsorption methods. These sera show a strong cross-reaction with human dermal collagen and procollagen. While anti-collagen sera produced indirect immunofluorescence staining of the entire dermis, anti-procollagen sera reacted only with the top layer of skin (stratum papillare) of unfixed frozen sections of normal human skin biopsies. Frozen sections of skin biopsies from 50 patients with different diseases were analyzed in indirect immunofluorescence tests with antiprocollagen sera. In 19 cases, material from uninvolved skin areas was also available for examination. Skin of patients with connective tissue diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, scleroderma) reacts like normal skin. Skin from patients with psoriasis vulgaris and lichen planus shows broad subepithelial zones of procollagen fluorescence. Keloids show very weak or no procollagen immunofluorescence in several cases. In 3 cases studied with prolonged local corticoid treatment, a normal procollagen immunofluorescence pattern reappeared. Biopsies from a case of Wilson's disease on prolonged therapy with D-penicillamine and a case of epidermolysis bullosa also lacked reactivity with anti-procollagen sera. Uninvolved skin of all patients showed normal procollagen immunofluorescence. It is concluded that immunofluorescence studies using specific antisera against procollagen provide a simple and accurate tool for the localized analysis of collagen metabolism.",,"Wick, G.;Kraft, D.;Kokoschka, E.

None of the 18 women with Wilson's disease who received penicillamine during 29 pregnancies and gave birth to 29 healthy children experienced an aggravation of their disease during pregnancy. Of two women with Wilson's disease who stopped treatment with penicillamine before or during pregnancy, one showed signs of progressive hepatic decompensation in the third trimester and died of liver disease two years later. The other developed severe hemolytic anemia in the second trimester, seven months after penicillamine was discontinued. It is concluded that penicillamine treatment, continued throughout pregnancy, protects the mother from recurrence of Wilson's disease and poses no risk to the fetus.

3182,D-penicillamine in dermatology: influence on enzymatic activities of human skin in vitro,"By means of an in vitro assay, 6 important enzymatic activities of human skin homogenates were determined after incubation with D-penicillamine in concentrations between 10 -4 and 10 mg/ml, ie 67 × 10 -5 > and 67 mM/l. The following enzymatic activities were recorded: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PDH), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), alkaline phosphatase (AP), acid phosphatase (AcP) and ""leucine -aminopeptidase” (LAP ). A dose-dependent activation by D-penicillamine occurred for G 6 -PDH and AcP activities, a dose-dependent inhibition by D-penicillamine for AP and GAPDH activities. LDH and LAP activities remained unchanged in the presence of D-penicillamine at concentrations up to 10 mg/mL (67 mM/L). From the data of pharmacokinetic studies in rats it can be concluded that in the conditions of treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Wilson's disease in vivo concentrations of D-penicillamine affecting enzymatic activities can be easily reached.

The diagnosis of Wilson's disease can now be made relatively easily without having to wait for the development of the typical and clinically recognizable multi-organ involvement.

3194,Molecular Biology of Copper. A circular dichroism study of copper complexes of thionein and penicillamine,"Chicken liver Cd, Zn-Thionein (metallothionein) was isolated from Cd-pretreated chickens weighing 1500 g. The native Cd,Zn-Thionein contained 9 g atoms of metals per 12,000 g protein. With the addition of Cu(CH<inf>3</inf>CN)<inf>4</inf>ClO<inf>4</inf>, all Cd<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup >2+</sup> have been successfully replaced. 15 g-atoms of Cu<sup>+</sup> from the acetonitrile-perchlorate complex were bound to the protein. Due to the lack of aromatic amino acid residues, thionein has unique UV and circular dichroism properties. The shoulder of the UV spectrum at 250 nm (A<inf>250</inf> x A<inf>280</inf><sup>-1</sup> = 23.9) was extended to 275 nm (A< inf>>250</inf> x A<inf>280</inf><sup>-1</sup> = 1.6). No significant absorption was detected in the visible range. The conformational changes of the protein moiety were much more visible in the circular dichroism spectra. The titration with Cu(CH<inf>3</inf>CN)<inf>2</inf><sup>+</sup> caused three new Cotton effects to appear: 257.5 nm (<sup> +</ sup>), 350 nm (+) and 301 nm (-). The negative Cotton effect at 239 nm of the original metallothionein has been completely compensated. The binding strength of copper with thionein is extremely high: it withstands proton treatment up to a pH value of 1.9. Displacement of the Cd 2+ </sup> by Cu <sup> + </sup> using Cd-Thionein formed at pH 2.2 resulted in the same circular dichroism properties as those observed for Cu-Thionein were observed. D Penicillamine proved to be a suitable model for the metal-free thionein, as redox reactions and polymerization of the sterically hindered thiol moiety are known to be slow. The correlation of the circular dichroism properties of either the copper complex using thionein or D-penicillamine was surprisingly high. Circular dichroism measurements of Cu(I)D-penicillamine showed Cotton effects at 255 nm (+), 280 nm (+), and 355 nm (-). Upon examination of the red-violet mixed Cu(I) Cu(II) D-penicillamine complex, cotton bands were seen in the visible at 425 nm (-) and 495 nm (+). In many blue copper enzymes, the copper is thought to be in the vicinity of cysteine and aromatic amino acid residues, which are known to play important roles in electron transfer. This is not the case with Cu-Thionein, which would explain many different properties of this copper protein. It is very attractive to conclude that the sterically hindered SH group of D-penicillamine reacts with excess copper in a specific way, similar to the Cu-thionein. This phenomenon could explain the considerable success of D-penicillamine in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Rupp, H.;Voelter, W.;Weser, U.",1975,,,0,0,

Eighteen died from their disease at an average age of 19.1 years. Kayser-Fleischer rings were present in 37 patients. Splenomegaly and hyperpigmentation of the tibia were noted in half. Bleeding and easy bruising occurred in 17. Less common symptoms or signs included; Edema, arthralgia, jaundice, palpable liver and ascites. Neurological symptoms were common.

Pancytopenia was a common finding correlated with splenomegaly. Hyperchloremia, hypokalemia, and low serum carbon dioxide in association with a fixed urinary alkaline pH were indicative of renal tubular acidosis (RTA).

3205,Lupus induced by D-penicillamine during treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Two cases and immunological study during treatment. [French],"Based on 2 observations of lupus erythematosus induced by administration of D-penicillamine in the course of treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the authors provide a systematic study of the biological features of lupus during such therapy. The first observation was in a 45-year-old woman with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis. At 11 months there was an episode of muscle pain with the appearance of LE cells and antinuclear antibodies. The clinical symptoms disappeared when the treatment was stopped. The second case was a 53-year-old woman with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis who developed a facial rash and the appearance of antinuclear antibodies at 11 months. The rash resolved when treatment was stopped, but subsequent resumption of treatment resulted in recurrence of the rash and antinuclear antibodies. In the systematic study of 25 patients (including the 2 described above), using indirect immunofluorescence on liver sections, the authors found that antinuclear antibodies were initially absent in 15 patients. During treatment, 10 of these negative cases became positive, usually to a small extent. Of the 10 initially positive cases, 3 became negative during treatment and 3 increased significantly. Using the latex agglutination test, it was demonstrated that all 25 patients lacked anti-DPN antibodies. The observations are comparable to those described in the literature for the treatment of Wilson's disease or cystinuria. The absence of immunological abnormalities before treatment in the two cases described indicates that the lupus was induced by treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The magnitude or frequency of the appearance of antinuclear antibodies in approximately half of the cases during D-penicillamine therapy for rheumatoid arthritis can be compared to results obtained with the use of procainamide or hydralazine. Lupus induced by D-penicillamine appears to be quite rare, even in cases of rheumatoid arthritis in which antinuclear antibodies are positive. The presence of such antibodies does not appear to be sufficient to contraindicate the use of D-penicillamine for rheumatoid arthritis.",,"Crouzet, J.;Camus, J. P.;Leca, A. P.;Guillien, P.;Lievre, J.

A Kayser-Fleischer ring is always present at the first neurological signs, which makes diagnosis easy. Although treatment with penicillamine has significantly improved neurological prognosis, its effect on larger liver lesions is less clear and tolerability is not always perfect. Hence the importance of the diagnosis at the pre-symptomatic stage, which can only be done by determining the serum levels of ceruloplasmin in the siblings of the patients, with measurement of the copper levels in the tissues by liver biopsy in patients with low ceruloplasmin levels.",,"Pepin, B.;Haguenau, M.",1974,,,0,0,
3208,The Cure of Chronic Aggressive Hepatitis by D Penicillamine (Slovenian). [Slovenian],"D-penicillamine, which has already proven itself in the treatment of Wilson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma, is now also being introduced in the area of chronic aggressive hepatitis (CAH). A non-specific mesenchymal reaction with increased collagen synthesis is the basic event in both collagenosis and CAH via an indirect blockade of cysteine. D-penicillamine impedes collagen synthesis and the resulting fibroplasia. The previously known contraindications of such treatment are renal insufficiency and disorders of the hematopoietic system. D-penicillamine was administered to 10 patients with CAH who had failed corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs because the liver histology had not improved. In all but 2 patients (all younger than 45 years, their mean age is 29.4 years) there was an apparent subjective improvement and normalization of laboratory findings. Seven patients could be controlled biopsy. In 3 patients the histological picture improved to such an extent that a practical abolition of the pathological process was indicated. In 2 patients signs of aggressiveness disappeared, while one patient remained unchanged and one showed even more aggressiveness in the histological picture. Undesirable side effects in the form of changes to the skin and mucous membranes were observed in 3 patients. A study of D-penicillamine appears warranted, particularly in AuAg-positive patients with CAH in whom corticosteroid or immunosuppressive treatment may be dangerous or in whom such treatment has proved unsuccessful. If changes in the oral mucosa occur, treatment should be stopped immediately.",,"Zaversnik, H.;Acko, M.",1974,,,0,0,

In general, there is little or no evidence of liver involvement and cirrhosis is rare. The Kayser-Fleischer ring is a practically constant sign and pathogen of the disease. D-penicillamine chelation is usually followed by regression of the neurological signs and symptoms of the disease. Its effect on hepatic changes is less certain.

Nine patients did not acidify their urine to pH 5.2 after ammonium chloride challenge. The Tm for bicarbonate was low after bicarbonate administration in only two patients, although the threshold for bicarbonate excretion was apparently reduced in half of the patients (ie excretion greater than muEq/min at a plasma level less than 22 mEq/L). Mean bicarbonate elimination was high with normal plasma bicarbonate levels, but was less than 3% of the filtered load in all but two patients. These data suggest that two patients had type II or proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) and an additional seven had a gradient defect or distal RTA. Bicarbonate wastage was minimal in most patients and could be due to either direct tubular damage or indirectly to the defect in the hydrogen ion excretion gradient.",,"Wilson, D. M.;Goldstein, N.

3231,The pathogenesis and development of Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease can be defined as an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive accumulation of copper, particularly in the liver, kidneys, brain, and cornea, eventually leading to liver disease, abnormalities of proximal renal tubular reabsorption, basal ganglia disease, and the characteristic Kayser -Fleischer's cornea leads rings. The metabolic abnormality is most likely abnormal copper processing by the liver, leading to decreased biliary copper excretion and accumulation of copper in the body. The biochemical nature of the liver defect in copper metabolism is unknown, but removal of copper from the body by chelation therapy is followed by a dramatic reversal of all manifestations of the disease. This response to chelation therapy can be taken as evidence that the clinical and pathological manifestations of the disease are due to the damaging effects of excessive copper deposition in the tissues. A disease concept is presented that explains the variability of clinical manifestations as successive stages in the natural development of the disease. According to this concept, copper accumulates in the liver until a certain critical value is reached. Copper is then released into the blood, followed by progressive accumulation of copper in the brain. After copper reaches a critical level in the brain, neurological disease occurs, and if copper accumulation is not reversed by chelation therapy, progressive neurological disease will terminate the disease.",,"Cartwright, G.

Serum copper, determined by the Cartwright method, was 200 µg% (normal range 80 - 140 µg%). During treatment with Kuprenil (Polish brand of D-penicillamine) 2.0 g daily, urinary copper excretion ranged from 15 to 25 mg in 24 hours.

3237,Trace elements and skin pigmentation,"Of the more than 50 trace elements known to occur in the body, zinc offers the most interesting perspective in its relationship with melanin. Hyperpigmented skin lesions have been reported in patients with abnormalities of trace element metabolism such as Wilson's disease and haemochromatosis. Although high serum copper levels are found in a number of hyperpigmentary conditions, such as xeroderma pigmentosum and melanosis accompanying pregnancy or oral contraceptive use, many other hypercuperemic conditions are not associated with pigment changes. In a recent vitiligo study, there was no evidence of copper deficiency in either skin or serum, while serum zinc levels were significantly reduced. However, any speculation about the role of trace elements in vitiligo would have to take into account the structural defect underlying the lack of melanin. Heavy metals can cause skin discoloration in a number of ways. Melanosis has long been associated with overuse of drugs containing heavy metals such as arsenic, bismuth, gold, or silver. In these cases, there is an increase in melanin in the basal cell layer and in dermal melanophages. Hyperpigmentation from the use of mercury in cosmetic creams is probably more common than previously thought. The particles of the metal itself can contribute to skin color and can often be detected directly in sections. The use of EDTA for skin complications following gold therapy was advocated by Bureau (1967) in light of renewed interest by rheumatologists in prescribing this heavy metal. The authors' results suggest that gold can be retained by the skin for a significant period of time after its administration and such an approach may therefore be justified in patients with a reduced ability to excrete gold.",,"Molokhia, M.

3242,Influence of penicillamine and sodium maleate on acute toxicity and on the distribution of copper in certain organs,"In the course of experiments with female albino rats, it was found that D-penicillamine administered intramuscularly in doses of 20 to 100 mg/kg in acute subcutaneous poisoning with copper sulfate shows a small and unreliable antidote effect, reducing to an insignificant level ( expressed as an insignificant trend) in the copper content in the liver and in the kidneys after a single subcutaneous injection of a sublethal dose of copper sulphate. Sodium maleate administered subcutaneously at doses of 50 to 400 mg/kg decreases (significantly or tendentially) copper levels in the liver and kidneys. At the lower doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg it does not significantly alter the toxicity of copper sulphate, while at the higher doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg it leads to a marked increase in this toxicity. Sodium maleate administered at an ineffective dose of 25 mg/kg does not alter the copper-decorating effect of penicillamine and shows a tendency to potentiate its antidotal effect.

3247,Metals: From Deprivation to Pollution,"Lead and mercury, like many other metals, pose specific health risks: lead, mainly due to ingestion of paint and plaster in slum shelters; Mercury from industrial discharges in inland waterways and in the form of fungicides. The redistribution of such metals in the environment, caused by the activities of a growing population, represents a potential ecological threat for which, in most cases, the data currently available do not allow a credible assessment of the form of biological changes that might eventually occur timescale of their appearance. Gathering such data is an extremely complex task, requiring the collaboration of academia, industry and government, but clearly represents an urgent obligation. The author presents an investigation into the contaminating effects of lead and mercury and outlines the steps required to develop better analytical methods. Proposals presented in this paper include: First, that long-term trends in the redistribution of environmental metals and their rate of build-up need to be studied and forecast, while at the same time local pollution problems need to be studied and identified. Second, the study of the effects of metals on biological systems needs to be expanded and attempts made to develop more sensitive toxicity signals. In particular, the study of the biological consequences of long-term, low-dose metal exposure needs to be promoted, and matrices need to be developed that reflect and allow assessment of metal ion imbalance and associated biological antagonisms. Third, to support such efforts, researchers must strive for even better analytical approaches that are sensitive, fast, and accurate.",,"Ulmer, D. D.",1973,,,0,0,

Comparison of tetrathiomolybdate and trientine in a double-blind study for the treatment of the neurologic presentation of Wilson's disease,"DESIGNA randomized, double-blind, controlled, two-arm study with 48 patients with neurological manifestations of Wilson's disease. Patients received either trientine hydrochloride 500 mg bid or tetrathiomolybdate 20 mg tid with meals and 20 mg tid between meals for 8 weeks. All patients received zinc 50 mg twice daily. Patients were hospitalized for 8 weeks, with neurological and language function assessed weekly; Zinc 50 mg taken 3 times daily and returned annually for follow-up. INSTITUTION Referral to University Hospital. PATIENTS Primarily newly diagnosed Wilson's disease patients with neurological symptoms who had not been treated with an anti-copper drug for more than 4 weeks. INTERVENTION Treatment with either trientine plus zinc or tetrathiomolybdate plus zinc. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Neurological function was assessed by semiquantitative neurological and verbal assessments. Adverse drug effects were assessed using blood cell counts and biochemical measurements. RESULTS Six of 23 patients in the trientine arm and 1 of 25 patients in the tetrathiomolybdate arm experienced neurological deterioration (P<0.05). Three patients receiving tetrathiomolybdate had adverse reactions of anemia and/or leukopenia and 4 had additional transaminase elevations. One patient receiving trientine had anemia as a side effect. Four patients receiving trientine died during follow-up, 3 had shown initial neurological deterioration. Neurological recovery and language recovery were quite good over a 3-year follow-up period. CONCLUSION Tetrathiomolybdate is a better choice than trientine for maintaining neurological function in patients with neurological disorders.

A disturbance in lymphocyte function, which occurs as a side effect of zinc therapy, could lead to serious problems in our patients. We examined the mitogenic response of lymphocytes and natural killer cell activity in patients with Wilson's disease treated with zinc for 5 years or more compared to normal controls and found no differences. In a second study, we examined the same parameters in patients with Wilson's disease before and after one year of zinc therapy and again found no significant differences. We have seen no evidence of immunosuppression or increased susceptibility to infections in our patients who have now been treated with zinc for up to 15 years.

In 16 patients with coronary artery disease but no history of myocardial infarction (MI) (mean age 50 years old, G2); and 3. in 50 healthy volunteers divided into two subgroups by age (mean age 33 years old, G3 and 55 years old, G4). Plasma myosin levels were used to quantitatively estimate the extent of infarct mass. Plasma trace element levels were measured in blood samples after centrifugation and storage at -80 degrees C. The main results were as follows: In G1 patients undergoing thrombolysis, a significant plasma myosin release was measured, with a peak at D6 (1678 versus 95 microU/L at H0). In these G1 patients after MI: 1. A significant increase in plasma copper levels was observed from day 4 to day 10 post-infarction (x1.15 relative to baseline at H0); 2. A decrease in plasma zinc levels was observed and was maximal 12 hours after the start of thrombolytic treatment; 3. A decrease in selenium concentration was observed in both G1 and G2 patients compared to controls (80% of G3 and G4 values); and 4. A significant decrease in plasma iron levels was observed in G1 (67.8% of G3 and G4 control values) and was significant from H0 to day 7 (p<0.01). In conclusion, this study underscores the evolution over time of plasma trace element levels in the follow-up of patients undergoing thrombolysis after MI and the possible prognostic implications of such fluctuations.",,"Pucheu, S;Coudray, C;Vanzetto, G;Favier, A;Machecourt, J;Leiris, J",1995,,10.1007/BF02790115,0,0,
3254,Role of vitamin E supplementation on serum levels of copper and zinc in patients with hemolytic anemia and G6PD deficiency,"Vitamin E scavenges free radicals and can prevent the destruction of RBC in hemolytic anemia with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, in which changes in copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) as additional factors can contribute to hemolysis . In the present study, changes in serum Cu and Zn and the role of vitamin E supplementation in these changes were observed in patients with hemolytic anemia and G6PD deficiency. This study was conducted from July 2005 to June 2006 at the Department of Physiology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) in Dhaka. For this purpose, 102 subjects between the ages of 5 and 40 of both sexes were included in the study. Among them were 68 patients with G6PD deficiency, of whom 34 were in the supplemented group and 34 in the no-supplemented group. The supplemented group received vitamin E at a dose of 800 IU/day for adults and 400 IU/day for children < or = 12 years (4 times daily) for 60 consecutive days. 34 apparently healthy subjects with normal G6PD levels, matched in age and sex, were taken to monitor baseline data (healthy control) and also for comparison. All G6PD-deficient patients were selected from Outpatient Department (OPD) of Hematology, BSMMU, Dhaka, and all healthy subjects from face-to-face contact. The blood G6PD level was determined by a spectrophotometric method and the serum Cu, Zn level by an atomic absorption spectrophotometric method. To monitor the availability of binding proteins, serum total protein, albumin, globulin and the A:G ratio were determined by standard laboratory techniques. All parameters were measured on day 1 of their 1st visit and also on day 60 in deficient groups. The data analysis was carried out using suitable statistical methods. Serum Cu was significantly (p<0.001) higher, but serum Zn, total protein, albumin, A/G ratio were significantly (p<0.001) lower in G6PD-deficient groups compared to those of the healthy control group on day 1. After vitamin E supplementation, the values of these parameters were comparable to those of the healthy control group in the supplemented group at both day 1 and day 60 compared to their pre-supplemented and unsupplemented groups.

3255,Effect of intragastric pH on oral zinc acetate and zinc oxide uptake in young healthy subjects,"METHODS: After a 9 hour fast, 10 healthy volunteers (5 males and 5 females) received a single oral dose of 50 mg elemental zinc as the acetate or oxysalt and under either high or low intragastric pH conditions. A Heidelberg capsule pH detector transmitter was used in all phases to continuously monitor intragastric pH. During the periods of high pH, single oral doses of 40 mg famotidine oral suspension were administered prior to zinc dosing to raise intragastric pH above 5. Intragastric pH < or = 3 was maintained in the low pH phases, the curves for low pH zinc acetate (AL), high pH zinc acetate (AH), low pH zinc oxide (OL), and high pH zinc oxide (OH) was 524, 378, 364 and 66 micrograms xh /dL. The highest plasma concentrations of zinc occurred with the acetate salt at low intragastric pH, while the lowest plasma concentrations occurred with the oxide salt at high intragastric pH. The importance of pH for the dissolution of these salts has been verified by in vitro tests. The 24-hour urinary zinc excretion was highest in the AL phase and lowest in the OH phase. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that intragastric pH and saline solubility resolution are important in the oral absorption of zinc. In particular, the oxide salt is not a suitable zinc salt for use in patients with elevated intragastric pH. BACKGROUND: Zinc is an important nutrient and is necessary to maintain a variety of physiological processes. Mineral supplements that provide physiological doses of zinc can be used when dietary zinc is insufficient. Zinc is also used in pharmacological doses to treat zinc deficiency and diseases such as Wilson's disease and acrodermatitis enteropathica. Although several zinc salts are available, they do not have the same solubility, which is believed to be a key factor in zinc absorption. In addition, the solubility of the salts is influenced by the pH, which can vary between pH 1 and pH 7 under different physiological conditions in the stomach. The objectives of this 2-way, 4-phase, crossover study were to evaluate the effect of high (> or = 5) and low (< or = 3) intragastric pH on the absorption of zinc from the acetate and oxide salt in young healthy volunteers.",,"Henderson, Lm;Brewer, Gj;Dressman, Jb;Swidan, Sz;DuRoss, Dj;Adair, Ch;Barnett, Jl;Berardi, Rr",1995,,10.1177/0148607195019005393,0,0,
3256,Tetrathiomolybdate versus trientine in the initial treatment of neurological Wilson's disease,"Background: The initial treatment of the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease is problematic. Penicillamine, which is used in most patients for years, causes neurological deterioration in up to half of these patients, and half of those patients who deteriorate never recover. Zinc, ideal for maintenance therapy, is too slow for these acutely ill patients. We developed tetrathiomolybdate(TM) for this type of patient and it has performed well in open-label studies. Trientine, another anticopper drug on the market that is approved for patients with penicillamine intolerance, has not been tested in this type of patient. Here we report a double-blind study of TM versus trientine in a patient with neurological Wilson's disease. Design and Methods: The study was a double-blind design in which patients received either TM plus zinc or trientine plus zinc for 8 weeks* Patients were enrolled if they presented with neurological symptoms of Wilson's disease if they had not been treated for more than 4 days weeks with penicillamine or trientine. Patients were followed up at the hospital for 8 weeks of treatment with weekly semi-quantitative neurological and speech assessments to assess possible neurological deterioration. They also had weekly blood and urine tests. On discharge from the hospital, maintenance zinc therapy was continued and they returned for further evaluation at annual intervals for 3 years. Results: 23 patients were enrolled in the Trientine arm and 6 met criteria for neurological deterioration, while 25 patients were enrolled in the TM arm and only 1 patient worsened (p<0.05). One patient on trientine had one adverse event, while 7 on TM had adverse events. All adverse events were mild. Four patients in the Trientine arm died during follow-up, 3 patients showed initial neurological deterioration, 2 patients in the TM arm died. In those patients who did not deteriorate or die, neurological and language recovery was good over 3 years. Interpretation: TM is superior to trientine for the initial therapy of neurological Wilson's disease. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.",,"Brewer, Gj;Askari, F;Lorincz, Mt;Carlson, M;Schilsky, M;Kluin, Kj;Hedera, P;Moretti, P;Fink, Jk;Tankanow, R;Dick, Rb;Sitterly, J",2008,,10.1017/S1748232107000043,1,1,1984.0
3257,Zinc therapy in Wilson's disease and Alzheimer's disease,"Zinc is effective at all stages of treatment of Wilson's disease and is the drug of choice for maintenance therapy. It works by blocking copper absorption in the gut and lacks the side effects of the other two anti-copper drugs. Zinc is approved for maintenance treatment of Wilson's disease in the US, Europe and Japan. We will discuss the appropriate dosing, monitoring, and follow-up of zinc-treated Wilson's disease patients. Because we discovered that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were zinc deficient and that zinc is so important for neuronal function, we conducted a double-blind clinical study of a new once-daily 150 mg gastroretentive zinc tablet marketed by Adeona Pharmaceuticals for 6 months was developed in AD patients. Zinc-treated patients over 70 years of age had statistically significantly better scores than the placebo group in two cognitive assessment systems (ADAS-Cog, p=0.037 and CDR-SOB, p=0.03), suggesting that zinc therapy in elderly patients with AD is effective.",,"Brewer, Gj",2011,,,0,0,1733.0
3258,"An ongoing, multi-center, open-label, Phase 2 study of WTX101 in patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease","Background and Objectives WTX101 (bischolintetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational compound with a novel copper binding mechanism that is being tested in an ongoing prospective study to evaluate safety and efficacy in patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease (WD). Methods Patients with a confirmed WM diagnosis, > 18 years of age and treatment-naïve or treated with chelation or zinc therapy for < 2 years initially received 15 or 30 mg of WTX101 QD and after 6 weeks dosing was based on laboratory and clinical findings Criteria. Regular assessments included safety, liver disease status, neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), and parameters of copper metabolism. Results 28 patients were included in the study. At study entry, most patients were treatment-naïve or treated < 28 days with WD therapy, only 5/28 treated > 90 days. Mean baseline non-ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) was elevated (3.5 mM), 25/28 had neurological manifestations at baseline, and mean UWDRS Part III was 22. Modified Nazer score ranged from 1 to 5. To Adverse events (AEs) included reversible elevated liver tests (n=5, including 3 related to dose escalation per protocol) and neutropenia (n=2). After the starting dose was reduced from 60 mg daily to 15-30 mg QD and dose escalation was limited to 60 mg QD, WTX101 was well tolerated with few AEs. Liver status (ALT, INR, and bilirubin) and modified Nazer score improved or remained stable in all patients. NCC (adjusted for molybdenum) decreased over the course of treatment. Other Cu measurements (exchangeable Cu, total serum Cu, 24-hour urinary Cu excretion) indicate a similar decoppering pattern. UWDRS Part III scores largely improved in patients with neurological manifestations or were stable in patients without neurological manifestations. Daily activity status (UWDRS Part II) showed a similar improvement. Summary WTX101 appears to be safe and well tolerated as initial therapy in patients with WM. Improvements in liver and neurological disorders, copper metabolism and daily activity status have been observed over time with WTX101 treatment. More data will be collected. Conclusion Further clinical evaluation of WTX101 is warranted to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the initial treatment of WD.

3259,"The promise of copper-lowering therapy with tetrathiomolybdate in the cure of advanced, previously incurable cancer and the treatment of inflammatory diseases","Tetrathiomolybdate(TM) complexes copper with protein in a potent three-part complex. This complex with dietary protein is excreted in the stool and causes a negative copper balance. In the blood, this complex of TM, free copper and albumin renders free copper unavailable and non-toxic. TM, developed for Wilson's disease, is very effective for neurological disorders for which no other drug is optimal. Lowering copper to mean levels with TM high enough to avoid clinical deficiency inhibits many cytokines, such as B. those that promote fibrotic, inflammatory, autoimmune diseases and cancer. TM is active in mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis and cirrhosis by inhibiting transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). TM is effective in mouse models of inflammatory diseases involving the liver and heart and in four mouse models of immune-modulated diseases. In humans, TM met both primary endpoints in a one-year randomized controlled trial in primary biliary cirrhosis, an autoimmune attack on the bile ducts. TM shows promise in the disease areas of fibrosis, inflammation and autoimmunity. Wherever steroids are useful, TM will be better and safer. Most excitingly, recent developments show that TM can cure advanced, previously incurable, metastatic cancer. Tumor growth requires angiogenesis (Folkman). Many angiogenic promoters are copper dependent, particularly those active at the micrometastatic cancer level. IMPORTANT NOTE: TM COMPLETELY INHIBITED CANCER GROWTH IN THE HER/2neu MOUSE GENETIC MAMMA CANCER MODEL. Microclusters of cancer cells still present after one year of TM therapy failed to grow due to lack of angiogenesis, while all controls had large cancer cells. Human trials ignored this advice and only tried TM against advanced cancer. These can recruit many promoters, many of which are non-copper dependent, and only modest effects in these studies have led to little interest. Now two US groups are curing metastatic cancer with TM using the mouse's cue. One group requires conventional suppression to no sign of disease (NED), although the disease is considered incurable due to micrometastasis. After three years of TM, the cancer is cured, with 10 different advanced metastatic cancers that have not yet been cured. The second group uses TM and conventional therapy from the beginning, as well as certain therapies that target the metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer, curing many patients with various metastatic cancers. We have initiated a randomized controlled trial of TM in micrometastatic osteosarcoma in dogs. It appears that TM can cure many previously hopeless cases of cancer.",,"Brewer, Gj",2013,,,0,0,1531.0
3260,Zinc monotherapy for young children with asymptomatic Wilson's disease: multicenter study in Japan,"Background and Aims: The AASLD and EASL guidelines recommend zinc monotherapy as treatment for asymptomatic patients with Wilson's disease (WD). However, there have been some reports of zinc monotherapy in young children with asymptomatic WM. Here we aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for young children under 10 years of age with asymptomatic WM in Japanese pediatric centers and to establish appropriate benchmarks for maintenance therapy. METHODS: We conducted a retro- and prospective study to examine 21 children (mean age 6 years, range 1-9) who met the diagnostic criteria for WM and who had pre-symptom onset at 10 participating pediatric centers in Japan exclusively with treated with zinc acetate. No additional WD sequelae such as jaundice, hepatomegaly, or neurological abnormalities were noted. We monitored serum AST and ALT, non-ceruloplasmin serum copper, and 24-hour urinary copper for 1–7 years after initiation of zinc monotherapy. We performed abdominal ultrasound and assessed clinical WM manifestations, drug compliance, and zinc side effects. The prescribed dose of zinc acetate for patients < 5 years was 25 mg twice daily; for these children aged 6 years and older, the dose was 25 mg three times a day. We increased the zinc dose if patients had AST/ALT > 50-70 U/L and decreased it if they had side effects of zinc such as iron deficiency anemia or pancytopenia. Results: At the time of diagnosis, AST/ALT and 24-hour urinary copper were 148+/-118/234+/-151 U/L and 124+/-54 cups/day (5.8+/-2, 9 cups/kg/day), respectively. All patients continued to take zinc with no evidence of zinc toxicity. None of our 21 patients became clinically symptomatic. AST/ALT decreased significantly to 54+/-30/77+/-49 U/L (P<0.001) 1 month after the start of treatment and was mostly maintained below 50 U/L for 1-7 years (AST/ALT: 33+/-7/38+/-17 and 29+/-5/34+/-6 U/l 1 or 7 years after the start of treatment). 24-hour urinary copper decreased significantly to 49 +/- 21 cups/day (2.2 +/- 1.1 cups/kg/day; P<0.001) 6 months after the start of treatment and was mostly below 75 cups /day maintained between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the remainder of the study (2.2 +/- 0.6 and 1.5 +/- 0.2 cups/kg/day 1 and 7 years after the start of the Treatment). Conclusions: Long-term zinc monotherapy for young children with asymptomatic WM has been shown to be highly effective and safe. A reasonable goal in treating young children with asymptomatic WD with zinc appears to be to keep both AST/ALT below 50 U/L and 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day (and below 75 cups/day).",,"Mizuochi, T;Eda, K;Takaki, Y;Iwama, I;Araki, M;Inui, A;Hara, S;Kumagai, H;Hagiwara, S-I;Murayama, K;Murakami, J;Kodama, H",2016,,,0,0,1132.0
3261,Renal functional and structural integrity in infants with iron deficiency anemia: relationship to oxidative stress and response to iron therapy,"Background: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common malnutrition worldwide. The aim of our study was to assess and compare the functional and structural integrity of the kidneys in 50 infants with IDA and 50 healthy controls, and to assess the relationship between IDA and oxidative stress and response to iron therapy. Methods: This was a prospective study in which peripheral blood samples were collected from all study participants and the following laboratory tests were performed: serum iron profile, urinary microalbumin, urinary leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), fractionated sodium excretion (FeNa), total serum antioxidant capacity (TAC), Serum malondialdehyde (MDA), trace elements in serum and urine (iron, copper, zinc, calcium and magnesium). All patients received oral iron therapy and were followed up for 3 months. Results: Baseline urinary marker values were higher in patients with IDA than in controls (p<0.05). Patients had lower pre-therapy TAC and lower serum zinc and magnesium levels than controls, and higher serum MDA and copper levels (p<0.05). MDA levels correlated positively with microalbumin and LAP levels (p<0.05). The LAP concentration in the urine correlated positively with the trace element concentrations in the urine (p < 0.05). A significant decrease in urinary microalbumin, LAP, FeNa and trace elements was observed after iron therapy, while hemoglobin and ferritin levels were increased (p<0.05). Conclusion: In study participants, IDA had an adverse effect on functional and structural renal function that was reversed by iron therapy. Oxidative stress played an important role in the pathogenesis of kidney damage in IDA.

METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients with HLD were divided into 2 groups. Group A (n=60) received Suc 750 mg, po.bid. Group B (n=60) received Pen 250 mg, po qid. The duration of maintenance therapy varied between 6 months and 3 years, averaging 1.5 years. Symptoms and therapeutic effects were assessed using the modified Goldstein scale. RESULTS: The overall efficacy of group A at two different treatment periods was 80% and 85%, respectively, higher than that of group B (58% and 59%, respectively) (P<0.05). Suc also had obvious healing effects for the patients who failed in using Pen. There were fewer side effects in group A than in group B (P<0.05). Suc and Pen can effectively and continuously increase urinary copper excretion. CONCLUSION: Suc is more effective and safer than Pen. Clinically, it may replace Pen as the first-line drug for long-term maintenance therapy of HLD.",,"Ren, M. S.;Zhang, Z.;Wu, J. X.;Li, F.;Xue, B. C.;Yang, R. M.",1998,Dec,,1,1,
3264,Hepatic features of Wilson's disease,"In Wilson disease (WD), defective AT7B function leads to biliary copper excretion and pathological copper accumulation, particularly in the liver and brain, where it induces cellular damage. Liver disease is usually preceded by neurological or psychiatric manifestations. Most patients with neurological or psychiatric symptoms have some degree of liver disease at the time of the disease. Hepatic manifestations of WD can be extremely variable. Patients with clinically asymptomatic WM are often found through family screening or identified through routine laboratory testing. Others may have a clinical picture of chronic active hepatitis or end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis. A minority suffer from acute liver failure, often against a background of advanced fibrosis. Complications from liver disease can be related to portal hypertension, and concomitant liver disease can accelerate the course of liver disease. Liver cancer can occur in patients with WD, most commonly when cirrhosis and inflammation are present. The prognosis of patients with MM is excellent, particularly for those without cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis, but requires timely initiation of appropriate therapy specific to MM and to the patient's non-MM liver disease.",,"Boga, S.;Ala, A.;Schilsky, M.

3265,A comparison of the results of empirical studies on supplemental search techniques and recommendations in review methodology manuals: a methodological review,"BACKGROUND: The purpose and contribution of supplemental search methods in systematic reviews is increasingly recognized. Numerous studies have demonstrated their potential to identify studies or study data that would have been missed by searching bibliographic databases alone. What is less certain is how supplemental search methods actually work, how they are applied, and the advantages, disadvantages, and resource implications of each search method. The aim of this study is to compare current practice in using supplemental search methods with methodological guidance. METHODS: Four methodological guides informing systematic review practice in the UK were read and reviewed to produce up-to-date methodological guidelines. By searching five bibliographic databases, studies were identified that evaluated the use of supplementary search methods. Studies were included if they (1) reported the practical use of a supplemental search method (descriptive), or (2) examined the utility of a supplemental search method (analytical), or (3) identified/investigated factors that affected the usefulness of a supplemental method method when applied in practice. RESULTS: In addition to the four methodological manuals, 35 studies were included in this review. The studies were published between 1989 and 2016, and the publication dates of the handbooks ranged from 1994 to 2014. Five supplemental search methods were reviewed: contacting study authors, citation tracking, hand search, search in study registers, and web search. CONCLUSIONS: There is reasonable agreement between recommended best practices (manuals) and current practice (methodological studies) regarding the use of complementary search methods. The methodological studies provide useful information on the effectiveness of the complementary search methods, often attempting to evaluate aspects of the method in order to improve effectiveness or efficiency. In this way, the studies promote understanding of the supplementary search methods.

3267,Clarifying the distinction between case series and cohort studies in systematic reviews of comparative studies: potential implications for evidence and workload,"It is difficult to distinguish cohort studies from case series. We propose a conceptualization of cohort studies in systematic reviews of comparative studies. The main goal of this conceptualization is to clarify the distinction between cohort studies and case series. We discuss the potential impact of the proposed conceptualization on the evidence base and workload. All exposure-based sampling studies capture multiple exposures (with at least two different exposures or exposure levels) and allow relative risks to be calculated, which should be considered as cohort studies in systematic reviews, including non-randomized studies. The term “allows/can” means that a predefined analytical comparison is not assumed (ie the absolute risks per group and/or a risk ratio are given). Instead, all studies for which sufficient data are available for reanalysis comparing different exposures (e.g. sufficient data in the publication) are classified as cohort studies. There may be a large number of studies that do not compare for the exposure of interest, but a comparison provides the data necessary to calculate effect measures for a comparison. Consequently, more studies could be included in a systematic review. Therefore, the approach outlined can, on the one hand, increase the confidence in effect estimates and the significance. On the other hand, the workload would increase (e.g. additional data extraction and bias risk assessment and reanalyses).",,"Mathes, T.;Pieper, D.",2017,2017-07-01 00:00:00,10.1186/s12874-017-0391-8,0,0,

3269,Wilson's disease: A review for the general pediatrician,"Wilson disease, also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from a mutation in the ATP7B gene that results in impaired hepatic copper excretion and accumulation in various tissues. It is associated with the classic triad of cirrhosis, neurological manifestations, and the ocular finding of Kayser-Fleischer rings; However, the clinical presentation can vary widely, from incidental findings of abnormal liver enzymes to acute liver failure requiring liver transplantation. Pediatric patients may present with subtle findings such as asymptomatic hepatomegaly, transaminitis, behavioral changes, movement disorders, or school failure. The general pediatrician may be the first to recognize these symptoms and should consider Wilson's disease in their differential diagnosis. Wilson's disease can be treated with lifelong chelation or zinc therapy in patients who appear early in the disease; Therefore, pediatricians should have a low threshold for referral to a pediatric hepatologist for further evaluation when there is suspicion.

Interestingly, both TM and WLN are linked to the effectiveness of cisplatin, a widely used cancer drug. Here we show that TM induces dimerization of the metal-binding domain of ATP7B (WLN4) through a unique sulfur-bridged Mo2S6O2 cluster. TM displaces copper ions from Cu-WLN4 and forms a copper-free dimer. Binding of Mo to cysteine residues of WLN4 inhibits platination of the protein. Reaction with multidomain proteins indicates that TM can also join two domains in the same molecule, forming Mo-bridged intramolecular crosslinks. These results provide structural and chemical insight into the mechanism of action of TM against ATPase and reveal the molecular mechanism by which TM attenuates copper efflux protein-mediated cisplatin resistance.",,"Fang, T.;Chen, W.;Sheng, Y.;Yuan, S.;Tang, Q.;Li, G.;Huang, G.;Su, J.;Zhang, X.;Zang, J.;Liu, Y.",2019,2022-01-14 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-08102-z,0,0,

The aim of our study is to determine the performance of REC for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in a population of patients with chronic liver disease. Method(s): Measurement of serum exchangeable copper and relative exchangeable copper was performed in a cohort of patients with Wilson's disease at diagnosis or clinical worsening due to noncompliance (group 1, n=9), one Group of stable WM patients performed (group 2, n=40) and two groups of patients (adults and children) for non-Wilson's liver disease (group 3, n=103 and group 4, n=49, respectively). Result(s): Exchangeable serum copper (N: 0.6-1.1 mumol/L) was significantly higher in group 1 (mean 2.2+/-0.7 mumol/L) compared to the other three groups: Group 2=0.9+/-0.4 mumol/L, Group 3=1.2 +/- 0.4 mumol/L, Group 4=1.1 +/- 0.3 mumol/L (P< 0.05).

Conclusion(s): Our study confirms that the determination of the relative exchangeable copper is a very valuable tool for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

3272,Evaluation of the accuracy of exchangeable copper and relative exchangeable copper (REC) in a mouse model of Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which is responsible for toxic copper overload mainly in the liver and central nervous system. Phenotypic heterogeneity can challenge diagnostic confirmation. Exchangeable copper (CuEXC) has recently been proposed as a new marker for WD and its ratio to total serum copper (Cus), relative exchangeable copper (REC = CuEXC/Cus), as a diagnostic marker. This study aimed to investigate whether this could be confirmed in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice, a genetically engineered WD animal model. Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> (n=137) and wild-type (WT; n=101) mice were examined under the same conditions at 6-8, 20, 39 or 50 weeks of age. Twenty-four Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup>mice aged 39 to 50 weeks received D-penicillamine treatment. Serum and liver data [histology and intrahepatic copper (IHCu)] were evaluated. In the WT group, all serum and liver data were normal. Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> livers developed chronic damage from isolated moderate inflammation (6-8 weeks: 16/33 = 48%) to inflammatory fibrosis with cirrhosis (50 weeks: 25/25 = 100% and 16/25 = 64%). Cus and CuEXC increased by week 39, whereas IHCu and REC were stable with age and much higher than in WT mice (mean +/- SD: 669 +/- 269 vs. 13 +/- 3 µg/g dried liver and 39 +/- 12 vs. 11 +/- 3%). A 20% cut-off for REC provided 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, regardless of gender, age, or D-penicillamine use. Eleven weeks of 100 mg/kg D-penicillamine reduced liver fibrosis (p=0.001), IHCu (p=0.026), and CuEXC (p=0.175). In conclusion, this study confirms REC as a diagnostic marker for WD in a mouse model of chronic liver disease caused by copper overload. Further studies are needed to assess the usefulness of CuEXC for monitoring the development of WD, particularly during treatment. Copyright © 2018",,"Heissat, S.;Harel, A.;Um, K.;Brunet, A.

Tetrathiomolybdate(TM) is a copper chelator used to treat Wilson's disease and reduced the severity of autoimmune arthritis in mice. Aim(s): In this report we evaluated the effects of TM in a mouse model of psoriasis. Method(s): An imiquimod-induced psoriasis mouse model was used. We used immunohistochemical staining and ELISA to determine cytokine levels in inflamed skin, splenocytes and draining lymph nodes. In addition, we used keratinocytes and splenocytes to test the inhibitory effects of TM on cytokine production and transcription factor activation. Result(s): Our results showed that TM significantly reduced cumulative levels, epidermal thickness and Ki-67 expression in inflamed skin. In addition, TM decreased skin cytokine levels and systemic inflammation. Furthermore, TM suppressed activation in keratinocytes and splenocytes with a reduction in phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and STAT3. Conclusion(s): These results provide strong evidence that TM can inhibit psoriasis in models. Copyright © 2018 Japan Society for Investigative Dermatology",,"Hsu, P. Y.;Yen, H. H.;Yang, T. H.;Su, C.

3274,A case report: Co-occurrence of Wilson's disease and oculocutaneous albinism in a Chinese patient,"Rationale: Both Wilson's disease (WD) and oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) are rare autosomal recessive disorders caused by mutations on chromosome 13 and chromosome 11, respectively. Here we report a patient with coexisting WD and OCA who initially presented with episodes of tremor. PATIENT CONCERNS: WD is a disorder of copper metabolism. The main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and brain, leading to hepatic symptoms. OCA is a disorder of melanin biosynthesis characterized by a generalized reduction in pigmentation of the eyes (oculo-), skin (-cutaneous) and hair. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of WM was confirmed by neurological symptoms, metabolic tests, and MRI scans. Interestingly, the patient also had very light complexion, blond hair and eyebrows, and dark brown eyelashes and irises. Because the association of dermatological signs in WM has been rarely reported, OCA has been strongly suspected based on these clinical findings. Genetic analysis was then performed and the results showed that p. (Arg778Leu) mutation in 1 allele and the p. (Asn1270Ser) mutation in the other allele of the ATP7B gene, confirming the diagnosis of WD; the p. (D456fs) mutation in 1 allele and the p. (R299H) mutation in the other allele of the TYR gene, confirming the diagnosis of OCA. Family history was positive for WD, with a 14-year-old younger brother also being diagnosed. Her parents are negative for OCA and WD. INTERVENTIONS: Sodium dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS) was administered during hospitalization. D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate treatment was started after discharge for long-term follow-up. RESULT(S): Postural and intention tremors disappeared and other symptoms and signs improved markedly after treatment. LESSONS: In this study, we reported the first case of a child presenting with WD and OCA at the same time, raising the possibility of a putative link between these two rare diseases.",,"Rao, R.;Shu, S.;Han, Y.

3275,Special Article: Trientine selectively delivers copper to the heart and suppresses pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats,"Dietary copper supplementation reverses pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy through copper replenishment in the heart. A copper-selective chelating agent, trientine (triethylenetetramine [TETA]), also reverses the left ventricular hypertrophy associated with diabetes by increasing copper loading in the heart. The present study was conducted to address the critical question of how TETA transports copper to the heart. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Eight weeks after TAC surgery, cardiac hypertrophy developed and cardiac copper levels were reduced. TETA was then administered by gavage at two different doses (21.9 or 87.6 mg/kg day) for six weeks. The results showed that TETA, at the lower dose, replenished copper levels in the heart, along with a decrease in blood and kidney copper concentrations and an increase in urine. At the higher dose, TETA did not supplement heart copper levels, but significantly increased urinary copper concentrations and decreased blood and kidney copper concentrations. Neither lower nor higher TETA doses changed the copper concentrations in other organs. Consistent with myocardial copper supplementation, the lower dose of TETA suppresses cardiac hypertrophy, as assessed by a reduction in left ventricular wall thickness and a reduction in heart size, and reduced cardiac fibrosis, as reflected by a reduction in collagen I content. TETA at the higher dose not only failed to suppress cardiac hypertrophy, but also caused cardiac hypertrophy in sham-operated rats. TETA-mediated myocardial copper restoration is independent of copper transporter-1 or -2 but is associated with energy-dependent transport. This study shows that low-dose TETA acts as a copper chaperone and selectively delivers copper to the copper-deficient heart through active transport; at higher doses, TETA simply retains its chelating function, stripping copper from the body through urinary excretion. Explanation of Effect: Our study shows that TETA, traditionally considered a copper chelator, selectively delivers copper at lower doses to the heart via a mechanism independent of copper transporter-1 or -2. Copper supplementation with a lower dose of TETA suppresses cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload. Since ischemic heart disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are accompanied by myocardial copper loss, this approach of using a lower dose of TETA to supplement the heart with copper would help manage the disease state of patients with such cardiac events.

3277,Elastosis perforans serpiginosa: causes and associated diseases,"Background: Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is a rare skin disease classified under perforating diseases (PD); a group of dermatoses with transepidermal extrusion of collagen or elastic tissue. Three EPS subtypes have been described, which differ according to etiology, comorbidities, and histopathological features. Here we report a systematic literature review and the case of a 41-year-old woman with Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine (PCM) who developed EPS after 11 years of drug use. Aim(s): Analysis and characterization of EPS subtypes based on an assessment of possible different histological patterns. Material(s) and Method(s): A systematic literature search of Pubmed was performed to identify articles describing EPS. Result(s): A distinctive histological pattern was identified in EPS-PCM-associated patients, either in affected or unaffected skin samples. Using specific elastic fiber dyes (Verhoeff-van Gieson, Weigert, and Orcein), fibers with an irregular surface appeared with spike-like protrusions, likely due to weaker fiber crosslinks, which prevented them from re-expanding after contraction along their length axis. Interestingly, similar histological patterns have also been reported in elastic tissues of the vessel walls of the lung and upper airways, joints, visceral adventitia, and kidney. Conclusion(s): A characteristic histological pattern of PCM-related EPS is observed in affected and normal-appearing skin as well as in extracutaneous elastic tissue, suggesting serious potentially widespread drug-induced systemic elastolytic damage.

3278,Effects of manganese on chronic acquired hepatocerebral degeneration,"Neurological symptoms can be one of the main symptoms in patients with liver cirrhosis. Patients may present with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) with subtle changes in mood or neurological function to more severe symptoms such as stupor and coma. While HE is clinically easy to diagnose in its severe form, more subtle forms can be more difficult to detect. Other neurological diseases can be overlooked in the context of cirrhosis or confuse the doctor when making a diagnosis. Chronic acquired hepatocerebral degeneration (CAHD) is a rare problem occurring in patients with cirrhosis characterized by a Par Kinson-like neurological presentation with brain damage secondary to manganese (Mn) deposition. Here we describe a case of a patient with a neurologic presentation of liver disease with a review of the current CAHD literature. In summary, CAHD is a rare condition associated with liver cirrhosis and should always be considered in patients with neurological manifestations of chronic liver disease.

Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare cause of acute liver failure (ALF). Our aim was to describe clinical features, diagnostic findings, treatments, and outcomes of patients with ALF due to WD. Material and methods. Retrospective review of medical records of all patients with ALF due to WD in eight years in Uruguay. Results. WD was the cause of six (15%) of thirty-nine ALF cases. All patients were women with a mean age of 18 years. Four patients presented with hyperacute liver failure and two with acute failure. Jaundice was the main complaint of all patients. Mean total bilirubin (TB), alkaline phosphatase (AP), AST, and ALT were 27.5 mg/dL, 45.5 IU/L, 156 IU/L, and 51 IU/L, respectively. Four patients had low ceruloplasmin levels, four patients had high urine Cooper levels, and two had Kayser-Fleischer rings. All patients had Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, acute kidney injury, histochemically identifiable copper, and advanced fibrosis on liver histology. The mean MELD score was 36. All patients were treated with D-penicillamine and listed for urgent liver transplantation (LT). Prometheus was performed on a patient. Three patients died: two without LT and one after LT. Three patients survived: one without LT (New Wilson Index < 11) and two with LT. Time to program referral and total time (referral plus wait-list time) were longer for non-survivors than for survivors (14 vs. 3 days and 23 vs. 8, respectively). Conclusion.

3280,Tetrathiomolybdat hemmt die Reaktion von Cisplatin mit humanem Kupfer-Chaperon Atox1,"Cisplatin is a clinically widely used anticancer drug, and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate ([(NH<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf>MoS<inf>4</inf>], TM) is a copper chelating agent , which is used in the clinic to treat Wilson's disease. Recently, TM was found to enhance the therapeutic effects of cisplatin; However, the origin of this effect is not clear. Here we found that TM can inhibit the reaction of cisplatin with Cu-Atox1 and prevent cisplatin-induced protein unfolding and aggregation. Although Ag(i) binds to Atox1 in a manner similar to Cu(i)-Atox1, TM does not prevent the reaction of Ag-Atox1 with cisplatin. This result indicates that the formation of a Mo-centered trimeric protein cluster in the TM-Cu-Atox1 system plays a role in the inhibitory effect. This work provides new insight into the mechanism by which TM enhances the cytotoxic potency of cisplatin and helps circumvent cisplatin resistance of tumor cells.

A cross-sectional study,"BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) can present with various manifestations, ranging from an asymptomatic state to cirrhosis of the liver. Here we aimed to assess clinical presentations and laboratory findings and prognosis in WM cases. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study based on patient records from Inonu University Hospital, Malatya, Turkey. METHOD(S): The medical records of 64 children with MV were reviewed, with an emphasis on the clinical, laboratory, and liver biopsy findings in different clinical presentations. RESULT(S): The mean age at diagnosis was 8.6 +/- 3.26 years (range 3.5-17) and the mean follow-up time was 2.49 years (range 0-9). There were 18 (28.1%), 12 (18.8%), 9 (14.1%), and 6 (9.4%) cases of chronic liver disease, fulminant liver failure, neurological WM, and acute hepatitis, respectively. Nineteen (29.7%) were asymptomatic. The most common signs and laboratory findings were jaundice (45.3%) and hypertransaminasemia (85.9%), respectively. The lowest serum zinc level was found in the fulminant liver failure group (P=0.035). Hepatic steatosis was found in 35% of the 20 patients who underwent liver biopsy. 57.1% of patients with hepatic steatosis were asymptomatic. While 35% showed copper staining, 25% showed iron accumulation in liver biopsies. Nine cases underwent liver transplantation and seven of these had fulminant liver failure (77.8%). CONCLUSION(S): The appearance, symptoms and signs of our cases were similar to those in previously reported series, with the exception of the high proportion of fulminant WM cases. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between zinc levels and the development of a fulminant course and between iron status and WD.

3283,Copper(I) binding properties of copper scavengers used in the treatment of Wilson's disease. Alpha lipoic acid as a potential anticopper,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the P-type copper ATPase, ATP7B, that result in toxic accumulation of copper primarily in the liver and brain. Wilson's disease is treatable, primarily with copper chelation therapy, which promotes copper excretion. Although several decopper scavengers are currently available, their Cu(I) binding affinities have not been characterized quantitatively. Here we determined the Cu(I) binding affinities of five key decoppering agents—D-penicillamine, trientine, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate, and tetrathiomolybdate—by examining their ability to extract them Cu(I) ions from two Cu(I)-binding proteins, the copper chaperone for cytochrome c oxidase, Cox17, and metallothionein. We report that the Cu(I) binding affinity of these drugs varies by four orders of magnitude and correlates positively with the number of sulfur atoms in the drug molecule and negatively with the number of atoms separating two SH groups. Based on structure-activity relationship analysis and determined Cu(I) binding affinity, we hypothesize that the endogenous biologically active substance alpha-lipoic acid might be useful for the treatment of Wilson's disease. Our hypothesis is supported by cell culture experiments in which alpha-lipoic acid protected liver cells from copper toxicity.

A review of publicly available information on rare disease policies and HTA processes was conducted. Experts were called in when information was unclear or missing. Russia has a frequency threshold for its rare disease definition that is five times higher than that of Poland and the Netherlands (both using the EU definition).

3285,Predictors of seizures in Wilson's disease: A clinical radiological and biomarker study,"Background: There are few studies on predictors of seizures in Wilson's disease with neurological manifestations (WDNM), and none have examined the role of copper (Cu)-induced oxidative stress, proinflammatory and excitotoxicity in seizure etiology. Objective(s): To report seizure frequency, refractoryity, and outcome in WDNM. We also evaluate the role of Cu-induced oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and cytokines in predicting seizures. Method(s): Diagnosis of WDNM was based on clinical, MRI, KF ring and 24-hour urinary Cu. A detailed clinical assessment, including severity of WD, occurrence of seizures, seizure semiology, antiepileptic drug (AED), and breakthrough seizures was noted. Cranial MRI and electroencephalography findings were noted. Serum free copper, markers of oxidative stress (glutathione, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde), glutamate, and cytokines (interleukin 6, 8, and 10 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) were measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, spectrophotometer, fluorometer, and flow cytometer, respectively, and correlated with seizures. Patients were treated with zinc with or without penicillamine, and patients with epilepsy were given second-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Outcome(s): Of 110 patients with WDNM, 16 (14.5%) had seizures; focal in 11 (68.7%) and generalized in 5 (31.3%). Patients with seizures had higher serum free copper (35.87 +/- 1.34 vs. 31.72 +/- 0.68; p=0.02), severe dystonia (p=0.04), and more frequent cortical (100% vs. 6.4%; p<0.01) and subcortical (81.3% vs. 20.2%; p<0.01) lesions on MRI compared to those without seizures. Markers of oxidative stress (glutathione, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde), cytokines and glutamate were increased in WDNM compared to controls. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, cortical involvement (OR=105.49; 95% CI=8.74-1272.39; p<0.01) and number of MRI lesions (OR=1.99; 95% CI = 1.11-3.57; p = 0.02) independent predictors of seizure. Seizures were controlled in seven patients each with single and dual AEDs, and two patients required three AEDs. All patients had seizure remission for a median follow-up of 66 (24-180) months. Conclusion(s): Approximately one sixth of WDNM patients experience seizures, particularly in patients with cortical and extensive MRI lesions. Seizures are easily controlled by AEDs.

3287,Advances in the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited neurometabolic disorder that results in excessive copper deposition in the liver and brain and affects children and young adults. Without treatment, the disease is invariably fatal. Although treatments for WD have been available since the 1950s, the disease continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to lack of diagnosis and delayed or inadequate treatment. In this article, we review the WM literature to review recent advances in WM treatment. Method(s): We performed a literature search using the PubMed database for articles related to WM and its medical treatment. We have reviewed the articles and cross-referenced relevant articles to summarize current practices for treating WD. Outcome(s): The survey shows that with proper management of WM in most patients, the liver can be stabilized, even severe neurological disabilities can be reversed, and patients can lead normal lives again. Discussion(s): Medical management of WD includes the use of copper chelators (penicillamine, trientine, dimercaprol, dimercaptopropane sulfonate, and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate) and drugs that decrease gastrointestinal copper absorption. Our knowledge of treatment approaches has benefited from the large systematic clinical trials conducted over the last decade. For each drug used to treat WM, we examined its development, indication for use, dosage, efficacy, and side effects.

Sixteen patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease were enrolled in the study. Patients were analyzed based on their clinical characteristics at presentation and followed for clinical response to treatment. Results The age distribution ranged from 11 to 61 years, with the majority being in the 15 to 30 age group. The majority of patients (68.7%) showed hepatic manifestations. Twenty-five percent of patients had a neuropsychiatric manifestation. Two patients (13%) had both neurological and hepatic manifestations, both presenting with tremor. Three patients were asymptomatic and were diagnosed at family screening. Nine patients (56%) were born of consanguinity. Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring was found in 56% of patients.

The male to female ratio was 1:1 and the median age at diagnosis was 26 (range 18-56) years. Four patients presented with acute liver failure, four with persistently elevated liver function tests, and two with decompensated cirrhosis; none had neurological manifestations. Only one patient had a corneal ring according to Kayser-Fleischer. The median ceruloplasmin level at diagnosis was 0.13 (range <0.03-0.30) g/L, the median 24-hour urinary copper excretion was 2.8 (range 0.3-77.3) µg/L. mol and the median hepatic copper concentration was 789 (range 284-0.30 g/L). 1677) µg/g. At least one mutation in the ATP7B gene was identified in eight patients. The allele frequency of the common H1069Q mutation was 19%. The Leipzig score was &;5 in all patients. Three patients with acute liver failure and two with decompensated cirrhosis successfully underwent liver transplantation. One patient with acute liver failure recovered on chelation therapy as predicted by a Dhawan score <11. D-penicillamine was used as first-line chelator treatment, with subsequent switching to trientine due to side effects in three out of six patients. CONCLUSION(S): The clinical presentation of hepatic Wilson's disease is very variable. Three out of ten patients were diagnosed at an age >35 years. A high index of suspicion in clinically tolerable situations is crucial.",,"Vieira Barbosa, J.;Fraga, M.;Saldarriaga, J.;Hiroz, P.;Giostra, E.;Sempoux, C.;Ferenci, P.;Moradpour, D.",2018,2022-12-17 00:00:00,,1,1,
3293,Hepatic copper accumulation in a young cat with familial variations in the ATP7B gene,"9-month-old intact female crossbreed cat was presented with jaundice, intermittent anorexia and lethargy, elevated hepatic enzyme activity, and hyperammonemia. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography studies revealed that the liver had a rounded and irregular border, and histopathological examination identified an excessive accumulation of copper hepatocytes in the liver. Copper concentrations in both blood and urine were higher than in healthy cats. The patient responded well to treatment with penicillamine. Clinicopathological abnormalities and clinical symptoms improved within 2 months and the patient was alive > 9 months after starting treatment. Genetic testing revealed that the patient and his littermates had a single nucleotide variation (SNV, S. T1297R) that affected the function of the ATP7B gene product; the gene that is mutated in patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Hepatic copper accumulation was thought to be associated with SNV of the ATP7B gene, and the patient had a genetic disorder of copper metabolism corresponding to human WD.

3294,Pediatric case series of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease in children has a varied presentation and can be difficult to diagnose. From 2010 to 2015, three children in the age group of 9-11 years presented with hepatic, neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations at the Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla. Examinations in all three cases revealed defects in copper metabolism that corresponded to those in Wilson's disease. Therefore, this disease should be strongly suspected in children with hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms as it is potentially curable.

3295,Epigenetic changes in the thioredoxin system in the tx-j mouse model and in patients with Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is caused by mutations in the copper transporter ATP7B that result in copper accumulation in the liver and brain. Excess copper inhibits S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase, resulting in variable WD phenotypes through widespread changes in DNA methylation and gene expression. Previously, we showed that maternal choline supplementation corrected higher fetal liver transcript levels of thioredoxin 1 (TNX1) in the Jackson mouse model of toxic milk (tx-j) of WD. Here we examined the effect of maternal choline supplementation on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in fetal tx-j liver by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Tx-j Atp7b genotype-dependent differences in DNA methylation were corrected by choline for genes involving, but not exclusively, oxidative stress. To examine the phenotypic effects of postnatal choline supplementation, tx-j mice were randomized to one of six treatment groups: with or without maternal and/or continued choline supplementation, and with or without copper chelate with penicillamine (PCA) treatment. Hepatic transcript levels of TXN1 and peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) were significantly higher in mice receiving maternal and continued choline with or without PCA treatment compared to untreated mice. A WGBS comparison of human WD liver and tx-j mouse liver revealed a significant overlap of differentially methylated genes associated with ATP7B deficiency. In addition, eight genes in the thioredoxin (TXN) signaling pathway were differentially methylated in human WD liver samples. In conclusion, Ap7b deficiency and choline supplementation in tx-j mice have a genome-wide impact including on TXN system-related genes. These results could explain the variability in WM phenotype and suggest new complementary treatment options for WM. Copyright © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

However, there is no global consensus on the intake and dosage of trace elements in parenteral nutrition for children. This review article provides an overview of the available evidence on the intake and dosage of trace elements in parenteral nutrition for newborns and children. The supply of trace elements in children should be tailored to the child's weight and clinical condition, with a focus on those at risk of toxicity or deficiency. Based on current evidence, there is a need to review the formulation of commercial solutions containing multiple trace elements and allow single trace element supplements to be available for specific indications. The literature supports removal of chromium supplementation while manganese and molybdenum supplementation are discussed. Premature babies may have higher parenteral requirements for iodine, selenium and copper than previously recommended. The routine supply of iron as part of long-term parenteral nutrition is increasingly supported. Further studies on the contamination of parenteral nutrition solutions with trace elements are required for a number of trace elements. Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

3297,Recovery from severe acute liver failure without transplantation in patients with Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is a disorder of copper metabolism that leads to cirrhosis of the liver. WM patients with NWIS > 11 should receive LT; However, we encountered 2 WD patients with a NWIS > 11 who recovered from ALF without LT. The present report aimed to analyze cases of WM patients with high NWIS recovering from severe ALF and the clinical manifestations of the patients and the effects of treatments including zinc (Zn) therapy, chelator therapy, PE , CHDF and LT, to discuss . We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of five patients (male, 2; female, 3) diagnosed with WM along with severe ALF. Complete recovery from ALF without LT was noted in cases 1, 2 and 3. In Case 4, initial recovery from ALF without LT was noted; However, ALF worsened due to bleeding from the esophageal varix. Therefore, the patient eventually required LT. In case 5, recovery from ALF with LT was noted. All cases except case 2 had ALF with maximal PELD/MELD scores >=26 and NWISs >=11 and had indications for LT. In cases of severe ALF with Grade I or II encephalopathy, we recommend evaluating the effects of Zn and chelator treatments during preparation for LT, as the condition may not improve without LT and pediatricians or physicians may ask transplant surgeons to Carry out LT urgently if required.

3298,Morbus Wilson: Ein Update von 2017,"Wilson disease (WD) is characterized by harmful accumulation of copper in the liver and brain. It is one of those rare genetic disorders that has benefited from effective and lifelong treatments that have dramatically changed the prognosis of the disease. In Europe, the clinical prevalence is estimated at 1.2 to 2/100,000, but the genetic prevalence is higher at approximately 1/7,000. Incomplete penetrance of the gene or the presence of modifier genes may account for the difference between the calculated genetic prevalence and the number of patients diagnosed with WM. As expected, the clinical spectrum of WD is broader with mild clinical presentations and late onset of the disease after age 40 in 6% of patients. WD is usually suspected when ceruloplasmin and serum copper levels are low and 24-hour urinary copper excretion is increased. A major diagnostic advance has recently been made with the implementation of direct detection of “free copper” or exchangeable copper (CuEXC). The relative exchangeable copper (REC), which is the ratio between CuEXC and total serum copper, allows a diagnosis of WD with high sensitivity and specificity when REC > 18.5%. In addition, CuEXC values at the time of diagnosis are a marker for extrahepatic involvement and its severity. A value > 2.08 mumol/L indicates corneal and brain involvement (Se = 86%, Sp = 94%), and the disease becomes clinically and radiographically more severe with increasing values. The use of FibroScan<sup></sup> is becoming more common to assess liver stiffness measurements in WM patients. 6.6 kPa is considered the threshold between mild and moderate fibrosis, while a value above 8.4 indicates severe fibrosis. Further studies are now required to confirm the utility of Fibroscan<sup></sup> in the management of chronic therapy in WM patients. Treatment of this disease is based on an initial active and prolonged chelation phase (with D-penicillamine or trientine) followed by maintenance therapy with trientine or zinc salt. The two main problems that can arise are neurological deterioration during the initial phase and non-adherence to treatment during maintenance therapy. Liver transplantation is the recommended therapeutic option for WM with acute liver failure or end-stage cirrhosis; its indication should be considered when the neurologic status is deteriorating rapidly despite effective chelation. Regular clinical, biological, and liver ultrasound follow-ups are essential to assess efficacy, tolerability, and adherence to therapy, but also to detect the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in liver cirrhosis. There is hope for the near future with the introduction of a new chelating agent and copper absorption inhibitor, tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), and the development of gene therapy.

3299,Copper chelators are also relatively effective zinc chelators,"Zinc (Zn) is an essential metal involved in numerous physiological processes. It is required for the catalytic activity of around 100 enzymes and plays a role in protein and DNA synthesis, cell division, wound healing and immunity. Zinc deficiency is characterized by growth retardation, poor appetite, suppressed immune function, diabetes, etc. One of the causes of zinc deficiency can be long-term use of metal chelators, which are mostly non-selective. One such example is copper chelators, used for a rare inherited condition that causes excess copper in the body - Wilson's disease. The aim of this work was to investigate the possible ability of D-penicillamine, trientine and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATM) to bind zinc by a spectrophotometric method based on the competition between the tested compound and dithizone as an indicator. Various physiologically relevant pH values ranging from 4.5 to 7.5 were tested. compound and dithizone as an indicator. Various physiologically relevant pH values ranging from 4.5 to 7.5 were tested. All compounds showed nonselectivity for copper and ability to bind zinc. Experiments showed that the strongest Zn chelating agent was trientine. It can bind about 65% Zn when mixed with zinc ions in a 1:1 molar ratio at pH 7.5. D-penicillamine and ATM showed lower chelating capacity. Surprisingly, all compounds tested showed a higher capacity to form a complex with Zn ions compared to the ability of D-penicillamine to chelate Cu ions. Clinically used copper chelators as well as ATM are also relatively strong zinc chelators and therefore their long-term use can potentially lead to toxicity associated with zinc deficiency.",,"Tvrdy, V.;Karlickova, J.;Hanuscinova, L.;Mladenka, P.",2018,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/intox-2018-0006,0,0,
3300,"Wilson's Disease in Children: A Patient's Perspective on Diagnosis, Treatment, and Adherence and Monitoring","Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive copper transport disease that can present in childhood with a wide range of symptoms (hepatic, neurological, and/or psychiatric). Treatment requires lifelong adherence to a diet and drug therapy. The objectives of the study were to evaluate patient-reported symptoms at diagnosis and treatment. An electronic survey was distributed to 877 WD patients in the WD Association patient network. Of the 124 respondents, 34 were <21 years old: 10 were <10 years old and 65% were female. Most patients were from North America (79%) and were privately insured (65%). The diagnosis of WM was made in two cases before the age of 1 year, in 9 cases between 1 and 5 years, in 12 cases between 6 and 10 years and in 11 cases between 11 and 19 years. The symptoms were mainly hepatic (56%), neurological (21%) and psychiatric (9%). 6/7 patients with neurological disorders had concomitant liver involvement and 2 cases were reported as severe liver disease. All patients with psychiatric presentation had liver disease. Patients are currently reporting treatment with trientine (44%), zinc salts (29%), D-penicillamine (1 patient), and zinc and chelator combination therapy (24%). Only about a third, 32%, remained on the same treatment they originally started on for their WD. 41% changed medication once and another 27% changed treatment more than once. In terms of adherence, 59% reported never missing a dose, 20% once a week, and 21% reported missing a dose more than twice a week, mainly the afternoon dose (82%). The most common reason for non-adherence was forgetfulness (74%), although 41% cited medication side effects as a reason for missed doses. Medicines were obtained from the local pharmacy (44%), by mail order (29%) and from a specialty pharmacy (21%) and others (6%). Interestingly, 53% reported that the pharmacy did not have the drug available on time, and 38% had problems getting insurance approval for their drug. Average monthly expenses were $25-$50. Adherence to a strict low-copper diet was reported by 56%, 36% adhered to some extent, while 8% said they did not restrict their diet at all. 26% received medical follow-up care exclusively from a gastroenterologist, 21% from a hepatologist, 15% from general practitioners, and 48% from a combination of specialists. Blood tests were performed every 3 months in 44%, every 6 months in another 44% and annually in 12% to monitor therapy. The majority (68%) were seen by their doctor at least every 6 months. Quality of life was reported in 62% of affected WM patients. Conclusion(s): WM diagnosed in childhood may present primarily with hepatic symptoms, but neurological or psychiatric symptoms were also present at diagnosis in a minority. Medical therapies changed from initial therapy in the majority of patients, and the reasons for this need to be explored. Medication adherence was challenging for approximately 40% of patients due to patient and non-patient issues. Therefore, improving medication adherence must address patient forgetfulness, treatment side effects, and access to medication.",,"Miloh, T.;Schilsky, S.;Graper, M.;Gonzalez-Peralta, R.;Schilsky, M.",2018,November,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0000000000002164,0,0,
3301,Chelation principles in Menkes and Wilson diseases: choosing the right compounds in the right combinations at the right time,"Dysregulation of copper homeostasis in humans is mainly found in two genetic disorders of copper transport, Menkes disease and Wilson disease, which show symptoms of copper deficiency and copper overload, respectively. However, both diseases are copper storage diseases despite completely opposite clinical pictures. Clinically, Menkes disease is characterized by a copper deficiency, which is due to poor loading of enzymes that require copper, even though there is sufficient copper in the body. Copper accumulates in non-hepatic tissues but is deficient in the blood, liver, and brain. In contrast, Wilson's disease is characterized by symptoms of copper toxicity, which is due to the accumulation of copper in multiple organs, particularly the brain and liver, and a saturated copper pool in the blood. Correcting copper dyshomeostasis in both diseases is challenging, although copper deficiency is the most challenging in Menkes disease. Both diseases are caused by defective copper export from different cells and we would like to present new perspectives and guidelines to improve the treatment of these two complementary diseases. Therapy of Menkes disease with copper histidine, thiocarbamate, nitrilotriacetate, or lipoic acid is discussed. In Wilson's disease, the combination of a hydrophilic chelating agent, e.g. B. trientine or dimercaptosuccinate, with a brain transporter, z. B. thiomolybdate or lipoate discussed. New chelation principles for copper removal or delivery are outlined. Copyright © 2018",,"Horn, N.;Moller, L. B.;Nurchi, V.

3302,Quantitative mapping of trace elements in liver tissue from patients with Wilson's disease determined by X-ray microfluorescence,"Aims: This study was to quantify copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) along with sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P) in hepatocytes and connective tissue in liver sections from patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Micro synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (mu-SRXRF). Second, to generate two-dimensional mu-SRXRF element maps for comparison with histologically prepared sections, and third, to assess whether element distributions are associated. Method(s): Archived liver tissues from twelve patients with end-stage cirrhosis or fulminant WM were examined. Mutations in ATP7B have previously been classified. As a control, seven archived normal liver tissues were examined. mu-SRXRF measurements were performed at the DORIS III storage ring at HASYLAB/DESY (Hamburg, Germany). The two-dimensional element distribution was compared to histologically prepared sections approximately 20-30 m distant from those examined by mu-SRXRF. Result(s): Elemental copper (Cu) could be detected together with Fe, Zn, P and S in all examined liver slices. In WD, Cu was increased by a mean of 20-fold in hepatocytes and 3-fold in fibrotic areas compared to controls. In regeneration nodules, Cu was distributed in a strikingly inhomogeneous manner. The Cu concentrations measured by mu-SRXRF correlated with those measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Strong associations in their regional distribution existed between Zn and Cu or Fe and S. Furthermore, differences in Cu/S between hepatocytes and fibrotic areas were found. An increase in Fe could only be documented in hepatocytes compared to fibrotic areas. With a beam size of 15 x 15 mm, two-dimensional distributions of these elements are morphologically comparable to histological sections at about 25x magnification in an optical microscope. Conclusion(s): mu-SRXRF studies are a valuable tool for quantifying element concentrations in biological tissues and also provide two-dimensional information on element distribution and element association in biological tissues, accelerating the basic knowledge in a summary with biological and clinical data.

3303,Altered zinc balance in the Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse indicates a mechanism of copper toxicity in Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene that affects copper transport in the body. The ATP7B mutation damages copper transporter function, ultimately leading to excessive copper accumulation and subsequent toxicity in both the liver and brain. However, the mechanisms of copper toxicity are not well defined. The Ap7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model is well characterized and exhibits a hepatic phenotype consistent with WD. In this study, we found that the untreated Ap7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice accumulated approximately 2-fold excess hepatic zinc compared to wild-type. We used targeted transcriptomics and proteomics to analyze the molecular events associated with zinc and copper accumulation in the Ap7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse liver. Altered gene expression of the Zip5 and ZnT1 zinc transporters indicated a homeostatic transcriptional response, while increased copper/zinc ratios associated with high concentrations of metallothioneins 1 and 2 indicated altered Zn availability in cells. These data suggest that copper toxicity in Wilson's disease involves effects on zinc-dependent proteins. Transcription network analysis of RNA-seq data reveals an interconnected network of transcriptional activators with an overrepresentation of zinc-dependent and zinc-responsive transcription factors. In the context of previous research, these observations support the hypothesis that the mechanisms of copper toxicity involve disruption of intracellular zinc distribution in liver cells. The translational relevance of this work lies in oral zinc supplementation in the treatment of WD, which is thought to mediate protective effects through the induction of metallothionein synthesis in the gut. This work points to broader implications of altered zinc-copper balance in WD, including global transcriptional responses and altered zinc balance in the liver.

3304,Value of serum zinc in the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of liver disease in children with Wilson's disease,"Objectives: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare congenital disorder of copper metabolism with variable manifestations. To date, there has been no study on zinc (Zn), the antagonist of copper, on WD diagnosis and severity. Our aim was to assess serum Zn in WM and its correlation with disease severity (Revised WM Index). Although ATP7B mutation analysis is highly accurate for WD diagnosis, it may not be readily available in a resource-constrained environment. We proposed a disease diagnostic score (Proposed WD Diagnostic Score) that includes serum Zn. Method(s): Medical records of WM and non-WM children treated at King's College Hospital from 2005 to 2015 were reviewed on the selected parameters using the proposed WD diagnostic score. Available serum Zn data in WM children before disease diagnosis and the calculated severity score were statistically analyzed. The diagnostic values of the Proposed WD Diagnostic Score were evaluated. Result(s): The serum Zn level was significantly lower in 8 WD acute liver failure (ALF) (5.8 [4.1-8.3] mumol/L) compared to 18 WD non-ALF ( 13.5 [6.1-22.2] mumol/L) and 9 ALF of unknown cause (9.8 [7.0-12.1] mumol/L) (P<0.001). Serum Zn significantly correlated with the revised WD index (r = -0.554, P = 0.004). The proposed WD diagnostic score, which included serum Zn level as one of the parameters, had a sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 99.2%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Serum Zn is a new diagnostic parameter and correlates with the severity of WM. The proposed WD diagnostic score is useful while awaiting ATP7B mutation analysis.

3305,Characteristics and prevalence of Wilson's disease: A 2013 population-based observational study in France,"Background and Aims: Few epidemiological studies of the incidence and prevalence of Wilson's disease (WM) have been conducted to date, and the results vary widely by report. The aim of the study was to examine the prevalence, outpatient care and treatments of patients with WM in France. Method(s): Among the 58 million beneficiaries of the universal health insurance scheme (86% of the French population) in 2013, people treated for WM were identified based on hospital diagnosis in 2011-2013 or specific long-term disease status with 100% reimbursement specific healthcare in 2013. Data is from the Sniiram (National Health Insurance Information System database). The prevalence by age and gender was calculated. Result(s): In 2013, 906 prevalent cases were identified, giving a rough prevalence of 1.5 cases per 100,000; 1.65 per 100,000 in males and 1.44 per 100,000 in females. This prevalence is comparable to that found in other population-based studies in European countries and to a study using a similar methodology. Almost 40% of the patients were treated with D-penicillamine and 14.3% with zinc acetate. Trientine, delivered on a compassionate basis, was not available in the reimbursement database. In 2013, 1.3% of patients underwent liver transplantation and 4% had previously undergone liver transplantation in previous years. Fifteen percent of patients received antidepressants, a higher rate than in the general population.

3306,Low serum alkaline phosphatase activity in a teenage girl,"Background: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare and genetic disease that affects bone mineralization. There are currently six forms of HPP, varying in age and severity: perinatal (fatal), perinatal benign, infantile, childhood, adult, and odontohypophosphatasia. Perinatal HPP is most severe and causes death in utero, while adult HPP is milder and associated with pain and osteomalacia. HPP is caused by mutations in the ALPL gene, which encodes tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. One of the cardinal features of HPP is low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Recognition of HPP and differentiation from other causes of ALP activity is necessary for proper diagnosis and treatment. Here we present a clinical case of a 17-year-old girl who presented with fatigue at her annual medical examination. Results from an outside lab showed low daytime cortisol levels. She was referred to endocrinology at her father's request for chronic fatigue and possible adrenal insufficiency. The family history was notable for hypothyroidism and chronic fatigue syndrome. Her medical history was notable for the presence of sub-diagnostic anti-TPO antibodies and a normal TSH. Of note, she was taking folic acid, vitamin B12, and multivitamins. During their initial work-up, laboratory results were notable for low ALP activity (24 units/L; reference range 55-140 units/L). Low ALP activity may be due to Wilson's disease, hypophosphatasia, pernicious anemia, and severe hypothyroidism. Magnesium and zinc deficiencies were once sources of falsely low ALP readings, but current assay formulations include magnesium and zinc to circumvent this problem. Method(s): In order to differentiate the cause of their low serum ALP activity, new samples were collected and the ALP activity repeated. In addition, ALP isoenzyme analysis, sequencing of the ATP7B gene, ceruloplasmin, vitamin B6 (P5P) and urinary phosphoethanolamine quantification were performed. Result(s): The repeat analysis of the patient's serum ALP activity was 23 units/l. An ALP isoenzyme analysis was not possible due to insufficient ALP activity. Initial results showed increased levels of vitamin B12 and normal thyroid function, eliminating pernicious anemia and hypothyroidism from the differential. The patient's ceruloplasmin concentration was quantified as 16.5 mg/dL (reference interval 16-45 mg/dL), prompting further evaluation for Wilson's disease by sequencing of the ATP7B gene, which revealed no deleterious mutations. The concentrations of vitamin B6 and PEA were 95 cups/l; 5-50 cups/l) or (80 mmol/mg Cr; <88 mmol/mg Cr), values consistent with hypophosphatasia. Conclusion(s): Due to the absence of bone abnormalities and impaired growth, HPP was initially considered unlikely; however, the combination of low ALP activity and high vitamin B6 and PEA levels is consistent with a hypophosphatasia diagnosis. Their clinical features suggest a mild form of HPP in childhood or adulthood. This case was complicated by the ceruloplasmin concentration at the lower limit of the reference interval. The diagnosis was also complicated by a later admission that the patient was receiving cortisol from her father to treat her fatigue. The family was advised to discontinue exogenous cortisol and the patient successfully reduced the dose with no evidence of acute adrenal crisis. The family declined genetic testing for the ALPL gene.",,"Shajani-Yi, Z.;Casella, S. J.;Cervinski, M. A.",2017,,,0,0,
3307,Update on the diagnosis and treatment of Wilson's disease,"Purpose of Review: There have been exciting developments related to Wilson's disease (WD) in both basic biological and clinical research. This review critically examines some of these findings and considers their impact on current thinking about WD. It is not a comprehensive review of WM as a clinical disorder. Recent Findings: The structure of the gene product of ATP7B, which is abnormal in WD, is elaborated in detail, together with a more comprehensive description of the functioning of the protein ATP7B (Wilson ATPase) in cells, including enterocytes, not only in relation to copper disposition but also for lipid synthesis. Recent population studies indicate the possibility that WD has incomplete penetrance. Innovative screening techniques can increase detection. New strategies for diagnosing and treating WD are being developed. Several disorders have been identified that could be considered WD mimics. Summary: WD can be difficult to diagnose and treat.

3309,Movement disorders and neurometabolic diseases,"Many inherited metabolic diseases or inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) cause movement disorders in children. This review focuses on chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, tremor and parkinsonism. Broad neurometabolic categories commonly responsible for pediatric movement disorders include mitochondrial cytopathies, organic acidemias, mineral metabolism and transport disorders, neurotransmitter disorders, purine metabolism abnormalities, lipid storage conditions, and creatine metabolism dysfunction. Any movement disorder can be caused by many IEM and some of them can cause multiple movement anomalies. Dietary changes, medications, and increasingly specific therapy can improve outcomes in children with movement disorders caused by IEM. The identification and characterization of secondary movement disorders in children facilitates their treatment and diagnosis, as well as the possible treatment of an underlying IEM.

3310,Dietary copper restriction in a review article on Wilson's disease,"Dietary copper restriction has long been recognized as an important aspect of treatment for Wilson's disease (WD). However, the evidence for this approach is limited. There are no published randomized controlled trials examining this recommendation due to the rarity of the disease and variable presentation. This review summarizes the current knowledge of human absorption and regulation of copper and its relevance to patients with WM. Studies have shown that as the copper content in the diet increases, the amount absorbed decreases. This observation implies that ""copper-rich"" foods, which are generally discouraged for WM patients, would need to be consumed in large quantities to significantly affect intake. Dietary copper restriction is unlikely to significantly reduce the amount consumed and is not only difficult to manage, but unnecessarily restricts food groups and distracts from the provision of substrates essential for improving nutritional status in a nutritionally impaired group. Medical management of WD is effective in compliant patients and allows stabilization of liver disease. Based on current evidence, dietary copper restrictions are unnecessary in stable WM patients adherent to drug therapy, with the exception of two foods (shellfish and liver).

3311,The Hidden Face of Wilson's Disease,"Briefly, the classic form of Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive condition with hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, and systemic manifestations. However, the diagnosis should not be ruled out based on a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. The latest next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies have revealed a gap between phenotype and genetic prevalence and also suggest that WD may still be underdiagnosed. In a majority of WM patients, early detection and appropriate treatment can result in symptom relief and/or improved quality of life. Therefore, the detection of WD is of great importance in patients > 40 years of age or with thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, unexplained bone pain, amenorrhea, repeated spontaneous abortions, or kidney stones. These symptoms can all occur individually or in conjunction with mild to debilitating neurological and/or neuropsychiatric manifestations. While brain lesions of the lens, midbrain, and dentate nuclei are classic, white matter changes and cortical lesions can also be seen: these are often asymmetrical with a predilection for the frontal lobe and, when extensive, a poor prognosis. These lesions are mainly due to copper deposits but may also be related to focal accumulations of other metals such as iron and manganese. A new biological marker called relative exchangeable copper (REC) is making diagnosis and family screening easier. Patient monitoring is important to ensure treatment compliance, efficacy, and tolerability, and to detect rare complications such as copper deficiency caused by chronic copper chelation and hepatocarcinoma in patients with cirrhosis. Currently used treatments are copper chelators and zinc salts. Therapeutic perspectives are liver transplantation, new copper chelators such as tetrathiomolybdate, hepatocyte/tissue transfer and gene therapy.

3312,WTX101 treatment results in a phase 2 and extension study in Wilson's disease: comparing subjects with and without cirrhosis,"Background: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a copper protein binding agent that reduces plasma non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) in Wilson's disease (WD) by forming tripartite complexes with albumin and increasing biliary copper excretion. In a prospective 24-week single-arm phase 2 study in WD, once-daily oral WTX101 rapidly reduced NCC, improved neurological status, and stabilized liver function. Our aim was to compare baseline characteristics and the efficacy and safety of extension at 48 weeks in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic subjects. METHODS: Of 28 WD subjects (18-64 years, 15 female) enrolled in the Phase 2 study, 13 (46%) were identified based on history (biopsy or imaging) or estimates of AST-to- platelet ratio classified as cirrhotic. Of 22 subjects who continued WTX101 in extension, 12 were cirrhotic and 10 were non-cirrhotic. Key parameters monitored for 48 weeks included NCC <inf>corrected</inf> (corrected for copper bound in tripartite complexes), liver status, disability and neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: The mean NCC at study entry was 3.9 muM for non-cirrhotic subjects versus 3.2 muM for cirrhotic subjects. At week 48, mean NCC <inf>corrected</inf> improved to 0.6 and 0.5 mM, respectively. Mean INR was initially higher and albumin lower in cirrhotic patients compared to non-cirrhotic patients, but improved to the normal range by week 48 in both groups. In patients with cirrhosis, the mean MELD score improved from 8.4 to 7.5 at week 48 and the mean modified Nazer score improved from 1.9 to 0.6. In patients without cirrhosis, MELD (7.0 to 7.1) and modified Nazer (1.0 to 0.8) scores remained stable from study entry through week 48. UWDRS disability and neurologic scores improved through week 48 independent of cirrhosis. Eight serious adverse events possibly or probably related to WTX101 through week 48 were similarly distributed in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. Reversible ALT elevations requiring dose adjustments were observed in 5 cirrhotic and 6 non-cirrhotic patients and led to discontinuation before week 24 in 3 non-cirrhotic patients. No ALT elevations requiring dose adjustments were observed in the extension. Conclusion: In summary, treatment with WTX101 at 48 weeks improved copper control with improved or unchanged liver function and a favorable tolerability profile regardless of whether cirrhosis was present or not. Therefore, we conclude that the long-term efficacy and safety of treatment with WTX101 was not affected by the presence or absence of compensated cirrhosis in patients with WM.",,"Schilsky, M.

3313,Contribution of the French registry to the understanding of Wilson's disease,"Aim: To describe patients from the French Wilson's Disease (WD) registry. Background: WM is a rare genetic disorder caused by loss of function of the ATP7B protein, leading to toxic accumulation of copper in the liver and brain. Due to their rarity, patient data are difficult to collect. In France, the WD National Reference Center has a network dedicated to the disease and allows collecting a maximum of data from these patients. Methods: WM patients resident in France will be included in the registry. Data were analyzed at the time of diagnosis and at the last follow-up. The mean age and the clinical forms at the time of diagnosis and the prescribed initial treatments were given. At the last follow-up, mean disease duration, evolution of clinical symptoms and change in treatment were examined. Results: 619 patients (49.1% male) diagnosed between 1959 and 2017 were included in the registry. The mean age at diagnosis was 18.5 +/- 11 years (min. 1; max. 64). 45.8% had a hepatic phenotype, 33.5% had a neurological appearance, and 20.7% were diagnosed by familial screening. In the liver disease group, the main initial clinical signs were jaundice (49%), ascites (12.7%) and edema (6.9%). In the neurological patients, the main initial symptoms were tremor (52.6%), dysarthria (52%), difficulty writing (31%), dystonia (27%), gait disturbance (27%), drooling (23%), and dysphagia (14%). . In the living patients (95.2%), the mean time between diagnosis and last follow-up was 15 +/- 13 years (min. 1, max. 58). 12.8% of the neurological patients had no more symptoms. Persistent symptoms were dysarthria (45.2%), dystonia (40.9%), difficulty writing (23.4%), tremor (21.8%), gait disturbance (19.7%), and drooling (13.3%) . Treatment modifications were made in 42% of patients between diagnosis and last follow-up. Prescribing of D-penicillamine fell from 79% to 37%, while zinc salts and trientine salts increased from 9% to 32% and 6% to 20%, respectively. Bitherapy remained stable (3% vs. 2%), 8.5% had liver transplantation. Side effects that led to a change in treatment were present in 33.7% with D-penicillamine and 14.3% with zinc salts. Conclusions: This cohort is the largest in Europe and represents two-thirds of the WM patients identified in France, as 906 widespread cases were reported in that country in a recent epidemiological study1. This data is fundamental to better understand the disease and improve patient care.",,"Poujois, A.;Girardot, N.;Brunet, A. S.;Lachaux, A.;Woimant, F.",2018,October,,0,0,
3314,Chinese Patients with Wilson's Disease and the Treatments: Exemplary with Intravenous Infusion of Unithiol (DMPS).,"Aim: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of effects and side effects for a series of 136 Chinese patients with Wilson's disease treated with intravenous infusion of unithiol (DMPS) at the University Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine became. Background: In Europe and America, the main therapeutic drugs approved for the treatment of patients with Wilson's disease (WD) are penicillamine and trientine. But trientine is not available in China because the price for patients is so high. The WD patients with penicillamine allergy or intolerance are recommended to take dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) orally in Mainland China, which is safer and cheaper. The main WD specialists in China administer Unithiol (DMPS) intravenously infusions for a few weeks. The authors noted that there is insufficient data on the effects of DMPS infusion on blood routine (WBC, N, Hb, Plt) and liver function (ALT, AST, GGT, Alb). Our goal was to find the effects using data from a single center at Shanghai University Hospital. METHODS: All of these 136 patients had blood tests (WBC, N, Hb, Plt) before and after DMPS and together with liver function tests (ALT, AST, GGT, Alb) before and after DMPS infusion. We performed the analysis with SPSS 20.0. Results: 1. Blood routine (WBC, N, Hb, Plt) had no significant change before and after DMPS treatment (P>0.05); 2. Liver function (ALT, AST, GGT, Alb) had no significant change before and after DMPS treatment (P>0.05); 3. Urinary copper increased 5.5 times. Conclusions: DMPS infusion therapy has effects on blood routine (WBC, N, Hb, Plt) and liver function (ALT, AST, GGT, Alb) in WM patients. In general, DMPS is a safe and beneficial type of treatment for this series of WM patients. However, serious side effects have rarely been reported.",,"Wang, X. P.",2018,October,,0,0,
3315,Targeting GPi: DBS to treat dystonia in a patient with Wilson's disease,"Objective: The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the inner segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) in the treatment of dystonia associated with Wilson's disease (WD). The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of GPi DBS on the cognitive aspects of the disease and to assess the safety of GPi DBS in the specific context of WD. Background: WM is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations affecting the ATP7B copper transporter, leading to copper accumulation in the brain and liver. Common neurological manifestations of WD include dystonia, tremor, ataxia, chorea, and parkinsonism. Of these, dystonia is one of the most difficult to manage. While GPi DBS is a therapy option to manage dystonic symptoms, there is limited data on the use of this therapy to treat WM dystonia. To assess the clinical efficacy of bilateral GPi DBS in the treatment of WD with dystonia, we present a case of a patient with WD implanted with a bilateral GPi DBS and assessed using the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). The patient's dystonia had not improved with zinc acetate treatment administered two years prior to DBS surgery. METHODS: Baseline UWDRS scores were assessed preoperatively and 1 and 2 months postoperatively. Postoperative UWDRS scores were compared to baseline and analysis was performed on neurological, hepatic, and psychiatric subscales. In addition, he underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment as part of his DBS admissions process and will be reassessed 6 months postoperatively to accommodate our secondary endpoint of cognition. Results: Compared to baseline UWDRS scores, his UWDRS total scores improved by 34.48% at his 1-month postoperative assessment and by 45.98% at his 2-month postoperative assessment. The neurological subscore improved by 30.99% and 43.66%, respectively. In addition, the patient's hepatic subscale improved by 37.5% and 50%, respectively. At the 1-month postoperative visit, the patient's psychiatric subscale improved by 62.5% and remained stable at the 2-month postoperative follow-up. Conclusions: While he demonstrated significant improvement on his neurological subscales, improvement on his hepatic and psychiatric subscales likely represents variability in patient self-reports rather than response to DBS. In particular, his responses on the hepatic subscale likely reflect his improved general well-being rather than specific hepatic improvement. Using bilateral GPi DBS to treat WD with pronounced dystonia can be effective in relieving neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Further clinical research should be conducted to further validate the clinical efficacy of bilateral GPi DBS in MV patients with dystonia.",,"Sperry, L.;Duan, X.;Girgis, F.;Denny, K.;Farias, S.;Kahn, D.;Medici, V.;Zhang, L.;Shahlaie, K.",2018,October,,0,0,
3316,Tics in Wilson's disease and review of the literature,"Aim: We report a case of tics in a patient with Wilson's disease (WD). Background: Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that leads to liver failure and neurological deficits. The most common neurological manifestations are cerebellar midline disorders (dysarthria, gait disorders), movement disorders (parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor) and a variety of psychiatric disorders. Tics and stereotyped movements are extremely rare in WD. This article introduces a 23-year-old male with WD who exhibited stereotyped movements. We reviewed all previous cases of WM in the literature that presented with tics (five cases) and stereotyped movements. Methods: Case report and literature review. Results: A 23-year-old man was referred to our clinic because of speech disorders, difficulty chewing, gait abnormalities, and involuntary (see figure) movements. His mother is his father's first cousin. He has two sisters who were healthy and whose blood ceruloplasmin levels were normal. He had stereotyped movements, including left hand raising and forehead touching and elbow flexion, right hand tremors, left foot raising, and circular movements that were voluntarily suppressible for a period of time (video). In addition, there were occasional dystonic movements of his right upper extremity. Bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings have been seen. Blood tests were notable for low ceruloplasmin levels (<0.02 g/LN: 0.22-0.58 g/L). The 24-hour urinary copper excretion was 102 µg/day and 55.9 µg/day (N: 3-35 µg/day) and on the fourth day after administration of 300 mg trientine twice daily the urinary copper excretion was 818 µg /Day. Cranial MRI showed external capsule hyperintensity at T2/FLAIR (Figure 1) and hypointensity of lens shape, caudate nucleus, and bilateral substantia nigra at SWI (Figure 2). Wilson's disease was diagnosed and treatment with trientine 300 mg three times daily was initiated. [Figure 1] [Figure 2] Conclusions: Tics are very rare in WM. There are five other cases with stereotyped movements and tics summarized in the literature in Table. Table 1: Patient characteristics in the literature. [Table 1]. Stereotypic movements and tics are very rare in WM, and awareness of this situation is important because earlier diagnosis and initiation of treatment can improve outcome.",,"Yilmaz, A.

3317,Explosive seizures and new cortical-subcortical lesions in a patient with Wilson's disease,"Aim: We report a patient with stable neurological Wilson disease (WD) who developed recurrent seizures and new cortical subcortical lesions, and discuss the possible causes of the changes. Background: Cortical-subcortical lesions and seizures have been reported in 5-10% and 4-8% of patients with WM, respectively, and are often observed simultaneously. However, their occurrence in a stable patient on treatment has not been reported. Methods: An 8-year-old boy developed progressive dysarthria, gait imbalance, and behavioral changes over 18 months. Examination also revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings, Wilson's faces, and generalized dystonia. He was able to walk independently and keep good grades in school. WD was diagnosed. T2W and FLAIR brain MRIs showed symmetric lesions of the basal ganglia and thalamus; no cortical lesions were present [Figure 1]. With copper chelation (penicillamine gradually increased from 125 mg/day to 1 g/day) there was significant neurological improvement over the next 10 months. By this time, however, he was developing recurring seizures; once every few weeks, but after two months, despite antiepileptic drugs, increasing to multiple seizures per day. He became faint, sleepy, and uncertain. A repeat MRI of the brain one year after the initial scan revealed newly arising patchy lesions in the frontal and parietal cortical-subcortical areas [Figure 2]. The video EEG showed clinical and electrical frontal lobe seizures. Intravenous benzodiazepines and levetiracetam and pulsed methylprednisolone (to reduce cerebral inflammation) were administered and seizures were promptly controlled. Long-term antiepileptic treatment was also intensified. Penicillamine was maintained at 1 g/d. Cognition and balance recovered over the next few weeks. Results: Very frequent or persistent seizures (in conditions other than WD) have been shown to result in acute postictal cortical lesions. Such changes are thought to result from seizure-induced neuronal hyperarousal, increased cellular metabolic demand, and failure of the sodium/potassium ATP pump. In WD, copper deposits in the cortical gray matter increase cellular metabolic stress. We hypothesize that repeated seizures can significantly increase this stress, accelerate cell damage and cell death, and lead to recurrence of cortical-subcortical lesions and even trigger further seizures. Conclusions: Late onset seizures and concomitant cortical lesions may develop in patients with stable WM who are undergoing treatment. We suspect that the seizures may contribute to the development of the lesions. If true, this would suggest that prompt control of seizures can limit such cortical-subcortical lesions.",,"Aggarwal, A.;Munshi, M.;Gadgil, P.;Sanghvi, D.;Bhatt, M.",2018,October,,0,0,
3318,Neurological Wilson's disease: case series on a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency,"Objective: To present two cases of neurological Wilson's disease with two different clinical pictures. Review of the important diagnoses and tests to clarify the rare disease. Highlighting the different medications that can be used for patients with Neurological Wilson's disease. Background: Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder that results in pathological deposition of copper in the liver, brain, cornea, kidney, and heart muscle. Wilson's disease has a prevalence rate of 30 cases per million and is considered a rare disease based on European Commission Public Health criteria. METHODS: Two cases of neurological Wilson disease were reviewed. The first with ataxia and Parkinson's symptoms and the other with dytonic form. Results: Two cases of neurological Wilson's disease with progressive movement disorder and Kayser-Fleischer rings were evaluated with low serum copper, low ceruloplasmin and elevated 24-hour urinary copper against a background of normal liver enzymes. Cranial imaging showed symmetric hyperintensities of the basal ganglia in T2/FLAIR. The 8th International Meeting on the Wilson's Disease Grading System and the Uniform Wilson's Disease Grading Scale have also been helpful in diagnosing and monitoring patients. In both cases, a low-copper diet was a main treatment. Zinc supplementation was also initiated with notable improvements in speech, tremors and limb stiffness. The first case underwent D-penicillamine treatment with slow up-titration of the drug to avoid hematological sequelae and to monitor paradoxical neurological deterioration, while in the second case the patient was kept on zinc supplementation due to a relatively severe initial neurological condition. Treatment should still be individualized as no two patients with Wilson's disease are alike. Botulinum toxin injection may be offered for patients with debilitating movement disorders who do not respond to chelation and medical treatment. Screening of the patient's siblings and monitoring their serum ceruloplasmin is a large part of treatment. Conclusions: Most of the time, these cases go unnoticed and are misdiagnosed due to their rarity and variable presentation. In order to make the diagnosis, a comprehensive investigation is necessary. To date, there is no test, except genetic methods, which alone can be considered diagnostic. As for management, the earlier the intervention is initiated, the better the prognosis for recovery would be. There are several treatment options that should be tailored to each patient with neurological Wilson disease. Because neurological Wilson disease is considered a copper toxicity, prompt diagnostic evaluation and early initiation of treatment is a must.",,"Porlas, R.;De Castillo, L.;Dioquino, C.",2018,October,,0,0,
3319,"Neurological improvement with WTX101 treatment in a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study in Wilson's disease","Aim: The aim of this study was to characterize neurological manifestations in patients with Wilson's disease (WD) and to describe specific neurological changes after 24 weeks of treatment with WTX101. Background: There is a significant unmet need regarding the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of WM treatments. WTX101 (bischolintetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational, first-in-class, once-daily copper protein binding agent that rapidly improved disability and neurological status in a prospective 24-week Phase 2 study in WD. METHODS: Adult patients with WD (treatment-naïve or <=2 years on chelation or zinc therapy) received response-guided individualized WTX101 dosing (15-120 mg once daily) for 24 weeks. Changes in neurological status were characterized using the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: Of the 28 patients included, 25 had neurological manifestations. The mean UWDRS Part II (disability) and III (neurological status) scores at baseline were 6.6 (SD 10.0; range 0-35) and 22.8 (SD 21.0; range 0-83), respectively. By week 24, both the mean [SD] UWDRS Part II score (4.1 [8.2]; p<0.001) and Part III score (16.6 [17.7]; p<0.0001) improved ). There was a highly significant predictive relationship between total Parts II and III scores over time (p<0.0001). The most common UWDRS Part III abnormalities at baseline were postural arm tremor (71%), dysarthria (68%), gait (61%), and limb dexterity and coordination scales, e.g. B. alternating hand movements (71%), finger tapping (57%). , handwriting (54%) and leg mobility (54%). Handwriting and dysarthria were most affected (mean [SD] values 2.0 [0.8] and 1.8 [0.9], respectively). The greatest mean improvements (% change) over 24 weeks were seen in handwriting (51.4%), leg mobility (40.8%), arm postural tremor (39.5%), and alternating hand movements (35.0%). Grouping of total tremor or limb dexterity and coordination showed similar improvements (34.2% and 29.2%, respectively). WTX101 was generally well tolerated and early drug-induced neurological deterioration was not observed. Conclusions: Neurological manifestations were common in this patient cohort with WD. Improved neurological status after treatment with WTX101 correlated with less patient-reported disability. Along with its simplified dosing and favorable safety profile, WTX101 has the potential to fill unmet needs in WD.",,"Bega, D.;Bronstein, J.;Nicholl, D.;Askari, F.;Ala, A.;Ferenci, P.;Bjartmar, C.;Weiss, K.

3320,Copper deposition in oligodendroglial cells in an autopsied case of hepatolenticular degeneration,"We present a case of hepatolenticular degeneration, termed Wilson's disease (WD), in a 31-year-old Japanese man with extensive copper deposition in the liver, kidneys and brain. The liver showed severe cirrhotic changes with macronodular pseudolobulus formation, but there was little difference in the immunohistochemical expression patterns of the copper transporter ATP7B between the control and the present case. In the brain, there were both WD-related lesions, such as Opalski cell scattering, and changes caused by hepatic encephalopathy, including the appearance of Alzheimer's type II glia. Remarkably, we identified copper deposits in the systemic organs, including hepatocytes, renal tubules and in large areas of the brain. Surprisingly, as a result of follow-up, brain copper accumulation was rarely identified in neuronal cells but in Olig2-positive glial cells with double immunohistochemical staining. Taken together, this rare autopsied case suggests a new cellular candidate affected by abnormal copper metabolism and the need for systemic investigation of copper deposition in WM.

3321,Exome sequencing of an adolescent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease identifies a clinically actionable case of Wilson's disease,"Diagnostic sequencing of the entire exome has proven extremely successful in a number of rare diseases, particularly early-onset genetic disorders. For more common diseases, however, exome sequencing for diagnostic purposes remains the exception. Here we describe a patient who was initially diagnosed with a common, complex liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and who, following research-related exome sequencing, was determined to have Wilson's disease (WD). The patient presented as a 14.5-year-old adolescent with chronically elevated aminotransferases, normal ceruloplasmin and a histological examination consistent with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis. He was enrolled in a large longitudinal study of patients with NAFLD and was found to have WD 4 years later by exome sequencing. This new diagnosis, clinically confirmed by 24-hour urine copper quantification, prompted a shift in therapy from lifestyle counseling to targeted treatment with D-penicillamine, a copper chelating agent. In this case, exome sequencing and careful interpretation increased the likelihood of making the correct diagnosis, and thereby selecting the appropriate treatment. This example illustrates the diagnostic utility of exosequencing in more common disorders that are not currently considered targets for genome-wide assessment, and adds to a growing body of evidence that patients diagnosed with more common disorders often actually have rarer genetic syndromes have that have escaped clinical recognition.

3322,Pregnancy in Wilson's disease: management and outcome,"Wilson disease (WD) is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism that results in toxic hepatic and neural copper accumulation. Clinical signs vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic disease to acute liver failure or chronic liver disease with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms. During pregnancy, continued specific medical management for WM is recommended, but reports of pregnancy outcomes in WM patients are sparse. In a retrospective, multicenter study, 282 pregnancies in 136 WM patients were reviewed. Age at disease onset, age at conception, and WD-specific treatments were recorded. Maternal complications during pregnancy, the rate of spontaneous abortion and birth defects were analyzed in relation to medical management during pregnancy. Worsening liver function tests were evident in 16 of 282 (6%) pregnancies and occurred in both undiagnosed and drug-treated patients. Liver function abnormalities resolved in all cases after delivery. Worsening of neurological symptoms during pregnancy was rare (1%) but persisted after delivery. The overall rate of spontaneous abortions in the study cohort was 73/282 (26%). Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of WM who received medical treatment experienced significantly fewer spontaneous abortions than patients with undiagnosed WM (odds ratio: 2.853 [95% confidence interval: 1.634-4.982]). Birth defects occurred in 7 of 209 (3%) live births. Conclusion: Pregnancy in WM patients on anticopper therapy is safe. The spontaneous abortion rate in treated patients was lower than in treatment-naïve patients. Although the teratogenic potential of copper chelators is a concern, the rate of birth defects in our cohort was low. Treatment for WM should be continued throughout pregnancy and patients should be closely monitored for hepatic and neurological symptoms. (Hepatology 2018;67:1261-1269).

3323,High spatial resolution LA-ICP-MS shows massive liver copper depletion in rats with Wilson's disease after treatment with methanobactin,"Wilson disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism that results in systemic accumulation of copper, predominantly in the liver. The therapeutic approach in WM patients is to create a negative copper balance and maintain copper homeostasis, currently through the use of copper chelators such as D-penicillamine (D-PA). However, with late diagnosis, poor adherence to therapy, or treatment failure, mortality is almost certain without liver transplantation. In addition, high liver copper levels are present in WM patients even after years of D-PA treatment. We recently proposed the use of the bacterial peptide methanobactin (MB), which exhibits excellent binding affinity for copper, as a potentially efficient and patient-friendly remedy for copper damage in WM. Here we strongly support these results by showing a significant removal of copper from liver samples from WD rats after short, only 1-week MB treatments. Using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with a spatial resolution of up to 4 m, we show that only small copper hotspots remain in MB-treated animal livers. We also show a lower liver copper concentration in WD rat livers seven weeks after the stopped MB treatment compared to untreated controls. Thus, MB is highly efficient in reducing liver copper overload with a sustained therapeutic effect. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH",,"Muller, J.

3324,The steady-state pharmacokinetics of trientine in patients with Wilson's disease,"Purpose: To determine the steady-state pharmacokinetics of trientine in children (>= 12 years) and adult patients who received trientine dihydrochloride therapy prior to the study. METHODS: Twenty patients were exposed to trientine (trientine dihydrochloride capsules from Univar) following standard oral dosing as part of ongoing therapy. Trientine plasma concentrations were determined before dosing and at 30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 12 h after dosing. Plasma concentrations of trientine were determined by LC-MS/MS using a validated bioanalytical method with stable labeled trientine as an internal standard. Results: Trientine was generally absorbed fairly rapidly with a median Tmax of 1.49 h (range 0.48-4.08 h). There was some variation in exposure, with a 10-fold range in Cmax and a 13.8-fold range in AUC0-t. This variability was slightly less when PK parameters were dose-normalized (6.7-fold range at Cmax/D and an 11.6-fold range at AUC0-t/D). The terminal half-life, which could be defined in 14 of the 20 patients, was largely consistent between patients (range 2.33 to 6.99 h). There was no clear difference in pharmacokinetics between adult patients (n=16) and children (n=4). The Cmax range was 506 to 3100 ng/mL in adults and 309 to 1940 ng/mL in children - the corresponding ranges for AUC0-t were 1240 to 17100 ng/mL h and 1500 to 8060 ng/mL h. When PK parameters were normalized for the administered dose, Cmax/D and AUC0-t/D for children were within the ranges for adult patients. Conclusions: The steady-state pharmacokinetics of trientine in patients with Wilson's disease were broadly similar to those in healthy subjects.

3325,A case report of a successful pregnancy in a woman with Wilson's disease on zinc sulfate,"Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive, rare disorder of copper metabolism. Untreated disease usually leads to subfertility and, in cases where pregnancy does occur, often to miscarriage. However, medications such as zinc salts and penicillamine have led to successful pregnancy outcomes. We report a case of successful pregnancy in a woman with Wilson's disease on zinc sulfate. Case: A 19-year-old woman with Wilson's disease, diagnosed a year ago, presented to us during her first pregnancy. At the time of diagnosis, her serum ceruloplasmin was 27 lmol/L and her 24-hour urinary Cu was 2.28 lmol. AST and ALT were 47 U/L and 54 U/L. Penicillamine was initially started and later switched to zinc acetate 50 mg tds 06 months prior to her presentation. OGTT, liver profile and 2D-ECHO at booking (17+1) were normal. The USS abdomen showed multiple hypoechoic nodules in the liver compatible with changes in Wilson's disease, with no portal hypertension. The morphology scan was normal. Zinc sulfate and folic acid were continued. Her liver profile and fetal growth were normal throughout the pregnancy. She underwent a caesarean section for breech presentation at 37 weeks. The baby (girl) weighed 3650 g and was healthy. Discussion: Zinc is increasingly used to treat Wilson's disease because of its few side effects. It interferes with the absorption of copper from the gastrointestinal tract; Prevention of serous transfer of copper into the blood. Due to its very low teratogenicity, it is often used during pregnancy.

ELISA was performed to analyze the expression of vascular injury factors. Pathological changes in cerebral vessels were observed by HE staining. Immunohistochemical assays were performed to analyze the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and GRP78. Western blotting was measured to analyze the expression of caspase-3, caspase-12, PERK, eIF2alpha and CHOP. Apoptosis was detected using the TUNEL assay. The expression of vascular injury factors and ICAM-1, VCAM-1 was significantly increased by WD and markedly decreased in the GanDouLing penicillamine group. The expression of caspase-3, caspase-12, PERK, eIF2alpha and CHOP was evidently expressed in Wilson group, GanDouLing penicillamine suppressed apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Our results suggest that GanDouLing penicillamine ameliorate cerebrovascular injury through the PERK/eIF2alpha/CHOP ER stress pathway in the mouse model of WD.

3328,"Wilson's Disease: Clinical Practice Guidelines from the Indian National Association for the Study of the Liver, the Indian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the Movement Disorders Society of India","Clinical practice guidelines for Wilson disease (WD) were published by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver in 2008 and 2012, respectively. Her focus was on the hepatic aspects of the disease. A position paper on pediatric WM was recently published by the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition. A need was felt to harmonize the guidelines for the hepatic, pediatric and neurological aspects of the disease and to place them in the context of scarce resources. Therefore, experts from National Societies of India representing 3 disciplines, Hepatology (Indian National Association for Study of the Liver), Pediatric Hepatology (Indian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) and Neurology (Movement Disorders Society of India) came together new develop guidelines. A literature search of retrospective and prospective studies on WM was performed using MEDLINE (PubMed). Members voted on each recommendation using the nominal voting technique. The recommendation, rating, development, and rating system was used to determine the quality of the evidence. Questions were asked about diagnostic tests, the scoring system and its modification to a version suitable for resource-constrained settings. While ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urine copper remain important, serum copper and the penicillamine challenge test play only a minor role in the diagnostic algorithm. A new scoring system - modified Leipzig score - has been proposed, adding additional points for family history and serum ceruloplasmin below 5 mg/dl. The dry liver copper estimate and the penicillamine challenge test have been removed from the scoring system. Differences in pharmacological approaches to neurological and hepatic diseases and global surveillance scales were included. Rising bilirubin and worsening encephalopathy are suggested as indicators predicting the need for liver transplantation, but need to be validated. The clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations for the comprehensive management of WM that are of value to all disciplines.

Our goal was to provide better therapeutic options for patients with Wilson's disease based on the data generated from this study. Methods: We used the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which stores clinical records for nearly 99% of Taiwan residents. The database used is a random sample of two million out of 23 million beneficiaries in Taiwan's NHIRD in 2005. The integrated medical records of these two million cases were collected from 2000 to 2011. Patients with Wilson's disease were identified as those with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 275.1 and the specific prescription medications (including D-penicillamine, zinc, and trientine) in outpatient or inpatient records. Results: During the study period, 66 cases of Wilson's disease were identified. The male to female ratio was 1.75. The mean prevalence rate was 1.81 per 100,000 and the mean annual diagnosis rate was 0.22 per 100,000. Diagnosis was mostly made between the ages of 20–24 and 10–14 years, followed by 25–29 years. Fifty-four of all subjects (81.8%) started treatment with D-penicillamine compared to zinc (12.1%) and trientine (6.1%). Of these 66 cases, 27 (40.9%) had cirrhosis and three (4.5%) underwent liver transplantation due to liver failure. Conclusion: D-penicillamine remains the most popular prescription in Wilson's disease, followed by zinc monotherapy. Although chronic liver damage cannot be avoided, a favorable potential outcome is evident in this population-based study. Copyright © 2017",,"Tai, C. S.;Wu, J. F.;Chen, H. L.;Hsu, H. Y.;Chang, M.

3333,Wilson's disease combined with systemic lupus erythematosus: A case report and a literature review,"Background: Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder in which defective biliary excretion of copper leads to accumulation particularly in the liver and brain. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem disease that can manifest in any system. Cases of concomitant WD and SLE unrelated to penicillamine treatment have been reported rarely. Case Presentation: We report the case of a young woman with typical neuropsychiatric symptoms and laboratory test results of WM. She also had concomitant massive hematuria and proteinuria, fever, multiple positive autoimmune antibodies, hypocomplementemia, abnormal spinal tap findings, and evidence of Sjogren's syndrome, all of which are rare in WM. Therefore, we considered the diagnosis of SLE. Tapering off the steroid dose also confirmed the diagnosis. Conclusion: Wilson's disease and SLE have different clinical manifestations. Here we report a rare case in which both diseases were present at the same time. In clinical practice, in patients with hepatic, neurological and psychiatric manifestations, differential diagnosis of the two diseases is required.

3334,Modulation of tumor chemosensitivity to platinum-based antitumor agents through transcriptional regulation of copper homeostasis,"Platinum (Pt) based antitumor agents have been effective in treating many human malignancies. Drug import, intracellular shuffling, and export—performed by the high-affinity copper (Cu) transporter (hCtr1), Cu chaperone (Ato x1), and Cu exporter (ATP7A and ATP7B), respectively—contribute cumulatively to the chemosensitivity of Pt drugs including cisplatin and carboplatin, but not oxaliplatin. This entire system can also handle Pt drugs via interactions between Pt and the thiol-containing amino acid residues in these proteins; the interactions are strongly influenced by cellular redox regulators such as glutathione. hCtr1 expression is induced by acute Cu deficiency and induction is regulated by transcription factor-specific protein 1 (Sp1), which itself is also regulated by fluctuations in Cu concentration. Copper displaces zinc (Zn) coordination at the zinc finger (ZF) domains of Sp1 and inactivates its DNA binding, while Cu deprivation enhances Sp1-DNA interactions and increases Sp1 expression, which in turn upregulates hCtr1. Because of the shared transport system, the chemosensitivity of Pt drugs can be modulated by targeting Cu transporters. A Cu-lowering agent (trientine) in combination with a Pt drug (carboplatin) has been used in clinical trials to overcome Pt resistance. Future research should aim to further develop effective Pt drug retention strategies to improve treatment efficacy. Copyright © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Lai, Y.

3335,Are there genetic variants to explain the phenomenon of donor cell survival after a blood transfusion?,"Background/case studies: Despite the introduction of leuko-depleted blood components, transplantation of donor leukocytes (transfusion-associated microchimerism (TAM)) has been shown to remain a long-term consequence of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in some patient groups. The mechanism by which donor leukocytes survive after a blood transfusion is unclear, and it has been speculated that genetic factors could be a possible reason. This study was conducted to determine if there is an association between an individual's genetic profile and the establishment of TAM in blood transfusion recipients. Study design/method: Australian trauma patients (n=86) transfused with RBC units between 2000 and 2012, with an injury severity score greater than 15, were recruited. TAM was found in twelve of these patients. To date, whole exome sequencing has been performed on four patients with TAM and four patients without TAM. A comparison of the exome data with the human genome reference sequence arrangement GRCh37 was carried out and an analysis of the differential genetic variations was carried out. Variations unique to at least 50% of patients in each group were further investigated, with a focus on genes associated with immune regulation. Results/Findings: A preliminary analysis was performed. Many of the changes found in 2 of the 4 patients with TAM were present in highly heterogeneous genes, including the zinc finger protein genes and the human leukocyte antigen genes (HLA-B and HLD-DRB1). Some of the most interesting changes were found in genes with unknown function, such as Chr4 70257329 variant ID248066. In addition, alterations were found in the following genes, BTN3A1 gene (Chr6 26405815 variant ID 340887) which plays a role in the regulation and proliferation of T cells and CCL8 gene (Chr 17 32647356 variant ID 847320) which is a chemokine contributes to tumor-associated leukocyte depletion. Conclusion: Next-generation (whole exome) sequencing technologies allow for the exploration of genetic variations across different populations, which may provide clues to possible clues to mechanisms by which TAM may become established in certain patients. This preliminary analysis provides potential genetic changes that could affect genes that play a role in T cell regulation and proliferation. It is expected that further analysis with expanded patient numbers will allow a more detailed examination of this genomic data.

3338,Wilson's disease in 2018,"Wilson disease (WD) is characterized by harmful accumulation of copper in the liver and brain. It's one of those rare genetic disorders that has benefited from effective treatments that have dramatically altered the prognosis. The establishment of a national reference center in 2005, which was re-certified that year, and the enrollment of patients in a national registry have enabled us to make advances in the knowledge and treatment of this rare disease. In France, the clinical prevalence is estimated at 1.5/100,000, but the genetic prevalence is around 1/7,000. Incomplete penetrance of the gene or the presence of modifying genes may account for the difference. As expected, the clinical spectrum of WD is broader, with pauci-symptomatic presentations and late onset of the disease over the age of 40 in 6% of patients. WD is suspected when ceruloplasminemia is low and 24-hour urinary copper excretion is increased. Recently, a major diagnostic advance has been made with the implementation of direct dosing of non-toxic copper, called replaceable copper. The exchangeable copper/total copper (REC) ratio > 18.5% enables the diagnosis of WD with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, a copper exchange value of > 2.08 µmol/L at diagnosis is indicative of the severity of extrahepatic (brain and retina) involvement. Treatment of WD is based on an initial active and prolonged chelation phase (with Trolovol<sup></sup> or Trientine<sup></sup>) followed by a maintenance phase with Trientine<sup></sup> or zinc salt. The two main problems that can occur are neurological deterioration during the initial phase and non-adherence to treatment during the maintenance phase. Liver transplantation is the recommended therapeutic option for WM with acute liver failure or end-stage cirrhosis; its indication should be considered when rapid neurological deterioration occurs despite effective chelation. Regular clinical, biological, and liver ultrasound follow-ups are essential to assess treatment efficacy, tolerability, and adherence, but also to detect the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in liver cirrhosis. The near future is promising with the arrival of a new chelating agent, tetrathiomolybdate, and the development of gene therapy.

3340,Associations between zinc deficiency and metabolic abnormalities in patients with chronic liver disease,"Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element with beneficial antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and apoptotic effects. The liver mainly plays a crucial role in maintaining systemic Zn homeostasis. Therefore, the occurrence of chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis or fatty liver leads to an impairment of the Zn metabolism and subsequently to a Zn deficiency. Zn deficiency causes many metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic encephalopathy. Conversely, metabolic disorders such as hypoalbuminemia often lead to Zn deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis. Recent studies have revealed the putative mechanisms by which Zn deficiency produces a variety of metabolic abnormalities in chronic liver disease. Zn supplementation has shown positive effects on such metabolic abnormalities in experimental models and in actual patients with chronic liver disease. This review article summarizes the pathogenesis of metabolic abnormalities due to Zn deficiency and the beneficial effects of Zn administration in patients with chronic liver disease. In addition, we also shed light on the interactions between Zn and other trace elements, vitamins, amino acids or hormones in such patients. Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

WD is caused by mutations in ATP7B, which encodes a transmembrane copper-transporting ATPase, resulting in impaired copper homeostasis and copper overload in the liver, brain, and other organs. The clinical course of WM can vary in type and severity of symptoms, but progressive liver disease is a common feature. Patients may also present with neurological disorders and psychiatric symptoms. WD is diagnosed using diagnostic algorithms that include clinical symptoms and signs, measurements of copper metabolism, and DNA analysis of ATP7B. Available treatments include chelation therapy and zinc salts, which reverse copper overload through a variety of mechanisms. In addition, liver transplantation is indicated in selected cases. New active ingredients such as tetrathiomolybdate salts are currently being investigated in clinical studies and gene therapies are being tested in animal models.

Surgical splenectomy is a common treatment for this condition; however, emotional and neurological deterioration can occur after splenectomy. In recent years, partial splenic embolization (PSE) has increasingly been performed as a non-surgical alternative for the treatment of hypersplenism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PSE compared to splenectomy in the treatment of hypersplenism in WM patients. METHODS: Fifty WM patients with hypersplenism were randomized into two groups (group A and group B) of 25 patients each. Patients in groups A and B were treated with PSE and splenectomy, respectively. Data were collected on the clinical efficacy of each procedure, adverse events, hematology and blood chemistry test results, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) findings (Group A only). Results: Significant improvements in platelet and leukocyte counts after PSE and splenectomy were observed in all patients. PSE was associated with improved liver function without serious complications, and no significant changes in emotional and neurological symptoms were observed. In contrast, seven WD patients experienced neurological deterioration after splenectomy. Conclusions: Hypersplenism in WM patients has been successfully treated with PSE, which appears to be a safe and effective alternative treatment for WM-induced hypersplenism.

3345,"Clinical features, laboratory findings and prognosis in fulminant Wilson's disease","INTRODUCTION: We evaluated 16 years of experience in pediatric patients with fulminant Wilson's disease (WD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 98 pediatric patients with fulminant hepatic failure, we reviewed the clinical and laboratory data of 12 (12.2%) with fulminant WM. PELD-MELD, Child-Pugh scores and new Wilson indices at the time of application were calculated. The forecasts were also recorded. Results: There were a total of 12 patients with fulminant MM, 9 were female (75%). The mean age at the time of arrival was 9.3 +/- 1.59 years (range: 7.3-12.5 years). 4 patients had no findings of encephalopathy, while 2 patients had stage 1 encephalopathy, 3 had stage 2 encephalopathy, and 3 had stage 3 encephalopathy at the time of admission. 6 patients had ascites. Mean hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet counts were 7.43 +/- 2.67 g/dL, 20,330 +/- 12,430/mm3, and 131,820 +/- 93,650/mm3, respectively. The liver function tests at the reference point were: total bilirubin: 39.26 +/- 15.66 mg/dL, direct bilirubin: 27 +/- 11.76 mg/dL, AST: 513.66 +/- 943.6 U/L, ALT: 164.6 +/- 331.8 U/L, GGT: 78.4+/-71.8 U/L, ALP: 234+/-250.6 U/L, Albumin 2.8+/- 0.73 g/dl, prothrombin time 36.44+/-16.29 s, INR 4+/-2.25. Mean creatinine was 0.83 +/- 0.24 mg/dL, mean glomerular filtration rate was 77.66 +/- 64.84 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 5 patients had tubulopathy during follow-up. 9 patients had low seruloplasmin levels. Seruloplasmin levels varied between 5.9-26 mg/dl (mean 13.8+/-7.4 mg/dl). 24-hour urine copper was measured in 4 patients and the mean value was 430+/-600 mg/dL. The provocation test was performed on another 4 patients and the mean urinary copper value was 3155 +/- 2490 mg/dL. Mean PELD scores, Child-Pugh scores, and new Wilson indices were 32.1 +/- 11.5 (range: 16-48), 11.44 +/- 1.66 (range: 10-15), and 15.44 +/- 1.94 (range: 12-18), respectively. There was only 1 patient over 11 years of age with a MELD score of 40. Plasmapheresis was used in all patients, while D-penicillamine was also used in 3 patients was administered D-penicillamine, zinc and steroids at 2; Trientine, zinc and steroids in 2 patients. 4 patients died, 6 underwent liver transplantation and 2 survived spontaneously. Histopathological examinations of explanted livers or postmortem liver necropsies were evaluated in 9 patients. 7 patients had cirrhosis, 1 had chronic active hepatitis, and 1 had diffuse microvesicular steatosis. The mean copper content in the tissue was 440 +/- 347 µg/g dry liver tissue. 5 patients who underwent liver transplantation had living related donors and 1 patient had a deceased donor. They were followed up for 9+/-3.3 years (range: 4.5-12 years) after transplantation. Conclusion: Fulminant WD is extremely fatal if liver transplantation cannot be performed. The introduction of plasmapheresis and chelation therapy can be life-saving in low-risk patients. Most patients present with findings of cirrhosis upon arrival at liver histopathology.",,"Ozcay, F.;Baris, Z.;Sezer, O. B.;Haberal, M.",2018,July,,0,0,
3346,Wilson's disease: a case report. [Portuguese],"Objectives: This report describes a rare genetic disorder called Wilson's disease, which is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and the symptoms of which can be easily confused with other diseases. The underlying cause of the clinical manifestations is the accumulation of copper in various compartments of the human body, particularly in locations such as the liver, brain, kidneys, and cornea, due to mutations in the ATP7B gene, which encodes Cu+2 ATPase, a copper carrier protein located in the Golgi complex of hepatocytes. Liver changes can manifest as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and more rarely as fulminant hepatitis. Neurological changes are variable, predominantly extrapyramidal symptoms, tremors, dystonia, dysarthria, mood swings and psychiatric symptoms, untreated progressive decline in intellectual capacity. One of the most extraordinary features of this syndrome is the great variability in phenotypic manifestations in patients with the same mutation. Several biochemical parameters are analyzed in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease: serum ceruloplasmin, serum copper, urinary excretion of copper and hepatic copper concentration. In addition, an ophthalmological examination with Kayser-Fleischer ring observation is carried out. Genetic testing can be done to complement and facilitate diagnosis, since the symptoms and laboratory abnormalities can often be associated with other diseases. The treatment is based on the use of copper chelating agents. D-penicillamine is the drug of choice, despite the risk of neurological deterioration in up to 50% of patients and the various side effects associated with its use. Trientine and tetrathiomolybdate are alternative medications, with the latter being chosen for those with neurological symptoms. Zinc is indicated for asymptomatic or maintenance therapy. Early treatment prevents serious complications. Case Report: A 14-year-old patient with Poco Fundo-MG consulted a physician for frequent facial paralysis, particularly in the mandibular region, resulting in dysphagia and dysphonia, as well as irritability and gait disturbances. She underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which showed ""symmetric signal changes in the bilateral striatum with evidence of caudate and caudate edema and atrophy of the pale eyeballs."" In view of the family history of Wilson's syndrome, a differential diagnosis was made by performing the serum concentration of ceruloplasmin and serum and urine copper, which showed typical changes of Wilson's syndrome, and ocular biomicroscopy, which confirmed the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring . The patient had no previous liver disease, demonstrating that the disease does not always present as expected and reflecting the difficulty in making an early diagnosis that can prevent the onset of the first symptoms. All patients with Wilson syndrome require multidisciplinary treatment as it is a disease that can significantly affect various organs and systems.

3347,Challenges in diagnosing Wilson's disease in a resource-constrained country,"Background: Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, with reduced excretion of copper in the bile, resulting in copper accumulation in the liver, brain, kidneys and eyes . The signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease, such as B. Hepatic dysfunction, musculoskeletal manifestations and neuropsychiatric features may be difficult to distinguish from other disorders. Aim: To describe the challenges of the first diagnosed Wilson's disease at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Case: A 13-year-old boy, born to a non-consanguineous marriage, was born one year ago with anemia. He was suspected with thalassemia and then leukemia, but further diagnostic procedures showed negative results. He had a history of melena due to grade 3 esophageal varices and underwent variceal ligation. Six months later, he was referred to the Clinic for Nutrition and Metabolic Diseases with suspected hereditary metabolic diseases due to involuntary movements of the limbs and dysarthria. On physical examination, the patient was severely malnourished with skin pigmentation, Kayser-Fleischer rings in both eyes, and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory findings showed anemia, thrombocytopenia and mildly elevated hepatic transaminases, normal serum electrolytes, plasma glucose and renal function. Brain MRI T2-weighted images showed high signal hyperintensities in bilateral basal ganglia. Wilson's disease was one of our differential diagnoses, so we did blood and urine tests abroad. Results showed low serum ceruloplasmin and increased urine copper. Based on the above investigations we diagnosed Wilson's disease and he was then treated with D-penicillamine, zinc and diazepam. Conclusion: A suspicion is required to diagnose Wilson's disease, especially in a child with liver disease and neurological manifestations. Due to the lack of awareness and limited diagnostic methods in our country, it is still difficult to diagnose Wilson's disease.",,"Pratita, W.;Rachmawati, N.;Sjarif, D.

3348,Clinically diagnosed late-onset fulminant Wilson's disease without cirrhosis: a case report,"64-year-old woman was admitted to our clinic with bulbar conjunctival jaundice and general fatigue. Upon admission, she developed hepatic encephalopathy and was diagnosed with fulminant hepatitis based on the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) position paper. Thereafter, additional laboratory findings revealed that the serum ceruloplasmin level was reduced, the urinary copper level was greatly increased, and routine tests specific to Wilson's disease (WD) were positive, but the Kayser-Fleischer ring was inconclusive. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with fulminant WM based on the AASLD practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of WM. Then the administration of penicillamine and zinc acetate was started; Unfortunately, the patient died of acute pneumonia on the 28th day of his hospital stay. At autopsy, the liver showed no bridging pattern of fibrosis indicative of chronic liver damage. Here we present the case of a patient with clinically diagnosed late-onset fulminant WM without cirrhosis who had positive disease-specific routine tests. Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

3349,Tiermodelle der Wilson-Krankheit,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that manifests with hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms. The limitations of currently available therapy for WD (particularly when treating neuropsychiatric disorders) together with our limited understanding of key aspects of this disease (e.g., neurological vs. hepatic presentation) justify the continuing need to study WD in appropriate animal models. Four animal models of WD were established: the Long Evans cinnamon rat, the poison milk mouse, the ATP7b knockout mouse, and the Labrador retriever. The existing models of WD all show good resemblance to human hepatic WD and have been helpful in developing a better understanding of human disease. As mammals, the mouse, rat, and canine models also benefit from high homology to the human genome. However, important differences exist between these mammalian models and human diseases, most notably the lack of a convincing neurological phenotype. This review first provides an overview of our current knowledge of the orthologous genes encoding ATP7B and the closely related ATP7A protein in C. elegans, Drosophila, and zebrafish (Danio rerio), and then summarizes key features from rodent and larger mammalian models associated with ATP7B deficiency.

3350,High genetic carrier frequency of Wilson's disease in France: discrepancies with clinical prevalence,"Background: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by ATP7B gene mutations that result in excessive levels of copper, particularly in the liver and brain. The WD phenotype varies in its clinical presentation and intensity. Diagnosis of this metabolic disorder is important because lifelong treatment based on the use of copper chelators or zinc salts is more effective when started early. The global prevalence of WD varies, with an average of 1/30,000. In France, a recent study based on French health insurance data estimated the clinical prevalence of the disease at around 3/200,000. Methods: To estimate the genetic prevalence of WD in France, we analyzed the ATP7B gene by next-generation sequencing from a large French cohort of random subjects. Results: We observed a high heterozygous carrier frequency of ATP7B in France. Among the 697 subjects examined, 22 subjects (22 alleles/1394 alleles) had 18 variants classified as pathogenic or probably pathogenic at the heterozygous level, resulting in a prevalence of 0.032 or 1/31 subjects. Conclusions: This significant and inexplicable discrepancy between the frequency of heterozygous carriers and the clinical prevalence of WD can be explained by clinical variability, incomplete penetrance, and the presence of modifying genes. It suggests that molecular analysis of ATP7B should be interpreted with caution, always in conjunction with copper assays (ceruloplasmin, relatively exchangeable copper, 24-hour urinary copper excretion), particularly with regard to exome sequencing.

3352,A follow-up study of symptomatic pediatric Wilson's disease from a non-transplant tertiary center,"Background and Aims: There are few data on the outcome of hepatic and neurological Wilson disease in children. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 90 patients with symptomatic Wilson's disease (according to Ferenci's criteria) was performed. Hepatic outcome was classified as resolution (R = normal LFT & asymptomatic), partial resolution (P = near normal LFT & asymptomatic), worsening or worsening (W/D), and need for transplantation (OLT). Results: Hepatic (H) 75.5%, neurological (N) 16.6%, and combined hepatic and neurological (H+N) 7.7% disease were diagnosed at a mean age of 9.5 years at H and 10.9 years observed at N&H&N. The mean duration of symptoms was 5.2 months for H & H+N and 8.76 months for N. 14.4% had a history of consanguinity. 38.8% had a family history. Hepatic manifestations were: acute hepatitis - 16%; acute liver failure - 6.6%; acute in chronic liver failure - 26.6%; compensated chronic liver disease (C CLD) – 5.3%; decompensated cirrhosis (D CLD) – 45%. 38.8% had varices and 75% of H and 90.9% of H+N & N had KF rings. Mean ceruloplasmin was 9.89 mg% in H and 6.6 mg% in H+N & N. Mean 24-hour baseline urine copper was 275 mcg/24 hr in H and 253 mcg/24 hr in H+N & N. Mean hepatic dry copper was 276 mcg/g. 46.1% had histological evidence of cirrhosis. Patients were treated with D-penicillamine (D), zinc (Z), or a combination of both (D+Z). The mean follow-up time was 86.6 months in 80 (89%) patients. Results of hepatic WD (H=68+H&N=7) are indicated (Fig. 1). R was reached in a mean of 21.8 months. Of patients with N (15), 2 (1 noncompliant) patients had worsening neurological status. Conclusions: The hepatic presentation of WD is the most common in children.

METHODS: The study was conducted at the Department of Medical Gastroenterology, Govt. Stanley Medical College Chennai, October 2017, May 2018. 16 patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease were enrolled in the study. Diagnosis of Wilson's disease based on modified Leipzig score using serum ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urine copper, KF ring, neurological features, liver biopsy, etc. Patients were analyzed based on their clinical features at the time of presentation. Results: The majority of patients were in the age group 15-30 years (56%). 9 patients were male and 7 female. The majority of patients with liver manifestations (68.7%) - jaundice was found in 63% of patients and 50% of patients had ascites. 25% of patients had neuropsychiatric manifestations and 13% of patients had both hepatic and neurological features. KF ring present in 56% of patients and all patients with neurological features had a KF ring. 3 patients were asymptomatic and were diagnosed at family screening. 56% of the patients were born of a blood relationship. Conclusions: Consanguinity plays an important role in the high incidence of disease in the affected family. Family screening is important for early detection. Liver manifestations were found more frequently. Penicillamine and zinc therapy can effectively treat Wilson disease with hepatic symptoms. Liver transplantation remains life-saving for patients with fulminant and end-stage disease.",,"Joseph, J.;Vinay, C.;Ms, R.",2018,July,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2018.06.509,0,0,
3354,A case of Wilson's disease presenting as acute pancreatitis,"Background: Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism with hepatic or neurological presentation. Wilson's disease, which presents as pancreatitis, has only been previously described in two case reports and has been attributed to either copper deposition in the pancreas or gallstone formation. Here we report a case of Wilson's disease in a young adult presenting as acute pancreatitis associated with gallstones. CASE SUMMARY: A 17-year-old woman presented with upper abdominal pain, 2-day jaundice, and 1-day non-beak-like vomiting. She has not had similar episodes in the past. The patient had no significant dependencies and no contributing family or perinatal history. She had normal school skills. Clinical examination revealed the presence of jaundice, pallor, and mild upper abdominal tenderness. The examinations revealed haemolytic anemia, a disturbed liver function test in the form of mild hyperbilirubenemia and transaminitis. Pancreatic enzymes were significantly increased (amylase 816U/L/lipase 906U/L). Imaging showed features of acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis, calculous cholecystitis, coarse hepatic parenchyma with splenomegaly, and mild ascites. She was treated conservatively for biliary pancreatitis and has shown good improvement. At the same time, an examination for chronic liver disease was performed, which revealed a low serum ceruloplasmin level (0.05 g/l), an increased 24-hour urine copper level (1123.8 mcg/day) and a positive KF ring . After being diagnosed with Wilson's disease, she began d-penicillamine and zinc therapy. At follow-up, her biochemical parameters improved, with 24-hour urine copper gradually decreasing to 168 mcg/day. The patient is currently completely asymptomatic and has had no recurrence of pancreatitis. Conclusions: This case highlights an unusual presentation of Wilson's disease as biliary pancreatitis. Therefore, it brings the study of liver disease, particularly Wilson's disease, into focus in young people with jaundice and pancreatitis.",,"Tarkeshwari, R.

3355,"Stroke in a Young Patient with Wilson's Disease: The Specter of ""Imbalanced Hemostasis""","Background: Coagulopathy is an integral part of hepatocellular failure and reflects the central role of liver function in hemostasis. Case Summary: We present a seven-year-old boy, a known case of Wilson's disease, presenting with jaundice and abdominal distension for two weeks and a history of repeated episodes of hypoglycemia in the past five days. He was taking penicillamine 500 mg three times a day. On examination it was found that he had chronic liver disease, decompensated with grade I hepatic encephalopathy and minimal ascites. Laboratory tests showed thrombocytopenia (64,000/mm3), blood glucose of 52 mg/dl, serum albumin; 2.5 mg/dl, bilirubin; 17 mg/dl, serum alanine transaminase; 52IU/L, aspartic transaminase; 153 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase; 211 IU/L and an internationally standardized ratio of 3.1. The patient was listed as a priority for liver transplantation with a PELD score of 32 and a Na-MELD of 30, with the donor being his mother. However, within 7 days of listing, the patient developed a sudden onset of a decerebrated posture. CT scan of head showed acute frontal lobe venous infarction with midline displacement. His condition deteriorated rapidly and he died the next day, probably of a brain fracture, despite intensive care. Conclusions: The above case demonstrates the dynamic state of ""rebalanced hemostasis"" in a cirrhotic patient with significant coagulation disorders. The risk of cerebrovascular events, particularly infarction in cirrhosis, has not been clearly established. The restored balance of hemostasis achieved through the simultaneous reduction of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors could explain the arterial and venous thrombotic events and challenge the old dogma/paradox of increased bleeding in cirrhotic patients.",,"Javid, K.;Cg, S.;Khan, J.;Ts, R.

3356,Wilson's Disease Update: Focus on WTX-101,"Wilson disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism. Treatment is lifelong with the goal of restoring copper homeostasis. Current treatments are limited by multiple daily dosing and side effects, and a rare but serious risk of neurological deterioration when initiating chelation therapy. Excess free copper is thought to be responsible for copper toxicity and early neurological deterioration. Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (WTX-101) is currently one of the emerging novel therapies that appears to fill an unmet need by offering an option for once-daily dosing and the absence of significant adverse effects. It also appears to have a low risk of causing early neurological deterioration. WTX-101 reduces free copper levels by forming a tight complex with copper.

3357,Mowat-Wilson syndrome with febrile seizures,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a disorder caused by mutations or deletions of the zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox-2 (ZEB2) gene. Diagnosing MWS can be challenging for neurologists because its manifestations are diverse and the spectrum of genetic mutations is wide. Here we describe two patients with MWS who initially presented with atypical forms of febrile seizures as children. Both had distinctive facial features, cognitive impairment, and urogenital abnormalities consistent with MWS. Using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) using an epilepsy gene panel, we were able to detect a nonsense mutation (c.1965C>A) in the ZEB2 gene in one patient and a frameshift mutation (c.2348dupC ) identify other patient. Fever-induced seizures can be signs of MWS. MWS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile seizures, particularly when the patient has distinctive facial features and multiple abnormalities, including cardiac, urogenital, and ocular defects.

3358,WTX101-A Novel Copper Protein Binding Agent for Wilson's Disease Shows Long-Term Neurological Improvement in an Ongoing Extension of a Phase 2 Trial (WTX101-201),"Background and Objectives: WTX101 (bischolintetrathiomolybdate) is a premier copper protein binding agent that reduces plasma non-ceruloplasmin bound copper (NCC) by forming tripartite complexes with albumin and increases biliary copper excretion. Here we present preliminary 72-week data from the ongoing extension of a phase 2 study in patients with Wilson's disease (WD). METHODS: All 22 patients who completed the 24-week open-label, single-arm study elected to continue once-daily treatment with WTX101 in extension. Assessments up to 72 weeks included disability and neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), copper control, liver status, and safety. Results: At study entry, 86% of patients had varying degrees of WM-related neurological symptoms. From baseline to week 72, mean (SD) UWDRS disability score improved from 6.6 (10.0) to 1.2 (2.1) and neurological score improved from 22.8 (21.0) to 9.9 (10.7). The neurological UWDRS score improved by >=4 points in 12 patients, stabilized (+/-3 points) in 5 patients and worsened by >=4 points in 2 patients. The mean (SD) NCC level corrected for copper in tripartite complexes was 3.6 (2.1) mM at baseline and decreased to 0.5 (0.7) mM at week 72 unchanged at week 72. Two interruptions were considered unrelated to treatment with WTX101. Conclusion: Once-daily treatment with WTX101 improved neurological status and disability and controlled free copper in patients with WM over 72 weeks. WTX101 was generally well tolerated and together with its simplified dosing, WTX101 has the potential to fill unmet needs in WD.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Schilsky, M.;Askari, F.;Ferenci, P.;Bronstein, J.;Bega, D.;Ala, A.;Nicholl, D.;Weiss, K.

3359,Metallothionein is increased in the liver and duodenum of Ap7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice,"Various mutations in the copper transporter gene Atp7b have been identified as the primary cause of Wilson's disease. These changes lead to high copper concentrations, especially in the liver and brain, and thus to a dysfunction of these organs. The Atp7<sup>(-/-)</sup> mouse is an established animal model of Wilson's disease and is characterized by abnormal copper accumulation, low serum oxidase activity, and increased urinary copper excretion. Metallothionein (MT) proteins are low molecular weight metal-binding proteins and are essential for zinc homeostasis, but also play a role in the regulation of other metals such as copper. However, the molecular mechanisms of MT in relation to Atp7b remain elusive. In this study we investigate the expression of MT in the liver and duodenum of Ap7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice and wild-type mice. Hepatic and duodenal expression of MT was measured in real time by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and post-translational expression was analyzed by immunoblot and immunofluorescence. The expression of MT in liver and duodenum was significantly higher in Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice than in controls. The hepatic and duodenal copper, iron and zinc content was also examined. Compared to controls, hepatic copper and iron levels were significantly higher in Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice, while hepatic zinc levels were significantly lower. In the duodenum, the copper and zinc content of Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice was significantly lower than that of controls. The iron content in the duodenum was also lower in Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice, but did not reach statistical significance. The results of our study suggest that metallothionein is elevated in the liver and duodenum of Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice. Copyright © 2018, the author(s).",,"Zhang, C.

3360,Wilson's disease and related copper diseases,"Copper is a required cofactor for enzymes in critical metabolic pathways. Mutations in genes for copper metabolism or abnormalities in copper metabolism result in copper excess or deficiency disease. Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase. Over 500 different WD mutations throughout the ATP7B gene have been described, most of which are missense mutations. Mutations in both ATP7B alleles result in abnormal copper metabolism and subsequent toxic accumulation of copper. The clinical manifestations of neurological WM include variable combinations of dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, and choreoathetosis. Misdiagnosis and delays in treatment are clinically relevant since untreated WM leads to liver failure or severe neurological disability and death. Treatment can prevent and cure WD. Mutations in a second, closely related copper-transporting ATPase, ATP7A, cause a spectrum of copper deficiency disorders including Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome, and ATP7A-associated distal motor neuropathy. Two important non-genetic causes of copper-deficiency myeloneuropathy are copper deficiency after gastric bypass or due to excessive zinc intake, both of which can cause myeloneuropathy similar to vitamin B12 deficiency. Copper deficiency after gastric bypass is preventable, and identifying and eliminating the excess source of zinc, most commonly toothpaste, can lead to recovery.

Complaints of dyskinesia, slurred speech, severe hyperbilirubinemia, and prominent extrapyramidal features consisting of stiffness, tremor, and ophthalmological examination of her eyes revealed Kayser-Fleischer ring and sunflower cataract and low blood count. Conclusion: Wilson's disease is a rare inherited disease. About 30% of patients cannot tolerate penicillamine due to early hypersensitivity or develop bone marrow suppression or renal failure due to treatment failure. Therefore, zinc is considered an alternative therapy for pediatric patients. Copyright © 2018 EManuscript Technologies. All rights reserved.",,"Karthickeyan, K.;Reddy, C. M.;Mohamed, J. B.

3362,CCDC115-CDG: A new rare and misleading inherited disease,"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) associated with defects in Golgi apparatus homeostasis account for an increasing proportion of these rare inherited disorders. Among them, COG-CDG, ATP6V0A2-CDG, TMEM199-CDG, and CCDC115-CDG have been shown to disrupt Golgi vesicular transport and/or luminal pH acidification. Here we report 3 new independent cases of CCDC115-CDG focusing on diagnostic difficulties related to strong phenotypic similarities with mitochondriopathies, Niemann-Pick disease C and Wilson disease. While two individuals presented clinically with early and severe liver fibrosis and cirrhosis associated with neurological symptoms, the other presented “only” isolated and late severe liver involvement. The biological findings were similar to those in previously described patients, including hypercholesterolemia, elevated alkaline phosphatases, and defects in copper metabolism. CDG screening and glycosylation study finally led to the molecular diagnosis of CCDC115-CDG. In addition to pointing out the importance of CDG screening in patients with unexplained and severe liver disease, these reports expand on the clinical and molecular phenotypes of CCDC115-CDG. Hepatic involvement is specifically addressed. In addition, hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of liver disease and major biological abnormalities are proposed.

3363,Cerebral metal accumulation and neurodegenerative diseases - causal relationship?,"Metal ions are essential to life as cofactors of various metalloproteins, but are toxic in excess. Based on their occurrence in the human body, biogenic metals can be divided into major (e.g. calcium, magnesium), trace (e.g. iron, zinc) and ultratrace elements (e.g. manganese, copper, cobalt, molybdenum). will. Several other metals such as mercury or lead can enter the brain and cause neurotoxicity. Mutations in proteins involved in metal homeostasis cause systemic metal accumulation disorders with a 5-fold or greater increase in tissue metal concentration. These genetic disorders can be considered as model diseases for metal neurotoxicity. Mutation in the ATP7B copper transporter causes Wilson disease, mutations in SLC30A10 and SLC39A14 cause manganese transporter deficiency, and mutations in genes encoding ceruloplasmin and ferritin result in neurodegeneration with accumulation of brain iron. Exposure to metals in the environment can also result in a marked neuropathology with severe clinical phenotype, as seen for mercury in Minamata Bay, Japan, in the 1930s-1960s and for manganese during the epidemic of intravenous methcatinone abuse in Eastern Europe was documented in the years 1990-2010. Disorders of cerebral metal homeostasis, namely iron, copper and manganese, have also been found in common sporadic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Dysregulated transition metals in the brain may contribute to neurodegeneration by mediating oxidative stress, altering enzymatic functions, inducing protein aggregation, and triggering neuronal death. The outstanding questions for research in the metal biology of neurodegeneration are 1) whether low levels of environmental metal exposure can induce neurotoxicity and 2) whether correction of disrupted metal homeostasis, e.g. B. by chelation, could have a neuroprotective effect.",,"Dusek, P.",2018,July,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.12449,0,0,
3364,Morbus Wilson: The eponymous eminence of careful knowledge!,"Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) is a rare autosomal disease with an identified genetic abnormality on chromosome arm 13q and a resulting defect in the hepatic copper-transporting ATPase gene (ATP7B) [1]. The core abnormality is a dysfunction of copper metabolism with abnormal biliary excretion of copper and the consequent accumulation of this toxic chemical in classically identified structures (i.e. cornea, liver, brain, others) [1], [2]. Various confusing presentations are seen, making accurate diagnosis difficult; classically there is the triad of liver disease, neuropsychiatric presentations and Kayser-Fleischer rings in the cornea [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Kayser-Fleischer rings are copper deposits in the cornea where an ophthalmological examination reveals a golden discoloration of Descemet's membrane at the limbic regions. The hepatic presentation can resemble that of chronic active hepatitis including cirrhosis [2]. Neuropsychiatric presentations may include symptoms suggestive of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or Parkinson's disease involving the basal ganglia. In addition, there may be incoordination, ""wing flapping"" of the arms, dystonia and/or dystonic posture. Dysarthria is noted in most cases and dysphagia can also occur. Clinical confusion is noted with the encephalopathy observed in this condition, whether due to liver failure or copper toxicity itself [5]. Diagnosis includes blood tests (including low serum ceruloplasmin) and urine (including elevated urinary copper levels) along with liver biopsy (showing elevated copper deposits) and genetic testing [2], [6]. It is a fatal disease without treatment that involves early diagnosis, the patient's diet low in copper (avoiding copper utensils for cooking), and the use of copper chelates with D-penicillamine or trientine and zinc supplements [1], [2], [3] , [4], [5], [6].

3365,Long-term evaluation of urinary copper excretion and copper not associated with ceruloplasmin in patients with Wilson's disease on medical treatment,"Objective: In patients with Wilson's disease, urinary copper excretion rates and copper concentrations not associated with ceruloplasmin are increased. However, there is little literature describing the monitoring of these parameters over a longer period of time. Methods: This is a single-center retrospective study with data collected between 2003 and 2015 from 321 patients with Wilson's disease by chart review. The patients were under therapy with D-penicillamine, trientine or zinc. 24-hour urinary copper excretion rates, copper not associated with ceruloplasmin, and total serum copper concentrations were determined at baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and >= 60 months after the start of therapy. In patients taking chelating agents, all parameters were measured during continued therapy and after a 48-hour dose-free period. A mathematical formula to predict 24-hour urinary copper excretion rates under different therapies was established. Results: In all treatment groups, urinary copper excretion rates decreased over time, but inter-individual variation in results was high. Copper concentrations not associated with ceruloplasmin tended to decrease over time, but with greater variation in results than urinary copper excretion rates. Conclusion: Due to their variability, urinary copper excretion rates and serum copper concentrations are not ideal parameters to monitor the benefit of copper-reducing therapy. Urinary copper excretion rates appear to be more appropriate for this purpose than copper concentrations not associated with ceruloplasmin. Copyright © 2018 SSIEM",,"Pfeiffenberger, J.;Lohse, C.

3366,Wilson's disease and lupus nephritis: coincidence or genuine association?,"12-year-old girl, born to consanguineous parents, presented with 8 months of recurrent episodes of hematuria associated with periorbital and lower extremity edema for 20 days. At presentation there was no jaundice, hepatomegaly, or neurological abnormalities. An older brother had died of jaundice when he was 10 years old. Urinalysis showed multiple dysmorphic erythrocytes without proteinuria and there were leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia (23 g/l). The C3 component of complementemia was low and anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies were strongly positive by immunofluorescence. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was considered, but the severe hypoalbuminemia was unexplained. During the processing of the prerenal biopsy, a disturbed coagulation profile with elevated transaminases led to an examination for chronic liver disease, which culminated in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Treatment with penicillamine and immunosuppressants was initiated, but neurological deterioration occurred on day 30 of admission and she died on day 41 of worsening liver failure. Postmortem liver biopsy showed cirrhosis and postmortem kidney biopsy showed features of class II lupus nephritis. Autoimmune antibodies and autoimmune disorders have been reported in Wilson's disease, and there are anecdotal reports of an association of SLE with Wilson's disease. However, this case is unique in that lupus nephritis was the first manifestation before Wilson's disease was diagnosed. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of this association require further research.

3367,Metabolic disposition of WTX101 (bischolintetrathiomolybdate) in a rat model of Wilson's disease,"1. WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a copper (Cu) protein-binding agent developed for the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD), a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B Cu transporter and leads to toxic Cu accumulation. 2. The mass balance of a single intravenous dose of WTX101, measured as molybdenum (Mo), was assessed over 168 hours in control (Long Evans Agouti [LEA]) and Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, a WD model. 3. In LEC rats, Mo was partially excreted (up to 45%); 29% by renal clearance and fecal clearance still ongoing at 168 h accounted for 16%. In contrast, Mo was almost completely excreted in LEA rats (~87%); 79% was excreted renally, only 7% fecal excretion. 4. In LEC rats, the ratio of faecal to renal Mo excretion was increased (4:6) compared to controls (1:9). 5. Significantly more Mo was found in LEC liver and kidney compared to LEA tissues, consistent with the Cu distribution in the tissue. 6. These results are consistent with the mechanism of action of WTX101: in the WD model, excess Cu is removed from hepatic metallothionein and retained in the stable three-part tetrathiomolybdate-Cu-albumin complex, preventing degradation of tetrathiomolybdate and resulting in reduced urinary excretion and more fecal matter leads to excretion than controls.

3369,WTX101 - an investigational drug for the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder in which excess toxic copper accumulates in the liver, brain, and other tissues, resulting in severe and life-threatening symptoms. Copper overload can be assessed as non-ceruloplasmin bound copper and non-ceruloplasmin bound copper (NCC) in the blood. Current therapies are limited by efficacy, safety concerns, and multi-day dosing. Areas Covered: This article reviews the literature on WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate), a first-in-class oral copper protein-binding agent under development for the treatment of WD. Expert Opinion: In a phase II proof-of-concept study, once-daily dosing of WTX101 for 24 weeks rapidly lowered NCC levels, and this was accompanied by improved neurological status with no apparent initial drug-induced paradoxical deterioration, reduced disability, more stable liver function, with a favorable safety profile. WTX101 directly removes excess copper from intracellular hepatic copper stores and also forms an inert tripartite complex with circulating copper and albumin and promotes biliary copper excretion. These mechanisms may explain the rapid biochemical and clinical improvements observed. A Phase III trial of WTX101 is ongoing and results are eagerly awaited to confirm if WTX101 can improve the treatment of this devastating disease.

3370,Zinc monotherapy for young children with presymptomatic Wilson's disease: A multicenter study in Japan,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Few studies of zinc monotherapy in presymptomatic Wilson's disease have focused on young children. We therefore evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for such children and established benchmarks for maintenance therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively and prospectively studied children younger than 10 years of age with presymptomatic Wilson's disease who received zinc monotherapy from the time of diagnosis at 12 participating pediatric centers in Japan. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients met the inclusion criteria. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase decreased significantly from 1 month after starting treatment and generally remained below 50 U/L from 1 to 8 years of treatment. 24-hour urinary copper decreased significantly at 6 months and usually remained below 75 cups/day and between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the remainder of the study. All patients continued to take zinc and none became symptomatic. In patients less than 6 years of age who received 50 mg/day zinc as an initial dose, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase decreased significantly 1 month after the start of treatment, as did gamma-glutamyltransferase and urinary 24-hour copper after 6 months. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter study of zinc monotherapy in young children with presymptomatic Wilson's disease. Such monotherapy proved to be highly effective and safe. Maintaining normal transaminase levels (or below 50 U/L if normalization is difficult) and a 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 µg/kg/day and below 75 µg/day is a reasonable goal. A starting dose of 50 mg/day is suitable for patients under 6 years of age.

3371,Copper dyshomeostasis in Wilson's disease and Alzheimer's disease as shown by serum and urine copper indicators,"Abnormal exposure to copper is the cause of Wilson's disease (WD), a rare condition characterized by elevated plasma levels of copper that are not bound to ceruloplasmin (nCp-Cu, also known as ""free"" copper). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), meta-analysis shows that copper decreases in the brain but increases in serum due to the increase in the nCp-Cu component. Despite the similarities, a direct comparison of the biological status of copper in the two diseases has never been made. To fill this gap, we evaluated serum copper, ceruloplasmin, nCp-Cu and Cu:Cp in 385 CE and 336 healthy controls previously screened and compared them to 9 newly diagnosed WM patients. We then examined the 24-hour urinary copper excretion in 24 WD patients receiving D-penicillamine (D-Pen) treatment and in 35 healthy controls and compared the results to those in AD patients participating in a previously published study phase II D-Pen clinical study. After adjustment for sex and age, serum nCp-Cu and Cu:Cp were higher in AD and WD than in healthy controls (both p<0.001). While nCp-Cu was similar between AD and WD, Cu:Cp was higher in WD (p<0.016). 24-hour urinary copper excretion was higher in AD patients (12.05 µg/day) than in healthy controls (4.82 µg/day; p<0.001). 77.8% of AD patients on D-Pen treatment had a 24-hour urinary output greater than 200 cups/day, indicating copper control failure. This study provides new insight into the pathophysiology of copper homeostasis in AD, demonstrating failure of copper control and the Cu:Cp ratio as a useful marker.

3372,Recent Advances in Understanding Liver Fibrosis: Bridging Basic Research and Individualized Treatment Policies [Version 1; Referee: 2 admitted],"Liver fibrosis is characterized by the formation and deposition of excess fibrous connective tissue, resulting in progressive remodeling of architectural tissue. Regardless of the underlying noxious trigger, tissue damage induces an inflammatory response involving the local vasculature and immune system and systemic mobilization of endocrine and neurological mediators, ultimately leading to activation of matrix-producing cell populations. Genetic disorders, chronic viral infections, alcohol abuse, autoimmune attacks, metabolic disorders, cholestasis, changes in bile acid composition or concentration, venous obstruction, and parasitic infections are known factors that predispose to liver fibrosis. In addition, excess fat and other lipotoxic mediators that produce endoplasmic reticulum stress, alteration in mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and alterations in the microbiota are implicated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and subsequently in the initiation and progression of hepatic fibrosis. Multidisciplinary expert panels have developed practice guidelines, including recommendations for preferred therapeutic approaches for a particular cause of liver disease, stage of fibrosis, or emerging comorbidities associated with persistent loss of liver function. Here we summarize the factors leading to liver fibrosis and the current concepts in antifibrotic therapies.

Aim: To study the efficacy of penicillamine followed by zinc in the treatment of symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed case records of 31 symptomatic hepatic WM patients for disease severity scores (Child's, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), Nazer's, and New Wilson Index (NWI) score) and 24-hour urinary Coppers were compared at 3 time points - baseline at presentation, at transition from penicillamine to zinc, and at the end of follow-up. Results: Thirty-one patients (mean age 11 [5-24] years) with symptomatic hepatic WM were studied; ten had associated neuropsychiatric manifestations of WD. Penicillamine was switched to zinc sulfate either for financial reasons (28 patients) or because of penicillamine side effects (3 patients). At presentation (baseline), six patients were Child-A, five were Child-B, and 17 were Child-C. 728) weeks. There was a significant improvement in liver function tests and disease severity scores (Child, MELD, Nazer, and NWI score) in the transition from penicillamine to zinc compared to baseline. This improvement persisted through the end of the study period with a 90% survival rate at 10 (2-20) years. Fifteen of the 17 patients with Child C cirrhosis showed significant improvement in disease severity grades from baseline to the end of follow-up. Conclusions: Penicillamine followed by zinc may be a safe and effective treatment in a resource-constrained setting for symptomatic patients with hepatic WM at all baseline degrees of disease. Some patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to WD can be managed with medical management, avoiding liver transplantation.

3374,Current and promising therapies for autosomal recessive ataxias,"Background & Aim: Ataxia is clinically characterized by unsteady gait and imbalance. Diseases of the cerebellum can have many causes, such as metabolic diseases, stroke or genetic mutations. Genetic causes are classified by mode of inheritance and include autosomal dominant, X-linked, and autosomal recessive ataxias. Many years have passed since Friedreich's ataxia, the most common autosomal recessive ataxia, was described, and mutations in many other genes have since been described. The genetic mutations mostly lead to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, which leads to the loss of the Purkinje neuron and eventually to cerebellar dysfunction. Unfortunately, recessive ataxias remain a poorly understood group of diseases and most of them are still untreatable. Conclusion: The aim of this review is to create a comprehensive clinical profile and review currently available therapies. We provide an overview of the physiopathology, neurological features, and diagnostic approach of the common recessive ataxias. The focus is also on potential drugs that are currently or will soon be in clinical trials. For example, promising gene therapies open up the possibility of treating Friedreich's ataxia, ataxia-telangiectasia, Wilson's disease and Niemann-Pick disease differently in the coming years.

A core biopsy showed the transepidermal elimination of abnormally thick elastic fibers with vertical buds. Movat staining outlined coarse, tortuous elastic fibers throughout the dermis in a ""bramble bush"" configuration. She was diagnosed with penicillamine-induced elastosis perforans serpignosa (EPS). EPS is a rare disease that often occurs in the context of underlying diseases such as Down syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos, but also after penicillamine therapy. Penicillamine, a heavy metal chelator, is used to treat various diseases including cystinuria, Wilson's disease, and systemic sclerosis. Long-term use has been associated with cutaneous adverse events in 20-50% of patients. Penicillamine-induced dermatoses include EPS, cutis laxa, or pseudo-pseudoxanthoma elasticum. Treatment of EPS is difficult and consists of intralesional corticosteroids, retinoids, destruction, and isolated cases of photodynamic therapy (PDT). The patient failed numerous intralesional corticosteroid injections and topical retinoids. She developed significant neck strictures and wrinkles that caused physical discomfort and social anxiety. Study: The patient was treated with aminolevulinic acid-PDT (ALA-PDT) once a week for 4 treatments. 1.5 ml of 20% ALA was applied to the neck and sealed with plastic wrap for two hours. The patient was then irradiated with a narrow-band LED at 630 nm 15 cm from her neck. The first treatment dose was 99 J/cm2 and the remaining three treatment doses were 130 J/cm2. Pain was rated on a numerical scale during and after the procedure. Clinical images were taken before and after each treatment session. Results: Clinical pictures showed a significant improvement in disease activity and patient satisfaction.

Liver biopsy confirmed ultrasonographically slight fibrosis/steatosis with slightly increased copper content; Wilson's disease and aceruloplasminemia were excluded by appropriate testing. Transferrin glycosylation was consistent with a CDG-II. Patient #5 (Italian, now 2 years old) showed a similar picture at 1 year old; he did not undergo a liver biopsy. Results: Exome sequencing identified all composite heterozygous mutations in TMEM199 (frameshift with a premature stop or missense change). Western blot analysis revealed the absence of TMEM199 protein in patient fibroblasts. Conclusions: Our patients have a recently described rare disease mimicking Wilson's disease with chronically elevated transaminases, low serum ceruloplasmin and copper caused by mutations in the gene encoding the transmembrane protein TMEM199. The mechanisms may involve at least a partial loss of one or both of the copper-transporting proteins ATP7A and ATP7B.",,"Poeta, M.;Zielinska, K.;Maccarana, M.;Mandato, C.;Ng, B.

3381,Causes of metallic taste in mouth,"Learning Objective #1: Evaluate a patient who reports a metallic taste in the mouth. Learning Objective #2: Check the difference for elevated copper levels in an adult. CASE: The patient is a 45-year-old woman with PMH of lumbar radiculopathy and Tourette's who presented to the doctor's office complaining of a metallic taste in the mouth for 3 weeks. She works as a flight attendant but has recently denied international travel. She refused new medication. Her medications included naproxen, oral contraceptives, and Botox injections for Tourette. Patient denies the possibility of pregnancy. The patient has already been seen by a dentist, emergency doctor and ENT for examination. Since the symptoms were believed to be due to a sinus infection, she had completed treatment with azithromycin. The symptoms improved after the first two tablets, but then returned. At the emergency center, the metallic taste was thought to be related to allergies, for which she had been taking loratadine with no relief. The ENT advised the patient to suck lemon drops, but these did not help either. The patient reported consuming pine nuts, which she believed could be a contributing factor. The clinical pharmacist was consulted to investigate possible drug-induced causes of the metallic taste. Previous literature included a case report of a patient who experienced a metallic taste after initial botulinum toxin A injections, but the symptoms subsided after subsequent injections. This has been thought to be due to their effects on zinc metabolism. After checking routine labs and heavy metals (ie lead, copper and mercury), our patient was found to have an elevated copper level of 197 ug/dL compared to a normal level of 72-166 ug/dL. The level of repetition was similar. BMP, CBC and TSH were normal. Wilson's disease was ruled out. It was determined that the copper increase may have contributed to the oral contraceptive that the patient refused to stop taking. The doctor also consulted poison control and occupational medicine to rule out occupational exposure. Treatment of the elevated copper level was discouraged. IMPACT: This case has been added to the literature on drug-induced metallic taste and underscores the value of a pharmacist in conducting a drug review to assess possible causes. DISCUSSION: The majority of taste disorders are the result of loss of smell, which can often contribute to allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, or an upper respiratory tract infection. Therefore, examination of the nose, mouth and cranial nerves are of crucial importance. Metallic taste can also be attributed to external exposure, pregnancy (which should be ruled out if necessary), or medications that affect the metabolism of metals such as zinc or copper, the levels of which should also be evaluated. In our case, the botulinum injections and oral contraceptives were considered as possible causes of the patient's symptoms. A third possibility was pine nut syndrome, as symptoms correlated with reported pine nut consumption.",,"Lu, C.;Lee, J.;Marrast, L. M.",2018,,,0,0,
3382,Unusual presentation of Wilson's disease in a pediatric patient: case report,"Aim: To review a case of an unusual primary neuropsychiatric presentation of Wilson's disease in a pediatric patient. Background: Wilson disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that affects both children and adults and typically presents with neuropsychiatric and/or hepatic symptoms due to copper deposits. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical findings, including the presence of Keyser-Flescher (KF) rings, and biochemical tests, and is confirmed by testing of the ATP7B gene. Neurological manifestations include choreoathetosis, dystonia, dysmetria, ataxia, and dysarthria. Psychiatric manifestations include mood disorders, behavioral changes including compulsions or disinhibition. KF rings are present in an estimated 90% of patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations. Pediatric patients typically present with hepatic symptoms and rarely only neuropsychiatric symptoms. Treatment is by chelation with copper (Weiss, GeneReviews, 2016). Design/Methods: NA Results: We present a case of a 10-year-old girl with subacute onset of dysarthria and ataxia with falls. The examination was notable for flat affects, disinhibition, and findings focusing on the cerebellum with choppy, smooth pursuits in extraocular movements without nystagmus, motor instability, dysmetria, ataxia, broad-based shuffling gait, positive Romberg, and inability to perform stress gaits. There was no choreoathetosis or dystonia, although the patient had dysarthria with strangely slow, halting speech. Laboratory tests revealed elevated transaminases. Neuroimaging was unremarkable and ophthalmologic examination showed no KF rings. Ceruloplasmin and serum and urine copper screening were of concern for Wilson's disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by ATP7B sequencing for the presence of two pathologic variants, c.3955C>T. The liver biopsy showed an increased copper content. Treatment with oral zinc was initiated and she had rapid improvement in neurological symptoms, became able to walk within a few weeks, and returned almost completely to baseline within a few months. Conclusions: This case presentation demonstrates a unique presentation of Wilson's disease in a child with predominantly neuropsychiatric symptoms who responded to therapy.",,"DiSano, M.;Friedman, N.;Parikh, S.",2018,,,0,0,
3383,Wilson disease. [German],"Wilson's disease is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism. The gene defect is caused by various mutations in the copper-transporting enzyme ATP7B, which is mainly found in the liver and brain.

The age of onset varies from early childhood to young adulthood and may even manifest at later ages. Clinical diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, biochemical, and molecular markers.

3384,Indian cirrhosis in childhood - Down but not out: report of a rare case with a practical clinicopathological diagnostic approach,"Indian childhood cirrhosis is an entity believed to be on the brink of extinction. We present the case of a 13-month-old girl who presented with acute jaundice, fever, and persistently rising bilirubin. Investigations revealed direct hyperbilirubinemia, elevated transaminases, anemia, blood low in schistocytes, a positive direct Coombs test, and an abnormal prothrombin time. Viral, autoimmune, and metabolic workup was unremarkable. Sonography revealed chronic liver disease, portal hypertension, and ascites. Due to numerous confounding factors and a low index of suspicion, the diagnosis of Indian childhood cirrhosis remained elusive and was only confirmed by a liver biopsy, albeit more than three weeks later, shortly after which the child died. The timing and technique of liver biopsy can have a profound impact on the ultimate clinical outcome. Close coordination between the clinical and pathological teams is essential for deciphering acute presentations of uncertain etiology. We highlight the clinical considerations, various morphological clues and offer a diagnostic algorithm that facilitates the consideration of this disease.

3385,Identification and characterization of a novel 43 bp deletion mutation of the ATP7B gene in a Chinese patient with Wilson's disease: A case report,"Background: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation. ATP7B gene mutations result in ATP7B protein dysfunction, which in turn causes Wilson disease. Case presentation: We describe a male case of Wilson's disease diagnosed 10 years after routine biochemical testing and exhibiting low serum ceruloplasmin levels and Kayser-Fleischer rings in both corneas. Analysis of the ATP7B gene revealed composite heterozygous mutations in the subject, including the reported c.3517G>A mutation and a new c.532_574del mutation. The c.532_574del mutation covered a 43 bp region in exon 2 and resulted in a frameshift mutation (p.Leu178PhefsX10). Two microhomologies (TCTCA) were observed at both deletion breakpoints in the ATP7B gene by base sequence analysis. Meanwhile, the presence of some sequence motifs associated with DNA breakage near the deletion region promoted DNA strand breakage. Conclusions: In comparison, a replication-based mechanism called Fork Stalling and Template Switching/Microhomology-mediated Break-Induced Replication (FoSTeS/MMBIR) was used to explain the emergence of this novel deletion mutation.

3386,Clinical presentation and outcome of patients with Wilson's disease in a monocentric cohort of liver reference centers,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that leads to cirrhosis of the liver and neurological disorders. Clinical data on larger cohorts are limited due to the low morbidity. The aim is to determine the clinical presentation and outcome of patients with MM in a cohort of patients from a French liver reference center. Method: This is a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with WM in a liver reference center (Paul Brousse Hospital, Villejuif, France). The patients were examined clinically, biologically, morphologically and genetically. Liver involvement was assessed by liver biopsy and/or measurement of liver stiffness. Results: We enrolled 107 patients with hepatic symptoms of WD, 54 (50.5%) females and 53 (49.5%) males, from 1974 to 2016. The median follow-up was 15 years [extr: 1-44 years] . Fifty-seven (53.3%) had neurological symptoms (mixed symptoms, neurological and hepatic) on admission. The mean age at diagnosis was 20.1 (+/- 10.54) years with an age difference between patients with hepatic symptoms (17 +/- 8.6 years) and mixed symptoms (23 +/- 11.4 years) (p=0.0081) . Pathologic analysis of the liver was performed in 65 patients (70%) and measurement of liver stiffness in 72 (67%). 73 patients (68%) had cirrhosis at the time of disease diagnosis. Forty-three patients (77%) had cirrhosis in patients with mixed symptoms and 30 (61%) in patients with isolated hepatic symptoms. Thirty-four patients (32%) were transplanted, with a mean age of 27 (± 12.2) years. Of the patients requiring liver transplantation, 18 (52%) had decompensated cirrhosis, 8 (23%) had fulminant liver failure, 8 (23.5%) had severe neurological disease, and 5 (14%) had liver cancer. The chelating treatment consisted predominantly of D-penicillamine in 104 (97%) patients. Thirty-seven (35%) patients required a change in treatment due to adverse reactions to trientine or zinc salts. Four patients died in this cohort; two after primary liver cancer (1 HCC and 1 cholangiocarcinoma), one after hemorrhagic stroke and one after liver transplantation because of severe neurological symptoms. Conclusion: At presentation of WM, two-thirds of the patients referred to a referral center for hepatology had cirrhosis and one-third required liver transplantation. Cirrhosis was diagnosed in 77% of patients with neurological symptoms of the disease.

3387,Phenotypic characteristics and improvement in measurement of liver stiffness during follow-up in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background and Objectives: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that results in hepatic and neurological impairment. The aim of our study was to assess the phenotypic and therapeutic specifics of WM patients treated in a tertiary-level hospital between 2012 and 2016. Method: A retrospective study was performed in 88 patients diagnosed with WM during the defined period. Results: An age at diagnosis under 7 years was found in 12.9% of cases, between 7 and 18 years in 44.7%, 18 to 35 years in 37.6% and > 35 years in 7%. At the time of diagnosis, 67% had liver disease, 27.3% had hepatic and neurologic disease, and 5.7% had neurologic disease alone. In patients with hepatic WD, 30.3% had compensated and 14.2% decompensated liver cirrhosis (LC), 50% had chronic hepatitis, and 5.3% had acute liver failure. In patients with hepatic and neurological impairments, 66.6% had compensated and 11% decompensated LC, and 22.2% had chronic hepatitis. Exclusive liver disease was identified in 77.7% of children compared to only 50% of adults (p=0.02). At last follow-up, treatment consisted of D-penicillamine 32.1%, trientine 8.3%, zinc 5.9%, D-penicillamine and zinc 41.7%, trientine and zinc 3.6%, with 8, Liver transplantation was performed in 4% of cases. In patients with liver disease, clinical improvement was seen in 65.8% of patients, while the disease worsened in only 20.3%. In patients with liver and neurological diseases, clinical improvement was observed in 59.1% and worsening in 22.7%. Patients with isolated neurological impairment had a favorable clinical course in 75% of cases, the rest deteriorated. Liver stiffness measured at diagnosis in all patients with compensated liver disease decreased significantly after 12 months of chelation therapy (14.6 +/- 10.9 vs. 8.4 +/- 5.1 kPa, p<0.0001). Conclusion: In a Romanian tertiary center, WD with a hepatic phenotype is most common, especially in children, and an exclusively neurological disease is rare. In all phenotypes, a favorable course of the disease with a significant decrease in liver stiffness could be confirmed in >60% of cases. Liver transplantation was performed in <9% of cases during the study period due to timely diagnosis and effective chelation therapy.",,"Iacob, R.;Iacob, S.;Oana, A.;Cristina, A.

3388,Long-term outcomes of trientine treatment in Wilson's disease: final results of a multicenter study in patients discontinued from d-penicillamine therapy,"Background and Objectives: Trientine dihydrochloride (trientine; UNIVAR BV) is a common treatment for Wilson's disease. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability outcomes of a trientine chelator-based treatment after discontinuation of d-penicillamine. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02426905. Methods: In a multicenter, retrospective cohort study, assessments were performed at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months and at the latest available follow-up after Trientine initiation. A total of 81 patients were enrolled in the study, of which 77 (95.1%) patients were enrolled in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed outcome of hepatic and neurological symptoms, additional efficacy analyzes included copper parameters, LFTs. Safety reporting included SAE and abandon rate. Results: Of the 77 patients in the ITT population, 16 (20.8%) patients were younger than 18 years. Reasons for discontinuing D-penicilamine were side effects (58 [75.3%] patients) or lack of clinical improvement (12 [15.6%] patients). On average, patients were treated with trientine for 73.3 (+/-74.76) months. The mean total dose per day during treatment was 1005.7 (+/-425.32) mg. Treatment with trientine improved hepatic symptoms in 49.4% of patients, with 35.1% asymptomatic, 10.4% unchanged, and 5.2% worsening, while neurological symptoms remained unchanged in 36.4% of patients, with 46.8% asymptomatic, 14.3% improved and 2.6% worsened. Overall, the median NCC concentration showed a decrease from baseline to last follow-up (n=35 [-0.613 +/- 1.7318]). A total of 17 (22.1%) patients experienced a serious TEAE. The majority of these TEAEs have been fixed, fixed or improved with sequelae. Only two major TEAEs were considered trientine-related and both resolved. Trientine treatment was permanently discontinued due to TEAE in 1 (1.3%) patient (anaemia). Two (2.6%) patients discontinued trientine treatment due to inadequate liver response. Conclusion: Anti-copper therapy with trientine was effective after stopping treatment with d-penicillamine. Trientine was well tolerated and rates of symptomatic worsening were lower than those reported in previous series. These results support the prominent role of trientine in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Weiss, K. H.;Manolaki, N.;Zuin, M. G.;Kruse, C.;Dhawan, A.",2018,April,,0,0,
3389,Long-term efficacy and safety of WTX101 in Wilson's disease: data from an ongoing extension of a phase 2 study (WTX101-201),"Background and Objectives: WTX101 (bischolintetrathiomolybdate) is a copper protein binding agent that reduces plasma non-ceruloplasmin bound copper (NCC) by forming tripartite complexes with albumin and increases biliary copper excretion. In a phase 2 study in Wilson's disease (WD), once-daily oral WTX101 rapidly reduced NCC-corrected (corrected for copper in tripartite complexes), improved disability and neurological status, and stabilized liver function over 24 weeks. We present preliminary 72-week efficacy and safety data from an ongoing extension of the Phase 2 study, the first prospective report of long-term disease control with WTX101 in WM. Method: All 22 patients completing the 24-week open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study elected to continue once-daily responsive treatment with WTX101 in extension. Key parameters reviewed through week 72 included liver status, NCC corrected, neurological status, safety and tolerability. Results: Mean ALT, International Normalized Ratio, Albumin, and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease Score improved or remained stable between weeks 24 and 72. Reversible ALT elevations requiring dose adjustments were observed in 39% of patients (at day) through week 24, were not observed in extension. Elevated mean (SD) NCC corrected at baseline (3.6 [2.1] mM) was reduced and controlled at week 24 (0.9 [1.0] mM) and remained under control at week 72 (0, 5 [0.7] mM), with concomitant continuous improvements in disability and neurological condition in most patients. Low platelet (56%) and neutrophil (32%) counts were common at baseline, with similar reports throughout follow-up; low hemoglobin was rare. Most cytopenias were not accompanied by low NCC levels and probably did not reflect copper deficiency. Two subjects had evidence of neutropenia accompanied by mild anemia and low NCC, possibly consistent with copper deficiency, at weeks 36 and 72, respectively; both responded quickly to dose reduction. Overall, the number of reported adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) decreased by more than 50% from weeks 1-24 (175 AEs and 11 SAEs) to weeks 25-72 (71 AEs and 4 SAEs). Between weeks 24 and 72, 89% of AEs were mild or moderate, with 89% considered unrelated or unlikely to be related to therapy. Conclusion: Once-daily treatment of WM patients with WTX101 for up to 72 weeks resulted in long-term disease control as demonstrated by sustained improvements in NCC, disability and neurological status, and stable liver function with a favorable tolerability profile.",,"Weiss, K.

Patients' clinical presentation can be ambiguous and initial misdiagnosis is not uncommon. This case report describes a 31-year-old male patient who was referred to our hemato-oncology department with pancytopenia and suspected liver malignancy. Further medical history revealed a history of progressive muscle weakness, ataxia, and gait disturbances over the past 4 years. These findings were previously interpreted as dissociative movement disorder and adjustment disorder and started on psychiatric medication. Consecutive diagnostic examinations revealed no indication of an underlying hematological disease, despite proven pancytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly. Elevated liver enzymes and history of progressive neuropsychiatric symptoms have raised our awareness of diagnostic modalities beyond hematologic malignancies. Finally, an ophthalmological slit lamp examination revealed a Kayser-Fleischer ring, which led to the suspected diagnosis of Wilson's disease, which was later confirmed by a liver biopsy.

3392,Pediatric Wilson's Disease: A Clinical Profile and Treatment Outcome Study from a Tertiary Care Center in North India,"Background: Wilson's disease is a rare disorder of copper metabolism. Its proteic hepatic presentations include acute hepatitis, acute hepatic failure, acute in chronic hepatic failure, portal hypertension, asymptomatic hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, and gallstones. Extrahepatic manifestations are also known. There is little data on this disease and its consequences. We present here one of the largest cohorts of pediatric patients with Wilson's disease treated at our center. Method: Clinical profile and outcome of 107 pediatric Wilson disease cases from 2006 to 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. Diagnosis was based on KF rings, low serum ceruloplasmin and high 24-hour urine copper according to standard cutoffs +/- liver histology. Cases with at least 12 months follow-up after chelation were analyzed. Outcome was categorized as (1) Complete improvement: Asymptomatic with normal synthetic function (2) Partial improvement: AST/ALT elevation and synthetic dysfunction resolving (3) Worsening: Deterioration of synthetic function or neurological status & (4th ) Death. Results: Of the 107 patients aged 3 to 18 years treated at our center, 60 (56.07%) presented with jaundice, ascites in 49 (45.7%), cola colored urine in 5 (4.6%) ) and encephalopathy in 11 (10.2%), gastrointestinal bleeding in 18 (16.8%) and additional gastrointestinal bleeding (cutaneous, hematuria, epistaxis) in 13 (12.1%). 4.6%) patients. Consanguinity was present in 15 (14%), while a Wilson family history (hepatic/neurological/hepatic with neurological) was observed in 44 (41.1%) patients. Clinical examination showed hepatomegaly in 88 (82.2%), splenomegaly in 69 (64.4%), ascites in 40 (37.3%), signs of cirrhosis (including clubbing, spider angioma, skin lesions) in 39 (36, 4%) and sunflower cataract at 39 (36.4%). 4 (3.7% of patients). Gallstones in 2 (1.8%), nephrolithiasis in 3 (2.8%), MPGN and pancreatic involvement in 1 (0.9%) were also observed. Familial Wilson disease was present in 13 (12%). 4 (3.7%) of the patients' parents (3 male and 1 female) were subsequently diagnosed. The mode of presentation was hepatic in 87 (81.3%) or hepatolenticular in 20 (18.7%). The PELD score on admission varied from 0-45.8 (mean 11.36). The Child-Pugh score was A in 53 (49.5%), B in 13 (12.1%) and C in 41 (38.3%) patients. A KF ring was present in 63 (72.4%) of the hepatic Wilson and 18 (90%) of the hepatolenticular Wilson patients. Serum ceruloplamine was low (\20 mg/dL) in 81 (93%) hepatic and 19 (95%) hepatolenticular Wilson patients. 67.2% of them had a value of ≤ 10 mg/dl 66 (73.3%) with value [100 lg/24 hours and 11 (12.2%) with value [40 lg/24 hours.

3393,Kidney involvement in children with Wilson's disease,"Background: Although renal involvement in Wilson's disease (WD) is rare, it is of significant importance because of the associated morbidity. Initially thought to be unusual, recent data indicate an increased incidence of kidney disease in children with Wilson's disease. However, very few studies have been conducted to elaborate on this finding. The aim of our study is to describe the prevalence of associated renal disease in children with WM. Method: This is a prospective observational study of patients aged 1 to 18 years previously diagnosed with WD who attended the liver clinic or were admitted to the pediatric department of KEM Hospital, Pune. Patients with pre-existing renal disease were excluded. Demographic data, laboratory data and sonographic findings were recorded. Standard definitions were used to define proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and hypercalciuria. The data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the z-score was calculated to determine the significance of the difference between the groups with and without renal abnormalities. Results: Of the 70 patients included in our study, 4 children were excluded because they had pre-existing kidney disease. Of the 66 patients finally evaluated, 24 were girls and 42 were boys. Kidney involvement usually occurred early in the disease course and appeared to be more common in children with WM at an earlier age. 60% of WM patients with renal manifestations had a positive Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring. RTA was reported in 11 (16.6%), hematuria in 8 (12%), proteinuria (non-nephrotic) in 6 (9%), stones in 5 (7.5%), and isolated hypercalciuria in 4 (6%) patients observed. There was no significant difference between MV patients with and without renal involvement in terms of hepatic, neurologic, or combined hepatic and neurologic presentation of MV. All children received penicillamine except two who received zinc maintenance therapy due to penicillamine allergy. Despite extensive literature searches, we found only two pediatric studies worldwide that highlighted the renal aspect of WM. The most commonly reported associated renal abnormalities in these studies were haematuria, proteinuria and renal tubular acidosis with or without hypercalciuria. Conclusion: Our study is the only study from India that sheds light on the unexplored renal aspect of WM in children. Further studies are needed to formulate guidelines for screening children with WM for renal abnormalities. [Table presented].",,"Shah, V.

However, studies in patients with Wilson disease (WD) are rare. Further studies comparing liver stiffness due to TE in hepatic and neurological Wilson are lacking. Our aim was to assess liver stiffness by Fibroscan in patients with hepatic and neurological Wilson's disease. Method: Twenty-five patients with well-characterized WD underwent TE by FibroscanR, Echosens 402, Paris, France, software-B21). The TE was performed in the right intercostal space in a resting position. The diagnosis of WM was made using the Leipzig criteria. All patients were in follow-up and stable on treatment with D-penicil-lamin +/- zinc. The Fibroscan values were differentiated between hepatic and neurological Wilson with regard to treatment and disease duration. Continuous variables between groups were compared by an unpaired t-test. P-value\0.05 was considered significant. Results: Twenty-five patients (13 with hepatic and 10 with neurological and 2 with both) underwent TE 3-4 hours after breakfast. Seventeen were men. The mean age of the patients was 20 years and the mean disease duration was 7.2 years. The demographic and laboratory characteristics between hepatic and neurological WD are shown in the table. There was no statistical significance between the two in all variables except Fibroscan scores. FibroScan values in patients with neurological WD were 12.94 +/- 5.03 (range 7-22) kPa and in patients with hepatic WD 26.7.6 +/- 16.06 (range 12.2-75 ) kKa (p-value = 0.003). Values above 8.4 kPa are considered serious by WD. Conclusion: Patients with WD have advanced liver fibrosis on TE. Patients with hepatic MM have significantly higher scores indicative of cirrhosis, while patients with neurological MM have scores indicative of severe fibrosis.",,"Joseph, T.

3395,Pediatric Hepatic Wilson Disease: Effect of chelation therapy and outcome in a large cohort,"Background: Due to the lack of exclusive literature on pediatric hepatic Wilson disease (WD), this study aimed to evaluate the clinical presentation and outcomes of children with hepatic WD. Method: MV children who meet > 2 of 3 criteria (serum cerulo-plasmin < 20 mg/dL, positive Kayser-Fleischer ring, 24-hour urine copper > 40jg) +/- liver histology who conducted in our department from January 2007 to June 2016 was analyzed. Patients with an adequate follow-up of > 9 months were assessed for response to chelation therapy. They were analyzed as the following categories: a) complete improvement (asymptomatic + normalization of transaminases, serum albumin and coagulation); b) partial improvement (asymptomatic + near normalization of transaminases + serum albumin or coagulation) c) progression (deterioration of synthetic functions, decompensation or death); d) drug toxicity. To determine the prognostic factors of outcome, the follow-up cohort was divided into 2 groups a) Good outcome (>9 months of follow-up with complete or partial improvement) and b) Poor outcome, defined by deterioration of synthetic liver functions, Need for liver transplantation, lost to follow-up within 9 months of initiation of therapy, or death. Result: 111 WD children aged 108 (36-180) months and PELD total score 16 (-11 to 60). Liver histology was consistent with WD in 68% (n=27/40). Figure 1 shows the representation and the result. Chelation was initiated in 84% (n=94). 14% (n=16) patients died in hospital due to advanced disease. 65 with a follow-up of 43 (9-144) months were analyzed for outcome. 92% (n=60) received D-penicillamine monotherapy and 6% (n=4) with additional severe neurological symptoms received D-penicillamine and zinc. Among those receiving D-penicillamine monotherapy, a positive result was observed in 58% (n=35). 13% (n=8) had drug toxicity and 12% (n=7) required supplemental zinc due to disease progression. 6% (n=4) were started on trientine. An overall positive result was observed in 70% (n=46). Table 1 shows the comparison of patients with good and bad results. In logistic regression analysis, of all variables, the PELD score and Nazar score were the best predictors of outcome (p<0.001). Conclusion: In this large pediatric experience with hepatic WD, we have shown extended clinical forms with different manifestations. The majority were manageable with D-penicillamine monotherapy. Adding or changing chelation is required in select situations of drug toxicity and neurological presentation. [Table presented].",,"Sarma, M. S.;Das, M. C.;Yachha, S.

3396,"High efficacy of D-penicillamine in Wilson's disease: Contribution of noncompliance to the occurrence of D-penicillamine treatment ""failure"".","Background: Wilson's disease (WD), a genetic disorder of copper metabolism caused by the mutant ATP7B enzyme, is characterized by decreased excretion, disordered accumulation, and abnormal deposits of copper that cause toxic damage to various organs. D-penicillamine (D-PCA) is a potent oral chelating agent for WD. Method: N/A. Result: A WD patient with clinical manifestations was reversed by D-PCA. However, the patient considered himself healthy enough to result in discontinuation of penicillamine. The recurrence of many manifestations of Wilson's disease has been reported, but regular follow-up visits have also been discontinued. In addition, his liver function began to deteriorate after alcohol consumption, with symptoms including progressive jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, migraines, lower extremity edema, and diarrhea noted. There was no sign of relief from Wilson's disease after taking a few pairs of Chinese herbs. Approximately 4 months after the administration of D-PCA treatment, improvement in jaundice and dysphoria, decreased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and increased ceruloplasmin, and stabilization in the neurological and hepatic examination radiographs were observed.

3397,Phenotypic features and therapeutic multidisciplinary approach in Romanian patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that results in hepatic and neurological impairment. The aim of our study was to assess the phenotypic and therapeutic specifics of WM patients treated in a tertiary-level hospital between 2012 and 2016. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in 88 patients diagnosed with WM during the defined period. Results: An age at diagnosis under 7 years was found in 12.9% of cases, between 7 and 18 years in 44.7%, 18 to 35 years in 37.6% and > 35 years in 7%. At the time of diagnosis, 67% had liver disease, 27.3% had hepatic and neurological disease, and 5.7% had neurological disease alone. In patients with hepatic WD, 30.3% had compensated and 14.2% decompensated liver cirrhosis (LC), 50% had chronic hepatitis, and 5.3% had acute liver failure. In patients with hepatic and neurological impairments, 66.6% had compensated and 11% decompensated LC, and 22.2% had chronic hepatitis. Exclusive liver disease was identified in 77.7% of children compared to only 50% of adults (p=0.02). At last follow-up, treatment consisted of D-penicillamine 32.1%, trientine 8.3%, zinc 5.9%, D-penicillamine and zinc 41.7%, trientine and zinc 3.6%, with 8, Liver transplantation was performed in 4% of cases. In patients with liver disease, clinical improvement was seen in 65.8% of patients, while the disease worsened in only 20.3%. In patients with liver and neurological diseases, clinical improvement was observed in 59.1% and worsening in 22.7%. Patients with isolated neurological impairment had a favorable clinical course in 75% of cases, the rest deteriorated. Conclusions: In a Romanian tertiary center, WD with a hepatic phenotype is most common, especially in children, and an exclusively neurological disease is rare. A favorable course of the disease could be confirmed for all phenotypes in >60% of the cases. Liver transplantation was performed in <9% of cases during the study period due to timely diagnosis and effective chelation therapy.",,"Iacob, R.;Oana, A.;Iacob, S.;Anghel, D.;Constantinescu, A.;Lupescu, I.;Popescu, I.;Gheorghe, L.",2017,,,0,0,
3398,Long-term outcome of neurological Wilson disease,"Introduction: The aim of the study was to characterize the clinical spectrum of long-term treated patients with Wilson's disease (WM) and to identify risk factors that influence the long-term outcome. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 30 WM patients treated for at least 2.5 and up to 31 years underwent a detailed clinical assessment, assessing clinical findings with 7 motor and 3 non-motor subscores and performing laboratory tests. A factor analysis of these subscores and laboratory parameters was performed to determine the items with the highest influence on the outcome, an ANOVA and subgroup analysis tested the influence of age, age at diagnosis and duration of treatment on the outcome. A correlation analysis was performed between the clinical subscores and the laboratory findings. Results: Three factors (F1-F3) characterized the clinical outcome (F1: tremor and pathologic reflexes; F2: dystonia and dysarthria; F3: cerebellar abnormalities and gait), and three factors the laboratory findings (LF1: serum levels of ceruloplasmin; LF2: liver enzymes; LF3: INR). Mildly affected patients had increased 24-hour urinary copper excretion, more severely affected patients had increased liver enzymes. Six of the 7 motor subscores did not change with treatment duration, whereas tremor (p<.04), total score (p<.02), and particularly non-motor items (p<.001) increased significantly with treatment duration. The outcome of patients with neuropsychiatric abnormalities was significantly worse (p<0.01) compared to the rest of the patients. Conclusions: Long-term outcome in WM is influenced by patient compliance and neurological comorbidity.

OBJECTIVE: To present bipolar affective disorder, fast cycling, and Wilson's disease: case report. METHODS (Case Report): The index patient, Mr. A, a 27-year-old male, who presented with characteristics of over-activity, over-cheerfulness, over-spending, increased sociability, and over-familiarity , decreased sleep for 8 days duration in August 2017. Upon detailed examination, the patient had a history of a major depressive episode with suicidal ideation preceding the above symptoms for a duration of 5 months from April to August 2017. This depressive episode was preceded by a hypomanic episode present in March 2017, lasting a few days, preceded by another depressive episode since January 2017. Intermittent euthymia was not observed. There is a history of depressive episodes in April 2014 that lasted 2 months. The patient was born by cesarean section with no perinatal complications. The patient had a history of repeated episodes of jaundice by the age of 9 and was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. The patient was treated with penicillamine-d and later received zinc supplementation. The patient's Wilson symptoms worsened in June-July 2017 and required hospitalization in neurology, although this was not confirmed by a change in examination parameters. The patient continues to take baclofen and zinconia to treat Wilson's disease. On physical examination, the patient had dystonia, incoordination, dysphagia. The patient's recent blood tests revealed normal blood counts and liver function tests, as well as serum copper. The patient was started on one tablet of oxcarbazepine up to 1200 mg/day and one tablet of quetiapine up to 600 mg/day with no change in symptoms for 3 weeks and one tablet of lithium carbonate was added.

3400,Wilson's disease (hepato-lenticular degeneration),"Background: Wilson disease is a neuropsychiatric autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive accumulation of copper primarily in the liver and various parts of the brain, namely the basal ganglia, midbrain and pons. The genetic defect is attributed to a membrane-bound copper-binding protein gene ATP7B (located on chromosome 13), which incorporates copper into ceruloplasmin. Impaired excretion of copper leads to its accumulation and the resulting clinical features. The patient may present with tremors, dystonia, stiffness, dysarthria, lively reflexes, and psychological and behavioral disorders. Neurological and psychiatric symptoms can appear at any time during the course of the disease. We report a case of Wilson's disease in a 26-year-old woman with psychiatric symptoms. Case summary: 26-year-old woman with a history of tremors, difficulty walking and speaking since age 10, complaints of nudity despite wearing clothing, touchiness when alone, and trouble sleeping for 4 months. Examination of mental status revealed tactile hallucinations, ideas of reference, anxiety, and dysphoric mood. Neurological examination revealed tremors, stiffness in the upper extremities, dysarthria, poor coordination, and vigorous deep tendon reflexes. The ophthalmological examination showed clear Kayser-Fleischer rings in both eyes. The patient had a ceruloplasmin level <0. 08 g/l, serum copper level of 29.3 mcg/dl, liver function test showed alkaline phosphatase levels of 144 U/l. MRI brain reported focal areas of T2/FLAIR hyperintensities encompassing bilateral thalami, midbrain and pons and mild cerebral atrophy significant for age.

3401,Case Report - Wilson's disease presenting as a psychiatric disorder,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder affecting copper metabolism and associated with liver dysfunction. It is a genetic disorder with hepatic, neurological and psychiatric manifestations. The most common psychiatric manifestations in patients with Wilson's disease include sudden and variable mood swings, angry outbursts, personality changes, depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. If the patient initially presents with psychiatric manifestations, this may obscure the primary diagnosis and therefore the diagnosis of Wilson's disease should be kept in mind. here we present the case of a 22-year-old man who initially presented with behavioral problems and was later diagnosed with Wilson's disease. Introduction: Dr. Wilson published the description of 12 patients presenting with extrapyramidal motor disease and an autopsy showing softening of the lens nucleus and cirrhosis. In the first description of 12 cases of illness, Dr. Wilson in two of his cases the presence of a schizophrenic-like psychosis. Psychiatric symptoms ranging from major depression, mania, antisocial behavior to psychosis have been observed in Wilson's disease. It was later found to be a genetic disorder, transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner, affecting copper metabolism, characterized by excessive copper deposition in the liver, brain and other tissues. The genetic defect was located on the short arm of chromosome 13 and affects the ATPase(ATP7B)1 gene in the liver, resulting in hepatic manifestations (40%), neurological manifestations (40%) and psychiatric manifestations in one fifth2. Neuropsychiatric and behavioral disorders are commonly reported in patients with Wilson's disease, with a lifetime prevalence estimated at 20–100%. We present a case report in which the patient initially presented with psychotic features, who was found on examination to have Wilson's disease. Case Report: A 22-year-old man, born to a non-consanguineous marriage from a rural background, was admitted to the psychiatric patient ward of the State Hospital for Psychiatric Services, Visakhapatnam, with complaints of behavioral abnormalities for a week with worsening symptoms since 3 weeks days. The behavioral abnormalities are in the form of decreased sleep, decreased appetite, increased irritability, excessive talking, excessive socialization, overbearing self-expression, increased religiosity, increased patriotism, abusive and aggressive behavior. He was reportedly treated with inj for aggression. Haloperidol the day before he came to see us. Birth and development were normal with no significant history. In the family history, his older brother was found dead in the fields when he was 10 years old and presumed dead from a snake bite. His younger sister died of jaundice and ascites at the age of 13. Before the illness, he is a happy boy with average academic performance and regular school attendance. General physical examination revealed normal vital signs with no jaundice, a ring around his cornea, a tattoo of an Indian map with a cross on his left forearm. Higher mental functions showed impaired attention span. He is well oriented in time, place, and people, and his recent/immediate/distant memory has been shown to be intact with limited abstract abilities. His neurological examination revealed no abnormalities in the cranial nerves, sensory system, and no signs of the cerebellum, with the motor system revealing tremors in the outstretched hand. At the time of admission, the mental status examination revealed a man of average build, wearing a dirty white uniform with a tie, and greeting the examiner as a teacher and saluting the examiner. He was conscious, uncooperative, failed to maintain eye contact with increased psychomotor activity and decreased reaction time, and spoke excessively loudly. Megalomania and second-person auditory hallucinations are present. He was irritable throughout the interview. routine blood tests like CBC, LFT, S. creatine, urine routine were done and found normal. He was provisionally diagnosed with manic bipolar affective disorder and initially started on oral olanzapine and injectable antipsychotics. The patient later developed tremors and slurred speech, for which trihexyphenidyl was added and lithium carbonate was added to improve affective symptoms. In view of the significant family history and the acute onset of behavioral problems, the case was further processed with a differential diagnosis of Wilson's disease. On the developmental screening test, his IQ was 84 with blunt normal intellectual functioning. Bilateral KF rings are present on slit lamp examination. His abdomen ultrasound showed chronic hepatic parenchymal disease. His brain MRI showed subcortical left frontal lobe white matter hyperintensity, right parietal lobe calcified tall granuloma and bilateral lens nucleus T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity suggestive of Wilson's disease. Urinalysis revealed elevated copper levels of 108 μg/24 hours and serum ceruloplasmin levels of. 46g/l. he was maintained on 15 mg olanzapine, 6 mg trihexyphenidyl, 900 mg lithium carbonate and 400 mg zinc sulfate. He improved symptomatically with treatment, was discharged on the same treatment. Discussion: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the liver's inability to transport and store normally ingested dietary copper, resulting in abnormal deposition of copper in the basal ganglia, eyes, liver, and other tissues . This is an unusual presentation of Wilson's disease, here the patient had a history of abnormal behavior for 7 days and with significant family history, and a differential diagnosis of Wilson's disease was considered and upon further examination he was diagnosed with Wilson's disease . The patient was controlled on olanzapine 15 mg and lithium carbonate 900 mg. Some experts believe that neurological and behavioral symptoms can be relieved with the use of Pencillamine (mosai et al. 1985). Some reports have called the use of antipsychotics inadvisable. There are reports of the effectiveness of clozapine in the treatment of Wilson's disease (Krim et al. 2001). There is an ongoing need to evaluate the effectiveness of different antipsychotics and chelating agents in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Jetty, R.

3402,"copper chelation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Open-label pilot study evaluating the effects of trientine on LV mass, myocardial fibrosis, performance and metabolism","Background: HCM is the most commonly inherited cardiomyopathy, but to date no pharmacological intervention has been shown to alter the natural history or outcome of the disease, so there is an urgent need for new impetus in this area. In addition, CMR appears to be ideally suited to characterize many of the key pathophysiological processes that dominate the disease. Copper (Cu) is an essential cofactor for a variety of metabolic functions, and while regulation of systemic Cu metabolism is critical to human health, free Cu ions are highly redox-active and therefore potentially toxic. We have previously reported abnormal copper homeostasis in patients with HCM. In short, we found significantly increased serum (free) copper and ceruloplasmin levels in HCM patients compared to controls. Given that disruptions in Cu homeostasis can lead to hypertrophic forms of cardiac disease (e.g. in Wilson's disease) and given that we have previously shown that Cu chelation occurs in the absence of Cu deficiency is able to reverse LVH and organ fibrosis via a Cu-dependent mechanism in both animal and human studies, we hypothesized that Cu-selective chelation with trientine would slow disease progression in HCM. METHODS: This open label pilot study evaluated the clinical efficacy and tolerability of trientine dihydrochloride in a group of 20 patients with HCM over a period of 6 months. Predefined endpoints included changes in LVM, markers of LV fibrosis, markers of LV power, and myocardial energy. 10 additional matched HCM patients were studied as controls. Patients underwent a complex assessment plan over 6 visits, including separate CMR and CMR-31P spectroscopy at baseline and at the end of therapy. Results: Trientine did not induce a significant change in blood pressure, heart rate, or BMI. LV mass decreased significantly in the treatment arm compared to the control group (-4.2 gv 1.8 g, p=0.03). A trend towards an absolute decrease in mass was observed in the treatment group (p=0.06). These changes were associated with a reduction in native T1 (1060 +/- 47 ms vs. 1049 +/- 42 ms, p=0.06) and a reduction in ECV (30.0 +/- 4.5% vs. 29, 5 +/- 4.0%, p = 0.06) ). In addition, significant improvements in global longitudinal strain were observed using both echo speckle tracking based and CMR feature tracking based technologies (-16.6 +/- 4.3 vs -18.9 +/- 4.4, p=0.01 and -18.3 +/- 3.4 versus -19.4 +/-3.4, p=0.03). Significant improvements in atrial exercise parameters were also noted, again with mirror switching between the two imaging technologies. There was a trend for an increase in the PCr/ATP ratio with trientine therapy (1.27 +/- 0.44 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.39), but this did not reach statistical significance. No significant increase in exercise time, VO2max, or AT was observed. Conclusion: Cu-selective chelation with trientine in a controlled environment is safe and appears to have beneficial effects on multiple disease imaging biomarkers. In fact, it appears to at least slow the progression of the disease. A larger, randomized, double-blind phase 2b study is now warranted.",,"Reid, A.;Miller, C.;Cooper, G.;Schmitt, M.",2017,August,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehx502.P4503,0,0,
3403,"WTX101 in patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease: final results of a global, prospective phase 2 study","Background and Objectives: Current therapies for Wilson's disease, a disorder of copper metabolism resulting from the absence or dysfunction of the ATP7B protein, are limited by efficacy, safety, and multiple daily dosing. WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a first-in-class copper-modulating oral agent that acts by increasing biliary copper excretion and reducing non-ceruloplasmin bound serum copper (NCC) by complexing with albumin. METHODS: In an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, 28 newly diagnosed Wilson's disease patients (aged 18-64 years, 46% male, 89% with some degree of neurological symptoms, and approximately 50% with cirrhosis at baseline ) received WTX101 monotherapy using a response-controlled dosing regimen with individualized doses ranging from 15-120 mg/day, mostly once daily. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to 24 weeks in NCC levels corrected for copper in tripartite tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin complexes in treated patients (NCCc). The end-stage liver disease (MELD) model and the modified Nazer score were used to monitor the stability and safety of liver disease. Neurological status was assessed using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: At 24 weeks, 71% of patients treated with WTX101 achieved or maintained normalized NCCc levels or experienced a >=25% reduction from baseline NCCc (p<0.001). Mean NCCc was significantly reduced from 3.6 µM at baseline to 0.9 µM at week 24 (p<0.0001). Mean MELD score and modified Nazer score remained stable over the course of treatment, indicating stabilization of liver function. Reversible asymptomatic liver laboratory elevations observed in 39% of patients (at a dose of 30 mg/day or higher) were generally mild to moderate and resolved with dose adjustments. Compared to baseline at week 24, patients showed significant improvements in mean UWDRS disability score (6.6 vs. 4.1, p<0.001) and neurological symptom score (22.8 vs. 16.6, p < 0.0001). No initial drug-induced neurological deterioration was observed. Conclusions: Final data from the first global prospective clinical trial in Wilson's disease demonstrates that WTX101 rapidly lowered and controlled NCCc, resulting in improvement in disability and neurological status with stable liver function and a favorable safety profile. These results, along with its simple dosing regimen, indicate that WTX101 has the potential to address several unmet needs in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Weiss, K. H.;Askari, F.

3404,Predicting a 'poor outcome' in decompensated Wilson's disease: does the new Wilson index help?,"Background and Aims: Recently, there have been conflicting reports on the effectiveness of the New Wilson Index (NWI) in predicting Wilson's disease (WD) outcome, the only available predictive model in WD. We therefore wanted to examine the prognostic value of NWI. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of eighty cases of WD presenting to this center from 2011 to 2016, 71 of whom were either acute in chronic liver failure (ACLF) or decompensated CLD. They have been treated with supportive care along with a combination of D Pencillamine and Zinc. Univariate and multivariate analyzes were performed to see the association of risk factors with a poor outcome (liver transplantation or death) at any time during the hospital stay. Results: Of the 71 WD cases, 43 survived with medical treatment: 7 of 22 ACLF and 36 of 49 decompensated CLD. Fifteen of 22 ACLF and 13 of 49 decompensated CLD had a poor outcome. On univariate analysis, bilirubin (mean difference 11.47, 95% CI 6.7-16.2, p=0.00), AST (mean difference 160.8, 95% CI 64.8-256, p=0.001 ), INR (mean difference 1.63, 95% CI 0.93). -2.33, p=0.00), NWI (mean difference 5.37, 95% CI 3.67-7.08, p=0.00), pediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD) (mean difference 11, 47, 95% CI 6.7-16.2, p=0.00). ), presentation as ACLF (odd's ratio or OR 5.93, 95% CI 1.97-17.8, p=0.001) and grade 3 or 4 hepatic encephalopathy (HE) (OR 48.5, 95% CI 5, 8-402.7, p=0.00) were significantly associated with poor outcome. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association with a poor HE grade 3/4 outcome (adjusted OR 33.47, 95% CI 3.6-310.4, p=0.002) and the PELD score (adjusted OR 8.3, 95% CI 1.9-35.1, p = seen 0.004). Upon further subjecting the group without HE or HE grade 1 or 2 to binary logistic analysis, the PELD score was significantly (adjusted OR 11.4, 95% CI 2.2-59.2, p=0.004) associated with a poor outcome . The ROC analysis yielded the best PELD score cutoff of 17.5 to indicate a poor outcome with a sensitivity of 84.5% and a specificity of 69% in patients with (AUROC = 0.843) or without HE (AUROC = 0.812 ) to identify. Conclusions: HE grade 3/4 and a high PELD (>17.5) are independently associated with a poor outcome in decompensated WM. NWI did not show a significant independent association with a poor outcome. Further studies are needed to develop optimal prognostic models for WD.",,"Alam, S.;Sood, V.;Khanna, R.;Lal, B. B.;Rawat, D.",2017,,,0,0,
3405,Clinical efficacy and safety of gandouling plus low-dose D-penicillamine for the treatment of Wilson's disease with neurological symptoms,"To study the efficacy and safety of gandouling plus low-dose D-penicillamine for the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD) patients with neurological symptoms. WM patients with neurological symptoms were divided into two groups: a treatment group (n=53) and a control group (n=50). The treatment group received anti-copper therapy with a combination of gandouling and low-dose D-penicillamine (10 mg/kg), while the control group received conventional dose D-penicillamine (20 mg/kg) as monotherapy. The clinical effectiveness, side effects and results of the various hematological and biochemical investigations were recorded and statistically evaluated. Overall, 98.11% of WM patients treated with the combination therapy experienced improvement in their neurological status (concurrent with a significantly improved Global Assessment Scale score or remained stable). Her white blood cell and platelet counts stabilized and her liver function improved or remained stable. The combined therapy also appeared to promote improved 24-hour urinary copper excretion. Only 15.09% of WM patients on combination therapy experienced adverse events, including neurological deterioration in 1 case (1.89%) and hepatic function deterioration in 1 case (1.89%), which was less common than in the control group, which received a conventional dose, D-penicillamine monotherapy. Treatment of WM patients with neurological symptoms with gandouling plus low-dose D-penicillamine is effective and safe. Copyright © 2018 JTCM.

3407,Recent trends in trace element studies in clinical medicine in Japan. [Japanese],"Deficiencies or excess intake of trace elements, including zinc, copper, selenium and iodine, have often been reported. Zinc deficiency is commonly seen in infants fed breast milk low in zinc, those on chelating agents, athletes, and patients with diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, or nephrosis syndrome. Menkes disease is associated with severe copper deficiency and there is no effective treatment. Selenium and iodine deficiencies are observed in patients receiving special milk feeds and enteral formulas with low concentrations of selenium and iodine, respectively. In contrast, transient neonatal hypothyroidism due to excessive iodine intake in pregnant women has also been reported in Japan. It is expected that joint studies by researchers and clinicians will help clarify the exact mechanism, diagnosis and treatment of these abnormalities.",,"Kodama, H.",2018,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1265/jjh.73.75,0,0,
3408,A case of acquired hepatocerebral degeneration presenting as hemichorea after liver transplantation,"Acquired hepatocerebral degeneration (AHCD) is a rare but pathological neurological manifestation of decompensated cirrhosis. Portosystemic shunt leads to manganese deposits in the basal ganglion, which are identified as bilateral hyperintense signals on T1-weighted MRI. The resulting neuronal loss leads to involuntary movements, cognitive dysfunction, parkinsonism, or cerebellar ataxia in the absence of hepatic encephalopathy. We present a case of AHCD with several unique features: 1) first presentation after liver transplantation (OLT), 2) no clinical or radiographic evidence of a portosystemic shunt, and 3) unilateral basal ganglia hyperintensity. A 57-year-old man with hypertension and chronic kidney disease (stage III) underwent OLT for hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis 3 years prior to presentation. Its post-transplant course was complicated by persistent alcohol abuse, steroid-induced hyperglycemia, and acute cellular rejection without fibrosis 4 months previously. Prescriptions included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone, nifedipine and insulin with questionable compliance. He had no personal or family history of movement disorders. His main complaint was progressive, uncontrollable right arm and leg movements in a writhing, non-rhythmic pattern for a month. He was fever free. Physical examination was noteworthy for right-sided hemichorea with normal strength, finger-to-nose test, reflexes, and sensation. He had no altered mental status, asterixis, nystagmus, hepatosplenomegaly, or ascites. The laboratory values were remarkable for total bilirubin 1.3 mg/dL, Alk Phos 43 U/L, AST/ALT 117/65 U/L, blood alcohol level 103 mg/dL. INR 1.0 and platelets 141 x 103/mu L. Electrolytes, glucose and creatinine were normal. HgbA1c 6.0%. Tacrolimus levels undetectable. Serum iron, zinc, lead and manganese levels were normal. MRI brain showing notable T1 hyperintensities in the left globus pallidus with no evidence of hemorrhage or acute ischemia (Figure 1). He was treated with haloperidol 1 mg twice daily, which slightly suppressed the hemichorea and allowed discharge with close neurological follow-up. Symptoms of ACHD often improve as the portosystemic shunt resolves after OLT. However, we present a case of new onset ACHD in a posttransplant patient with no evidence of a portosystemic shunt. This highlights that ACHS remains a poorly understood disease that should be considered in patients with typical findings and a history of cirrhosis even after liver transplantation.

3409,Incidental diagnosis of Wilson's disease: a case report,"Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism caused by the complete absence or malfunction of a copper-transporting enzyme, which is a transmembrane protein ATPase (ATP7B) encoded on chromosome 13. The incidence of this condition is observed in 1 in 30,000 people. The presentation of WD is variable and usually involves the hepatic and neuropsychiatric system, with symptoms ranging from chronic liver disease, compensated or decompensated cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic failure, dystonia, choreiform movements, tremor, gait disturbances, personality changes, and cognitive impairment attributed to copper accumulation . We present a case where routine imaging for an ongoing problem thought to be chronic pelvic pain led to the diagnosis of WM. A 28-year-old woman with long-standing depression and type 1 diabetes mellitus was admitted with recurrent abdominal and pelvic pain. She had been hospitalized several times to be evaluated for recurring abdominal and pelvic pain. Her initial episode of abdominal and pelvic pain was evaluated with an abdominal CT showing a pelvic abscess which was surgically treated with complete resolution and since then she has been extensively evaluated, including serial imaging during subsequent hospitalizations, which were negative for any acute process was. During this recording, a repeat CT scan of the abdomen revealed new-onset liver cirrhosis, which was absent from previous imaging studies. The patient denied alcohol consumption and after a negative infectious, autoimmune and hematological examination, a further laboratory examination showed low serum levels of ceruloplasmin (5.4 mg/dl) and an increased excretion of copper in the 24-hour urine (302 µg/d). Slit-light examination of the eyes was negative for Kayser-Fleisher rings. MRI Brain showed T2 high signal intensity in the pons. It was started empirically with zinc gluconate. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous mutation in the ATP7B gene and a diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made. The patient continues to receive zinc therapy and will be closely monitored as an outpatient for liver transplant evaluation. Diagnosis of WD is easily overlooked and, if diagnosed early, could potentially prevent or reverse many of its serious manifestations. Despite the involvement of the hepatic and neurological systems in imaging, our patient was completely asymptomatic, making this case unique. Our case further reinforces the importance of always keeping WD on the differential when evaluating patients with cirrhosis.

3410,Sailor on duty with acute Wilson's disease,"23-year-old, previously healthy US seaman has been evacuated from Bahrain after presenting to a local hospital with shortness of breath on exertion, abdominal swelling, jaundice, cognitive decline and months of fatigue. The patient had no medical or surgical history and was an infrequent drinker. The family history was notable for an uncle with schizophrenia who died of cirrhosis, presumably from alcohol, in his early 40s. Examination showed hypomimia, bradyphrenia, bradykinesia, Kayser-Fleischer rings, jaundice, new ascites, but no asterixis. The labs were notable for pancytopenia with platelets of 37K, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 111, and a Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. Alkaline phosphatase was 133, aspartate aminotransferase was 81, alanine aminotransferase was 57, and total bilirubin was 1.9. The presentation INR was 2.8, with a calculated MELD sodium of 26. Contrast MRI showed multiple basal ganglia signal abnormalities. Upon arrival in Germany, ceruloplasmin was low at 8 mg/dL. A 24-hour urinary copper collection was performed and treatment was subsequently initiated with oral zinc based on a presumptive diagnosis of Wilson's disease. A transjugular liver biopsy was then performed with an elevated HVPG of 12, confirming portal hypertension. Small esophageal varices were detected on EGD. Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with a worldwide incidence of approximately 1 in 30,000, resulting from copper accumulation and injury to affected tissues. Defects in the ATP7B gene, which encodes the transmembrane transport of copper within hepatocytes, play a role in the disease. Major clinical features include liver disease, neuropsychiatric changes, Kayser-Fleischer rings, and Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. However, given the significant variability in disease presentation, both the European Association for the Study of Liver Disease (EASL) and the American Association for the Surgery of Liver Disease (AASLD) have proposed criteria to support the diagnosis. Using the EASL criteria, the diagnosis was made approximately 8 days earlier, although the patient ultimately met the requirements of both societies. This atypical occurrence of jaundice and constitutional symptoms in a seaman on assignment highlights the potential benefits of EASL criteria not requiring 24-hour urine copper, which is not readily available in an area of operation.",,"Bridges, E.

3411,Copper failure in Wilson and Alzheimer's disease,"Copper failure is the cause of Wilson's disease (WD), a rare condition characterized by elevated levels of non-ceruloplasmin bound copper (non-Cp-Cu) and an elevated copper to ceruloplasmin ratio (Cu:Cp). Meta-analyses also show copper abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease (AD); However, a direct comparison of the biological status of copper in the two diseases has never been made. An assessment of serum copper status (copper, ceruloplasmin, non-Cp-Cu, and Cu:Cp adjusted for gender and age) and 24-hour copper urine assessment of patients with AD, WD (nine WD patients at baseline and 24 WD patients on D-penicillamine [D-Pen] treatment)] and healthy controls (35 healthy controls). In a sample of 385 AD cases and 336 healthy controls examined in previous studies, non-Cp Cu and Cu:Cp were higher in AD than in healthy controls (both P<0.001), but lower than in WD- patients at baseline. While non-Cp-Cu was similar in AD and WD, the mean of Cu:Cp distinguished AD from WD (P<0.016), with the Cu:Cp Cohen d value being 0.8 (indicating a large biological effect indicates) differed in AD versus healthy controls, which further increased to 2.2 in WD. 24-hour urinary copper concentrations in 35 healthy controls were compared to those at baseline in a population of AD patients analyzed in a previous study of the effect of D-Pen on disease progression. AD patients had higher 24-hour urinary copper concentrations at baseline (P < 0.001; AD 12.05 cups/day [median, interquartile range 7.85-22.50]) than healthy controls (4.82 cups/day ( Median, interquartile range: 3.31-7.43]) Copper levels in 24-hour urine above the cut-off value of 200 ml/day were found in 87% of WM and 78% of AD.

3412,When drugs aren't the culprit: Abnormal liver function in a patient with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Background: Hepatotoxicity is a known side effect of disease-modifying anti-inflammatory drugs (DMARDs). In juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients, transaminase elevations are common in patients receiving methotrexate and some anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha drugs. There is little evidence for optimal monitoring, interpretation of results, further investigation, or intervention. Objectives: We present an 8-year-old girl with polyarticular JIA and persistently elevated liver enzymes during the first 18 months of treatment, leading to further investigation and a consequent diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Methods: We conducted a retrospective case review. Results: A diagnosis of JIA was made after 6 years. She received steroid injections in several joints and was started on methotrexate. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was slightly elevated (59 U/L, normal range < 50) at diagnosis but normalized before starting treatment. ALT levels rose shortly after starting methotrexate treatment and remained elevated. Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) was occasionally slightly elevated, but other liver functions remained normal. In the months that followed, elevated ALT often coincided with upper respiratory tract infections. Methotrexate was omitted on a number of occasions because ALT levels were > 4 times the upper limit of normal. The dose was reduced and extended to fortnightly with improvement but not normalization of ALT. Infliximab was started after eight months because of ongoing active JIA. Liver function remained abnormal (maximum ALT 433 U/L) and was associated with new development of worsening abdominal pain and nausea at 12 months. A decision was made to discontinue methotrexate and infliximab. Baseline investigations for other causes of persistent hepatitis and abdominal pain were normal. JIA became increasingly difficult to control and was started on adalimumab. Eighteen months after the diagnosis, it was discussed with colleagues from gastroenterology. Further investigation revealed a low ceruloplasmin and an alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) carrier phenotype. A repeated ultrasound examination revealed mild liver inflammation and fatty infiltration. Serum copper levels and urinary penicillamine exposure were strongly suggestive of Wilson's disease. Liver biopsy showed increased copper levels and steatosis. Genetic tests are still pending. She was started on zinc acetate, with liver function returning to normal within weeks. Abatacept was selected for ongoing JIA treatment, with a reduced risk of associated liver disease that would interfere with surveillance for Wilson's disease. Conclusions: Wilson's disease is rare and transaminase abnormalities are highly variable. Early diagnosis and treatment, before organ damage has occurred, will optimize the outcome. However, as in this case, children are usually asymptomatic and abnormal transaminases are detected incidentally. Interpretation of blood results from pediatric patients on methotrexate is challenging and evidence for intervention is limited. In our case, there was no improvement in liver function with changes in drug therapy, prompting further investigation of the underlying pathology. The case demonstrates the importance of considering other causes of elevated hepatic transaminases during methotrexate monitoring and underscores the value of early discussion with gastroenterologists.",,"Bertram, L.;Kelly, I.;Raimondo, V.;Brennan, M.;Henderson, P.;Davidson, J.",2017,October,,0,0,
3413,Wilson disease. [German],"Wilson's disease is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism. The gene defect is caused by various mutations in the copper-transporting enzyme ATP7B, which is mainly found in the liver and brain. Clinical signs are highly variable, with any combination of hepatic and/or neurological or psychiatric manifestations. The age of onset varies from early childhood to young adulthood and may even manifest at later ages. Clinical diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, biochemical, and molecular markers.

3414,"The early history of manganese and the recognition of its neurotoxicity, 1837-1936","The history of biomedical recognition of manganese-induced neurotoxicity is also reflected, as is the ontology of parkinsonism. The first report of manganese-induced neurological injury was made by John Couper, a university doctor in Scotland, in 1837. He made it clear that the outbreak occurred among workers at the Charles Tennant bleach factory in the Glasgow area. The relatively new technology of chlorine generation using manganese was responsible for the novel exposure involved. At the time, this factory was the world's largest producer of hypochlorite bleach powder. During the 19th century, technological changes in steelmaking that required higher levels of manganese greatly increased demand for the metal. Nevertheless, more than six decades passed before the next reports of manganese neurotoxicity appeared. Two independent eruptions (both on continental Europe) were reported within a few weeks in 1901, one from Jaksch and the other from Embden. All housings were exposed to dust with a high manganese content. Up to the eve of the First World War, a total of 9 patients with manganese-related neurological diseases were reported in five separate continental European publications. Meanwhile, new technology led to another source of exposure. Magnetic separation techniques enabled the extraction of zinc from mixed ore that also contained iron and manganese, leading to the exploitation of a unique source of high manganese ore found in New Jersey. Not long after the introduction of this technology, Casamajor reported the first cases of manganism in the United States in 1912, detailing classic findings. Other cases from the same cohort were reported a few years later, with continued exposure due to World War I demand for manganese for use in armaments. The nosology of chronic manganese neurotoxicity has remained fluid, with significant emphasis on commonalities with Wilson's disease, a syndrome only recently described. A landmark 1924 primate study by Mella showed manganese-induced damage to basal ganglia; Data from human autopsy studies over the following years further supported the view that manganese toxicity constituted Parkinson's disease. As the 100th anniversary of Couper's first report neared, newer technologies (arc welding and battery manufacturing) were linked to manganese-related diseases even as mineral extraction increased as a global source of exposure.

3415,"Wilson's disease in children: A position paper of the Committee on Hepatology of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition","Background: The clinical presentation of childhood Wilson's disease (WD) ranges from asymptomatic liver disease to cirrhosis or acute liver failure, while neurological and psychiatric symptoms are rare. The basic diagnostic procedure includes serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper excretion. The definitive diagnosis of WD can be made using a diagnostic scoring system based on symptoms, biochemical tests to assess copper metabolism, and molecular analysis of mutations in the ATP7B gene. Pharmacological treatment is lifelong and aims to remove excess copper with chelating agents such as D-penicillamine, trientine, or to inhibit intestinal copper absorption with zinc salts. Acute liver failure often requires a liver transplant. This publication aims to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of WM in children. METHODS: Questions about the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of WM in children were formulated by a core group of ESPGHAN members. A systematic literature search on WM using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database from 1990 to 2016 was performed with a focus on prospective and retrospective studies in children. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. Expert opinion supported recommendations when the evidence was considered weak.

3416,Genotype and clinical course in 2 Chinese Han siblings with Wilson's disease who presented with isolated disabling premature osteoarthritis,"Rationale: Premature osteoarthritis (POA) is a rare condition in Wilson disease (WD). In particular, if POA is the only complaint of a WM patient for a long time, there would be misdiagnosis or lack of diagnosis and then delays in treatment. Patient Concerns and Diagnosis: Two Chinese Han siblings were diagnosed as WD by corneal KF rings, laboratory testing and mutation analysis. They presented with isolated POA during the first 2 decades or more of their disease course and were undiagnosed during this long period. The older sibling affected became disabled at the age of just 38 due to severe osteoarthritis. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed two composite heterozygous pathogenic variants c.2790-2792del and c.2621C>T in the ATP7B gene. Lessons: Adolescent-onset POA may be the only complaint of WD individuals for at least 2 decades. A long delay in treating WD's POA could result in disability in early adulthood. A detailed physical examination, specific biochemical tests, and genotyping by targeted NGS should significantly reduce the delay in diagnosis in atypical WM patients with an isolated POA phenotype.

Aims Patients and Methods/Materials and Methods: A 43-year-old woman with a 3-week history of rapidly progressive, severe atactic gait, paraparesis, dysarthria was enrolled in our neurology department. Clinical examination revealed marked anxiety, finger dystonia, bilateral pyramidal signs and clonus. Within two weeks the patient became bedridden due to severe gait apraxia. Blood serum transaminases were normal, ceruloplasmin levels were low, and urinary copper levels were high. Brain MRI showed symmetrical T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the pons, thalamus and putamen with a second MRI two weeks later also showing bilateral caudate nucleus involvement and supporting the clinical deterioration observed in the first two weeks after enrollment. Kayser-Fleischer rings were present during the ophthalmological examination. Because abdominal computed tomography showed normal liver structure, a liver fibroscan was performed, which revealed progressive cirrhosis. Genetic studies revealed a Glu1064Ala mutation on the ATP7B gene that is compatible with Wilson's disease. Treatment with penicillamine was initiated with a slow, gradual improvement in the patient's neurological status. Results Conclusion: The neurologically rapidly progressive gait ataxia and paraparesis as cardinal neurological signs in this hyperacute Wilson's disease with symmetrical bilateral involvement of the basal ganglia and pons without involvement of other brain regions.

3418,Copper and zinc homeostasis: lessons from Drosophila melanogaster,"Maintaining metal homeostasis is critical for many different enzymatic activities and hence cell function and survival. In addition, cells show detoxification and protective mechanisms against toxic accumulation of metals. Disruption of any of these processes usually leads to cellular dysfunction and eventual cell death. In recent years, loss of metal regulation has been described as a common pathological feature in many human neurodegenerative diseases. In most cases, however, it is still controversial whether such a dyshomeostasis is a primary or secondary downstream defect. In this review, we will summarize and critically evaluate the contribution of Drosophila to model human diseases that involve altered metabolism of metals or in which metal dyshomoostasis affects their pathobiology. As a premise of using Drosophila as a model, we will recapitulate and describe the main features of nuclear genes involved in copper and zinc metabolism that are conserved between mammals and flies. Drosophila exhibits some unique strengths to be at the forefront of neurobiological studies. The number of genetic tools, the ability to easily test genetic interactions in vivo, and the ability to conduct unbiased genetic and pharmacological screenings are some of the key advantages of the fruit fly. In this work, we will pay special attention to the most important results reported in fly models to unveil the role of copper and zinc in cell degeneration and their influence on the development and progression of human neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease, Friedreich's ataxia or Menkes and Wilson's disease. Finally, we show how these studies performed on the fly have provided further insights into the influence of copper and zinc on the molecular and cellular causes and consequences of these diseases, as well as the discovery of new therapeutic strategies that have not been previously described in other model systems.

3419,Wilson's disease in a cohort of pediatric patients in Slovakia. [Slovak],"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare metabolic genetic disorder. Patients can be asymptomatic for variable periods of time, or the disease can present with nonspecific symptoms to organ-specific disability. The diagnosis of the disease is confirmed by an analysis of clinical signs and the results of targeted examinations. If diagnosed early, the disease is treatable, with chelation therapy being the most important approach. Patients with acute liver failure are indicated for liver transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively evaluated a cohort of 17 patients with WM who were diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. Results: WD was confirmed in 17 patients aged between 3 and 18 years at the 1st Pediatric Department of the Faculty of Medicine and Children's University Hospital in Bratislava in the period 2000-2015. The most common presentation of WD was in the liver (n=13 patients; 77%). In two patients, WD manifested with acute liver failure in adolescence. A long-term increase in aminotransferase activity was observed in nine patients. In two patients we identified WD in the stage of cirrhosis. Neurological symptoms were observed in two patients. The most commonly confirmed genetic mutation in the Central European region, H1069Q, was confirmed in 6 homozygous carriers while 10 patients were composite heterozygous carriers. In one patient, a pathological mutation could not be confirmed even by extensive genetic testing. Three patients from the cohort of 17 children underwent liver transplantation, 2 asymptomatic children were treated with zinc, 11 patients were treated with penicillamine and 1 patient was treated with trientine dihydrochloride. Conclusion: WM is a rare childhood disease. Its most common manifestation is the hepatic form in the second decade. Diagnosis can be very challenging. There is not a single highly sensitive and specific parameter that clearly points to the diagnosis. The serum ceruloplasmin level is the primary screening test. Plasma levels of copper and renal copper excretion serve as auxiliary investigations. The gold standard for confirming the diagnosis is determination of hepatic copper concentration in dried liver tissue. Genetic testing is beneficial in confirming the diagnosis of WM, particularly in first-degree relatives and asymptomatic individuals. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent the disease from progressing. If left untreated, the disease is fatal.",,"Kosnacova, J.;Podracka, L.",2017,,http://dx.doi.org/10.14735/amgh2017476,0,0,
3420,Hyperammonemic encephalopathy and new onset seizures in a patient with roux and short bowel syndrome,"Learning Outcomes: Rare cases of hyperammonemia have been reported after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and separately after small bowel resection. Here we discuss a patient with hyperammonemic encephalopathy after RYGB surgery and small bowel resection, complicated by new onset seizures. METHODS: A 45-year-old woman who had RYGB surgery 15 years previously and small bowel resection 5 years previously presented with decreased oral intake, weakness, and altered mental status (AMS). She had a 7-month history of frequent hospitalizations for elevated ammonia and AMS, previously treated with rifaximin and lactulose. She was intubated to protect her airway. On admission to our ICU she was found to have elevated ammonia levels of 140 µg/dL (15-45 µg/dL) after already having been on rifaximin and lactulose for 4 days. The transaminase values were normal. A previous liver biopsy was found negative for cirrhosis but showed fatty liver changes. Previous workup for Wilson's disease was negative. These results strengthened the suspicion of a disruption of the urea cycle. Serum amino acid levels and urinary orotic acid were tested and showed elevated urinary orotic acid at 2.4 mmol/mol Cr (0.4-1.2) and low serum citrulline at 9 nmol/mL (17-46), arginine at 24 nmol/mL (32-120) and ornithine at 21 nmol/mL (38-130), indicating partial ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. After treatment with lactulose, rifaximin, and a low-protein parenteral diet, ammonia levels normalized by hospital day (HD) 8. Mental health improved and she was extubated and downgraded to the hospital floor. At HD10, she was readmitted to the ICU after recurring tonic-clonic seizures that resolved with Ativan. A micronutrient deficiency was assumed to be the cause. Serum electrolyte levels were inconsistent with refeeding syndrome. Serum laboratory values showed low levels of zinc, selenium and vitamin B6. She was put on phenytoin, lamotrigine, and clozabam. With the supplementation of these micronutrients, she remained seizure free. Results: Although rare, partial OTC deficiency can cause serious complications after RYGB and small bowel resection surgeries, even years after the procedures.

3422,[52] Follow-up of liver steatosis and fibrosis in children with Wilson's disease using transient elastography (Fibroscan),"Introduction: Liver damage in Wilson's disease ranges from simple steatosis, steatohepatitis to severe fibrosis. Transient elastography (Fibroscan Echosens) has been used in many chronic liver diseases for the non-invasive assessment of liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis. Our aim was to assess the change in liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis and liver function over time in children with Wilson's disease using Fibroscan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 33 children with a mean age of 11.5 years with Wilson's disease who were treated with either zinc or D-penicillamine. At baseline and after a mean period of 1.5 years, all patients underwent Fibroscan examinations with a mean (M) probe to assess liver stiffness (E) and steatosis (Controlled Attenuation Parameter, CAP). At the same time, repeated laboratory tests of liver function were carried out. Results: At baseline, our patients presented with slightly elevated liver enzymes ALT-49.5 U/I (27.5-69), AST-34.5 U/I (25.5-45.5), GGTP-26 U /I (19.5-35.5) and well preserved liver function INR-1.1 (1.05-1.16) [median, lower, upper quartile]. Initial Fibroscan showed normal median liver stiffness of 4.4 kPa (M-probe) (4.0-5.4) and slightly elevated hepatic steatosis CAP-257 dB/m (235-283) [median, lower, upper quartile]. After a period of 1.5 years, we found a decrease, but not statistically significant, in ALT, AST and INR in our patients. Only GGTP was significantly lower than baseline results (p=0.02). Likewise, we found no significant difference in hepatic steatosis (CAP) or liver stiffness by Fibroscan compared to baseline and repeat measurements. Conclusion: Liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis do not appear to improve significantly over the short follow-up period in children with Wilson's disease based on Fibroscan measurements. Transient elastography (Fibroscan) can be safely used to monitor liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis in children with Wilson's disease.",,"Janczyk, W.;Dadalski, M.;Socha, P.",2017,,,0,0,
3423,"[45] LiverMultiScan - new non-invasive method for assessment of liver inflammation, steatosis and fibrosis - preliminary report","Introduction: Liver biopsy (LB) is an invasive procedure for the diagnosis and therapy monitoring of liver diseases. We present preliminary experience with a new non-invasive method LiverMultiScan (LMS) for the assessment of liver fibrosis, steatosis and inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diagnostic or control liver biopsy (LB) and LMS were performed in two children with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and one with Wilson's disease. We compared the degree of liver fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis (based on LB) with the LIF score (based on multiparametric NMR, measurements of liver fat and iron content). An LMS analysis was also performed on a healthy child (as a control). RESULTS: In a 12-year-old man (recently diagnosed with AIH who was not receiving therapy) LB had 3<sup>rd</sup> grade fibrosis and 3<sup>rd</sup> grade portal and lobular infamation. LMS analysis reports closely correspond to these results: fat 0.7%, iron 0.9 mg/g, LIF score 3.08%. In a 16-year-old woman with AIH (on azathioprine) Biopsy showed: fibrosis 1c, portal (2<sup>nd</sup> grade) and lobular (1<sup>st</sup> grade) inflammation. In LMS: fat 3.2%, iron 0.8 mg/g, LIF score 1.97%. In a 7.5-year-old woman with Wilson's disease (on Zincteral) in LB: steatosis 3<sup>rd</sup> grade, ballooning 2<sup>nd</sup> grade, fibrosis 2<sup>nd< /sup> sup>grade, portal and lobular inflammation 1<sup>st</sup> grade. In LMS: fat 32.6%, iron 1.4 mg/g, LIF score 3.08%. LMS analysis in a 17-year-old healthy girl without liver disease revealed: fat 1.2%, iron 1.2 mg/g, LIF score 1.73%. Based on adult experience, a LIF score < 2% appears to be normal, and higher scores correlate with fibrosis and inflammation. Conclusions: The LIF score closely corresponds to the degree of fibrosis and inflammation in liver biopsy, and the liver steatosis described by NMR is also confirmed by liver histopathology. LiverMultiScan is a promising new non-invasive method that can be used to monitor liver disease in children. Larger cohorts are needed to confirm and further delineate these results.",,"Banerjee, R.;Janowski, K.;Wozniak, M.;Janczyk, W.;Chelstowska, S.;Jurkiewicz, E.;Grajkowska, W.;Pronicki, M.;Socha, P.",2017,,,0,0,
3424,Quantitative transcranial sonography in Wilson's disease and healthy controls: cut-off values and functional correlates,"Comparison of transcranial sonography (TCS) findings in patients with predominantly neurological Wilson's disease (WD) with those of controls and correlation of TCS data with the clinical profile of WD. Patients with WD (n=40/f=18) and healthy matched controls (n=49/f=20) were assessed for TCS, serum copper and iron parameters, and clinical scales such as the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS ), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Beck Depression Inventory. The cut-off values of the lens nuclei and the echogenic area of the substantia nigra clearly differentiated WM patients from controls (area under the curve: 95.4% and 79.4%). The echogenic area of the substantia nigra was significantly larger in male patients than in female patients (p = 0.001). Compared to the controls, the patients also showed echogenicity in the thalami and in the tegmentum/tectum of the midbrain; The width of the third ventricle was increased and the axial area of the midbrain was reduced. In the WD group, male gender correlated with the echogenic area of the substantia nigra (r = 0.515, p = 0.0007) and serum ferritin levels (r = 0.479, p = 0.002); Hyperechoicity of lens nuclei correlated with dystonia (r = 0.326, p = 0.04) and dysarthria (r = 0.334, p = 0.035); Third ventricular width correlated with dystonia (r=0.439, p=0.005), dysarthria (r=0.449, p=0.004), parkinsonism (r=0.527, p<0.001), UWDRS neurological and total scores (both r=0.504, p=0.0009), MMSE (r=-0.496, p=0.001) and ACE-R (r=-0.534, p=0.0004). The echogenic area of the lens nuclei allowed highly accurate discrimination between patients and controls. The gender differences in the echogenicity of the substantia nigra and in iron metabolism are of interest for further studies in WD. TCS reflects several dimensions of WM pathology that are distinct from healthy controls and correlate with various clinical features of WM. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier BV",,"Tribl, G. G.;Trindade, M.

3426,First case of cross-auxiliary double domino donor liver transplant,"We report a case of double domino liver transplantation in a 32-year-old woman diagnosed with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) and liver dysfunction. A two-stage surgical plan was designed and a domino graft was implanted at each stage. During the first phase, an additional domino liver transplant was performed using a domino graft from a 4-year-old female child with Wilson's disease. After removing the FAP patient's right liver lobe, the graft was rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise and placed along the right side of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The orifices of the left, middle, and right hepatic veins were reconstructed using an iliac vein patch and then anastomosed to the right side of the IVC. Thirty days later, a second domino liver transplant was implanted. The second domino transplant was from a 3-year-old female child with an ornithine carbamyl enzyme defect and replaced the remaining native liver (left lobe of the liver). To equalize function and blood flow between the two grafts, percutaneous transcatheter selective portal vein embolization was performed, and ""the left portal vein"" of the first graft was blocked 9 months after the second graft. Liver function indices, blood ammonia and 24-hour urine copper levels were normal at the end of a 3-year follow-up. These two domino donor grafts from donors with different metabolic disorders restored normal liver function. Our experience showed a new approach to solving metabolic disorders with domino transplants and the use of explanted livers from children. Copyright © The Author(s) 2017.

3427,Zeb2: inhibition of inhibitors in Schwann cells,"Schwann cell development is tightly regulated by the concerted action of activating and inhibitory factors. Most of the regulatory feedback loops identified so far are transcriptional activators that promote induction of genes encoding integral myelin proteins and lipids. The mechanisms by which inhibitory factors are silenced during Schwann cell maturation are less well understood. We recently showed that the transcription factor zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (Zeb2) has a central function as a transcriptional repressor of maturation inhibitors during Schwann cell development and myelination. Zeb2 belongs to a family of highly conserved two-handed zinc finger proteins and represses gene transcription by binding to E-box sequences in the regulatory region of target genes. The protein E-cadherin is known to repress during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in malignant tumors and mediates its functions through interaction with multiple co-factors. During nervous system development, Zeb2 is expressed in neural crest cells, the progenitors of Schwann cells, the myelinating glial cells of peripheral nerves. Schwann cells lacking Zeb2 cannot fully differentiate and are unable to sort and myelinate peripheral nerve axons. The maturation inhibitors Sox2, Ednrb, and Hey2 emerge as targets for Zeb2-mediated transcriptional repression and show persistent aberrant expression in Zeb2-deficient Schwann cells. While dispensable for adult Schwann cells, reactivation of Zeb2 after nerve injury is essential to allow for remyelination and functional recovery. In summary, Zeb2 turns out to be an “inhibitor of inhibitors,” a novel concept in Schwann cell development and nerve repair. Copyright © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,"Brinkmann, B.

3431,Clinical profile of patients with co-occurring Wilson's disease and autoimmune liver disease in a rural tertiary care center,"Background and Aim: The coexistence of Wilson's disease and autoimmune liver disease in the same patient is a rare entity. In this situation, combined treatment with steroids and D-penicillamine can be effective. Methods: We analyzed the clinical, histological, and laboratory profile of patients with chronic liver disease with the aim of finding the etiology of the disease after excluding common causes such as alcohol, viruses, and drugs. Results: Of 10 patients, 6 were male and 4 were female. The most common clinical manifestations were abdominal distension (80%), abdominal pain (30%), pedal edema (60%), splenomegaly (40%) and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (40%). Laboratory tests revealed anemia (50%), thrombocytopenia (70%), prothrombin time prolongation in (60%), normal liver function in 60%, abnormal liver function in (40%). Hepatitis A, B, C and E were negative in all cases. Serum cereloplasmin < 20 mg% at (30%), normal level at (70%). 24-hour urinary copper levels ranging from >200 inches (40%), 100 to 200 inches (40%), and 90 to 100 inches (20%). Autoimmune markers showed strong ANA positivity in (40%), mild positivity in (60%). AMA, ASMA, anti-LKM-1 were negative in all cases (100%). Liver biopsy showed features of autoimmune liver disease and PERIPORTAL copper deposition in 80% of cases, while 20% showed features of hepatic copper deposition. Conclusion: The coexistence of Wilson's disease and autoimmune liver disease is a rare entity and the physician should have a high level of suspicion in diagnosing the problem and concomitantly initiating steroid and D-pencillamine medical treatment in these patients (Figure 1).

3432,Zinc maintenance therapy after initial chelation with penicillamine for the treatment of symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease in a resource-constrained setting,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Experience with zinc in the treatment of symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease (WD) is limited. The study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of penicillamine followed by zinc in the treatment of symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed case records of 31 patients with symptomatic hepatic MM in whom disease severity (Child, MELD, Nazer, and New Wilson Index scores) and 24-hour urinary copper were compared at 3 time points - baseline at presentation, at transition from penicillamine to zinc, and at the end of follow-up. Results: Of the 31 patients with symptomatic hepatic WM studied, 10 had associated neuropsychiatric manifestations of WM. Penicillamine was switched to zinc sulfate either for financial reasons (in 28 patients) or because of penicillamine side effects (in 3 patients). The child's grade was A in 6 patients, B in 5, and C in 17 at presentation (baseline). The duration of initial penicillamine chelation therapy was 134 (2-320) weeks, the median (range) and subsequent zinc therapy was 363 (35-728) weeks. There was a significant improvement in liver function tests and disease severity scores (Nazer, New Wilson, Child, and MELD scores) with the transition from penicillamine to zinc compared to baseline. This improvement persisted through the end of the study period. Seventeen patients with Child's C cirrhosis were treated with penicillamine for 111 (2-320) weeks at presentation, followed by 344 (41-652) weeks with zinc, of which 15 had significant improvement in liver function and disease severity up to showed at the end of follow-up. 3 of 31 study patients died after 284, 112 and 437 weeks. No patient underwent liver transplantation. Conclusions: Penicillamine followed by zinc may be a safe and effective treatment in a resource-constrained setting for symptomatic patients with hepatic WM in all baseline degrees of disease. Our data also suggest that some patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease can be managed medically while avoiding liver transplantation.",,"Gupta, P.;Choksi, M.;Goel, A.;Zachariah, U.;Sajith, K.

3433,Pediatric hepatic Wilson disease: experiences from a tertiary care center,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Due to the lack of exclusive literature on pediatric hepatic Wilson disease (WM), this study aimed to evaluate the clinical presentation and outcomes of children with hepatic WM. METHODS: WM children who met >=2 of 3 criteria (serum ceruloplasmin <20mg/dL, positive Kayser-Fleischer ring, 24h urine copper >40mug) +/- liver histology completed in our department as of January 2007 administered through June were analyzed. Patients with an adequate follow-up of >=9 months were assessed for response to chelation therapy. They were analyzed as the following categories: (a) complete improvement (asymptomatic + normalization of transaminases, serum albumin and coagulation); (b) partial improvement (asymptomatic + near normalization of transaminases + serum albumin or blood coagulation); (c) progression (deterioration of synthetic functions, decompensation or death); (d) Drug toxicity Results: 111 WD children aged 108 (36-180) months had a total PELD score of 16 (-11 to 60). Liver histology was consistent with W in 68% (n=27/40). Figure 1 shows the representation and the result. Chelation was initiated in 84% (n=94). 14% (n=16) of patients died in hospital due to advanced disease. 66 with a follow-up of 43 (9-144) months were analyzed for outcome. 92% (n=60) received D-penicillamine monotherapy and 6% (n=4) with additional severe neurological symptoms received D-penicillamine and zinc. Among those receiving D-penicillamine monotherapy, a positive result was observed in 58% (n=35). 13% (n=8) had drug toxicity and 12% (n=7) required zinc supplementation due to disease progression. 6% (n=4) were started on Trientine. An overall positive result was observed in 70% (n=46). Conclusions: This is the first and largest pediatric experience with hepatic WD. The majority of hepatic WD can be treated with D-penicillamine monotherapy.

There are few reported series of this disorder in the pediatric age group. The study was conducted to evaluate the spectrum of Wilson's disease in children treated at our institute. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 107 children diagnosed with Wilson's disease over a 10-year period was performed. Results: The symptoms were jaundice in 56.07%, ascites in 45.7%, encephalopathy in 10.2%, bleeding in 29%, neurological manifestation in 21.4% and psychiatric manifestation in 4.6% of the patients. Consanguinity was present in 14%, while 41.1% of patients had a family history of Wilson's disease. The examination revealed megalyhepatolia in 82.2% of the patients, splenomegaly in 64.4% and ascites in 37.3%. Presentation was hepatic in 81.3% and hepatolenticular in 18.6%. Other causes of liver disease such as hepatitis A, E, B, C, AIH, PSC, overlap were excluded. KF rings were present in 72.4% of hepatic Wilsonians and 90% of hepatolenticular Wilsonians. Familial Wilson disease was present in 12%. Serum ceruloplamine was low in 93% of hepatic and 95% of hepatolenticular Wilson patients. 67.2% of them had a value of < 10 mg/dl. Copper was examined in the urine of 90 patients, with 73.3% having a value of > 100 mg/24 h. A liver biopsy was only possible in 50% of the patients.

3435,Fulminant Wilson's liver failure in children and adolescents: A systematic review of 274 cases,"Background: Fulminant Wilson's liver failure (WFHF) is a serious condition that typically requires liver transplantation (LT). Because of its relative rarity, WFHF has been difficult to study in depth. Data in pediatric populations (< 18 years) are sparse and limited to case reports and small case series. The objectives of this systematic review were to examine the clinical and biochemical features, treatment, and outcomes of children and adolescents with WFHF. Methods: Database searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. The search was restricted to English language publications published between January 1984 and March 01, 2017. Publications were excluded when pediatric data could not be extracted. Wilson disease (WD) was defined according to AASLD guidelines. Due to the heterogeneity of the definition of acute liver failure (ALF) in the literature, subjects defined as ALF by the authors of the paper were included. The following data points were extracted from articles: study design, initial clinical and biochemical characteristics, genetic mutations, treatment, and clinical outcome. If not reported, the following ratios were calculated: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to total bilirubin (TBIL) < 2 and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 4. Results: Total 56 (case reports (30) , case series (23) and cohort studies (3)) Manuscripts with 274 participants met the study inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were conducted in Asia (21), followed by 19 in North America, 15 in Europe and 1 in Australia. Studies ranged in size from 1 to 61 subjects with a mean age at presentation of 12.9 years (range 4.0 to 17.6 years). 74% (202/274) of all patients were women. Kayser-Fleischer rings were seen in 80% (153/191) and Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia was reported in 98% (61/62). ALP/TBIL and AST/ALT ratios were evaluated in 60 (22%) and 63 (23%) subjects, respectively, and were found to be < 2 and > 4 in less than 55% of subjects. 47% (128/274) of reported subjects underwent LT. Of these, 58% (74/128) received LT from a deceased donor and 20% (25/128) received LT from a living donor. The transplant type was not specified for the remaining subjects. Twenty-four percent (65/274) of the reported cases achieved spontaneous liver recovery using extracorporeal liver assist devices. Plasmapheresis was the most commonly used extracorporeal system and D-penicillamine was the most commonly used chelating agent in individuals surviving with their natural liver. ATP7B mutations were only reported in 21 participants, limiting the assessment of genotype-phenotype relationships. Conclusion: This is the first systematic review examining WFHF in a larger cohort of children and adolescents. The female dominance of WFHF is evident in this analysis. Remarkably, only half of the reported subjects required LT, while the remainder responded to drug therapy. This finding may be due to biased reports of cases describing the use of liver assist devices. It may also reflect subtle variations in the definition of WFHF disease. Prospective studies are needed to investigate the true frequency and necessity of LT in WFHF.",,"Vandriel, S.;Ayoub, M.;Ling, S.;Ng, V.;Roberts, E.;Kamath, B.",2017,November,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0000000000001805,0,1,
3436,A copper sensor for in vivo MRI,"Copper is the third most abundant transition metal in the body and a necessary nutrient for human growth and development.1 Copper is bound to a number of proteins and enzymes where it plays fundamental catalytic and structural roles.2 As a result of its redox activity, cellular copper homeostasis is tightly regulated and a disorder causes a number of diseases including: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, prion, Menkes and Wilson's disease.3 These diseases result in variations in the local concentration of copper ions from a few mM to several mM.4 Although the relationship between dynamic copper concentration and their physiological or pathological role has been extensively studied, information about the structural behavior under biologically relevant conditions remains poorly understood due to the lack of real-time copper detection techniques.5 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a valuable medical tool diagnostic T Technology that enables non-invasive, three-dimensional visualization of whole organisms w with high spatial and temporal resolution. The design of contrast agents that change the T1 relaxation times of water protons in response to a given analyte is of great importance for MRI. Several responsive sensors have been reported in the literature, including sensors for enzymatic activity, pH, pO2, glucose, lactate, and nitric oxide.6 Specifically for copper sensing, the first generation of copper-activated MR sensors was reported by Que, et al.7,8 Although promising, the reported copper-responsive MRI agents showed interference from excess Zn<sup>2+</sup>, which limited their use in MR diagnostic applications for Cu<sup>2+</sup>.7 Here we present a new copper-responsive MR sensor with a copper-selective detection motif (L). This sensor exhibits high selectivity for copper ions, exhibiting high relaxivity (r1) with a 42% increase in relaxivity upon binding to 1 equivalent of Cu<sup>2+</sup>. Interestingly, only when fully bound to Cu<sup>2+</sup>, the sensor shows an increase in r1 by 310% (21 mM-1.s-1) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Human Serum Albumin (HSA) . Using biochemical techniques, we have also shown that GdL forms a Cu<sup>2+</sup>-mediated ternary complex with HSA (GdL-Cu<sup>2+</sup>-HSA). Initial in vivo studies were performed to confirm the ability of GdL to detect fluctuations in hepatic copper levels using C57bl/6 wild-type mice (Figure 1). We observed a significant enhancement of contrast (~30%) in mouse liver with GdL, indicating hepatobiliary clearance. When treated with a copper chelator (ATN-224) 2 hours prior to GdL injection, contrast from the liver was significantly reduced (~50%) as shown in Figure 1. For the first time, a copper sensor could detect differences in extracellular copper levels in the liver. Our findings could pave the way for unique opportunities to explore copper's role in the progression of many neurological diseases, including Wilson's disease.",,"Paranawithana, N.",2017,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11307-01-017-1138-y,0,0,
3437,Functional characterization of the ZEB2 regulatory landscape,"Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) is an important central nervous system (CNS) developmental regulator. Although transcriptional regulation of ZEB2 is essential for CNS development, the elements that regulate ZEB2 expression have yet to be identified. Here we identified a proximal regulatory region of ZEB2 and characterized transcriptional enhancers during neuronal development. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing for active (H3K27ac) and repressed (H3K27me3) chromatin regions in human neuronal progenitors combined with an in vivo zebrafish enhancer assay, we functionally characterized 18 candidate enhancers in the ZEB2 locus. Eight enhancers drove expression patterns specific to certain mid/hindbrain regions (ZEB2#e3 and 5), trigeminal ganglia (ZEB2#e6 and 7), notochord (ZEB2#e2, 4 and 12) and whole brain (ZEB2#) was. e14). We further dissected the minimal sequences driving enhancer-specific activity in the mid-/hindbrain and notochord. Using a reporter assay in human cells, we demonstrated increased activity of the minimal notochord enhancer ZEB2#e2 in response to AP-1 and DLX1/2 expressions, while repressed activity of this enhancer in response to ZEB2 and TFAP2 expressions was observed. We have shown that Dlx1, but not Zeb2 and Tfap2, interacts with the Zeb2#e2 enhancer sequence in the embryonic day 11.5 mouse notochord. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we deleted the ZEB2#e2 region, resulting in a reduction in ZEB2 expression in human cells. We have therefore characterized distal transcription enhancers and trans-acting elements that control the regulation of ZEB2 expression during neuronal development. These results pave the way for future analysis of the role of ZEB2 regulatory elements in neurodevelopmental disorders such as Mowat-Wilson syndrome.",,"Yaacov, R.

3438,Immunoglobulin A nephropathy secondary to Wilson's disease: a case report and a literature review,"Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide and can be associated with liver disease. However, cases of immunoglobulin A nephropathy secondary to Wilson's disease are very rare. A 20-year-old Japanese man presented with microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, and renal dysfunction. Renal biopsy showed mesangial cell proliferation, immunoglobulin A deposition, and electron dense deposition in the mesangial areas, all consistent with immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Abdominal computed tomography showed hepatic atrophy and splenomegaly, and the diagnosis of Wilson's disease was confirmed with decreased serum ceruloplasmin levels, increased urinary copper excretion, Kayser-Fleischer rings, and copper deposits on liver biopsy. The patient was successfully treated with trientine hydrochloride and zinc acetate and showed improvement in renal manifestations. Wilson disease is a rare cause of secondary immunoglobulin A nephropathy. We recommend that Wilson's disease should be considered as a cause of secondary immunoglobulin A nephropathy in juvenile patients with hematuria, proteinuria, and splenomegaly, and suggest measuring serum ceruloplasmin concentrations and urinary copper excretion in these patients and the to examine Kayser-Fleischer rings.",,"Shimamura, Y.;Maeda, T.;Gocho, Y.;Ogawa, Y.;Tsuji, K.;Takizawa, H.",2018,2025-09-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13730-018-0365-7,0,0,
3439,[Morbus Wilson oder hepatolentikuläre Degeneration],"Wilson's Disease or Hepatolenticular Degeneration Summary. Wilson's disease, or hepatolenticular degeneration, is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism. The most common clinical presentations are liver disease and/or neuropsychiatric manifestations. Pathophysiologically, Wilson's disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which lead to defective biliary copper excretion and subsequent accumulation of copper in the liver and other organs. The prevalence is approximately 1:30,000, but penetrance, clinical presentation, and disease severity vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes to cirrhosis or acute liver failure with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms. For this reason, Wilson's disease should be suspected and ruled out in unclear liver diseases or neuropsychiatric disorders. The diagnostic algorithms are complex and include clinical tests, ophthalmological examinations (Kayser-Fleischer rings in slit lamp examination), blood and urine tests, genetic tests, imaging and histology. If the liver disease is compensated, treating copper-deficient Wilson disease (chelating agents, zinc) is usually effective. Liver failure may require a liver transplant, which corrects the underlying defect in copper metabolism. New drugs with improved efficacy and tolerability are in clinical development.",,"Mensing, B.;Nowak, A.;Zweifel, S.;Terracciano, L.;Bernsmeier, C.;Filipowicz Sinnreich, M.",2018,Nov,https://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0040-5930/a000995,0,0,
3440,Copper complexes in cancer therapy,"Copper homeostasis is tightly regulated in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells to ensure adequate levels for cuproprotein biosynthesis while limiting oxidative stress production and toxicity. Over the past century, copper complexes have been developed as antimicrobial agents and for the treatment of diseases involving copper dyshomeostasis (e.g., Wilson's disease). There is now a repertoire of copper complexes that can regulate body copper through a variety of mechanisms. In addition, many copper complexes are currently being evaluated for a variety of therapeutic indications (eg, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) that require a range of copper-related pharmacological effects. Cancer therapy is also attracting considerable attention, as copper has been recognized as a limiting factor in several aspects of cancer progression, including growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. Consequently, “old copper complexes” (e.g. tetrathiomolybdate and clioquinol) have been reused for cancer therapy and have shown anticancer activity in vitro and in preclinical models. Likewise, new tailored copper complexes based on structural and biological features ideal for their anticancer activity have been developed. Human clinical trials continue to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of copper complexes as anticancer agents, and considerable progress has been made in understanding their pharmacological requirements. In this chapter, we present a historical overview of the major copper complexes currently being repurposed for cancer therapy and highlight some of the more recently developed compounds that have shown promise as anticancer agents. We also provide an overview of the known mechanisms of action, including molecular targets, and discuss related clinical studies.",,"Denoyer, D.;Clatworthy, S. A. S.;Cater, M.

3441,D-penicillamine in combination with inhibitors of hydroperoxide metabolism enhances the response of lung and breast cancer cells to radiation and carboplatin via H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated oxidative stress,"D-penicillamine (DPEN), a copper chelator, has been used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, cystinuria, and rheumatoid arthritis. Recent evidence suggests that DPEN in combination with biologically relevant copper (Cu) concentrations produces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in cancer cell cultures, but the impact of this on cancer cell responses on ionization radiation and chemotherapy are not known. Elevated steady-state levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were observed in MB231 breast and H1299 lung cancer cells after treatment with DPEN (100 micromolar) and copper sulfate (15 micromolar) detected. Clonogenic survival demonstrated that DPEN-induced cancer cell toxicity was Cu dependent and mediated by glutathione degradation [using buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)] as well as inhibition of thioredoxin reductase [using auranofin (Au) ] was significantly enhanced prior to exposure. Catalase treatment inhibited DPEN toxicity, confirming H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a toxic species. Furthermore, pretreatment of cancer cells with iron sucrose enhanced DPEN toxicity, while treatment with deferoxamine, a Fe chelator that inhibits the redox cycle, inhibited DPEN toxicity. Importantly, DPEN also demonstrated selective toxicity in human breast and lung cancer cells compared to normal, non-transformed human lung or breast epithelial cells and enhanced cancer cell killing when combined with ionizing radiation or carboplatin. Consistent with the selective cancer cell toxicity, normal untransformed human lung epithelial cells had significantly less labile iron than lung cancer cells. These results support the hypothesis that DPEN mediates selective cancer cell killing as well as radiochemosensitization through a mechanism involving metal ion-catalyzed H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated oxidative stress and suggest that DPEN could be reused as an adjuvant in conventional cancer therapy.",,"Sciegienka, S.

WM patients with neurological symptoms were divided into two groups: a treatment group (n=53) and a control group (n=50). The treatment group received anti-copper therapy with a combination of gandouling and low-dose D-penicillamine (10 mg/kg), while the control group received conventional D-penicillamine dose (20 mg/kg) as monotherapy. The clinical effectiveness, side effects and results of the various hematological and biochemical investigations were recorded and statistically evaluated. Overall, 98.11% of WM patients treated with the combination therapy experienced improvement in their neurological status (concurrent with a significantly improved Global Assessment Scale score or remained stable). Her white blood cell and platelet counts stabilized and her liver function improved or remained stable. The combined therapy also appeared to promote improved 24-hour urinary copper excretion. Only 15.09% of WM patients on combination therapy experienced adverse events, including neurological deterioration in 1 case (1.89%) and hepatic function deterioration in 1 case (1.89%), which was less common than in the control group, which received a conventional dose, Dâ€ penicillamine monotherapy. Treatment of WM patients with neurological symptoms with gandouling plus low-dose D-penicillamine is effective and safe. Copyright © 2018 JTCM. All rights reserved.",,,2018,,,0,0,
3443,"Safety, Efficacy, and Biomarker Results of PBT2 in Targeting Abeta as Modifying Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Phase IIa Study","BACKGROUND: PBT2 is a metalloprotein quenching compound (MPAC) that affects the Cu2(+)""-mediated and Zn2(+)""-mediated toxic oligomerization of Abeta observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Strong preclinical efficacy data and the completion of early clinical safety studies preceded this Phase IIa study, which aimed to assess the impact of PBT2 on safety, efficacy and biomarkers of AD. METHODS: Between December 6, 2006 and September 21, 2007, ambulatory patients over the age of 55 were recruited for this 12-week, double-blind, randomized PBT2 study. Patients were randomized to receive 50 mg PBT2, 250 mg PBT2, or placebo. Inclusion criteria were early AD (minimum mental state examination [MMSE] score between 20 and 26 points or Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (Cognitive Subscale, ADAS) score between 10 and 25 points), use of a stable dose of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ( donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine) for at least 4 months, a modified Hachinski score of 4 points or less, and CT or MRI results consistent with AD. The main findings were safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints were plasma and CSF biomarkers and cognition. The analysis was intended to treat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under number NCT00471211. RESULTS: 78 patients were randomized (29 placebo, 20 PBT2 50 mg and 29 PBT2 250 mg) and 74 (95%) completed the study. Forty-two (54%) patients had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (10 [50%] on PBT2 50 mg, 18 [62%] on PBT2 250 mg, and 14 [48%] on placebo). No serious adverse events were reported by patients on PBT2. Patients treated with PBT2 250 mg had a dose-related (p=0.023) and significant reduction in CSF-Abeta(42) concentration compared to those treated with placebo (difference in least-squares mean change vs Baseline was 56.0 pg/mL, 95). % CI ≥ 101.5 to ≥ 11.0; p=0.006). PBT2 had no effect on plasma biomarkers of AD or serum Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) levels. The cognitive tests included ADAS-Kogge, MMSE and a neuropsychological test battery (NTB). Of these tests, two NTB executive function component tests showed significant improvement over placebo in the PBT2 250 mg group: category fluency test (2.8 words, 0.1 to 5.4; p=0.041) and trail Making part B (≥ 48.0 s, 83.0 to 13.0; p=0.009). INTERPRETATION: The safety profile is favorable for further development of PBT2. The effect on putative biomarkers for AD in CSF but not in plasma suggests a central effect of the drug on Abeta metabolism. Cognitive efficacy was limited to two measures of executive function. Future studies, which are larger and longer, will determine whether the reported effects of PBT2 on biomarkers and cognition translate into clinical efficacy.",,"Lannfelt, L.;Blennow, K.;Zetterberg, H.;Batsman, S.;Ames, D.;Harrison, J.;Masters, C.

3444,DASH for asthma: a pilot study of the DASH diet in poorly controlled adult asthma,"The objective of this pilot study is to fully provide confidence intervals on effect size, data on the feasibility of clinical trials and interventions, and procedural materials for a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) as an add-on therapy to standard of care adults with uncontrolled asthma. The DASH diet includes foods (eg, fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts) and antioxidant nutrients (eg, vitamins A, C, E, and zinc) with potential benefits for people with asthma, but it's not known if the whole diet is beneficial . Participants (n=90) will be randomized to receive usual care alone or in combination with a DASH intervention consisting of 8 group and 3 individual sessions during the first 3 months, followed by at least monthly telephone consultations for an additional 3 Months. Follow-up examinations are carried out after 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome measure is the Juniper 7-inch Asthma Control Questionnaire, a validated composite measure of daytime and nighttime symptoms, activity limitations, use of rescue medication, and predicted percentage of forced expiratory volume in 1 second. We will examine changes in inflammatory markers important to asthma pathophysiology (eg, fractionated exhaled nitric oxide) and their potential to mediate the intervention effect on disease control. We also perform pre-specified subgroup analyzes by genotype (e.g. polymorphisms on the glutathione-S-transferase gene) and phenotype (e.g. atopy, obesity). By evaluating a dietary pattern approach to improving asthma control, this study could expand the evidence base for refining clinical guidelines and public health recommendations regarding the role of dietary changes in asthma management.",,"Ma, J.;Strub, P.;Lavori, P.

3445,Complementary naturopathy in periodontitis,"This study aims to evaluate selected naturopathic medicines for adult periodontitis and to identify variables that influence successful outcomes when traditional and alternative approaches to the prevention and treatment of periodontitis are combined. The collaboration between Kaiser Permanente, Oregon Health Science University and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine provides an unmatched environment for such investigations. Periodontitis is one of the main causes of tooth loss and has a negative impact on systemic health. The limitations of traditional periodontal treatment have forced scientists and clinicians to explore new remedies, and naturopathy holds several promising interventions. Because they are used to improve elements of host resistance that are known to be important in periodontal health and disease, three naturopathic medicines are potential adjuncts in the prevention and treatment of periodontitis. Connective tissue components are broken down enzymatically in periodontitis. In natural medicine, Connective Tissue Nutrient Formula (CTNF) (Vitamins A, C, and D, Glucosamine Sulfate, Oligoproanthocyanindine, Copper, Zinc, Manganese, Boron, Silicon, Magnesium, and Calcium) is specifically prescribed to improve the integrity of key connective tissue elements and enhance their resistance to degradation. Periodontitis begins when the permeability of the oral sulcular epithelium allows pathogenic bacterial components to invade deeper periodontal connective tissues. In natural medicine, glutamine is prescribed to reduce the permeability of the oral intestinal epithelium membrane. Chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis during the stress response is a risk factor for periodontitis. Adaptogenic herbs (AH) (Panax ginseng, Withania somnifera, and Eleutherococcus senticosus) are prescribed by naturopathic physicians to reverse the effects of bacterial and psychosocial stressors. Because glutamine, CTNF, and AH target pathophysiological mechanisms known to underline periodontitis, they are compelling candidates for clinical and mechanistic studies of complementary medicine approaches to treating periodontitis. Kaiser Permanente adult periodontitis patients will serve as subjects and receive standard periodontal care. Three of the four randomly assigned groups will also receive glutamine, CTNF, or AH supplements. We will determine the impact of these supplements on clinical outcomes (attachment loss, pocket depths, indicators of inflammation, plaque composition, need for periodontal surgery, acute periodontal problems, tooth loss). In addition to completing the series of self-report measurements (stress, coping, quality of life), study participants will provide samples of blood, saliva, gum fluid, and bacterial plaque. These samples will be examined as part of the laboratory core to identify biological and genetic traits that correlate with successful results. The retention of portions of the specimens will allow for future study of additional variables as part of the development projects being undertaken as the Craniofacial Complementary & Alternative Center is established and Phase III studies are conducted.",,Nct,2001,,,0,0,
3446,The effect of a dietary supplement in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pilot study,"The prevalence of type 2 DM and related complications continues to increase. Diet is a major factor in the etiology of type 2 DM. Zinc and omega-3 fatty acid intake may modulate glycemic control, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory processes in the disease. Zinc is involved in many biological processes, including enzyme action, stabilization of cell membranes, regulation of gene expression, and cell signaling. Zinc supplementation has been shown to improve glycemic control in both animals and humans. Zinc's normalizing effect on glucose homeostasis may be related to its involvement in insulin metabolism. Zinc is involved in the synthesis, storage, secretion and action of insulin. Omega 3 also improves glycemic control and omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in patients with DM. Both zinc and omega 3 act to mediate lipid metabolism. Zinc supplementation has been found to be associated with a beneficial increase in HDL cholesterol levels in individuals with type 2 DM. Again, the mechanism may involve insulin, which has been proposed as an independent predictor of plasma HDL. Omega 3 directly activates transcription factors that regulate lipid metabolism and is known to lower serum triglyceride levels in DM. Zinc appears to affect oxidative stress-related parameters in DM via a number of mechanisms including regulation of copper, zinc superoxide dismutase, metallothionein , NF β B and nitric oxide signaling to affect positively. The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation with zinc and omega-3 fatty acids on hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in a population with type 2 DM. This study will recruit 48 postmenopausal women with type 2 DM. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 4 groups for a 12-week period: placebo, zinc, omega-3, or zinc + omega-3 supplementation. Usual food intake will be assessed before and after the trial period using estimated 2-day food records reviewed by a dietician. Blood samples will be collected from all participants at baseline (week 0) and then at 4-week intervals (weeks 4, 8, 12) by qualified phlebotomists. Blood samples are analyzed for plasma zinc, plasma lipids and fatty acids, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, and indicators of glycemic control.

3447,Efficacy and safety of WTX101 administered for 48 weeks compared to standard of care in patients with Wilson's disease,"This study is a randomized, rater-blind, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an individualized WTX101 dosing regimen, administered for 48 weeks, versus SoC, in MV subjects 18 years of age and older. Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 5 to 10 locations in North America and 15 to 25 locations in the rest of the world. Subjects who complete the 48-week treatment period will be offered to participate in an extension phase of the study to assess the long-term safety and durability of the treatment effect of WTX101. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of WTX101 administered for 48 weeks compared to the SOC on the Cu control in MV subjects 18 years and older. The copper control is evaluated by the percent change in non-ceruloplasmin bound copper (NCC) levels from baseline (Day 1) through 48 weeks. In subjects treated with WTX101, NCC levels are corrected for the amount of Cu bound to the WTX101 tripartite complex (TPC) (NCC-corrected).",,Nct,2018,,,0,0,

The 145 infants were either breastfed or fed one of two formulas that provided varying concentrations of copper. None of the infants reached the minimum copper intake recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). At 2 months of age, no major differences in growth or health were observed in infants fed different copper intakes. Infant birth weight correlated well with the ratio of maternal venous plasma zinc to maternal leukocyte zinc at birth. Maternal venous plasma copper and zinc concentrations at birth correlated with umbilical venous plasma copper and zinc concentrations. Infants fed formulas with higher copper content had low mean plasma zinc concentrations without a significant increase in mean plasma copper concentrations. The current WHO recommendations for minimum copper intake for infants fed infant formula cannot be met with currently available infant formulas and are likely to be incorrect.",,"Salim, S.;Farquharson, J.;Arneil, G.

WTX101 (bischolintetrathiomolybdate) is a first-in-class oral copper-modulating agent that increases biliary copper excretion and reduces non-ceruloplasmin bound serum copper (NCC) by complexing with albumin. Methods: In an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, 28 newly diagnosed Wilson's disease patients (aged 18 to 64 years, 46% male, 89% with some degree of neurological symptoms, and approximately 50% with cirrhosis at baseline) received WTX101 monotherapy using a response-targeted dosing regimen with individualized doses ranging from 15 to 120 mg/day, mostly once daily. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to 24 weeks in NCC levels corrected for copper in tripartite tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin complexes in treated patients (NCCc). The end-stage liver disease (MELD) model and the modified Nazer score were used to monitor the stability and safety of liver disease. Neurological status was assessed using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: At 24 weeks, 71% of patients treated with WTX101 achieved or maintained normalized NCCc levels or experienced a >=25% reduction from baseline NCCc (p<0.001). Mean NCCc was significantly reduced from 3.6 µM at baseline to 0.9 µM at week 24 (p<0.0001). Mean MELD score and modified Nazer score remained stable over the course of treatment, indicating stabilization of liver function. Reversible asymptomatic liver laboratory elevations observed in 39% of patients (at a dose of 30 mg/day or higher) were generally mild to moderate and resolved with dose adjustments. Compared to baseline at week 24, patients showed significant improvements in mean UWDRS disability score (6.6 vs. 4.1, p<0.001) and neurological symptom score (22.8 vs. 16.6, p < 0.0001). No initial drug-induced neurological deterioration was observed. Conclusions: Final data from the first global prospective clinical trial in Wilson's disease demonstrates that WTX101 rapidly lowered and controlled NCCc, resulting in improvement in disability and neurological status with stable liver function and a favorable safety profile. These results, along with its simple dosing regimen, indicate that WTX101 has the potential to address several unmet needs in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Weiss, K. H.;Askari, F.

3451,"A randomized, two-center, feasibility controlled study of insulin pump therapy in young children with diabetes","OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine whether continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) can be safely used in young children compared to these continued multiple daily injections (MDIs), whether those receiving CSII have superior glycemic control when patients Those who use CSII have less hypoglycemia for their control level, and when families using CSII report an improved quality of life. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized 1-year feasibility study comparing CSII with continued MDIs in preschool children with a history of type 1 diabetes for at least 6 months. Prospective outcomes included measures of overall glycemic control (HbA1c and continuous glucose monitoring system), incidence of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, percentage of glucose levels below 3.9 mmol/L, and parental quality of life reports. RESULTS: The age of the 19 subjects ranged from 1.7 to 6.1 (mean 3.6) years, the duration of diabetes ranged from 0.6 to 2.6 (mean 1.4) years and the baseline HbA1c was between 6.7 and 9.6% (mean 7.9%). Seven subjects were male. Nine subjects were randomized to start on CSII and 10 to continue on MDI. All baseline traits were well balanced. Overall metabolic control, diabetic quality of life, and incidence of hypoglycemia were similar in both groups.

The purpose of this prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to determine whether GCM reduces the incidence of vomiting, diarrhea, and changes in appetite during the initiation of ciclosporin (Atopica; Novartis Animal Health) therapy for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. Sixty privately owned dogs diagnosed with atopic dermatitis were randomly assigned to GCM (n=30) or placebo (n=30) groups. All dogs received ~5 mg/kg ciclosporin once daily (range 3.5-5.8 mg/kg). Dogs < 13.6 kg received half a tablet of GCM or placebo; Dogs > 13.6 kg received one tablet once daily. GastriCalm or placebo was administered 30 minutes before the meal and the ciclosporin was administered 2 hours after feeding. The owners experienced episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, and changes in appetite. The dogs were examined on days 0 and 14. Forty-one of 60 dogs (68.3%) had at least one episode of vomiting, diarrhea, or change in appetite, leaving nine placebo dogs (30%) and ten GCM dogs (33.3%) free of adverse events (AEs). Twenty-seven of 60 dogs (45%) vomited and 15 of 60 (25%) had diarrhea. There was no significant difference in episodes of individual AEs, but the placebo group had a significantly lower total AEs score (sum of episodes of appetite change, vomiting, and diarrhea; P=0.022).

This study was designed to investigate the effect of BMSC treatment on hepatolenticular degeneration-induced liver fibrosis and the impact on serological indicators. Sixty patients with hepatolenticular degeneration-induced liver fibrosis were randomly divided into two groups, a penicillamine group and a BMSCs plus penicillamine group of 30 patients each. The therapeutic effect on liver fibrosis, liver function and serological indicators were recorded before and after treatment and the data were compared. After treatment, serum levels of HA, PCIII, LN, CIV, TIMP 1 and MMP 1 were reduced in both groups (p<0.05). However, cytokine levels in the BMSCs plus penicillamine group were significantly lower than in the penicillamine group (p<0.05). Combination therapy with BMSCs and penicillamine had a significant positive effect on hepatic fibrosis induced by hepatolenticular degeneration.
