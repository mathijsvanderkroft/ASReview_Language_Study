1,10024335,Distinct and combined vascular effects of ACE blockade and HMG-CoA reductase inhibition in hypertensive subjects.,,"Nazzaro, P; Manzari, M; Merlo, M; Triggiani, R; Scarano, A; Ciancio, L; Pirrelli, A","Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are frequently associated with elevated sympathetic activity. Both are independent cardiovascular risk factors and both affect endothelium-mediated vasodilation. To identify the effects of hypocholesterolemic and antihypertensive treatments on vascular reactivity and vasodilator capacity, we studied 30 hypercholesterolemic hypertensive subjects. They received placebo for 4 weeks, enalapril or simvastatin for 14 weeks, and finally both drugs for a further 14 weeks. Postischemic forearm blood flow (MFBF) and minimal vascular resistance (mFVR) were used as indices of vasodilator capacity and structural vascular damage, respectively. Total cardiovascular reactivity (rest-stress-recovery phases) (blood pressure [BP] and heart rate [HR]) and regional hemodynamics (FBF and FVR) to stressful stimuli were calculated as area under the curve (auc) (value x time). ). Compared to baseline, simvastatin lowered total cholesterol (TOT-C) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) (1.27 mmol/L, P<0.001 and 1.33 mmol/L, P<0.001, respectively) . Enalapril also reduced TOT-C and LDL-C (0.6 mmol/L, P<0.001 and 0.58 mmol/L, P<0.05, respectively). MFBF increased substantially with both treatments (P<0.001). Enalapril had a greater effect (-1.7 arbitrary units (AU), P < 0.001) than simvastatin (-0.6 AU, P < 0.05) on mFVR. During stress, FBF increased more with enalapril (4.4 FBFxminutes, P < 0.001) than with simvastatin (1.8 FBFxminutes, P < 0.01). In contrast, the FVR stress response was reduced more by enalapril (9.1 FVRxminutes, P<0.001) than by simvastatin (2.9 FVRxminutes, P<0.01). During combination treatment, a significant additive effect (0.001>P<0.05) was shown on hypercholesterolemia, structural vascular damage, BP, and RVF. The findings suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition induces a greater reduction than HMG-CoA reductase blockade in vascular reactivity and structural damage in hypertensive hypercholesterolemic subjects.",0,0
2,10027665,Computerized surveillance of adverse drug reactions in the hospital: implementation.,,"Levy, M; Azaz-Livshits, T; Sadan, B; Shalit, M; Geisslinger, G; Brune, K","Implement and measure the effects of computerized automatic laboratory signals (ALS) as a support tool for the detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the hospital; This was a prospective observational study of a total of 192 patients (199 sequential medical admissions) over a 2-month period in a 34-bed medical ward at Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. The study involved the routine (daily) distribution to staff physicians of lists of automated signals generated from computerized laboratory data as potential indicators of ADRs. The clinical pharmacology team reviewed patient charts for ADRs and to see if they were recognized by staff physicians; Seventy-one ADRs were detected in 64 of 199 (32%) admissions. 27% of ADRs were serious, 9% of admissions were due to ADRs. 295 ALS were generated, accounting for 69% of admissions. Sixty-one percent of ADRs were identified by ALS. ALS was present in 58% of ADR negative admissions. 85% of ADRs were recognized as such and 19% of ALS-positive ADRs were not recognized by staff physicians; Routine implementation of ALS doubled the number of ADRs recognized by physicians while patients were hospitalized on the medical ward. The use of the system seemed valid, simple and potentially profitable.",0,0
3,10027935,Selective glomerular size dysfunction in NIDDM is not ameliorated by ACE inhibition or calcium channel blockade.,,"Ruggenenti, P; Mosconi, L; Sangalli, F; Casiraghi, F; Gambara, V; Remuzzi, G; Remuzzi, A","In patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and overt kidney disease, the size selectivity of the glomerular barrier progressively deteriorates over time and is effectively improved by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Whether similar glomerular functional changes develop in proteinuric patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and whether antihypertensive agents may favorably affect glomerular filtration of macromolecules in these patients remains to be documented; We investigated the renal hemodynamics and fractional clearance of graded neutral dextrans in nine proteinuric patients with NIDDM and renal biopsy findings of typical diabetic glomerulopathy. Six healthy volunteers served as controls. We also investigated the effects of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker, both given at doses aimed at achieving a comparable level of systemic blood pressure control, on glomerular hemodynamics and screening function. Theoretical analysis of glomerular macromolecule transport was adopted to assess the intrinsic permeability properties of the glomerular membrane.; The fractional clearance of large macromolecules (42 to 66 A radius) was significantly higher in diabetic patients than in controls, and the distribution of membrane pore radii was estimated to shift toward larger pore sizes in diabetics (mean radius increased from 55 to 60 A). Despite effective blood pressure control, none of the antihypertensives significantly affected glomerular hemodynamics. The fractional clearance of dextrans, as well as of albumin and IgG, and total urinary proteins did not change with any of the treatments; These data indicate that patients with NIDDM and overt kidney disease develop abnormalities in the size-selective function of the glomerular barrier and, unlike IDDM, such changes were not ameliorated by either ACE inhibition or calcium channel blockade. .",0,0
4,10028936,Total arterial compliance in ambulatory hypertension during selective beta1-adrenergic receptor blockade and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.,,"Soma, J; Aakhus, S; Dahl, K; WiderÃ¸e, T E; Skjaerpe, T","Estimates of aortic root flow and pressure were obtained noninvasively with Doppler echocardiography and calibrated subclavian artery pulse tracking in 30 subjects with ambulatory hypertension in a randomized crossover study with 4 weeks of treatment and washout periods. Total arterial compliance, assessed using a three-element Windkessel model of the arterial tree, was increased by 42% with atenolol (50-100 mg once daily) and 7% (p = NS) with captopril (25- 50 mg twice a day). ). Atenolol reduced mean arterial pressure by 15%, heart rate by 22%, and cardiac output by 14%, and increased aortic root flow acceleration time by 17% and stroke volume and heart rate. ejection time by 11% each. Captopril reduced mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance by 7% each. Captopril did not significantly change aortic root flow acceleration time, ejection time, heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output. We conclude that total arterial compliance, at operating blood pressure, is increased during selective beta1-adrenergic receptor blockade in subjects with ambulatory hypertension. Although the primary mechanism may be a reduction in mean arterial pressure, it should be considered whether heart rate reduction may play an additional role. The nonsignificant increase in total arterial compliance during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may be primarily a consequence of a modest reduction in mean arterial pressure.",0,0
5,10029645,Racial differences in the outcome of left ventricular dysfunction.,,"Dries, D L; Exner, D V; Gersh, B J; Cooper, H A; Carson, P E; Domanski, M J","Population-based studies have found that black patients with congestive heart failure have a higher mortality rate than whites with the same condition. This finding has been attributed to differences in the severity, causes, and treatment of heart failure, the prevalence of coexisting conditions, and socioeconomic factors. Although these factors probably explain some of the higher CHF mortality among blacks, we hypothesized that racial differences in the natural history of left ventricular dysfunction might also play a role.; Using data from the Prevention and Treatment of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) studies, in which all patients received standardized therapy and follow-up, we performed a retrospective analysis of asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction outcomes among white and white participants. blacks. . Mean (+/-SD) follow-up was 34.2+/-14.0 months in the prevention trial and 32.3+/-14.8 months in the treatment trial among black and white participants; The overall mortality rates in the prevention trial were 8.1 per 100 person-years for blacks and 5.1 per 100 person-years for whites. In the treatment trial, the rates were 16.7 per 100 person-years and 13.4 per 100 person-years, respectively. After adjusting for age, coexisting conditions, severity and causes of heart failure, and medication use, blacks had a higher risk of death from all causes in both the SOLVD prevention trial (relative risk, 1.36; confidence interval 95 percent, 1.06 to 1.74; P=0.02) and treatment trial (relative risk, 1.25; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.50; P= 0.02). In both trials, blacks were also at increased risk of death from pump failure and from the combined end point of death from any cause or hospitalization for heart failure, our two predefined indicators of progression of left ventricular systolic dysfunction; Blacks with mild to moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction appear to be at higher risk of heart failure progression and death from any cause than similarly treated whites. These results suggest that there may be racial differences in the outcome of asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction.",1,0
6,10029788,Exfoliative dermatitis.,,"Karakayli, G; Beckham, G; Orengo, I; Rosen, T","Exfoliative dermatitis, also known as erythroderma, is a rare but serious skin disorder that family physicians need to be able to recognize and treat appropriately. Although the etiology is often unknown, exfoliative dermatitis may be the result of a drug reaction or underlying malignancy. The treatment approach should include discontinuation of any potentially offending medications and a search for any underlying malignancy. One of the most common malignancies associated with exfoliative dermatitis is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which may not manifest for months or even years after the onset of the skin condition. Hospitalization is usually necessary for evaluation and initial treatment. In the hospital, special attention should be paid to maintaining temperature control, replacing lost fluids and electrolytes, and preventing and treating infections. Long-term prognosis is good in patients with drug-induced disease, although the course tends to be relapsing-remitting in idiopathic cases. The prognosis of cases associated with malignancy generally depends on the outcome of the underlying malignancy.",0,0

The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) is a randomized intervention trial to compare the effects of ACE inhibition and conventional therapy on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension; CAPPP was a prospective, randomized, open-label trial with blinded endpoint evaluation. 10,985 patients were enrolled at 536 health centers in Sweden and Finland. Patients aged 25 to 66 years with a measured diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or greater on two occasions were randomly assigned to captopril or conventional antihypertensive treatment (diuretics, beta-blockers). Analysis was by intention to treat. The primary endpoint was a composite of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular deaths; Of 5,492 patients assigned to captopril and 5,493 assigned to conventional therapy, 14 and 13, respectively, were lost to follow-up. Primary endpoint events occurred in 363 patients in the captopril group (11.1 per 1,000 patient-years) and 335 in the conventional therapy group (10.2 per 1,000 patient-years; relative risk 1.05 [CI 95%: 0.90-1.22], p=0-52). Cardiovascular mortality was lower with captopril than with conventional treatment (76 vs 95 events; relative risk 0.77 [0.57-1-04], p=0.092), the rate of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction was similar (162 vs 161), but fatal and non-fatal stroke was more frequent with captopril (189 vs 148; 1.25 [1-01-1-55]. p=0.044); Captopril and conventional treatment did not differ in efficacy in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The difference in stroke risk is likely due to the lower blood pressure levels initially achieved in previously treated patients randomized to conventional therapy.",0,0

We performed time-domain and frequency-domain analyzes of 24-hour Holter electrocardiographic recordings to assess heart rate variability; The 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was similar during the furosemide and azosemide treatment periods, but was significantly higher in the first 2 hours after drug administration during furosemide treatment. Plasma renin activity and hematocrit level increased and high-frequency power significantly decreased 2 hours after administration of furosemide alone. The standard deviation of all normal RR intervals and the root mean square of the successive differences in the RR interval were lower with furosemide than with azosemide (P < 0.05); Furosemide, a short-acting loop diuretic, has a greater influence on heart rate variability and fluid balance than azosemide, a long-acting loop diuretic, in patients with mild to moderate chronic congestive heart failure. .",0,0

We previously reported that antihypertensive treatment with the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine reduced the risk of cardiovascular events. In this post hoc analysis, we compared the outcome of nitrendipine treatment in diabetic and non-diabetic patients; After stratification by center, gender, and presence or absence of prior cardiovascular complications, 4,695 patients (age, ≥ 60 years) with systolic blood pressure 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mm Hg were randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg per day) with the possible addition or substitution of enalapril (5 to 20 mg per day) or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg per day), or both, titrated to lower blood pressure. systolic blood pressure at least 20 mm Hg and less than 150 mm Hg.

Subjects (n = 541) with a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 95-114 mmHg were titrated to achieve a diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mmHg. The studies included 114 blacks and 427 non-blacks. The results of an intention-to-treat analysis of mean change from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment showed the following: 1) all three active drugs significantly lowered blood pressure compared to baseline or placebo; 2) in blacks, bisoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg resulted in significantly greater reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than enalapril or placebo, but was not significantly different from amlodipine; 3) in non-blacks, bisoprolol/HCTZ 6.25 mg resulted in a significantly greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure than amlodipine, enalapril, or placebo. The placebo-corrected change in blood pressure was greater for blacks than for whites with the bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ combination, but this was not statistically significant. Bisoprolol/HCTZ 6.25 mg controlled diastolic blood pressure to < or = 90 mmHg in significantly more patients than enalapril or placebo in blacks and non-blacks. The difference in control rates was not significant versus amlodipine.

13,10066961,Linear IgA bullous dermatosis in a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia: possible involvement of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.,,"Kano, Y; Kokaji, T; Shiohara, T","We describe a case of linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) in a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia during treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). After a drug eruption due to imipenem cilastatin sodium disappeared, blistering lesions appeared on the trunk. The results of histopathological and direct immunofluorescence studies of the lesion were consistent with LABD. However, replacement of G-CSF after resolution did not reproduce the bullous eruptions. This suggests that, in addition to G-CSF, the presence of precipitating factors that can synergistically enhance or accelerate the outbreak of the disease is required for the development of bullous lesions. Several cytokines, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), produced endogenously from activated lymphocytes during drug eruption, might have provided a favorable environment for the development of LABD induced by G-CSF. We suggest that patients with LABD will need special attention regarding the type of cytokines or combination of cytokines administered as therapeutic modalities.",0,0

Adjusted mean changes from baseline in supine diastolic blood pressure at trough were -12.8 mmHg for telmisartan and -11.4 mmHg for enalapril (P = 0.074). Mean changes in supine systolic blood pressure were -22.1 mmHg for telmisartan and -20.1 mmHg for enalapril (P = 0.350). Overall, 63% and 62% of patients responded to telmisartan and enalapril, respectively, with supine diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg. Both regimens provided effective blood pressure reduction over the 24-h dosing interval, as determined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Both regimens were well tolerated; however, patients receiving the enalapril regimen had more than twice the incidence of treatment-related cough compared to those receiving the telmisartan regimen (16% vs. 6.5%); These results demonstrate that telmisartan is well tolerated and is at least as effective as enalapril in the treatment of elderly patients with mild to moderate hypertension.",0,0

We conducted a double-blind trial in 25 patients with exercise-induced ischemia. The effects of perindoprilat on pacemaker-induced myocardial ischemia were examined. Fourteen patients received perindoprilat and 11 patients received placebo. Based on LV function, 2 subgroups were formed in the perindoprilat group: 7 patients with LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction <0.40) and 7 patients with normal LV function. After receiving study medication, the stimulation test was repeated. During the first pacemaker test both groups developed ischemia. After perindoprilat administration, the increase in systemic vascular resistance and LV end-diastolic pressure were significantly attenuated (p < 0.05). In addition, perindoprilat inhibited the ischemia-induced increase in arterial and cardiac norepinephrine uptake, and the increase in atrial natriuretic peptide was less pronounced; furthermore, ST-segment depression was reduced by 32% compared to placebo (all p < 0.05). In the group with LV dysfunction, perindoprilat significantly reduced LV end-diastolic pressure by 67% and prevented myocardial lactate production, but this was not the case in the group with normal LV function. Furthermore, the increase in arterial norepinephrine was reduced by 74% and 33%, respectively (p < 0.05). These results indicate that perindoprilat reduced pacemaker-induced acute ischemia in normotensive patients. In patients with (asymptomatic) LV dysfunction, these effects were more pronounced than in patients with normal LV function.",0,0
17,10073748,Cough and Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists: Cause or Confusion?,,"Mackay, F J; Pearce, G L; Mann, R D","Cough is one of the most common side effects associated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, but is not believed to be associated with losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB). This study compares reports of cough with losartan and three ACEIs used in general practice; Studies have been carried out for losartan, and three ACE inhibitors enalapril, lisinopril and perindopril, using the Prescription-Event Monitoring technique. Patients were identified using dispensed prescription data. Questionnaires were sent to the patients' general practitioners 6 months after the date of the first prescription. Cases of cough within the first 60 days of losartan treatment that led to drug withdrawal were followed up with additional questionnaires. Reported incidence rates of cough were calculated. In order to reduce the impact of carryover effects, rate ratios were calculated for first reports of cough between days 8 and 60 using losartan as the index drug; The cohort for each drug exceeded 9000 patients. The distributions by age and sex and the prescription indications of the four drugs were similar. Cough was the most common reason for discontinuation of losartan and the most frequently reported event in the first month of treatment with this drug. When reports of cough between days 1 and 7 were excluded, cough rates were significantly higher for all three ACEIs compared with losartan (rate ratios 1.5, 4.8, and 5.7, all P < 0 .03). 101 patients had discontinued losartan due to cough. Ninety-one percent of these had previously been prescribed an ACE inhibitor and 86% had previously experienced cough with an ACE inhibitor; Carryover represented the observed excess of reports of cough with losartan. Cough rates between days 8 and 60 were significantly higher for all three ACE inhibitors compared with losartan.

Whether they also provide benefit to patients with coronary artery disease in the absence of congestive heart failure through an antiatherosclerotic mechanism is a question that the Quinapril Ischemic Event Trial Quantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA) study attempted to answer: 1,750 patients with normal left ventricular function who undergoing coronary angiography and angioplasty were randomized to quinapril 20 mg/day versus placebo and followed for 3 years for cardiac endpoints. A randomly selected subgroup of the total cohort underwent follow-up angiography. The primary QCA endpoint was the categorical designation of progression versus non-progression, defined by QCA or by a cardiac event in patients selected for the QCA trial who did not have a usable follow-up radiograph. Secondary endpoints in patients with 2 angiograms were: development of new stenosis, change in minimum lumen diameter index, and change in percent diameter stenosis index.

19,10073846,Comparison of the effects of losartan and captopril on mortality in patients after acute myocardial infarction: the OPTIMAAL trial design. Optimal therapy in myocardial infarction with the angiotensin II antagonist Losartan.,,"Dickstein, K; Kjekshus, J","Patients with acute myocardial infarction and evidence of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction during the acute phase are at excess mortality risk. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy attenuates the deleterious effects of angiotensin II and has been shown to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality in this population. Selective angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonism with losartan, which inhibits the effects of angiotensin II regardless of its source at the receptor level, may provide more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. The Optimal Therapy in Myocardial Infarction with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (OPTIMAAL) study is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel, captopril-controlled trial. The main hypothesis is that, compared to captopril, losartan will reduce the risk of all-cause mortality by 20% in high-risk patients after acute myocardial infarction. The study population will consist of 5,000 patients, > or = 50 years of age, with heart failure in the acute phase or with a new anterior infarction with Q wave or reinfarction. Patients will be randomized to receive treatment with losartan or captopril. All patients will be followed until 937 deaths (event-based) occur. The primary endpoint is total mortality (all-cause mortality). Secondary and tertiary endpoints are sudden death (and/or resuscitated cardiac death) and fatal/non-fatal reinfarction. Based on assumed event rate, treatment effect, and 95% power to detect a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality at the 4.3% significance level (2-sided, adjusted for 2 interim analyses) , the trial will recruit at least 5004 patients and continue until reaching a total number of 937 events (intention-to-treat analysis).",1,0
20,10075143,Study on propionyl-L-carnitine in chronic heart failure.,,,"In patients with chronic heart failure, fatigue is independent of hemodynamic and neuroendocrine changes and is possibly due to impaired muscle metabolism. Previous studies have shown that propionyl-L-carnitine, a carnitine derivative, improves muscle metabolism. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of propionyl-L-carnitine on exercise capacity in patients with mild-to-moderate chronic heart failure, treated with ACE inhibitors and diuretics.; This was a phase III, double-blind, randomized, parallel, multicenter study. The primary objective was to assess the effect of propionyl-L-carnitine versus placebo on maximal exercise duration using a bicycle exercise test. The primary analysis performed in the intention-to-treat population (271 and 266 patients on propionyl-L-carnitine and placebo) showed no statistically significant differences between treatments. A difference of 15 s in favor of propionyl-L-carnitine was observed in the completer/complier population (P = 0.092). An a priori specified subgroup analysis in patients stratified by maximal baseline exercise duration showed a trend of improvement in propionyl-L-carnitine patients with shorter maximal exercise duration. An a priori unspecified analysis in patients stratified by ejection fraction (< or = 30% vs 30-40%), showed a statistically significant difference in maximal exercise duration in favor of propionyl-L-carnitine in those patients with a higher ejection fraction (40 s, P<0.01). There were no security issues.; The study does not meet the main objective, but confirms the good safety profile of propionyl-L-carnitine. A non-prespecified exploratory analysis suggests that propionyl-L-carnitine improves exercise capacity in patients with preserved cardiac function. This hypothesis must be confirmed by a specific tailored study.",0,0

Bcl-2 concentrations were higher in hypertensive subjects than in normotensive subjects. Pressure increase due to a cold pressure test caused a further increase in blood bcl-2 concentrations in both hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Treatment of hypertensive patients with hypotensive drugs caused a reduction in bcl-2 concentrations, which was more marked after administration of lisinopril than nifedipine. The results suggest that bcl-2 concentrations are increased in patients with hypertension, which could be an important factor in the cell proliferation underlying posthypertensive vascular remodeling. Furthermore, lisinopril and nifedipine appear to be able to reduce bcl-2 concentrations, with potentially beneficial effects on vascular changes in patients with hypertension.",0,0
22,10077374,Tolerance to ACE inhibitors after cardiac surgery.,,"ManchÃ©, A; Galea, J; Busuttil, W","Several studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors confer significant benefits on mortality and morbidity in heart failure. Hypotension from the first dose may require discontinuation of such therapy. This is more likely to happen if the ACE inhibitor is given soon after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The objective of this study was to analyze the hemodynamic tolerance to early postoperative treatment with perindopril and enalapril in patients with renal and ventricular failure; Eighty-one consecutive CABG patients with a prior myocardial infarction, impaired preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on ventriculography, and moderately impaired renal function (serum creatinine 115-150 micromol/L) were randomized into three groups for receive oral placebo, perindopril (4 mg), or enalapril (5 mg) once daily. Groups were subdivided into those with mild ventricular dysfunction (LVEF = 35-65%, n = 20) and significant ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 35%, n = 7). Exclusion criteria included oliguria (<0.5 mL/kg per hour) or inotrope dependence at the point of entry on the first postoperative day. ACE inhibitor intolerance was defined as hypotension (systolic blood pressure <95 mmHg or greater than 25 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure) causing oliguria (<0.5 mL/kg per hour) unresponsive to intravenous furosemide (20 mg). In such cases, ACE inhibitor therapy was discontinued and patients were started on dopamine; In the groups with mild ventricular dysfunction (LVEF = 35-65%), perindopril was discontinued in 1/20 and enalapril in 4/20 patients (p = ns). However, in the groups with significant ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 35%), perindopril was discontinued in 2/7 and enalapril in 7/7 patients (p = 0.02); Our results suggest that after CABG, patients with moderate renal insufficiency and significant ventricular dysfunction do not tolerate ACE inhibitors well when they are started on the first postoperative day. However, perindopril was associated with less haemodynamic deterioration than enalapril and may therefore be advantageous in this setting. All rights reserved.",0,0

If patients had not responded after four weeks, cilazapril was increased to 2.5 mg daily and captopril to 50 mg three times daily. Quality of life was assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), the Mahler Dyspnea-Fatigue Index, and a health status index (HSI); The physical dimension of the SIP averaged 7 units at baseline and improved after 12 weeks by 2.24 units in the cilazapril group, 2.38 units in the captopril group, and 1.51 units in the placebo group. Therefore, the difference between drug and placebo was 0.73 units (95% CI -0.86 to 2.32) for cilazapril and 0.87 units (95% CI -0, 96 to 2.70) for captopril, with small non-significant effect sizes (a statistical method of estimating the importance of a treatment-related change) of 0.12 and 0.14. Similar results were seen for POMS and HSI total scores. Although quality of life improved more with ACE inhibitors than with placebo, the effect sizes were not significant (< or = 0.26); Improvements in quality of life in mild to moderate heart failure were small when treated with cilazapril or captopril compared with placebo.",1,0

Cardiac evaluation of TRAndolapril.,,"KjÃ¸ller, E; KÃ¸ber, L; JÃ¸rgensen, S; Torp-Pedersen, C","The long-term prognostic significance of hyperkinesis after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is unknown. The American Society of Echocardiography recommends that hyperkinesis not be included in the calculation of the wall motion index (WMI). The aim of the present study was to determine whether hyperkinesia should be included in the WMI when estimated for prognostic purposes after AMI. Six thousand six hundred and seventy-six consecutive patients were examined 1 to 6 days after AMI in 27 Danish hospitals. WMI was measured in 6232 patients using the 9-segment model and the following scoring system: 3 for hyperkinesia, 2 for normokinesia, 1 for hypokinesia, 0 for akinesia, and -1 for dyskinesia. All patients were followed for mortality for at least 3 years. The WMI was calculated in 2 different ways: 1 including hyperkinetic segments (hyperkinetic-WMI) and the other excluding non-hyperkinetic segments (nonhyperkinetic-WMI) by converting hyperkinetic segments to normokinetic segments. Hyperkinesis occurred in 736 patients (11.8%). WMI was an important prognostic factor (relative risk 2.49; p = 0.0001) for long-term mortality along with heart failure, history of hypertension, angina, or diabetes, prior MI, age, thrombolytic therapy, arrhythmias, and heart block. branch. In a multivariate analysis that included nonhyperkinetic WMI, hyperkinesia was associated with a relative risk of 0.84, which was statistically significant (confidence intervals 0.74 to 0.96, P = 0.01). When hyperkinesia was included, both in WMI (hyperkinetic-WMI) and as an independent variable, no additional prognostic information was obtained (relative risk 0.93, p = 0.26). An echocardiographic evaluation soon after AMI provided important prognostic information, especially if information on hyperkinesia was included. If WMI is used for prognostic purposes, hyperkinesia should be included in the index calculation.",0,0

However, the effect on MSC as a mechanism has not been clarified; Trials of ACE inhibitor therapy after MI reported between January 1978 and August 1997 were identified. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: 1) randomized comparison of ACE inhibitor with placebo within 14 days after the MI; 2) study duration/blinded follow-up of > or = 6 weeks; 3) the number of deaths and modes of death were reported or could be obtained from the investigators; We identified 374 candidate articles, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. The 15 trials included 15,104 patients, 2,356 of whom died. Most of the deaths (87%) were cardiovascular and 900 were SCD. A significant reduction in the risk of SCD or a trend towards it was seen in all of the larger trials (N > 500). Overall, ACE inhibitor therapy produced significant reductions in the risk of death (random-effects odds ratio [OR] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-0.97) , cardiovascular death (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.69-0.97) and SCD (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.92); This analysis is consistent with previous reports showing that ACE inhibitors reduce the risk of death after recent MI by reducing cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, this analysis suggests that a reduction in SCD risk with ACE inhibitors is an important component of this survival benefit.",1,1
27,10082500,ACE inhibitor versus beta-blocker for the treatment of hypertension in renal allograft recipients.,,"Hausberg, M; Barenbrock, M; Hohage, H; MÃ¼ller, S; Heidenreich, S; Rahn, K H","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to slow the progression of chronic renal failure. However, the value of ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension in renal allograft recipients has not been established. ACE inhibitors dilate the efferent glomerular arteriole, an effect that may aggravate the decrease in glomerular filtration rate resulting from cyclosporine-induced vasoconstriction in the afferent glomerular arteriole. Therefore, the aim of this randomized, double-blind study was to compare the antihypertensive and renal effects of the ACE inhibitor quinapril with those of the beta-blocker atenolol in renal allograft recipients in whom hypertension developed 6 to 12 weeks after transplantation. All patients received cyclosporine as an immunosuppressant and had stable graft function (serum creatinine concentration, <220 micromol/L) at study entry. Twenty-nine patients receiving quinapril (daily dose titrated between 2.5 and 20 mg) and 30 patients receiving atenolol (daily dose titrated between 12.5 and 100 mg) completed the 24-month study. The two groups did not differ in age, sex ratio, height, and weight before entering the study. Quinapril lowered diastolic blood pressure from 96+/-1 to 84+/-1 mm Hg (average over the entire treatment period) and atenolol lowered diastolic blood pressure from 96+/-1 to 83+/-1 mm Hg . Serum creatinine concentration did not change significantly in either group after 24 months (129+/-8 micromol/L at baseline and 148+/-19 micromol/L after 24 months in the quinapril group and 131+/- -6 micromol/L at admission and 152+/-15 micromol/L after 24 months in the atenolol group; P=NS for both groups). After 24 months, the change in urinary albumin excretion from baseline was -10+/-15 mg/d in the quinapril group and 52+/-32 mg/d in the atenolol group (P=0. 03). These results show that quinapril and atenolol are effective antihypertensive drugs when used after renal transplantation. Furthermore, compared to atenolol, quinapril has no adverse effects on graft function. The relative reduction in albuminuria observed with quinapril compared to atenolol might indicate a beneficial effect of quinapril on long-term graft function.",0,0

Results of the RIMA study (Rimodellamento Infarto Miocardico Acuto). RIMA researchers.,,"Coletta, C; Ricci, R; Ceci, V; Seccareccia, F; Rulli, F; Mazzuca, V; Putini, R L; Salustri, A; Bottero, G; Pasquale, M","The RIMA (Rimodellamento Infarto Miocardico Acuto) study was designed to assess the relative effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by captopril, beta-blocker therapy by metoprolol, and their combination in patients with a first acute myocardial infarction in: 1. echocardiographically detected left ventricular remodeling; 2. prognosis. The second objective will be the argument of this work. Two hundred and fifty < or = 75 years of consecutive patients (mean age: 58 years, men = 203) with acute myocardial infarction were randomly assigned to receive for > or = 3 months captopril (up to 75 mg/day, Group 1), metoprolol (up to 200 mg/day, Group 2) or captopril + metoprolol (Group 3) from the first 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Intravenous beta-blockers in the acute phase of myocardial infarction and all other cardioactive drugs were allowed. The effect of randomized therapy at six months after admission to the coronary care unit was considered in relation to: 1. recurrence of spontaneous cardiac events and elective revascularization procedures; 2. adverse reactions (hypotension, atrioventricular block, cough, allergy, need for beta-blockers in Group 1, need for ACE inhibitors in Group 2) requiring treatment modification based on physician decision; Definitive follow-up data was available on 226 patients and 195/226 patients (86%) had a full treatment period. In these patients (by protocol analysis), 37 spontaneous cardiac events occurred: cardiac death = 6, nonfatal reinfarction = 9, unstable angina requiring hospitalization = 16, congestive heart failure = 6. In addition, seven patients received a revascularization procedure coronary. Events occurred in 11/67 patients in Group 1, 16/63 patients in Group 2, 10/65 patients in Group 3 (16% vs 25% vs 15%, p = 0.28). Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated an increased odds ratio (OR) for spontaneous cardiac events in Group 2 patients (OR = 2.82, 95% CI: 1.16-6.87: p < 0 .05). Elective revascularization procedures were statistically less frequent in patients treated with metoprolol (Group 1 = 9%, Group 2 = 1.6%, Group 3 = 0%; Group 1 vs Groups 2 and 3; p = 0.03). The intention-to-treat analysis of the total population (226 patients) confirmed the presence of a trend towards higher risk in Group 2 patients (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 0.96-4.59; p = 0.06). Adverse reactions were observed in 16 patients in Group 1, 6 patients in Group 2 and 15 patients in Group 3 (22% vs 10% vs 23%; Group 2 vs Groups 1 and 3; p = 0.08). In multivariable regression analysis, a trend toward fewer adverse reactions was confirmed in patients assigned to beta-blocker therapy alone (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.15-1.13, p = 0.07) ; In an early post-infarction randomized treatment strategy, ACE inhibition with captopril alone or in combination with metoprolol demonstrated greater protection against spontaneous cardiac events at six months compared with metoprolol alone. On the other hand, beta-blocker therapy was associated with fewer elective revascularization procedures and seemed better tolerated than ACE inhibition.",1,0

The causes of heart failure were old myocardial infarction (n = 7), hypertension (n = 2), and atrial fibrillation (n = 1). Radioiodinated metaiodobenzyl guanidine (123I-MIBG) imaging, radionuclide angiography, and treadmill exercise testing were performed before and after treatment. With enalapril treatment, (1) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased significantly from 38.3 +/- 6.9% to 47.5 +/- 14.7%; (2) submaximal exercise time increased significantly from 205 +/- 112 to 272 +/- 120 seconds; (3) 123I-MIBG heart/mediastinum (H/M) ratio was significantly increased (early image: 1.99 +/- 0.38 vs. 2.20 +/- 0.50; late image: 1.86 +/- 0.44 vs. 2.09 +/- 0.51) ; and (4) the washout rate of 123I-MIBG decreased slightly from 29.1 +/- 9.1% to 25.4 +/- 7.0%. LVEF improvement rate was significantly correlated with H/M ratio improvement rates and washout rate after enalapril treatment. Therefore, the long-term effects of enalapril can be observed on the cardiac sympathetic nervous system, and 123I-MIBG imaging appears to be useful in evaluating the therapeutic effects of enalapril on the cardiac sympathetic nervous system in patients with chronic heart failure. .",0,0

The goal of treatment was a sitting DBP < 95 mm Hg by the ninth week of treatment. This was followed by a 4-month open-label phase using nisoldipine CC 10 to 60 mg daily. Ninety-six patients had complete data at baseline and at the end of the double-blind and open-label phases and were included in this analysis. In both groups, all patients required titration to the maximum dose of double-blind medication. Monotherapy with nisoldipine CC, but not with enalapril, significantly reduced both sitting and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) over 24 hours. BP at 24 hours in the nisoldipine CC group decreased from 179+/-14/118+/-7 to 144+/-16/94+/-10 mm Hg (p < 0.0001) versus 181+/ -13/117+/-5 to 171+/-17/110+/-11 mm Hg in the enalapril group (P = ns). The profound reduction in blood pressure achieved with nisoldipine CC was accompanied by a significant reduction in left ventricular [LV] mass index, observed after only 2 months of treatment (from 146+/-40 to 129+/-35 g /m2, P = .05). In contrast, enalapril had no effect on LV mass (139+/-36 to 142+/-50 g/m2, P = NS). The antihypertensive effect of nisoldipine CC was further demonstrated in the open-label phase, during which 24-hour BP decreased from 180+/-14/118+/-6 mm Hg (at baseline) to 142+/-16/ 92+/- 10 mm Hg at the end of the 16-week open-label phase (p < 0.0001). This effect was maintained with a minimum-maximum ratio of 74% for systolic BP and 67% for diastolic BP, with a greater regression in LV mass. Reduction in 24-h systolic BP < 135 mm Hg was associated with a greater degree of LV mass index regression in patients treated with nisoldipine CC. The incidence of adverse events in both groups was low and both nisoldipine CC and enalapril were well tolerated. The incidence of significant ventricular arrhythmia was also low and did not change with treatment. In conclusion, our findings suggest that once-daily nisoldipine CC might be considered an appropriate first-line antihypertensive agent in black patients with severe hypertension, based on its profound and sustained blood pressure lowering effect associated with significant regression of left ventricular arterial pressure. mass and its low profile of side effects.",0,0

Recently, ACE-I has been found to decrease plasma levels of circulating vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (cVCAM-1) in patients with congestive heart failure. Since elevated levels of cVCAM-1 are pathognomonic for diabetics with microangiopathy, we investigated the effects of ACE-I on plasma levels of cVCAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (cICAM-1), and cE-selectin in microalbuminuric diabetics. In addition, the effects of ACE-I on plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) were studied. Fosinopril (10 mg/day) was administered for 12 weeks to 11 microalbuminuric patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). As expected, baseline plasma concentrations of cE-selectin, cICAM-1, and cVCAM-1 were markedly higher in patients than in healthy controls (n = 82, P < 0.001). PAI-1 levels in NIDDM were similar to control subjects, while TPA levels were approximately 25% lower in patients than control subjects (p = 0.013). Serum cVCAM-1 levels decreased by -19% (CI: -25% to -13%) after fosinopril treatment (p=0.003) and were no longer different from the control group. In contrast, plasma levels of cE-selectin, cICAM-1, PAI-1 and TPA were not affected. As expected, microalbuminuria decreased by -44% (CI -65 to -22, P=0.004). In conclusion, fosinopril reduced cVCAM-1 levels along with microalbuminuria in NIDDM. This may represent a new mechanism of action of ACE-I in diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction. Whether the decreased expression of VCAM-1 is responsible for the observed reduction in microalbuminuria warrants further investigation.",0,0

Furthermore, the effect of using beta-blockers, in addition to an ACE inhibitor, in these patients has not been fully addressed.; This retrospective analysis evaluated the association of initial beta-blocker use with mortality in 4223 mostly asymptomatic prevention trial patients and 2567 symptomatic treatment trial patients.; The 1,015 (24%) patients in the Prevention trial and 197 (8%) patients in the Treatment trial who received beta-blockers had fewer symptoms, higher ejection fractions, and different medication use than patients who did not receive beta-blockers. On univariate analysis, beta-blocker use was associated with significantly lower mortality than no use in both trials. In addition, the prevention trial suggested a synergistic reduction in mortality with the use of a beta-blocker and enalapril. After adjusting for important prognostic variables with Cox multivariate analysis, the association of beta-adrenergic blocking agent use with reduced mortality remained significant for prevention trial patients who received enalapril. Lower rates of arrhythmic and pump failure death and risk of death or hospitalization for heart failure were observed; The combination of a beta-blocker and enalapril was associated with a synergistic reduction in the risk of death in the SOLVD Prevention trial.",0,0

Higher pulse pressure was associated with a higher prevalence of female sex, greater use of calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and diuretics, lower heart rate, and a higher rate of reported smoking history. Higher mean arterial pressure was associated with higher heart rate, lower use of calcium channel blockers and digoxin, and lower New York Heart Association functional class. During a 61-month follow-up, there were 1,582 deaths (1,397 cardiovascular). In a multivariate analysis adjusting for the above covariates and treatment assignment, higher pulse pressure remained an independent predictor of total and cardiovascular mortality (relative risk of total mortality, 1.05 per 10-mm Hg increment; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.10, p = 0.02). Mean arterial pressure was inversely related to total and cardiovascular mortality (relative risk for total mortality, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.85 to 0.94; P < 0.0001); A noninvasive measurement of blood pressure provides two independent prognostic factors for survival. Increased ductal vessel stiffness, as assessed by pulse pressure, may contribute to increased mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, regardless of mean arterial pressure.",0,0

Between 1991 and 1996, eight consecutive patients (6 men, 2 women) aged 27 to 73 years (mean 49.8 years) with known chronic renal failure and a solitary kidney referred for RCT treatment were included. Renography with 99Tcm-DTPA was performed at baseline and 1 hour after administration of 25 mg captopril one week apart. CRT was performed according to the criteria of the Working Group on Diagnostic Criteria for Renovascular Hypertension with Captopril Renography. A beneficial or detrimental effect of subsequent ACE inhibitor treatment on renal function was determined by long-term follow-up (> or = 2 years). CRT accurately predicted outcome in all eight patients subsequently treated with ACE inhibitors.

39,10093769,Heart failure.,,"Rich, M W","Heart failure is predominantly a disorder of older adults, and to a large extent, the epidemiology of heart failure reflects the convergence of age-related changes in the cardiovascular system and the increasing prevalence of age-related cardiovascular disease. The diagnosis of heart failure in the elderly is often difficult due to the presence of atypical symptoms and comorbid conditions. Similarly, optimal treatment often poses a therapeutic challenge due to the high prevalence of confounding medical, behavioral, psychosocial, and economic factors. In addition, there is a paucity of data on the pharmacotherapy of heart failure in the very elderly (over 80 years of age) and in the large proportion of older patients with heart failure and preserved left ventricular systolic function. Despite these difficulties, several therapeutic options, including ACE inhibitors, digoxin, and possibly beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor antagonists, have been shown to favorably affect the clinical course of heart failure in elderly patients. advanced. In addition, several studies have documented the efficacy of multidisciplinary heart failure disease management programs in reducing hospital admission rates, improving quality of life, and lowering the cost of care. Currently, the three greatest challenges in the management of older patients with heart failure are: (1) to more effectively implement proven treatments, such as ACE inhibitors, disease management systems, and antihypertensive therapy; (2) develop effective therapies for the treatment of diastolic heart failure; and (3) develop more effective means of preventing heart failure. Future studies are expected to address each of these critically important topics.",0,0

This study was designed to assess the behavior of physicians in general practice in treating patients with poorly controlled essential hypertension using self-measurement. Patients, most of whom were already taking antihypertensive medications, were started on perindopril or indapamide at their physician's discretion and were randomly assigned to self-measurement (SM) using an OMRON HEM706 oscillometric device or to continuation of their usual care (UC). during an 8-week period. This was an observational study with no specific or stated treatment goal for the physician to follow. Sixty of 62 subjects completed the study, and the two groups were equally matched for age, body mass index, gender, and blood pressure (BP). While additional perindopril or indapamide produced a significant drop in BP in both groups during the study period, systolic pressure remained significantly higher in the SM group (sitting 148 +/- 3 compared to 142 +/- 3; 145 +/- 3 compared with 138 +/- 3 mm Hg respectively, P < 0.05). Twenty-four-hour and daytime ambulatory monitor systolic pressures were also significantly higher in the SM group. The differences in diastolic BP were not statistically significant. In addition, MS patients were less likely to have their medications increased and more likely to have them reduced or discontinued. Physicians and patients found self-monitoring convenient and useful. This study suggests that physicians' prescribing decisions are influenced by evidence of self-monitoring of BP with consequent increases in office BP related to reduced drug use. Although self-monitoring of BP can offer reassurance about the adequacy of control when away from a doctor's office, our best evidence for understanding target blood pressures comes from large randomized studies using office blood pressures as the endpoint. assessment.

Minimum:maximum ratios were calculated by two different methods (global and individualized approaches) from 24-h ambulatory blood pressure recordings made after the placebo period and after the active treatment period. Residual blood pressure reduction after a single single-blind dose omission with additional 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was also investigated. Safety evaluations were performed throughout the study.; The minimum:maximum ratio of placebo-adjusted global diastolic blood pressure was 0.80 in the amlodipine group (n = 47) and 0.81 in the perindopril group (n = 49) in an intention analysis. try. The corresponding trough:peak overall systolic blood pressure ratio was 0.83 for amlodipine and 0.68 for perindopril. Individual trough:peak ratios were not normally distributed. The mean (+/- SD) individual trough: peak ratio (intention-to-treat analysis) for diatolic blood pressure was 0.50 +/- 0.69 for amlodipine (median 0.42) and 0.15 +/- - 3.27 for perindopril (median 0.33). In the per protocol analysis, the corresponding values were 0.50 +/- 0.72 (median 0.34) for amlodipine and 0.01 +/- 3.90 for perindopril (median 0.21). Both treatments produced comparable decreases in clinical systolic and diastolic blood pressure between days 0 and 60. Forty-eight hours after the last dose, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were lower in patients treated with amlodipine than in those treated with amlodipine. patients treated with perindopril. Amlodipine and perindopril were generally well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse event was leg edema in amlodipine-treated patients (19.1%) and cough in perindopril-treated patients (14.3%); These results showed no statistically significant differences in trough:peak ratios between amlodipine and perindopril. However, the minimum:maximum ratios of ambulatory blood pressure showed very large variations. Determination of trough:peak ratios using the conventional approach or using an individual approach can give disparate values. After missing a dose, a condition that mimics nonadherence, blood pressure was controlled more effectively with amlodipine than with perindopril.",0,0

53,10150320,Effect of acute and long-term administration of ramipril on the circadian rhythm of blood pressure in essential hypertension.,,"Cavazzini, D; Amadei, G; Manfredini, R; Musacci, G; Mele, D; Longhini, C","Ambulatory monitoring was used to assess the antihypertensive efficacy and effect on circadian rhythms of blood pressure and heart rate of single-dose and long-term administration of ramipril in 20 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Initially, patients were randomized to receive placebo or a single dose of ramipril 5 mg, followed one week later by ramipril 5 mg daily for 6 months. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and heart rate were measured every 20 minutes for 24 hours. Single-dose ramipril reduced both SBP and DBP (p < 0.001) without affecting heart rate. Long-term treatment produced a small additional antihypertensive effect, again without changing heart rate. Cosinor's analysis showed that both administrations of ramipril effectively reduced SBP and DBP measurements (p < 0.001), compared to placebo; circadian rhythms remained intact. Heart rate also did not change in any circadian parameter. However, there was a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in blood pressure amplitude after long-term treatment and may be of importance in terms of prevention of heart damage.",0,0

Because the genesis of LVH appears to be multifactorial, antihypertensive treatment should aim to reduce not only pressor values but also hypertrophic ventricular mass. This result can only be obtained when drugs capable of acting on both pathogenic factors are used. To assess the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy in regressing LVH, 21 patients with stage 2 essential hypertension were treated for one year with atenolol (120 mg/d orally), a cardioselective beta-blocker with no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, or ramipril ( 5 mg/d orally), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with high tissue activity. Both treatments produced significant control of hypertension and regression of LVH. No statistically significant differences were observed between treatments, with the exception of heart rate, which did not change substantially with ramipril but decreased significantly with atenolol. Both drugs were well tolerated. Atenolol and ramipril have an important role in the long-term treatment of hypertension and in the regression of LVH associated with hypertension.",0,0
55,10155301,Quality of life measures for patients taking which medications? The clinical perspective of the PCASEE.,,"Bech, P","Of the many publications on quality of life in medicine during the last 2 decades, only a small fraction has been devoted to drug trials. The most frequently investigated are drug classes within cancer disorders, hypertension, and depressive illness. Health-related quality of life (QOL) measurements are typically applied in chronic or subchronic disorders where patients assess the balance between efficacy (disease-modifying drug effects) and safety (adverse drug reactions) in terms of subjective well-being. . In this context, quality of life is an attempt to help the doctor to listen to his patient. The components of the QOL measurements are found within the PCASEE model where: P = physical indicators; C = cognitive indicators; A = affective indicators; S = social indicators; E = socio-economic stressors or negative life events; and E = ego function or personality problems. Most of the variation in quality of life measures arises from operating on cognitive (eg, lack of control, concentration difficulties) or affective (eg, depressed mood or anxiety) components. . The more specific component is, of course, adverse drug reactions, which are typically gastrointestinal symptoms with cancer therapies, and circulatory symptoms and sexual function with antihypertensive drugs. However, the affective and cognitive components also have different weight within the drug subclasses, such as antihypertensives. Thus, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors act on the affective component (depression and anxiety) and calcium channel blockers on the cognitive component (neurasthenia). In general, patients with cancer or hypertension provide more reliable assessments of their cognitive and affective symptoms than their physicians, while patients with primary depression are less reliable than their physicians or relatives in measuring changes in the affective components of their illness when they are sick. . Health-related quality of life measurements not only have an impact on the doctor-patient relationship, but also imply a holistic approach to pharmacological treatment, checking all components of the PCASEE.",0,0
56,10164060,Formulary management of ACE inhibitors.,,"Gerbrandt, K R; Yedinak, K C","An increasing number of ACE inhibitors have become available in recent years. Because these agents are all similar, careful scrutiny is required to determine the specific advantages of particular agents when making formulary decisions. Differences between the agents with respect to tissue structure and specificity have been identified, but the clinical relevance of these differences is unclear. ACE inhibitors vary widely with respect to bioconversion, distribution, and elimination. Disease states such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and liver or kidney failure may affect the disposition of specific ACE inhibitors. These agents can differ substantially in duration of action, and once-daily ACE inhibitors can optimize patient compliance and lower costs. ACE inhibitors have been extensively studied in patients with hypertension, CHF, or kidney disease, and after myocardial infarction (MI). Differences in efficacy between agents are often the result of variations in study design or because non- equipotential doses were compared. The benefits of ACE inhibitors are likely to be class effects, and it is probably reasonable to use an agent even if large-scale clinical trials have not been conducted with that particular drug. Few differences have been found between ACE inhibitors with respect to adverse effects or drug interactions, and these factors are of less importance when making formulary decisions. Cost and availability may vary between agents and will depend on geographic location and institution-specific purchase agreements. ACE inhibitors have shown positive effects on quality of life compared with agents from other classes. Quality of life studies that have directly compared ACE inhibitors have produced conflicting results. In the context of hypertension, cost-effectiveness assessments generally find that the newer, longer-acting ACE inhibitors provide the greatest financial benefit. Differences in cost-effectiveness in the post-MI patient population are often the result of variations in protocol design, including duration of treatment and non-drug costs. ACE inhibitors are fairly homogeneous and selection between agents can be difficult. Clinical efficacy, time course of action, and cost are major concerns when selecting agents for inclusion on a formulary.",0,0
57,10169388,Economic evaluation of ACE inhibitor treatment of nephropathy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in Italy.,,"Garattini, L; Brunetti, M; Salvioni, F; Barosi, M","Diabetic nephropathy is one of the main complications of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), with proteinuria being the main clinical manifestation of diabetic nephropathy. Most patients who develop overt proteinuria progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), usually within 5 to 7 years; ESRD requires dialysis or a kidney transplant. Although a relationship between lowering blood pressure and delaying ESRD has long been assumed, it was only recently that a randomized controlled clinical trial demonstrated that treatment of diabetic nephropathy with an ACE inhibitor can significantly delay blood loss. kidney function and thus ESRD. According to the clinical trial on which this economic evaluation was based, the costs and consequences of 2 alternatives were considered: (i) patients subject to blood pressure control with only antihypertensive medication, but without ACE inhibitors (placebo group) and (ii) patients receiving ACE inhibitor therapy (captopril group) with similar blood pressure control to the placebo group. This cost-benefit analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service [Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (SSN)]. Consequently, only direct costs related to publicly funded health services were included. The number of years of dialysis avoided (DYA) was the clinical endpoint. For the economic evaluation, a time horizon of 10 years was considered. Captopril therapy was dominant, being both more effective and less expensive. The total cost of the captopril alternative over the 10-year period was 21,901,625 Italian Lire (L; 1993 values) per patient, while the total cost of the placebo alternative was 30,352,590 L per patient. Compared to placebo, an estimated 20.01 DYA per 100 patients treated with captopril therapy during the trial period, which is equivalent to 2.4 months per patient. The robustness of this result was confirmed by sensitivity analysis: for both extremes, captopril remained dominant. This economic evaluation, requested by the Italian Ministry of Health, demonstrated savings in health expenditure with the use of an ACE inhibitor in patients with proteinuria.",0,0

Acute infarction Ramipril Efficacy.,,"Erhardt, L; Ball, S; Andersson, F; Bergentoft, P; Martinez, C","We estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding the ACE inhibitor ramipril to conventional treatment in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. These estimates were based on the Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) study and supplemental Swedish healthcare resource use data for a subset of patients. The mean follow-up was 15 months (minimum 6 months, maximum 3.8 years). The perspective of the analysis was that of the county councils (third party payers), and we focused on the cost of medication and hospitalization. The marginal profitability of the treatment was estimated in 3 treatment periods: 1, 2 and 3.8 years. Cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from SEK14,148 to SEK33,033 per life year gained ($US1 = SEK7.70. Pound 1 = SEK12.40) for the 3 treatment periods.

Clinical pharmacists evaluated for ADR at a county hospital in Indianapolis, IN. Patient information was reviewed at admission, every four days during hospitalization, and at discharge. Causation, severity, pharmacological type (ie, augmented pharmacology versus idiosyncratic reaction), and organ system involvement of ADRs occurring after hospital admission were assessed. Nurse and pharmacist reports, incident reports, physician consultations, patient transfers to intensive care units, and serum drug concentration reports were additional means of ADR identification. Overall, 23.1% of patients experienced an ADR, while 2.6% of 11,702 drug exposures resulted in an ADR. Patients older than 65 years (29.6% vs. 20.5% for younger patients) and women (26.2% vs. 20% for men) had a higher risk of developing ADRs (p < 0 .05). Hospital length of stay was longer (13.3 days vs. 6.7 days; p < 0.05) and drug exposures were more frequent for patients who experienced ADRs (p < 0.001). Furosemide caused the most adverse reactions with 36 in 244 patient exposures (14.7%). Diltiazem, enalapril, heparin, trimterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination, and captopril were also frequently implicated. ADRs were classified as mild (35.9%), moderate (52.6%) and severe (10.2%). The most commonly affected organ systems were metabolic/hematologic (32.9%), gastrointestinal (17.8%), genitourinary (11.8%), and cardiovascular (10.5%).

A statistically significant reduction in mortality was achieved at 6 weeks among patients treated with lisinopril compared with patients assigned to the control group (absolute mortality reduction: 7.5 +/- 3.6 lives saved per 1000 treated patients). The comparative cost-effectiveness ratio for the use of lisinopril, expressed as cost per additional survivor among patients randomized to receive lisinopril, was US$2080 per life saved (1993 values). Sensitivity analysis performed to examine the effects of varying the estimated absolute reduction in mortality over its 95% confidence interval, which ranged from 14.6 to 0.4 lives saved per 1,000 patients treated, showed that Consequently, the cost-effectiveness ratios vary between $US1121 and $US.

This study was designed to determine whether selected new dynamic analysis methods of HR variability predict mortality in patients with depressed left ventricular (LV) function after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Traditional indices of heart rate variability in the time and frequency domain together with the short-term fractal-like correlation properties of RR intervals (alpha exponent) and power law scaling (beta exponent) are used. studied 159 patients with depressed LV function (ejection fraction <35%) after AMI. At the end of the 4-year follow-up, 72 patients (45%) had died and 87 (55%) were still alive. The short-term scaling exponent alpha (1.07 +/- 0.26 vs. 0.90 +/- 0.26, p < 0.001) and power law beta slope (-1.35 +/- -0.23 vs -1.44 +/-0.25, p < 0.05) differed between survivors and those who died, but none of the traditional measures of HR variability differed between these groups. Among all the variables analyzed, the reduced scaling exponent alpha (<0.85) was the best univariate predictor of mortality (relative risk 3.17, 95% confidence interval 1.96 to 5.15, p <0.0001), with positive and negative predictive accuracies of the 65% and 86%. , respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, mortality was independently predicted by reduced alpha exponent (p < 0.001) after adjusting for several clinical variables and LV function. A short-term fractal-like scaling exponent was the most powerful heart rate variability index for predicting mortality in patients with depressed LV function.

The purpose of this double-blind, randomized, parallel trial was to assess whether better blood pressure (BP) control can reverse this deterioration. The study group consisted of 33 patients (ages 45 to 63 years) with poor BP control who received random metoprolol or enalapril monotherapy. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was assessed by the phenylephrine test and time- and frequency-domain measurements of heart rate variability (HRV) were analyzed from 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings during monotherapy and after 10 weeks of combination therapy with metoprolol + felodipine or enalaryl + hydrochlorothiazide to lower casual BP to < 140/90 mm Hg. Intensive treatment decreased 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP from 139 +/- 12/86 +/- 8 mm Hg to 126 +/- 8/80 +/- 7 mm Hg (p < 0.0001). BRS improved from 6.2 +/- 3.2 ms/mm Hg to 8.9 +/- 4.1 ms/mm Hg (p < 0.0001), and HRV measurements (eg, SD of all RR intervals from 128 +/- 45 ms to 145 +/- 46 ms, p < 0.001) significantly improved during combination therapy. Changes in BRS and HRV were similar in magnitude in both treatment arms. Mean RR intervals were comparable before and after intensive antihypertensive treatment (850 +/- 124 ms vs. 937 +/- 279 ms, p = NS). These data indicate that adequate BP control with modern antihypertensive combination therapy may improve cardiovascular autonomic function, which may partially explain the reduction in cardiac mortality observed in patients on intensified antihypertensive therapy.",0,0

Whether this is primarily related to drug-specific side effects or primary pathogenic conditions is unknown. In the present study, 101 male patients from our hypertension outpatient clinic answered detailed questionnaires about hypertension and sexual function. Patients with perceived impotence were offered a complete evaluation and examination of the penis by specialists in the urology department. Twenty-seven (27%) men had impotence. The main cause of impotence was arterial dysfunction (89%). The prevalence of impotence was related to the degree of secondary organic manifestation, reflected in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification I-III (p = 0.01). Intermittent claudication (p = 0.001) and ischemic heart disease (p = 0.005) were the best determinants in this regard. Twelve impotent patients (44%) attributed the onset of impotence to drug initiation. A variety of drugs have been implicated in the occurrence of drug-induced impotence. In summary, our results indicate that impotence in hypertensive men is mainly caused by penile arterial vascular changes, probably atherosclerosis.

68,10193712,Recent information on therapy of congestive heart failure: focus on ACE inhibition and angiotensin-II antagonism.,,"Brunner-La Rocca, H P; Vaddadi, G; Esler, M D","One possible intervention to interrupt the deleterious effects of the renin-angiotensin system is the suppression of angiotensin II (Ang II) formation through angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. However, ACE inhibition incompletely suppresses Ang II formation and also leads to bradykinin accumulation. Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors are believed to promote the known deleterious effects of Ang II. Therefore, AT1 receptor antagonists have recently been introduced in therapy for hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF). Although there are significant differences between the effects of AT1 receptor antagonists and ACE inhibitors, including unopposed stimulation of angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptors by AT1 receptor antagonists, discussion of Whether ACE inhibitors, AT1 receptor antagonists, or a combination of the two are superior in the pharmacotherapy of CHF is still largely theoretical. Consequently, AT1 receptor antagonists are still investigational. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors remain the first-line treatment in patients with CHF due to systolic dysfunction. However, in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitor-induced side effects, particularly cough, AT1 receptor antagonism is a good alternative. In clinical practice, emphasis should be placed on increasing the use of ACE inhibitors, since more than 50% of patients with CHF do not receive ACE inhibitors. Also, most of those who take ACE inhibitors receive lower doses than the doses used in large clinical trials. Although not yet fully proven, high doses of ACE inhibitors are likely to be superior to low doses with respect to prognosis and symptoms.",0,0

After the first dose of study medication, patients who received placebo were reassigned to one of the four doses of irbesartan, treatment continued for 12 weeks, and hemodynamic measurements were repeated; Irbesartan induced significant dose-related reductions in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (mean change -5.9+/-0.9 mm Hg and -5.3+/-0.9 mm Hg for irbesartan 75 mg and 150 mg , respectively) after 12 weeks of treatment without causing reflex tachycardia and without increasing plasma norepinephrine. The neurohormonal effects of irbesartan were highly variable and none of the changes were statistically significant. There was a significant dose-related decrease in the percentage of patients who discontinued study medication due to worsening heart failure. Irbesartan was well tolerated with no evidence of dose-related cough or azotemia; Irbesartan, at doses of 75 mg and 150 mg once daily, induced sustained hemodynamic improvement and prevented worsening of heart failure.",0,0

We studied the effect of 6 months of treatment with lisinopril on endothelial function in a group of patients with hypercholesterolemia. Forty patients were studied. Forearm blood flow responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography. Subjects were then randomized in a double-blind manner to receive lisinopril 20 mg/day (n=20) or placebo (n=20) for 6 months. The plethysmography was then repeated. Baseline variables between groups were comparable. In the lisinopril group, blood pressure was significantly reduced [systolic: 145+/-4 to 128+/-4 mmHg (P<0.001); diastolic: 84+/-2 to 74+/-2 mmHg (P<0.001)]. An improvement in vasodilator response (expressed as a ratio of infused/control arm) to acetylcholine was found, for example, 3.33+/-0.3 (pre) versus 4.45+/-0.48 (post). ) at 30 microg/mL (P<0.03), and also nitroprusside, eg, 3.0+/-0.2 (pre) vs. 3.86+/-0.3 (post) at 3 0.2 microg/mL (P<0.01). In the placebo group, vasodilation did not change significantly in response to acetylcholine, and responses to nitroprusside did not change. The data presented suggest that 6 months of treatment with lisinopril has a beneficial effect on arterial function in subjects with hyperlipidemia.

A few randomized trials and many prospective studies address the management of anemia, hyperparathyroidism, and multidisciplinary predialysis care. The benefits of lipid lowering are suggested by randomized trials among patients without kidney disease.; The progression of renal failure, particularly in patients with proteinuria, can be slowed by lowering blood pressure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are more beneficial than other antihypertensives in this situation. Partial correction of anemia with iron, erythropoietin, or androgens can improve quality of life and potentially prevent heart disease. Renal bone disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism can be prevented in part by early restriction of dietary phosphate, use of calcium-containing phosphate binders, and activated vitamin D. Correction of acidosis could improve protein metabolism and bone and cardiovascular health. Treatment of hyperlipidemia could reduce cardiovascular disease. Early involvement of a nephrology-based multidisciplinary team has the potential to reduce morbidity and costs, improve patients' knowledge of their condition, and prolong the period before dialysis is required. The care of patients with progressive renal failure is complex and requires attention to detail. Family physicians play a vital role in these efforts and must be involved in all aspects of care.",0,0

After a 4-week placebo run-in period, they received temocapril 20 mg daily (n = 19) or placebo (n = 11) for 6 weeks. Insulin sensitivity index (SI), determined by the Bergman Minimal Model method, serum lipoproteins, plasma renin activity, fibrinogen, and microalbuminuria were assessed at the end of the placebo run-in phase and double-blind treatment phases. Administration of temocapril, but not placebo, produced a significant decrease in supine BP (152/92+/-5/3 vs. 162/98+/-5/2 mm Hg; p < 0.01) and an increase in plasma renin (p < 0.05). The SI variation during temocapril treatment did not reach statistical significance (0.95+/-0.2 before vs 1.44+/-0.4 x 10(-4)/min/mU/L after treatment ). During administration of temocapril or placebo, no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and serum levels of total triglycerides, cholesterol, lipoprotein cholesterol fractions, or fibrinogen were observed. Microalbuminuria was significantly decreased with temocapril treatment (49+/-10 vs. 79+/-17 mg/24 h; p < 0.01), but not with placebo.

Joint National Committee.,,"Ramsey, S D; Neil, N; Sullivan, S D; Perfetto, E","We wanted to determine the clinical cost of managing hypertension by following the Joint National Committee on Hypertension (JNC) guidelines, including drug therapy, the cost of monitoring and treating side effects, compliance, and the cost of switching after failure. therapeutic; The base case analysis considers antihypertensive agents from four therapeutic classes that were recently evaluated in a large randomized trial: enalapril, amlodipine, acebutolol, and chlorthalidone. Clinical evaluation, therapy, and control of hypertension are modeled with an incidence-based Markov model. Clinical inputs include agent efficacy, side effects, and adherence to dosing schedules. JNC recommended clinical and laboratory monitoring schedules are followed for each agent. Changes between classes occur due to therapeutic failures. Drug and health care costs are valued in 1995 US dollars; Although patients whose hypertension was initially treated with amlodipine achieved control more easily than patients who received the other agents, the initial costs to achieve and maintain hypertension control were lower for chlorthalidone ($641), followed by acebutolol ( $920), amlodipine ($946), and enalapril ($948). Maintenance costs were the lowest for chlorthalidone. For all agents except chlorthalidone, drug costs were the largest component of overall costs, followed by costs for office visits, laboratory monitoring, and switching classes for therapeutic failure; Following the JNC guidelines, a slightly higher percentage of patients will achieve hypertension control with a newer class calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), but at a substantially higher cost than with a generic diuretic (chlorthalidone).",0,0
79,10220238,Did we learn evidence-based medicine in medical school? Some common medical mythology.,,"Paauw, D S","Medical myths occur for many different reasons. A common thread is that they all make some pathophysiological sense. A good example is the concern about the use of oral cobalamin in the treatment of pernicious anemia. Difficulty absorbing vitamin B12 when intrinsic factor is not available does not make oral replacement impossible; the dose just needs to be higher. Pathophysiological concerns have also been a key reason why clinicians have avoided using beta-blockers in patients with diabetes. They fear that beta blockers will block adrenergic symptoms and that patients won't know when they have hypoglycemia. In the studies addressing this issue, there does not seem to be a real problem with the increase in severe episodes of hypoglycemia in patients taking beta-blockers or the increase in unawareness of hypoglycemia. Several studies commented on the unexpected symptom of increased sweating associated with hypoglycaemia in diabetic patients taking beta-blockers. Another important concept behind some medical myths is the over-reliance on case reports or authoritative texts. Concern about depression associated with beta-blocker use arose from a widely referenced case report. Subsequent studies have shown no convincing evidence of a strong association between beta-blocker use and depression. The strong position taken against the use of narcotics in Cope's Early Diagnosis of Acute Abdomen is probably the reason for the perpetuation of the myth of avoiding narcotics for pain relief in patients with undiagnosed acute abdominal conditions. The only two studies that addressed this issue showed no problems with diagnosis caused by giving painkillers with narcotics. Newer therapies generally undergo more scrutiny before being accepted, often including placebo-controlled trials to show a drug's effectiveness. Such might not be the case with newer technologies. It is more difficult to assess the benefit of a new technology versus older non-comparable technologies. Right heart catheterization (Swan-Ganz catheter) was a technology that was widely used before outcome studies were available. Multiple reports over the past decade have shown increased mortality and resource utilization in patients who received right-sided heart catheterization. Most new drug therapies require randomized data to show effects before widespread use and acceptance occurs. Older therapies that have been widely accepted for a long time may not have had controlled trial data behind recommendations for their use, and once practice patterns become widespread they are difficult to change. It's always good to ask the question, ""Will this help my patient live better or longer?"" when prescribing therapy. These myths underscore the importance and usefulness of outcome-based research to help guide clinicians in their practices.",0,0

82,10221346,Effects of spironolactone and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with essential hypertension.,,"Sato, A; Suzuki, Y; Saruta, T","There is increasing evidence for the important cardiovascular effects of aldosterone through classical mineralocorticoid receptors in the heart. Administration of aldosterone with excess salt produces both cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac interstitial fibrosis in rats, and concomitant administration of potassium canrenoate at a dose that only modestly lowers blood pressure completely blocks the cardiac effects of aldosterone. In the present study, we examined the effect on left ventricular hypertrophy of adding a low dose of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone (25 mg/d) to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril maleate) in patients with essential hypertension. . Eighteen untreated patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension according to WHO/ISH guidelines participated in this study. Subjects were treated with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor alone (group I: 10 patients, 4 men and 6 women, mean age 56 +/- 18 years) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor plus spironolactone (group II). : 8 patients, 3 men and 5 women, mean age 59 +/- 14 years) for 9 months. Left ventricular mass index, various echocardiographic variables, mean arterial pressure, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone concentration before treatment were similar in the two groups. The blood pressure of both groups decreased significantly and similarly after antihypertensive treatment (group I, 136 +/- 9/82 +/- 9 mmHg; group II, 133 +/- 9/85 +/- 10 mmHg). Left ventricular mass index also decreased significantly in both groups (group I, -10.2 +/- 7.1%; group II, -18.1 +/- 6.9%). The degree of reduction was significantly greater in the spironolactone group (group II) (p < 0.05 vs. group I). In group II patients, spironolactone did not cause any side effects during the observation period.

This was a large open-label multicentre study in which patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension received trandolapril (2 mg) once daily for 30 to 60 days in addition to their usual treatment. Trandolapril was packaged in electronic pillboxes that recorded the date and time of each opening.

Of the total number of patients, 37% had poor compliance; 29% of patients missed more than 10% of doses and 36% of patients delayed more than 10% of doses. Ranked predictors of poor adherence were: age <60 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.80 [1.49 to 2.17], P = .0001), Paris area (OR, 1.70 [1.32 to 2.19], P = 0.0001), smokers (OR, 1.65 [1.29 to 2.11], P = 0.0001), monotherapy (OR, 1.40 [1 .14 to 1.72], P = .0012) and baseline diastolic blood pressure > or = 100 mm Hg (OR, 1.21 [1.01 to 1.46], P = .044).

Analyzes included 150 patients (continuing ramipril: n = 74; switching to ramipril: n = 76) who had at least three GFR measurements (including baseline) during the entire observation period and a subgroup of 43 patients ( who continued ramipril: n = 26; switched to ramipril: n = 17) who had at least six GFR measurements, including at least three in the baseline study and at least three in the follow-up study. Ramipril (1.25 to 5 mg/d) and conventional therapy aimed to achieve a diastolic BP below 90 mm Hg. The main efficacy variables were GFR and ESRF (need for dialysis). Analysis was by intention to treat. Throughout the study, the mean +/- SEM rate of decline in GFR (deltaGFR) was significantly lower in patients who continued ramipril compared with those who switched to ramipril (0.51 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.76 +/- 0.10 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per month, P<0.03).

88,10235696,Nebivolol in the treatment of essential hypertension: a review.,,"McNeely, W; Goa, K L","Nebivolol is a lipophilic beta1 blocker. It lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane-stabilizing activity, but appears to have nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatory effects. Nebivolol is administered as a racemic mixture of equal proportions of the d and l enantiomers. The drug does not significantly influence glucose or plasma lipid metabolism and appears to have a protective effect on left ventricular function. At the recommended dose (5 mg once daily), nebivolol lowers resting diastolic blood pressure with the same efficacy as standard therapeutic doses of atenolol, metoprolol, lisinopril, and nifedipine, as shown in comparative trials. Nebivolol lowered blood pressure significantly more than enalapril 10 mg daily in the short term but not in the long term, although the dose of enalapril may not have been optimal. Nebivolol has an additive effect in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Standing blood pressure and/or 24-hour mean ambulatory blood pressure is significantly and similarly reduced by nebivolol, atenolol, or nifedipine. Nebivolol tended to prevent early morning blood pressure rises better than nifedipine. Overall response rates to nebivolol treatment (a decrease in sitting/supine diastolic blood pressure to < or = 90 mm Hg or a 10% or > or = 10 mm Hg drop in diastolic blood pressure) ranged from 58 and 81% after 4 to 52 weeks treatment. In comparative studies, response rates were higher in those receiving nebivolol than in those receiving enalapril or metoprolol, but were not significantly different from those receiving atenolol or nifedipine. Nebivolol 5 mg once daily is well tolerated in patients with hypertension. Adverse events are rare, transient, and mild to moderate. The most common include headache, fatigue, paresthesia and dizziness. Several studies reported no signs of orthostatic hypotension with nebivolol. Comparative trials revealed no significant differences between the frequency and severity of adverse events in patients receiving nebivolol, atenolol, enalapril, or placebo; however, the overall incidence of adverse events was higher with nifedipine or metoprolol. Some recipients of atenolol or enalapril, but not nebivolol, reported impotence or decreased libido during therapy; Current evidence indicates that nebivolol 5 mg once daily is a well-tolerated beta-blocker that is as effective as atenolol once daily and other classes of antihypertensive agents.

Randomized treatments were indapamide 1.25 mg daily, sodium chloride 80 mmol daily, the combination of indapamide and sodium chloride, and placebo. All patients received perindopril 4 mg daily and maintained a low-sodium diet; 19 patients entered and 17 completed the study. Before randomization, mean sitting blood pressure was 162/101 mm Hg and mean 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was 157 mmol/day. Compared with the phase in which patients received perindopril with sodium replacement, clinical and ambulatory BP were significantly (p<0.01) reduced in all other phases. Indapamide had a greater effect on BP than dietary sodium restriction and, in combination, their effects were additive. The effect of indapamide on ambulatory BP persisted through 24 hours, but the effect of the low-salt diet was seen predominantly during waking hours; In hypertensive patients with AP resistant to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril, the diuretic indapamide had greater additional efficacy and longer duration of action than dietary sodium restriction.

After 2 weeks on placebo, patients with a supine diastolic blood pressure of 95-115 mm Hg were randomized to receive felodipine-metoprolol, 5/50 mg once daily (Logimax) or captopril-hydrochlorothiazide, 25/25 mg once daily (Capozide). After another 4 weeks, there was a mandatory dose increase to felodipine-metoprolol 10/100 mg once daily and captopril-hydrochlorothiazide 50/25 mg once daily, and then treatment continued for another 4 weeks. At the end of the study, felodipine-metoprolol reduced supine blood pressure significantly more than captopril-hydrochlorothiazide. Mean differences in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure change between treatments after 8 weeks were 5.2 and 3.4 mm Hg, respectively, in favor of felodipine-metoprolol (p<0.05) . Standing blood pressure also showed trends in favor of felodipine-metoprolol. The proportion of responders was similar in both groups. Both treatments were well tolerated. Two patients treated with felodipine-metoprolol and 5 with captopril-hydrochlorothiazide discontinued treatment due to adverse events. The combination of felodipine and metoprolol reduced supine blood pressure significantly more than captopril-hydrochlorothiazide with sustained tolerability.",0,0

In this study, we measured rates of total, oxidative, and nonoxidative glucose disposal, glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, endogenous glucose production, and lipid oxidation using a 4-h euglycemic (approximately 5 mmol/L) hyperinsulinemic (approximately 300 pmol/L) clamp in combination with dual infusion of glucose tracer ([3-(3)H]- and [U-14C] D-glucose) and indirect calorimetry in 40 non-obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. Subjects were studied twice: after a 4-week run-in period and after a 16-week period of randomized double-blind treatment with 4-6 mg/day of lacidipine, a calcium channel blocker (n = 19), or lisinopril 10-20 mg/day, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 21). Antihypertensive treatment resulted in a significant increase in total glucose disposal during insulin clamping, as well as in basal and insulin-stimulated nonoxidative glucose disposal rates. In contrast, oxidative glucose clearance was significantly reduced by antihypertensive treatment, mainly in the basal state. Changes in glucose disposal rates were not significantly different in subjects treated with lacidipine and those treated with lisinopril. Suppression of endogenous glucose production during insulin clamping was significantly greater after lacidipine than after lisinopril. These results suggest that treatment of type 2 diabetic subjects with lacidipine or lisinopril has no adverse effects on glucose metabolism. On the contrary, both drugs appear to improve insulin sensitivity.",0,0

Ninety-one of the 142 patient visits were for severe hypertension in the absence of acute target organ involvement or neuroretinopathy. Eighty-nine patients received acute pharmacological treatment. Twenty-nine patients received two drugs and 15 received three drugs. Sixty-eight patients (75%) received clonidine and 15 (16.5%) received short-acting nifedipine despite widely published concerns about the safety of this practice. We found wide variability in blood pressure response to treatment. The mean decrease in SBP was 50+/-31 mm Hg and the mean decrease in DBP was 34+/-20 mm Hg over 4.2+/-2.9 h. Forty-two patients (46%) had SBP reduced to less than 160 mm Hg and 46 patients (50%) had DBP less than 100 mm Hg. Long-term management and follow-up were suboptimal.

In the 2 hypertensive groups, plasma renin activity increased significantly after pharmacological treatment; however, there was no significant change in norepinephrine concentration. Before drug treatment, the 2 hypertensive groups had significantly higher tPA and PAI-1 activity than normotensive subjects. In the enalapril group, there were no significant changes in tPA, although PAI-1 activity decreased significantly after drug treatment. In the nitrendipine group, there were no significant changes in tPA although PAI-1 activity increased significantly after drug treatment; Thus, enalapril ameliorated impaired fibrinolysis, but nitrendipine further aggravated fibrinolysis in essential hypertension. Taking into account the effect of antihypertensive drugs on the fibrinolytic system, a more effective and beneficial treatment could be selected for hypertensive patients, especially those with a high risk of thrombus formation.",0,0

The characteristic vascular changes lead to systemic and renal vasoconstriction. Changes in blood pressure are commonly associated with altered circadian regulation and can promote the rapid development of target organ lesions, including intracranial hemorrhage, left ventricular hypertrophy, and microangiopathic hemolysis. The mechanisms underlying this disorder are complex and include impaired vascular endothelial function. Vasodilators such as prostacyclin and nitric oxide are suppressed, while vasoconstrictors, including endothelin, are increased. Changes in the kidney include vasoconstriction, reduced glomerular filtration, and sodium retention. Effective therapy depends on rigorous control of blood pressure by administration of vasodilator agents, paying attention to possible interactions with cyclosporine.",0,0

111,10356671,Sexual dysfunction related to antihypertensive agents: results from the animal model.,,"Srilatha, B; Adaikan, P G; Arulkumaran, S; Ng, S C","The present investigation elucidates the deleterious effects of three prototypical antihypertensive drugs, namely propranolol, clonidine, and captopril on erectile physiology. In order to delineate the direct effects of the drug on vascular insufficiency inherent in hypertensive states, the study was performed in a normotensive animal model. Adverse effects of these drugs were estimated as changes in sexual behavior and intracavernosal pressure response to electrical stimulation in treated rats compared to age-matched normal controls (n = 10, each group). Copulation studies indicated significant impairment of sexual function in the propranolol and clonidine groups. The cavernous pressure response to nerve stimulation at the end of sixteen weeks further reinforced the severe compromise of sexual function in these two treated groups. In contrast, captopril administration produced only marginal alterations in the responses recorded. The results of this study clearly indicate that propranolol and clonidine interfere with sexual behavior and the nervous response to erection, while captopril, which lacks significant effects on these parameters, may be a better therapeutic option.",0,0

This study describes a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized trial of the effects of Perindopril (4 mg/d) on kidney structure and function over 2 years in 26 type 2 diabetic patients with proteinuria ranging from 70 to 4210 mg/day and relatively preserved GFR (creatinine clearance > 60 ml/min). All patients underwent an initial renal biopsy, but four (15%) were not randomized due to the presence of non-diabetic nephropathy. The remaining 22 were randomized (11 Perindopril [PE], 11 placebo [PO]), and 19 (9 PE, 10 PO) underwent a 2-year follow-up biopsy. BP was controlled equally in both groups at all times. Proteinuria increased in PO patients (+1562 mg/d) but decreased in PE patients (-156 mg/d) (P < 0.05). Morphometric analysis was performed by light microscopy using a Biocom computer. Over 2 years, baseline identical mean cortical interstitial fractional volume increased significantly in PO patients (31.7 +/- 5.3 vs. 40.2 +/- 11.1%; P = .001), but it did not change in patients with PD (33.8 +/- 4.9 vs. 34.7 +/- 6.6%; P = 0.50). It is concluded that: (1) non-diabetic nephropathy is present in approximately 15% of albuminuric type 2 diabetic patients; and (2) Perindopril prevents interstitial expansion in hypertensive patients with biopsy-proven diabetic glomerulopathy.

A total of 1,247 patients (11%) were treated with ACE inhibitors. Of these, 618 patients (50%) used aspirin; Five-year mortality was lower among patients treated with ACE inhibitors and aspirin than among patients treated with ACE inhibitors without aspirin (19% vs. 27%; P < .001). After adjusting for confounders, treatment with aspirin and ACE inhibitors remained associated with a lower mortality risk than the use of ACE inhibitors alone (relative risk [RR] = 0.71; confidence interval [ 95% CI] = 0.56 to 0.91). Subgroup analysis of 464 patients with congestive heart failure treated with ACE inhibitors revealed 221 patients (48%) with aspirin and 243 patients without aspirin. Although clinical characteristics and therapy were similar, patients who took aspirin experienced lower mortality than patients who did not take aspirin (24% vs. 34%; p = 0.001). After adjustment, aspirin treatment was still associated with lower mortality (RR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.99); Among patients with coronary artery disease with and without heart failure treated with ACE inhibitors, aspirin use was associated with lower mortality than non-aspirin treatment.

For vascular endothelium, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of the most potent and specific growth factors, acting protectively against endothelial dysfunction. HGF production is downregulated by angiotensin II (Ang II) in vitro. We hypothesized that HGF production is impaired as a result of increased Ang II in patients with congestive heart failure and that, if so, the decreased production should be restored with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-I) inhibitors. We studied 16 patients with congestive heart failure secondary to anterior myocardial infarction in whom the left ventricular ejection fraction was 35+/-8% (mean+/-SD). Before and approximately 4 weeks after ACE-I treatment, blood samples were collected to measure levels of HGF, Ang II, and brain natriuretic peptide as a biochemical marker of heart failure severity. We also studied 5 control subjects, in whom heparin increased HGF production by 48+/-5-fold. However, in patients with heart failure, the HGF response to heparin was significantly attenuated (24+/-5-fold, P<0.05 vs. control). ACE-I therapy decreased Ang II and brain natriuretic peptide levels and restored HGF production in response to heparin by 43+/-7-fold, comparable to control response. In conclusion, impaired HGF production was restored after ACE-I treatment probably by the mechanism of Ang II suppression. This novel effect of ACE-I may contribute to clinical improvement in patients with heart failure and thus may have an important therapeutic implication.",0,0

The most common adverse events in the nitrendipine group were headache (23.4%), flushing (21.3%), and ankle swelling (14.9%). In the moexipril group the most common adverse event was cough (8.9%); The results of the study suggest that moexipril and nitrendipine are equally effective at the doses given. In the patient population of postmenopausal women, the ACE inhibitor moexipril appears to have an advantage over the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine with respect to tolerability.",0,0

Cardiovascular autonomic control was assessed using frequency-domain measures of heart rate variability during spontaneous and controlled breathing trials. During the orthostatic maneuver and the cold pressure test, blood pressure variability analysis was also performed; In general, responses of heart rate and blood pressure variations were abnormal in patients with arterial hypertension and sleep apnea syndrome compared to baseline data. Of the four drugs, only atenolol affected heart rate and blood pressure variabilities by shifting autonomic regulation to the vagal direction. Other antihypertensive medications did not change any parameters of heart rate or blood pressure variability.; Short-term treatment with atenolol in patients with arterial hypertension and sleep apnea syndrome is associated with normalization of autonomic nervous control as judged by heart rate variability and blood pressure. Therefore, beta-receptor blockade may have complementary beneficial effects beyond blood pressure reduction in these patients. However, the long-term effects of blood pressure reduction on autonomic nervous control remain to be studied.",0,0

This fact suggests that captopril can release histamine from mast cells; Peritoneal mast cells were obtained from rats. The cells were purified by Percoll. Aliquots of mast cells were incubated with captopril or vehicle. Histamine was determined by spectrofluorimetric assay.; The results were analyzed with the Kruskall-Wallis test (ANOVA). The study has shown that captopril releases histamine from mast cells. The process depends on the presence of Ca2+ in the incubation environment. Sodium cromoglycate, as a mast cell membrane stabilizer, inhibits the effect of captopril; Our results suggest that the allergic side effects of captopril may be related to histamine release from mast cells.",0,0

Patients with diabetes mellitus have a high mortality after AMI, probably due to a high risk of congestive heart failure and reinfarction. Because ACE inhibition effectively slows the progression of heart failure, it could be particularly beneficial in diabetic patients after AMI; The study is a retrospective analysis using data from the Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of trandolapril in 1,749 patients with AMI and ejection fraction < or =35%. The mean follow-up time was 26 months.; A history of diabetes was found in 237 (14%) of the 1,749 patients.

The safety of the combined administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and aspirin has been questioned due to their divergent effects on the vascular synthesis of vasodilator prostaglandins; Forearm blood flow (ml/min/100 ml) at rest and during rhythmic handgrip exercise and after transient arterial occlusion was determined by strain gauge plethysmography before and 4 h and 6 weeks after combined administration of enalapril. with aspirin, ifetroban, or placebo in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial of 62 patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure; Before randomization, forearm hemodynamics were similar in the three treatment groups, except for increased resting forearm blood flow and decreased resting forearm vascular resistance in the aspirin group compared with the aspirin group. of placebo. After combined administration of enalapril and study drug for 4 hours and six weeks, changes from pre-randomization values of mean arterial pressure, forearm blood flow, and forearm vascular resistance at rest, during the hand grip exercise and after transient arterial occlusion did not differ between the three treatment groups. .; These findings demonstrate that the vasodilatory effects of enalapril on the skeletal muscle circulation of heart failure patients are not critically dependent on prostaglandin pathways.",0,0

Cardiac evaluation with trandolapril.,,"Torp-Pedersen, C; KÃ¸ber, L","The survival benefit of the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with acute myocardial infarction is generally presented in terms of hazard ratios and lives saved per 1000 people treated. A more relevant way of presenting the extent of benefit would be in terms of increased life expectancy, but this approach has not previously been possible due to limited data on long-term outcome. Our objective was to calculate the effect of trandolapril on life expectancy with follow-up data from the Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study; The TRACE study previously showed a significant survival benefit with trandolapril in patients with reduced left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction who were treated for at least 2 years. We determined the survival status of all patients in the TRACE study in June 1998, at which time they had been followed for a minimum of 6 years. Life expectancy was estimated as the median life, which was the time it took for 50% of patients to die. The change in life expectancy is expressed as the change in median life. Analysis was by intention to treat.; The life expectancy of the patients was 4.6 years for those who received placebo versus 6.2 years for those who received trandolapril. Therefore, for patients treated with trandolapril, the median lifespan increased by 15.3 months or 27% (95% CI 7 to 51). Follow-up analysis after the end of the study indicated no decrease in this benefit during the course of double-blind treatment; continued use of trandolapril was recommended at study closure; In patients with severely reduced left ventricular function, long-term treatment with an ACE inhibitor during the critical period after myocardial infarction is associated with a substantial increase in life expectancy.",1,1

The drug dose was adjusted and a thiazide diuretic was added if necessary to achieve a goal office BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg. Both drugs significantly lowered BP, but the effect of lisinopril was greater (P < 0.009): mean daytime and nighttime BP decreased from 152/98 and 135/84 mm Hg, respectively, to 133/85 and 118/74 mm Hg with enalapril and 129/83 and 116/70 mm Hg with lisinopril. BP goal was achieved with a mean dose of 18 mg enalapril with 8 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 17 mg lisinopril combined with 6 mg diuretic. Trough:peak ratio values, which were calculated after Fourier analysis of ABPM data in individual patients, were independent of drug dose. The combination with the diuretic resulted in slightly higher trough:maximum ratios than with ACE inhibitor monotherapy, but the difference was not significant. The median trough:peak ratio in patients using enalapril-based therapy was 0.48 and when taking lisinopril-based therapy, it was 0.65 (n = 28, P < 0.005). A significant correlation was found between the trough:peak ratio and changes in daytime mean arterial pressure (MAP; Spearman r= 0.43) and nocturnal MAP (r= 0.66). When 24-hour ABPM was performed starting 24 hours after the last drug intake, both ACE inhibitors still had a significant antihypertensive effect (P < 0.001), which was similar for both drugs.

The present study used 24-h recording methods to test the hypothesis that during rats' normal waking hours (overnight) the hypertensive response to a NaCl-rich diet is exacerbated in SHR and induced in treated WKY rats. with captopril for life.; SHR and WKY rats were (1) untreated, (2) captopril-treated for life, or (3) captopril-treated for life but withdrawn 2 weeks prior to exposure to a high-NaCl diet (8 %); Compared with untreated SHRs, in SHRs who were continuously treated with captopril, the high-NaCl diet caused a faster and greater rise in blood pressure. Discontinuation of captopril treatment did not significantly decrease this sensitivity to NaCl. In untreated WKY rats, the high NaCl diet did not alter mean arterial pressure, but in WKY rats treated with captopril for life, the high NaCl diet induced a rapid increase in blood pressure. In WKY rats, discontinuation of captopril treatment for life did not ameliorate this NaCl-induced increase in blood pressure, although baseline mean arterial pressure in this group is similar to that in untreated WKY rats; Lifelong treatment with captopril accelerates the hypertensive response to a NaCl-rich diet in SHR and induces a similar response in WKY rats. In both strains, lifelong treatment with captopril elicits a change in response that is not dependent on co-administration of the drug. This finding further suggests that lifelong treatment with captopril causes a long-term restoration of cardiovascular response mechanisms.",0,0
152,10421597,Trandolapril reduces the incidence of atrial fibrillation after acute myocardial infarction in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.,,"Pedersen, O D; Bagger, H; Kober, L; Torp-Pedersen, C","Studies have suggested that ACE inhibitors have an antiarrhythmic effect on ventricular arrhythmias. Whether they have an effect on atrial fibrillation is unknown; We investigated the effect of ACE inhibition with trandolapril on the incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients with reduced left ventricular function secondary to acute myocardial infarction. Patients in this study were those who qualified for inclusion in the TRAndolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, and who had sinus rhythm on ECG obtained at randomization. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomized to receive treatment with the ACE inhibitor trandolapril or placebo and were followed for 2 to 4 years. The primary endpoint of this investigation was the development and time to onset of atrial fibrillation on a 12-lead ECG recorded at outpatient visits. Of the 1,749 patients included in the TRACE study, 1,577 had sinus rhythm on the ECG recorded at randomization. Of these patients, 790 were randomized to treatment with trandolapril and 787 to treatment with placebo. The groups differed only slightly with respect to baseline characteristics. A total of 64 patients developed atrial fibrillation during the 2- to 4-year follow-up period. Significantly more patients developed atrial fibrillation in the placebo group than in the trandolapril group, 5.3% (n=42) versus 2.8% (n=22), respectively, P<0.05. Cox multivariate regression analysis, adjusting for significant baseline characteristics, revealed that treatment with trandolapril significantly reduced the risk of developing atrial fibrillation (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.76; P < 0.01); The results of the present study demonstrate that treatment with trandolapril reduces the incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction.",0,0
153,10423601,Usefulness of moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide in moderately severe essential hypertension.,,"White, W B; Koch, B; Stimpel, M","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor moexipril alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide versus hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy in patients with stage II and III essential hypertension. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial evaluating moexipril (15 and 30 mg once daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 and 50 mg once daily), and drug combinations (moexipril 15 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and moexipril 30 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg) in 272 hypertensive patients whose sitting diastolic blood pressure (BP) was 100 to 114 mm Hg. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in sitting diastolic BP at the end of the dosing period. Secondary measures of efficacy included changes in systolic BP and standing BP. The lower doses of moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide reduced diastolic BP similarly (-8.0 +/- 1.4 versus -8.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg; p = NS) as did the higher doses. discharges from monotherapeutic regimens (moexipril, -9.7 +/- 1.2 mm Hg). Hg vs. hydrochlorothiazide, -11.0 +/- 1.2 mm Hg, p = NS). Combinations of moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide lowered diastolic BP significantly more than either monotherapy (lower dose, -16.0 +/- 1.4 mm Hg; p < 0.001; higher dose, -17.9 +/- 1.2mm Hg, p < 0.001). Similar trends were observed for systolic BP. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 0% for patients on moexipril monotherapy and 3% to 5% in patients on diuretic or combination therapy. These data demonstrate that moexipril 15 and 30 mg once daily lowers BP similarly to hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage II and III hypertension. There is also an additive effect when the two agents are combined that lowers BP more significantly than either monotherapy.",0,0

At the end of this period, doses were adjusted to quinapril 20 mg once daily or captopril 25 mg twice daily at the physician's discretion if there were no major adverse reactions and if blood pressure was not below 110. /70mm Hg. Clinical symptoms of heart failure were significantly alleviated with both drugs at the end of a 12-week treatment period. At the start of the study, 23 (35%) of the 65 patients taking quinapril and 27 (41%) of the 66 patients taking captopril were in NYHA functional class III, whereas at the end of the trial only 4 (6%) ) of the patients in the quinapril group and 14 (22%; p < 0.05 vs. quinapril) patients in the captopril group were classified as NYHA class III. Both drugs had a positive effect on echocardiographic parameters. There was a statistically significant increase in exercise duration in both treatment groups (quinapril, 6.2 +/- 1.8 vs. 7.8 +/- 1.9 minutes, p < 0.001; captopril, 5.9 +/- /- 1.9 vs. 7.1 +/- 2.3 minutes, p < 0.001). One patient in the quinapril group died suddenly during the study and two patients in the captopril group dropped out of the study due to persistent dry cough. No patient in the quinapril group reported side effects. Three patients in the captopril group suffered from moderate dry cough, one taste blindness, and one unstable angina. The safety of the tested drugs was confirmed by laboratory tests. Quinapril was as effective as captopril in reducing signs and symptoms of heart failure and improving left ventricular function and exercise capacity with few side effects.",1,1

This 52-week, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, titration study of 578 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (mean diastolic blood pressure [DBP], >/=95 mm Hg) , compared the efficacy and safety of telmisartan (n = 385) with lisinopril (n = 193). The dose of both telmisartan (40 --> 80 --> 160 mg) and lisinopril (10 --> 20 --> 40 mg) could be increased at each of the first 2 monthly visits if DBP is controlled ( <90 mm Hg) had not been established. Once control of PAD was established, patients entered the 48-week maintenance period. During this period, the dose of study drug was fixed, although open-label HCTZ was added at 12.5 mg or 25 mg, when necessary, to regain control of PAD. At the end of the titration period, PAD control was achieved with monotherapy in 67% and 63% of patients with telmisartan and lisinopril, respectively. At the end of the maintenance period, supine DBP was controlled in 83% and 87% of patients treated with telmisartan and lisinopril, respectively, with reductions in systolic blood pressure over DBP of 23.8/16, 6 mm Hg for telmisartan and 19.9/15.6 mm Hg for lisinopril. . Treatment-related side effects occurred in fewer patients treated with telmisartan (28%) than in patients treated with lisinopril (40%; P = .001). Significantly fewer patients (p=0.018) receiving telmisartan experienced treatment-related cough (3% vs. 7%), and cough led to treatment discontinuation much less frequently (p=0.007) with telmisartan treatment than with lisinopril treatment (0.3% vs. 3.1%). In addition, two cases of angioedema were observed, both in the lisinopril group. The selective AT(1) receptor antagonist, telmisartan, is extremely effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension both alone and in combination with HCTZ and is at least comparable in efficacy to lisinopril, with a tolerability profile that may offer advantages in terms of a reduced incidence of adverse events.",0,0
156,10424316,Effects of captopril and enalapril on electroencephalogram and cognitive performance in healthy volunteers.,,"Ebert, U; Kirch, W","Captopril and enalapril have been reported to influence cognitive functions and quality of life in hypertensive patients; The effects of captopril (12.5 mg and 25 mg) and enalapril (5 mg and 10 mg) administered over 7-day periods on electroencephalogram (EEG), cognitive functions, and subjective assessments in healthy men were investigated; Neither captopril nor enalapril influenced EEG or cognitive functions compared to placebo. Captopril 12.5 mg decreased subjective activity compared to placebo. Enalapril did not alter subjective assessments. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly lower after administration of captopril 25 mg, whereas enalapril did not affect blood pressure compared to placebo; Our results suggest that the central effects of captopril and enalapril were minor and not constant in healthy young men.",0,0
157,10426836,Aspirin impairs exercise performance and pulmonary gas exchange in heart failure patients taking ACE inhibitors.,,"Guazzi, M; Pontone, G; Agostoni, P","Lung function abnormalities are involved in the cause of exercise inability in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Impaired pulmonary gas transfer is one of these abnormalities. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve carbon monoxide diffusion and exercise capacity, an effect apparently mediated by prostaglandin activation because it is inhibited by cyclooxygenase blockade with aspirin. This suggests the possibility that aspirin may impair lung function and exercise capacity in CHF, at least in those patients taking ACE inhibitors. This study aimed to test this hypothesis.; A dose of 325 mg aspirin daily for 8 weeks was administered to 26 consecutive patients with primary dilated cardiomyopathy (New York Heart Association class II or III) whose current outpatient anti-failure therapy included (group 1, 18 cases) or did not include ( group 2, 8 cases) an ACE inhibitor in addition to digoxin and furosemide. During the study, ACE inhibition was continued in group 1 by administering 20 mg of enalapril daily; Repeat testing at 8 weeks showed aspirin to be harmful in group 1. Compared with the previous period, resting carbon dioxide, maximal exercise oxygen consumption (VO2 max), and tidal volume levels were reduced in this group; the relationship between exercise minute ventilation and carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO(2)) increased and its variations were inversely related to those of VO(2) max. Similar results were not observed in group 2; however, once this part of the study was completed and enalapril was included in the current therapeutic regimen, an inhibitory effect of aspirin on carbon dioxide, VO(2) max, tidal volume max, and VE/ VCO(2) at 1 L levels became evident and was similar to that observed in group 1; Aspirin does not affect ventilation efficiency or VO2 max in CHF patients not taking ACE inhibitors, but worsens pulmonary diffusion of carbon monoxide, VO2, and ventilatory response to exercise in the presence of ACE inhibitors . This may be relevant in patients with CHF due to ischemic heart disease. Whether the same may be true for smaller doses of aspirin was not investigated in this study.",0,0

Several etiologic factors have been implicated, including drugs, total parenteral nutrition, sepsis, pregnancy, graft-versus-host disease, and systemic disorders such as sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and Hodgkin's disease. The pathogenesis of cholestasis is unclear, and several mechanisms have been hypothesized, without convincing evidence that any of them play a role in clinical cholestasis. Despite the uncertainty about the pathophysiology of intrahepatic cholestasis, various forms of treatment have been used. Ursodeoxycholic acid can relieve itching and lethargy and, in some cases, can modify the progression of the disease. If cholestasis persists, supportive therapy is important to maintain optimal physical and nutritional well-being. In patients with advanced liver disease associated with hepatocellular failure, liver transplantation is the only viable option.",0,0

In REIN stratum 1, reported here, 24-hour proteinuria was 1 g or more but less than 3 g per 24 hours; In stratum 1 of this double-blind trial, 186 patients were randomly assigned to a ramipril or control group (placebo plus conventional antihypertensive therapy) whose goal was to achieve a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. Primary endpoints were change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and time to ESRF or overt proteinuria (> or = 53 g/24 h). The median follow-up was 31 months.; The decrease in GFR per month was not significantly different (ramipril 0.26 [SE 0.05] ml per min per 1.73 m2, control 0.29 [0.06]). Progression to ESRF was significantly less frequent in the ramipril group (9/99 vs 18/87) for a relative risk (RR) of 2.72 (95% CI: 1.22-6.08); so was progression to overt proteinuria (15/99 vs 27/87, RR 2.40 [1.27-4.52]). Patients with a baseline GFR of 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or less and proteinuria of 1.5 g/24 h or more had faster progression and benefited more from ramipril treatment. Proteinuria decreased by 13% in the ramipril group and increased by 15% in the controls. Cardiovascular events were similar.

The risk of an individual developing CVD is greatly increased when both diseases coexist and is further magnified by their frequent association with dyslipidemia, coagulation, platelet, and endothelial abnormalities. The metabolic abnormalities frequently associated with hypertension are insulin resistance, increased coagulation, and decreased fibrinolytic activity. Pharmacological treatment of hypertension in diabetic subjects is fraught with potential difficulties, including altered drug efficacy, potential side effects, worsening of glycemic control, and impaired lipid metabolism. Because hypertension is one of the major contributors to morbidity and mortality in diabetes, it must be recognized and treated early and aggressively despite these difficulties.

Mayo Nephrology Collaborative Group.,,"Donadio, J V; Grande, J P; Bergstralh, E J; Dart, R A; Larson, T S; Spencer, D C","Dietary fish oil supplementation was previously reported to delay the progression of kidney disease in patients with IgA nephropathy in a 2-year, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial. The aim of this study was to determine the long-term influence of fish oil treatment on renal progression based on observations from the study cohort of 106 patients that extended beyond the 2-year trial. Renal function was assessed by serial determinations of serum creatinine and 24-h urine protein. Vital end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and BP status and treatment were determined beyond the completion of the 2-year trial. As in the trial, the primary endpoint was a 50% or greater increase in serum creatinine, and the secondary endpoint was ESRD. After a mean follow-up of 6.4 years, 46 patients (17 in the fish oil group vs. 29 in the placebo group) reached the primary endpoint (P = 0.002), and 27 patients (eight in the of fish oil versus 19 in the placebo group developed ESRD (P = 0.009).At the end of the 2-year trial, 75 patients (45 on fish oil, 30 on placebo) remained at risk for the primary endpoint. This is also when the double-blind portion of the trial ended, allowing doctors to stop the supplements, switch the original patients assigned to placebo to fish oil, and continue fish oil in the original patients assigned to fish oil. Significantly more patients who did not receive placebo supplementation developed the primary endpoint (P = 0.02) and ESRD (P = 0.003) compared with patients who received long-term fish oil supplementation. Conversely, more patients who received fish oil supplementation had stable kidney function than patients who did not receive supplementation (P = 0.02). By intention, BP control, treated primarily with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, was the same in the fish oil and placebo groups. Proteinuria was modestly reduced in both groups. It is concluded that early and prolonged treatment with fish oil slows renal progression in high-risk patients with IgA nephropathy.",0,0

Relatively few head-to-head studies have been published between fixed-dose combinations and first-line monotherapies for hypertension. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of various first-line monotherapies and the fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/benazepril. The results of the meta-analysis were used to compare the efficacy and safety of first-line amlodipine/benazepril monotherapies. The meta-analysis included 82 studies that included 110 treatment groups (cohorts). The study compared nine different monotherapies and one combination therapy (amlodipine/benazepril). Of the 82 studies, 22 were placebo-controlled and 60 were active-controlled. The mean absolute decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) ranged from 9.7 to 13.3 mm Hg, with verapamil showing the greatest effect and captopril the least (13.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg). ; 9.7 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, respectively). When studies were weighted for sample size, atenolol, verapamil, lisinopril, and amlodipine/benazepril showed the greatest effect on BP. When studies were weighted for variance, amlodipine/benazepril and atenolol showed the greatest effect on BP. The percentage of patients controlled with therapy ranged from 54% to 79%. Lisinopril and amlodipine/benazepril showed the highest controlled percentage. The overall incidence of adverse events ranged from 12.1% to 41.8%, with lisinopril being the lowest and nifedipine being the highest. The overall incidence of adverse events leading to drug discontinuation ranged from 1.3% to 10.7%, with amlodipine/benazepril being the lowest and nifedipine the highest. The results of the meta-analysis indicate that amlodipine/benazepril produces higher than average BP reductions with a lower than average incidence of overall side effects and the lowest incidence of adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation. The amlodipine/benazepril fixed-dose combination achieves its goal of effective BP lowering with a minimum of significant side effects.",0,0

Eprosartan Multinational Study Group.,,"Sega, R","The efficacy of eprosartan, an orally active, highly selective, non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonist, was compared with that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril. , with the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) when necessary in patients with severe hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [sitDBP] > or = 115 mmHg and < or = 125 mmHg). Patients (n = 118) were randomized in an 8-week double-blind titration phase and started on a total daily dose of 400 mg eprosartan orally, administered twice daily, or a total daily dose of 10 mg eprosartan. Oral enalapril, administered once daily. The dose of eprosartan was increased to 600 and 800 mg daily, given twice daily, and that of enalapril to 20 and 40 mg daily, given once daily, at weeks 2 and 4 if sitting DBP was > or = 90mmHg. If blood pressure remained uncontrolled on the maximum doses of eprosartan or enalapril at week 6, HCTZ 25 mg once daily was added to the treatment regimen. Patients whose blood pressure was deemed medically acceptable by the investigator at week 8 entered a 2-week maintenance phase with the final dose used in the titration phase. The main measure of efficacy was the difference between treatments in mean reduction from baseline in sitDBP to the end of the study. Eprosartan and enalapril caused a similar reduction in sitDBP at the end of the study. The mean change in sitting DBP at the end of the study for the eprosartan group was -20.1 mmHg versus -16.2 mmHg for the enalapril group. However, eprosartan produced significantly greater decreases in sitting and standing systolic blood pressure (sitSBP and staSBP, respectively) than enalapril. The mean decrease in sit SBP was 29.1 mmHg for eprosartan compared to 21.1 mmHg for enalapril (p = 0.025). The mean reduction in staSBP was 27.8 mmHg for eprosartan compared to 20.0 mmHg for enalapril (p = 0.032). At the end of the study, the response rate (sitting DBP < 90 mmHg or decreased from baseline by at least 15 mmHg) was 69.5% in the eprosartan group and 54.2% in the enalapril group. The proportion of patients in each treatment group who required the addition of HCTZ was similar. Eprosartan was well tolerated; the overall incidence of adverse events was comparable to that of the enalapril group. These results demonstrate that in patients with severe hypertension, eprosartan is well tolerated and may be more effective than enalapril in lowering systolic blood pressure.",0,0

Acute infarction Ramipril Efficacy.,,"Spargias, K; Ball, S; Hall, A","After an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), patients with a history of arterial hypertension (AH) have a worse prognosis than normotensive patients. Whether this adverse risk is beneficially modulated by treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is unknown. We evaluated the prognostic value of a history of hypertension in post-AMI patients who received treatment with ACE inhibitors.; We retrospectively analyzed data from the AIRE study (randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ramipril in 2006 post-AMI patients with clinical heart failure). A history of HA was present in 28% of the patients. We examined the prognostic value of history of hypertension separately between patients treated with placebo and ramipril and also the effect of ramipril on clinical outcomes according to the presence or absence of history of AH; History of hypertension was a significant indicator of adverse prognosis in patients treated with placebo (P) (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% confidence intervals 1.13 to 1.97, P = 0.005), but not in patients treated with ramipril ® (1.17, 0.84 to 1.61). , p = 0.34).

171,10456379,"Drug-induced cognitive disorders in the elderly: incidence, prevention, and treatment.",,"Gray, S L; Lai, K V; Larson, E B","The aetiology of cognitive impairment is multifactorial; however, drugs are a major cause of delirium and dementia. Several factors may increase the risk of drug-induced cognitive disorders in the elderly, including imbalances in neurotransmitters (eg, acetylcholine), age-related alterations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and high levels of medication use. Almost any drug can cause cognitive impairment in susceptible people; however, certain classes are more commonly implicated. Benzodiazepines, opioids, anticholinergics, and tricyclic antidepressants are probably the worst offenders. Older antihypertensive agents (reserpine, clonidine) have negative effects on cognition; however, large clinical trials in the elderly indicate that commonly used agents [eg. eg, thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers (amiodipine, diltiazem), ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalapril), and beta-blockers (atenolol)] have minimal effects on cognition. Newer antidepressants, such as selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and reversible monoamine oxidase A inhibitors, have not been shown to have negative effects on cognition. Although some medications have shown a low risk of causing cognitive impairment in research studies, the risk may be increased in frail older adults taking multiple medications, and each case should be carefully reviewed. Identification of drug-induced cognitive impairment is crucial for early detection and resolution of symptoms. Preventive strategies aimed at avoiding high-risk medications when possible, appropriate dosage adjustment based on age-related changes, and close monitoring can prevent these conditions.",0,0

175,10467219,"Safety and efficacy of eprosartan, a new angiotensin II receptor blocker.",,"Shusterman, N H","Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been widely used in the treatment of hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases. However, this treatment approach is limited by the lack of specificity and the ongoing production of angiotensin II by other pathways. Angiotensin II receptor antagonism offers the potential to improve control of hypertension by providing more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition without bradykinin-related effects. Eprosartan is the only competitive non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole angiotensin II receptor antagonist clinically available and is highly selective for the AT1 receptor subtype. In clinical trials, eprosartan has been shown to reduce blood pressure effectively in a once-daily regimen in hypertensive patients. In the recommended dose range of 600 to 1,200 mg once daily, eprosartan is effective in patients with all degrees of hypertension, regardless of age, gender, or race. Furthermore, the tolerability profile of eprosartan is comparable to that of placebo, and no clinically relevant drug interactions are known. Several large-scale clinical trials are currently underway or planned to determine which of the growing number of AT1 receptor antagonists can reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates in different groups of hypertensive patients. Meanwhile, current evidence suggests that AT1 receptor antagonists represent a significant new approach to cardiovascular therapy and deserve further evaluation in hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.",0,0

In the present study, however, we examined various antioxidant defenses in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients treated with enalapril (10 mg/day) for at least 6 months (+ACEi; n = 11) or untreated (-ACEi; n = 11). The relationship between antioxidant status and HD was investigated by determining markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses in a group of chronic HD patients (n = 33) and a group of age-matched controls (n = 29). The effect of a single HD session on these parameters was also evaluated. Before an HD session (pre-HD), HD patients had significantly lower levels of red blood cell (RBC) glutathione (GSH), selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity (RBC-Se-GPx), ubiquinol- 10 in plasma and alpha-tocopherol than controls. In a group of randomly selected patients (n = 19), a single session of HD caused an additional decrease in plasma RBC-GSH and ubiquinol-10 levels. Plasma levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) were significantly higher in pre-HD patients than in controls. Post-HD plasma TBARS levels were similar to control values. The +ACEi HD patient cohort had higher pre-HD RBC-GSH content, RBC-Se-GPx activity, and plasma beta-carotene concentrations than the -ACEi patients (RBC-GSH: +ACEi, 3, 1 +/- 0.9 micromol/mL concentrated red blood cells [PRBC], -ACEi, 1.2 +/- 0.3 micromol/mL PRBC [P < 0.05 v +ACEi], RBC-Se- GPx: +ACEi, 5.8 +/- 0.7 U/mL of PRBC, -ACEi, 4.3 +/- 0.2 U/mL of red blood cells [P < 0.05 v +ACEi], beta-carotene in plasma: +ACEi, 0.54 +/- 0.16 micromol/L plasma, -ACEi, 0.19 +/- 0.05 micromol/L plasma [P < 0.05 v +ACEi]). The results show profound alterations in the circulating antioxidant systems of chronic HD patients and that additional oxidative stress occurs during the HD procedure.

In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had severe heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35 percent and who were being treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and , in most cases, digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive spironolactone 25 mg daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.; The trial was stopped early, after a median follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis found spironolactone to be effective. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46 percent) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35 percent; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P<0.001). This 30 percent reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77). ; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in heart failure symptoms as assessed by New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10 percent of men who were treated with spironolactone, compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P < 0.001). The incidence of severe hyperkalaemia was minimal in both groups of patients.; Aldosterone receptor blockade by spironolactone, in addition to standard therapy, substantially reduces the risk of morbidity and death among patients with severe heart failure.",0,0

Fixed combination at low doses.,,"McClellan, K J; Markham, A","Low-dose drug combinations have been proposed in International Guidelines for use in patients with hypertension. The low-dose fixed combination of perindopril 2 mg with indapamide 0.625 mg combines an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with a non-thiazide diuretic. Co-administration of perindopril and indapamide had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of either agent in healthy volunteers. In experimental models of hypertension, perindopril/indapamide restored endothelial function, improved microvascular density, reduced left ventricular and aortic hypertrophy, and reversed renal target organ damage. Once daily oral perindopril 2 mg/indapamide 0.625 mg normalized blood pressure (BP) in 83.6% of elderly patients with essential hypertension (diastolic BP decreased to < or = 90 mm Hg) and in 81 .7% of those with isolated systolic hypertension (systolic BP fell). to <160 mm Hg) after approximately 1 year of treatment. BP normalization was maintained in 79.8% of patients throughout the study.

Therefore, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with aspirin can theoretically attenuate the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. This trial studied the interaction between aspirin (ASA) and enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, and ASA and losartan, an angiotensin subtype 1 receptor antagonist. Seventeen essential hypertensive patients, maintained on a stable dose of enalapril (n = 7) or losartan (n = 10) monotherapy for > or = 12 weeks before and throughout the study, were studied.

Blood pressure (BP) and serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) samples were obtained at the end of each treatment period. Placebo was compared with each dose of ASA for each group. In both the enalapril and losartan groups, mean, systolic, and diastolic BP did not change with the addition of ASA. TXB2 concentrations were suppressed to <10% in both ASA groups.

We used an algorithm to validate the diagnosis and evaluate the causal relationship between acute pancreatitis and the use of the suspected drug; A total of 55 cases were available for review. We excluded 11 (20.0%) reports, as we were unable to confirm the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. An additional 10 (18%) cases were excluded as a causal relationship to the suspect drug was unlikely.

However, the role of selected agents in the development of hypoglycemia remains controversial. The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of antihypertensive agents on the risk of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients receiving insulin or sulfonylurea therapy. A matched case-control study was conducted using Pennsylvania Medicaid data. Five control subjects, matched for sex and age, with no reported medical condition of hypoglycemia, were randomly selected for each patient case admitted for hypoglycemia in 1993, resulting in a total of 404 cases and 1375 controls. With these sample sizes, we were able to detect a difference of 10% (P < 0.05) for our primary outcome, hospitalization for hypoglycemia. The relative risk of hypoglycemia was estimated using unconditional logistic regression. The risk of hypoglycemia was 5.5 times greater (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0 to 7.6) in insulin users compared to sulfonylurea users and was not affected by the use of inhibitors. angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in general. However, use of the ACE inhibitor enalapril was associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.3) in sulfonylurea users, suggesting that analyzing the unwanted side effects of a class of drugs can sometimes mask the adverse effects of individual drugs. The use of beta-blockers was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia, providing additional empirical evidence that beta-blockers are an appropriate treatment for people with concomitant diabetes and hypertension. Per capita health care costs were approximately 3 times higher in patients hospitalized for hypoglycemia compared with controls (P < 0.05). Hospitalization for hypoglycemia is costly and can be prevented with adequate management of diabetic patients taking selected antihypertensive agents, such as enalapril.",0,0

In diseases such as hypertension, blacks show pathophysiological differences and respond differently to some therapies than whites. The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical characteristics and response to therapy of black patients compared to white patients with heart failure.; In the first vasodilator heart failure trial (V-HeFT I), 180 black male patients were compared with 450 white male patients for baseline characteristics, prognosis, and response to therapy . In V-HeFT II, the same comparisons were made for 215 black and 574 white male patients, including an analysis stratified by the presence or absence of a history of hypertension. In both trials, black patients had a lower incidence of coronary artery disease, a higher incidence of prior hypertension, and a higher cardiothoracic index (p < 0.05) than white patients. In V-HeFT II, plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly lower in blacks; plasma renin activity was lower only in blacks with a history of hypertension. Overall mortality or hospitalization for congestive heart failure did not differ between blacks and whites in the placebo group in V-HeFT I. However, mortality in black patients receiving hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate (HI) was reduced (p = 0.04) in V -HeFT I, while white patients showed no difference from placebo. In V-HeFT II, only Caucasian patients showed a reduction in mortality with enalapril treatment compared with HI treatment (p = 0.02). Whites also showed evidence of greater blood pressure reduction and greater heart size regression in response to enalapril. When stratified by history of hypertension in V-HeFT II, only whites with a history of hypertension, who had higher renin levels, showed a significant reduction in mortality with enalapril compared with HI therapy. Hospitalization rates did not differ between treatment groups in any of the studies.; Whites and blacks showed differences in cause, neurohormonal stimulation, and pharmacological response in heart failure. This retrospective analysis suggests that ACE inhibitors are particularly effective in whites, and the HI combination may be equally effective in blacks.

Pharmacological treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers improves survival and reduces hospitalizations in patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Despite these therapies, morbidity and mortality remain problematic. Furthermore, between 30% and 50% of patients with CHF have a preserved LVEF. It is not known whether the treatments are beneficial in this group; Candesartan in Heart Failure-Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM) is a program designed to investigate the clinical utility of the long-acting angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, candesartan cilexetil, in a broad spectrum of patients with symptomatic heart failure. . Patients with systolic dysfunction, tolerant or intolerant to an ACE inhibitor, and patients with preserved systolic function are included. Specifically, the CHARM program consists of 3 independent, parallel, placebo-controlled studies in patients with (1) LVEF less than or equal to 40%, treated with ACE inhibitors (n=2,300); (2) LVEF less than or equal to 40%, intolerance to ACE inhibitors (n=1700); (3) LVEF greater than 40%, not treated with ACE inhibitors (n = 2,500). The 3 studies will be combined to assess the effect of candesartan cilexetil on all-cause mortality in the broad spectrum of symptomatic heart failure. The primary objective of each trial is to assess the effects on the combined endpoint of cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization for CHF. Other endpoints include effects on myocardial infarction, hospitalization for any cause, and resource utilization. CHARM is intended to randomize 6,500 patients with symptomatic heart failure from 26 countries in Europe, the United States, Canada, South Africa, and Australia.

Patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure (BP) > or = 110 mm Hg during the placebo run-in period received HCTZ 12.5 mg once daily for 1 week. Those with sitting diastolic BP >95 mm Hg after HCTZ run-in were randomized (2:1) to receive candesartan cilexetil 8 mg once daily (n = 141) or placebo (n = 76), plus 12.5 mg HCTZ. After 1 week of double-blind treatment, patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure > or = 90 mm Hg received candesartan cilexetil 16 mg once daily or matching placebo, plus HCTZ 12.5 mg; 84% required an increase in titration. The primary measure of efficacy was a change in sitting trough diastolic BP (24+/-3 hours after treatment) from the end of the HCTZ trial period to week 4 double-blind. Mean changes in systolic and diastolic BP were significantly greater with candesartan cilexetil. than placebo, -11.3/-9.1 mm Hg versus -4.1/-3.1 mm Hg, p<0.001/p<0.001, respectively. Patients with higher sitting diastolic BP at the end of the HCTZ run-in period tended to have greater BP decreases (p < 0.05). The majority of patients (53%) who received candesartan cilexetil responded (diastolic BP <90 mm Hg or > or =10 mm Hg decrease) and 32% were controlled (diastolic BP <90 mm Hg). The tolerability and safety profiles were similar in the candesartan and placebo groups. In conclusion, candesartan cilexetil 8 to 16 mg once daily was an effective and well-tolerated BP-lowering therapy when added to HCTZ 12.5 mg in a diverse population of patients with severe systemic hypertension in the United States.",0,0

Severe exfoliative rashes have also been associated with captopril, but a combined presentation of toxic epidermal necrolysis and agranulocytosis has not been previously reported. We present an unusual case of captopril-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis with agranulocytosis in a patient with no known risk factors. Bone marrow suppression was successfully treated using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and white blood cell (WBC) counts recovered within 3 days of starting therapy.

It is also the most treatable risk factor. Results from 18 controlled trials show a 25% to 47% relative risk reduction of stroke among treated hypertensive patients. This reduction applies to both the elderly and younger patients, but the absolute reductions are greater among the elderly and the number of patients with hypertension who need treatment to prevent a stroke is lower in the elderly because they are at higher risk of stroke. . . The relative, but not absolute, risk reductions appear to be similar for both isolated systolic hypertension and combined systolic and diastolic hypertension in the elderly. The case for antihypertensive treatment in secondary prevention of stroke is less clear, but the results of four clinical trials of antihypertensive treatment among patients with and without hypertension and a history of cerebrovascular disease point to a likely benefit.

This dose was changed 3 times to treat all patients with lower, higher, and initial doses for 4 weeks each. Neurohormones (atrial natriuretic peptide [ANP], brain natriuretic peptide [BNP], and norepinephrine) and enalaprilat trough levels were measured, and ergospirometry was performed; Changes in enalapril dose and enalaprilat level were concordant in 82% of patients, indicating good compliance.

There is now considerable interest in a growing number of environmental agents. There have been two epidemics in recent years: one in Spain due to a contaminant in rapeseed oil and another in the United States due to an l-tryptophan contaminant that caused eosinophilic myositis.

195,10503655,Etiology and mechanisms of drug-induced lupus.,,"Rubin, R L","Systemic rheumatic symptoms occur with very different frequencies as a side effect of long-term therapy with some 39 drugs currently in use. Because symptoms are nonspecific, subjective, and changeable, the diagnosis of drug-induced lupus (DIL) requires knowledge of this chronic medication risk. However, laboratory features and the characteristic of complete recovery after discontinuation of treatment are helpful in differentiating drug-induced from spontaneous lupus or other syndromes. Drug-induced lupus is probably mediated by reactive drug metabolites, not ingested drugs, and susceptibility to neutrophil-mediated oxidative transformation is a property of ten lupus-inducing drugs reported so far. Mechanisms for DIL modeled from drug hypersensitivity reactions are experimentally unsupported and inconsistent with features of DIL. However, several new lines of research using mouse models have opened up promising clues about the origin of autoreactive T cells and disease development in DIL.",0,0

A prospective randomized parallel group trial was conducted to assess acute, intermediate, and chronic changes in hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and renal variables in response to PGE1, dobutamine, and placebo. Thirty patients with class III and IV heart failure and low cardiac index (mean 1.9 l/min/m2) two hours after administration of oral drugs, including high-dose enalapril, were included. A 7-day infusion of PGE1 (16.5 +/- 5 ng/kg/min, range 10 to 20 ng/kg/min, group A n = 10), dobutamine (4.5 +/- 1 micrograms/ kg/min, range 2.5 to 5 micrograms/kg/min, group B n = 10) or placebo (saline, group C n = 10) was administered through a central venous access line after titration Gradual until intolerable side effects develop with PGE1 or a 20% increase. in cardiac index it occurred with dobutamine, which was continued at this dose while PGE1 was maintained at a maximum dose of 50%. Hemodynamic data were collected at baseline, at maximum doses, after 12 hours, and after 7 days. Of the neurohumoral variables, plasma norepinephrine, Big ET, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were simultaneously assessed by RIA methods. Renal plasma flow (by paraaminohippurate clearance) and glomerular filtration rate (by iothalamate clearance) were measured before and during the infusions (after 12 hours and after 7 days). Significant decreases from baseline in mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance were observed at the maximum dose and at 12 hours, accompanied by increased cardiac output with both PGE1 and PGE1. with dobutamine. These changes were maintained for 7 days when pulmonary vascular resistance levels also decreased with both active drugs. Blood pressure did not change throughout, but PGE1 slightly increased heart rate at 12 hours. Both PGE1 and dobutamine improved renal plasma flow after 7 days, but only PGE1 significantly decreased glomerular filtration fraction. Glomerular filtration rate did not change with either drug. PGE1 decreased ANP levels at 12 hours, and dobutamine increased large ET levels at peak, but decreased large ET at 7 days. Norepinephrine levels were unaffected at all times. Except for a slight decrease in right atrial pressure after 7 days, placebo did not significantly change any measured variables. Taken together, these data suggest that PGE1 treatment is as effective as low-dose dobutamine in improving cardiac output and renal perfusion in advanced heart failure. Importantly, no deleterious neurohumoral counterregulation was observed with PGE1.",0,0

Routine screening of all adults for microscopic hematuria with dipstick testing is not currently recommended because of the intermittent occurrence of this finding and the low incidence of significant associated urologic disease. However, once asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is discovered, its cause should be investigated with a complete medical history (including a review of current medications) and a focused physical examination. Laboratory and imaging studies, such as intravenous pyelography, renal ultrasonography, or retrograde pyelography, may be required to determine the extent and location of the associated disease process.

At this time, the place for the new class of antihypertensive drugs, the angiotensin II receptor antagonists, remains uncertain. Currently, they are considered reasonable alternatives for patients who are in dire need of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor but develop a cough while taking this medication.

Patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 110 mm Hg at the end of a 4-week run-in period) were randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with a combination of felodipine and metoprolol tablets (Logimax ), 5/50 mg daily (n = 321), enalapril, 10 mg daily (n = 321), or placebo (n = 304), with the possibility of doubling the dose after 4 or 8 weeks of treatment if necessary ( remaining diastolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg).

A dose adjustment was required in 38% of patients receiving the combination, 63% of patients assigned to placebo, and 61% of patients treated with enalapril. The overall incidence of adverse events was 54.5% during treatment with felodipine-metoprolol; the corresponding values for enalapril and placebo were 51.7% and 47.4%, respectively. Treatment withdrawal due to adverse events occurred in 18 patients treated with the combination, in 10 patients with enalapril, and 12 patients with placebo. No significant changes in patient well-being were observed in any of the three study groups. These results show that a fixed combination of felodipine and metoprolol allows blood pressure to normalize in a substantially higher fraction of patients than enalapril administered alone. This improved efficacy is obtained without compromising tolerability. The fixed-dose combination of felodipine and metoprolol, therefore, may become a valuable option to initiate antihypertensive treatment.",0,0

The evidence for this statement is based on case reports, not research in relevant populations; In the geriatric wards of three Dutch psychiatric hospitals, 195 patients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of major depression (MDD) were studied. In the first week after admission, the following data were recorded: age, sex, personal psychiatric history, family psychiatric history, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, mini-mental state examination, history of stroke, use of medications, and number of different drugs used. Subjects using depressogenic medication were compared with subjects not using depressogenic medication on all variables; There was a significant negative relationship, adjusted for the other variables, between the use of depressogenic medication and a previous admission for depression. No other significant relationships were found between the use of depressogenic medication and etiological variables. Patients with a first admission for MDD use depressogenic medication 2.44 times more than patients with previous admissions for depression.; The use of depressogenic medication is an independent and clinically relevant etiological factor in MDD.",0,0

Drug-induced nocturnal hypotension in patients with chronic hypertension has been associated with precipitation of heart failure and a drop in cerebral blood flow. The authors examined the effects of a single dose and 4-week treatment with different classes of antihypertensive drugs on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in 10 patients with mild hypertension. Data was evaluated by polynomial analysis (Harvard Graphics 3). A single oral dose of enalapril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, carvedilol 25 mg, and celiprolol 200 mg produced a mean 24-hour PSA reduction compared with placebo of, respectively, 24/11, 11/5 , 13/6 and 12/5 mm Hg (p values between <0.02 and <0.001). With enalapril, amlodipine, and carvedilol, between-subject variability contributed significantly to the overall variability of measurements (p-values between 0.05 and 0.01 vs. zero), whereas with celiprolol this was not the case. Although beta blockers lowered blood pressure during the day similar to ACE inhibitor or calcium channel blocker, they did not lower blood pressure at night. These results were confirmed by an 8-week crossover trial comparing enalapril 10 mg daily with celiprolol 200 mg daily in the same group of patients. The authors conclude (1) that beta-blockers produce a more stable reduction in blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension less affected by pressor effects through the sympathetic nervous system; (2) that beta blockers, unlike ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, do not cause nocturnal hypotension in this category of patients; and (3) that the selective beta blocker celiprolol may even work better in these respects than the nonselective beta blocker carvedilol.",0,0

The ACE genotype assigned by an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism is known to affect the potency of ACE inhibitors in various kidney diseases. The authors attempted to clarify whether the effect of ACE inhibitors on restenosis could be modified by ACE genotype. A total of 126 patients were randomly and prospectively assigned to the control group and the imidapril group. In the imidapril group, patients received imidapril 5 mg daily, starting 1 day before PTCA and continuing for 3 to 6 months. Forty-six controls (65 vessels) and 32 imidapril patients (43 vessels) completed the study. The minimum diameter of the lumen before and after the procedure did not differ significantly between the groups with the three genotypes (II, ID and DD) in both the control and imidapril groups. Late lumen loss during the follow-up period was not related to ACE genotype in the control group, but was significantly related in the imidapril group (II, 0.63+/- 0.19 mm; ID + DD, 1, 12+/-0.14mm, p<0.05). Furthermore, in genotype II, imidapril significantly reduced late loss and restenosis rate as defined by most commonly used definitions.

Little information is available to predict which patients are at higher risk for this complication.; To quantify specific clinical predictors of reduced kidney function in patients with congestive heart failure who are prescribed treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; We analyzed data from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of enalapril for the treatment of CHF. There were 3,379 patients randomized to enalapril with a median follow-up of 974 days and 3,379 patients randomized to placebo with a median follow-up of 967 days. Renal function decline was defined as an increase in serum creatinine >/= 0.5 mg/dl (44 micromol/l) from baseline. We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of kidney function decline, including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline creatinine, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of hypertension, diabetes and use of antiplatelets, diuretics. , and beta-blocker therapy.; Patients randomized to enalapril were 33% more likely to have decreased kidney function than controls (p = 0.003). Using multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and enalapril groups, older age, diuretic therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased kidney function, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction high were renoprotective. Older age was associated with an increased risk of developing decreased kidney function in both groups, but significantly more so in the enalapril group (enalapril: hazard ratio [RR] 1.42 per 10 years, confidence interval [CI] 95% 1.32-1.52 with enalapril; placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25). Diuretic therapy was also associated with a higher risk of decreased kidney function in the enalapril group (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.70-2.08) than in the placebo group (RR 1.35, CI 95% 1.09-1.66). In contrast, enalapril had a relative renoprotective effect (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13-1.53) compared with placebo (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.57-2.44) in diabetes patients.

The use of diuretics and older age increased this risk. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of kidney failure in all CHF patients, but this risk was reduced in the enalapril group compared to the placebo group.

Joint National Committee for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.",,"Singh, V; Christiana, J; Frishman, W H","The prevention and treatment of hypertension remain major challenges for clinicians around the world. The recently released sixth report from the Joint National Committee for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI) uses evidence-based medicine to provide guidelines to assist clinicians in the prevention, detection, and treatment of high blood pressure. high blood pressure. , including pharmacological approaches. Calcium antagonists are widely used for the treatment of hypertension, and JNC-VI focuses on specific situations in which calcium antagonists might be considered preferred treatments. There are a large number of calcium antagonists available, with a variety of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic actions. Various sustained-release formulations of these drugs are also available. In terms of blood pressure control, calcium antagonists are more effective as antihypertensive treatments than beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers in black patients. Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. Rate-reducing calcium antagonists can be used as alternatives to beta-blockers in patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension. Calcium antagonists can be used as alternatives to ACE inhibitors in patients with hypertension and concomitant diabetes mellitus and/or kidney disease. Some dihydropyridine calcium antagonists may be useful as alternatives to ACE inhibitors in patients with hypertension and systolic heart failure. Calcium antagonists appear to be extremely useful in patients with cyclosporine-induced hypertension and in patients with hypertension and concomitant Raynaud's phenomenon and/or migraine. Rate-lowering agents can be used in patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias and hypertension. Physicians should be aware of drug interactions involving calcium channel blockers, especially after the recent problems with mibefradil. Although retrospective studies have caused controversy regarding the safety of calcium channel blockers in patients with hypertension, recent prospective studies have revealed no major safety problems with these medications.",0,0

(2) In trials with hypertensive subjects older than 65 years, some diuretics and beta-blockers have reduced the risk of stroke, coronary events, heart failure, and death. In one trial, a diuretic was superior to a beta-blocker for preventive efficacy and adverse effects. Nitrendipine, in combination with other antihypertensive drugs, prevented strokes in one trial. (3) In a trial with hypertensive diabetic patients, captopril and atenolol reduced the risk of stroke, heart failure, and worsening of retinal disease, without preventing coronary events or death.

Collaborative Study Group.,,"Lewis, J B; Berl, T; Bain, R P; Rohde, R D; Lewis, E J","Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease in the United States. We conducted a study to assess the impact of assigning different levels of blood pressure control on the course of type 1 diabetic nephropathy in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. We also examined the long-term course of this well-characterized cohort of patients receiving ACE inhibitor therapy. One hundred twenty-nine patients with type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy who had previously participated in the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition in Diabetic Nephropathy Study and who had a serum creatinine level less than 4.0 mg/dL were randomly assigned to a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 92 mm Hg or less (group I) or 100 to 107 mm Hg (group II). The patients received variable doses of ramipril as the main therapeutic antihypertensive agent. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 2 years. Outcome measures included iothalamate clearance, 24-hour creatinine clearance, creatinine clearance estimated by the Cockcroft and Gault formula, and urinary protein excretion. The mean difference in MAP between the groups was 6 mm Hg during the 24-month follow-up. Median iothalamate clearance in group I was 62 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at baseline and 54 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at end of study compared to baseline of 64 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and final 58 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in group II. There were no statistically significant differences in the rate of decline in kidney function between the groups. There was a significant difference in total urinary protein excretion during follow-up between group I (535 mg/24 h) and group II (1723 mg/24 h; P = 0.02). Thirty-two percent of 126 patients achieved a final total protein excretion of less than 500 mg/24 h. Patients in groups I and II had equivalent rates of adverse events. In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy, the MAP goal should be 92 mm Hg or less for optimal renoprotection, if defined as a reduction in proteinuria. With the combination of ACE inhibition and aggressive blood pressure control, many patients can achieve regression or apparent remission of clinical evidence of diabetic nephropathy.",1,0

Since angiotensin II is known to stimulate the prosclerotic cytokine, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), we postulate that the renoprotective effect may be due to inhibition of TGF-beta1 production. TGF-beta1 levels were measured in serum at baseline and at 6 months from patients in the captopril trial. TGF-beta1 assays were performed on all available patient sera. An analysis was performed between the percentage change in TGF-beta1 levels during the first 6 months versus the percentage change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the following 2 years. TGF-beta1 levels increased by 11% (P=0.003) in the placebo group (n=24), while there was a 14% (P=0.01) decrease in the captopril group (n=34 ). There was an inverse correlation between the percentage change in TGF-beta1 levels during the first 6 months and the percentage change in GFR during the following 2-year period in patients receiving placebo (r = -0.55, P = 0.005 ) and captopril groups (r = -0.45, P = 0.008). In patients with a baseline GFR less than 75 mL/min, there was an even stronger correlation in the percentage change in TGF-beta1 levels and the percentage change in GFR in the placebo groups (n = 9, r = - 0.69, P = 0.03) and captopril (n = 21, r = -0.73, P = 0.0001).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improve autonomic function in patients with AMI, but the circadian pattern of this effect has not been studied. Heart rate variability normalized rate domain indices were assessed 5 days (baseline) after uncomplicated AMI onset and 30 days after therapy with quinapril (n = 30), metoprolol (n = 30 ) or placebo (n = 30) with a solid-state digital Holter monitor. Normal subjects (n=30) were used as controls. Quinapril increased parasympathetic modulation and decreased sympathetic modulation, and improved sympathovagal interactions manifested by an increase in normalized high-frequency power (HFP) and a decrease in normalized low-frequency power (LFP) and its ratio (LFP/HFP ) throughout the 24-hour period (p<0.001), with a maximum effect on the relationship (p<0.0001) between 02:00 and 04:00 am, 08:00 and 11:00 am, and 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. -26%, respectively).

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE or AT1 receptor blockers is effective at VO2 max. We evaluated whether the mechanisms are similar for the 2 drug categories and whether their combination is capable of producing a synergistic effect. Twenty patients with CHF were randomized to receive, in a double-blind manner, placebo + placebo (P+P), enalapril (20 mg/day) + placebo (E+P), losartan (50 mg/day) + placebo (L + P), and enalapril + losartan (E+L) or the same preparations in reverse order, each for 8 weeks. Two patients did not complete the trial. Lung function, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, plasma neurohormones, and quality of life were assessed at the end of each treatment. Compared to P+P, E+P, and L+P, peak VO2 increased similarly (16% and 15%, respectively) and significantly (p < 0.01). Enalapril improved lung function (reduced slope of ventilation versus carbon dioxide production and dead space to tidal volume ratio, and increased alveolar membrane conductance and tidal volume). Losartan probably activated muscle perfusion during exercise (increased work rate delta/VO2 delta, which is a measure of aerobic work efficiency). In combination, they further increased peak VO2 by 10% E+P (p < 0.05) and 11% L+P (p < 0.05).

These changes were significantly greater when the drugs were combined (140 +/- 20 pg/ml for norepinephrine and 5.6 +/- 0.9 ng/dl for aldosterone). The quality of life score did not improve significantly at each step of treatment. Thus, lorsartan and enalapril similarly increased peak VO2 in CHF patients, but the mediators of this effect were, at least in part, different therapeutic targets that may be synergistic when the 2 drugs are combined.",0,0

After a 4-week washout period and a 4-week period of P (4 mg/day) monotherapy, IND (2.5 mg/day) or HCT (25 mg/day) was added for 4 weeks. The selection of the diuretic agent was random. After a 4-week diuretic washout period, in which only P was given, the alternative diuretic was given for another 4-week period. P significantly lowered blood pressure levels. However, the drug was more effective in patients with higher plasma renin activity (PRA). The combined treatment induced a further decrease in blood pressure levels, mainly in patients with lower PRA. The P + HCT combination was more effective than the P + IND combination. The addition of HCT or IND caused a small but statistically significant increase in fasting serum glucose levels, as well as during the 75 g oral glucose challenge.

Small but not statistically significant changes in serum lipid and electrolyte parameters were observed during the various phases of the study, while a statistically significant increase in serum uric acid was noted when the combination P + HCT was administered. We conclude: (1) P in small doses is an effective and safe antihypertensive agent, (2) PRA has a predictive value in determining the effectiveness of P treatment, (3) the combination of P with small doses of HCT or IND is more effective than P alone, (4) the combined treatment has adverse effects on carbohydrate tolerance, while there are no significant changes in serum lipid and electrolyte parameters.",0,0

Microalbuminuric patients were re-studied after 6 weeks of treatment with the ACE inhibitor enalapril, 10 mg once daily. All measurements were made at a blood glucose level of 5 mmol L-1; Transcapillary NaF leakage was strongly increased in normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patients compared to healthy subjects (P < 0.001) and further increased in microalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patients (P < 0.01 compared to normoalbuminuric patients). Enalapril reduced NaF leak (P < 0.05), mean arterial pressure (P < 0.05), and microalbuminuria (P < 0.05). After treatment, NaF loss was not different from that of normoalbuminuric patients; Capillary permeability, determined by NaF leak, is elevated in normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patients with long-standing disease, and excessive elevation in microalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patients improves with ACE inhibition.

However, it is unclear whether low-dose and high-dose ACE inhibitors have similar benefits; We randomly assigned 3,164 patients with New York Heart Association class II to IV heart failure and an ejection fraction < or = 30% to double-blind, low-dose therapy (2.5 to 5.0 mg daily, n = 1596) or high doses (32.5 to 35 mg daily, n=1568) of the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, for 39 to 58 months, while continuing background therapy for heart failure. Compared with the low-dose group, patients in the high-dose group had a nonsignificant 8% lower risk of death (P = 0.128), but a significantly lower 12% risk of death or hospitalization for any reason (P = 0.002) and 24% fewer hospitalizations for heart failure (P=0.002). Dizziness and renal failure were seen more frequently in the high-dose group, but the 2 groups were similar in the number of patients requiring study drug discontinuation. Conclusions: These findings indicate that heart failure patients generally should not be maintained on very low doses of an ACE inhibitor (unless these are the only doses that can be tolerated) and suggest that the difference in efficacy between intermediate doses and discharges from an ACE inhibitor inhibitor (if any) is likely to be very small.",0,0

Whether ACE inhibitor therapy modifies immunological variables has not been previously investigated; Seventy-five patients (mean age 52 +/- 11 years) with CHF were randomized between low-dose (5 mg daily) and high-dose (40 mg daily) enalapril in a double-blind trial. Circulating levels of immunological parameters (ie, proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules) were measured at baseline, 10 weeks, and the end of the study (34 weeks); All immunological parameters except soluble interleukin (IL)-6 receptor were increased in CHF compared to 21 healthy controls. During the study, immunoreactive IL-6 levels decreased (p < 0.05) and soluble IL-6 receptor increased (p < 0.05) during high-dose enalapril treatment, but not during low-dose treatment . Furthermore, IL-6 bioactivity decreased only during the high dose (p < 0.001), resulting in a significant difference in change during treatment between the two dosing groups (p < 0.001). This decrease in IL-6 bioactivity was significantly associated with a decrease in interventricular septal thickness assessed by echocardiography (r = 0.56, p = 0.013). No other variables changed during treatment.; In patients with severe CHF, treatment with high doses of enalapril is associated with a significant decrease in IL-6 activity.

In fact, there are several different ways to assess ACE in vivo: these are serum ACE activity, plasma N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP), urine AcSDKP, angiotensin I plasma (AI), plasma angiotensin II (AII), or the AII/AI ratio; Chronic heart failure patients (n = 39) were randomized to one-week ACEi noncompliance, one-week ACEi compliance, or two one-week partial-compliance versions, after which the above six trials were performed; All six tests significantly distinguished between complete non-adherence for one week and complete or partial adherence. Only AcSDKP plasma produced a significantly different outcome between partial adherence and full adherence or full non-adherence over one week. In terms of its ability to distinguish total nonadherence from total adherence, plasma AcSDKP was 89% sensitive and 100% specific with an area under its ROC of 0.95.

Several studies have suggested that bradykinin (BK) is responsible for ACEi-induced AE, but the mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the metabolism of BK and des-Arg9-BK in the serum of 20 patients with a history of ACEi-associated AE and 21 control subjects (C). Synthetic BK was incubated with the sera for various time periods and residual BK and generated des-Arg9-BK were quantified by sensitive and specific enzyme immunoassays. A significant difference in the half-life (t1/2) of BK and des-Arg9-BK could not be measured between subjects C and AE patients (AE) in the absence of ACEi. However, an analysis according to long (+) or not (-) t1/2 of des-Arg9-BK allowed re-stratification of C subjects and AE patients into four subgroups. Preincubation of sera with enalaprilat at a concentration that inhibited ACE significantly prevented rapid degradation of BK and des-Arg9-BK in these four subgroups. In the presence of ACEi, a subgroup (50%) of AE patients (AE+) had a particularly significant increase in des-Arg9-BK t1/2. Once ACE was inhibited, the concentration or nature of ACEi had no significant effect on des-Arg9-BK t1/2. However, a test dilution of AE+ sera with a control serum (C) showed that an enzyme defect rather than a circulating inhibitor could be responsible for the abnormal metabolism of des-Arg9-BK when ACE is inhibited. In conclusion, half of the patients with AE associated with ACEi present in serum had an enzymatic defect involved in the metabolism of des-Arg9-BK that leads to its accumulation. The B1 agonist could be responsible, at least in part, for the local inflammatory reaction associated with AE.",0,0

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to improve disturbed fibrinolytic balance in hypertensive patients. However, it has not been documented whether this is due to a decrease in the generation of angiotensin II (Ang-II) or a consequence of elevated local levels of bradykinin. Consequently, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of an ACE inhibitor (perindopril) and an Ang-II receptor antagonist (losartan) on fibrinolytic kinetics. We have examined serum levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) antigen and activity, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen and activity, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), and t-PA inhibitor. tissue factor pathway (TFPI) before and after reaching target blood pressure (<140/90 mm Hg) in 13 hypertensive patients receiving perindopril (mean age 40+/-11 years, 6 women, 7 men) and in 12 patients who received losartan (mean age 38+/- 9 years, 6 women, 6 men). We also compared the baseline fibrinolytic activity of hypertensive patients with that of 12 normotensive control subjects (mean age 40+/-9 years, 6 women, 6 men). Mean basal plasma levels of PAI-1 antigen, PAI-1 activity, and sTM were significantly higher in hypertensive patients than in normal controls (p < 0.005). The values of other analytes were similar in both groups. Increased plasma levels of PAI-1 antigen, PAI-1 activity, and sTM were reduced in patients after receiving perindopril and losartan (p < 0.005); the reductions in the losartan group were more pronounced (p < 0.05). There were no significant effects on plasma t-PA antigen levels, t-PA activity, and TFPI in patients receiving the two therapeutic regimens (P > 0.05).

However, compared to conventional therapy, ramipril decreased delta GFR (-52% vs. -19%) and progression to ESRD (-74% vs. -40%) more effectively in women than in men. Therefore, the relative risk (95% confidence interval [CI]) of events (ESRD) between conventional and ramipril treatment was 5.52 (1.59 to 19.17, P = 0.003) in women, but only 1.80 (1.08 to 2.97, P = 0.02) in men This sex-related effect of ramipril was associated with a greater reduction in proteinuria (-7.8 +/- 4.2% vs -21.9 +/- 5.7%, P = 0.05) and remained apparent even after correction for potential confounders such as baseline glomerular filtration rate. , daily sodium intake, dose of ramipril, BP control, and concomitant treatment with diuretics or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (adjusted RR [95% CI]: women, 5.07 [1.26 to 20.38] , P = 0.02, men, 1.44 [0.85 to 2.44], P = 0.17). Ramipril uniformly decreased deltaGFR and incidence of ESRD in women with genotype DD (-39% and -100%) or II + ID (-71% and -82%), and in men (-25% and -50%) with the DD genotype, but had no beneficial effect in men with the II + ID genotype (+18% and +34%).

Again, in parallel with deltaGFR and events, proteinuria decreased in women with genotype DD (-23.3 +/-8.0%) or II + ID (-16.0 +/-9.5%) and in men with genotype DD (-14.8 +/- 7.0%), but did not change in men with genotype II + ID (+1.0 +/- 7.8%).

The purpose of this study was to show the impact of a weight loss intervention on the overall medication requirements for obese and hypertensive patients. This was a substudy of the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study. Patients in the HOT study who had a body mass index > or = 27 kg/m2 were randomized to receive the weight loss intervention, which included dietary advice and group support, or to serve as a control group. The weight of the patients and the number of medication steps (according to the HOT protocol) necessary to achieve the target diastolic blood pressure at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 months were measured. Patients in the weight loss group lost significantly more weight than the control group alone at 6 months (-3.2+/-4.3 v. -1.8+/-2.7 kg [mean + /- SD] for weight loss group versus control, respectively, p = 0.05). The weight loss group tended to regain weight after the first 6 months of the study. However, patients in the weight loss group used significantly fewer medication steps than the control group at all time intervals except 3 months. Weight loss appears to be a useful tool in blood pressure management in patients who require medication to control their blood pressure.",0,0

Patients (n = 28) received ramipril 5 mg daily or placebo for 6 weeks in a double-blind crossover design, followed by 6 months of open-label ramipril treatment. Mental stress (a 20-minute Stroop color word conflict test) and a cold pressure test were performed at the end of each of the three study periods. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded noninvasively. Ramipril reduced resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels (from 146+/-3/99+/-3 with placebo to 135+/-4/94+/-3 at 6 weeks and 136+/-4/ 91+ /-3 mm Hg at 6 months, in the laboratory) and during mental stress. Resting heart rates did not change with ramipril. Ramipril reduced systolic blood pressure and heart rate responses during mental stress; Diastolic blood pressure responses did not change. Ramipril reduced cardiac workload (systolic blood pressure x heart rate) levels and responses. Treatment effects at 6 months were generally greater than at 6 weeks. During the cold test, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were reduced by ramipril, but the responses did not change. However, heart rate responses were reduced. Therefore, ramipril reduced cardiac workload levels and responses also during the cold test. These findings show that ACE inhibitors can reduce cardiac workload during stressful situations. If confirmed, this would appear to offer an advantage in the treatment of hypertension.",0,0

Of note, DeltaGFR (-0.28 +/- 0.07 vs. -0.43 +/- 0.09 mL/min/1.73 m2 per month) and ESRD incidence [14% vs. 36% , P = 0.04, RR (95% CI), 2.62 (1.02 to 6.71)] were lower in ramipril than in conventionally treated patients in genotype DD, but not in genotypes II and ID . In both univariate (P = 0.04) and multivariate (P = 0.01) analyses, ramipril significantly predicted a lower incidence of events in DD patients, but not in II and ID patients. At three months, ramipril decreased proteinuria more effectively in DD (-38.2%) than in genotype II (-26.7%) or ID (-19.2%). In DD (but not II or ID) ramipril-treated patients, a short-term reduction in proteinuria correlated with DeltaGFR throughout the follow-up period (P = 0.02, r = -0.41); In non-diabetic proteinuric nephropathies, the ACE I/D polymorphism does not predict disease progression, but it is a strong predictor of ACE inhibition-associated renoprotection in the sense that proteinuria, delta GFR, and progression a ESRD are effectively reduced in patients with DD, but not in those with genotype II or ID.",0,0

These drugs have not gained wide acceptance in the treatment of hypertension in renal transplant recipients (RTRs) due to the potential for decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate associated with a single kidney and concomitant use of cyclosporine. . Experimental animal models suggest that ACEi may be beneficial in slowing the progression of chronic renal allograft rejection. We performed a retrospective analysis of all TKRs at our institution who had been treated with an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II (AT II) antagonist, with the aim of determining the safety, efficacy, and side effect profile of these drugs. The minimum follow-up was 6 months. One hundred seventy-seven of 642 KTRs were prescribed an ACEi or AT II antagonist. Forty-seven patients discontinued treatment, with cough (8 patients) and hyperkalaemia (6 patients) being the most frequent causes of discontinuation. Mean arterial pressure at each follow-up period was lower than that at the time of initiation of ACE antagonist or AT II therapy, with a decrease from 92 +/- 12 mm Hg to 86 +/- 9 mm Hg (P < 0.05) after 3 years of treatment. Serum creatinine concentrations did not change during the follow-up period. There was a non-sustained increase in baseline serum potassium from 4.4 +/- 0.5 to 4.6 +/- 0.6 mEq/L at 3 months (P < 0.05), but no further increases in potassium beyond this time. The mean hemoglobin concentration for the cohort did not change, but 13 KTRs who received an ACEi for post-transplant erythrocytosis (PTE) had a decrease in hemoglobin of 17.1 +/- 1.0 g/dL at the start of therapy with ACEi at 14.8 +/- 2.2 g/dL at 3 years (P < 0.05). ACEi and AT II antagonists were generally effective antihypertensives and were safe and well-tolerated agents in this KTR cohort. ACEi were also effective in treating PE.",0,0

In 12 patients with stable CAD, we measured coronary sinus blood flow and myocardial oxygen supply and consumption (MVO2) at sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing (30 beats/min above sinus rate), both at control as during infusion of NTG, 1 microg/kg/min, and NTG, 2 microg/kg/min. To study metabolic coronary vasodilation, changes in myocardial oxygen delivery were related to stimulation-induced changes in MVO2 using standard regression analysis. The myocardial oxygen supply/consumption ratio (ie, the slope of the regression line in control, characterizing physiologic metabolic coronary flow regulation) was compared with the ratios obtained during NTG infusion. Compared with control measurements, NTG, 1 microg/kg/min, and NTG, 2 microg/kg/min, attenuated stimulation-induced increases in MVO2 by 29 and 60%, respectively, while flow coronary blood during stimulation remained unchanged. In control, normal regulation of metabolic coronary flow resulted in a myocardial oxygen supply/demand ratio of 1.39 (95% CI, 1.29-1.49). This relationship did not change during NTG, 1 microg/kg/min: 1.44 (95% CI, 1.33-1.56). However, during NTG, 2 microg/kg/min, this ratio increased significantly to 1.84 (95% CI, 1.63-2.05; p<0.01). Intravenous administration of high doses of NTG, an exogenous NO donor, reduces stimulation-induced increases in MVO2 and may increase metabolic coronary vasodilation in patients with CAD.",0,0

There have been isolated case reports suggesting an association between erythroderma and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).; To describe and further characterize the prevalence, etiology, and metabolic sequelae of erythroderma in HIV-positive and -negative patients. In a subset of patients, clinicopathologic correlation was performed.; One hundred thirty-eight consecutive patients were prospectively recruited over a one-and-a-half year period at the King Edward VIII Hospital skin clinic. Demographic, clinical, biochemical and histological data were recorded; Seventy-five percent of the patients were black, 22.5% Indian, and 2.5% white. The male:female ratio was 1.9:1. The mean age was 34.7 years (range, 1 month to 85 years). Forty-three percent of the patients were seropositive, of whom 90% were black. The most frequent causes of erythroderma in the total sample were atopic dermatitis (23.9%), psoriasis (23.9%) and drug reactions (22.5%). The most frequent cause in the HIV-positive group was drug reactions (40.6%), the most frequent being ethambutol (30.8%).

However, the effects of ACEis in patients with an old myocardial infarction and preserved cardiac function have not yet been studied. We examined the effects of 12 months of enalapril therapy in patients with prior MI; Thirteen patients with an old MI and without overt congestive heart failure (CHF), aged 70 +/- 2 years, were treated with enalapril for 12 months. Thirteen age- and sex-matched control patients who had similar medical histories but were not treated with enalapril were also included. Holter electrocardiography and echocardiography were performed at admission and after 12 months of treatment. Heart rate variability, low and high frequency power (LF and HF) and the relationship between LF and HF (LF/HF) were analyzed.

The delta (delta) change in LVESD between endpoint and baseline was inversely correlated with deltaHF (r = -0.56, P < 0.05) and positively correlated with deltaLF/HF (r = 0.65, P < 0.01); Our results suggest possible ongoing structural changes in patients with old myocardial infarction, even in the absence of overt congestive heart failure. Enalapril appeared to prevent such changes and restore cardiac autonomic tone to normal.

Animal studies suggest that bradykinin may play a role in the effects of ACE inhibition on blood pressure and kidney function. Therefore, we compared the renal and hemodynamic effects of a specific intervention on the renin-angiotensin system by blocking the angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 with the effect of ACE inhibition; A randomized, double-blind, crossover trial was conducted in 16 type 1 diabetic patients (10 men), aged 42 years +/- 2 years (mean +/- SEM). The study consisted of five periods, each lasting two months. Patients received losartan 50 mg, losartan 100 mg, enalapril 10 mg, enalapril 20 mg, and placebo in random order. Albuminuria, 24-hour blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were determined at the end of each period; Both doses of losartan and enalapril reduced albuminuria (P < 0.05) and mean arterial pressure (MABP, P < 0.05), while glomerular filtration rate remained stable. Albuminuria was reduced by 33% (95% CI, 12 to 51) with losartan 50 mg, 44% (95% CI, 26 to 57) with losartan 100 mg, 45% (95% CI, 23 to 61) with enalapril 10 mg, and 59% (95% CI, 39 to 72) with enalapril 20 mg, and MABP was reduced by 9 +/- 2, 8 +/- 2, 6 +/- 3, and 11 +/- - 3 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM), respectively. No significant differences were found between the effects of losartan 100 mg and enalapril 20 mg. HbA1C and sodium intake remained unchanged throughout the study, while a significant increase in serum potassium occurred during ACE inhibition; The angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonist losartan reduces albuminuria and MABP in a manner similar to the effect of ACE inhibition. These results indicate that the reduction in albuminuria and blood pressure during ACE inhibition is mainly due to interference with the renin-angiotensin system. Our study suggests that losartan represents a valuable new drug in the treatment of hypertension and proteinuria in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy.",0,0

Mechanisms and management.,,"Cleland, J G","Patients with hypertension are at increased risk of developing heart failure (HF), but the mechanisms by which hypertension leads to HF have not been elucidated [although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is clearly a predictor of increased risk of HF ]. Similarly, although antihypertensive therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of HF in hypertensive patients, it is not known how this benefit occurs, and there is currently no clear evidence that any one class of antihypertensive agent is more effective than any other. in this regard. In theory, beta-blockers would be expected to be ideal agents for HF prevention in hypertensive patients. In addition to blood pressure control and LVH regression, they have clear benefits on morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction (MI), which probably plays an important role in the development of HF in hypertensive patients, and on the prognosis of HF itself. A reduction in long-term mortality after MI has only been shown with non-selective beta-blockers. Carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker that also has other ancillary properties, such as alpha-1 receptor blockade and antioxidant effects and a favorable metabolic profile, may be a suitable option for the prevention of HF in hypertensive patients. This is reinforced by the salutary benefits of carvedilol in reducing the morbidity and mortality of HF itself.",0,0

In a subgroup analysis, baseline PFR was found to be normal (=2.5 EDV/sec) in 12 patients (subgroup A) and impaired (<2.5 EDV/sec) in the remaining 12 (subgroup B). In both subgroups, valsartan and enalapril induced a significant and comparable reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In subgroup A, valsartan and enalapril did not induce significant changes in PFR. In subgroup B, valsartan increased PFR both at rest (from 2.0 +/- 0.3 to 2.4 +/- 0.3 EDV/sec, P < 0.01) and at maximal exercise (from 4.1 +/- 1.1 to 4.4 +/- 1.0 EDV/s, P < 0.05), while enalapril did not change PFR even at rest (2.0 +/- 0.4 EDV/s, P < 0.01 vs. valsartan) or at maximal exercise (3.7 +/- 1.1 EDV/sec, P < 0.05 vs. valsartan); Valsartan-induced renin-angiotensin system blockade is capable of improving LV filling in patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension and impaired diastolic function.

There has been an explosive use of new drugs in both psychiatry and cardiology without widespread knowledge of their possible interactions. The increasing trend toward polypharmacy, the use of psychotropic medications by cardiologists and primary care physicians caring for cardiac patients, and the growth of the aging population present great challenges to the physician. Finally, there is a need to have models/paradigms to predict possible drug interactions, for example, the cytochrome p450 scheme. This article describes a method for identifying, understanding, and coding cardiac and psychotropic drug interactions, a systematic approach to updating this key database, and specific cardiac and psychotropic drug interactions. Specifically, this document 1) details the interactions, 2) addresses the level of their clinical importance, 3) describes the potential mechanisms of the interactions, and 4) provides recommendations to the clinician.

Although these disorders can have a substantial impact on quality of life and may represent significant underlying disease, they are often overlooked by the medical community. Patients may have difficulty recognizing smell versus taste dysfunction and often confuse the concepts of ""taste"" and ""taste."" While the most common causes of impaired smell are nasal and sinus diseases, upper respiratory tract infections, and head injuries, common causes of altered taste include oral infections, oral appliances (eg. , dentures), dental procedures, and Bell's palsy. Medications can interfere with smell and taste and should be reviewed in all patients with reported dysfunction. Additionally, advancing age has been associated with a natural decline in the ability to smell and taste. A focused history and physical examination of the nose and mouth are usually sufficient to detect underlying pathology. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of affected areas, as well as commercially available standardized tests, may be helpful in selected patients.

They were divided into three groups: low (PRA </= 1.5 ng/ml/h, n = 11); normal (1.5 < PRA < 5, n = 14); and high (PRA > 5, n = 13). The effect of ACE inhibition on diuretic-induced natriuresis was then evaluated with respect to renin status; There were no significant differences in age and sex distribution between groups. Plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone serially increased from low to high renin groups, while 24-h urinary sodium concentrations fell from low to high renin groups (low PRA, 96.7 (39. 5); normal PRA, 90.4 (26.7); high PRA, 66.3 (18.9) mmol/L; p = 0.033), despite a higher dose of diuretic in the high-renin group. This blunted natriuretic effect of loop diuretics was caused by RAAS activation, which could be partially reversed by ACE inhibition. ACE inhibitors increased natriuresis by 22% in the high-renin group (p = 0.029), but had no effect in the normal and low-renin groups. Within the low-renin group, five of the 11 patients had persistently low renin levels despite ACE inhibition.

ACE inhibitors did not significantly alter natriuresis in this subgroup of patients and improved natriuresis only in high-renin patients. Thus, there is tentative support for the renin profile in targeting ACE inhibitors to those most deserving, showing that short-term sodium retention does not occur in low-renin patients if ACE inhibitors are withdrawn.

The main objective of the study was to investigate the safety and tolerability of the combination of valsartan and benazepril. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: group 1 received valsartan 160 mg once daily (n = 22); group 2 received valsartan 80 mg once daily plus benazepril 5 or 10 mg once daily (n = 42); group 3 received valsartan 160 mg once daily plus benazepril 5 or 10 mg once daily (n = 44).

Because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can attenuate CCB-induced ankle inflammation, these parameters were evaluated according to a similar design during the combination of amlodipine (10 mg UID) and enalapril (20 mg UID) (n = 10). As a control, the effect of enalapril monotherapy (10 and 20 mg UID for 2 weeks each) was evaluated in a third series of patients (n=8). Amlodipine (5 mg UID) increased leg weight without changing postural vasoconstriction (the percentage decrease in skin blood flow from horizontal to dependent), indicating that extravascular fluid shift was independent of postural vasoconstriction of the skin. However, at 10 mg UID, amlodipine reduced postural vasoconstriction and further increased leg weight, suggesting that autoregulation of skin blood flow limited further fluid transfer. Both parameters normalized after withdrawal of the drug.

The aim of this prospective, randomized study is to compare the effects of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril as first-line treatment on blood pressure, renal function, and urinary albumin excretion in hypertensive patients with ADPKD. Twenty-four ADPKD patients with hypertension with creatinine clearance (Ccrs) greater than 50 ml/min/1.73 m(2) were included in the study. Twelve patients received amlodipine (mean dose, 9 mg/day) and 12 patients received enalapril (mean dose, 17 mg/day). The patients were followed up for 5 years. Baseline mean arterial pressure, which was 109 +/- 3 mm Hg in the amlodipine group and 108 +/- 3 mm Hg in the enalapril group, decreased significantly after 1 year of follow-up (amlodipine, 96 +/- 3 mm Hg). - 3 mm Hg, P < 0.005; enalapril, 89 +/- 2 mm Hg, P < 0.0005) and stable at year 5 (amlodipine, 97 +/- 3 mm Hg, P < 0.0005 versus baseline, enalapril 94 +/- 3 mm Hg, P < 0.005 vs. baseline). scrc, which was 83 +/- 5 ml/min/1.73 m(2) in the amlodipine group and 77 +/- 6 ml/min/1.73 m(2) in the enalapril group, it remained stable after 1 year of follow-up. significantly increased and decreased at year 3 in both groups (amlodipine, 67 +/- 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P < 0.01 versus year 1 and baseline; enalapril, 58 +/- - 4 mL/min/1.73 m (2; P < 0.05 vs. year 1 and P < 0.0005 vs. baseline) no significant change thereafter. No change in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was observed in the amlodipine group (baseline, 68 +/- 21 mg/g; year 1, 52 +/- 21 mg/g; year 5, 148 +/- 74 mg/g). /g), while it decreased significantly in the enalapril group at year 1 (baseline, 23 +/- 4 mg/g; year 1, 13 +/- 3 mg/g; P < 0.05) and remained stable until the end of the study at year 5 (14 +/- 6 mg/g). The researchers concluded that blood pressure was similar in both groups, but only enalapril had a significant effect in maintaining decreased urinary albumin excretion during a 5-year follow-up. Although proteinuria has been considered a surrogate for kidney disease progression, more studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis in ADPKD, since after 5 years no differences in kidney function were observed between the enalapril and amlodipine groups. Compared with ADPKD patients with uncontrolled hypertension, effective blood pressure control, as carried out in the present study, should delay the onset of ESRD by approximately 15 years.",0,0

One hundred twenty-two adult outpatients were randomized to receive valsartan 80 mg or 160 mg, captopril 25 mg, or placebo for 360 days. Changes from baseline to endpoint in plasma lipid parameters were measured. The main criterion for tolerability was the incidence of adverse events. All treatment groups showed minor changes in lipid parameters. Triglycerides increased from 2.7% (valsartan 160 mg) to 9.1% (placebo). Total cholesterol decreased with valsartan 80 mg, while other groups showed increases of up to 0.031 mmol/l. The decreases in total cholesterol (p = 0.018), apolipoprotein B (p = 0.042), and apolipoprotein A1 (p = 0.025) were significant for the comparison of valsartan 80 mg and captopril.

294,10694829,Does Chinese ethnicity affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors?,,"Ding, P Y; Hu, O Y; Pool, P E; Liao, W","Information from clinical and pharmacokinetic studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) comes from subjects who are predominantly male and Caucasian, but the use of ACE inhibitors extends to populations throughout the world. Significant differences between Chinese in general and Caucasian males have been demonstrated in the pharmacokinetics/dynamics of other drug classes that could have implications for the use of ACE inhibitors in the Chinese population. These include: significant Chinese/Caucasian genetic variation in the renin-angiotensin system based on an insertion/deletion (O/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene; genetic determination of plasma ACE activity in the Chinese population; and genetic factors related to the disease substrate that may also influence the response to treatment. Oral and intravenous pharmacokinetic data from several studies of Chinese and Caucasian subjects are available for cilazapril, fosinopril, and perindopril, and pharmacodynamic data are available for eight different ACEIs. Based on these data, there are few differences in the pharmacokinetics of ACE inhibitors between Chinese and Caucasians. Most ACE inhibitors showed good blood pressure lowering efficacy in Chinese (benazepril, enalapril, fosinopril, and spirapril), perhaps with less blood pressure lowering with cilazapril or relatively shorter effect with cilazapril or perindopril compared with Caucasions. . Chinese experience more cough from ACEIs (captopril and enalapril) than Caucasians. The data suggest that fosinopril may not induce cough in as many subjects as other ACEIs, and this appears to be true for the Chinese as well. The mechanism, currently unknown, could involve the dual route of elimination of fosinopril (hepatic and renal). Pharmacokinetic data also support the use of fosinopril in congestive heart failure where elimination pathways may be impaired. In conclusion, ethnic differences between Chinese and Caucasians with respect to ACE and AGT gene polymorphism, which might be expected to affect ACEi action differently in these two ethnic groups, in fact have no such effect. Rather, the differences between ACEIs appear to be more important. Journal of Human Hypertension (2000) 14, 163-170.",0,0

Twenty-six patients were treated with atenolol 50-100 mg and 27 patients with trandolapril 2-4 mg once daily. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests, euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps, and serum lipid measurements were performed after 8 and 48 weeks of active treatment. After 48 weeks, insulin sensitivity was reduced by 23% with atenolol, while it was unchanged during treatment with trandolapril (+0.5%, P = 0.0010 for treatment difference, ANCOVA). The effect on triglycerides (+22% vs. -8.5%) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-13% vs. +0.7%) also differed significantly between atenolol and trandolapril. Results after 8 weeks were similar. Glucose tolerance was not affected by either drug. Atenolol reduced diastolic blood pressure (DBP) better than trandolapril (-15.3 mm Hg vs -6.6 mm Hg for supine DBP after 48 weeks, P = 0.012). The difference in effect on insulin sensitivity between drugs corresponded to 25% of baseline insulin sensitivity values and persisted through 48 weeks of treatment.

296,10696996,Angiotensin II receptor antagonists.,,"Burnier, M; Brunner, H R","Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system began as a way to study the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease with specific pharmacological probes. Oral activity, achieved by shortening the original peptide structures, transformed the probes into therapeutic agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, ACE is a non-specific target to block the renin-angiotensin enzyme cascade. The availability of orally active drugs made ACE inhibition a therapeutic advance, but a more specific blockade always seemed desirable. This goal has now been achieved with orally active angiotensin II receptor antagonists; six are on the market and more are in development. This new class of drugs has the same efficacy as ACE inhibitors, at least in hypertensive patients. Ongoing trials will demonstrate whether angiotensin II receptor antagonists can prevent end-organ damage and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. If they do, these compounds could one day replace ACE inhibitors.",0,0

However, the effects of ACE inhibition on myocardial fatty acid metabolism have not been studied in this patient population. We tested the hypothesis that ACE inhibitor therapy improves myocardial fatty acid metabolism and decreases the mortality rate in patients after AMI; Forty-two patients after a first anterior MI and primary angioplasty were randomly assigned to titrated oral enalapril (n = 24) or placebo therapy (n = 18). Single photon emission computed tomography images were performed with iodine-123-labeled 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) a mean of 4.8 days after AMI and 1 month post-AMI. after AMI.

After a 2-week placebo period, hypertensive patients (diastolic BP 95-115 mm Hg) were randomized to trandolapril 2 mg once daily or captopril 25 mg twice daily for 6 months. Trandolapril and captopril were packaged in electronic pillboxes equipped with a microprocessor that recorded the date and time of each opening (MEMS). Patient compliance was assessed by both standard pill count and electronic monitoring. Blood pressure was measured using a validated semi-automated device at the end of the placebo period and the treatment period. One hundred sixty-two patients entered the study. Compliance data were evaluable for 133 patients (62 in the captopril group and 71 in the trandolapril group). Treatment groups were comparable at baseline except for age (P = 0.046). With the electronic pillbox, overall compliance was 98.9% in the trandolapril group and 97.5% in the captopril group (p = 0.002). The percentage of missed doses was 2.6% in the trandolapril group and 3.3% in the captopril group (p = 0.06). The percentage of late doses was 1.8% in the trandolapril group and 11.7% in the captopril group (p = 0.0001).

At the end of the study, 41% of patients in the trandolapril group and 27% of those in the captopril (NS) group had normalized blood pressure (systolic BP <140 and diastolic BP <90 mm Hg). In this 6-month study, the electronic pillbox allowed for a refined analysis of hypertensive patients' compliance. Patient compliance with trandolapril once daily was greater than with captopril twice daily. The difference between groups is mainly explained by an increase in late doses in the twice daily group.",0,0

Cognitive effects were assessed using tests of attention, visuospatial and verbal memory, learning, reasoning, planning, problem solving, speed, and coordination. Affect was assessed using two different depression rating scales; Perindopril and the diuretic had no adverse effects on various aspects of cognitive function. Mood, as assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory, improved with Perindopril, and the error rate in the motor screening test was lower. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed that both drugs achieved effective 24-hour control; The ease of use and ability to adjust the test level to individual patient requirements, along with the reliability of longitudinal test/retest results, indicate that CANTAB is an important addition to available methods for quantifying the central nervous system. adverse. drug effects The other aim of the study was to assess the adverse cognitive effects of perindopril versus a HT drug that was thought to have no adverse effects on the central nervous system.

Different modalities have been used to prevent contrast-induced nephrotoxicity, namely saline infusion, mannitol, furosemide, calcium channel blockers, atrial natriuretic factor, and dopamine infusion with variable success. The possible role of renin-angiotensin system-mediated spinal cord ischemia in the genesis of contrast-induced nephrotoxicity led us to investigate the role of captopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor containing a sulfhydryl group) in its prevention. Seventy-one diabetes mellitus patients undergoing coronary angiography were included in the study. Patients randomized to receive captopril received the drug at a dose of 25 mg three times a day for three days, starting one hour before angiography, while patients in the control group routinely underwent angiography without receiving captopril. . After angiography, patients in the control group developed a significant increase in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, compared to those receiving captopril. Contrast-induced nephrotoxicity (ie, a 0.5 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine) developed in 29 percent of the control group. Captopril administration reduced the risk of developing contrast-induced nephrotoxicity by 79 percent. Glomerular filtration rate, measured by Tc DTPA renal scan before angiography and 24-72 hours later, demonstrated a mean drop of 9.6 mL/min in the control group, while those in the captopril group had a mean increase of 13 mL/min in glomerular filtration. Velocity. We conclude that renal perfusion abnormalities possibly mediated by the renin angiotensin system are responsible for the development of contrast-induced nephrotoxicity. Administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril offers protection against the development of contrast-induced nephrotoxicity.",0,0

314,10724055,Serum creatinine elevations associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: is it a cause for concern?,,"Bakris, G L; Weir, M R","Reducing the actions of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with ACE inhibitors slows the progression of kidney disease in patients with or without diabetes. Post hoc analyzes of many ACEI-based clinical trials demonstrate the greatest slowing of kidney disease progression in patients with the highest degree of kidney failure at baseline. However, many clinicians do not use ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with renal insufficiency for fear of raising serum creatinine or potassium levels; To determine whether the limited initial reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or elevation in serum creatinine levels, associated with the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, results in long-term protection against decreased of renal function in patients with renal insufficiency; We reviewed 12 randomized clinical trials that evaluated kidney disease progression among patients with pre-existing kidney failure. Six of these studies were multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, and the remainder were smaller randomized studies with a minimum of 2-year follow-up on kidney function. These investigations evaluated patients with and without diabetes or systolic heart failure. The average length of follow-up for all studies was 3 years. Trials were examined in the context of changes in serum creatinine levels or GFR in the group randomized to an ACEI (N = 1102). Sixty-four percent of these individuals (705/1102) had renal function data both before 6 months and at the end of the study; Most trials have shown that patients with preexisting renal insufficiency manifested an acute drop in GFR, an increase in serum creatinine, or both. Those randomized to an ACEI with a serum creatinine level of 124 pmol/L or greater (> or = 1.4 mg/dL) demonstrated a 55% to 75% risk reduction in kidney disease progression in compared with those with normal kidney function randomized to an ACEI. An inverse correlation was observed between the amount of kidney function loss at baseline and the subsequent annual rate of decline in kidney function after randomization to an antihypertensive regimen containing an ACE inhibitor; There is a strong association between acute increases in serum creatinine of up to 30% that stabilize within the first 2 months of ACE inhibitor therapy and long-term preservation of renal function. This relationship is valid for people with creatinine values greater than 124 pmol/L (>1.4 mg/dL). Therefore, discontinuation of an ACEI in such patients should occur only when the creatinine rise exceeds 30% above baseline within the first 2 months of starting the ACEI, or hyperkalemia develops, that is, a serum potassium level of 5.6 mmol/L or greater.",0,0

'Pill-induced' esophagitis is associated with the ingestion of certain drugs and is responsible for many cases of erosive esophagitis. To date, more than 70 drugs have been reported to induce esophageal disorders. Antibacterials such as doxycycline, tetracycline and clindamycin are the offending agents in more than 50% of cases. Other commonly prescribed medications that cause esophageal injury include aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), potassium chloride, ferrous sulfate, quinidine, alprenolol, and various steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. However, many doctors and even more patients are not aware of this problem. Capsules or tablets are often delayed in their passage through the esophagus. Highly caustic coatings, direct drug injury, and poor esophageal clearance of pills can lead to acute inflammation. Esophageal damage occurs when the caustic contents of a drug remain in the esophagus long enough to cause mucosal injury. Taking medication at bedtime or without fluids is a common cause of esophagitis. The possibility of drug-related harm should be suspected in all cases of esophagitis, chest pain, and dysphagia. History and gastrointestinal endoscopy will confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is supportive, although acid reduction is often used as an adjunct.

The incidence of serious adverse events was similar in both groups, although cough occurred less frequently in the losartan group. Captopril failed to prevent an increase in end-diastolic volume and did not influence left ventricular end-systolic volume. This effect led to an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (P<0.001) without a change in wall motion index. Losartan did not affect end-diastolic volume but decreased end-systolic volume (P<0.001), resulting in a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (P<0.001) and a decrease in wall motion index (P <0.001); This study suggests that losartan is safe and well tolerated in patients after myocardial infarction.

ACE inhibitors have been used throughout the world and are generally safe with relatively few side effects. Hypotension may develop with the first dose of captopril and may lead to symptomatic renal hypoperfusion with subsequent acute renal failure (ARF). The case of a 65-year-old patient with congestive heart failure who developed acute renal failure after the first dose of captopril is described. He required hemodialysis for 8 weeks due to improvement in renal function and urine output. Renal biopsy confirmed the presence of acute tubular necrosis. Reversibility of captopril-induced ARF is confirmed and the patient recovered uneventfully. An immunoallergic mechanism is not believed to have been responsible for this adverse effect. Caution is advised when administering ACE inhibitors to elderly patients with congestive heart failure, particularly if they are taking diuretics.

All physicians and community pharmacy owner managers in Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula were asked to participate in the study. Pharmacists who agreed to participate were asked to list patients from participating physicians with prescriptions for (1) furosemide and digoxin with and without an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor inhibitor and (2) an ACE inhibitor. . A pharmacist visited the doctors and asked them if each of their patients receiving digoxin and furosemide was being treated for CHF and if they were identifying more cases of CHF among patients receiving an ACE inhibitor. Physicians in the intervention group received academic details on the use and dosage of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor inhibitors for CHF. Both groups were re-interviewed after three months to establish whether there had been any change in therapy for each patient discussed during the first visit.

344,10798066,Evaluation and treatment of chronic renal failure.,,"Moudgil, A; Bagga, A","Chronic renal failure (CKD) is the irreversible deterioration of kidney function that gradually progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The main causes of CRF include obstructive uropathy, primary glomerular diseases, reflux nephropathy, and hypoplastic or dysplastic kidneys. Progressive hyperperfusion and hyperfiltration lead to increasing glomerular injury and further kidney damage. Symptoms of CRF are usually seen when the GFR is between 10% and 25% of normal. Children with severe CRF often suffer from growth retardation, failure to thrive, acidosis, anemia, and renal osteodystrophy. The management of CKD aims to slow the progression of kidney damage and treat complications related to kidney dysfunction. Suggested measures to slow progression include protein restriction, tight control of hypertension, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and control of hyperlipidemia. Adequate amounts of protein and calories are recommended to avoid growth retardation. Nutritional supplements are often required. The availability of recombinant erythropoietin, calcitriol, and human growth hormone has significantly improved the management of these patients. Once ESRD occurs, renal replacement therapy in the form of chronic peritoneal or hemodialysis and transplantation is necessary.",0,0

In rats, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril crosses the blood-brain barrier and increases dopamine synthesis and release in the striatum. In humans, angiotensin type 1 receptors have been found on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum. In Parkinson's disease, there is a marked reduction in these receptors associated with loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons; We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover pilot study in seven patients to investigate the effect of the ACE inhibitor perindopril on the clinical features of moderately severe Parkinson's disease.; After a four-week treatment period with perindopril, patients had a more rapid onset in their motor response to L-dopa and a reduction in maximum 'in-phase' dyskinesia, p = 0.021 and p = 0.014, respectively. Patients also reported more periods of activity during their waking day in their movement diary, p=0.007.

Therefore, we set out to determine whether the effects of ACE inhibitors on prostaglandin production in essential hypertensive patients are class effects or dependent on ACE inhibitor structure. In addition, we study whether hypertensive patients show an altered ability to synthesize vasodilator prostaglandins. To address these questions, we compared the effects of captopril (sulfhydryl-containing inhibitor), enalapril and ramipril (carboxyl-containing inhibitors), and fosinopril (phosphoryl-containing inhibitor) on blood pressure and urinary excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG ) F1-alpha (the breakdown product of prostacyclin) in 44 subjects with mild to moderate essential hypertension before and 8 weeks after administration of an ACE inhibitor. We also studied prostacyclin excretion in 15 healthy normotensive controls. Urine 6-keto-PGF1-alpha levels (pg/ml) were measured by specific radioimmunoassay. Hypertensive subjects showed lower excretion of 6-keto-PGF1-alpha than normotensive controls (212+/-147 vs 353+/-98 pg/ml, p < 0.001). All ACEIs induced a significant decrease in MAP and increased prostacyclin metabolite excretion rate: C, 211+/-200 to 338+/-250 pg/ml, p < 0.05; E, 202+/-133 to 296+/-207 pg/ml, p < 0.05; R, 205+/-127 to 342+/-211 pg/mL, p<0.05; F, 235+/-128 to 347+/-241 pg/ml, p < 0.05. In hypertensive patients (n = 44), the decrease in blood pressure was negatively correlated with the increase in the excretion of 6-keto-PGF1-alpha (r = -0.51, p < 0.001). These data suggest that impaired prostacyclin biosynthesis in hypertensive patients could explain the hemodynamic changes that lead to the hypertensive state. Furthermore, the hypotensive mechanisms of ACE inhibitors may be mediated by increased prostacyclin production; this effect seems to depend on the class.",0,0
348,10803861,"Losartan: a review of its use, with special emphasis on elderly patients.",,"Simpson, K L; McClellan, K J","Losartan is a selective, orally active, non-peptidic angiotensin receptor subtype 1 (AT1) antagonist. Provides more specific and complete blockade of angiotensin II actions than renin or ACE inhibitors. Short-term clinical trials (up to 12 weeks duration) have shown that losartan is as effective in lowering blood pressure (BP) [causes a decrease in BP < or = 26/20 mm Hg] in elderly patients with hypertension such as the recommended doses of captopril, atenolol, enalapril, felodipine, and nifedipine. In patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), the efficacy of losartan was similar to that of atenolol. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to losartan therapy provides increased antihypertensive efficacy, equivalent to that seen with captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide. Preliminary evidence also indicates that losartan therapy contributes to the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy associated with chronic hypertension. Losartan increases exercise capacity in patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic heart failure. Results from the Losartan Heart Failure Survival or ELITE II study indicate that there was no statistically significant difference between losartan and captopril in reducing deaths overall or in reducing sudden cardiac death and /or resuscitated cardiac arrest in patients with heart failure. Other than ELITE II, there are few conclusive long-term mortality and morbidity data for losartan. Additional long-term trials are currently underway to assess the survival benefits of losartan in elderly patients with hypertension, kidney disease, or after acute myocardial infarction. In elderly patients with hypertension, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events associated with losartan once daily (alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide) [19 to 27%] was similar to felodipine (23%) and nifedipine (21%), however, losartan tended to be better tolerated than captopril (11 vs 16%). Losartan was also better tolerated than atenolol in patients with ISH (10.4% vs 23%). In patients with heart failure, the renal tolerability of losartan was similar to that of captopril, but losartan was associated with a lower rate of withdrawal due to adverse events. No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients or in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction, and the risk of hypotension with the first dose is low.; Comparative data have shown that losartan is as effective as other antihypertensive agents in the treatment of elderly patients with hypertension. Therefore, losartan therapy is a first-line option for all patients with hypertension, particularly those who are poorly controlled or intolerant to their current therapy. Morbidity and mortality data from the Losartan Heart Failure Survival (ELITE II) study show that losartan has potential in the treatment of heart failure.",0,0

However, the impact of the method and the use of standardized power units in long-term ECG monitoring is still debated. Spectral autoregressive and fast Fourier transform (FFT) approaches were applied to assess circadian modulation and the effect of beta-blocker administration in patients with mild hypertension who underwent continuous ambulatory ECG recording (n = 44, 51 + /- 12 years, 30 men). Spectral analysis was applied to 5-minute sequences and representative spectral parameters for each circadian period (24 hours, day, night) were calculated. In the reference logs, the FFT spectral method provided a smaller estimate of the total and very low-frequency powers. In contrast, the low and high frequency components were systematically larger with FFT. Circadian variations favored greater overall nocturnal variability but reduced low-frequency normalized power with both spectral methods. Chronic oral administration of beta-blockers induced an increase in all spectral components except for unchanged low-frequency normalized power, regardless of spectral focus. Despite the quantitative differences, the qualitative assessment of circadian patterns and the effect of beta blockade using autoregressive and FFT-based spectral analyzes is equivalent. The low-frequency component of heart rate variability cannot be considered a reliable direct marker of sympathetic activity on long-term ambulatory ECG recording.",0,0

Twenty-nine patients with renal parenchymal disease and hypertension were enrolled in the prospective, open-label, parallel study that involved a 14-day washout period followed by a 120-day treatment period. Patients were randomized to receive losartan 50-100 mg/day (n = 15) or enalapril 2.5-10 mg/day (n = 14) to achieve blood pressure control <140/90 mm Hg. Blood pressure, hemorrheological profile, and plasma fibrinogen concentration were measured after the washout phase and after 2, 10, 60, and 120 days of treatment. Data were analyzed by ANOVA with repeated measures. Twenty-seven patients completed the study. Treatment with losartan and enalapril was associated with a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in whole blood viscosity at a relatively high shear rate, indicating an increase in blood cell deformability. In patients taking losartan, the increase in blood cell deformability did not result in a decrease in mean whole blood viscosity due to a concomitant significant increase in mean plasma viscosity (P < 0.01). In contrast, enhanced cell deformability in enalapril-treated patients resulted in a small and statistically insignificant decrease in mean whole blood viscosity (P = 0.06; mean change = -0.15 mPa sec). The mechanism of the increased blood cell deformability and increased plasma viscosity associated with losartan remains unclear. It is possible, but not proven, that the improvement in intrinsic blood cell rheology with losartan and enalapril may be the result of changes in cation transport systems and/or the consequence of protective antioxidant properties of drug metabolites. .",0,0

In the perindopril group, diastolic BP decreased by 6 to 7 mm Hg and systolic BP by 10 to 13 mm Hg (both P < 0.01 vs. placebo). These data indicate a substantial placebo response in systolic BP particularly in older hypertensives and indicate the importance of a parallel placebo group to assess the extent of true drug effect.

Previous studies combining short-acting drugs from these classes require multiple doses and have been associated with poor compliance. The availability of long-acting compounds allows for once-daily administration to avoid the inconvenience of multiple daily dosing. It was decided to conduct a double-blind, randomized, crossover study with the long-acting calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the long-acting ACE inhibitor lisinopril, administered alone or in combination in essential hypertension. Twenty-four patients with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 104 mm Hg received amlodipine 2.5 mg and 5 mg, lisinopril 5 mg and 10 mg, and their combination according to a previous randomization schedule. Supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at weekly intervals. Higher doses of both drugs were used individually or in combination if the goal of supine DBP below 90 mm Hg was not achieved. There was a significant additional blood pressure lowering effect with the combination compared to amlodipine or lisinopril alone. Amlodipine 5 mg and lisinopril 10 mg monotherapy achieved target blood pressure in 71% and 72% of patients, respectively.

The incidences of cardiovascular events and drug-related side effects between the two groups were compared to investigate whether both classes of antihypertensive drugs are beneficial in elderly hypertensive patients. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the two intervention groups, except for slightly lower blood pressure (P = 0.08) in the Ca antagonist group at baseline. There were no significant differences in total death between the two groups. Cardiovascular events (both fatal and non-fatal) were observed in 34 of 699 patients (22.5/1000 patient-years) in the ACE-I group and 50 of 1049 patients (19.7/1000 patient-years) in the calcium channel blocker group, with no significant differences found between the two groups. The correlation between cardiovascular incidence and blood pressure achieved during treatment showed a J-shaped phenomenon and suggests that an excessive reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) below 120 mmHg is unnecessary and may be harmful in certain cases. Side effects were more frequent in the ACE-I group than in the Ca antagonist group (p = 0.01). Cough was the main adverse event, occurring in 5.0% of patients in the ACE-I group. In conclusion, the study indicates that both ACE-I (delapril) and calcium channel blocker (manidipine) were equally beneficial in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in elderly hypertensive patients. However, the tolerability of ACE-I was lower due to the adverse event of cough.",1,0

Candesartan cilexetil reduced sitting blood pressure by 17/11 and 19/11 mm Hg after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment, respectively. This reduction was greater (p < 0.01) than with enalapril (12/8 and 13/9 mm Hg) or HCTZ (12/7 and 13/8 mm Hg). The proportions of patients with controlled DBP (< 90 mm Hg) after 12 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil, enalapril, or HCTZ were 60%, 51%, and 43%, respectively. Patients experienced less dry cough (P < 0.001) with candesartan cilexetil or HCTZ than with enalapril. No treatment differences were found in the incidence of dizziness and quality of life was well maintained in all groups. Compared with candesartan cilexetil and enalapril, HCTZ increased serum uric acid and decreased serum potassium (P < 0.001).

Treatment success was defined as maintenance of a diastolic blood pressure of less than 95 mm Hg for at least 1 year. We compared treatment success rates for blood pressure control and adverse effects of placebo versus active treatment. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we also compared placebo versus active drug treatment discontinuation rates over time as a result of adverse drug effects and blood pressure exceeding safe limits; At the end of the titration phase, 58 placebo-treated patients (31%) achieved a target diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg, and 57 (30%) achieved success at 1 year. Older white patients who received placebo had a success rate of 38% versus 23% to 27% for the other age and race subgroups.

Elderly patients are more likely to have comorbid conditions, including dyslipidemia, diabetes, kidney disease, atherosclerosis, and, in men, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Therefore, when choosing an antihypertensive agent for elderly patients, it is particularly important to ensure that the treatment does not exacerbate comorbid conditions and does not detrimentally interact with any concomitant medications the patient is taking. The alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist doxazosin has been shown to be an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive treatment in elderly male patients and does not exacerbate, and in some cases improve, some other common disorders. Doxazosin has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of BPH in elderly patients whose blood pressure is well controlled on concomitant antihypertensive medication. In addition, improvements in BPH symptoms, as well as reductions in blood pressure, have been seen in older men with mild to moderate hypertension. Doxazosin has been shown to have positive effects on lipid profiles and glycemic control, making it an attractive treatment option for elderly patients with hypertension and diabetes or dyslipidemia.

366,10830252,Risk-benefit ratio of angiotensin antagonists versus ACE inhibitors in end-stage renal disease.,,"Sica, D A; Gehr, T W; Fernandez, A","Effective treatment of hypertension is an extremely important consideration in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Virtually any class of drug, with the possible exception of diuretics, can be used to treat hypertension in the ESRD patient. Despite such a wide range of treatment options, drugs that disrupt the renin-angiotensin axis are generally suggested as the agents of choice in this population, although evidence supporting their preferential use is quite scant. ACE inhibitors and, more recently, angiotensin antagonists, are the 2 classes of drugs most commonly used to alter the activity of the renin-angiotensin axis and thus control blood pressure. The use of ACE inhibitors in patients with ESRD can sometimes be a demanding proposition. ACE inhibitors are variably dialyzed, with compounds such as catopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and perindopril undergoing substantial clearance between dialyzers during a standard dialysis session. This phenomenon makes the selection of a dose and timing of ACE inhibitor administration a complex issue in patients with ESRD. In addition, ACE inhibitors are recognized to have a variety of nonpressor effects that are relevant to patients with ESRD. Such effects include its ability to decrease the thirst drive and to decrease erythropoiesis. Furthermore, ACE inhibitors have a unique adverse effect profile. As occurs with its use in patients without renal insufficiency, the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with ESRD may be accompanied by cough and less frequently by angioneurotic edema. In the ESRD population, the use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with so-called anaphylactoid dialyzer reactions. Angiotensin antagonists are similar to ACE inhibitors in their mechanism of lowering blood pressure. Angiotensin antagonists are not dialyzable and can therefore be distinguished from various ACE inhibitors. Furthermore, the adverse effect profile of angiotensin antagonists is remarkably mild, with cough and angioneurotic edema occurring rarely, if ever. In patients with ESRD, angiotensin antagonists are also not associated with the anaphylactoid dialyzer reactions that occur with ACE inhibitors. The non-pressor effects of angiotensin antagonists, such as influence on thirst drive and erythropoiesis, have not been explored in depth, as has been done with ACE inhibitors. Although ACE inhibitors have not been directly compared with angiotensin antagonists in patients with ESRD, angiotensin antagonists have a number of pharmacokinetic and adverse effect characteristics that would favor their use in this population.",0,0

The present study was designed to assess whether a treatment based on a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist or an ACE inhibitor could reduce carotid artery wall hypertrophy through a reduction in carotid PP rather than by reducing carotid artery wall hypertrophy. mean BP and whether the influence of local PP reduction could also be detected at the site of a muscular artery, the radial artery.; Ninety-eight essential hypertensive patients were randomized to 9 months of double-blind treatment with celiprolol or enalapril. Arterial parameters were determined with high-resolution echo-monitoring systems. PP was measured locally with applanation tonometry and independently of mean BP. After 9 months of treatment, mean BP, carotid PP, and intima-media thickness (IMT) decreased significantly, with no differences between the 2 groups. Reduction in carotid PP, but not mean BP, was an important independent determinant of carotid IMT reduction. The IMT and the PP of the radial artery decreased significantly with both treatments. However, the reduction in radial artery IMT was not related to changes in radial artery PP; Regression of carotid artery wall hypertrophy during long-term antihypertensive treatment depended on local PP reduction rather than mean BP reduction. The effect of PP reduction on IMT reduction was observed at the site of an elastic artery but not at the site of a muscular artery.",0,0

Aspirin inhibits the synthesis of vasodilator prostaglandins and, in principle, this inhibition could antagonize some of the effects of ACEi. But it is unclear whether this influences the effects of ACE inhibitors on mortality and major morbidity after MI in practice; This overview sought individual patient data from all trials involving more than 1000 patients randomized to receive ACE inhibitors or control starting in the acute phase of MI (0-36 hours from onset) and continuing for four to six weeks. Data on concomitant ASA use were available for 96,712 of 98,496 patients in four eligible trials (and for none of the 1556 patients in the other eligible trial); Overall 30-day mortality was 7.1% among patients assigned to ACE inhibitors and 7.6% among those assigned to control, corresponding to a proportional reduction of 7% (standard deviation [SD], 2% ) (95% confidence interval from 2 to 11%, p = 0.004).

372,10842896,The role of angiotensin II receptors and their antagonists in hypertension.,,"van Zwieten, P A","The octapeptide angiotensin II is the main effector of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Angiotensin II causes a variety of potentially deleterious biological effects, including vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure, aldosterone release, potentiation of the effect of catecholamines, and vascular and myocardial hypertrophy, including cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction. All of these deleterious effects of angiotensin II are mediated by angiotensin II receptors (AT receptors) of the AT1 subtype. The functional effects of AT2 receptors, which have been characterized by biochemical techniques, have not been clearly identified so far. Stimulation of the AT2 receptor by angiotensin II is thought to counteract vascular/myocardial remodeling and possibly induce vasodilation. Consequently, AT1 and AT2 receptors are thought to cause opposite effects. It has drawn attention that fetal tissues contain a high density of AT2 receptors, which is significantly reduced after birth. Identification and analysis of AT receptors have been greatly stimulated by the development of non-peptidergic AT1 receptor antagonists, of which losartan is the prototype. So far it is not clear whether AT receptors are activated in hypertensive disease. A study will be made of the hemodynamic effects of AT1 receptor antagonists, their interaction with AT receptors and the probably important role of the sympathetic nervous system involved in the antihypertensive action of AT receptor antagonists.",0,0

In this study, we prospectively investigated the main clinical determinants of progression and response to treatment in the 352 patients included in the REIN study. The mean DeltaGFR (0.56 +/- 0.05 [SEM] versus 0.21 +/- 0.05 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/month; P = 0.0001) and the incidence of ESRD (30% and 10%; P = .0001) were more than twice as high in patients with proteinuria of 2 g/24 h or more than protein compared with those with less than 2 g/24 h of protein (relative risk [RR], 4.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.20 to 7.52), as well as in patients with hypertension compared with normotension (mean DeltaGFR, 0.48 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.22 +/- 0.05 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/mo, P = 0.0006, ESRD, 25% vs. 10%, P = 0.004, RR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.38 to 7.32).

In summary, patients with proteinuria of 2 g/24 h or more protein, preexisting hypertension, or type 2 diabetes progressed faster. Higher blood pressure and the degree of proteinuria were the strongest determinants of a more rapid decline in GFR. The renoprotective effect of ramipril was similar in normotensive and hypertensive patients. Hypertensive patients and those with proteinuria of 2 g/24 h or more of protein, primary glomerular disease, or nephrosclerosis benefited more from treatment with ACE inhibitors.

High-dose lisinopril was more effective than low-dose lisinopril in reducing the risk of major clinical events in heart failure patients treated for 39 to 58 months. Compared with those who received low doses, those who received high doses of lisinopril had an 8% lower risk of all-cause mortality (p = 0.128), a 12% lower risk of death or hospitalization for any reason (p = 0.002) and 24% fewer hospitalizations for heart failure (p = 0.002). These benefits were associated with significant cost savings. In short-term (generally 12-week duration) multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized clinical trials, lisinopril was significantly more effective than placebo and was at least as effective as captopril, enalapril, digoxin, and irbesartan to improve final symptoms. points and clinical status in patients with heart failure. Lisinopril is generally well tolerated by patients with heart failure. In controlled clinical trials, the most common adverse events that occurred in recipients of the drug were dizziness, headache, hypotension, and diarrhea. The overall adverse event profiles for patients treated with high and low doses of lisinopril in the ATLAS study were similar. However, the high doses of lisinopril used in the ATLAS study were associated with a higher incidence of adverse events, importantly hypotension and worsening renal function; however, these events were generally well managed by altering the dose of lisinopril or concomitant medications. Furthermore, despite the higher incidence of some adverse events with high-dose lisinopril, the frequency of treatment discontinuations due to adverse events was the same in the high- and low-dose groups; Lisinopril (when added to diuretics and/or digoxin) provides symptomatic benefit in patients with congestive heart failure. The ATLAS study showed that high doses of lisinopril significantly reduced the risk of the combined morbidity and mortality endpoint compared with low doses of the drug. Importantly, there was no clinically significant decrease in drug tolerability with the use of a high dose. Lisinopril is at least as effective and as well tolerated as other members of the ACE inhibitor class for the treatment of congestive heart failure.",0,0

Of the 30 patients, 13 (4 with genotype II and 9 with genotypes ID and DD) were randomized to HT (enalapril or metoprolol) during the study. ACE genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction. Glomerular structural changes were measured by stereological methods.; Of the patients, 8 had genotype II, 19 had genotype ID, and 3 had genotype DD. During the study, basement membrane thickness, womb stellate volume, and overall index of diabetic glomerulopathy increased only in patients with ID and DD genotypes (P < 0.001, P = 0.01, P < 0.001, respectively). Among those with ID and DD genotypes, the progression of basement membrane thickening and the index of diabetic glomerulopathy were increased in those without hypertension, compared with patients treated with antihypertensives (P < 0.001, P = 0.02, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, the ACE genotype had an independent influence on the progression of basement membrane thickening (P = 0.01), when HBP (P < 0.001) and mean HbAlc during the study were also taken into account ( P < 0.001). The ACE genotype tended to be independently associated with the diabetic glomerulopathy index (P = 0.05); Microalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patients who carry the D allele have a greater progression of diabetic glomerulopathy. The presence of this allele and the absence of AHT seems to enhance this process. Larger studies are needed to confirm the clinical importance of our findings.",0,0

Five patients had a classic X-linked form of the disease; two brothers had the autosomal recessive variant. His age was between 5.15 and 13.75 years when enalapril was started. All patients had hematuria and proteinuria, creatinine clearance was >80 mL/min per 1.73 m2 in all, and only one patient was hypertensive. The initial dose of enalapril (0.1 mg/kg body weight per day) was increased progressively according to individual clinical tolerance. Median doses were 0.13, 0.12, 0.21, and 0.29 mg/kg at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively. Median mean arterial pressure values were 95 mmHg at baseline and 84 mmHg after 24 months. Median daily proteinuria decreased from 52 mg/kg to 18 mg/kg at 6 months, 21 mg/kg at 12 months, 12 mg/kg at 18 months, and 30 mg/kg at 24 months. Serum creatinine increased over time from a median of 0.64 mg/dl at baseline to 0.77 mg/dl at 24 months.

A predetermined protocol defined the scope of the study, the comparators (candesartan, losartan, valsartan, and irbesartan), and the inclusion criteria for the peer-reviewed data. Data on the clinical efficacy of the comparators, measured as the reduction (mmHg) achieved in sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) achieved, were extracted, statistically evaluated and reported. The combinability of data from different clinical trials was confirmed by analysis of variance. A pharmacoeconomic model was developed by combining these clinical results with South African retail prices and testing the results at the 95% confidence level; A significant difference in clinical efficacy was found between comparators, with the following mean reductions in PADS observed: candesartan 10.57, irbesartan 9.07, losartan 8.89, and valsartan 7.11 mmHg. Candesartan was found to be significantly more effective than losartan. Valsartan was found to be less effective than the other 3 comparators. No significant differences were found between irbesartan and candesartan or losartan. The reduction in SDBP per R100 spent indicated that candesartan was more cost-effective than the other comparators, among which there were no significant differences. Private healthcare payers could achieve incremental savings of R5.0 million per year per 100,000 patients successfully treated using candesartan; There are significant differences in the clinical and cost-effectiveness measures used in this study for the comparators.

Several clinical trials have shown that AT-II receptor antagonists are as effective as calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and induce fewer adverse effects. Adverse effects of AT-II receptor antagonists (dizziness, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, and gastrointestinal disturbances) occur at about the same rate as placebo. [corrected]. All available AT-II receptor antagonists appear to be equally effective in lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure and are of comparable cost.

407,10904023,Effect of the angiotensin II antagonist eprosartan on activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system induced by hyperglycemia in healthy humans.,,"Osei, S Y; Price, D A; Laffel, L M; Lansang, M C; Hollenberg, N K","We previously reported that hyperglycemia in healthy human subjects increased the renal vasodilator response to captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. This observation raised interesting possibilities relevant to the pathogenesis of kidney disease in patients with diabetes mellitus. To determine whether the effect of captopril was actually mediated by a reduction in angiotensin II (Ang II) formation, we conducted another study in which an Ang II antagonist, eprosartan, was used instead of captopril. Nine healthy subjects with high sodium balance (ie, sodium intake of 200 mmol/d) were studied. On the first day, subjects received 600 mg of eprosartan orally, and renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured. Glucose was infused intravenously on the second and third days of the study to increase plasma glucose to a level below the threshold for glucosuria (approximately 8.8 mmol/L). Eprosartan at a dose of 600 mg or placebo was randomly administered on the second or third study day 1 hour after the start of the glucose infusion. RPF increased (by 76+/-7 mL. min(-1). 1.73 m(-2), P<0.01) in response to sustained moderate hyperglycemia and then increased further (by 147+/-15 mL min(-1) 1.73 m(-2), P<0.01) when eprosartan was administered during hyperglycemia. In contrast, eprosartan did not affect RPF or GFR in normoglycemic subjects. GFR was not affected by hyperglycemia or by eprosartan. Neither plasma renin activity nor plasma Ang II concentration changed during hyperglycaemia, suggesting that the hormonal responses responsible for the increased renal vasodilatory response to eprosartan occurred within the kidney. The increased renal vasodilator effect of eprosartan during hyperglycaemia is consistent with activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system.",0,0

The patients received the drugs for 10 months; All three therapeutic regimens were equally effective in reducing blood pressure and left ventricular mass index (LVMI, g/m2): 141+/-3.9 to 123+/-3.6 in the enalapril group (p< 0.05), from 147+/-3.8 to 133+/-2.8 in the losartan group (p<0.05), and from 146+/-3.0 to 116+/-4.0 in the enalapril+losartan group (p<0.05). However, the percentage reduction in LVMI was significantly higher (p<0.01) in the enalapril+losartan group (20.5+/-5.0%) than enalapril (12.4+/-3.2 %) and losartan (9.1+/-2.1%) groups. LVMI normalization was obtained in 10 of the 16 patients who received enalapril + losartan, in 6 of the 15 patients who received enalapril alone, and in 4 of the 15 patients treated with losartan; The combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (AT1 receptor antagonist) in patients produced an additional effect in reducing left ventricular hypertrophy.

Approximately 5 million Americans have the disease, with 400,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Despite a better understanding of its pathophysiology, therapeutic options remain suboptimal, and the syndrome remains associated with high hospitalization rates and lost economic productivity. Treatment traditionally included vasodilators, diuretics, and digoxin, with a focus on symptom control and improvement of ejection fraction and exercise capacity. Drug therapy is now focused on improving survival, with a reduction in health care costs related to hospitalizations. Drugs with proven benefit in reducing morbidity and mortality include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and the combination of hydralazine plus a nitrate.

Two hundred twenty-nine hypertensive patients were randomized in a double-blind, parallel-group study. After a 3-week placebo period, they received 2 mg trandolapril or 50 mg losartan once daily for 6 weeks. At the end of the placebo and active treatment periods, three methods of blood pressure measurement were used: a) office blood pressure (three consecutive measurements); b) home self-monitoring of blood pressure (PABE), which consists of three consecutive measurements taken at home in the morning and at night for 7 consecutive days; and c) ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM), 24-h BP records with three measurements per hour. Of the 229 patients, 199 (87%) had at least 12 valid ABPM measurements during the treatment and placebo periods, while only 160 (70%) had good quality 24-hour ABPM recordings during both periods (p < 0.0001). One hundred and forty patients performed well on all three measurement methods. At baseline and with treatment, the agreement between office measurements and ABPM or ABPM was weak. On the contrary, there was a good agreement between ABPM and SBPM. The mean difference (SBP/DBP) between ABPM and ABPM was 4.6 +/- 10.4/3.5 +/- 7.1 at baseline and 3.5 +/- 10.0/4, 0 +/- 7.0 at the end of the treatment period. The correlation between ABPM and ABPM expressed by the coefficient r and P values was as follows: baseline 0.79/0.70 (<0.001/<0.0001), with active treatment 0.74/0.69 (0. 0001/0.0001). Hourly and 24-hour reproducibility of blood pressure response was quantified using the standard deviation of the BP response. Compared to office blood pressure, global and hourly SBPM responses exhibited a lower standard deviation. The hourly reproducibility of the ABPM response (10.8 mm Hg/6.9 mm Hg) was less than the hourly reproducibility of the ABPM response (15.6 mm Hg/11.9 mm Hg). In conclusion, SBPM was easier to perform than ABPM. There was good agreement between these two methods, while the agreement between LMBS or ABPM and office measurements was weak. Given that the hourly reproducibility of the response of the SBPM is better than the reproducibility of the response of the hourly ABPM and of the office BP, the SBPM seems to be the most appropriate method to evaluate the residual antihypertensive effect.",0,0

The aim of this study was to test whether quinapril can interrupt this process and to analyze possible mechanisms. Of 138 patients with a mean age of myocardial infarction of 56 months, 25 had asymptomatic progressive LV dilatation and were randomized in a double-blind prospective study to receive either placebo or quinapril. At baseline (mean +/- SEM) ejection fraction was reduced (35 +/- 3% and 39 +/- 3%) and end-diastolic volume (gated single photon emission computed tomography) increased (104 +/- 9 and 117 +/- 12 ml/m(2)) with placebo (n = 13) and quinapril (n = 12), respectively.

Wedge pressure during cycling exercise was similar at baseline, but at 12 months tended to be lower with quinapril (17 +/- 1 mm Hg) than with placebo (24 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = 0, 1673). Thus, quinapril prevented further progression of asymptomatic LV dilation and remodeling after remote myocardial infarction, possibly due to attenuation of an exercise-induced increase in LV filling pressure.",0,0

Patients with moderate or severe hypertension, currently treated with at least two single-agent drugs (excluding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 mm Hg, and at least one drug-related undesirable symptoms were randomized to once-daily treatment with one of the combinations for 12 weeks. Losartan/HCTZ reduced sitting DBP from prior treatment baseline by 13.7 mm Hg and sitting systolic blood pressure by 19.3 mm Hg; Similar reductions occurred with enalapril/HCTZ. Sitting DBP was reduced to normal levels (< 90 mm Hg) in 63% of patients who switched to the losartan combination and in 58% of those treated with the enalapril combination. Each combination was associated with better tolerability compared to previous therapy, although fewer patients reported each of the 24 undesirable symptoms after 12 weeks of losartan/HCTZ. The improvement in cough development over prior treatment was significantly greater with losartan/HCTZ (p = 0.005). Enalapril/HCTZ, but not losartan/HCTZ, increased serum uric acid levels at week 12.

Results from large double-blind randomized studies (n > 100) in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hypertension demonstrated that the antihypertensive efficacy of eprosartan (generally 400 to 800 mg/day as a single daily dose or in 2 divided doses) is significantly elder. better than placebo and at least as good as enalapril. In placebo-controlled trials, eprosartan achieved mean reductions from baseline in trough sitting systolic blood pressure from 6.3 to 15 mm Hg and in diastolic blood pressure from 4.1 to 9.7 mm Hg. Response rates associated with once daily administration of 400 to 800 mg of eprosartan were approximately twice that of placebo. Eprosartan was generally well tolerated with a similar tolerability profile to placebo. In comparative trials, where the incidence of persistent dry cough was assessed as the primary endpoint, enalapril was several times more likely to induce this adverse event than eprosartan (the difference was statistically significant regardless of study population and age). definition of cough). . In conclusion, the angiotensin II receptor antagonist eprosartan is an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive agent that is administered once or twice daily without regard to meals. Eprosartan has a low potential for serious adverse events and the drug has not been associated with clinically significant drug interactions. Unlike ACE inhibitors such as enalapril, eprosartan does not have a high propensity to cause persistent nonproductive cough. Therefore, eprosartan represents a useful therapeutic option in the management of patients with hypertension.",0,0

Prevention of atherosclerosis with ramipril.",,"MacMahon, S; Sharpe, N; Gamble, G; Clague, A; Mhurchu, C N; Clark, T; Hart, H; Scott, J; White, H","The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, on carotid atherosclerosis in patients with coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease.; Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of coronary events in various patient groups and prevent the development of atherosclerosis in animal models. It has been hypothesized that the clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors may therefore be mediated through effects on atherosclerosis; Six hundred seventeen patients were randomized equally to ramipril (5-10 mg daily) or placebo. At baseline, two years and four years, carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by B-mode echocardiography and left ventricular mass was assessed by M-mode echocardiography; Blood pressure (BP) was reduced by a mean of 6 mm Hg systolic and 4 mm Hg diastolic in the ramipril group compared to the placebo group (p<0.001). There was no difference between groups in changes in common carotid artery wall thickness (p = 0.58) or carotid plaque (p = 0.93). Left ventricular mass index decreased by 3.8 g/m2 (4%) in the ramipril group compared to the placebo group (2p = 0.04); The results do not support the hypothesis that reduction in atherosclerosis is responsible for the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on major coronary events. The benefits are more likely due to lower BP, reduced left ventricular mass, or other factors, such as reversal of endothelial dysfunction.",0,0
425,10933569,Intermediate but not low doses of aspirin can suppress cough induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Tenenbaum, A; Grossman, E; Shemesh, J; Fisman, E Z; Nosrati, I; Motro, M","This self-matched control study aimed to compare the efficacy of two different active treatment regimens: low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily) versus intermediate-dose aspirin (500 mg daily) in eliminating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough ( ACEI). A dry, nagging cough is the most common side effect of all angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Prostaglandins (PGs) have been reported to play a major role in the genesis of ACE inhibitor-associated cough. The role of different doses of the most widely used PG inhibitor, aspirin, in modifying ACE inhibitor cough has not yet been elucidated. Of 350 consecutive ACEI-treated patients, we identified 34 (9.7%) non-smokers with ACEI-related cough. Patients with lung disease, treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and those who did not agree to participate in the study were excluded. In the remaining 14 ACE inhibitor cough patients (eight men, six women; mean age, 63 +/- 11 years), treatment was discontinued; dry cough completely disappeared but returned in all patients within 1 week after reintroduction of ACEIs. At the end of the rechallenge period, patients were started on low-dose aspirin for 1 week and then switched to medium-dose aspirin for an additional week. Cough severity (CS, 0-4) and frequency (FC, 0-10) scores were recorded at each visit. Low-dose aspirin was ineffective in suppressing ACE inhibitor-induced cough, while medium-dose aspirin completely eliminated cough in five patients and reduced it in all but one; CS and CF decreased, respectively, from 2.5 +/- 1.0 to 0.9 +/- 1.1, P < 0.002, and from 6.6 +/- 2.4 to 2.4 +/- 1 .1, P < 0.0002. Overall, intermediate-dose aspirin beneficially modified cough scores in 13 (93%) patients, allowing nine (64%) to continue ACEI treatment. Aspirin did not influence blood pressure control in hypertensive or postinfarction patients. We conclude that intermediate but not low doses of aspirin can probably suppress ACEI-induced cough. These findings propose a new alternative therapeutic approach for patients with ACE inhibitor-related cough, especially those in whom ACE inhibitor therapy appears to be essential.",0,0

Recent European guidelines point to a great deficiency in our knowledge on how to treat chronic diastolic heart failure and a lack of information on the treatment of heart failure in the elderly in general; The objectives of this trial are to assess the potential benefits of the ACE inhibitor perindopril for treating chronic heart failure in older people, in the absence of significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction.; One thousand people over the age of 70 will be recruited into this study. Evidence of chronic heart failure will be confirmed by clinical criteria and echocardiography; Once the diagnosis of chronic heart failure is confirmed, the patient will receive perindopril or placebo in addition to their usual treatment. The primary outcomes are death and unplanned hospitalizations related to heart failure. Quality of life, measured by the Guyatt questionnaire, will be assessed at the beginning of the study and after 1 year. Substudies of this trial include a 6-minute walk test and a more detailed assessment of ventricular function (assessed by echocardiography).

Thirty-two patients (23 men and 9 women) with mild to moderate symptoms of heart failure (NYHA II-III) and a mean age of 49 years were included in the investigation. Patients were investigated with Doppler echocardiography before treatment, after 3 and 6 months of treatment (either metoprolol or captopril), and 1 month after discontinuation of treatment. Intra- and inter-investigator reproducibility was acceptable, with a coefficient of variation of less than 5% for LV dimensions. A reduction in LV dimensions was observed in both treatment groups. In the metoprolol group there was also an increase in LV stroke volume and fractional shortening. Noninvasive data were in agreement with invasive measurements of stroke volume and LV filling pressure.

446,10981547,Amlodipine is comparable to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for long-term renoprotection in hypertensive patients with renal dysfunction: a one-year prospective randomized study.,,"Kumagai, H; Hayashi, K; Kumamaru, H; Saruta, T","Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), few long-term studies have shown that calcium antagonists slow the progression of renal dysfunction. Our objective was to prospectively compare the effects of amlodipine and ACE inhibitors (enalapril) on renal function in hypertensive patients with renal failure due to chronic glomerulonephritis and essential hypertension. A total of 72 hypertensive patients with serum creatinine (Cr) > 1.5 mg/dL were randomly assigned to treatment with any of the drugs. Over a 1-year period, 33% of ACEi-treated patients dropped out due to adverse events, while 9% of amlodipine-treated patients dropped out. Data from 28 patients were available for analysis for more than 1 year of follow-up. Blood pressure reductions were comparable between the amlodipine (165/101 to 138/81 mm Hg) and ACE inhibitor groups. Serum Cr increased from 2.1+/-0.8 (SD) to 2.6+/-1.0 mg/dL with amlodipine (n = 16), but the difference was equivalent to that with ACE inhibitors (n = 12). Creatinine clearance (Ccr) in the moderate dysfunction group (baseline Cr, 1.5 to 2.0 mg/dL) changed from 36+/-10 to 33+/-11 mL/min (not significant) with amlodipine , and the change was similar to what he noted with ACEI. The annual decreases in Ccr with amlodipine (-3.7 ml/min/year) and ACE inhibitors (-2.6 ml/min/year) were comparable, and both tended to be less than the annual decrease in glomerular filtration rate. reported in the Modification of Diet in Kidney Disease Study (-6 mL/min/year). Serum potassium increased significantly (P < 0.01), from 4.5+/-0.4 to 5.3+/-0.8 mEq/L, in the ACEI group only. This 1-year prospective study showed that the effect of amlodipine on renal function is probably the same as that of ACE inhibitors. Furthermore, amlodipine was better tolerated than ACE inhibitors in hypertensive patients with renal dysfunction.",0,0

Candesartan researchers from the UK and Israel.,,"MacGregor, G A; Viskoper, J R; Antonios, T F; He, F J","This multicenter study evaluated the efficacy of candesartan cilexetil, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, used alone or in combination with amlodipine or in combination with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension. After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, patients entered a 12-week open-label dose-titration period. The dose of candesartan cilexetil was increased from 8 mg to 16 mg once daily; Amlodipine (5 mg once daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once daily), and additional medication were also added sequentially if needed. Patients then entered a final 4-week, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled withdrawal period of candesartan alone. A total of 216 patients were recruited. After a 2-week run-in period with placebo tablets, mean sitting blood pressure (BP) was 175/108 mm Hg. At the end of the 12-week dose titration/maintenance period, mean sitting BP fell to 141/88 mm Hg. In 67 patients who were randomized to placebo and had candesartan withdrawn, there was a highly significant increase in mean systolic/diastolic BP (13/6 mm Hg) compared with patients who continued candesartan (ANCOVA, P: < 0.0001). In conclusion, candesartan cilexetil is an effective blood pressure lowering drug when used alone or in combination with amlodipine or amlodipine plus hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of moderate to severe essential hypertension.

It is not known whether the new class of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is similarly affected. We conducted a multicenter study to evaluate the effect of indomethacin on the antihypertensive effects of losartan and captopril. After 4 weeks of placebo washout, hypertensive patients received 6 weeks of active antihypertensive treatment with losartan 50 mg once daily (n=111) or captopril 25 mg twice daily for 1 week, which was increased to 50 mg twice daily for 5 weeks (n=105). This was followed by 1 week of concomitant indomethacin therapy (75 mg daily). The primary outcome measure was the change in mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure after the addition of indomethacin. Both captopril and losartan significantly reduced ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (losartan -5.3 mm Hg, P: <0.001; captopril -5.6 mm Hg, P: <0.001) after 6 weeks of treatment. Indomethacin significantly attenuated 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure for both losartan (2.2 mm Hg, P: <0.05) and captopril (2.7 mm Hg, P: <0.001) and also attenuated the effect of captopril in sitting trough diastolic blood pressure. Diastolic blood pressure changes during the day (7:00 am to 11:00 pm) were similar to the 24-hour response in both groups. Nocturnal diastolic blood pressure (11:01 pm to 6:59 am) was significantly attenuated in captopril-treated patients (2.0 mm Hg, P: < 0.05), but losartan was not affected (0.4 mmHg). Therefore, concurrent treatment with indomethacin similarly attenuates the 24-hour antihypertensive response to losartan and captopril.",0,0

The present study was designed to assess whether a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist or ACE inhibitor-based treatment could reduce carotid artery wall hypertrophy through reduction of carotid PP rather than reduction. mean BP, and whether the influence of local PP reduction could also be detected at the site of a muscular artery, the radial artery.; Ninety-eight essential hypertensive patients were randomized to 9 months of double-blind treatment with celiprolol or enalapril. Arterial parameters were determined with high-resolution echo-tracking systems. PP was measured locally with PP applanation tonometry and independently of mean BP. After 9 months of treatment, mean BP, carotid PP, and intima-media thickness (IMT) decreased significantly, with no differences between the two groups. Reduction in carotid pulse pressure, but not in mean BP, was an important independent determinant of carotid IMT reduction. The IMT and the PP of the radial artery decreased significantly with both treatments. However, the reduction in radial artery IMT was not related to changes in radial artery PP; Regression of carotid artery wall hypertrophy during long-term antihypertensive treatment depended on local PP reduction rather than mean BP reduction. The effect of PP reduction on IMT reduction was observed at the site of an elastic artery but not at the site of a muscular artery.",0,0

It was also possible to assess the agreement of the general practitioners' estimate of cardiovascular risk with the calculated percentage; The participation of 953 general practitioners in the study made it possible to estimate the absolute cardiovascular risk for 1,243 hypertensive patients. The patients were randomized into 2 groups according to whether or not physicians were aware of the calculated risk. The therapeutic strategy included monotherapy (Fosinopril 20 mg/day) with a follow-up of 8 weeks, with the possibility of increasing treatment at 4 weeks (Fosinopril + hydrochlorothiazide). To be included, patients had to be over 18 years of age and under 75 years of age, and had a blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg. The estimated and calculated cardiovascular risk at 10 years was classified according to the 1999 WHO-ISH guidelines: low risk <15%, medium risk 15-20%, high risk 20-30%, very high risk >30%; In this population aged 60 +/- 10 years, with 54% men, the agreement between the estimated risk and the calculated risk was 35%. This agreement was better for 'low risk' and 'very high risk', but is still less than 50%. The determinants of agreement were: sex (male), smoking and low HDL cholesterol. After 8 weeks of treatment, no differences were observed between the 2 groups in terms of final blood pressure level, percentage of normalized patients, and number of patients receiving dual therapy; General practitioner estimates of 10-year cardiovascular risk in hypertensive subjects are in poor agreement with the risk calculated using the Framingham equation.

In spontaneously hypertensive rats, myocardial fibrosis regressed and LV diastolic function improved by treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril. Whether this is true for patients with hypertensive heart disease was addressed in this prospective, randomized, double-blind trial.; A total of 35 patients with primary hypertension, LVH, and LV diastolic dysfunction were treated with lisinopril (n=18) or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; n=17). At baseline and after 6 months, LV catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy, Doppler echocardiography with measurements of peak LV flow velocities during early filling and atrial contraction and isovolumetric relaxation time, and monitoring of ventricular atrial fibrillation were performed. 24 hour blood pressure. Myocardial fibrosis was measured by LV collagen volume fraction and myocardial hydroxyproline concentration. With lisinopril, collagen volume fraction decreased from 6.9+/-0.6% to 6.3+/-0.6% (P:<0.05 vs. HCTZ) and myocardial hydroxyproline concentration from 9.9+/-0.3 to 8.3+/-0.4 microg/mg dry weight of LV (P:<0.00001 vs. HCTZ); this was associated with an increase in early-filling LV peak flow velocity index and atrial contraction from 0.72+/-0.04 to 0.91+/-0.06 (P:<0.05 vs. HCTZ) and a decrease in isovolumic relaxation time from 123+/-9 to 81+/-5 ms (P:<0.00002 vs. HCTZ). Normalized blood pressure did not change significantly in either group. There was no regression of LVH in patients treated with lisinopril, whereas with HCTZ, myocyte diameter was reduced from 22.1+/-0.6 to 20.7+/-0.7 microm (P: <0.01 vs. lisinopril); In patients with hypertensive heart disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with lisinopril can regress myocardial fibrosis, independent of LVH regression, and is associated with improved LV diastolic function.",0,0

There were 10 men and 5 women, aged between 4 and 56 years. Three patients had hypertension. Histological lesions were focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in 8; membranous glomerulonephritis in 3; mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis in 2 and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 2 patients. Proteinuria ranged between 3.64 and 8.66 g/1.73 m2/day. Serum albumin ranged between 2.2 and 3.3 g/dl. Serum creatinine was elevated >1.5 mg/dl in 3 cases. After stopping the steroids, enalapril was started at a dose of 2.5 mg/day and increased by 2.5 mg/day every 3-4 days up to the maximum tolerated dose but not exceeding 20 mg/day. Estimates of proteinuria, serum albumin, and serum creatinine were performed every 4 weeks for six months and every three months thereafter. The patients were followed for 6 to 30 months. Proteinuria decreased to <1.5 g/1.73 m2/day in 12 patients (80%) and to <0.5 g/1.73 m2/day in 10 patients (66.7%) at 8 weeks. There was no significant decrease in proteinuria in 3 (20%) patients; two of them were cases of FSGS and one of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hypercholesterolemia returned to normal in all patients who had decreased proteinuria. There was no correlation between the histological lesion and the response to enalapril. There was no increase in serum creatinine level above baseline in any of the patients. Except for cough in one patient, no other significant side effects were observed. We conclude that enalapril is effective in reducing proteinuria and thus morbidity in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, regardless of the underlying pathology.",0,0

The study was double-blind for placebo or active treatment, and open-label for dose levels. The same volunteer received placebo only once; Single oral doses of Z13752A, up to 800 mg, were well tolerated. Only six mild to moderate adverse events, mainly headache, were reported and appeared to be of little clinical relevance.

Following single oral doses of Z13752A, ACE inhibition appeared to be significant at all doses tested, correlated linearly with dose, and was nearly complete at doses > or = 100-200 mg. NEP inhibition was indicated by elevated plasma concentrations of ANP and cGMP in almost all subjects.

Additionally, two phase II clinical trials evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of telmisartan in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Telmisartan was administered as a single oral (1-160 mg) or intravenous (10-160 mg) dose to young men. In another multiple-dose study, 320 mg of telmisartan was administered orally once daily for 7 days to healthy young men. Elderly subjects received telmisartan orally (20 and 120 mg) once daily for 7 days. Patients with mild to moderate hypertension took telmisartan doses of 10, 20, 40, 80, 120, and 160 mg once daily for 7 days. In addition, oral telmisartan (40, 80, or 120 mg) was administered once daily for 28 days to hypertensive subjects. Following oral administration, the median time to peak plasma concentration of telmisartan was 0.5 to 2 hours, and peak plasma concentrations increased disproportionately with dose. In contrast, plasma concentrations were directly related to intravenous dose. A steady state was observed after 5 to 7 days of once daily dosing, and there was no clinically relevant accumulation at 28 days. Plasma concentration-time profiles were similar in all study groups and were characterized by rapid absorption and rapid biexponential decline after peak plasma concentration, with a prolonged terminal elimination phase (>20 h in healthy and hypertensive subjects). ). Telmisartan was well tolerated, with a low incidence of drug-related adverse events. The most common event was headache, which also occurred in placebo control subjects. No changes in heart rate, electrocardiograms, or clinical chemistry were detected after receiving telmisartan. Therefore, the study shows that high systemic levels of telmisartan can be achieved, and are well tolerated, in healthy adults of any age and in hypertensive subjects. The long terminal elimination half-life makes telmisartan suitable for once-daily dosing and contributes to sustained efficacy throughout the 24-hour dosing interval.",0,0

Tolerability was assessed by physical examination, laboratory parameters, 12-lead electrocardiogram, blood pressure and heart rate monitoring, and evaluation of adverse events.; Thirty-five centers in the United States.; Four hundred twenty-six patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension entered the study. Ninety-two percent (n=393) completed the study.; Patients underwent a four-week single-blind placebo run-in period before being randomized to oral telmisartan 80 mg once daily (n=214) or valsartan 80 mg (n=212) during an open-label period. eight weeks. label treatment period.; Telmisartan treatment was associated with a significantly greater mean reduction from baseline in mean ABPM diastolic blood pressure over the past 6 hours compared with the valsartan-treated group (-7.5+/-0.6 mmHg versus -5.2+/-0.6 mmHg, respectively). p<0.01). Secondary analyzes showed significantly greater efficacy with telmisartan 80 mg than with valsartan 80 mg, including greater mean reductions from baseline in ABPM (systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure) during the day (06:00 to 21:59 ) and in the morning (06:00 am). 00 to 11:59) hours, and greater decreases in minimum cuff blood pressure (P < 0.01). Both treatments showed similar tolerability profiles to placebo.; Telmisartan 80 mg once daily was superior to valsartan 80 mg once daily in lowering diastolic blood pressure during the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval. These results may be due to the longer plasma half-life of telmisartan or a higher potency compared to valsartan, such that a higher dose of valsartan may produce similar effects as 80 mg telmisartan. These data confirm the long duration of action of telmisartan with constant and sustained blood pressure control through 24 hours and during the last 6 hours of the dosing interval. Both treatments were well tolerated; Adverse event data confirmed the previously reported excellent tolerability profiles of telmisartan and valsartan.",0,0

Following a standardized screening protocol based on clearly defined drug-resistant hypertension or renal function impairment during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, patients underwent renal scintigraphy and a captopril-renin challenge test. A set of clinical features was also recorded. The sensitivity and specificity of the renal scintigraphy for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis was 0.72 and 0.90 and of the captopril-renin test from 0.77 to 0.91 and from 0.69 to 0. 75 according to the criteria used. The clinical characteristics were used to construct a clinical prediction rule for renal artery stenosis, which had a sensitivity of 0.68 and a specificity of 0.87 at a cutoff level of 30% predicted probability. However, with the prediction rule, a sensitivity of 0.90 could be achieved by performing arteriography only in patients with a predicted probability of stenosis > or = 10%, which would result in a considerable reduction in the number of arteriographies to be performed. A diagnostic strategy starting with drug-resistant hypertension and continuing with renal arteriography is recommended only in patients with a higher probability of stenosis. Patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis were randomized to balloon angioplasty (n = 56) versus antihypertensive medication (n = 50). Three months after randomization, 22 patients in the medication group underwent second stage balloon angioplasty. In an intention-to-treat analysis, no difference in blood pressure was found between groups after 3 months, nor after 12 months of follow-up, although there was a small medication-sparing effect of balloon angioplasty. The lack of a beneficial effect of balloon angioplasty compared to medication cannot be attributed to the high rate of recurrence of stenosis after angioplasty, nor to the fact that the inclusion criterion was set at a level of stenosis > or = 50% for patients with relatively mild strictures were also included. Renal function after angioplasty was slightly better in the angioplasty group than in the medication group, and renal scintigraphy improvement occurred more frequently after angioplasty. In addition to the treatment of patients with specific characteristics, the therapeutic approach presented is based on the extension of antihypertensive pharmacological treatment to blood pressure control. Only if blood pressure cannot be controlled or kidney function deteriorates is balloon angioplasty (with stent placement) indicated.",0,0

Antihypertensive drugs have different effects on glucose and insulin metabolism (GIM) and on LVM. To assess whether the effects of antihypertensive therapy on LVM are associated with its effects on IMT, we compared the effects of atenolol and perindopril on these parameters in a group of insulin-resistant obese hypertensives; A total of 21 hypertensive obese, non-diabetic patients, 55+/-12 years of age, with a body mass index of 32.8+/-5.0 kg/m2, without coronary or valvular heart disease and with normal heart function.

We investigated whether ACE inhibition improves endothelial function in such patients and compared the responses with those of healthy subjects; We studied 23 healthy volunteers (controls, age 29.8 [SD 7.0] years) and 24 type 1 diabetic patients (age 28.7 [9.6] years; HbA1c 8.1 [1.2]%; duration of diabetes 13.8 [2-30] years; blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg; 7 with microalbuminuria) after 5 weeks of ACE inhibition (quinapril, 10 mg day-1) and placebo in a randomized design , crossed, double blind. Estimates of endothelial function obtained were by flow-mediated vasodilation and plasma levels of endothelial-derived proteins; As estimated from placebo measurements, patients with type 1 diabetes, compared with controls, had some impairment of endothelial function: plasma tissue-type plasminogen activator levels were lower (3.5 vs. 5.4 ng mL(-1), P<0.05), but there were no significant differences in brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation or plasma levels of von Willebrand factor, endothelin-1, inhibitor plasminogen activator-1, soluble E-selectin, or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Compared with placebo, ACE inhibition increased flow-mediated vasodilation in controls (3.84% points [95% CI, 0.66 - 7.02], P<0.05), but not in patients with type 1 diabetes (0.82% points [95% CI, -2.72 - 4.36], P = 0.64; P = 0.08 vs. controls).

No studies have evaluated the comparative effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor versus an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) on changes in serum [K(+)] in people with kidney failure.; The study was a multicenter, randomized, double-crossover design, with each period lasting one month. A total of 35 people participated (21 men and 14 women, 19 African-Americans and 16 Caucasians), with a mean age of 56 +/- 2 years. The mean baseline serum [K(+)] was 4.4 +/- 0.1 mEq/L. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 65 +/- 5 ml/min/1.73 m(2), and blood pressure was 150 +/- 2/88 +/- 1 mm Hg. The main outcome measure was the difference from baseline in serum [K+] level, plasma aldosterone, and GFR after baseline and crossover periods; For the total group, serum [K(+)] changes were not significantly different between lisinopril or valsartan treatments. The subgroup with GFR values of < or = 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) receiving lisinopril demonstrated significant increases in serum [K(+)] of 0.28 mEq/L above baseline mean 4.6 mEq/L (P = 0.04). This increase in serum [K(+)] was also accompanied by a decrease in plasma aldosterone (P = 0.003). Relative to the overall group, the change in serum [K(+)] from baseline to posttreatment in the lisinopril group was greater among those with GFR values of < or = 60 mL/min/1.73 m (two). However, the lower GFR group taking valsartan demonstrated a smaller increase in serum [K(+)], 0.12 mEq/L above baseline (P = 0.1), a value 43 % lower compared to change in those receiving lisinopril. This moderate increase in [K(+)] in people taking valsartan was not associated with a significant decrease in plasma aldosterone (P = 0.14); In the presence of renal insufficiency, the ARB valsartan did not raise serum [K(+)] to the same degree as the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. This differential effect on serum [K(+)] is related to a relatively minor reduction in plasma aldosterone by ARB and is not related to changes in GFR. This study provides evidence that increases in serum [K(+)] are less likely with ARB therapy compared with ACE inhibitor therapy in people with renal insufficiency.",0,0

Therefore, effective antihypertensive treatment is required. Calcium antagonists are used to treat hypertension because, due to their mechanism of action, they can cause systemic and coronary vasodilation. In this study, the authors attempted to evaluate the activity and tolerability of diltiazem compared to ramipril in a group of elderly patients suffering from essential arterial hypertension.; A single-blind controlled study was conducted in which patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups, A and B, consisting of 25 patients each, treated respectively with 300 mg sustained-release diltiazem or 5 mg ramipril in a single daily dose. The study lasted 6 months and evaluated systolic and diastolic pressure and heart rate; Evolution was positive in all patients in Group A and in most patients in Group B, with normalization of both systolic and diastolic values. Heart rate showed a more persistent drop in Group A, but this was expected due to diltiazem's mechanism of action. No patient in Group A had to stop treatment, while one patient in Group B had to stop treatment after the appearance of persistent cough; Both treatments resulted in similar changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In light of these results, it can be stated that, at an oral dose of 300 mg/day, sustained-release diltiazem was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of mild to moderate essential arterial hypertension in the elderly.",0,0

Does the current prescription provide optimal treatment for patients with heart failure?,,"Hobbs, F D","Heart failure is an increasingly common and costly chronic disorder, with an increasing prevalence of at least 2% in populations older than 45 years, mortality rates that are as low as those of common solid cancers, and very high costs of treatment. utilization of medical care. Despite mounting evidence supporting a variety of effective, predominantly therapeutic interventions, significant degrees of physician underperformance remain in terms of diagnosing and managing heart failure. Until the early 1990s, treatment of heart failure was largely limited to symptomatic relief in patients with well-established heart failure on fluid overload. The introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors provided the first treatments that beneficially altered the prognosis of patients with the most common expression of heart failure, namely established systolic dysfunction, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. Evidence has now extended these benefits to slow the progression of heart failure and reduce hospitalization. Much of our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure derives from these studies. More recent data have clarified the limited role of digoxin, the important benefits of beta-blockers and aldosterone as adjuncts to ACE inhibition, and emerging evidence on angiotensin II antagonists. There is, in contrast to these positive findings, reliable data from Europe and North America revealing significant underperformance of hospital and primary care physicians in diagnosing and managing heart failure, with evidence of underuse and underdosing of heart failure-based therapies. on the evidence. Limited qualitative data suggest that the reasons for this poor performance are complex and relate to lack of access to objective tests of ventricular function and exaggerated concerns about the risks and side effects of treatment. Heart failure represents a complex group of aetiologies and risks that are not easy to identify correctly, even in specialized settings. Given that there is now powerful evidence on how heart failure can be modified and improved, explicit guidance is needed on which suspected patients should be referred, to confirm the diagnosis and advise on appropriate treatment regimens, and for which patients they can primarily be managed. within primary care. but with better access to objective non-invasive tests to improve diagnostic reliability and stratify patients to evidence-based therapies.

Animal models suggest that in the vasculature, angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2-R) expression may be increased in disease states associated with vascular remodeling. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of an AT1-R antagonist may be due in part to increased plasma angiotensin II levels, which stimulate AT2-R. However, it is unknown whether AT2-R is expressed in the skeletal muscle vasculature of patients with severe CHF; Steady-state transcript levels of the AT1-R and AT2-R genes were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in RNA samples prepared from skeletal muscle of 12 patients with severe CHF (f1.gif "" BORDER=""0""> O(2)<10 mL.kg(-1).min(-1)) and 5 age-matched healthy subjects who underwent vastus lateralis biopsies.

In this cohort, 719 (11%) of the patients had a history of diabetes. Among diabetic patients, 19% were treated with insulin, 52% with oral hypoglycemic agents, and 29% with diet alone. Diabetic patients were slightly older, more likely to be female, and had a higher prevalence of known cardiovascular disease. Despite the fact that diabetic patients had the same frequency of ST-segment elevation in the electrocardiogram and the same delay in admission, treatment with thrombolysis and aspirin was prescribed less frequently to diabetic patients than to patients without diabetes. The mortality rate was significantly increased in diabetic patients, with 7-year mortality being 79% in insulin-treated patients, 73% in tablet-treated patients, and 62% in diet-treated diabetic patients compared with 46% in patients without diabetes.

489,11078175,Effect of indomethacin on blood pressure in elderly patients with essential hypertension well controlled with amlodipine or enalapril.,,"Morgan, T O; Anderson, A; Bertram, D","Arthritis and hypertension are common comorbidities in the elderly hypertensive population. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to relieve pain in arthritic patients, but a side effect is sodium retention and subsequent elevation of blood pressure (BP). The effect of dihydropyridine calcium blockers is relatively independent of sodium intake, whereas the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be attenuated by a high-sodium diet. This study compared the effects of indomethacin with placebo in elderly patients with essential hypertension who had been controlled with amlodipine or enalapril. Indomethacin 50 mg twice daily or placebo was administered for 3 weeks in a double-blind crossover study to patients controlled on amlodipine or enalapril. Response was assessed by ambulatory BP measurement. Indomethacin raised BP and lowered pulse rate in patients taking enalapril but had little effect in patients taking amlodipine. The difference caused by indomethacin between the two groups was an increase in BP of 10.1/4.9 mm Hg and a drop in pulse rate of 5.6 beats/min in people taking enalapril. The addition of indomethacin to patients taking either drug caused weight gain and decreased plasma renin. The effect is postulated to be due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, leading to sodium retention. In patients taking amlodipine, the fall in plasma renin enhances the effect of sodium retention on BP. In patients taking enalapril, plasma renin falls but this does not translate into an effect due to blockade of the converting enzyme. Therefore, the total effect of sodium retention on BP is expressed. In patients treated with indomethacin, fewer patients may respond to ACE inhibitors. However, the main problem is the patient who is intermittently taking indomethacin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which, if a person is treated with an ACE inhibitor, causes blood pressure to go out of control. In such patients, amlodipine would appear to be a preferred option to enalapril.",0,0

This could be mediated by angiotensin II and the type 1 receptor or could be due to inhibition of kininase II and a sparing effect of bradykinin. Therefore, it is relevant to determine whether a type 1 receptor antagonist improves endothelial function; The influence of losartan (50 mg daily for four weeks) on endothelium-independent and -dependent vasodilator function was determined in 9 NIDDM subjects using a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover protocol. Forearm blood flow was measured by strain gauge plethysmography.; Losartan significantly decreased vascular resistance of the infused arm in response to three incremental doses of intrabrachial acetylcholine (p < 0.05, ANOVA). Forearm blood flow ratio (flow in the infused versus non-infused arm) also increased (p < 0.01). Responses to sodium nitroprusside and monomethylarginine did not change significantly; Losartan administration at 50 mg per day improved endothelium-dependent dilation of resistance vessels in NIDDM patients. That is, blockade of type 1 angiotensin II receptors improves endothelial function in NIDDM. At least part of the similar beneficial effect of ACE inhibition is probably also mediated via the angiotensin II type 1 receptor pathway.

In both groups, pts with inferior AMI (therefore 66% and 72%) and normal LV function (EF > or = 40% in ECHO) prevailed in the study. Captopril therapy was started at a dose of 3.125 mg, then every 8 hours a dose of 6.25 mg was administered on days I and II, 12.5 mg on day III and 25 mg from day IV. Exercise cycle ergometer tests (ExT) were performed on each pt at 14 days and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after AMI. The ExT started at 25 W of power and was increased at 2 min intervals by 25 W until fatigue or other typical cause of test termination.

However, the differences over this time between captopril and the control group were not significant in consecutive control steps. The final test result (positive, negative, doubtful) did not differ significantly in both groups in consecutive examination stages. Captopril administered for a period of 1 year after AMI slightly improved physical work capacity (accelerated improvement) and had no effect on ischemia during estimated cycle ergometer testing.

493,11081765,Renal implications of blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in heart failure.,,"Ruilope, L M; Barrios, V; Volpe, M","The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is actively involved in impaired kidney function from the early stages of heart failure (HF). The decrease in sodium excretion capacity secondary to the increase in proximal tubular reabsorption and the loss of renal functional reserve are the two most relevant initial alterations in renal function in which angiotensin II has been shown to act directly. Meanwhile, the octapeptide contributes to maintaining the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) within normal limits through vasoconstriction of the efferent arterioles. The administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) may therefore be accompanied by a functional decline in this parameter. Older age, higher initial serum creatinine, history of hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation predict the onset of impaired GFR associated with renin-angiotensin system blockade. Concomitant administration of beta-blockers may help protect kidney function, and preliminary data indicate that the combination of ACEi and ARBs is not associated with increased kidney risk. The good prognostic effects of aldosterone antagonists in HF do not seem to be related to the intrarenal effects of these compounds, with the exception of preventing potassium loss and hypokalaemia. The systematic therapeutic use of drugs with beneficial renal effects, to treat arterial hypertension or myocardial ischemia, can contribute to delaying or preventing the development of HF.",0,0

After a 2-week washout and a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, a total of 1390 patients were treated with 30 mg nifedipine (Study 1) or 5 mg amlodipine (Study 2) once daily for 4 weeks. The 1079 patients whose diastolic blood pressure remained between 95 and 115 mm Hg were randomized to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg, nifedipine 30 mg, or nifedipine 60 mg (Study 1). ), and amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or amlodipine 10 mg (Study 2). Both doses of combined calcium channel blocker/ACE inhibitor therapy reduced diastolic pressure as much as the high dose and significantly better than the lower dose of calcium channel blocker monotherapy (with either nifedipine or amlodipine). However, 15% of patients in the high-dose nifedipine monotherapy group and 24% in the high-dose amlodipine monotherapy group experienced some type of edema. In contrast, the incidence of edema was similar for patients treated with combination therapy and low-dose calcium antagonists.

Non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, including verapamil, reduce proteinuria to a similar extent as ACE inhibitors, including trandolapril, but to a greater extent than other antihypertensives. Angiotensin (Ang) II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil, show potent and long-term preventive effects against the progression of kidney injury. The objective of the present study is to evaluate whether verapamil, trandolapril and candesartan cilexetil affect proteinuria and urinary podocytes in patients with IgA nephropathy. Thirty-two normotensive patients between 18 and 54 years of age with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy, non-nephrotic proteinuria (1-3 g/day), and normal renal function (creatinine clearance >80 mL/min) were studied. Twenty patients with diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (non-IgA PGN) and 20 healthy controls were also included in this study.

Urinary podocytes were not detected in healthy controls. The 32 patients with IgA nephropathy were randomly divided into four treatment groups: those treated with verapamil (120 mg/day, n = 8); those treated with trandolapril (2 mg/day, n = 8); those treated with candesartan cilexetil (8 mg/day, n = 8) and those who received a placebo (n = 8). The treatment continued for 3 months. The antiproteinuric response in the trandolapril group was similar to that in the candesartan cilexetil group (-38 vs. -40%). The action of trandolapril or candesartan cilexetil was greater than that of verapamil (p < 0.01). The reduction in the number of urinary podocytes from baseline was significantly greater in patients treated with trandolapril or candesartan cilexetil than in patients treated with verapamil (p < 0.01). However, there was no difference between patients treated with trandolapril and those treated with candesartan cilexetil. Proteinuria and urinary podocytes were not affected in the placebo group.

We prospectively evaluated changes in blood pressure (BP), protein excretion, and renal function after administration of the long-acting ACE inhibitor ramipril as monotherapy for 6 months in 14 moderately hypertensive children aged 5 to 18 years with various nephropathies. Four patients initially had a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). BP was assessed by 24-h ambulatory monitoring. After 2 weeks of treatment with oral ramipril (1.5 mg/m2 once daily), mean systolic and diastolic 24-hour ambulatory BP values were reduced by more than 5 mmHg in nine patients. In eight patients the dose was doubled. At the end of the study, systolic BP was below the 95th percentile in 9 and diastolic BP in 13 patients.

Of 11 patients with increased albumin excretion (median 1.3 g/g creatinine), 6 responded to ramipril with a median reduction of 78% (range 24-83%), while albuminuria increased in 5 (median +19%). GFR was well preserved and no other adverse drug effects were observed. The study demonstrates that ramipril is an effective antihypertensive agent in children with renal hypertension.

Hypertension has been shown to carry an increased risk not only of cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality, but also of cognitive impairment and dementia. Although diastolic blood pressure is considered an important risk factor, it is now clear that isolated systolic hypertension and elevated pulse pressure also play an important role in the development of cerebral complications. Therefore, the treatment of these conditions must urgently become a widespread prevention tool. All randomized placebo-controlled trials conducted over the last 30 years have shown a reduction in fatal and/or non-fatal strokes. In the most recent trials in isolated systolic hypertension in older patients, the benefit was even greater due to the increased risk in these populations. New classes of drugs, in particular calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, have been shown to be as effective as the originally used diuretics and beta-blockers. Active treatment in the Syst-Eur trial based on nitrendipine as a first step, possibly associated with enalapril and/or hydrochlorothiazide, reduced not only stroke and cardiovascular complications, but also the incidence of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. This important finding needs to be confirmed by further trials focusing specifically on dementia prevention. Furthermore, the importance of pulse pressure as a risk factor underscores the need for new drugs that can increase aortic compliance and lower systolic blood pressure without greatly reducing diastolic pressure. Improving the management of hypertension offers new opportunities to reduce age-related diseases in the elderly and promote healthy aging.",0,0

Currently, 2 classes of drugs act by blocking the RAAS, although by different mechanisms: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs); The objective of this study was to evaluate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of the ARB irbesartan and the ACE inhibitor enalapril in patients > or = 65 years of age with mild to moderate hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP], 95 to 110 mmHg).; Elderly patients (> or = 65 years of age) from 26 Canadian study centers were recruited for an 8-week, double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Exclusion criteria included sitting DBP > 110 mm Hg or sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 200 mm Hg, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, cardiac procedure, stroke, or transient ischemic attack within 6 months of randomization , as well as other pre-existing or present antecedents. severe medical or psychological conditions. Patients were randomized to receive a single daily dose of irbesartan 150 mg (n = 70) or enalapril 10 mg (n = 71) with study drug treatment doses doubled at week 4 for sitting PAD > or = 90 mmHg. Reductions from baseline blood pressure measurements at trough (24 +/- 3 hours after the last dose of medication) for sitting DBP and SBP were assessed. Comparative tolerability to study drugs was also evaluated.; Intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated similar reductions at week 8 in both DBP and SBP for both groups. For the main efficacy analysis of sitting PAD, there was a mean reduction from baseline of 9.6 mm Hg and 9.8 mm Hg for the irbesartan and enalapril groups, respectively (P = 0.93). The mean reduction from baseline in sitting SBP was 10.1 mm Hg and 11.6 mm Hg for the irbesartan and enalapril groups, respectively (P = 0.54). Normalization rates (sitting DBP <90 mm Hg) at week 8 did not differ between groups (52.9% in the irbesartan group and 54.9% in the enalapril group; P = 0.81). There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups regarding serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events. Irbesartan was associated with a significantly lower incidence of cough than enalapril (4.3% vs. 15.5%, respectively; P = 0.046); Irbesartan is an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive agent in elderly patients with mild to moderate hypertension. This study establishes that irbesartan has better tolerability than enalapril with respect to cough and suggests that irbesartan is as effective in lowering blood pressure but better tolerated than an ACE inhibitor in hypertensive patients > or = 65 years of age.",0,0

Differential costs were based on resource use data collected in the trial and calculated using UK unit costs. Cost-effectiveness analysis related differential costs to differential life-years over a 4-year trial follow-up; The mean total number of hospital days per patient was 18.5 in the high-dose group and 22.5 in the low-dose group. Over the entire duration of the trial, the mean (SD) daily dose of lisinopril in the high-dose group was 22.5 mg (15.7 mg) compared to 3.2 mg (2.5 mg) in the high-dose group. low dose. The mean difference in cost per patient was £397 lower in the high dose group [95% CI (high dose-low dose) - £1263 to £436]. The mean years of life per patient were 0.085 years longer in the high dose group [95% CI (high dose-low dose) -0.0074 to 0.1706]. Based on mean costs and life years, high-dose therapy dominates low-dose (less expensive and more effective). Taking into account the uncertainty in mean costs and years of life, the probability that high-dose therapy was less expensive than low-dose was 82%. If a decision maker is willing to pay at least £3,600 per life year gained, the probability that the high dose would be more cost effective was 92%; The ATLAS Study demonstrated that treatment of heart failure with high-dose lisinopril has a high probability of being more cost-effective than low-dose therapy.",1,0

Therefore, we studied the relationship between the response of patients with IgA nephritis (IgAN) to ACEI/ATRA therapy by reducing proteinuria and its effect on the selectivity index (SI) in these patients; Forty-one patients with biopsy-proven IgAN entered a control trial, with 21 in the treatment group and 20 in the control group. Entry criteria included proteinuria of 1 g or more and/or renal failure. Patients in the treatment group received ACEI/ATRA or both with dose increases three times a month. In the control group, hypertension was treated with atenolol, hydralazine, or methyldopa. The following tests were performed at three-month intervals: serum creatinine, total urinary protein, SI, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and low molecular weight proteinuria (LMW); After a median duration of therapy of 13 +/- 5 months, there were no significant changes in serum creatinine, proteinuria, or SI in the treatment group, but in the control group, serum creatinine deteriorated from 1 .8 +/- 0.8 to 2.3. +/- 1.1 mg/dL (P < 0.05). Among the 21 patients in the treatment group, 10 responded to ACEi/ATRA therapy determined as a decrease in proteinuria by 30% (responders), and the other 11 did not respond (non-responders). Among responders, SI improved from a mean of 0.26 +/- 0.07 to 0.18 +/- 0.07 (P < 0.001), indicating a trend toward selective proteinuria. This was associated with an improvement in serum creatinine from a mean of 1.7 +/- 0.6 to 1.5 +/- 0.6 mg/dL (P < 0.02) and a decrease in proteinuria from a mean of 2.3 +/- 1.1 to 0.7 +/- 0.5 g/day (P < 0.001). After treatment, proteinuria in the treatment group (1.8 +/- 1.6 g/day) was significantly lower than that in the control group (2.9 +/- 1.8 g/day, P < 0.05). Post-treatment SI in the responder group (0.18 +/- 0.07) was better than that in the non-responder group (0.33 +/- 0.11, P < 0.002). Eight of 21 patients in the treatment group who had documented renal insufficiency had improved renal function compared with two in the control group (chi2 = 4.4, P < 0.05). Of the eight patients in the treatment group who improved their kidney function, three normalized their kidney function compared with one in the control group; Our data suggest that ACEI/ATRA therapy may be beneficial in IgAN patients with renal insufficiency and non-selective proteinuria, as such patients may respond to therapy with improved protein selectivity, decreased proteinuria, and improved proteinuria. renal function. ACEI/ATRA therapy likely modifies pore size distribution by reducing the radius of large nonselective pores, causing the bypass pathway to become less pronounced, resulting in less protein leakage to the urine.",0,0

The influence of losartan (50 mg daily for 4 weeks) on endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilator function was determined in 12 subjects with type II diabetes using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover protocol. Endothelial function of the duct vessels was assessed by high-resolution ultrasound and the response of the brachial artery to reactive hyperemia (flow-mediated dilation; FMD); Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) was used as a non-endothelial-dependent dilator.

There was no effect of losartan on endothelial-independent responses to GTN (17.8+/-1.8% to 17.6+/-1.2%). Consistent with our previous findings in resistance vessels, administration of 50 mg losartan daily improves NO-mediated dilation in blood vessels in subjects with type II diabetes. Together with the findings that both ACE inhibition and angiotensin II blockade improve resistance vessel function in this group, it is likely that at least part of the beneficial effect is mediated via the angiotensin II receptor pathway. /type I.

ACE inhibition increased lung NO production in normotensive subjects but not in hypertensive patients. The reduced production of angiotensin II and/or the accumulation of bradykinin in the lung tissue may be responsible for the increased production of NO in components of the lung, such as pulmonary vascular endothelium, bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages, cells nasopharyngeal and neurons. However, the effects of ACE inhibition on lung NO production differ between hypertensive and normotensive subjects.",0,0

We examined 334 type 1 diabetic patients with suspected microalbuminuria and normal blood pressure; Of these, 140 patients aged 18 to 65 years with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and persistent microalbuminuria, defined as a urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) of 20 to 200 microg/min, were enrolled in the study.; The proportion of patients who progressed to macroalbuminuria was reduced in the ramipril groups but did not reach statistical significance over 2 years. AER was significantly lower at year 2 in patients treated with combined ramipril versus placebo (P = 0.013). More ramipril patients regressed to normoalbuminuria (<20 microg/min), with 11% for ramipril 1.25 mg, 20% for ramipril 5 mg, and 4% for placebo (P = 0.053). Blood pressure was significantly lowered to a similar degree with ramipril 1.25 and 5 mg. Supine systolic blood pressure increased from 130 to 134 mmHg in the placebo group and decreased in the ramipril 1.25 mg group (132 to 129 mmHg) and in the ramipril 5 mg group (134 to 130 mmHg) (p = 0.003, compared to placebo). No statistically significant changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were observed between the placebo and ramipril groups over the 2-year period; Microalbuminuria is significantly reduced by ramipril treatment in type 1 diabetic patients without hypertension. Although the magnitude of the response was greater, there is no significant difference between the responses to 1.25 or 5 mg of ramipril. Small but highly significant reductions in systolic and mean arterial pressures occur in patients treated with ramipril. The GFR is stable at this stage of the evolution of diabetic nephropathy and is not affected by treatment with ramipril for 2 years.",0,0

524,11129125,Lercanidipine: a review of its use in hypertension.,,"McClellan, K J; Jarvis, B","Lercanidipine is a vasoselective dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that causes systemic vasodilation by blocking the influx of calcium ions through L-type calcium channels in cell membranes. It is a highly lipophilic drug and as such has a slower onset of action and longer duration of action than other calcium antagonists. Preclinical evidence suggests that lercanidipine has antiatherogenic potential and may also protect against target organ damage. In well-controlled clinical studies, once-daily administration of lercanidipine 10 or 20 mg effectively lowered blood pressure (BP) compared with placebo in patients with mild to moderate hypertension without affecting heart rate. Response rate (percentage of patients with diastolic BP < or = 90 mm Hg or reduced by > or = 10 mm Hg from baseline) ranged from 50% to 66% with lercanidipine 10 mg/day and up to 86% with lercanidipine 20 mg. /day. The drug was long-acting: clinical measurements of diastolic BP showed a trough/peak ratio of >0.8 for both doses of lercanidipine in 1 study. Comparative trials, either published in full or as abstracts, found that lercanidipine 10 mg once daily for > or = 4 weeks was at least as effective as atenolol 50 mg once daily, candesartan cilexetil 16 mg/day , captopril 25 mg twice daily, enalapril 20 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once daily, irbesartan 150 mg daily, and slow-release nifedipine 20 mg twice daily in patients with mild to moderate hypertension . Furthermore, lercanidipine 20 mg/day was as effective as amlodipine 10 mg/day. Lercanidipine is effective in the treatment of elderly patients (60 to 85 years of age) with mild to moderate essential hypertension and those with isolated systolic hypertension. Furthermore, monotherapy with lercanidipine 20 or 40 mg/day has shown efficacy in patients with severe hypertension, and additional therapy helped control BP in a large proportion of patients with severe hypertension who did not respond sufficiently to beta-blockers, diuretics, or inhibitors. of the ACE. . Unpublished data indicate that the drug lowers blood pressure in patients with type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus, without adversely affecting glucose homeostasis. Lercanidipine was well tolerated in clinical trials, with most treatment-related adverse events typical of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, namely headache, hot flushes, dizziness, and ankle edema; Lercanidipine is an effective and well-tolerated once-daily antihypertensive agent in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In addition, the drug can lower BP when used as monotherapy in patients with severe hypertension or as an adjunct in patients with resistant hypertension. Importantly, lercanidipine appears to be at least as effective and well tolerated as other commonly used antihypertensive agents. Therefore, the drug represents a useful therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with hypertension and will be particularly useful in patients who do not respond to or are intolerant to antihypertensive agents from other drug classes.",0,0

The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the effects of calcium channel blockers and other antihypertensive drugs on major cardiovascular events.; We conducted a meta-analysis of trials in hypertension that evaluated cardiovascular events and included at least 100 patients, who were randomly assigned intermediate-acting or long-acting calcium antagonists or other antihypertensive drugs and who were followed for at least 2 years.; The nine eligible trials included 27,743 participants. Calcium antagonists and other drugs achieved similar control of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Compared with patients assigned diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or clonidine (n = 15,044), those receiving calcium channel blockers (n = 12,699) had a significantly increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio 1.26 [95% CI 1.11-1.43], p=0.0003), congestive heart failure (1.25 [1.07-1.46], p=0.005 ) and major cardiovascular events (1.10 [1.02-1.18], p=0.018). Treatment differences were within the game of chance for the outcomes of stroke (0.90 [0.80-1.02], p=0.10) and all-cause mortality (1.03 [0.94 -1.13], p=0.54); In randomized controlled trials, the large available database suggests that calcium channel blockers are inferior to other classes of antihypertensive medications as first-line agents in reducing the risks of several important complications of hypertension.

We did separate summaries of trials comparing active treatment regimens with placebo, trials comparing more intensive and less intensive strategies for lowering blood pressure, and trials comparing treatment regimens based on different drug classes; The hypotheses to be investigated, the trials to be included and the outcomes to be studied were selected before the results of any participating trial were known. Each trial provided individual participant data or group tabular data and combined them using standard statistical techniques; The summary of placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors (four trials, 12,124 patients mostly with coronary heart disease) revealed reductions in stroke (30% [95% CI 15-43]), coronary heart disease ( 20% [11-28] ), and major cardiovascular events (21% [14-27]). Summary of placebo-controlled trials of calcium channel blockers (two trials, 5,520 patients mostly with hypertension) showed reductions in stroke (39% [15-56]) and major cardiovascular events (28% [13- 41]).

In abstracts comparing different antihypertensive regimens (eight trials, 37,872 patients with hypertension), several differences in cause-specific effects between calcium channel blocker-based therapy and other regimens were noted, but each was of marginal importance; Abstracts of placebo controlled trials provide strong evidence for the benefits of ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers.

Two polysomnograms of 54 male hospitalized hypertensive obstructive sleep apnea patients were analyzed in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril (C), 2.5 mg once daily, or placebo (P). Blood pressure was measured using an intra-arterial catheter. Compared with P, C reduced mean arterial BP during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) (-8.3 +/- 10.7 mm Hg, P = 0.05) and REM sleep (-8.6 + /- 10.1 mm Hg, P = 0.02). Respiratory disturbance index (-8.6 +/- 3.2 events/h of sleep (n/h), p = 0.01) and apnea index (AI) (-6.6 +/- 3.0 n/h, p = 0.04) during NREM sleep were reduced by C and, to a lesser extent, by P (-5.9 +/- 3.2 n/h, P = 0.07 and -5, 0 +/- 3.6 n/h, P = 0.18, respectively). The effect on IA and hypopnea index (HI) during REM sleep was not significant for C (-5.9 +/- 3.4 and 0.1 +/- 2.0, NS, respectively) and P (-2.6 +/- 3.9 and 1.6 +/- 2.0, NS, respectively). There was a significant linear correlation between change in REM systolic BP and change in REM IA (r = 0.28, P = 0.04); the mean change in BP was negatively correlated with the change in HI (-0.28, p = 0.04). During NREM sleep there was no significant correlation between changes in BP and the effects of treatment on sleep apnea activity. Blood pressure reduction after short-term antihypertensive treatment did not affect sleep-disordered breathing during NREM sleep. Reduced blood pressure was associated with a weak reduction in IA and a slight increase in HI during REM sleep. It appears that elevated BP contributes only marginally to the severity of sleep apnea in hypertensive patients with obstructive sleep apnea.",0,0

On the other hand, these effects of ACE inhibitors have not been well established in patients with essential hypertension. This study was conducted to prospectively assess whether an ACE inhibitor, temocapril, could modify the rate of urinary microalbumin excretion (UAE) in hypertensive outpatients who did not have signs of renal failure. To compare the long-term effect of temocapril with that of a diuretic in the UAE, hypertensive patients treated with a diuretic (trichlormethiazide) were enrolled in a prospective study if they had normal serum creatinine levels and no overt proteinuria during a screening period. of 3 months . A ratio of urinary microalbumin to urinary creatinine (mg albumin/mmol Cr) was used as an estimate of UAE. Patients visited the hospital monthly to determine blood pressure (BP) and UAE. After initial observation during diuretic treatment, subjects were randomly divided into two groups. In group A, the diuretic was changed to temocapril, 2 to 4 mg once a day for 12 months. In group B, subjects continued to receive the diuretic for an additional 12 months. Seventy-six outpatients (41 men and 35 women; mean age, 59.0+/-1.4 years) with essential hypertension entered the study. The effects of temocapril on BP appeared to be clinically similar to those of trichloromethiazide, but the use of temocapril significantly decreased EAU. In group A (n=37), EAU decreased significantly (p<0.01) from baseline of 4.19+/-0.37 mg albumin/mmol Cr to 2.47+/-0, 29 and 2.68+/-0.28 mg albumin/mmol Cr at the 6th and 12th month of temocapril therapy, respectively. In contrast, in group B (n=39), UAE did not change (baseline, 4.16+/-0.63 mg albumin/mmol Cr; 6 months, 4.92+/-0.72; 12 months, 4.71+/-0.74). These results indicate that long-term temocapril therapy may be superior in reducing UAE to diuretic therapy in patients with essential hypertension who did not have signs of renal failure.",0,0

Recent guidelines for the treatment of hypertension, such as the JNC VI and WHO/ISH guidelines, recommend that antihypertensive agents be set at levels as low as 130/85 mmHg and that blood pressure be lowered to less than 130/85 mmHg . Our study was designed to clarify how well and to what extent blood pressure (BP) was controlled in Japanese hypertensive patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. We interviewed two hundred physicians, randomly selected from members of the Japan Society of Hypertension. (JSH) (n=98) and the Japan Diabetes Society (JDS) (n=102) and obtained information on their 5 most recent cases of hypertension with (n=954 total) and their 2 most recent cases of hypertension without diabetes (n=371 total). The achieved BP was below 140/90 mmHg in 40.5% of non-diabetics and 38.3% of hypertensive diabetics. The percentage of patients with BP less than 130/85 mmHg was 10.8% in non-diabetics and 11.4% in diabetics. The mean number of hypotensive drugs used was 1.46 in non-diabetics and 1.52 in diabetics. Physicians prescribed more ACE inhibitors and alpha blockers to diabetics than to non-diabetics, although Ca antagonists were given to more than 70% of patients, regardless of whether or not they had diabetes. In contrast, fewer beta-blockers and diuretics were given to diabetics. These results suggest that although Japanese physicians are considering the effects of hypotensive agents on metabolism and renal function when treating hypertensive diabetics, the blood pressure achieved in both hypertensives with diabetes and those without diabetes is insufficient. with only one in ten patients with high blood pressure. less than 130/85 mmHg even among diabetics. Therefore, it will be necessary to improve blood pressure control to treat high-risk groups, such as patients with diabetes mellitus.",0,0

The first group (group 1: n=8) received lisinopril 10-20 mg daily for 8 weeks, followed by nitrendipine 5-10 mg daily for another 8 weeks. The second group (group 2: n=9) received nitrendipine 5-10 mg daily for 8 weeks followed by lisinopril 10-20 mg daily for another 8 weeks.

EAU significantly decreased after 8 weeks of lisinopril treatment in group 1 and after 8 weeks of subsequent lisinopril treatment in group 2. On the other hand, EAU was not altered by nitrendipine treatment. Changes in UAE correlated significantly with changes in MAP after 8 weeks of nitrendipine treatment, but not after 8 weeks of lisinopril treatment. No significant changes in creatinine clearance, urinary sodium excretion, or urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide were observed with any treatment in either group. These results suggest that lisinopril, and not nitrendipine, reduces UAE in essential hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria regardless of its effective antihypertensive properties.",0,0

There is convincing data that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and adrenergic blockade are the most important therapies and have the potential to improve survival and decrease morbidity. Higher doses of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers seem to provide additional benefits. The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone, when used in severe heart failure, provides an additional survival advantage when added to standard triple therapy. Angiotensin receptor blockers have not been shown to be superior to ACE inhibitors, and their role in the treatment of heart failure requires further investigation. Data from no trials support the use of inotropic agents or calcium channel blockers in heart failure. Several new therapeutic agents, including vasopressin antagonists and tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor antibody, are in phase II and III clinical trials. If they prove beneficial, they may provide new treatment options for heart failure patients. However, the current challenge is to increase the use of proven therapies, namely ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, to improve outcomes in the rapidly growing population of patients with congestive heart failure.",0,0

After 3 years of continuous treatment, he developed jaundice and progressive liver failure that continued despite discontinuation of medication. The patient was not taking any other medication. All known causes of acute liver failure could be excluded by indicating drug-induced liver injury after long-term treatment with enalapril. Analysis of liver biopsies revealed a pathomorphologic pattern comparable to that seen in severe halothane hepatitis. Serologic studies, including enalapril stimulation of T cells and a broad spectrum of autoimmunity evidence, including autoantibodies against calreticulin, the major Ca2+ and Zn2+ binding protein of the endoplasmic reticulum and suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of halothane hepatitis, were negative. Therefore, the mechanism of liver damage induced by enalapril remains obscure. Liver failure progressed and ultimately led to orthotopic liver transplantation. To our knowledge, this is the longest duration of chronic treatment with an ACE inhibitor before liver failure occurred. In addition, liver failure progressed despite withdrawal of medication. It is concluded that even after long-term treatment with an ACE inhibitor, liver failure can be induced. Therefore, regular monitoring of liver enzymes should be considered.",0,0

Hypersensitivity or immune-mediated reactions, although less common, tend to be proportionally more severe. There is convincing evidence implicating the immune system in the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity reactions. Our understanding of how the immune system recognizes drugs is based on the hapten hypothesis; the onset of hypersensitivity involves drug bioactivation, covalent binding to proteins, followed by uptake, antigen processing, and T-cell proliferation. Central to this hypothesis is the critical role of drug metabolism, being the balance between metabolic bioactivation and detoxification is an important component of individual susceptibility. The purpose of this review is to classify drug hypersensitivity reactions in terms of their clinical presentation and also to consider recent advances in our understanding of the chemical, biochemical and, in particular, cellular immunological mechanisms of hypersensitivity. The following topics are reviewed: (i) drug disposition and cellular metabolism; (ii) antigen processing and presentation mechanisms; (iii) the role of cytokines and costimulatory molecules in the induction and maintenance of a polarized immune response; and (iv) the application of the hapten hypothesis, the hazard hypothesis, and the serial activation model to drug hypersensitivity.

A total of 119 patients with acute myocardial infarction and a wall motion index < or = 1.2 (16-segment echocardiographic model) were randomized to receive double-blind treatment with trandolapril or placebo within 3-7 days. at the onset of infarction. Blinded treatment was discontinued 21 days after the index infarction. Venous blood samples were collected at rest, before randomization, and the day after stopping treatment. At the end of the study, there was no difference in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide between the two treatment groups. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity was suppressed and plasma renin activity was higher in the trandolapril group. No differences were found in plasma levels of N-terminal proatrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, large endothelin-1, and neuropeptide Y between the two treatment groups. There were positive correlations between several markers of neurohormonal activation at the beginning of the study and variables that express left ventricular dysfunction and clinical heart failure. Neurohormonal activation is related to left ventricular dysfunction. The effects of 2-3 weeks of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on neurohormonal activation do not predict the long-term beneficial effects already established after myocardial infarction. Therefore, early modulation of circulating levels of neurohormones may not be an important mechanism for the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in these patients. Selected plasma hormone markers can still be used to identify patients who might benefit most from treatment.",0,0

544,11171786,Comparative effect of ACE inhibition and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonism on nitric oxide bioavailability in patients with coronary artery disease: role of superoxide dismutase.,,"Hornig, B; Landmesser, U; Kohler, C; Ahlersmann, D; Spiekermann, S; Christoph, A; Tatge, H; Drexler, H","Flow-dependent endothelium-mediated vasodilation (FDD) and extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) activity, the major antioxidant enzyme of the arterial wall, are severely impaired in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We hypothesize that both ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor type 1 antagonist (AT(1)-A) increase the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) by reducing oxidative stress in the vessel wall, possibly by increasing the activity of EC-SOD.; Thirty-five patients with DKA were randomized to 4 weeks of ACEI (ramipril 10 mg/d) or AT(1)-A (losartan 100 mg/d). Radial artery FDD was determined by high-resolution ultrasound before and after intra-arterial N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) to inhibit NO synthase and before and after intra-arterial vitamin C to determine the portion of FDD inhibited by free oxygen radicals. EC-SOD activity was determined after release from the endothelium by bolus injection of heparin. FDD was improved after ramipril and losartan (each group P<0.01) and, in particular, the portion of FDD mediated by NO, that is, inhibited by L-NMMA, increased >75% (each group P<0, 01). Vitamin C initially improved FDD, an effect that was lost after ramipril or losartan. After therapy, EC-SOD activity increased >200% in both groups (ACEI, 14.4+/-1.1 vs. 3.8+/-0.9 and AT(1)-A, 13 0.5+/-1.0 vs. 3.9+/-0.9 U, mL(-1), min(-1), each P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS-Four weeks of ramipril or losartan therapy improve endothelial function to similar degrees in CAD patients by increasing NO bioavailability. Our results suggest that the long-term beneficial effects of interference with the renin-angiotensin system may be related to the reduction of oxidative stress within the arterial wall, mediated in part by increased EC-SOD activity.",0,0

Taking into account the close correlation between morphological changes and prognosis, our objective was to investigate whether the benefit of both beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors could lie in a similar protective effect on infarct size or ventricular volume; In a double-blind, randomized comparison between early treatment with captopril or atenolol in 121 patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction, both drugs showed a similar reduction in mean arterial pressure. However, only patients treated with atenolol showed a significant early reduction in heart rate. Infarct size, obtained from perfusion defect on resting single photon emission imaging, was greater in captopril-treated patients than in atenolol-treated patients: 29.8+/-12% vs. 20.8+ /-12% (P:<0.01) by polar map and 28.3+/-13% versus 20.0+/-13% (P:<0.01) by tomography. Changes from baseline to 1 week and 3 months in ventricular end-diastolic volume, as assessed by echocardiography, were as follows: 58+/-14 versus 64+/-19 (P<0.05) and 65+/-21 mL /m(2) (P<0.05), respectively, with captopril and 58+/-18 vs 64+/-18 (P<0.05) and 69+/-30 ml/m(2) ( P<0.05), respectively, with atenolol. Neither group showed significant changes in end-systolic volume. Among patients with perfusion defects >18% (n=51), those treated with atenolol showed a significant increase in end-systolic and end-diastolic ventricular volumes, whereas patients treated with captopril did not. ; Although early treatment with atenolol or captopril results in similar short- and medium-term overall preservation of ventricular function and volumes, in patients with larger infarcts, a beta-blocker alone does not adequately protect the myocardium from ventricular dilatation.",1,0

However, the relationship between LV wall tension and LV remodeling is not fully defined; We prospectively studied the relationship between regional wall stress and LV remodeling by applying the finite element method to end-systolic LV models from patients enrolled in the Healing and Early Afterload Reducing Therapy (HEART) trial. Individual LV models were constructed from orthogonal apical echocardiographic views obtained on day 14 after anteroseptal MI in 64 patients. Of these, 31 patients received low-dose ramipril (0.625 mg) and 33 patients received full-dose ramipril (10 mg). LV wall tension was calculated by the finite element method and correlated with the change in LV volume from day 14 to day 90 after MI; Among all patients, increases in apical regional wall tension were associated with changes in LV volume (P trend = 0.015). The relationship between apical regional wall tension and LV volume change was strongest in the low-dose ramipril group (r = 0.53, P = 0.002) and remained significant after adjustment for end-diastolic volume , infarct size, ejection fraction, and systolic pressure. blood pressure was still attenuated in the full-dose ramipril group; Apical regional wall stress is an independent predictor of posterior LV remodeling after MI.

Improved therapy for heart failure has resulted in significantly prolonged survival, fewer hospitalizations, and improved quality of life for many patients. It can be reasonably expected, therefore, that adherence to a rational medical regimen for these patients could also reduce costs. Management of patients with severe heart failure begins with identification of the etiology and education of patients and their families. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the cornerstone of therapy, but only after diagnostic testing to establish the etiology and extent of myocardial dysfunction. Because heart transplantation is a therapeutic option for only a limited number of patients, other surgical and medical therapies should be considered as the mainstay of a treatment strategy.",0,0
548,11174914,Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes: lessons from recent trials.,,"Agarwal, R","Hypertension plays a fundamental role in causing a high rate of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus. Large trials show that lowering blood pressure in the diabetic patient who has hypertension has profoundly beneficial effects. This review looks at recent trials to answer the question of how low patients' blood pressure should be and what agents should be used to achieve this. Guidelines from the National Institutes of Health, published in the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, call for a blood pressure goal of <130/85 mmHg in patients with diabetes. Based on data from recent trials, an even lower blood pressure of <130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes and hypertension appears to be appropriate. Observational studies show that the lowest rate of cardiovascular events is seen in patients with diabetes whose systolic blood pressure is <120 mmHg. Therefore, target blood pressure in patients with diabetes who have hypertension may need to be revised lower, to <120/80 mmHg. In patients with overt proteinuria of 1 g/d or more, a mean arterial pressure of <92 mmHg is recommended. The available evidence justifies the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as first-line agents and angiotensin receptor blockers in those patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors. Because the target blood pressure is lower in patients with diabetes who are hypertensive, these patients require the use of multiple agents. Diuretics or long-acting calcium channel blockers are a logical second choice because of their observed synergistic blood pressure-lowering effect with ACE inhibitors. However, alpha blockers should be used with caution. In patients with kidney disease, loop diuretics may be required to reduce sodium and volume overload and to improve blood pressure control.",0,0

The current study examines the safety and tolerability of high-dose lisinopril compared to low-dose in CHF; The Assessment of Lisinopril and Survival study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial in which patients with or without prior ACE inhibitor therapy stabilized on a medium dose of lisinopril (12.5 or 15.0 mg once daily). once a day [OD]) for 2 to 4 weeks. and then randomized to high-dose (35.0 or 32.5 mg OD) or low-dose (5.0 or 2.5 mg OD) groups. Patients with New York Heart Association class II to IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions not greater than 0.30 (n = 3164) were randomized and followed for a median of 46 months. We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for dose interruption and reduction during treatment, focusing on hypotension and renal dysfunction; Of 405 patients who did not previously receive an ACE inhibitor, doses in only 4.2% could not be adjusted to the median doses required for randomization due to symptoms possibly related to hypotension (2.0%) or due to dysfunction renal or hyperkalaemia (2.3%). Doses in more than 90% of randomized patients in the high- and low-dose groups were adjusted to their assigned target, and mean blinded medication doses in both groups remained similar throughout the study. Withdrawals occurred in 27.1% of the high-dose groups and 30.7% of the low-dose groups. Subgroups presumed to be at increased risk of ACE inhibitor intolerance (blood pressure, <120 mm Hg; creatinine, > or = 132.6 micromol/L [> or = 1.5 mg/dL]; age, > or = 70 years and patients with diabetes) generally tolerated the high-dose strategy; These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitor therapy in most patients with congestive heart failure can be successfully titrated and maintained at high doses, and that more intensive use of these agents is warranted.",0,0

Subjects received loading doses of oral warfarin once daily on days 1 through 5, which were individually titrated on days 6 and/or 9 to achieve stable pre-dose prothrombin time (INRpre) values between 1.2 and 1.8 at the end of phase 1 medication (day 14). From days 15 to 24 (medication phase 2), subjects received telmisartan 120 mg orally once daily in addition to individualized oral doses of warfarin once daily. On days 25 to 31 (medication phase 3), oral warfarin was resumed once daily alone in individualized doses. Under steady-state conditions, INRpre was unchanged during medication phases 1, 2, and 3. The difference between phases 1 and 3 was -0.04 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0. 7 to 0.10) and between phases 2 and 1 it was 0.03 (95% CI: -0.11 to 0.10). Mean trough plasma warfarin concentrations (Cpre) were stable during warfarin alone, but showed a small but statistically significant decrease during the combination medication phase. The point estimate of the phase 2/phase 1 ratio was 0.89 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.95). The decrease in Cpre did not result in a decrease in anticoagulation. This suggests that the extent of the pharmacokinetic interaction between telmisartan and warfarin is limited, and since telmisartan had no effect on INRpre and concomitant medication was well tolerated, there is no evidence of a clinically relevant interaction between telmisartan and warfarin.",0,0
560,11185632,Pharmacokinetics of paracetamol and ibuprofen when co-administered with telmisartan in healthy volunteers.,,"Stangier, J; Su, C A; Fraunhofer, A; Tetzloff, W","Two open-label, crossover, bidirectional studies were conducted to assess any pharmacokinetic interactions of telmisartan with paracetamol or ibuprofen. Healthy male adult volunteers (n = 12) received a single oral dose of acetaminophen 1 g alone and with oral telmisartan 120 mg in one study. Oral ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily with and without oral telmisartan once daily 120 mg was given for 7 days in the other study in 6 men and 6 women. In both studies, there was a washout period of > or = 13 days between administration of single and combined drugs. The primary endpoints Cmax and AUC were compared between the combination (acetaminophen or ibuprofen + telmisartan) and the single agent medication (acetaminophen or ibuprofen). Pharmacokinetic drug interaction was evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and calculation of 90% confidence intervals (CI) for treatment relationships using log-transformed parameters. Bioequivalence (ie, lack of interaction) was concluded if the 90% CI of the ratios for both Cmax and AUC were within the acceptance limit of 0.80 to 1.25. Geometric mean Cmax values for acetaminophen and R-(-)- and S-(+)-ibuprofen enantiomers were similar with and without telmisartan co-administration (12.6 micrograms/mL vs. 14.1 micrograms/mL; 17, 3 micrograms/mL vs. 16.7 micrograms/mL). mL; 19.4 micrograms/mL vs. 19.5 micrograms/mL, respectively), and the values for R-(-)- as well as S-(+)-ibuprofen were bioequivalent. Geometric mean AUC values for paracetamol and R-(-)- and S-(+)-ibuprofen were also bioequivalent with and without telmisartan. The distribution and elimination parameters of paracetamol and ibuprofen were comparable in the presence or absence of telmisartan. Concomitant and single-agent medications were well tolerated. In conclusion, the long half-life and excellent safety profile of telmisartan were not affected by concomitant medication with acetaminophen or ibuprofen; therefore, once-daily telmisartan dosing can be maintained, which may help optimize patient compliance, and patients can self-administer concomitant acetaminophen or ibuprofen.",0,0
561,11185633,Pharmacokinetics of repeated oral doses of amlodipine and amlodipine plus telmisartan in healthy volunteers.,,"Stangier, J; Su, C A","This open-label, crossover study was conducted to establish whether there is evidence of an interaction between telmisartan, an angiotensin II antagonist, and amlodipine, a class II (dihydropyridine) calcium channel antagonist, based on pharmacokinetics and safety. In a two-way crossover trial, 12 healthy Caucasian males were randomized to receive once daily for 9 days oral amlodipine 10 mg with or without oral telmisartan 120 mg. After a washout period of > or = 13 days, subjects were switched to the other medication regimen. The geometric means of the primary pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state (day 9) for amlodipine when administered alone were as follows: maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) 17.7 ng/mL, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC ) 331 ng.h /ml and renal clearance of 39.5 ml/min, excreting 8% of the total dose of amlodipine. When telmisartan was administered concomitantly, the respective values were 18.7 ng/ml, 352 ng.h/ml and 43.0 ml/min, with 9.4% of the total dose of amlodipine excreted via the kidneys. The 90% confidence interval (CI) limits for the ratios of these steady-state parameters were 0.97 to 1.14 for Cmax and 0.98 to 1.16 for AUC; both were within the predefined reference range (0.8 to 1.25) for bioequivalence. Due to the high interindividual variability in urinary excretion of amlodipine, bioequivalence for renal clearance was not demonstrated. Adverse effects were few, mild to moderate in intensity, and transient, whether amlodipine was given alone or with telmisartan. Vital signs, except blood pressure, and clinical laboratory values were not affected by any of the medications. The findings of this study show that telmisartan and amlodipine can be administered concomitantly as there is no clinically significant change in the primary pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine in the presence of telmisartan, and the safety of the combination is comparable to that of amlodipine alone.",0,0
562,11185634,Pharmacokinetics and safety of intravenous and oral telmisartan 20 mg and 120 mg in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy volunteers.,,"Stangier, J; Su, C A; SchÃ¶ndorfer, G; Roth, W","The pharmacokinetics and safety of telmisartan were evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment in a single-center, open-label study. Single oral doses of 20 mg and 120 mg of telmisartan, separated by a 14-day washout period, were administered to 12 subjects with hepatic impairment and 12 healthy subjects. In 5 subjects with hepatic impairment who received both oral doses, a single 120 mg iv infusion of telmisartan was subsequently administered. Following oral administration, the pharmacokinetic profile of telmisartan was characterized by rapid absorption and disposition kinetics and a slow terminal elimination phase with mean half-lives of 27 to 42 hours. The maximum plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of telmisartan (AUC0-infinity) were increased in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy volunteers by 6.4-fold and 2.7-fold, respectively, for 20 mg telmisartan. and 3.2 times and 3.1 times. , respectively, for telmisartan 120 mg. Peak plasma concentrations and AUC0-infinity after iv infusion were markedly elevated compared to values obtained in other studies in healthy volunteers. Hepatic impairment resulted in an apparent increase in the absolute bioavailability of telmisartan, and the total clearance after oral and intravenous administration was significantly reduced compared to healthy volunteers. Plasma protein binding of telmisartan was > or = 99.5% in healthy and hepatic impaired subjects and did not change compared to healthy subjects. Oral and intravenous telmisartan was well tolerated in both healthy and liver patients; Headache was the most common potentially telmisartan-related adverse event. Changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters were transient and without clinical relevance. The good tolerability of telmisartan in patients with hepatic insufficiency demonstrated in this study, the sustained control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients and the higher exposure in patients with hepatic insufficiency suggest that effective treatment of hypertensive patients with hepatic insufficiency would be achieved even with the lowest dose of telmisartan available. The higher bioavailability of telmisartan suggests that lower doses of telmisartan should be considered when the drug is administered to patients with hepatic impairment.",0,0
563,11185635,Pharmacokinetics of a single 120-mg dose of telmisartan administered during and between hemodialysis in subjects with severe renal insufficiency: comparison with healthy volunteers.,,"Stangier, J; Su, C A; Brickl, R; Franke, H","The pharmacokinetics of telmisartan 120 mg orally evaluated in subjects with severe renal insufficiency between dialysis and during hemodialysis were compared to those observed in healthy male subjects. Between dialyses and during dialysis, the plasma concentration-time curves of subjects with renal insufficiency were lower than those of healthy subjects. The mean plasma protein binding of telmisartan was 99.5% in healthy subjects, compared to mean values of 99.1% between dialyses and 98.8% during dialysis. Only very small amounts of telmisartan were removed by dialysis. Single doses of 120 mg telmisartan were well tolerated in subjects with severe renal impairment when administered between dialysis or during dialysis, and no clinically relevant changes in vital signs were detected. In conclusion, the peak plasma concentrations of telmisartan and the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves in subjects with severe renal impairment were markedly reduced compared to healthy subjects. The fraction of telmisartan that is not bound to plasma proteins increased approximately two-fold. Changes in the pharmacokinetic profile in subjects with renal impairment did not affect the safety profile of telmisartan, which was well tolerated in these subjects.",0,0

After a 28-day placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to 28 days of once-daily, double-blind, double-dummy treatment with 40, 80, or 120 mg telmisartan; enalapril 20mg; or placebo. Blood pressure (BP) was recorded manually for 12 hours after the first dose and after 24 hours at baseline (Day 0), Day 1, and Day 28 of double-blind treatment. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were evaluated from plasma concentrations of telmisartan. All doses of telmisartan and enalapril significantly lowered BP compared with placebo (p < or = 0.01). Mean +/- SE reductions in supine DBP after 28 days of treatment ranged from 7.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg to 9.8 +/- 1.3 mmHg in the telmisartan groups, 9 .6 +/- 1.3 mmHg with enalapril and 1.5 +/- 1.3 mmHg with placebo Mean +/- SE reductions in supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) ranged from 10.0 +/- 2.2 mmHg and 15.5 +/- 2.2 mmHg with telmisartan vs. 10.2 +/- 2.1 mmHg with enalapril; placebo increased supine SBP by 3.5 +/- 2.1 mmHg. BP reductions after 4 weeks of treatment with telmisartan were not different from those achieved with enalapril. There was no significant linear trend in BP reduction between doses of telmisartan. Reductions in SBP and DBP were maintained over the 24-hour period at day 28. Supine heart rate was not affected by treatment. The minimum/maximum DBP ratios were > or = 85% for all doses of telmisartan versus 65% for enalapril. High inter-patient variability in plasma concentrations of telmisartan was observed. For example, the mean +/- SD values for Cmax were 159 +/- 104 ng/mL for telmisartan 40 mg, 693 +/- 606 ng/mL for telmisartan 80 mg, and 1635 +/- 1406 ng/mL for telmisartan 120 mg. Plasma concentration effect analyzes indicated that the antihypertensive effects of 40, 80, and 120 mg telmisartan are in the plateau region of the concentration-response curve. All active treatments were well tolerated, with similar tolerability profiles to placebo, and telmisartan did not produce any clinically relevant first-dose effects. These data confirm the antihypertensive efficacy and placebo-like tolerability of telmisartan.",0,0

To avoid the metabolic disturbances associated with high doses of HCTZ, blood pressure control can be achieved by combining low doses with another antihypertensive.; The study was conducted to assess the tolerability and antihypertensive dose-response efficacy of telmisartan and HCTZ and their combination in black patients with mild to moderate hypertension (supine mean arterial pressure 140/95-200/114 mmHg). ; After a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, 222 black patients were randomized to once-daily treatment with one of 20 different double-blind combinations of telmisartan (0, 20, 40, 80, 160 mg) and HCTZ (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25 mg) for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was measured at baseline and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks; Telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg reduced supine trough diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the primary efficacy parameter, by 13.3 mmHg and supine trough systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 21.5 mmHg. These reductions represented benefits of 13.7/8.7 mmHg over telmisartan 80 mg and 12.3/8.1 mmHg over HCTZ 12.5 mg (p < 0.01). Telmisartan 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg reduced supine trough SBP/DBP by 14.3/10.0 mmHg, amounting to 12.3/3.3 mmHg more than telmisartan 40 mg and 5.1/4, 8 mmHg more than HCTZ 12.5 mg. This reached significance for comparisons with telmisartan 40 mg for SBP and HCTZ 12.5 mg for DBP (p<0.05). A response surface analysis and therapeutic response rates confirmed the additive antihypertensive effects of telmisartan and HCTZ. All treatments were well tolerated, with side effect profiles comparable to placebo. Adverse events were mainly transient and mild to moderate in severity; Telmisartan 80 mg combined with HCTZ 12.5 mg is effective and well tolerated in black patients with mild to moderate hypertension, providing greater antihypertensive activity than corresponding monotherapies.",0,0

Although diltiazem is characterized as a HR-lowering calcium antagonist, no study has quantified the magnitude of HR changes in patients with angina or hypertension.; The study was conducted to explore the magnitude of the proportional reduction in HR at varying levels of resting HR with the sustained-release formulation of diltiazem (diltiazem SR) at the usual clinical doses of 200 or 300 mg once daily. ; This meta-analysis was performed on six double-blind comparative studies involving 771 patients with angina or hypertension in which diltiazem SR 200-300 mg once daily was compared with placebo or with other agents known not to influence HR ( angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). , diuretics). Sustained-release diltiazem reduces elevated basal HR, with an increasing effect at higher initial rates; Multiple comparisons by baseline HR category showed a significant difference between both groups for baseline HR of 74-84 beats/min and > or = 85 beats/min (p = 0.001). Sustained-release diltiazem had no significant HR-lowering effect on baseline HR < or = 74 beats/min, but appears to have a genuine regulatory effect on HR: it reduces tachycardia without inducing excessive bradycardia. These findings contrast with those of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, which tend to increase heart rate and have been associated with adverse outcome in acute cardiovascular conditions. At the same time, there is evidence to suggest that heart rate-lowering calcium channel blockers decrease rates of cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction; When the use of calcium channel blockers is indicated in patients with angina or hypertension, a HR-lowering agent, ie, diltiazem, should be recommended instead of dihydropyridine.",0,0

Additional references for selected articles were also retrieved.; Since most of the published CHF studies have been conducted with candesartan and losartan, these agents are the primary focus of this article. However, all identified comparative clinical studies were reviewed and included, regardless of the agent used; AgII receptor antagonists inhibit the effects of AgII at its receptor subtype 1, regardless of the pathway of AgII synthesis. They have a hemodynamic profile similar to that of ACE inhibitors, without reflex neurohormonal activation. They have been shown to be at least as effective as ACE inhibitors in improving symptoms, exercise capacity, and New York Heart Association functional class in patients with congestive heart failure. Although the ELITE (Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly) trial suggested that losartan improved survival compared with captopril, this study was not designed to analyze mortality. ELITE-II, an adequately powered study, showed no difference in mortality rates between patients taking captopril and those taking losartan. The combination of AgII receptor antagonists and ACE inhibitors provides additional benefit in lowering blood pressure and preventing ventricular remodeling. AgII receptor antagonists are well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse effects similar to or lower than that of ACE inhibitors. Its lack of effect on bradykinin degradation could explain its lower incidence of cough; The data accumulated to date in patients with CHF highlight that ACE inhibitors should remain the treatment of choice and that AgII receptor antagonists can be considered an acceptable alternative for patients who do not tolerate ACE inhibitors.",0,0
569,11201013,The role of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of elderly hypertensive patients.,,"Gosch, M","Hypertension has a high prevalence among elderly patients. Randomized trials have already shown that the treatment of healthy older people with hypertension is highly effective. However, some questions have arisen. On the one hand, the generalizability of the results of these trials, particularly to older people with serious medical comorbidities and poor performance status, is unclear. On the other hand, different antihypertensive drugs have been shown to be effective. Which drug for which patient? Even data from randomized intervention trials showing that treatment affects cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were lacking. ACE inhibitors have been used for more than a decade to treat high blood pressure. For a younger population, the captopril prevention project showed no difference between ACE inhibitors and conventional antihypertensive therapy (diuretics, beta-blockers) with respect to primary endpoints (myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular deaths). ). The STOP-2 study also confirmed these results for elderly patients. Physiological changes with age and comorbidities must be taken into account when treating elderly patients. Of importance among this group of patients is decreased renal function. Admissions for uremia that are related to the use of ACE inhibitors are still common, although many cases are preventable by monitoring kidney function, but guidelines are still lacking. Regarding comorbidities, ACE inhibitors have benefits compared to other antihypertensive drugs, especially in cases of heart failure, diabetes and coronary heart disease.",0,0

Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were measured using a constant infusion technique. The reference substances used were [131I]iodohippurate (Hippuran) and [125I]iothalamate. The lithium clearance method was used to measure renal water and sodium handling. Microalbuminuria was measured. A subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken and the relationship between the thickness of the media and the diameter of the lumen of the small resistance vessels was determined. Left ventricular mass index was determined by echocardiography. Thirty-seven patients with newly diagnosed or poorly controlled essential hypertension were randomized to treatment with regimens based on isradipine, perindopril, or hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride. Atenolol and hydralazine were added as secondary and tertiary agents, respectively, when necessary to normalize diastolic blood pressure. The investigations were carried out before and after 9 months of normalization of blood pressure. Renal function in untreated hypertensive patients was characterized by increased renal vascular resistance, decreased renal blood flow, normal glomerular filtration fraction, and normal serum creatinine. No association was found between the structure of the peripheral resistance vessels in the subcutaneous vessels and renal hemodynamic parameters. Patients with severe left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass > 360 g) had a lower glomerular filtration fraction, higher renal vascular resistance, lower renal blood flow, and increased microalbuminuria compared with patients with less pronounced cardiac changes. After 1 year of treatment, which had a profound effect on the structure of the heart and vessels, renal hemodynamics remained unchanged in patients receiving antihypertensive treatment regimens based on the ACE inhibitor perindopril or the calcium antagonist isradipine. While renal plasma flow was reduced, glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction preserved were significantly increased in those treated with a diuretic-based regimen.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the validity of BP measured at home for the follow-up and control of patients with arterial hypertension in homogeneous treatment. An additional objective was to establish the degree of BP control obtained in the office. This is a prospective, longitudinal, observational and multicenter study in a cohort of 156 patients of both sexes, older than 18 years and with essential hypertension. All of them received the fixed combination of enalapril/HCTZ 20/6 mg as the only antihypertensive agent for at least 4 previous weeks. Office BP was the average of three measurements. For home BP, a semiautomatic device (OMRON HEM 705 CP) was used. The patients measured their BP twice a day for 2 consecutive days. The average differences between the two measurement methods were low, but significant: 3.99 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP; p < 0.05), 2.02 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP; p < 0.05). Pearson's regression coefficient between office and home values was highly significant (p < 0.0001) for SBP, DBP, and heart rate. Home BP measurement was highly reproducible, as evidenced by the high within-class correlation coefficient for individual measurements on the first compared with the second day: 0.88 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.82-0.92; p < 0.00001) for SBP and 0.89 for DBP (95% CI 0.83-0.93; p < 0.00001). The percentage of patients with strict control of DBP and SBP in consultation (<140/90 mmHg) was 61.3% and with DBP control (<90 mmHg) 92%.

575,11213857,review of budesonide inhalation suspension in the treatment of pediatric asthma.,,"Szefler, S J","Asthma is recognized as an inflammatory disease and inhaled corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment in patients with persistent disease. Until recently, no inhaled corticosteroids were approved in the United States for children 4 years of age and younger, and no practical dosage form was available for infants and young children who could not use metered-dose inhalers effectively. Budesonide inhalation suspension (BIS) is a glucocorticoid with high topical and low systemic activity. In children 12 months to 8 years old, BIS improves asthma symptoms and lung function and decreases the need for advanced bronchodilators. Long-term follow-up studies in children concluded that BIS is well tolerated, with little or no effect on growth and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. Therefore, it is a valuable therapeutic alternative to systemic corticosteroid therapy in infants and young children.",0,0

577,11217909,ACE gene polymorphism and cough threshold for capsaicin after cilazapril use.,,"Takahashi, T; Yamaguchi, E; Furuya, K; Kawakami, Y","Persistent dry cough is an occasional but clinically important adverse reaction to angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs). Its reported incidence is variable, and it is not clear why the cough occurs only in certain individuals. An insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with serum ACE activity. We have previously shown that ACE inhibitor-induced cough susceptibility is associated with this polymorphism, such that patients with genotype II are more susceptible to cough than patients with other genotypes. To confirm and extend our previous observation, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study in 10 healthy volunteers with genotype II and 10 with genotype DD. Cough threshold was determined by the concentration of inhaled capsaicin that caused two or more coughs. Following use of an ACEI, cilazapril, for 4 weeks, changes in cough threshold in subjects with genotype II [before: 6.6+/-3.7 nM (mean+/-SD); after: 5.0+/-4.6 nM] differed significantly from DD genotype subjects (before: 9.0+/-9.4 nM; after: 9.3+/-9.1 nM). Skin responses to intradermal bradykinin, which is a substrate of ACE and cough-producing, were significantly increased in genotype II subjects (before: 1.6+/-0.6 vs. after: 2.6+/-0 0.5 cm2, P<0.05) but not in subjects with DD genotype (before: 1.4+/-0.5 vs. after: 1.6+/-0.6 cm2, ns) after use of cilazapril . In contrast, skin responses to intradermal substance P did not change in subjects with either genotype. These findings provide additional evidence for a link between ACEI-induced cough and the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene and suggest that ACEIs induce cough by modulating the tissue level of bradykinin.",0,0

Another less appreciated potential drawback is its propensity to cause weight gain in some patients. In 8 evaluable prospective randomized controlled trials lasting ≥ 6 months, body weight was greater in the beta-blocker group than in the control group at study endpoint. The mean difference in body weight was 1.2 kg (range -0.4 to 3.5 kg). A regression analysis suggested that beta-blockers were associated with initial weight gain during the first few months. Thereafter, no additional weight gain was evident compared to controls. There was no relationship between demographic characteristics and changes in body weight.

Patients (n = 149) scheduled for CABG were randomized 4 weeks before surgery. Study medication was used from randomization to 1 year after CABG. Exercise testing was performed at randomization; the stress test was repeated 1 year after CABG and the patients underwent a 48-hour Holter. Clinical ischemic events were recorded and defined as death, revascularization, myocardial infarction, recurrence of angina pectoris, ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Total exercise time increased overall by 75 +/- 76 seconds 1 year after CABG (placebo +79 +/- 75 seconds, quinapril +72 +/- 79 seconds, p = 0.6).

586,11232737,Management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the elderly: special considerations.,,"Rosenstock, J","The principles of managing type 2 diabetes mellitus in the elderly do not differ from those in younger patients, but therapeutic priorities and strategies must be carefully individualized. The goals of treatment are to improve glycemic control in a stepwise approach involving nonpharmacologic methods including diet and exercise, and pharmacologic therapy that includes mixtures of oral antihyperglycemic agents alone or in combination with insulin. Although the goals of treatment may be the same for older and younger patients, certain aspects of type 2 diabetes in the elderly require special consideration. Treatment decisions are influenced by age and life expectancy, comorbid conditions, and severity of vascular complications. Adherence to dietary therapy, physical activity, and medication regimens may be compromised by comorbid conditions and psychosocial limitations. Drug-induced hypoglycemia has been the main consideration and the most serious potential complication. Furthermore, the long-term macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes are a source of significant morbidity and mortality. In fact, vascular and neuropathic complications are already present at the time of diagnosis in a significant number of patients, and the impact of better diabetes control depends on the patient's age and life expectancy. Age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and the potential for adverse effects and drug interactions should also be considered when choosing the appropriate drug therapy. In general, a conservative and gradual approach is suggested for the treatment of the elderly patient with type 2 diabetes; treatment may be initiated with monotherapy, followed by early intervention with a combination of oral agents including a sulfonylurea as a background insulin secretagogue, plus a supplemental insulin sensitizer. Insulin therapy is eventually required if significant hyperglycemia [glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) > 8%] persists despite oral combination therapy. Combination therapy with evening insulin and a long-acting sulfonylurea such as glimepiride is an effective strategy to improve hyperglycemia in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes in whom polypharmacy with oral agents is unsuccessful. Furthermore, such a regimen is easy to follow for the patient who cannot adhere to a more complicated insulin regimen. Hyperglycaemia in the elderly can be well controlled with practical intervention and a simple treatment plan to improve compliance. Optimal glycemic control should be possible for all patients if treatment is individualized; however, tight glycemic control may not be achievable in all patients or even desirable in many elderly patients.",0,0

Personalization of drug therapy offers the potential for optimal safety and efficacy in an individual patient. Such a process is in contrast to current prescribing practices, which use drugs that have been shown to be safe and effective in patient populations or are based on anecdotal experience. Within patient populations, medications vary in their efficacy among individual patients. More importantly, a drug that is safe and effective in one patient may be ineffective or even harmful in another. Behind many of these phenotypic differences are genotypic variants (polymorphisms) of key enzymes and proteins that affect the safety and efficacy of a drug in an individual patient. Understanding these polymorphisms has the potential to improve patient care by allowing clinicians to personalize drug selection to meet individual patient needs. Pharmacogenomics may also lead to better compliance and a shorter time to optimal disease management, reducing morbidity and mortality. Significant cost savings could be realized from reductions in polypharmacy, as well as fewer physician visits and hospitalizations for exacerbations of underlying diseases and due to adverse drug reactions.",0,0

LVEF and relevant biochemical measurements were performed before discharge and after 3 months. Overall LVEF increased during the study period from a median of 35 to 39% (P<0.001). There was no difference between patients taking aspirin and warfarin with respect to the primary endpoint, LVEF. Furthermore, neither endothelin-1 nor ANP showed significant differences between the treatment groups. A possible interaction between ACE-I and aspirin could theoretically lead to reduced levels of renin activity in patients taking aspirin, but we found no difference between groups. In conclusion, we found no evidence of an interaction between ACE-I and low-dose aspirin.",0,0

We analyzed death and unplanned readmissions for heart failure per month; This initial report of the first 70 patients (67% male, 71% systolic dysfunction with a mean ejection fraction of 31.0+/-6.7%) enrolled in this study demonstrates the elimination of 1-month hospital readmission in the RC and MC groups. This unexpected result represents a dramatic improvement both for this patient cohort (20% readmission rate at 30 days prior to enrollment reduced to 0% after index admission in both care groups) and compared to available data ; Critical contributors to this improvement appear to be specialist cardiology care, meeting clinical stability criteria prior to discharge, and routine use of high-dose or targeted ACE inhibitor therapy prior to discharge. Widespread application of this approach may have a dramatic improvement in the morbidity of congestive heart failure while limiting the rising costs of this condition.",0,0

598,11248763,Heart failure therapy at the turn of the century.,,"Goldstein, S","Major changes have occurred in the treatment of heart failure in the last fifty years that have had a dramatic effect on its morbidity and mortality. More than two hundred years have passed since the demonstration of the benefit of digitalis in heart failure until the development of powerful loop diuretics. The observation that vasodilators could improve both cardiac function and mortality led to the investigation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). Although these agents had significant vasodilatory properties, their main benefit appears to be related to their ability to effect remodeling of the failing left ventricle. The most recent randomized clinical trials demonstrate that beta-adrenergic blocking agents may provide an incremental effect on both mortality and morbidity when added to ACEI therapy. Although these agents have improved the outlook for the heart failure patient, they have had little effect on improving left ventricular function. Future research should be directed at methods to address this problem, either by changing the contractile properties of the cardiomyocyte by pharmacological or electrical therapy or by transplanting functional cells that can increase the number of functioning contractile units.",0,0

All patients underwent reperfusion therapy.; Echocardiography was performed on day 1 (before randomization), day 14, and day 90 after myocardial infarction. Left ventricular volume and ejection fraction were measured and wall motion analyzes performed at all three time points in 249 patients and at baseline in an additional 12 patients who died during follow-up. Echocardiographic and non-echocardiographic predictors of ventricular recovery were examined; By day 90, 55 of 252 (22%) patients who had abnormal ejection fraction and wall motion abnormalities at day 1 demonstrated complete recovery of function (ejection fraction in the normal range and segment length of 0% myocardial infarction, and an additional 36% (91 of 252 patients) demonstrated partial recovery of function.

Many questions remain about the categories of patients who benefit from the use of ACE inhibitors; Clarify the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with kidney disease.; A review of the literature focused on various kidney diseases, ACE inhibitors and cost-effectiveness criteria was carried out; Almost 100 clinical studies were reviewed. ACE inhibitor therapy appears to have beneficial effects in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus with nephropathy, AIDS nephropathy, and other non-diabetic kidney diseases. The use of these agents in these diseases decreases the progression of kidney disease and the need for dialysis, generating potential cost savings and improving quality of life. Data supporting ideal blood pressures indicate the need to aggressively lower this risk factor. The use of ACE inhibitors is dangerous in bilateral renal artery stenosis, particularly with volume depletion, but may be of value in patients with unilateral stenosis. In African Americans, treatment with ACE inhibitors is likely to be beneficial, although the doses required may be higher than for whites, and caution should be exercised in certain situations. The potential efficacy of angiotensin receptor blockers and other new drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system is evaluated; The use of ACE inhibitors has benefits in kidney disease states characterized by increased glomerular perfusion pressure; its use in other states of renal disease, particularly those characterized by reduced glomerular perfusion pressure, may be risky. The benefits conferred by ACE inhibitor therapy are so dramatic in terms of cost savings and improved quality of life that their use in certain clinical situations should be strongly recommended in managed care and other practice settings.",0,0

Dose-related adverse drug events (ADEs) frequently cause compliance problems, and many ADEs occur with initial doses of antihypertensive medications. Therefore, it is an established principle to initiate low-dose antihypertensive therapy to avoid ADEs that decrease patients' quality of life and reduce compliance. However, what are the lowest effective doses of antihypertensive drugs? To compare the initial doses recommended in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) with those recommended by the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee for the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC VI); Review of the latest JNC VI report (1997) and the 1999 and 2000 editions of the PDR and the medical literature.; JNC VI recommends substantially lower starting doses for 23 (58%) of 40 drugs, compared to the PDR. Additionally, for 37 (82%) of 45 medications, the PDR guidelines do not suggest lower starting doses for elderly or frail patients than for younger adults; Although the PDR is the most widely used reference drug by clinicians, it does not reflect the lower starting doses recommended by JNC VI for many of the most widely prescribed antihypertensive drugs. Because avoidance of ADEs is essential to maintaining adherence to antihypertensive therapy, and because many antihypertensive ADEs are dose-related, clinicians need to be aware of the lowest, most effective, and least prone doses of ADEs.

Ventricular arrhythmias observed during exercise and after exercise for 10 minutes were analyzed using Lown's classification for rate and severity of ventricular arrhythmia. The mean duration of exercise showed a significant improvement with the ACE inhibitor compared to the control group (p < 0.05); however, there were no significant changes in arrhythmia grades. Serum electrolytes and other biochemical parameters were within the normal range.

Estimates with film magnetic resonance.,,"Konermann, M; Sanner, B M; Altmann, C; Laschewski, F; Rawert, B; Trappe, H J","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to be of value in the treatment of post-infarct remodeling. However, the question of whether substances with higher tissue affinity are associated with advantages for the acute and chronic course is still unclear; The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of ACE inhibitors with different tissue affinities on left ventricular wall remodeling in patients recovering from myocardial infarction.; 52 patients (17 women, 38 to 73 years of age) suffering from their first acute myocardial infarction were randomized to receive a daily dose of 25 to 75 mg of captopril or 10 to 20 mg of fosinopril, starting on the seventh day post-infarction. 28 patients had an anterior wall infarction and 24 patients an inferior wall infarction. Infarct size was determined by the integral method of creatine kinase. 50 patients were investigated by cine magnetic resonance imaging 1 and 26 weeks after infarction. The following parameters were determined: weight of the infarct and diastolic diameter of the infarcted zone, systolic wall stress, muscle mass, diastolic and systolic diameters, systolic wall thickening and motility of the non-infarcted myocardium; Infarct weight increased with captopril by 5.7% (p < 0.05) and with fosinopril by 6.1% (p < 0.05). The diastolic diameter of the infarcted area decreased by 12% with captopril (p < 0.001) and by 11% with fosinopril (p < 0.001). Systolic wall thickness increased by 12.1% (p < 0.001) and muscle mass by 12.7% (p < 0.001) with captopril and 15.4% (p < 0.001) and 9.6% (p < 0.01), respectively, with fosinopril. With captopril, the diastolic diameter increased by 2.3% (p < 0.05) and the systolic diameter by 17.8% (p < 0.01) and with fosinopril by 2.8% (ns) and 17. 5% (p < 0.001), respectively. Systolic wall thickening increased by 73.9% with captopril (p < 0.001) and 129.4% with fosinopril (p < 0.001). Motility decreased by 13.8% (p < 0.05) with captopril and 6.0% (ns) with fosinopril. For all parameters, the results observed in anterior wall infarction were considerably worse than those observed in inferior wall infarction. All differences between captopril and fosinopril were not significant; Captopril and fosinopril do not show major differences in their influence on left ventricular wall remodeling after myocardial infarction. On the basis of the present results, the tissue affinity of an ACE inhibitor does not appear to have significant relevance for post-infarction treatment.",0,0

Few clinical studies distinguish the effects of CCBs as monotherapy. We performed a comprehensive comparison of two CCBs in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. Thirty patients with pretreatment diastolic blood pressures > or = 100 mm Hg were randomly assigned to nifedipine-GITS or verapamil-SR. Dose titration achieved a diastolic blood pressure of < or = 95 mm Hg or a decrease of > or = 15 mm Hg over 4 weeks. Clinical blood pressure (BP), 24-hour ambulatory BP, exercise BP, left ventricular mass, systolic and diastolic function by echocardiography, and coronary flow reserve by split-dose thallium-201 imaging with adenosine were assessed at baseline, end of titration, 3 months, and 6 months of treatment. Plasma renin activity, atrial natriuretic peptide, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were analyzed. Both drugs caused similar reductions in clinical and 24-hour ambulatory BP and similar reductions in left ventricular mass index. Compared with nifedipine-GITS, verapamil-SR produced significantly lower maximum resting and exercise heart rates. Nifedipine-GITS caused a lower peak systolic BP during exercise. At the end of the titration, nifedipine-GITS produced lower levels of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, which were no longer evident at 6 months. Plasma norepinephrine was lower with verapamil-SR, also at the end of the titration and at 3 months, but not at 6 months. Plasma epinephrine and plasma renin activity did not change with either drug. There was no difference for left ventricular systolic or diastolic function or coronary flow reserve between the two treatments. Once daily, nifedipine-GITS and verapamil-SR are equally effective in lowering blood pressure in moderate to severe hypertension.

Subjects were recruited from patients attending other outpatient clinics and entered the study if their SBP was greater than 150 mm Hg after three visits. Patients were given a low and high dose of each of the major drug classes or placebo for 1 month each. The study was a randomized balanced crossover design with five periods: placebo; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; beta blocker drugs; calcium blocking drugs; and thiazide diuretics. Blood pressure (BP) was measured 24 to 26 hours after the previous dose. A side effect questionnaire was administered at each visit. Seventy-four patients entered the study. Beta blockers could not be used in 15 patients due to asthma or bronchospasm and these had two placebo periods. There were 9 of 66 patients with P, 9 of 46 with beta-blockers, 4 of 65 with calcium-blocking drugs, 4 of 65 with diuretics, and 1 of 62 patients with ACE inhibitors who did not progress to the higher dose due to side effects. secondary. Decreases in SBP compared to randomized placebo were calcium blocking drugs 15 mm Hg = diuretics 13 mm Hg > ACE inhibitors 8 mm Hg = beta blockers 5 mm Hg. Blood pressure decrease correlated with placebo BP (p < 0.0005, r = 0.53 to 0.70). When corrected for placebo, target SBP (<140 mm Hg) was achieved in 6% to 15% of patients on monotherapy. Sequential monotherapy achieved the goal in 29%. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium blockers, and diuretics had no more side effects than placebo. Patients on beta-blockers had more side effects and their well-being score was reduced. Diuretics and calcium blockers are more effective in elderly patients in lowering systolic blood pressure. Beta blockers were relatively ineffective, frequently contraindicated, and had more side effects. Monotherapy achieved control in only a small number of patients. In the elderly with essential hypertension, treatment with diuretics or calcium blockers should be instituted, but combination therapy will usually be required to achieve the goal.",0,0

Women demonstrated greater abnormalities of hemorheologic indices and vWF than men (all P < 0.05). Plasma viscosity (P = 0.009) and fibrinogen (P = 0.0014) levels were higher in patients with more severe symptoms (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III-IV), but there was no relationship with left ventricular ejection fraction.

625,11288962,Angiotensin receptor blockers: evidence to preserve target organs.,,"Carson, P; Giles, T; Higginbotham, M; Hollenberg, N; Kannel, W; Siragy, H M","Hypertension is a major problem throughout the developed world. Although current antihypertensive treatment regimens reduce morbidity and mortality, patients are often noncompliant and medications may not fully normalize blood pressure. As a result, current therapy often fails to prevent or reverse the cardiovascular remodeling that often occurs when blood pressure is chronically elevated. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is effective in controlling hypertension and treating congestive heart failure. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibit RAS activity, but these two classes of antihypertensive drugs have different mechanisms of action and different pharmacological profiles. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors block only one pathway in the production of angiotensin II (Ang II). Furthermore, angiotensin I is not the only substrate for ACE. ACE inhibitors also block bradykinin degradation which may have potential benefits in cardiovascular disease. However, bradykinin is the presumed cause of cough associated with ACE inhibitor therapy. Data from clinical trials on ACE inhibitors serve to support the role of the RAS in the development of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin receptor blockers act distally on the RAS to selectively block the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor. Therefore, ARBs are more targeted agents and avoid many side effects. Experimental and clinical trials have documented the efficacy of ARBs in preserving target organ function and reversing cardiovascular remodeling. In some cases, maximum benefit from Ang II blockade can be obtained using ARBs and ACE inhibitors. This review describes clinical trials documenting the efficacy of ARBs in protecting the myocardium, blood vessels, and renal vasculature.",0,0

At 13 months (n = 257), more patients (p < 0.001) were still on nifedipine (94/154 [61.0%]) or verapamil (22/35 [62.9%]) monotherapy than hydrochlorothiazide ( 10/39 [25.6%]). %]) or enalapril (1/29 [3.4%]). A sustained decrease in left ventricular mass was achieved (p < 0.001) with no differences between groups at 4 and 13 months; In contrast to current recommendations, calcium channel blockers are more effective than thiazides as initial treatment in blacks with hypertension. If treatment is initiated with thiazides or enzyme-converting inhibitors, combination therapy to control blood pressure and reduce left ventricular mass is more likely to be required.",1,1

The objectives of the study were to comparatively evaluate the efficacy of treatment with nicorandil (a new balanced vasodilator) and enalapril on LV volume, mass, and function in patients with mildly symptomatic chronic rheumatic mitral regurgitation; Eighty-seven mildly symptomatic rheumatic patients with severe MR were enrolled in this prospective randomized study. All patients underwent serial echocardiography at admission and again at six months. Eighty patients completed the study.; At six months, the nicorandil and enalapril groups of patients had a significant reduction in LV end-systolic volume index (57.4 +/- 24.8 vs. 43.2 +/- 20.7 mL/m2, p = 0.003, 50.0 +/- 19.0 vs. 40.4 +/- 14.2 mL/m2, p = 0.006, respectively) and LV mass index (218.0 +/- 88.0 vs. 188.0 +/- 76.0 g/m2, p = 0.05, 217.2 +/- 48.0 versus 186.2 +/- 45.0 g/m2, p = 0.002 respectively).

Ramipril also reduced the incidence of the triple composite endpoint of cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction, or development of heart failure (p = 0.046). Cox regression analysis, controlling for baseline LVEF and ramipril assignment, revealed: 1) increases in EDVI and ESLV up to three months predicted an increased risk of a future adverse clinical outcome; and 2) that the benefit of ramipril on clinical outcome depended in part on a reduction in LV volumes; Even in this group of patients, LV dilation can occur and lead to an adverse clinical outcome. Ramipril reduces the postoperative increase in LV volumes and thus may improve clinical outcome.",1,0

Unit costs of amlodipine and enalapril were applied to individual patient daily doses to calculate total costs and average costs per patient in each treatment group in the intention-to-treat clinical trial. Efficacy rates were used to calculate average treatment costs per successful blood pressure control. Although not statistically significant, treatment with amlodipine resulted in greater efficacy (89.5%) compared to enalapril (85.2%). Average costs per patient treated with amlodipine were consistently lower ($112.30) than for the patient treated with enalapril at week 50. Treatment with amlodipine resulted in an average cost per success of $609 per patient compared to $772 per patient treated with enalapril. A sensitivity analysis revealed that, in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension over the 50-week treatment period, amlodipine would still be less expensive than enalapril, with the cost of enalapril decreasing by up to 17%, and it would still be more economical. cost-effective, with a 21% decrease in the cost of enalapril.",0,0

However, a variety of studies have suggested that the positive relationship between BP and cardiovascular mortality is weakened or even reversed in the elderly. Most intervention trials to date have excluded or have not recruited enough patients older than 80 years to determine whether there is a significant benefit of treatment in this age group. A meta-analysis of intervention trials recruiting patients older than 80 years suggested a benefit in terms of stroke reduction, but also raised the possibility of an increase in total mortality. Therefore, the benefit/risk balance must be clearly established before recommendations can be made for the treatment of very elderly patients with hypertension. The Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) pilot recruited 1,283 patients over 80 years of age and showed the feasibility of conducting such a trial in this age group. It was a prospective, randomized, open-label, endpoint (PROBE) design, but the main trial has additional pharmaceutical sponsorship to conduct a double-blind trial. Therefore, the main trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the benefits of treating very elderly patients with hypertension. It compares placebo with a low-dose diuretic (sustained-release indapamide 1.5 mg daily) and additional treatment with an ACE inhibitor (perindopril) if necessary. As in the pilot trial, the primary endpoint is stroke (fatal and non-fatal), and the trial is designed to determine whether or not there is a 35% difference between placebo and active treatment. The primary goal will be achieved with 90% power at the 1% significance level. Secondary outcome measures will include total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiac mortality, stroke mortality, and skeletal fracture. 2,100 patients aged > or = 80 years will be recruited and followed up for an average of 5 years. Entry BP criteria after a 2-month single-blind placebo trial period are a sustained sitting systolic BP (SBP) of 160 to 199 mm Hg and a diastolic BP of 90 to 109 mm Hg. Standing SBP should be >140 mm Hg. The trial will be carried out in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice. We describe in detail the protocol for the main trial and discuss the reasons for the pilot changes, the use of the drug regimen, and the PA criteria to be used in the trial.",0,0

Patients with renal insufficiency had a substantially increased risk of cardiovascular death (11.4% vs. 6.6%) and total mortality (17.8% vs. 10.6%) (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The effect of renal failure on the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.16 to 1.69]) was independent of known cardiovascular risks and treatment. Ramipril reduced the incidence of the primary outcome in patients with and without renal failure (hazard ratio, 0.80 vs. 0.79; P > 0.2 for difference); In patients who had preexisting vascular disease or diabetes combined with an additional cardiovascular risk factor, mild renal failure significantly increased the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events.

Mean nocturnal BP fell from 133/85 mm Hg with placebo to 124/78 mm Hg with enalapril and 126/77 mm Hg with losartan. Daytime BP averaged 157/101 mm Hg with placebo and was significantly lower during enalapril treatment (142/91 mm Hg) than during losartan treatment (147/95 mm Hg). Clinical BP, measured 2 to 4 hours after drug intake, was reduced to the same extent with both drugs. Changes in BP induced by losartan were significantly related to those obtained with enalapril (0.63 < r < 0.93). Ambulatory BP monitoring was repeated after 4 weeks of combined treatment in six patients. The BP lowering effect of the combination was not significantly better than that achieved with enalapril alone. In conclusion, losartan 50 mg once daily and enalapril 20 mg once daily lower BP to approximately the same extent, except for a more pronounced effect of enalapril on daytime ambulatory BP.

There was a well-tolerated reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). There were no significant adverse drug events. Only sitting SBP and DBP were significantly decreased with fosinopril and verapamil SR. Because lowering both SBP and DBP in the elderly with hypertension has been shown to be beneficial, these findings take on added importance when considering the choice of medication for antihypertensive treatment in the elderly. The increase in norepinephrine in patients treated with fosinopril may explain why patients treated with long-term ACE inhibitors alone or in combination with diuretics rarely complain of orthostatic symptoms.",0,0

After 10 weeks of treatment with fosinopril 20 and 40 mg once daily, sustained decreases in PCWP, MABP, SVR, and heart rate and increases in CI and stroke volume index were observed (P < or = 0.05 v group 1 mg for PCWP and MABP at most time points and P < or = 0.05 v baseline for other parameters at most time points). Dose-related trends toward reduced use of supplemental diuretics (P = 0.027) and reduced symptoms of dyspnea (P = 0.008) were observed with the 20 mg and 40 mg fosinopril dose groups. Once daily administration of fosinopril 20 and 40 mg was safe and well tolerated, it provided a sustained beneficial hemodynamic effect, improved left ventricular performance, and reduced symptoms of dyspnea, resulting in less need for supplemental diuretic therapy. .",0,0
649,11329107,Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme therapy on QT interval dispersion.,,"Ranade, V; Molnar, J; Khokher, T; Agarwal, A; Mosnaim, A; Somberg, J C","Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) are at increased risk of sudden death. This increased risk has been associated with a greater dispersion of the QT interval (QTd), a reflection of the heterogeneity in ventricular repolarization. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been reported to reduce heart size and decrease morbidity and mortality in moderate to severe CHF. The objective of this study was to determine if ACE therapy is associated with a decrease in QTd, a marker of increased electrical instability. 97 patients were evaluated. Normalized QTd after 2 months of ACE therapy decreased from 16 +/- 4 to 12 +/- 3, a 25% reduction in dispersions. QTd also decreased from 61 +/- 14 to 47 +/- 12 (P < 0.001), and QTc spreads decreased from 71 +/- 18 to 52 +/- 14 (P < 0.001). After 2 months of ACE inhibitor treatment, heart rate was significantly reduced (RR intervals 765 +/- 198 before and 838 +/- 186 after ACE). There was a negative correlation between ejection fraction and QTd (r = -0.8, P < 0.001). The study also found no correlation between the level of ACE, the percentage of inhibition of the converting enzyme and QTd. The effects of ACE therapy appear early in terms of repolarization changes. The reduction in QTd may explain the reduction in mortality due to sudden death in patients with heart failure receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors.",0,0

Polypharmacy and patient noncompliance are often found in the care of these patients. These problems, along with a variety of age-related physiological changes and the presence of multiple medical illnesses, place the elderly at increased risk for adverse drug reactions. Of particular concern is the use of long-acting benzodiazepines and anticholinergic medications in this population. The problem of adverse drug reactions is a common clinical problem that is of great public concern as the number of older people in the United States continues to grow.

Patients were followed for at least one month after admission.; The mean age of the patients (11 men, 14 women) was 74 +/- 13 years. Five patients were diabetic. On admission, serum potassium was 7.7 +/- 0.7 mmol/L and serum creatinine 3.8 +/- 1.8 mg/dL; these values were significantly higher than the most recent follow-up laboratory measurements (4.6 +/- 0.5 mmol/l and 1.9 +/- 1.2 mg/dl, respectively) obtained 13 +/- 5 weeks before admission. Arterial pH on admission was 7.3 +/- 0.1 and plasma bicarbonate 18 +/- 5 mmol/L. The main causes of acute renal failure were dehydration (n = 12) and worsening heart failure (n = 9).

653,11331059,Formulation of clinical strategies for angiotensin antagonism: a review of preclinical and clinical studies.,,"Tabibiazar, R; Jamali, A H; Rockson, S G","Extensive animal studies and a growing number of human clinical trials have now definitively demonstrated the central role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the expression and modulation of cardiovascular disease. In contrast to the original hypothesis, the benefits of angiotensin antagonism do not emanate from the antihypertensive effect alone. Subsequent extensive investigations of angiotensin blockade suggest that the benefits of this approach may also result from pharmacological alteration of endothelial cell function and subsequent changes in the biology of the vasculature. The more recent availability of direct angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonists has introduced an element of uncertainty in this area of clinical decision making. The most widely studied receptor antagonists and converting enzyme inhibitors share many endpoint attributes. However, the partially overlapping mechanisms of action of the two classes of angiotensin antagonists confer distinct pharmacological properties, including side effect profiles, mechanisms of action, and theoretical salutary effects on the expression of cardiovascular disease. The current review will attempt to contrast the biology of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with angiotensin II receptor antagonism. A discussion of the differential effects of these drug classes on endothelial cell function and on the modulation of vascular disease will be used to provide a theoretical framework for clinical and therapeutic decision making.",0,0

Three hundred and ninety-five men and women aged 20 to 80 years with primary hypertension were randomized to an 8-week double-blind treatment period with candesartan cilexetil 8-16 mg or enalapril 10-20 mg once daily, with forced dose titration after 4 weeks. Noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure was measured for 36 h at baseline and after 8 weeks.

It is unclear whether racial differences in response to drug treatment contribute to differences in outcomes. To address this issue, we pooled and analyzed data from the Prevention and Treatment of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) studies, two large randomized trials comparing enalapril with placebo in patients with left ventricular dysfunction; We used a matched cohort design in which up to four white patients were matched to each black patient based on trial, treatment assignment, gender, left ventricular ejection fraction, and age. A total of 1196 white patients (580 from the prevention trial and 616 from the treatment trial) were compared with 800 black patients (404 from the prevention trial and 396 from the treatment trial). The median duration of follow-up was 35 months in the prevention trial and 33 months in the treatment trial.; Black patients and matched white patients had similar demographic and clinical characteristics, but black patients had higher rates of all-cause death (12.2 vs. 9.7 per 100 person-years) and hospitalization for heart failure ( 13.2 vs. 7.7 per year). 100 person-years). Despite similar drug doses in the two groups, enalapril therapy, compared with placebo, was associated with a 44% (95% confidence interval, 27% to 57%) reduction in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure among white patients (P < 0.001) but without a significant reduction among black patients (P = 0.74). At 1 year, enalapril therapy was associated with significant reductions from baseline in systolic blood pressure (by a mean [+/-SD] of 5.0+/-17.1 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (3 .6+/-10.6 mm Hg) among white patients, but not among black patients. No significant changes in the risk of death were observed in association with enalapril therapy in either group; Enalapril therapy is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure among white patients with left ventricular dysfunction, but not among similar black patients.

Sixty type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to take delapril 30 mg/day or manidipine 10 mg/day for 48 weeks, in an open-label design. Twenty-eight of thirty subjects in the delapril group and twenty-nine of thirty in the manidipine group completed the study. Urinary albumin excretion measured by urine albumin to creatinine ratio decreased significantly in both groups (112.0+/-60.9 to 95.3+/-64.9 mg/g and 108.5+/- 51.0 to 96.4+/-53.5 mg/g in the delapril and manidipine group, respectively, p < 0.05, by paired t-test).

After 48 weeks of treatment, two patients in the delapril group and one patient in the manidipine group developed normoalbuminuria (urine albumin:creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g) and one patient in each group progressed to overt kidney disease (urine albumin:creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g). : creatinine in urine > 300mg/g). There were no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, serum fructosamine, creatinine, potassium, and lipid profiles after 48 weeks of treatment in either group. Two cases in the delapril group withdrew during the study due to intolerable cough and one case in the manidipine group due to intolerable dizziness and headache. In conclusion, both delapril and manidipine are effective in reducing microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria.",0,0

All ISH patients were derived from a population screening program. Measurements of end-organ damage, performed initially and after 6 and 24 months of treatment, included measurements of aortic compliance, echocardiographic left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and diastolic function. Blood pressure was measured by ambulatory and office measurements. Of the 97 ISH subjects screened, 62 (30 lisinopril) completed the study per protocol. Office blood pressure decreased in both groups, but ambulatory outcomes decreased significantly with lisinopril treatment alone. Aortic compliance was significantly increased with lisinopril, as opposed to a decrease in placebo-treated subjects. The main effect of increased compliance occurred between 6 and 24 months, while ambulatory blood pressure changed mainly in the first 6 months of treatment. LVMI decreased in both treatment groups, with a significantly greater reduction in lisinopril-treated subjects. Left ventricular diastolic function did not show significant changes in either group. Vascular pathophysiologic changes in ISH (decreased aortic compliance) may improve with long-term lisinopril treatment, whereas values deteriorate further in placebo-treated subjects. These results, in one of the first studies that included treatment-naïve subjects with ISH alone, indicate that treatment with lisinopril might favorably influence the cardiovascular risk of ISH.",0,0
658,11336577,Amlodipine/benazepril: fixed-dose combination therapy for hypertension.,,"Faulkner, M A; Hilleman, D E","Myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and end-stage renal disease have been linked to inadequate blood pressure control. Despite overwhelming evidence that uncontrolled hypertension is responsible for a considerable number of adverse health-related outcomes, disease control remains largely suboptimal. Available data show that to achieve adequate blood pressure control, a large number of patients require therapy with more than one drug. Fixed-dose combination antihypertensive therapy has many advantages over other treatment options. Positive effects on blood pressure control, adherence rates, adverse effects, and cost have been identified. Amlodipine/benazepril (Lotrel, Novartis) is a fixed-dose combination product indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Although not currently recommended as first-line therapy, studies confirm that this combination of a long-acting calcium antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has substantial blood pressure-lowering capabilities. While adverse events tend to be more frequent with increasing doses of antihypertensive monotherapy, the rate of adverse events attributed to amlodipine/benazepril in clinical trials often correlates with rates attributed to placebo. Amlodipine/benazepril is able to maintain blood pressure control over a 24-hour period and appears to be minimally affected by occasional missed doses. Unlike the older calcium antagonists, amlodipine is unlikely to cause alterations in myocardial contractility. In addition, the amlodipine/benazepril combination product costs less than the same therapy given as individual components. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider amlodipine/benazepril therapy in appropriate patients after adequate trial of antihypertensive monotherapy.",0,0
659,11336618,The current state of antihypertensive treatments: towards the new millennium.,,"Hardman, T C; Lunnon, M W","In this brief review, we present a historical perspective on the treatment of hypertension, highlight some current issues, and look to the possible future of antihypertensive therapy. The distribution of blood pressure within the population adopts a continuous distribution, albeit somewhat skewed, so what constitutes hypertension? Conventionally, the disease has been defined as a blood pressure level > 140/90 mmHg. Accepting this 'arbitrary' definition implies that approximately a quarter of the adult population in the US is hypertensive [1]. This has significant implications in terms of the impact on public health. We know that treating hypertension can prevent the serious consequences of cardiovascular disease: stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, and kidney disease. Therefore, it is important that high blood pressure is detected and effectively lowered. To what level should blood pressure be lowered? Conventionally, a level of 120/80 mmHg has been used to define normotension, but there are indications that, in certain circumstances, this should not be the goal. The question also arises as to whether it matters how the blood pressure is treated. The choice of agent may ultimately depend on the presence of any concomitant conditions and risk factors. Evidence from recent trials has concluded that the therapy selected to treat elevated blood pressure should take into account the patient's overall cardiovascular risk profile [2].",0,0

An updated perspective on the proposed hazards.,,"Kizer, J R; Kimmel, S E","In the context of increasing popularity, postmarketing studies of calcium channel blockers have even suggested an increase in a variety of important adverse endpoints. However, the evidence was largely observational and large-scale trials capable of addressing our concerns were lacking. Clinical trials now support the safety and efficacy of long-acting dihydropyridines for patients with diabetic and uncomplicated hypertension, although conventional therapies and, in the latter case, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have superior evidence of benefit. In contrast, short-acting dihydropyridines should be avoided. In acute coronary syndromes, beta blockers continue to be the treatment of choice; the evidence for the non-dihydropyridines remains inconclusive. Stable angina requires beta-blockers as first-line therapy and non-dihydropyridines as second-line therapy, whereas in ventricular dysfunction, safety data for non-dihydropyridines are lacking. Initial reports of cancer, bleeding, and suicide have been contradicted by later data, making the associations uncertain or unlikely. The remaining questions await the completion of ongoing trials to better define the indications for these agents.",0,0

667,11368252,Treatment of hypertension in women of childbearing age and during pregnancy.,,"Magee, L A","Hypertension is found between 1 and 6% of young women. The goal of treatment is to reduce cardiovascular risk, the magnitude of which depends less on the absolute level of blood pressure (BP) than on associated cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension-related target organ damage, and/or concomitant disease. Lifestyle modifications are recommended for all hypertensive individuals. The BP threshold at which antihypertensive treatment should be initiated is based on absolute cardiovascular risk. Most young women are at low risk and do not need antihypertensive therapy. All antihypertensive agents appear to be equally effective; the choice depends on personal preference, social circumstances, and the effect of an agent on cardiovascular risk factors, end-organ damage, and/or concomitant disease. Although most agents are appropriate and well tolerated by young women, another consideration remains pregnancy, 50% of which are unplanned. A physician must be aware of a woman's birth control method and the potential for an antihypertensive agent to cause birth defects after inadvertent exposure early in pregnancy. Conversely, if an oral contraceptive is effective and well tolerated, but the woman's BP rises slightly, continuing the contraceptive and starting antihypertensive therapy may not be contraindicated, especially if the ability to plan pregnancy is important (e.g. eg, in type 1 diabetes mellitus). No commonly used antihypertensive drugs are known to be teratogenic, although ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists should be discontinued, and any antihypertensive medication should be continued during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefits outweigh potential reproductive risks. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy complicate 5% to 10% of pregnancies and are one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. The goal of treatment is to improve the outcome of the pregnancy. There is consensus that severe maternal hypertension (systolic BP > or = 170 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP > or = 110 mm Hg) should be treated immediately to prevent stroke, death, and possibly maternal eclampsia. Parenteral hydralazine may be associated with an increased risk of maternal hypotension and intravenous labetalol with neonatal bradycardia. There is no consensus on whether to treat mild to moderate hypertension in pregnancy: the risks of transient severe hypertension, antenatal hospitalization, proteinuria at delivery, and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome may decrease with treatment, but intrauterine fetal growth may also May decrease. altered, particularly by atenolol.

670,11377666,"Progression, remission, regression of chronic kidney diseases.",,"Ruggenenti, P; Schieppati, A; Remuzzi, G","The prevalence of chronic kidney disease is increasing worldwide. Most chronic kidney disease lacks specific treatment and progresses relentlessly to end-stage kidney disease. However, research in animals and people has helped to understand the mechanisms of this progression and has indicated possible preventive methods. The notion of renoprotection is becoming a combined approach to kidney diseases, the main measures being pharmacological control of blood pressure and reduction of proteinuria. Lowering blood lipids, smoking cessation, and tight glucose control for diabetes are also part of the multimodal protocol for the management of kidney patients. With available treatments, dialysis can be postponed for many patients with chronic kidney disease, but less dialysis should be the real goal; in other words, remission of the disease and regression of structural damage to the kidney. Experimental and clinical data support the idea that at least less dialysis is possible (and perhaps none at all for some patients).",0,0

We tested the hypothesis that losartan therapy added to a background of chronic (>3 months) maximum therapy with an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril 40 mg once daily) will result in additional Ang II antagonism in patients with heart failure. proteinuric chronic renal with hypertension.; Sixteen patients with moderately advanced proteinuric chronic renal failure completed a two-period randomized controlled crossover trial. Each period was one month with a two-week washout between periods. In one period, patients received lisinopril 40 mg qd along with other antihypertensive therapy, and in the other, losartan 50 mg qd was added to the aforementioned regimen. Hemodynamic measurements included ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABP; Spacelabs 90207), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with iothalamate clearance, and cardiac output using the helium-acetylene rebreathing technique. Plasma renin activity in the supine position and plasma aldosterone and protein in 24-hour urine were measured in all patients; Twelve patients had diabetic nephropathy and four had chronic glomerulonephritis. The mean age (+/- SD) was 53 +/- 9 years. Body mass index was 38 +/- 5.7 kg/m(2), and all but two patients were male. Seated cuff blood pressure was 156 +/- 18/88 +/- 12 mm Hg. Pulse rate was 77 +/- 11 per min and cardiac index was 2.9 +/- 0.5 L/min/m(2). Mean log 24-hour protein excretion/g creatinine or overall PAA did not change. The mean change in protein excretion attributable to losartan, subtracted from placebo, was +1% (95% CI, -20% to 28%, P = 0.89). Similarly, the change in systolic ambulatory blood pressure (SAP) was 4.6 mm Hg (-5.7 to 14.9, P = 0.95) and diastolic BP was 1.5 mm Hg ( -4.5 to 7.6, P = 0.59). No changes in cardiac output were observed. However, there was a mean 14% (95% CI, 3 to 26%, P = 0.017) increase in GFR attributable to losartan treatment.

673,11383751,Pharmacoeconomics of hypertension management: the place of combination therapy.,,"Ambrosioni, E","Pharmacological treatment of hypertension has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke, coronary events, heart failure, and progression of kidney disease. However, success rates in blood pressure control remain low among treated patients, while antihypertensive medication accounts for a significant and growing proportion of healthcare spending in many countries. Several influential pharmacoeconomic analyzes have confirmed the cost-effectiveness of conventional antihypertensive treatments, which generally involve diuretic or beta-blocker monotherapy, compared with alternative strategies. Recent research has shown that a considerable proportion of the total cost of antihypertensive treatment in general practice is due to factors such as inadequate blood pressure control, poor adherence to therapy, discontinuation, and switching between therapies. These factors operate to a much lesser extent in well-conducted clinical trials and have not been fully incorporated in most economic studies. Some novel strategies, particularly low-dose combinations of antihypertensive agents, may offer advantages in terms of efficacy, reduced adverse effects, and improved adherence to treatment. Therefore, there is a need for comprehensive pharmacoeconomic analyzes of novel strategies, which take these additional factors into account. Until such studies are available, the wider use of low-dose combination therapy and other novel strategies should not be stopped on the basis of earlier economic studies that have not included all relevant considerations.",0,0

CAP produced a significant early and brief fall in BP, whereas the hypotensive response to the first dose with FOS did not differ significantly from placebo. Baseline plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was similar in all groups. Only CAP showed a sharp and significant drop in plasma ACE activity, whereas FOS and placebo did not change ACE activity.

Perindopril 4 to 8 mg once daily significantly reduces supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline in hypertensive patients. These reductions are maintained for at least 24 hours, as evidenced by min/max ratios of >50%. Vascular abnormalities associated with hypertension improved or normalized during treatment with perindopril. Perindopril 4 to 8 mg once daily significantly decreased carotid-femoral aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), improved arterial compliance, reduced left ventricular mass index, and in patients with recent cerebral ischemia and/or stroke , preserved cerebral blood flow despite significantly reducing SBP and DBP. Further research is needed to establish the significance of the promising results showing that reductions in aortic PWV were associated with reduced mortality in patients with ESRD, one-third of whom received perindopril. Response rates (number of patients with supine PAD < or = 90 mm Hg) were significantly higher with perindopril 4 to 8 mg once daily (67 to 80%) than captopril 25 to 50 mg twice per day (44 to 57%) in 3 double-blind randomized trials. In other clinical trials, the antihypertensive effects of perindopril were similar to those of other ACE inhibitors (including enalapril) and calcium channel antagonists. Combination therapy with perindopril and an antihypertensive agent from another treatment class provided additional benefit, either as first-line therapy or in patients who did not respond to monotherapy. Perindopril monotherapy was also effective in elderly patients and in patients with hypertension and concomitant diseases. Perindopril has an adverse event profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors; cough is the most common event reported during treatment and is also the most common adverse event responsible for treatment discontinuation; Perindopril is a well-tolerated ACE inhibitor that is significantly better than captopril (in terms of response rates) in the treatment of hypertension and as effective as other ACE inhibitors. Perindopril appears to reverse some of the vascular abnormalities associated with hypertension, including arterial stiffness and left ventricular hypertrophy, although further research is needed to confirm promising results regarding its ability to decrease associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The results of the ongoing studies will help confirm the place of perindopril in the treatment of hypertension; currently, it is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.",0,0

685,11406907,Antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of low-dose perindopril/indapamide combination compared with losartan in the treatment of essential hypertension.,,"Chanudet, X; De Champvallins, M","The objective of the study was to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of the low-dose combination of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril 2 mg plus the diuretic indapamide 0.625 mg (P/I) compared to the angiotensin II antagonist losartan. 50 mg (L50) in the treatment of essential hypertension. Patients (n = 277) were randomized, double-blind, and assigned to receive P/I or L50 once daily for a 12-week period. The response and normalization rates in the two groups were compared using a chi 2 test. The results of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were compared using a one-tailed Student's t-test. Normalization rates were significantly higher in the P/I group (76.0%) than in the L50 group (60.0%) (p = 0.009). Responder rates were significantly higher in the P/I group (91.7%) than in the L50 group (81.8%) (p = 0.025). Mean blood pressure reductions were: in SBPs (P/I-L50 = -2.4 mmHg; CI: 6.2, 1.3) and DBPs (P/I-L50 = -2.0 mmHg; CI : -4.2, 0.2). The mean decrease in nocturnal SBP (ABPM) was significantly greater in the P/I group (p = 0.041). Tolerability was comparable between the two groups in terms of treatment-emergent adverse events (12.4% for P/I patients and 8.4% for L50 patients). Laboratory evaluations did not show significant variations. It was concluded that the low dose P/I combination had significantly higher response and normalization rates than L50. This study also confirmed the good tolerability of both treatments.",0,0
686,11410114,Lisinopril improves endothelial function in chronic cigarette smokers.,,"Butler, R; Morris, A D; Struthers, A D","Smoking is a pernicious risk factor for the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease, and endothelial dysfunction is an important antecedent in this process. This is important, since cigarette smoke is directly toxic to endothelial cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to improve endothelial function in diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, and are a promising option for smokers. We treated 23 subjects (age 38+/-12 years; mean+/-SD) for 8 weeks with lisinopril 20 mg in a randomized controlled trial. Endothelial function was assessed by measuring forearm blood flow responses to intra-arterial infusions of endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilators and an endothelium-dependent vasoconstrictor [acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, and monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) respectively] using venous occlusion plethysmography. Lisinopril significantly increased forearm blood flow response to acetylcholine by 20% [lisinopril, 3.12+/-0.37 (mean+/-SEM); placebo, 2.58+/-0.25; P=0.02, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 0.09, 1.06] (values given are ratios of flow in the infused arm relative to that in the control arm); no effect on response to sodium nitroprusside (lisinopril, 3.97+/-0.40; placebo, 3.92+/-0.39; P=0.84, 95% CI -0.50 , 0.61). The vasoconstrictor response to L-NMMA demonstrated a significant improvement (lisinopril, 0.77+/-0.06; placebo, 0.95+/-0.05; P<0.001, 95% CI: -0.09, -0.27). In conclusion, these results indicate that ACE inhibition can improve endothelial function in cigarette smokers. We show that lisinopril enhances both receptor-mediated and tonic NO release. The mechanism could be that lisinopril limits angiotensin II-induced superoxide radical production that would normally inactivate NO, or that lisinopril may increase bradykinin-mediated NO release.",0,0

PATIENTS The study population was 52% female and 16% African American with a mean age of 58 years. It included 5,446 patients who had essential hypertension (HTN) and 1,014 patients who had isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). These patients had untreated or uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 140 to 179 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 90 to 109 mm Hg inclusive at baseline) despite a variety of antihypertensive medications including diuretics , calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and alpha or beta blockers, alone or in combination. The mean initial blood pressure for the HT group was 156/97 mm Hg. Candesartan cilexetil as monotherapy (in 51% of patients with hypertension) reduced mean SBP/DBP by 18.7/13.1 mm Hg. As an add-on treatment (in 49% of patients with hypertension) to various background treatments, candesartan cilexetil consistently reduced mean SBP/DBP even more, regardless of background treatment: diuretics (17.8/11.3 mm Hg), calcium antagonists (16.6/11.2 mm Hg) Hg), beta-blockers (16.5/10.4 mm Hg), ACE inhibitors (15.3/10.0 mm Hg) , alpha blockers (16.4/10.4 mm Hg). The mean baseline blood pressure for the ISH group was 158/81 mm Hg. Candesartan cilexetil, as monotherapy (in 34% of ISH patients), reduced SBP/DBP by 17.0/4.4 mm Hg. As add-on therapy (in 66% of ISH patients) to various background therapies, candesartan cilexetil consistently lowered mean SBP/DBP even further, regardless of background therapy: diuretics (17.4/5.1 mm Hg), calcium antagonists (15.6/3.6 mm Hg).

691,11416681,Choice of initial antihypertensive drug therapy for the uncomplicated hypertensive patient.,,"Moore, M A","The choice of the initial antihypertensive drug for the uncomplicated hypertensive patient is an important and frequent event for the primary care physician. Patients' first experience with antihypertensive drug therapy will likely affect their long-term perception of hypertension treatment. The choice should be made on the basis of sound scientific data and from the perspective and needs of the patient. The drug should be taken once daily, should have proven efficacy in controlling hypertension and reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and should have as few side effects as possible. Low-dose thiazide diuretics fit this description, although the need to monitor electrolytes may make them less than ideal. The class of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, with side effects similar to those of placebo in controlled trials, is the most attractive from a patient's perspective, although there are as yet no outcome trial data showing that treatment of hypertension with angiotensin II receptor antagonists reduces cardiovascular events. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, with their low side effect profiles and unique effects on vascular remodeling, are attractive second choices to combine with a diuretic if necessary, although Low-dose diuretic/beta-blocker combinations have been recommended. It has been shown to lower blood pressure with minimal side effects. Ensuring adequate long-term control of hypertension is the most important aspect of hypertensive care today, and which antihypertensive drug(s) the physician chooses can greatly affect the ability of the hypertensive patient to achieve and maintain long-term blood pressure control.

We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial of 98 patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) to examine the efficacy of ACE inhibition with enalapril in preventing ultrasonographically measured carotid intima-media (IM) wall thickening.; Ninety-eight NIDDM patients were randomly assigned to enalapril 10 mg/d (n=48) or a control group (n=50); the intended duration of the trial was 2 years. All patients were seen at baseline (study entry) and 2 subsequent formal annual evaluations, in addition to standard clinical management for NIDDM. Intramuscular thickening and vascular lumen diameters were determined for all patients based on baseline and 2 subsequent yearly evaluations with carotid ultrasound. We performed an intention-to-treat analysis to assess changes in IM thickening throughout the study.; Annual measurements of IM thickening of the right and left common carotid arteries were 0.01+/-0.02 and 0.01+/-0.02 mm/year in the enalapril-treated group and 0.02+/- 0.03 and 0.02+/-0.02 mm/year in the group treated with enalapril. control group, respectively (P<0.05). From regression analysis, annual IM thickening was found to be predicted by enalapril use, gender, and insulin use (F(3.94)=3.86, P=0.012). When we controlled for these other variables, the use of enalapril reduced annual intramuscular thickening of the right and left common carotid arteries by 0.01 +/- 0.004 mm/year relative to the control group over the course of this study.; Long-term treatment with an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) slows progressive IM thickening of the common carotid artery in patients with NIDDM.",0,0

A modeling approach was used, which was based on a secondary analysis of published data, and the costs were those incurred by the SHI provider (ie SHI expenses). In the base case analysis, average case-related SHI expenditures were applied and PYCDA was quantified using the cumulative incidence of ESRF as observed in the REIN trial; The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of ramipril ranged from around -DM 76,700 to DM -81,900 per PYCDA (DM 1 is approximately US$0.55; 1999), according to treatment periods of 1 year and 3 years, respectively. In the sensitivity analysis, the robustness of the model and its results was demonstrated when the degree of influence of the different model variables on the base case results was investigated. First, the probabilities of ESRF and PYCDA were estimated according to the Weibull method. Second, the influence of the model variables on the target variable was quantified using a deterministic model. Third, the dependence of the target variable (ICER) on random variables was described in a simulation. The cost of chronic dialysis had by far the greatest impact on the target variable, which was 28 times greater than the impact of the clinical efficacy of ramipril, that is, the number of PYCDA. There were net savings per PYCDA with ramipril treatment after 1, 2, and 3 years: 95% of the 10,000 simulation steps resulted in savings of between 69,500 and 94,600 DM per PYCDA after 3 years; The results of this evaluation show that ramipril offers enormous savings from the perspective of the SHI (third party payer) provider in Germany when added to the conventional treatment of patients with nephropathy and non-diabetic hypertension.",0,0

Blood pressure and heart rate values were recorded in the office, in baseline conditions, after 1 and 6 months of treatment, and all patients underwent echocardiography, Holter electrocardiography, and stress testing. All drugs significantly lowered blood pressure, while left ventricular mass index was reduced with atenolol, enalapril, and SR-V, but not with HCTZ. Treatment induced a significant reduction in the number of patients with supraventricular arrhythmias (35 v 15, P < 0.034 and 28 v 8, excluding patients treated with HCTZ, P < 0.008). The number of patients with ventricular arrhythmias was also reduced (32 vs. 16 considering all groups, p < 0.08, and 24 vs. 9, excluding patients treated with HCTZ, p < 0.04).

Angiotensin II receptor blockers are a new therapeutic entity that have not been extensively studied in African-American hypertensives, either alone or in combination with other therapies such as diuretics or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We conducted a prospective, open-label, randomized pilot clinical trial to evaluate the effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan (160 mg once daily) on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive African Americans (n = 88) with a low level. salt (100 mEq Na+/day) for 2 weeks and the same diet supplemented with 100 mEq Na+ for 4 weeks.

Valsartan (160 mg/day) significantly reduced blood pressure in African-American patients on a low-salt (-6.4/-4.8 mm Hg: P < 0.001) and high-salt (-4.9/- 3.8 mm Hg: P = 0.001). 01). The high-salt diet slightly attenuated the antihypertensive effect (1.6/1.3 mm Hg, P = not significant).

Doubling the valsartan dose to 320 mg gradually reduced blood pressure by -3.8/-3.3 mm Hg (P = not significant). The least effective approach was adding benazepril 20 mg/day to valsartan 160 mg/day with no incremental reduction in systolic blood pressure and a reduction in diastolic blood pressure of only 1.7 mm Hg (p = not significant). We conclude that in our open-label pilot study, the antihypertensive activity of valsartan is not significantly attenuated by salt-supplemented diet in hypertensive African Americans. Furthermore, adding a low dose of HCTZ appears to be the most effective strategy for enhancing the antihypertensive activity of this angiotensin II receptor blocker in contrast to doubling the dose or adding an ACE inhibitor.",0,0

The discrepancy between the two drugs in responder-non-responder classification was expressed as the proportion of subjects whose PAA responded to only one of the drugs. Lisinopril was more effective than losartan in lowering BP (mean difference 4.7+/-8.1/3.3+/-5.7 mm Hg, systolic/diastolic, P < 0.05). Discrepancy in antihypertensive response between the two drugs was found in 39%/33% of subjects for systolic/diastolic ABP using arbitrary response criteria (33%/39% using median response criteria). Significant correlations were found between responses to lisinopril and losartan (r = 0.47/0.59, systolic/diastolic, p < 0.01). We conclude that in more than a third of hypertensive subjects, the BP response to ACE inhibition fails to predict the response to AT1R antagonism and vice versa. These data suggest that there are differences between these two classes of drugs that have not only theoretical but also practical significance.",0,0

Combination therapy aims to improve overall therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects. In well-designed multicenter clinical trials, perindopril/indapamide in doses ranging from 2/0.625 to 8/2.5 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving adequate blood pressure (BP) control. A similar reduction in supine BP was observed when the combination of perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day was compared with losartan 50 mg/day or atenolol 50 mg/day. Similar reductions in 24-hour ambulatory BP were also seen with perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day and irbesartan 150 mg/day. However, response and normalization rates were significantly higher with combination therapy than with losartan or irbesartan monotherapy. Combination therapy with perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day effectively lowered BP in elderly patients 65 to 85 years of age to a significantly greater extent than atenolol 50 mg/day or placebo. Supine BP also normalized in approximately two-thirds of patients in a small noncomparative trial in patients with hypertension and renal failure. Low dose perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day was well tolerated in clinical trials; the most common adverse events were headache and cough. Hypokalemia, associated with the use of diuretics, occurred at a higher incidence with perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day combination therapy than with atenolol 50 mg/day or placebo. Perindopril/Indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day has shown efficacy in well-designed comparative trials with atenolol, losartan and irbesartan, including elderly patients and patients with renal insufficiency. Studies comparing this dose of perindopril/indapamide with other combination therapies would be beneficial to allow the place of perindopril/indapamide to be determined more precisely.

However, it has been reported that these medications could induce chronic cough and airway hyperresponsiveness. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of bradykinin and tachykinins on citric acid-induced cough after pretreatment with ACE inhibitors in pigs. Cough was induced by challenging pigs with an aerosol of 0.8 M citric acid for 15 min. A trained observer counted the cough for 30 min. The animals underwent two cough induction tests two days apart (days 1 and 3), the first being taken as a control. All drugs were injected intravenously 30 min before the second challenge. In the control group, no difference was observed between days 1 and 3. The ACE inhibitor enalapril (7.5 and 15 microg/kg) caused cough frequency to increase significantly. In contrast, a dose-related decrease was observed with Hoe140 (icatibant), a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist (0.5 and 1 mg/kg). When both drugs were administered simultaneously (15 microg/kg of enalapril and 1 mg/kg of Hoe140), a significant increase was observed compared to the control value obtained on day 1. When enalapril was combined with the three antagonists of the tachykinin receptors RS 140333 (NK1 receptor antagonist), SR 48968 (NK2 receptor antagonist) and SR 142801 (NK3 receptor antagonist), a significant decrease was observed compared to the control value obtained on day 1; the percentage variation was also significantly different compared to that seen in the enalapril groups at both doses. These data suggest that the enhancement of the cough reflex induced by ACE inhibitors is mainly due to tachykinins and not bradykinin in our porcine model. However, bradykinin plays an important role in cough induced by citric acid alone.",0,0

There were negative correlations between the increase in the luminal area of the afferent arteriole and mean diastolic blood pressure in the study period in group 1 (P=0.024) and group 2 (P=0.032); Our results showed that a decrease in JGA size is compensated by antihypertensive drugs. The negative correlation between the change in the luminal area of the afferent arteriole and mean diastolic blood pressure in groups 1 and 2 suggests that renal protection in antihypertensive treatment may be through better constriction of the afferent arteriole protecting the glomerulus. of systemic blood pressure.",0,0

Six of these drugs have already been approved in Europe and the United States for the treatment of high blood pressure, and additional candidates are in the pipeline. The World Health Organization has also recently endorsed its use for this condition. Since AT1 receptor antagonists have been shown to be equal to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors with respect to antihypertensive efficacy, but have shown better safety profiles, this class of drugs can be considered a qualitative improvement in the treatment of hypertension. essential hypertension. Interestingly, the six agents now on the market diverge considerably with respect to their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, although it is unclear whether such differences are clinically relevant. A considerable number of large multicenter trials are underway to determine the possible long-term organoprotective effects of these substances on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Because of this, there has been considerable interest in the therapeutic potential of the natriuretic peptide system. Various approaches have been explored, including the use of native peptides, the development of natriuretic peptide mimetics, and the endogenous removal of natriuretic peptides. Although the administration of ANP and BNP may be of value in some circumstances, however, the limitations of the use of peptides, especially for long-term treatment, are evident. In view of this, considerable effort has been devoted to the development of oral active agents to potentiate endogenous natriuretic peptides through inhibition of degradation by neutral endopeptidase. This research has now led to vasopeptidase inhibitors, dual angiotensin and endopeptidase converting enzyme inhibitors. These agents clearly provide a novel approach to enhancing endogenous natriuretic peptide function in the setting of reduced angiotensin II activity and may lead to a major advance in the treatment of hypertension and conditions associated with overt salt and gas overload.

The present study examined whether such properties were particularly responsive to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Prospective, randomized, 12-week study in 138 previously treated hypertensive subjects, in 67 of whom the usual treatment (UC) was replaced by perindopril (P). The properties of the large arteries were assessed as an increase in central blood pressure determined by radial artery flattening tonometry and a transfer function. At baseline, both augmentation index (AI, %) and pressure (AP, mm Hg) were related to body size, heart rate, and gender. In addition, BP was related to age and systolic blood pressure (BP). After 12 weeks of treatment, BP decreased significantly in the perindopril and UC groups, while AI only decreased significantly (151.7%+/-2.3% to 144.9%+/-2.6% ) in those treated with perindopril. The decreases in AP (-4.2+/-0.9 mm Hg v -1.9+/-0.7 mm Hg) and AI (-6.8%+/-2.2% v -2.2%+/-2.5%) from week 0 to week 12 were higher in the perindopril-treated group, but the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.05 and 0.09, respectively).

735,11498653,Management of high-risk hypertensive patients with diabetes: potential role of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.,,"Weber, M A; Weir, M R","Uncontrolled hypertension leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Hypertensive patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes are at even higher risk of cardiovascular complications; furthermore, this high-risk patient population is at increased risk for kidney disease and ultimately kidney failure. Prospective morbidity and mortality trials have shown that tight blood pressure control improves cardiovascular prognosis and provides target organ protection. Current treatment guidelines recommend a target blood pressure of <130/85 mm Hg for patients with hypertension and diabetes. Angiotensin II (A-II), a major component of the renin-angiotensin system, plays an essential role in the pathophysiology of hypertension and diabetes-related kidney disease. Currently, the treatment of choice for hypertensive patients with diabetes is angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, but most data is limited to patients with type 1 diabetes. Although ACE inhibition is clearly a mechanism for block A-II formation, inhibition at this site may not be complete, as alternative pathways for A-II formation exist. Therefore, in disrupting the renin-angiotensin system, A-II receptor antagonists theoretically offer advantages over ACE inhibitors because they directly inhibit A-II by binding to the AT(1) receptor subtype. The objectives of this review are: 1) to provide an overview of the associated risk of cardiovascular complications with concomitant hypertension and diabetes; 2) demonstrate the cardiovascular benefits of effective blood pressure control in this patient population; 3) review current treatment guidelines for the management of high-risk hypertensive patients; and 4) review major ongoing clinical trials with A-II receptor antagonists in patients with concomitant hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and kidney disease.

An interim AASK analysis at 3 years revealed a renoprotective effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril compared with the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (DHP-CCB) amlodipine in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. This differential effect was independent of the blood pressure (BP) levels achieved and was evident in proteinuric patients and suggestive in patients with baseline proteinuria <300 mg/d, but it was not conclusive. Data from the AASK trial suggest that DHP-CCBs should be used with caution in the presence of mild to moderate renal impairment. Judgment should be reserved for the use of other CCBs, such as verapamil or diltiazem, as these are fundamentally different CCBs with the potential for a different impact on hypertensive nephrosclerosis.

ACEIs increase the generation of NO, a proinflammatory substance in bronchial epithelial cells. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we tested the hypothesis that supplementation with iron, an NO synthase inhibitor, may reduce cough associated with ACEI use. Subjects were 19 patients who had developed ACEI-induced cough. After a 2-week observation period, they were randomized to a daily morning dose of 256 mg ferrous sulfate in tablet form or placebo for a 4-week treatment period. Subjects were asked to complete a cough diary rating daily cough severity on a scale of 0 to 4. Mean daily cough scores during the last week of the observation and treatment period were compared. Changes in blood cell count and serum iron and ferritin concentration between the 2 periods were evaluated. Mean daily cough scores during the observation and treatment periods were 3.07+/-0.70 and 1.69+/-1.10, respectively, for the iron group and 2.57+/-0, 80 and 2.35+/-1.22, respectively, for the placebo group, showing a significant reduction in cough scores with iron supplementation (P<0.01) but not with placebo.

Thirty-day mortality in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, and Latin America was 6.7%, 7.3%, 5.7%, 10.1%, P<0.0001. Adjusted mortality for Europe was intermediate between North America and Latin America (odds ratios [OR] [95% confidence intervals (CI)] compared to Western Europe: North America 0.84 [0.67-1, 0], Eastern Europe 1.2 [1.0-1.4], and Latin America 1.8 [1.3-2.7]). Revascularization rates varied 10-fold but did not explain regional differences in mortality. Germany and the United Kingdom had similar adjusted mortality at 1 year (OR for the United Kingdom 1.16 [0.92-1.5]), although invasive procedures were four to ten times more common in Germany. Similarly, the US and Canada had the same 1-year adjusted mortality (OR for Canada 0.85 [0.61-1.17]) despite three times the use of invasive procedures in the US. ; Significant geographic variations in practice and adjusted mortality after fibrinolysis persist despite recent guidelines. These findings have important implications for the design and interpretation of international studies, identify underused and overused therapies, and support further study of treatments with marked variations around the world.",0,0
747,11515986,Diabetics with uncontrolled hypertension with ACE inhibitors: alternative therapies.,,"Cleophas, T J; van Ouwerkerk, B M; van der Meulen, J; Zwinderman, A H","If hypertension in patients with type II diabetes mellitus is not adequately controlled with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-i) inhibitors, a beta-blocker is often added as second-line therapy. Recently, large randomized trials demonstrated the beneficial effect of second-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in these patients. These compounds are increasingly being used to replace beta blockers. Withdrawal of beta-blockers may influence diabetes control and may cause rebound hypertension. Rebound hypertension from beta-blocker withdrawal may not occur if the beta-blocker is replaced with a calcium channel blocker. A calcium channel blocker will influence vascular resistance (VR) and blood pressure differently than a beta blocker. Thirty-four patients with type II diabetes mellitus and resting diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg despite enalapril 10 mg daily (or equipotent doses of other ACE-i) for at least 3 months were treated in a sequential comparison. open-label with the same ACE-i in combination with the beta-blocker metoprolol 100 mg for 3 months and then for an additional 3 months with the same ACE-i in combination with the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker lercanidipine 10 mg once daily day. After 6 weeks, patients with a diastolic blood pressure above 90 mm Hg were titrated to metoprolol 200 mg or lercanidipine 20 mg once daily. Patients were examined every 6 weeks during the trial and after 2 weeks while receiving lercanidipine. In addition to blood pressure measurements, RV was measured by iridium strain gauge plethysmography and expressed in units (1 unit = 1 mm Hg/mL blood/100 mL tissue per minute). Two of 34 patients did not complete the protocol due to noncompliance with lercanidipine treatment in the first 2 weeks of treatment. Your data is included in the analysis. No rebound hypertension was observed 14 days after changing therapies. (Mean arterial pressures [MAP] were not significantly different from the point of beta-blocker withdrawal.) However, heart rate increased from 69+/-7 to 94+/-10 beats/min (p < 0.001). After 3 months on lercanidipine, MAP was reduced by 6+/-10 mm Hg (p = 0.002) compared to the beta-blocker withdrawal point. Vascular resistance decreased 6.28+/-11.91 units (p<0.01), while glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) increased 0.4+/-0.5% (p<0.001) and body weight increased 0.6+/-0.6 kg (p < 0.01). Multiple regression analysis revealed significant associations between decreased VR, increased HbAlc, and decreased MAP, and partial dependence of these variables on each other. In hypertensive patients with type II diabetes, substitution of ACE-i and metoprolol for ACE-i and lercanidipine does not appreciably influence metabolic control and does not cause rebound hypertension. Lercanidipine was more effective than metoprolol as a second-line antihypertensive drug in these patients. At least two mechanisms may be involved: withdrawal of the pressor effect of the beta-blocker and vasodilation mediated by calcium channels.",0,0

Two control groups of 10 patients each were used. Control group 1 with normal kidney function, and control group 2 with normokalaemia and kidney failure of the same magnitude as that of hyperkalemic patients. Serum osmolarity, electrolytes, creatinine, aldosterone, and electrolytes and urine osmolarity were measured and TTKG calculated; IHL patients had lower TTKG values than control 1 patients (2.58 +/- 0.36 vs. 6.68 +/- 0.55, p < 0.001), and also lower than control 2 patients (2.58 +/- 0.36 vs. 5.51 +/- 0.87, p < 0.01).

The beneficial effect in slowing the progression of kidney disease is greater in patients with higher urinary protein excretion at the start of treatment. We hypothesize that the greater beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on the progression of kidney disease in patients with higher baseline levels of proteinuria is due to their greater antiproteinuric effect in these patients; We analyzed data from 1,860 patients enrolled in 11 randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of antihypertensive regimens, including ACE inhibitors, with regimens that did not include ACE inhibitors on the progression of non-diabetic kidney disease. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between the level of proteinuria at baseline and changes in urinary protein excretion during follow-up. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess the relationship between changes in urinary protein excretion during follow-up and the effect of ACE inhibitors on time to doubling of baseline serum creatinine values or the onset of end-stage kidney disease; Initial mean (median) urinary protein excretion was 1.8 (0.94) g/day. Patients with higher baseline values of urinary protein excretion had a greater reduction in proteinuria during follow-up in association with ACE inhibitor treatment and in association with reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (P interaction < 0.001 for all). A higher level of urinary protein excretion during follow-up (baseline minus change) was associated with an increased risk of progression [relative risk 5.56 (3.87 to 7.98) for every 1.0 g/day of increased protein excretion]. After controlling for the current level of urinary protein excretion, the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors remained significant [the relative risk of ACE inhibitors versus control was 0.66 (0.52 to 0 .83)], but there was no significant interaction between the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors and baseline level of urinary protein excretion; The antiproteinuric effects of ACE inhibitors and blood pressure lowering are greater in patients with higher initial urinary protein excretion. The greater beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on the progression of kidney disease in patients with higher baseline proteinuria can be explained by their greater antiproteinuric effects in these patients. The current level of urinary protein excretion is a modifiable risk factor for the progression of non-diabetic kidney disease. ACE inhibitors provide a greater beneficial effect at all levels of current urinary protein excretion.",0,0

Its in vivo and in vitro degradation by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) explains the high plasma concentrations of AcSDKP in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. Because ACE inhibitors can induce anemia in some patients, we measured plasma concentrations of AcSDKP in 176 patients with chronic kidney failure: 120 patients on hemodialysis (HD) and 56 patients without dialysis (nD), 39 of whom ACE inhibitors were administered. We studied the relationships between AcSDKP levels, hematological parameters, and recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) requirements in these patients. AcSDKP levels were significantly higher in HD (10.3 +/- 3.9 pmol/mL) and nD (3.1 +/- 1.8 pmol/mL) patients who did not receive ACE inhibitors than in controls (1.8 +/- 0.2 pmol/mL). In all patients, treatment with ACE inhibitors significantly increased these levels fourfold. HD sessions significantly reduced AcSDKP concentrations by 66% and reduced the in vitro predialysis half-life of AcSDKP (270 +/- 109 minutes) to values (182 +/- 67 minutes) not significantly different from controls or nD patients. Most HD patients treated with ACE inhibitors had AcSDKP levels greater than 24 pmol/mL (the highest concentration found in other ND and HD patients). Only in this group of patients did the weekly doses of rHuEPO correlate with AcSDKP levels. Our results show that renal function is essential to maintain stable plasma levels of AcSDKP and, at high levels, AcSDKP acts as a uremic toxin causing partial resistance to erythropoietin and inhibiting erythropoiesis.",0,0

Among hospitalized patients, the incidence of these reactions ranges from 1 to 3%. The frequency of skin reactions to specific drugs can exceed 10%. These reactions can range from mild discomfort to life-threatening. Anti-infective and anticonvulsant agents are among the drugs most commonly associated with adverse skin reactions. We describe and illustrate the clinical morphology of the most common cutaneous drug reactions, as well as the drugs that most commonly precipitate specific reactions. The varied nature of the reactions that occur, even with specific agents, indicates a multiplicity of available mechanisms by which cutaneous drug reactions can be initiated. Although a variety of terms have been proposed to categorize cutaneous drug reactions, we propose that reactions be best defined based on mechanisms, when known. In this review, we assess current knowledge of four categories of cutaneous drug reactions: immediate-type immune-mediated reactions, delayed-type immune-mediated reactions, photosensitivity reactions, and autoimmune syndromes. In addition, we describe the evidence that viral infection is an important predisposing factor for the development of skin drug reactions following drug administration.

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase, is synthesized by many cell types, including vascular endothelial cells. The serum level of ADMA is elevated in patients with essential hypertension, but the mechanism of this increase is unknown. Therefore, the present study examined whether the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved. Patients with essential hypertension [systolic blood pressure (BP) > 160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP > 95 mmHg] were randomized to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment group (perindopril, 4 mg/day for 4 weeks, n = 7), an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist treatment group (losartan, 50 mg/day for 4 weeks, n = 7), or a beta-blocker treatment group (bisoprolol , 5 mg/day for 4 weeks, n = 7). Before and after treatment, BP, serum ADMA concentration, and plasma concentration of von Willebrand factor (vWF, a biological marker of endothelial damage) were measured. Perindopril, losartan, and bisoprolol lowered BP to a similar degree, and perindopril or losartan, but not bisoprolol, significantly lowered serum ADMA and plasma vWF. These findings suggest that the RAS may contribute to the mechanism of increased serum ADMA as well as the endothelial injury seen in hypertensive patients. The vasculoprotective actions of ACE inhibitors or AT1 receptor antagonists may be explained, at least in part, by amelioration of endothelial injury through a decrease in serum ADMA concentration.",0,0

763,11570665,Administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be monitored for serum amylase and lipase to prevent acute pancreatitis: a case report.,,"Borgia, M C; Celestini, A; Caravella, P; Catalano, C","Some clinical cases published in the literature show that the administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) can cause acute pancreatitis. In this work, the authors report a case of a patient affected by hypertension. On admission, the authors started antihypertensive therapy with captopril, which caused a significant increase in amylase and lipase in 13 days. When ACE inhibitor therapy was stopped, a rapid decline in serum enzyme was observed within 3 days. High serum amylase and lipase levels were related to neutrophilia but were not associated with relevant symptomatic findings or features of pancreatopathy. The absence of the usual conditions that can cause pancreatitis, such as bile stasis, hypercalcemia, or alcohol abuse, and the rapid decline in serum enzyme levels after drug discontinuation suggested ACE inhibitor-induced pancreatitis. This is the first clinical report of ACE inhibitor-induced pancreatitis in which captopril administration was found after hospitalization. The suspension of the drug probably prevented other complications. This case report suggests that when ACE inhibitors are started, serum amylase and lipase should be monitored to prevent acute pancreatitis without waiting for clinical evidence of pancreatopathy.",0,0

All 4 antihypertensives were equally effective in controlling BP over 24 hours, as evidenced by 24-hour PAA measurements. The incidence of adverse events was similar for the 4 treatment groups; headache was the most common event, being reported by 22 patients (20%). There was a clinically relevant reduction in total cholesterol for the doxazosin (-15.4 mg/dl) and amlodipine (-11.6 mg/dl) treatment groups compared to enalapril and bendrofluazide. Our results of ABP measurements suggest that the antihypertensives studied are an effective first-line therapy in the regulation of hypertension and that ABP is a reproducible measure. PAA may also be useful in identifying patients with various types of high BP, for example those with ""white coat"" hypertension, allowing for more accurate detection and diagnosis.",0,0

We conducted this study to assess the potential benefit of implementing a CHF disease management program in a tertiary care center, particularly in terms of beta-blocker use and cost to the health care system.; After reviewing the literature on therapies and management strategies for patients with CHF, we developed the Duke Heart Failure Program. All enrolled patients had 1 of the following: recent CHF hospitalization, ejection fraction less than 20%, or symptoms consistent with New York Heart Association class III or IV. We compare drug use and resource utilization before and after enrollment; We enrolled 117 patients between July 1998 and April 1999. The median time to enrollment was 4.7 months. Beta-blocker use and dose were significantly increased (52% vs. 76% for beta-blockers, p < 0.01; 6% vs. 13% for target dose, p < 0.01). The hospitalization rate decreased (1.5 vs. 0 hospitalizations per patient-year, p < 0.01), while the number of clinic visits increased (4.3 vs. 9.8 clinic visits per patient -year, p < 0.01). Duke University Health System saved an average of $8,571 per patient-year; Implementation of a CHF disease management program was associated with better CHF drug dosing and decreased hospitalization for CHF patients. A CHF disease management program is an effective method for a health care system to care for patients with CHF.",0,0

ECGs were recorded at the beginning and end of the study. We compared the prevention/regression and the development/persistence of ECG-LVH in the two groups and related these changes to the results. At baseline, 676 patients had LVH (321 in the ramipril group and 355 in the placebo group) and 7605 patients did not have LVH (3814 in the ramipril group and 3791 in the placebo group).

Enalapril was administered orally as a new extemporaneous suspension in children less than 6 years of age and as tablets in older children. First-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics were estimated in children 1 to 24 months, 25 months to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 16 years. Peak serum concentrations of enalapril occurred approximately 1 hour after administration. Serum concentrations of enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril, peaked 4 to 6 hours after the first dose and 3 to 4 hours after multiple doses. The area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC), adjusted for body surface area, did not differ between age groups. Based on comparison of first-dose and steady-state AUCs, enalaprilat accumulation in children ranged from 1.13- to 1.45-fold. For children 2 to 15 years of age, the mean urinary recovery of total enalaprilat ranged from 58.3% in children 6 to < 12 years of age to 71.4% in children 12 to < 16 years of age.

Carotid parameters were determined by recording instantaneous pressure (applanation tonometry) and diameter (echo tracking device) and modeling the pressure-diameter loop to obtain Peterson's modulus, stiffness index, measured and isobaric adaptations and the wall viscosity. Drug effects on carotid parameters did not differ, except for systolic and diastolic diameters (p < 0.01), which were negligibly increased with nitrendipine but decreased (p < 0.01) with trandolapril. Blood cholesterol status did not influence the carotid effects of trandolapril, while nitrendipine-treated patients with low and high cholesterol showed significant differences in the effects of the drug on (a) systolic and pulse pressure (p < 0, 05), which decreased in patients with low cholesterol (p < 0.01, p < 0.05) but not in those with high cholesterol; (b) diastolic diameter (p = 0.05), which increased negligibly in patients with low cholesterol but did not change in those with high cholesterol; and (c) wall viscosity (p < 0.01), which decreased in patients with low cholesterol (p < 0.05) but increased negligibly in those with high cholesterol. In addition, the change in wall viscosity with nitrendipine was positively related to baseline blood cholesterol (r = 0.64, p < 0.01).

The Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke (PROGRESS) study was designed to determine the effects of a blood pressure-lowering regimen in hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack.; 6,105 people from 172 centers in Asia, Australasia, and Europe were randomly assigned active treatment (n=3,051) or placebo (n=3,054). Active treatment consisted of a flexible regimen based on the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (4 mg daily), with the addition of the diuretic indapamide at the discretion of the treating physicians. The primary outcome was total stroke (fatal or non-fatal). Analysis was by intention to treat.; During 4 years of follow-up, active treatment reduced blood pressure by 9/4 mm Hg. 307 (10%) individuals assigned to active treatment experienced a stroke, compared with 420 (14%) assigned to placebo (relative risk reduction 28% [95% CI 17-38], p<0.0001).

Medications to lower uric acid were discontinued 3 weeks before the start of the study. Patients were randomized to receive either losartan 50 mg or irbesartan 150 mg once daily for 4 weeks. During this phase, a placebo was administered at night. After 4 weeks, the dose was increased to losartan 50 mg twice daily or irbesartan 150 mg twice daily for another 4-week period. Subsequently, the patients were switched to the alternative treatment modality. Enalapril (20 mg once daily) was administered during the baseline period and between the two treatment phases. Serum and urinary uric acid were measured at the beginning and at the end of each treatment phase; Our results show that losartan 50 mg once daily decreased serum uric acid levels from 538 +/- 26 to 491 +/- 20 micromol/L (P < 0.01). Irbesartan had no effect on serum uric acid. Increasing the losartan dose from 50 mg once daily to 50 mg twice daily did not further lower serum uric acid. This may be due in part to poor compliance with the evening dose measured with an electronic device. In fact, whatever the drug prescribed, the mean adherence to the evening dose was always significantly lower than that to the morning dose. The uricosuric effect of losartan appears to decrease over time when a new, lower serum uric acid steady state is reached; In contrast to irbesartan, losartan was uricosuric and lowered serum uric acid levels. Losartan 50 mg twice daily did not produce a greater drop in serum uric acid than losartan once daily.

However, during follow-up, patients receiving ACE inhibitors showed 4-6 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure values; In patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension due to primary renal disease, fosinopril differed significantly from nifedipine GITS in its ability to slow the progressive deterioration of renal function. The drugs also differed in their ability to lower blood pressure. The better control, in particular of systolic blood pressure, in the fosinopril arm could have contributed significantly to the achievement of a better result when the ACEI was used.",0,0

There were 278 patients who were eligible to enter the study. They were randomized to receive captopril or placebo 25 to 50 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. The change in quality of life was compared both quantitatively and qualitatively between the captopril and placebo groups. Changes in blood pressure and side effects were also compared; With intention-to-treat analysis, qualitatively more patients with better quality of life could be found in patients treated with captopril (45.3% vs. 23.7%, P = 0.0002 for the physical health domain; 48 .9% vs. 26.6%, P = .0002 for the mental health domain) ; 33.8% vs. 11.5%, P = 0.0001 for the general function domain). Quantitatively, change in mental health score, general function and total quality of life for captopril (3.18 +/- 5.90, 1.65 +/- 4.43, 7.84 +/- 11.03) was significantly greater than placebo (1.32 +/- 5.13, P = 0.00004, 0.64 +/- 3.45, P = 0.0008, 4.19 +/- 10.33, P = 0.0025 respectively), and the change in physical health domain score (3.01 +/- 5.26 vs 2.23 +/- 4.79, P = 0.044) was borderline statistically significant.

These findings will have an impact on how ramipril is used in primary care, where ACE inhibitors are not currently prescribed appropriately. Patients who meet the HOPE study inclusion criteria should be considered as suitable candidates for long-term ramipril therapy as an adjunct to their existing drug regimen. Screening should include monitoring of renal function (by serum creatinine), particularly within the first two weeks of treatment, in addition to regular monitoring of serum potassium. However, the HOPE study shows that ramipril is well tolerated at high doses and over a long period of treatment. The efficacy of therapy should also be reviewed periodically and the dose adjusted when necessary. If concern persists, referral to a specialist (cardiologist or diabetologist) may be necessary.",0,0

Forty-eight hypertensives participated in an experiment at home and in the doctor's office. Participants were randomized to an experimental group with assignment of pet ownership plus lisinopril (20 mg/d) or a control group with lisinopril alone (20 mg/d). On each study day, blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma renin activity were recorded at baseline and after each mental stressor (serial subtraction and speech). Before drug therapy, mean responses to mental stress did not differ significantly between the experimental and control groups in heart rate (94 [SD 6.8] vs 93 [6.8] bpm), systolic blood pressure (182 [8.0] vs. 181 [8.3] mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (120 [6.6] vs. 119 [7.9] mm Hg), or plasma renin activity (9.4 [ 0.59] vs. 9.3 [0.57] ng.mL(-1).h(-1)).

Therapeutic trials based on cardiovascular mortality have recently shown that SBP reduction requires normalization of both the stiffness of the large arteries and the wave reflections. The aim of the present study was to compare the antihypertensive effects of the very low-dose combination of indapamide (0.625 mg) and perindopril (2 mg) (Per/Ind) with the beta-blocking agent atenolol (50 mg) to determine whether Per/Ind decreases SBP and pulse pressure (PP) more than atenolol and, if so, whether this decrease is primarily due to reduction in aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) (automated measurements) and reduction in wave reflexes (pulse wave analysis, applanation tonometry). In a double-blind randomized study, 471 patients with essential hypertension were followed up for 12 months. For the same DBP reduction, Per/Ind decreased brachial SBP (-6.02 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -8.90 to -3.14) and PP (-5.57; 95% confidence interval). 95% confidence, -7.70 to -3.44) significantly more than atenolol. This difference was significantly more pronounced for the carotid artery than for the brachial artery. While the 2 antihypertensive agents reduced PWV to a similar degree, only Per/Ind significantly attenuated carotid wave reflexes, resulting in selective lowering of SBP and PP.

However, little is known about the comparative effects of various classes of antihypertensive agents on pulse pressure. In retrospective analyzes of the Veterans Affairs Single-Agent Hypertension Study, we compared changes in pulse pressure with 6 classes of antihypertensive agents: 1292 men with diastolic blood pressure 95 to 109 mm Hg who received placebo were randomized to receive hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, prazosin, or placebo. Drug doses were adjusted to achieve a target diastolic blood pressure of <90 mm Hg during a 4- to 8-week medication titration phase. Change in pulse pressure (subtracted placebo) from baseline to end of 3-month titration and 1-year maintenance was assessed. Mean baseline systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures were 152, 99, and 53 mm Hg, respectively. Reductions in pulse pressure during titration were greater (P<0.001) with clonidine (6.7 mm Hg) and hydrochlorothiazide (6.2 mm Hg) than with captopril (2.5 mm Hg), diltiazem (1, 6 mm Hg) and atenolol (1.4 mm Hg); the reduction with prazosin (3.9 mm Hg) was similar to that of all except clonidine. After 1 year, pulse pressure decreased significantly more (P<0.001) with hydrochlorothiazide (8.6 mm Hg) than with captopril and atenolol (4.1 mm Hg with both); clonidine (6.3 mm Hg), diltiazem (5.5 mm Hg), and prazosin (5.0 mm Hg) were intermediates.

Preliminary evidence suggests that a decrease in blood pressure (BP) is associated with a decrease in wall thickness. It is not known whether all classes of antihypertensive agents have similar protective effects. In this double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial, 69 previously untreated patients with hypertension were randomly assigned to 1 year of treatment with amlodipine (5-10 mg daily) or lisinopril (5-20 mg daily). Doxazosin and bendrofluazide were added if necessary to achieve BP control. After 12 months of treatment, clinical BP, ambulatory BP, and cardiac mass were reduced similarly with the two treatment regimens. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness decreased by 0.048 mm (95% confidence intervals: -0.066, -0.031 mm) in the amlodipine-treated group, but decreased by only 0.027 mm (-0.046, -0.007 mm) in the group treated with lisinopril (P<0.05 for difference between treatments). Common carotid artery lumen diameter was significantly decreased only in patients treated with lisinopril [amlodipine, -0.02 mm (-0.14, 0.10 mm); lisinopril, -0.21mm (-0.32, -0.11mm); P<0.02], while the intima-media area decreased similarly in the two treatment groups [amlodipine -1.32 mm(2) (-1.91, -0.74 mm(2)), lisinopril -1.26 mm(2) (-1.80, -0.72 mm(2)); insignificant]. The results confirm that a decrease in BP causes regression of structural changes in the carotid artery in hypertensive patients. The nature of structural regression differed markedly between the two treatment regimens, despite similar decreases in BP. Calcium channel blocker induced greater regression of common carotid artery intima-media thickness than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. However, carotid artery wall mass, as indicated by the intima-media area, was reduced to a similar degree with the two treatments.

The remaining patients were randomized to the combination of valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide or valsartan-benazepril; The two combinations induced a further significant reduction in BP, which was of similar magnitude for diastolic BP (-4.5 during valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide treatment and -3.3 mmHg during valsartan-benazepril treatment), but greater magnitude for systolic BP during treatment with valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide (-6.77 mmHg) than during coadministration of valsartan-benazepril (-3.2 mmHg). At the end of the trial, the BP of those who responded to valsartan monotherapy was lower than that of patients who required combination therapy. Valsartan administered alone or associated with hydrochlorothiazide or benazepril was well tolerated; Thus, these data show that in patients who do not respond sufficiently to angiotensin II receptor blockade, BP can be further safely lowered by adding a small dose of a diuretic or an ACE inhibitor, and the combination containing the diuretic tends to be more effective in controlling systolic BP. .",0,0

We correlated the odd ratios of the trials for differences in systolic pressure between groups.; We analyzed nine randomized trials comparing treatments in 62,605 hypertensive patients. Compared with older medications (diuretics and beta-blockers), calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors offered similar overall cardiovascular protection, but calcium channel blockers provided greater risk reduction of stroke (13.5%, 95% CI: 1.3-24.2, p=0.03) and lower risk reduction of myocardial infarction (19.2%, 3.5-37.3 , p=0.01). Heterogeneity was significant between trials due to high risk of cardiovascular events with doxazosin in one trial and high risk of stroke with captopril in another; but systolic pressure differed between groups in these two trials by 2-3 mm Hg. Similar systolic differences occurred in one trial of diltiazem versus older drugs, and in three trials of converting enzyme inhibitor versus placebo in high-risk patients. Meta-regression on 27 trials (136,124 patients) showed that odds ratios could be explained by differences achieved in systolic pressure.; Our findings emphasize that blood pressure control is important.

After a 2-week single-blind placebo trial, patients were randomized to receive NI 30 mg or AM 5 mg. Responders continued on the same dose for an additional 16 weeks, while nonresponders were titrated to 60 mg NI or 10 mg AM; Blood pressure was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer and the equivalence of efficacy of NI and AM was tested by analysis of covariance. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the main efficacy parameter, its baseline value was taken as a covariate, while the effect of centers and treatment interaction were included as fixed effects in the analysis model. Secondary efficacy variables systolic blood pressure (SBP) and QOL scores were analyzed according to the same model; At the end of the study, the overall mean DBP, calculated as least squares means (LSMEANS), in the ""per protocol"" population was 87.5 mmHg for NI and 86.7 for AM (difference 0.8 mmHg with CI 90%: -1.2 to 2.8 mmHg).

They increase the availability of peptides that have vasodilatory and other vascular effects; they also inhibit the production of angiotensin II. In animal models, vasopeptidase inhibitors lower blood pressure in low-, medium-, and high-renin forms of hypertension, and also appear to confer benefit in models of heart failure and ischemic heart disease. Studies in human hypertension show that these agents are effective in lowering blood pressure regardless of race or age. Experience with omapatrilat, the most clinically advanced of these drugs, has shown that it is more effective than currently available ACE inhibitors or other widely used antihypertensive agents. Studies with omapatrilat in congestive heart failure have shown beneficial effects on hemodynamics and symptoms. Vasopeptidase inhibitors appear to have similar safety profiles to ACE inhibitors, although the frequency of side effects such as angioedema and cough remains to be established. Large clinical endpoint trials, some already underway, are needed to establish the place of this drug class alongside established therapies in conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and kidney disease.",0,0

Treatment is usually started with a low dose of a single agent and adjusted to a higher dose as needed. Up to 50% of patients require the addition of a second agent to achieve satisfactory blood pressure control. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dose-response relationship of nitrendipine and enalapril alone or in fixed combination in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. A total of 496 patients were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, factorial-design, parallel-group clinical trial comparing placebo, nitrendipine (5, 10, and 20 mg), and enalapril (5, 10, and 20 mg) alone or in combination. After a 2-week single-blind placebo trial period, 414 patients whose diastolic blood pressure ranged from 90 to 109 mm Hg were randomly assigned to a treatment group. The combination of nitrendipine and enalapril, particularly regimens that included 20 mg nitrendipine and 5 or 10 mg enalapril, were significantly superior to both monotherapies; mean reductions in diastolic blood pressure from baseline to last visit were -12.5 and -14.3 mm Hg, respectively. Response surface analysis provided additional evidence that these combinations were optimal in terms of antihypertensive efficacy. All treatments were well tolerated and the incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between groups. In summary, the antihypertensive efficacy of the combination was found to be superior to both monotherapies at any dose.

Because it appears that chronic renal failure and proteinuria may well be cardiovascular risk factors, it is interesting to note that recent large-scale epidemiological studies (Heart Outcomes and Prevention Evaluation [HOPE]) have demonstrated both cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of inhibition. of the ACE. It seems paradoxical that such renoprotective effects are clearly evident in diabetes mellitus in which plasma renin activity may be suppressed. Even in this setting, there appears to be activation of the renal angiotensin system(s), and inhibitions of these intrarenal systems are involved in the renoprotective effects of these agents. Recent studies have identified almost all the components required to generate angiotensin II in the renal luminal compartment and suggest that there may be a direct effect through AT(1) receptors on NaCl transport in the distal nephron. The possibility that components of this intraluminal renin-angiotensin system may be acutely regulated by variations in dietary salt intake provides an opportunity to better understand the normal maintenance of salt balance. Whether or not inhibition of these pathways is involved in the renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists is an important issue that needs to be addressed.",0,0

We included 18 of 333 adverse drug reaction studies and 22 of 61 variant allele review articles.; Articles were reviewed and coded by all investigators using standardized abstract forms; We identified 27 medications frequently cited in studies of adverse drug reactions. Among these drugs, 59% are metabolized by at least 1 enzyme with a variant allele known to cause poor metabolism. In contrast, only 7% to 22% of randomly selected drugs are known to be metabolized by enzymes with this genetic variability (range, P = 0.006-P < 0.001); Our results suggest that drug therapy based on the genetic makeup of individuals may result in a clinically important reduction in adverse outcomes.

In a double-blind study, 34 patients with essential hypertension were treated for 3 months with ramipril 2.5-5.0 mg daily (n = 17, age 57 +/- 7 years, 11 men) or atenolol 50-100 mg. per day (n = 17, age 53 +/- 8 years, 11 men). Blood pressure (BP), brachial artery diameter (D), brachial-radial pulse wave velocity (PWV), and effective compliance (Ceff), were measured before and at the end of the study. The isobaric evaluation (Ciso) was performed in the entire population studied at an average mean BP of 110 mmHg. Ramipril significantly reduced BP from 155 +/- 16/94 +/- 6 mmHg to 140 +/- 15/85 +/- 7 mmHg (p < 0.001) without affecting heart rate (HR; 74 +/- 10 vs. .75 +/- 12 bpm). In addition, it significantly improved both PWV (18%; p < 0.001) and arterial compliance (45%; p < 0.001), of which 35% were associated with a pressure-independent effect (p < 0.01) . Atenolol also induced a reduction in both BP (159 +/- 17/96 +/- 10 to 133 +/- 13/81 +/- 8 mmHg; p < 0.001) and HR (76 +/- 10 a 57 +/- 7 bpm, p < 0.001). Similarly, PWV (11%; p < 0.05) and Ceff (30%; p < 0.05) were significantly improved with no significant change in Ciso. This suggests that the reduction in blood pressure was responsible for the improvement in compliance. In conclusion, it is suggested that atenolol induces only hemodynamic changes, mainly mediated by BP reduction. In contrast, the improved brachial shock-absorbing function observed after ramipril involves not only hemodynamic changes, but also changes mediated by other mechanisms, such as modification of wall structures.",0,0

Achieving such target pressures is increasingly difficult, particularly in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease, who require complex multidrug antihypertensive regimens. This review attempts to provide some suggestions for the construction of such antihypertensive regimens and provides considerations for the appropriate use of diuretics and the most effective drug combinations.

ASA may antagonize some effects of ACEi therapy by inhibiting the synthesis of vasodilator prostaglandins; however, the evidence for this effect from large controlled trials is conflicting. The authors analyzed a database of 18,895 patients from the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardio-3 (GISSI-3) Trial in which patients were assigned to receive lisinopril or not to receive lisinopril within 24 hours. after the onset of the disease. symptoms of myocardial infarction. The objective of the study was to verify the possible negative interaction between ASA and the ACEI lisinopril in the post-acute phase of acute myocardial infarction. Of 18,895 analysable patients, 15,841 received ASA at admission. Overall, lisinopril reduced 42-day mortality from 7.1% to 6.3%. In patients who received ASA, mortality was reduced with lisinopril from 6.0% to 5.4%, and from 13.0% to 10.8% in patients who did not receive ASA. The difference in the proportional reductions in mortality corresponds to the fact that a more marked effect of lisinopril is observed in patients with higher baseline risk in all subgroups of the study, one of which coincides with the group without ASA. Analysis of the in-hospital incidence of major clinical events did not reveal a potentially negative interaction between ASA and lisinopril. The same findings were obtained from the analysis of reinfarction at 42 days. The interaction between ASA and lisinopril was also tested by multivariate analysis adjusted for confounding variables at admission, and the interaction tests were not statistically significant. Serum creatinine levels at 42 days were significantly higher in the lisinopril group than in the control group. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the lisinopril group were significantly lower than controls at 42 days. The effect of lisinopril on creatinine and blood pressure did not differ between the ASA and non-ASA groups. ASA does not decrease the mortality benefit of lisinopril early after myocardial infarction, nor does it increase the risk of major adverse events. Lisinopril is safe and effective when administered shortly after the onset of myocardial infarction, regardless of whether concomitant ASA administration is started early and continued for a period of 6 weeks.",0,0

The purpose of the ABC trial was to address previous reports suggesting that drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may not be effective in controlling BP in hypertensive black people. Patients were randomized to receive candesartan cilexetil 16 mg (n = 156) or placebo (n = 148) once daily after a 4- to 5-week single-blind placebo run-in period.

Clinical results, reported in the companion article, found that candesartan cilexetil started at 16 mg once daily and increased to 32 mg once daily as needed, with subsequent addition of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg as needed. , was effective in lowering diastolic and systolic blood pressure and was well tolerated based on office interviews. Analyzes of patients' perceptions of tolerability found that HRQoL was maintained over the 12-week study period, with no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups at the end of double-blind treatment. These results indicate that HRQoL in black patients with systemic hypertension is maintained during treatment with candesartan cilexetil.",0,0

Efficacy of ramipril in nephropathy.,,"Ruggenenti, P; Perna, A; Remuzzi, G","In this post hoc secondary analysis of the Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) trial, a risk/benefit profile of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition was evaluated in 322 patients with non-diabetic chronic proteinuric kidney disease and varying degrees of renal failure. . The rate of decline in GFR (Delta GFR) and the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during treatment with ramipril or ACE inhibitors were compared within three tertiles of baseline GFR. Delta GFR was comparable across all three tertiles, while the incidence of ESRD was higher in the bottom tertile than in the middle and top tertiles. Ramipril decreased Glomerular Filtration Delta by 22%, 22%, and 35% and ESRD incidence by 33% (P < 0.05), 37% and 100% (P < 0.01) in tertiles bottom, middle, and top, respectively. Reduction in delta GFR was predicted by baseline (P < 0.0001), diastolic (P = 0.02), and mean (P < 0.001) systolic BP and proteinuria (P < 0.0001), but not by baseline GFR (P = 0.12). ESRD risk reduction was predicted by baseline proteinuria (P < 0.01) and GFR (P < 0.0001) and was highly dependent on treatment duration (P < 0.0001). Adverse events were comparable between the three tertiles and within each tertile in the two treatment groups. Therefore, the progression of the disease and the response to ACE inhibition do not depend on the severity of renal failure. The risk of ESRD and the absolute number of events saved by ACE inhibition is higher in patients with the lowest GFR. However, renoprotection is maximized when ACE inhibition is started earlier and when prolonged treatment can result in stabilization of GFR and definitive prevention of ESRD.",0,0

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the treatment response rate differs with these medications in this setting. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, single-center, comparative study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of controlled-release nifedipine or lisinopril in the treatment of hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 mmHg) in renal transplant recipients treated with cyclosporine (CsA). accomplished. Recipients were randomized to receive lisinopril (10 mg once daily) or controlled-release nifedipine (30 mg once daily). The dose was doubled per indication. The number of responders (diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg in monotherapy) was addressed during the early post-transplant phase (first 3 months) and during a late post-transplant phase (3 to 12 months after kidney transplant) in the same patient population. One hundred fifty-four patients (nifedipine = 78, lisinopril = 76) with untreated hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 mmHg) were randomized within 3 weeks of kidney transplantation. One hundred twenty-three patients (nifedipine=69, lisinopril=54) completed the study. Fourteen (20%) recipients treated with nifedipine responded during the early postoperative phase and 26 (38%) during the late phase (months 4-12 after renal transplantation). Eleven (20%) of the lisinopril-treated recipients responded during the early phase and 18 (33%) during the late post-transplant phase. Non-responders were, on average, 8.5+/-1.5 kg heavier both at baseline and after 1 year of treatment (p<0.01), and 6.1+/-0, 9 years older than responders (p<0.05). In conclusion, these results indicate that both controlled-release nifedipine and lisinopril are equally effective in the treatment of post-transplant hypertension. As monotherapy, both drugs show a ""response rate"" of 20-38%, depending on the time interval after transplantation.",0,0

ALLHAT recruited patients from a variety of practice settings from February 1994 through January 1998. Sites were paid for randomizations and are paid for completed follow-up visits and documented study events. Communication and follow-up were facilitated by nine regional coordinating teams. It was recognized early on that patient recruitment would be a very large undertaking due to the number of participants (>40,000) required, the ambitious nature of the goal of recruiting African Americans (>55%), and the knowledge that many investigators they had limited experience recruiting participants for clinical trials. Multiple adjustments to ALLHAT's initial overall recruitment plan facilitated the achievement of sample size goals for both trial components. The experience gained from this large trial should be valuable in planning and implementing successful recruitment in future trials.",0,0

The efficacy and hormonal profile of omapatrilat and lisinopril were compared in salt-sensitive hypertensive patients. At enrollment, antihypertensive medications were withdrawn and patients received a single-blind placebo. On day 15 salt sensitivity determinations were made. Salt-sensitive hypertensive patients returned within 5 to 10 days for baseline assessments of ambulatory diastolic blood pressure, ambulatory systolic blood pressure, and atrial natriuretic peptide. Salt-sensitive hypertensive patients were randomized to receive double-blind omapatrilat (n=28) or lisinopril (n=33) at initial doses of 10 mg for 1 week, increasing to 40 and 20 mg, respectively, for an additional 3 weeks.

However, the role of shear stress, the relationship between endothelial and mechanical dysfunction, and the effect of chronic ACE inhibition on this relationship have not been investigated. The present study was designed to evaluate in patients with heart failure the relationship between flow-dependent dilation and radial artery mechanics at known levels of shear stress and to assess the effect of chronic ACE inhibition. Sixteen patients with stable congestive heart failure, who had never been treated with ACE inhibitors, participated in the study. Blood pressure, cardiac output (bioimpedance), radial artery diameter (echo tracking) and flow (Doppler), total blood viscosity, and mean arterial wall shear stress were assessed before and during an augmentation. gradual increase in forearm blood flow in response to gradual distal blood flow. heating of the skin of the hand. Radial artery cross-sectional compliance and compliance indices were calculated at 34°C, 40°C, and 44°C. Endothelium-independent vasodilation was assessed using glyceryl trinitrate. All parameters were assessed before and 24 hours after the last administration of perindopril (4 mg once daily) or placebo in a 2-month, double-blind, randomized study. Before treatment, there was no difference between the 2 groups for all parameters. After chronic ACE inhibition, systolic blood pressure decreased at baseline from 126+/-11 to 118+/-10 mm Hg (P<0.05). During warm-up, diameter increase in response to shear stress was greater after ACE inhibition than after placebo (time/treatment interaction, P<0.05). Also, in contrast to placebo, at the same shear stress, there was a significant increase in compliance (3.23+/-0.79 x 10(-7) to 6.82+/-2.47 x 10( -7) m(2)/kPa , P<0.05) and compliance (5.71+/-1.35 x 10(-3) to 8.87+/-1.88 x 10(-3) /kPa, P<0.05) during heating after ACE inhibition. The effect of glyceryl trinitrate did not change. The present study demonstrates that chronic administration of the ACE inhibitor perindopril increases the magnitude of flow-dependent dilatation and restores the flow-dependent increase in compliance and radial artery compliance assessed at stable shear stress. In addition, the decrease in baseline systolic blood pressure after ACE inhibitor suggests an associated increase in compliance of the proximal elastic duct arteries.",0,0

At baseline, radial artery diameter and flow were similar in CHF patients and controls; CHF patients had a modest but significant impairment in flow enhancement (-36%) and a striking impairment (-78%) in diameter enhancement after 4 minutes of ischemia. After 2 months, basal diameter and flow remained unchanged in all 4 groups. After 4 minutes of ischemia, radial artery flow and diameter increased as before in the standard treatment group (A), while in the other 3 groups the increase was significant (P<0.05) and, for the diameter, markedly (B, 83%, C, 92% and D, 95%) larger. Trinitroglycerin-induced vasodilation was similar in CHF and control subjects and was not affected by treatments. In CHF, the radial artery shows a marked reduction in flow-mediated vasodilation, reflecting impaired endothelial function.

This malfunction contributes to elevated aortic systolic pressures and thus the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. It was hypothesized that, in addition to structural vascular changes, functional changes as a result of hypervolemia and increased vasoconstrictor activity, particularly angiotensin II, play a role in decreased aortic compliance. Nineteen hemodialysis patients were studied before and 24 h after dry weight dialysis. Peripheral artery applanation tonometry was used to estimate aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), which is known to depend on aortic compliance and increased aortic systolic pressure (increase index [Aix]). Predialysis aortic PWV was increased in dialysis patients compared with matched healthy subjects (9.9 +/- 3.1 vs. 7.5 +/- 1.1 m/s; P < 0.05 ). AIx also increased (35 +/- 6 versus 25 +/- 10, P < 0.05). Dialysis volume reduction had no significant effect on PWV (9.3 +/- 1.5 m/s), but decreased AIx (28 +/- 7; P < 0.05). A subset of 10 patients was re-studied after 1 week of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with enalapril 5 mg once daily. ACEi lowered both predialysis and postdialysis BP, but had no effect on pulse pressure and heart rate, which remained elevated compared with healthy subjects. ACEi also decreased predialysis aortic PWV, from 11.0 +/- 3.5 to 9.1 +/- 2.1 m/s (P < 0.05), but had no significant effect on AIx . During ACEi treatment, the same dialysis volume reduction decreased aortic PWV further to 8.0 +/- 1.4 m/s (P < 0.05), a figure that does not differ from PWV in subjects healthy. AIx decreased to a value even slightly below normal (12 +/- 23; P < 0.05). It was concluded that volume overload and angiotensin II contribute to elevated PWV and AIx in dialysis patients. Volume reduction and ACEi improve aortic PWV and AIx. Combined volume reduction and ACEi have an enhanced effect which, in present patients, was so great that PWV and AIx were no longer elevated. Monitoring and correction of arterial pressure waveforms is feasible and can be an important tool in the treatment of patients with ESRD.",0,0

Meta-analyses demonstrated a statistically significant treatment benefit for all reported clinical outcomes in men of all ages and in black women. In women older than 54 years, antihypertensive treatment was associated with a significant reduction in fatal and nonfatal strokes, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Overall, there were no significant differences in the relative benefit of treatment in women and men; however, the absolute benefit of treatment was less in women than in men. Therefore, the number needed to treat for the endpoints of fatal stroke, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular events was one to three times higher for women than for men. Also, white women between the ages of 30 and 54 showed no benefit or harm from treatment. Data from the 6.7-year follow-up in the Hypertension Screening and Follow-up Program (HDFP) trial suggested that this group of younger women might benefit from a longer duration of treatment. The indications for pharmacological intervention seem quite clear for all subgroups, excluding these younger women. Until more evidence is available for this low-risk subgroup, current recommendations for lifestyle modification cannot be questioned.",0,0

Angioedema of the intestine induced by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors occurs in a minority of patients taking an ACE inhibitor. The clinical presentation includes acute abdominal symptoms, pronounced intestinal edema, and ascites with occasional facial and/or oropharyngeal swelling. AIAI is diagnosed based on the temporal relationship between symptomatic presentation and drug use, the absence of alternative diagnoses, including other causes of angioedema, and prompt resolution of symptoms after discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor. Prompt radiological investigation (abdominal computed tomography and/or ultrasound) is critical to making an early diagnosis and preventing unnecessary surgical interventions. There is a female predominance of AIAI, which may reflect the interaction of estradiol with the various pathways involved in the pathophysiology of AIAI. Management of AIAI consists mainly of conservative measures and discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be considered as suitable alternatives. Awareness and knowledge of AIAI is important due to the increasing use of ACE inhibitors, the current delays in making the diagnosis, the obvious management strategies once the diagnosis is made, and the lack of utility of alternative diagnoses, which which can lead to considerable morbidity. AIAI should be considered in patients taking ACE inhibitors who develop gastrointestinal discomfort regardless of duration of therapy.",0,0

This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel and controlled trial conducted in 11 Spanish hospitals. A total of 103 type 2 diabetic patients with stable albuminuria and BP not controlled with monotherapy were randomized, of whom 93 completed the study. After a 4-week single-blind placebo period, patients were randomized to receive verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 mg (VT) or enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/12.5 mg (EH). The duration of treatment was 6 months. The main outcome measures were changes in BP, 24-hour albuminuria, blood glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin. Overall BP was significantly reduced from 157.3 +/- 12.0/98.3 +/- 6.4 mm Hg to 140.5 +/- 14.5/86.1 +/- 8.2 mm Hg (P < 0.001) and albuminuria decreased significantly from 508.6 +/- 693.8 mg/24 h to 253.4 +/- 517.2 mg/24 h (P < 0.001), both without significant differences between treatments. Glycosylated hemoglobin was unchanged in VT: baseline, 5.91 +/- 1.43%; end of treatment, 5.94 +/- 1.62%, but increased in HE: baseline, 5.96 +/- 1.25%; final, 6.41 +/- 1.51%, (ANOVA interaction P = 0.040). At the end of the study, glycemia <126 mg/dl was achieved in 72.7% of the VT group, improving in 29.5% and worsening in 6.8% of patients (p = 0.021), and in 50% of the HD group, 13.6% of patients improved and 11.4% worsened (p = 1,000). There were no changes in body weight, serum creatinine, uric acid, potassium, cholesterol, triglycerides, and serum albumin. In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients not controlled on monotherapy, both treatments similarly reduced albuminuria. The verapamil/trandolapril combination seems to allow better metabolic control than enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide.",0,0

The primary outcome measures were cough and the total Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB) and subscales (anxiety, self-control, depression, general health, positive well-being, and vitality). The results were that 17.8% of enalapril patients and 13.2% of eprosartan patients withdrew from randomized treatment. Those taking enalapril were twice as likely to have a definite or possible cough at the end of the study as those taking eprosartan (7.6% vs. 3.2%) P = 0.099. At the end of monotherapy, the differences were greater (9.9% vs. 2.1%) and statistically significant, P = 0.001. Patients treated with enalapril, however, had small but significant improvements in measures of self-control and total PGWB compared with those receiving eprosartan.

Publications identified through MEDLINE were used. The text and bibliographies of retrieved articles were examined for additional references. Clinical trials with randomized comparative structure (placebo and active treatment arms) and controlled studies with other structures were included. Of the 27 citations identified, 22 studies were selected for inclusion and five were rejected. Two investigators independently extracted efficacy and safety data, lipid and carbohydrate profiles, and study and patient characteristics. Average pooled results showed beneficial effects of alpha1-selective blockers on serum total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic BP. The results also showed that doxazosin had beneficial effects on fasting glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, TC, HDL cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, HDL/TC ratio, and BP. systolic and diastolic. The risk difference was equivalent between the alpha1-blocker group and the control group for postural hypotension or syncope.

Physicians may be tempted to believe that their choice of antibiotic class to treat any given infection may alter the risk of CAD. Our objective was to determine if the use of antibiotics with antichlamydial activity in the general population reduces the risk of myocardial infarction. A health care claims database with 354,258 patients with continuous health and pharmacy coverage for at least 2 years between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1997, was used for analyses. were derived from proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates, relating antibiotic prescription to first incident myocardial infarction-related claim during the observation period, adjusting for prior CAD, age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. illness.

The results showed that captopril was associated with a non-significant reduction in mortality at 4 weeks (681 [9.1%] deaths allocated to captopril vs. 730 [9.7%] deaths allocated to placebo; 2P = 0.19 ), but long-term effects remain uncertain. The present study reports the long-term effect of early captopril treatment on mortality and other important events in patients with AMI from the earlier CCS-1 trial.; Long-term follow-up was performed in those hospitals that had recruited more than 20 cases in the CCS-1 trial. Thus, 8,000 patients with myocardial infarction were selected for long-term follow-up. Data were available for 6749 patients (84.4%). Patient characteristics were comparable between the treatment group (n = 3,391) and the placebo group (n = 3,358). The mean follow-up time was 23.4 +/- 16.9 months; the average age was 63.6 +/- 10.6 years, and 76.2% were men. At the end of the follow-up time, NYHA III-IV cardiac function was 9.0% in the treatment group and 9.8% in the placebo group; reinfarction rate was 5.6% vs. 6.0%; total cardiovascular events were 32.9% vs. 34.3%. Total mortality was 11.9% (n=404) vs. 13.8% (n=463), with a reduction of 13.8% in the captopril group (p=0.03). Cardiovascular mortality was 10.0% vs. 11.8% (P=0.01), death from heart failure was 4.1% vs. 5.5% (P=0.01). Based on the above results, it is estimated that early treatment with captopril can save 19 lives per 1,000 patients treated; patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or = 100 mm Hg at admission would have a long-term mortality of 12.4% in the treatment group vs. 13.8% in the placebo group (P = 0.04 ) and patients with a heart rate (HR) > or = 60/minute at admission would have a long-term mortality of 12.0% in the captopril groups versus 14.5% in the placebo group (P = 0 .01); Early treatment with captopril during AMI for 4 weeks can significantly reduce long-term total mortality.",1,1

Furthermore, few patients over the age of 80 have been enrolled in clinical trials, so the efficacy of current therapies for heart failure remains uncertain in this age group. Taken together, these factors contribute to the persistently high rates of hospitalization and mortality, as well as the poor quality of life associated with chronic heart failure in the elderly. This article reviews the nonpharmacologic aspects of care and pharmacotherapy of systolic heart failure in elderly patients. Optimal management requires a systematic approach comprising 5 key elements: coordination of care across disciplines, patient and caregiver education, improved self-management skills, effective follow-up, and judicious use of medications. However, it must be recognized that even with 'best practice' interventions, the prognosis for established heart failure remains poor.

The objective of this study was to compare the hemodynamic changes and tolerability of perindopril with captopril after AMI. We randomized 212 patients to receive captopril (n = 102) or perindopril (n = 110) within 72 hours of AMI. Captopril was administered at an initial dose of 6.25 mg, then 50 mg/day on day 1 and 100 mg/day thereafter. The corresponding doses of perindopril were 2, 4 and 8 mg/day. Acute hemodynamic changes, percentage of patients achieving target doses, and in-hospital and 6-month cardiovascular events were monitored.

Before the end of 15 months, 8 patients in the CSA group experienced CR and 4 patients experienced PR. One patient with CR relapsed when the CSA dose was reduced, so 7 patients remained in CR at the end of the first 15 months. No additional CR or PR was observed in the CAP group during late follow-up. At the last visit (a mean follow-up time of 44 months) in the CSA group, 2 other CR patients had relapsed and 1 CR patient switched to PR after stopping CSA treatment, thus 4 CR and 5 PR they remained in the CSA group. In the CAP group, 3 spontaneous CRs occurred beyond the year and a half of follow-up, with 3 CRs and 2 PRs at the last visit. No differences were found between the mean initial and final serum creatinine levels in either group. No serious adverse effects were found during treatment with CSA.

Tubulointerstitial fibrosis was found in 1 patient with recurrent RCC, whose serum creatinine increased above the normal range, but not in the other 2 patients whose serum creatinine remained in the normal range; CSA therapy at a dose of 5 mg.kg-1.d-1 is effective in inducing remission of nephrotic syndrome in adult patients with IMN within three months, with a response rate of 80%.

870,11794033,Angiotensin II antagonists versus ACE inhibitors in the treatment of arterial hypertension.,,"Andersen, R S; Christensen, S","Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system has proven to be an important principle in the pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular diseases. There is now overwhelming documentation of the beneficial effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on mortality and morbidity in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Such documentation is still missing for angiotensin II receptor antagonists which, in 1999, sold for 77% of the amount spent on ACE inhibitors in Denmark. This review assesses the therapeutic effects of angiotensin II antagonists compared to ACE inhibitors in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. From 21 comparative studies lasting up to one year, it can be concluded that the reduction in blood pressure with the two classes is similar. Both showed relatively few side effects, the only difference being a higher incidence of cough after ACE inhibitors. Until larger long-term comparative studies on mortality and morbidity are performed, angiotensin II antagonists should only be used in hypertensive patients who experience unacceptable side effects with ACE inhibitors.",0,0
871,11794428,review of vasopeptidase inhibitors: a new modality in the treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure.,,"Nathisuwan, Surakit; Talbert, Robert L","Vasopeptidase inhibitors are a group of agents capable of inhibiting neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzymes, leading to potentiation of the actions of natriuretic peptides and suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. With this distinctive characteristic mechanism, these agents have emerged as a new class of drugs for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Several vasopeptidase inhibitors are under clinical investigation. Omapatrilat is the most studied agent in this class. Clinical studies of omapatrilat in hypertension have consistently demonstrated the effectiveness of the agent in a variety of patient populations. In patients with heart failure, omapatrilat significantly improved neurohormonal and hemodynamic status. The long-term effects of omapatrilat in heart failure patients were recently compared with those of conventional therapy in a large phase II trial. The results of the study look promising. Large clinical trials are underway, and additional safety and efficacy information from these studies may help define this agent's place in therapy.",0,0

The primary outcome measure was change in sitSBP at endpoint; Least squares mean changes from baseline in sitSBP were -18.0 and -17.4 mmHg in the eprosartan and enalapril groups, respectively (eprosartan-enalapril difference -0.6, 95% confidence interval, CI, -4.1 to 3.0, p = 0.76). The corresponding figures for sitting DBP were -9.4 and -9.6 mmHg (eprosartan-enalapril difference 0.2, 95% CI -1.7 to 2.0, p = 0.84). Normalization and response rates were also similar in the two groups. Adverse events were recorded in 61 (35.7%) eprosartan patients (1 with dry cough) and 83 (50.9%) enalapril patients (10 with dry cough); Eprosartan and enalapril were equally effective in reducing SBP and DBP in elderly patients with predominantly systolic hypertension.

However, this cardioprotective effect of alcohol consumption in adults is absent at the population level. Approximately 20 to 30% of patients admitted to a hospital are alcoholics. In medical practice, it is essential to know the consumption levels of patients due to the many adverse effects that can result in the course of routine care. Ethanol damage to the heart is evident if alcohol consumption exceeds 90 to 100 g/day. Excessive ethanol consumption increases the risk of sudden cardiac death and cardiac arrhythmias. In patients with coronary heart disease, alcohol consumption was associated with higher mortality. An early response to alcohol consumption was an increased ventricular wall thickness-to-diameter ratio, possibly leading to continued consumption of alcoholic cardiomyopathy, which had a worse outcome compared to idiopathic dilative cardiomyopathy if not treated. stopped alcohol consumption or at least reduced it (< 60 g/d) . In the ICU, patients with chronic alcoholism have more postoperative cardiac complications. These complications are probably caused by biventricular dysfunction, particularly with the occurrence of severe infections or septic shock, events that are three to four times more frequent among chronic alcoholics than among occasional drinkers or nondrinkers. To prevent further complications from alcohol use and for long-term control of alcohol use, patients with alcohol abuse and heart failure should be treated in brief intervention and follow-up programs. The prognosis is good even in patients with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure caused by cardiomyopathy if complete abstinence is achieved. Failure to adhere to restrictions on smoking and alcohol use, which can be changed, dramatically increases the risk of hospital readmissions among heart failure patients.",0,0

We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of these drugs on plasminogen activator inhibitor antigen 1 (PAI-1), an inhibitor of fibrinolysis.; Participants with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=96, 51% black) were randomized after an initial 4 weeks of placebo to fosinopril 20 or 40 mg or amlodipine 5 or 10 mg daily for 4 weeks in a double-blind fixed dose. regime. After 4 weeks of placebo washout, patients received 4 weeks of crossover treatments. After placebo treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 143+/-2 and 86+/-1 mm Hg and plasma PAI-1 was 43.4+/-2.3 ng/mL. Amlodipine achieved a greater reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than fosinopril (10 mm Hg vs 8 mm Hg, P = 0.029 and 5 mm Hg vs 3 mm Hg, P = 0.040, respectively), but tended to increase PAI -1, while fosinopril tended to decrease PAI-1 (5.4+/-3.6 versus -3.8+/-2.5 ng/mL, P=0.045). PAI-1 changes were drug dose dependent (6.5+/-6.1 and 3.4+/-3.9 ng/mL with amlodipine 10 and 5 mg, respectively, and -0.4+ /-3.1 and -7.4+/-4.0 ng/mL with fosinopril 20 and 40 mg, respectively, P for trend 0.024). No significant differences were found between fosinopril and amlodipine in short-term changes in tissue plasminogen activator antigen, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6. Findings were similar in black and white participants.; Short-term treatment with fosinopril significantly reduced PAI-1 compared with amlodipine in a dose-dependent manner. This effect, which was independent of blood pressure reduction, may explain the better clinical results achieved with ACE inhibitors compared with calcium antagonists.",0,0
875,11817974,Treatment of heart failure in patients with diabetes mellitus.,,"Lavine, Steven J; Gellman, Steven D","Patients with diabetes mellitus have increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Both coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure (CHF) are largely responsible for the increase in cardiovascular adverse events in patients with diabetes. This review examines the pathophysiology of CHF, the mechanisms of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and the neurohormonal mechanisms involved in both LV dysfunction and CHF. Diabetes with and without hypertension is a major cause of LV dysfunction and CHF. Diabetes may be responsible for the metabolic and ultrastructural causes of LV dysfunction, while hypertension may be responsible for the marked fibrotic changes found. Experimental induction of diabetes in animals has shed light on the observed biochemical and ultrastructural changes. The role of insulin in reversing metabolic and structural changes is reviewed both from experimental data and from the limited amount of clinical data available. CHF therapy in patients with diabetes is similar to that in patients without diabetes, with therapy directed toward the use of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. As morbidity and mortality are higher in patients with diabetes, several studies have pointed to the importance of this subgroup where there is an opportunity to have significant clinical impact. There is a significant opportunity to reduce morbidity and mortality with beta blockers and ACE inhibitors when both ischemia and CHF are present. However, studies in patients with diabetes have been limited to post hoc subgroup analyzes and rarely to predefined subgroups. Clearly, clinical trials involving patients with diabetes with and without hypertension and LV dysfunction are needed in the future to adequately address the needs of this high-risk subgroup.",0,0
876,11817979,Quinapril: a new update on its pharmacology and therapeutic use in cardiovascular disorders.,,"Culy, Christine R; Jarvis, Blair","Quinapril is rapidly de-esterified after absorption to quinaprilat (the active diacid metabolite), a potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Quinapril produces favorable hemodynamic changes and improves ventricular and endothelial function in patients with various cardiovascular disorders; these effects are mediated by binding of quinaprilat to tissue and plasma ACE. Quinapril 10 to 40 mg/day provided effective blood pressure control in most patients with essential hypertension in clinical trials, but some patients required doses of 80 mg/day and/or concomitant diuretic therapy. In general, quinapril provided similar blood pressure control to other standard antihypertensive therapies, including other ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists in comparative clinical trials. Combination therapy with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide had a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either drug as monotherapy in two well-designed studies. Quinapril has also been shown to reduce microalbuminuria in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus. In patients with congestive heart failure, quinapril ≤ 40 mg/day produced beneficial hemodynamic and echocardiographic changes and improved exercise tolerance, symptoms, and functional class. The effects of quinapril on survival have not been investigated, but quinapril 10 to 20 mg/day showed comparable efficacy to captopril 25 to 50 mg twice daily in two well-designed trials. In patients with coronary artery disease, quinapril 40 mg/day significantly reduced the incidence of ischemic events after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in a well-controlled study (n = 148). However, a lower dose of quinapril (20 mg/day) showed no effect on ischemic events or atherosclerotic progression with 3 years of treatment in a similarly designed study involving 1750 patients undergoing coronary angioplasty. The tolerability of quinapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. In placebo-controlled trials, cough occurred in 2% and 4.3% and hypotension occurred in <1% and 2.9% of quinapril recipients with hypertension or congestive heart failure, respectively. No increase in adverse events was seen when the dose was increased from 10 to 40 mg/day; Quinapril is now firmly established as an effective and well-tolerated ACE inhibitor for the treatment of patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. Quinapril 40 mg/day also significantly reduced the incidence of ischemic events in patients undergoing CABG in one study; however, a lower dose of quinapril (20 mg/day) had no effect on ischemic events in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty in another trial. Further trials in patients with coronary artery disease receiving optimal doses of quinapril (40 mg/day) would be useful.",0,0

The analysis period was 7 years after randomization; Health care payer.; Clinical data were obtained from multiple medical centers in three European countries as described in published studies. Key economic data were obtained from the US Health Financing Administration's end-stage renal disease program; In the clinical studies on which this economic analysis was based, patients with chronic renal failure of various aetiologies were randomized to receive antihypertensive therapy with or without concomitant benazepril; During 7 years of analysis, patients randomized to antihypertensive treatment with concomitant benazepril therapy incurred an average of $12,991 (1999 values) lower medical costs than patients prescribed antihypertensive treatment without benazepril, and gained 0.091 years additional quality-adjusted lives (QALYs). Costs and QALYs were higher for the benazepril arm than for the placebo arm for all analysis years after the first. Stability of the rank order of the results in favor of the benazepril treatment arm was found in sensitivity analyzes of changes in key model parameters. Additional health and economic benefits in favor of patients receiving benazepril would be seen if the underlying model rates of dialysis and transplantation were increased, as may be appropriate to reflect differences in treatment practice in the US relative to European countries; Benazepril therapy as a component of antihypertensive treatment of people with chronic kidney disease initially costs money, but the investment costs are quickly recovered and the return on investment continues to grow. The impact of end-stage renal disease on a patient's health and health care costs is great. Therefore, the quality-adjusted survival benefits and overall cost savings observed in recipients of benazepril over a prolonged period (2 to 7 years) indicate that the strategy of prescribing benazepril to reduce the progression of kidney disease in patients with renal insufficiency is clinically and economically beneficial. compared with current antihypertensive regimens without ACE inhibition.",0,0

Twenty-two hypertensive subjects underwent psychological evaluation and treatment with 1) a diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ); 2) an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril; and 3) combined alpha + beta blockade (doxazosin + betaxolol). Anger-Out scores on the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory were positively correlated with HCTZ-induced fall in systolic blood pressure (p<0.01); Anger-In was negatively correlated with the fall in systolic pressure induced by quinapril (p<0.05). Target systolic blood pressure (130 mm Hg) was achieved with HCTZ or quinapril in 79% of subjects without childhood trauma versus 25% of subjects with childhood trauma (p = 0.03). Responses to doxazosin + betaxolol did not correlate with psychological characteristics. The authors conclude that both inhibited anger expression and childhood trauma are associated with a reduced response to a diuretic or ACE inhibitor. Combined alpha/beta blockade may be preferable to an ACE inhibitor or diuretic in the treatment of selected hypertensive patients. Further studies should include examination of psychological factors in terms of response to combined treatment with an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic.",0,0

Office blood pressure and heart rate and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were performed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks; Each active treatment, compared with placebo, lowered BP both during the morning hours and throughout the 24-hour period. Verapamil COER-24 was more effective in reducing morning systolic (-16.6 mm Hg) and diastolic (-11.9 mm Hg) BP than enalapril or losartan (p < 0.001). Throughout the 24-h period, the effects of COER-24 verapamil (-11.6/-8.4 mm Hg) were comparable to those of enalapril (-13.4/-8.3 mm Hg; P = NS ).

885,11825317,Angiotensin II receptor blockers for the treatment of hypertension.,,"See, S","The increasing incidence of stroke, congestive heart failure (CHF), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has pointed to the need for increased awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension. There continues to be a need for effective antihypertensive medications as hypertension is an important precursor to various forms of cardiovascular disease. The renin-angiotensin (AT) aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key component in the development of hypertension and may be a target of drug therapy. Angotensin II (ATII) receptor blockers (ARBs) are the newest class of agents available to treat hypertension, acting by inhibiting ATII at the receptor level. Currently, national consensus guidelines recommend that ARBs be reserved for hypertensive patients who cannot tolerate angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs). ARBs, however, are moving to the forefront of therapy with a promising role in the area of renoprotection and CHF. Recent trials such as the The renoprotective effect of the angiotensin receptor antagonist Irbesartan in patients with nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes (IDNT) trial, The Effect of irbesartan on the development of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes (IRMA2) and The Effects of Losartan on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy (RENAAL) has demonstrated the renoprotective effects of ARBs in patients with type 2 diabetes. The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) adds to the growing body of evidence that ARBs can improve morbidity and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. As a class, ARBs are well tolerated and have a lower incidence of cough and angioedema compared with ACEIs.

886,11825318,Pharmacotherapy of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus.,,"Deedwania, P C","The coexistence of hypertension and diabetes dramatically and synergistically increases the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Overwhelming evidence supports aggressive treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients. However, only a small percentage of diabetic hypertensive patients reach their treatment goal of blood pressure (BP) < 130/80 mmHg. Tight BP control is not only cost effective but also more rewarding than glycemic control. The optimal target for BP control in diabetics should be 130/80 mmHg. In subjects with diabetes and renal insufficiency, BP should be lowered to 125/75 mmHg to slow the progression of renal insufficiency. The choice of an antihypertensive agent should be based on proven effects on morbidity and mortality rather than surrogate parameters such as lipids or glucose. Limited data suggest that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) is the agent of choice, especially in those with proteinuria or renal insufficiency. beta-blockers (betaB) may be the first-line agent in diabetics with coronary heart disease, while thiazide diuretics (TDs) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are second-line drugs. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) can be shown to be as effective as ACE inhibitors in diabetics with hypertension. Alpha-adrenergic antagonists (AAAs) should be avoided. Most hypertensive patients require more than one agent to control their BP. There is no evidence to support one combination regimen over another; however, a combination of an ACEI with a DT or a betaB may be the most cost-effective regimens compared to other combinations.",0,0

Cutaneous side effects of captopril include angioedema, anaphylactoid reactions, maculopapular rashes, pityriasis rosea-like rash, toxic erythema, and exfoliative dermatitis. Some of the immunological cutaneous adverse reactions induced by captopril have been diagnosed in recent years by patch tests. A case of an immunocutaneous adverse reaction to captopril with tolerance to enalapril and lisinopril demonstrated by both patch tests and double-blind challenge tests is reported for the first time. A 71-year-old nonatopic woman developed a generalized pruritic maculopapular rash. Two months earlier, he had started oral treatment with captopril 50 mg tid and glibenclamide 5 mg daily. After the rash appeared, he stopped both medications and the reaction disappeared. A skin biopsy of one of the lesions showed a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate of the upper dermis. Skin prick tests with captopril and glibenclamide and patch tests with enalapril, lisinopril, and glibenclamide at 1% and 10% pet, and with mercaptobenzothiazole (a chemical containing a sulfhydryl group at 1% pet) were negative. .

Double-blind oral challenge tests with glibenclamide, enalapril, lisinopril, and placebo showed good tolerance. The patient was advised to avoid captopril alone. Because captopril is the only ACE inhibitor that contains a sulfhydryl group and has occasionally been implicated in complex immune diseases, this chemical group has been considered to be the culprit in allergic reactions to captopril. Lack of cross-reactivity between captopril, enalapril and benazepril has been shown in some patients by patch testing.

To assess the relationships between ST recovery, infarct-related arterial flow, and late survival, we studied 766 patients with electrocardiograms recorded at a median of 167 minutes after thrombolytic therapy. Angiography was performed at 3 weeks and follow-up was at a median of 6.3 years (interquartile range [IQR] 5.0-8.4). At 10 years, survival rates were 55% (95% CI 43-70) in patients with <30% ST recovery in the single lead with maximal ST elevation, 71% (95% CI 64-79 ) in those with 30% to 70% ST recovery, and 74% (95% CI 68-82) in those with >70% ST recovery (P = 0.0005), whereas ST recovery measured as the sum of ST deviation voltage changes (elevation or depression) or ST elevation was not associated with 10-year survival (log-rank test, P = 0.06 and P = 0, 34, respectively).

Treatment was started 3 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms. On day 1, patients received a single dose of captopril 6.25 mg, trandolapril 0.5 mg, or placebo in the morning. The treatment was then titrated up for the next 5 days. Blood pressure was monitored with an automated device for the first 12 hours after dosing on day 1. Conventional blood pressure measurements were performed throughout the study; Of 205 patients treated in the study, the effects of the first dose were evaluated in 193 patients. In the captopril group, the maximum decrease in blood pressure occurred after 2 hours, and the magnitude of this decrease was significantly greater than in the other 2 groups: 8.8 +/- 12/6.3 +/- 8 mm Hg (captopril) versus 5.4 +/- 10/3.1 +/- 8 mm Hg (trandolapril) versus 2.4 +/- 9/1.4 +/- 7 mm Hg (placebo) (p <0.01).

At randomization, hypertension was well controlled (< or = 95 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, with or without concomitant thiazide diuretics. Hypertension therapy continued for the 52 weeks of the study. Sibutramine 20 mg produced significantly greater weight loss compared to placebo: 4.5 kg with sibutramine compared with 0.4 kg with placebo (last observation carried forward (LOCF); P < or = 0.05).

Changes in pulse rate at week 52 were a decrease of 0.3 beats per minute (bpm) for placebo treatment compared to an increase of 5.7 bpm for sibutramine treatment (p < 0.001). Mandatory study withdrawals due to protocol-defined BP changes were not statistically different between the two treatment groups. The more favorable changes in lipid profile, serum glucose, and uric acid could be explained by the greater weight losses that occurred in the sibutramine treatment group. Sibutramine was well tolerated. This study indicates that in obese patients whose hypertension is well controlled early on with an ACE inhibitor, with or without concomitant thiazide diuretic therapy, sibutramine achieves safe and effective weight loss without compromising good BP control.",0,0

The benefits of active treatment were not independently related to gender or the presence of cardiovascular complications at admission. The antihypertensive regimen was more effective in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes at baseline. Additional analyzes also suggested benefits in patients taking nitrendipine as sole therapy. The per-protocol analysis largely confirmed the intention-to-treat results.

Subjects were randomized to intensive (10 mm Hg below baseline DBP) versus moderate (80 to 89 mm Hg) DBP control. Patients in the moderate therapy group received placebo, while patients randomized to intensive therapy received blinded nisoldipine or enalapril as initial antihypertensive medication. The primary endpoint assessed was change in creatinine clearance with secondary endpoints consisting of change in urinary albumin excretion, progression of retinopathy and neuropathy, and incidence of cardiovascular disease; The mean follow-up was 5.3 years.

It is often multifactorial in this group. The most common causes are hypertension and coronary heart disease, with valvular heart disease playing an increasingly important role. The most common trigger of pre-existing heart failure is noncompliance with medication or diet; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are particularly likely to exacerbate the condition. Diagnosis can be difficult as typical signs are often absent or masked in older people, but plasma brain natriuretic peptide levels appear to be a reliable indicator and may provide a diagnostic test in the future. Systolic heart failure is treated with conventional therapy (diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers). Management of diastolic heart failure is less well defined, but symptoms must be managed, ischemia prevented, and underlying causes identified and treated.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is important for cardiovascular growth. There is substantial experimental evidence in animals that the angiotensin II antagonist losartan decreases the cardiac hypertrophy response caused by elevated blood pressure as well as intravascular volume overload. However, data in humans are scarce. This is a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design study in 50 patients with essential hypertension. The results show that both drugs reduced blood pressure with the same efficacy and also left ventricular mass (P < 0.001). After 3 years of treatment, glomerular filtration rate was significantly increased with losartan (P < 0.005). Serum uric acid decreased modestly but significantly, as a function of dose, in losartan patients compared to an increase in enalapril patients. A drop in serum potassium from the pre-study period was observed in all patients. There was no difference between treatments in patient satisfaction with quality of life. Both drugs have a relatively similar hormonal and hemodynamic effect, with an excellent tolerability profile; appear to induce comparable blood pressure drops in hypertensive patients, in particular, therapy based on specific Ang II blockade may offer advantages in high-risk hypertensives if there is left ventricular hypertrophy. Both enalapril and losartan, by improving renal function by attenuating the intrarenal effects of angiotensin II, could be capable of reversing the pathophysiology of essential hypertensive kidney disease, and should be drugs of first choice in the treatment of essential hypertension.",0,0

Angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1-R) antagonists can reverse LVH independently of the hypotensive effect in the setting of ESRD. Thirty uraemic patients with chronic hemodialysis and hypertension were randomly assigned to receive the AT1-R antagonist losartan (n = 10), the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACD) inhibitor enalapril (n = 10), or the calcium channel blocker amlodipine (n = 10). n = 10). Left ventricular mass index (LVM) was measured by echocardiography before and 6 months after treatment. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics did not differ between the three groups. The initial mean LVM index also did not differ in the three groups. After 6 months of treatment, treatment with losartan significantly reduced the LVM index (-24.7 +/- 3.2%) than therapy with amlodipine (-10.5 +/- 5.2%) or enalapril ( -11.2 +/- 4.1%). All three groups had a similar decrease in mean arterial pressure with treatment. Plasma concentration of angiotensin II increased 5-fold with losartan treatment. In contrast, plasma angiotension II concentration did not change with enalapril and only increased 2-fold with amlodipine.

A third study examined whether increasing the dose of lisinopril affected subsequent vascular ACE inhibition; In the cross-sectional study, vascular conversion from AI to AII was significantly reduced in NYHA class III compared to class I/II (p < 0.05). In the longitudinal study, vascular ACE inhibition was significantly reduced at 18 months compared to baseline (p < 0.001), suggesting a gradual reactivation of vascular ACE in CHF over time. In the third study, tissue ACE inhibition could be restored by increasing the dose of the ACE inhibitor; Vascular AI/AII conversion is reactivated over time during chronic ACE inhibitor therapy, even if the CHF disease process is clinically stable. It also occurs as the CHF disease process progresses. Even if vascular AI/AII conversion has been reactivated, it can be suppressed by increasing the dose of the ACE inhibitor.",0,0

Retrospective cohort study.; Despite evidence showing the benefit of treating LVSD with ACEIs, elderly LVSD patients are often not treated with an ACEI. Concern that the risk of ACE inhibitor therapy may outweigh the benefits in elderly patients is one possible reason; We obtained records for 2,943 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for congestive heart failure at 69 hospitals in five states. The presence of LVSD was determined from recorded ejection fractions or a narrative description of ventricular function. Discharge medications and doses were summarized.; Mortality was followed for one year using the MEDPRO files of the Health Care Financial Administration; There were 621 patients aged 65 years or older with LVSD. The mean age (SD) was 77.4 years (7.0). At discharge, 79% were prescribed an ACEI and, of these, 47% were discharged at the dose recommended by the clinical practice guidelines. There were 195 deaths (31.4%) during the year of follow-up. Compared with patients discharged on a recommended dose of ACE inhibitors, patients who were not prescribed an ACE inhibitor at discharge had an adjusted hazard ratio for death (95% CI) of 1.63 (1 .02, 2.60) and patients prescribed an ACE inhibitor at a lower dose than recommended had a hazard ratio of 1.30 (0.86, 1.97); Our results show that the use of ACE inhibitors at discharge in elderly patients with LVSD is associated with a lower risk of death.",0,0

This study sought to investigate whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, facilitator of bradykinins, algesic peptides, and/or an AT1 receptor antagonist can modify hypertension-related hypoalgesia in humans. The study was approved by the ethics committee of our Department.; A total of 22 hypertensive patients underwent dental pulp stimulation to obtain dental pain threshold and tolerance, and 24-h blood pressure monitoring along with a control group of 55 normotensive patients. Hypertensives were then randomized to treatment with enalapril or losartan and were reassessed (dental pain perception and ambulatory monitoring) after 8 weeks of the first treatment and after an additional 8 weeks of the second treatment; Untreated hypertensive subjects showed reduced perception of painful stimuli compared to normotensive subjects. A significant reduction in both pain threshold and tolerance was observed during antihypertensive treatments (Friedman's test: P = 0.007 and P = 0.006, respectively). Pain sensitivity was similar during the two treatments and did not differ from the pain sensitivity values of normotensive controls. ANCOVAs were calculated to assess the relationship between antihypertensive agents and pain sensitivity, after controlling for blood pressure. A 24-hour mean pressure served as a covariate, removing any effect of blood pressure; a significant difference was observed when both pain threshold and tolerance were entered as dependent variables (F = 5.28, P = 0.0076; F = 8.16, P = 0.0007, respectively); Both the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and the AT1 receptor blocker losartan acted similarly on pain threshold and tolerance, increasing pain sensitivity during the two antihypertensive treatments. The reduction in blood pressure while taking the drug could not explain the observed changes in pain sensitivity. The latter may be due to a specific pharmacodynamic mechanism mediated by angiotensin II AT1 receptors.",0,0

However, because office blood pressure measurements to some extent reflect blood pressure outside the office, a side-arm INSIGHT study was also conducted in which patients underwent both office measurement and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; The study had a parallel group, randomized, double-blind design. After 4 weeks of placebo, patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were randomized to receive either nifedipine GITS 30 mg or amiloride 2.5 + hydrochlorothiazide 5 mg for 3.1 years. Dose titration was performed by doubling the dose and adding atenolol 25-50 mg or enalapril 5-10 mg, or other drugs when necessary. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis and included calculation of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate values, day and night. Additional analyzes included calculation of the minimum-maximum ratio and the uniformity index (the ratio of the mean blood pressure reductions in 24 hours after treatment to their standard deviation); A total of 151 patients were recruited and 149 were valid for analysis: 78 patients had 24-h outpatient records both at baseline and during treatment and 134 during treatment. Both treatments significantly and similarly reduced office, 24-hour, and day-night blood pressures. Ambulatory and office heart rate were not changed by diuretics, while nifedipine reduced it slightly. Median trough-to-peak ratios were always >0.5 and overlapping between the two treatment groups. Similarly, the smoothness indices of systolic and diastolic blood pressures were comparatively high for nifedipine and diuretics, demonstrating a similar and well-balanced antihypertensive response for both drugs. No significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups in the number of cardiovascular events (17 in the nifedipine-based treatment group and 26 in the diuretic-based treatment group); In the INSIGHT study, the long-term antihypertensive effect on 24-hour blood pressure and cardiovascular protection of nifedipine was similar to that of diuretics.",0,0
909,11875587,Vasopeptidase inhibition: a novel approach to cardiovascular therapy.,,"Floras, John S","Omapatrilat was designed to simultaneously inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). The ubiquitous involvement of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, originally conceived as a hub of sodium and fluid metabolism in inflammation, thrombosis, and hypertrophy of smooth and cardiac muscle, is an important factor in disease progression in conditions as diverse as hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease and diabetes. Interruption of angiotensin II generation and bradykinin degradation by ACE inhibition is an important therapeutic advance in the management of these diseases. NEP metabolizes both bradykinin and natriuretic peptides (atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, c-type natriuretic peptide, and adrenomedullin). These peptides counteract the adverse effects of angiotensin II through their neural vasodilatory, natriuretic, diuretic, and autonomic actions; for its antitrophic effects; and suppressing plasma renin activity. These two systems can be considered key components of a cardiorenal axis that maintains blood pressure and cardiopulmonary blood volume within a stable range. This balance is compromised in the setting of heart failure and primary hypertension. The combination of ACE inhibition and NEP should increase the beneficial haemodynamic and tissue effects of bradykinin and natriuretic peptides. Vasopeptidase inhibition, therefore, is a novel approach to cardiovascular therapy, with implications for hypertension, heart failure, renal function, and ischemic heart disease.",0,0

However, their effects in transplant recipients without PE are uncertain, and the mechanism by which they reduce Hb levels in patients with PE remains unclear. This study evaluated the effects of losartan and enalapril on Hb levels relative to serum erythropoietin (EPO) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels in 8 patients with PE and 10 patients without PE. PET. The 18 patients were treated sequentially with 24 weeks of losartan therapy, followed by 24 weeks of enalapril therapy; the two treatment phases were separated by a washout period. Patients with PE showed significantly higher baseline Hb and IGF-1 concentrations compared to patients without PE before losartan and enalapril treatments. Baseline serum EPO levels were similar for patients with and without PE. Baseline Hb level was significantly correlated with IGF-1 level (r = 0.517, P = 0.002), but not with EPO level. Treatment with enalapril 5 mg reduced Hb levels more markedly than treatment with losartan 50 mg in patients with PE. In patients without PE, enalapril 5 mg slightly reduced Hb levels, whereas losartan 50 mg had no significant Hb-lowering effect. The reduction in Hb levels with enalapril treatment in patients with PE was associated with a significant reduction in circulating levels of IGF-1, but not EPO, whereas losartan reduced Hb levels without significant changes in circulating levels. circulating IGF-1 and EPO. In patients without PE, no significant changes in serum EPO and IGF-1 levels were observed with either treatment. The differential Hb-lowering effect of losartan and enalapril treatment in patients with and without PE suggests that the pathogenesis of PE is complex and heterogeneous. Different erythropoietic mechanisms may be involved in patients with and without PE. Further large-scale studies are needed to determine the exact interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and the regulation of IGF-1 and EPO synthesis and to define the exact mechanism by which losartan and enalapril reduce Hb levels.",0,0

Individual responses to the two drugs were poorly correlated (for diastolic pressure: r=0.19, p=0.11; for systolic pressure: r=-0.01, p=0.92). For ACE-I, the fall in systolic and diastolic BP was related to pretreatment PRA (for diastolic pressure: r=0.31, p=0.008; for systolic pressure: r=0.24, p =0.04). In the case of ARA, no relationship was observed between the drop in BP and PRA. These observations suggest that more complex mechanisms may be involved in BP reduction with ARB than with ACE-I.",0,0

The study was a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled design, with patients randomized 2:1 to receive either telmisartan or enalapril. After a two-week placebo run-in period, the 71 eligible patients received telmisartan 40 mg or orenalapril 10 mg once daily for four weeks. Thereafter, doses were adjusted to telmisartan 80 mg or enalapril 20 mg once daily if supine trough DBP remained > or = 90 mmHg. After another four weeks, the dose was further adjusted, as necessary, to telmisartan 80 mg or enalapril 20 mg, or furosemide was given in addition if the double dose was already being administered. Mean decreases in Ccr of 4.6% for telmisartan and 2.8% for forenalapril were not clinically significant. Adverse events occurred in 12 (26.7%) patients treated with telmisartan and in 12 (46.2%) patients receiving enalapril. The mean supine trough DBP reduction from baseline to last available value was 12.5 mmHg for telmisartan compared to 11.9 mmHg for enalapril. A complete (> or = 10 mmHg reduction) or partial (7-9 mmHg reduction) response occurred in 78% of patients on telmisartan and 65% of patients on enalapril. In the enalapril group, 43% of patients required furosemide, compared to 29% in the telmisartan group. In conclusion, telmisartan has no deleterious effects on renal function, is effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in patients with moderate renal insufficiency, and is comparable to enalapril.",0,0

Prescriptions were collected during May and June 2000 to form a study population of 1266 diabetic-hypertensive patients; As monotherapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (37.9%) and beta-blockers (38.3%) were the most commonly prescribed classes of antihypertensives by FPs and GPs, respectively. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) ranked third in both physician categories. For two-drug combinations, a beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor was the combination of choice for both categories of physicians. Patients managed by FPs were more likely to receive a combination of beta-blockers and CCBs (17.4 vs. 14.9%) or a combination of diuretics and ACE inhibitors (16.7 vs. 11.4%) and less likely to receive a combination of beta-blockers and diuretics (11.8 vs. 16.7%) than those managed by general practitioners. The proportion of patients who received antihypertensive combinations was 40.6 and 38.5% for FP and GP, respectively. While clinicians more often prescribed CCBs as monotherapy to the elderly, the choice for FPs was a beta-blocker. Diuretics were less preferred by both MFs and MGs. ACE inhibitor-beta blocker was again the most preferred combination of FP and GP. GPs prescribed beta-blocker-CCB combinations more often than GPs (P = 0.01), while ACE inhibitor-CCB combinations were less preferred (P = 0.09). A trend towards overuse of short-acting nifedipine as monotherapy for elderly patients was noted by both GPs and GPs. Glibenclamide, alone or in combination with metformin, was the main antidiabetic drug prescribed by general practitioners and general practitioners. Middle-aged patients (45-64 years) treated by GPs were more likely to receive glibenclamide than those treated by FP (P = 0.001) and less likely to receive gliclazide (P = 0.01). GPs much more frequently prescribed combinations of a beta-blocker with glibenclamide or insulin; Within the same practice setting, a substantial difference was observed between GPs and GPs in terms of preference for different drug classes in the treatment of diabetic hypertension. Compliance with both FPs and GPs was suboptimal; However, in general, compliance with the PFs was closer to the recommended guidelines.

In December 1999 [351207], [353287], an NDA for the use of omapatrilat in hypertension was filed with the FDA and EU regulatory authorities. In April 2000, BMS voluntarily withdrew the NDA in response to questions from the FDA regarding the comparative incidence and severity of a rare side effect (angioedema) reported in the NDA database. Prospective controlled clinical studies in patients with hypertension and heart failure should continue. In May 2001, BMS reported that its blinded hypertension study with omapatrilate was continuing and, pending supporting results from an anticipated data analysis in late summer or early fall 2001, the company expected to resubmit a FDA NDA [409203]. In July 2000, BMS reported that it planned to conduct a multinational study of 25,000 patients (OCTAVE - Omapatrilat Versus Enalapril Cardiovascular Treatment Evaluation) to compare the efficacy and safety of omapatrilat vs. enalapril in the treatment of hypertension [374909] .

ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) lower MA and are neutral on total cholesterol and triglycerides. However, the effect of ACE inhibitors and CCBs on lipid subfractions such as Lp(a), apolipoprotein (apo) A1, apo B, and others is unclear. The current study tests the hypothesis that a fixed-dose combination of an ACE inhibitor, benazepril (B) with the dihydropyridine CCB, amlodipine (A), will further lower blood pressure and reduce atherogenic lipid fractions compared with any of the agents alone. A multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group design was used to study 27 participants with type 2 diabetes. Measurements of total cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL), triglycerides, apo A1, apo B, Lp(a), MA, blood pressure, and creatinine clearance at baseline and at 12-week intervals during the 36-week study; Blood pressure was significantly reduced at 36 weeks in all three groups (P=0.0078 for A, P=0.0039 for B, and P=0.0313 for A+B). MA was reduced in all groups with relatively greater reductions in groups B (P < 0.05) and A+B (P < 0.03) versus A. An increase in mean HDL cholesterol from baseline was observed in groups B and A+B; P < 0.05), but not in group A. A trend between increased HDL cholesterol and decreased MA was also observed in groups B and A+B. Furthermore, only group B exhibited a decrease in the median value of Lp(a) (P < 0.05).; These data support the concept that ACE inhibition with B reduces the atherogenic profile by lowering Lp(a) and increasing HDL cholesterol, the latter correlating with reductions in MA. While A+B exhibited similar trends in lipid subfractions and MA as B, this group had the greatest reduction in systolic blood pressure of the three groups. Therefore, the use of A+B offers the benefits of a reduced atherogenic profile with a higher probability of achieving target blood pressure as recommended by national guidelines.",0,0

Essential hypertensive normoalbuminuric patients <50 years of age, who had not been previously treated with antihypertensive drugs and who did not suffer from diabetes mellitus were included. After initial evaluation, patients were treated using only non-pharmacological measures (n=62), beta blockers (n=38), ACE inhibitors (n=64), calcium channel blockers (n=8) and several classes (n= 15). Office blood pressure, biochemical profile, and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion measurements were taken at the start of the study and measured annually for an average of 2.7+/-1.2 years of follow-up. Of the 187 patients included, 22 (11.7%) developed microalbuminuria (progressors, 4.4/100 patients/year). There were no differences between the progressors and those who remained normoalbuminuric (non-progressors) in terms of age, sex, body mass index, disease duration, blood pressure values, biochemical profile, family history of diabetes or hypertension, smoking or presence of EKG left ventricular hypertrophy. The group with the lowest rate of progression was that of patients treated with ACE inhibitors (n=5; 2.9/100 patients/year), followed by the diet group (n=5; 3.3/100 patients/year) and the beta-blocker group (n=5; 4.1/100 patients/year). When we excluded patients treated with calcium channel blockers or those who switched over time between different classes of treatment, no significant difference in the incidence of microalbuminuria was observed between groups. Progressors showed higher slopes for fasting glucose (4.78+/-11.4 vs. 0.50+/-6.8 mg/year, P<0.02) and uric acid (0.58+/-11.4). -0.93 vs. 0.05+/-1.10 mg/year, P<0.03) compared to the slopes of non-progressors. Both glucose and systolic blood pressure slopes over time were independently associated with the slope of the logarithm of urinary albumin excretion when adjusted for age, sex, and treatment groups.

The ACE D/I polymorphism was characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 265 subjects from the Healing and Early Afterload Reducing Therapy study, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether early or late ACE-I, ramipril, in patients with acute myocardial infarction of the anterior wall would be optimal to reduce LV enlargement. The selected frequencies for the ACE D and I alleles were 0.59 and 0.41 (high-dose placebo group), 0.56 and 0.44 (low-dose-low-dose group), and 0.60 and 0. 40 (high dose-high dose group), respectively. All observed genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no evidence of an association between genotype and outcome with respect to LV size or function, or with baseline blood pressure response after ACE-I administration (adjusted for covariates). Our data do not provide evidence of an association of the ACE D/I polymorphism with the risk of LV remodeling after myocardial infarction in the presence of ACE-I therapy and, therefore, do not suggest that the differential clinical efficacy of inhibitors of the RCT is related to this. genetic marker.",0,0

Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to receive an implantable defibrillator (742 patients) or conventional medical therapy (490 patients). Invasive electrophysiological tests were not required for risk stratification. Death from any cause was the end point.; Clinical characteristics at baseline and prevalence of medication use at the time of the last follow-up visit were similar in the two treatment groups. During an average follow-up of 20 months, mortality rates were 19.8 percent in the conventional therapy group and 14.2 percent in the defibrillator group. The hazard ratio for the risk of death from any cause in the defibrillator group compared with the conventional therapy group was 0.69 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.93; P = 0.016).

Enalapril and eprosartan, alone and in combination, were used to determine their short-term effects on the renal nitric oxide system and renal hemodynamics in human subjects with essential hypertension; Twenty Caucasian patients (27 +/- 1 years) with mild essential hypertension (143 +/- 11/95 +/- 6 mm Hg) were included in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, four-fold crossover study. study with placebo, enalapril (20 mg/day), eprosartan (600 mg/day), or a combination of both drugs (10 and 300 mg/day, respectively) each for a period of one week followed by a washout phase of two weeks. After each phase of the study, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) were determined. Basal nitric oxide synthesis from the renal vasculature was assessed by the decrease in RPF after nitric oxide synthase inhibition with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 4.25 mg/kg); After one week of treatment, combination treatment reduced occasional blood pressure by 5 +/- 2/3 +/- 1 mm Hg compared with placebo (P < 0.01).

936,11934344,Treatment options for renovascular hypertension.,,"Spence, J David","Renovascular hypertension is usually caused by atherosclerotic narrowing of the renal artery origin and is much more common than previously thought among patients with peripheral vascular disease, carotid stenosis, or heart failure. Renovascular hypertension must be distinguished from renal artery stenosis. In true renovascular hypertension, the kidney takes over the blood pressure and will do whatever it takes to raise the blood pressure enough to force blood through the blocked artery. This can be diagnosed with functional tests that measure glomerular filtration rate before and after blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor subtype AT(1) antagonists. There are insufficient data to make evidence-based recommendations on the management of renovascular hypertension. There are only two randomized trials of angioplasty versus medical treatment and of these, the largest was severely contaminated by angioplasty among the group initially allocated medical treatment. There is only one trial of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition versus alternative medical treatment. Drugs that are most effective in the medical treatment of renovascular hypertension (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-1 receptor blockers) tend to be avoided for fear of a very rare complication (acute renal failure in patients with severe stenosis of the angiotensin). both kidneys). arteries, or the artery to a single remaining kidney). This fear is misplaced not only because it is rare (<5% of patients with renovascular hypertension) but also because it is reversible and treatable by revascularization. Patients with renovascular hypertension should be evaluated by nuclear medicine with differential glomerular filtration rate, potentiated by renin-angiotensin system blockers. If medical therapy is ineffective or causes serious impairment of renal function, revascularization is required. Some experts favor surgical revascularization because of the occasional failure of angioplasty and the risk of impaired renal function after angioplasty.",0,0

The observation of a patient whose pemphigus vulgaris (PV) worsened after taking fosinopril prompted us to study an experimental way to assess liability. Normal human skin (NHS) sections were simultaneously incubated for 2, 6, 12, and 24 h at 4 °C with progressively diluted solutions of fosinopril and captopril and used as indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) substrates for 2 sera containing anti-desmoglein. -3 (anti-Dsg3 antibodies) at a dilution of 1/160. With captopril, IIF was negative, regardless of dilution and incubation time. Only at the 1/40,000 dilution was IIF positive. With fosinopril, IIF was negative for the 2 and 6 hour incubations, but became positive after 12 hours and remained so with all other solutions and incubation times. The negativity of IIF with captopril suggests that the anti-Dsg3 antibodies contained in the PV sera were unable to find molecules in the NHS to bind to. Therefore, captopril would induce acantholysis by blocking adhesion molecules. With fosinopril, on the other hand, a partial blockade of adhesion molecules was observed only with the highly concentrated solution, which is unlikely to occur in vivo. Fosinopril is therefore probably unable to block adhesion molecules in vivo. Our method could be used to verify the acantholytic properties of a drug.",0,0

The key event is the increase in glomerular capillary pressure; this alters glomerular protein permeability and allows excessive amounts of protein to reach the lumen of the proximal tubule. The secondary process of filtered protein reabsorption may contribute to renal interstitial injury by activating intracellular events, including the upregulation of genes encoding vasoactive and inflammatory mediators. Both interstitial inflammation and disease progression can be controlled with drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which strengthen the glomerular protein permeability barrier and thus limit proteinuria and protein-dependent inflammatory signals. filtered. Clinical data strongly suggest that remission can now be achieved in some patients with chronic kidney disease. However, due to the current time lag between initiation of treatment and remission, a substantial proportion of patients still progress to ESRD before renal function begins to stabilize.

Genetically predisposed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors develop severe hypertensive nephrosclerosis without the need for surgical reduction of renal mass, nephrectomy, renal infarction or nephrotoxic drugs. In these animals, endothelial dysfunction is considered a valid model to assess the efficacy of cardiovascular therapy. SHRs were treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril or the angiotensin II (Ang II) AT(1) receptor antagonist (AIIA) valsartan at subhypotensive doses and monitored for effects on survival rates and cardiac and renal changes. Rats treated with valsartan, alone or in combination with enalapril, showed markedly higher survival rates (67-85%, respectively) than untreated animals (37%) or those treated with enalapril alone (55%). Valsartan at a dose that attenuated the increase in blood pressure led to even higher survival rates (95%). Despite these better survival rates, at nonhypotensive doses, the drugs had no effect on histologic appearance, nor did they improve kidney function. Plasma creatinine levels were reduced with valsartan, alone or in combination with enalapril, but proteinuria persisted with all treatments through the 12-week study.

Lercanidipine is a new DHP CCB effective for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. Compared to other DHP CCBs, lercanidipine has a molecular design that imparts greater solubility within the arterial cell membrane bilayer, membrane-controlled kinetics, and a high cholesterol tolerance factor. These favorable membrane-controlled kinetics impart a gradual onset of vasodilation and a long-lasting action. Furthermore, the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of lercanidipine appear to contribute to its efficacy and favorable safety profile. In clinical trials in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, lercanidipine was administered at an initial dose of 10 mg once daily and increased to 20 mg once daily for non-responders. Studies have shown that lercanidipine has a 24-hour antihypertensive effect and does not cause a significant increase in heart rate. Lercanidipine has been shown to be effective in a wide range of hypertensive patients, including mild to moderate hypertension, severe hypertension, the elderly, and those with isolated systolic hypertension.

952,11981287,Renal aspects of the term and preterm newborn: a selective update.,,"Drukker, Alfred; Guignard, Jean-Pierre","This review discusses new aspects of normal and abnormal kidney development that further our understanding of the adaptation of neonatal kidneys to the stress of extrauterine life. Some errors in the measurement of the glomerular filtration rate in the newborn, caused mainly by postnatal fluctuations in serum creatinine levels, are highlighted. Serum creatinine levels correlate with our recent finding of tubular reabsorption of creatinine in the immature neonatal kidney. Poor kidney development in premature and small-to-date babies has been shown to be linked to serious medical problems later in life, including hypertension. This finding presents the pediatrician with a new role in the traditional vocation of preventing diseases. Mutations in several genes may be responsible for most cases of congenital or inherited kidney abnormalities. Two renal disorders, congenital nephrotic syndrome and neonatal acute renal failure, and one form of neonatal treatment modality, renal replacement therapy, are discussed in detail. These conditions are rare in general pediatric practice but illustrate some of the new developments in renal care of the newborn. A warning is given about the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during pregnancy and the neonatal period. All non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs administered indirectly to the fetus and directly to the young newborn harm kidney (fetus) structure and function (both the fetus and the newborn). The new data have been obtained with genetic and molecular biology techniques and with established methods of renal developmental physiology. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of neonatal kidney disorders will result in new diagnostic procedures and better preventive and therapeutic possibilities relevant to the newborn with a kidney disorder.",0,0

However, to date, no antiangiogenic agent is widely available for the clinical setting. Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are commonly used as antihypertensive agents and have recently been suggested to reduce cancer risk. Studies have found that an ACE inhibitor, perindopril, is a potent inhibitor of experimental tumor growth and angiogenesis at a clinically comparable dose. The potent angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is significantly suppressed by perindopril and also inhibits VEGF-induced tumor growth. In vitro studies showed that perindopril is not cytotoxic to tumor cells or endothelial cells.

After a 4-week placebo washout period, patients were randomized to perindopril 4 mg once daily (n = 42) or losartan 50 mg once daily (n = 43) for 12 weeks based on a double-blind parallel group design. At the end of the placebo and active treatment periods, BP was measured and plasma PAI-1 and fibrinogen were assessed; Both perindopril and losartan reduced systolic and diastolic BP values (-16/15 mm Hg and -15/14, respectively; p < 0.001 vs. placebo), with no differences between the two treatments. Plasma PAI-1 was reduced with perindopril (-10 ng/dl, p = 0.028 vs. placebo) but not with losartan (+4 ng/dl, NS), the difference between both treatments being statistically significant (p < 0, 01). Plasma fibrinogen did not show significant changes with both drugs, although a decreasing trend was observed with perindopril.; These findings indicate that perindopril, but not losartan, lowers PAI-1 in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, suggesting that the lowering effect of PAI-1 is not related to AT receptor blockade and could be due to the fact that the endothelial receptors that mediate PAI -1 expression in response to angiotensin II are not subtypes of type 1 receptors.

963,12002704,ACE inhibition is superior to angiotensin receptor blockade for renography in renal artery stenosis.,,"Karanikas, Georgios; Becherer, Alexander; Wiesner, Karoline; Dudczak, Robert; Kletter, Kurt","Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, as well as angiotensin II receptor antagonists, can prevent the vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin II on renal efferent vessels, which is thought to play an important role in renovascular hypertension. . This effect is presumed to be essential for the demonstration of renovascular hypertension by captopril renography. In this study, the renographic changes induced by captopril and the AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan were compared in patients with a high probability of renovascular hypertension. Twenty-five patients with 33 stenosed renal arteries (degree of stenosis >50%) and hypertension were studied. Captopril, valsartan, and baseline renography were performed within 48 h using technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine. Blood pressure was controlled, plasma renin concentration was determined before and after the intervention, and urine flow was estimated from diuresis in hydrated patients. Changes in renographic curves after the intervention were evaluated according to the Santa Fe consensus on renography with ACE inhibitors. Captopril renography was positive, indicating renovascular hypertension, in 25 of 33 stenosed vessels, whereas valsartan renography was positive in only 10. Blood pressure during renography with captopril and valsartan was not different; blood pressure reduction was the same after valsartan and captopril. Plasma renin concentration was comparable for the valsartan and captopril studies, showing suppressed values post-intervention in up to 12 of 25 patients. Urinary flow after valsartan was higher than after captopril (P<0.05). However, this difference could not explain the markedly higher sensitivity of captopril compared with valsartan in demonstrating renal artery stenosis. In 14 of the 25 patients, blood pressure response to revascularization was monitored, showing a much better predictive value for captopril renography. We conclude that captopril renography is much more sensitive than valsartan renography in detecting clinically significant renal artery stenosis. Furthermore, our data suggest that other effects, such as that of the prostaglandin-bradykinin system, are of at least similar importance to ACE inhibition for the high diagnostic sensitivity of captopril renography with respect to renovascular hypertension.",0,0

The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial was designed to determine whether the addition of valsartan improved outcomes in patients receiving standard therapy for heart failure, which in most cases included an ACE inhibitor; A total of 5,010 patients with NYHA class II-IV CHF and ejection fraction <40% were assigned to receive valsartan 160 mg or placebo twice daily. The 2 co-primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and combined mortality and morbidity, defined as the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure, sudden death with resuscitation, or intravenous treatment with inotropes or vasodilators for at least 4 hours (hospitalizations account for 94% of nonfatal endpoints). Mortality was similar in the 2 groups, but the combined mortality and morbidity endpoint was 13.2% lower with valsartan (relative risk, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0. 97; P009), mainly due to a reduction in the number of patients hospitalized for CHF (13.8% vs. 18.2%). There were improvements in several secondary endpoints, including ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and quality of life with valsartan. Of note, analyzes of subgroups defined according to background therapy at baseline showed highly significant interactions. For example, the small subgroup of 366 patients (7%) not receiving ACE inhibitors had a 33% reduction in mortality and a 44% reduction in mortality and morbidity, whereas the benefit of valsartan in Morbidity and mortality observed in the overall trial was no longer significant in patients receiving background therapy with an ACE inhibitor (relative risk, 0.90; P.10). The largest subgroup of patients who received an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker at baseline had a statistically significant 42% increase in mortality with valsartan (p.009) and a trend toward an increase in composite mortality and morbidity (p.10) .; When added to standard therapy, valsartan has no overall effect on mortality and produces a modest (13.2%) reduction in morbidity and mortality.

Key search terms included cough, bronchospasm, asthma, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers; The literature reports several cases of increased bronchial responsiveness associated with ACE inhibitors. Larger controlled studies evaluating the increased risk in patients with pulmonary dysfunction are limited. Data from these trials are summarized in this article.; The literature shows that patients with primary airway diseases, such as asthma and COPD, are not at increased risk of developing cough or bronchoconstriction as a result of ACE inhibitor therapy. Despite the ability of ACE inhibitors to improve exercise tolerance, perfusion, and gas transfer, patients with CHF may be at higher risk of developing cough than the general population. Whether this cough is attributed to ACE inhibition or increased left ventricular dysfunction is not yet known. If increased bronchial responsiveness occurs, angiotensin II receptor antagonists are another reasonable option.",0,0

In this study we investigate the influence of these recommendations by comparing the management of hypertension in acute stroke in a tertiary care hospital with current guidelines; Retrospective chart review of patients admitted with acute stroke to Ottawa Hospital General Campus for six consecutive months. The use of antihypertensive medications (type, dose, routes of administration, BP records) was recorded in the first seven days after admission; Transdermal nitroglycerin paste was the most widely used antihypertensive agent. In contrast to the 15% reduction in BP in 24 hours recommended for lowering BP in hypertensive patients with ischemic stroke, nitroglycerin caused >15% reduction in BP in the first 24 hours on 60% of the occasions used. . Furthermore, despite concerns about sublingual nifedipine, this was the second most frequently prescribed agent. Surprisingly, the mean time to first BP measurement after initiation of antihypertensive therapy was 117 +/- 43 minutes in ischemic stroke and 88 +/- 89 minutes in hemorrhagic stroke; Current guidelines for the management of acute post-stroke hypertension appear to have little influence on prescribing patterns, leading to considerable variation in practice. Such variations, probably due to uncertainty caused by lack of evidence from randomized controlled trials, are intolerable as patients may be subjected to non-standardized and potentially harmful care, such as inappropriate choice of antihypertensives and inadequate BP control, such as was observed in this study.",0,0

The following cost modules were evaluated: general medicine ward, intensive care unit (both staff costs only), and reperfusion therapy. The following process quality indicators were evaluated: reperfusion therapy; and prescription of aspirin, lidocaine, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors; Switzerland, Germany, and France had the highest reperfusion costs due to a relatively high percentage of patients receiving percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, stents, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers. Staff costs for general medicine wards and intensive care units were higher in Italy and Germany due to relatively long hospital stays. Average quality ratings ranged from 89% in the UK and France to 96% in Germany; There was little variation in the quality of care process for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.

This study evaluated the clinical effects of discontinuing omapatrilat after a patient's hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) was controlled on omapatrilat for at least 6 months, with or without adjuvant antihypertensive medications. This double-blind study randomized 83 patients to receive their established dose of omapatrilat or placebo for 8 weeks; any concomitant antihypertensive medication was held constant. Patients who continued on omapatrilat had no changes in blood pressure. Patients whose chronic treatment with omapatrilat was replaced by placebo had clinically important increases in both systolic (+16.5 mm Hg) and diastolic (+9.6 mm Hg) blood pressure (both p<0.001).

ALLHAT was a large, simple trial designed to closely mimic clinical practice as it occurs in high-risk hypertensive patients aged 55 years and older. Their objectives were to determine whether the incidence of the primary outcome (a combination of fatal coronary heart disease and non-fatal myocardial infarction) differed between treatment with a diuretic (chlorthalidone) (12.5-25.0 mg/day) and treatment with each of three other types of antihypertensive drugs: a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril), and a peripheral alpha-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin) (2-8 mg/day ). Doxazosin was recently withdrawn from this trial after an interim analysis showed that the secondary endpoint of combined cardiovascular disease was 25% higher in patients treated with doxazosin than those assigned to chlorthalidone treatment. This finding was largely driven by congestive heart failure. The practicing physician should not completely abandon doxazosin because of the ALLHAT findings, although these findings are indisputably important. These results represent an interim analysis and their application to clinical practice should be done with care. A valuable member of our therapeutic arsenal does not need to be completely buried; rather, doxazosin should now be viewed as a secondary or tertiary antihypertensive therapy pending a more complete review of the ALLHAT data.",0,0

986,12062731,The liver and lovastatin.,,"Tolman, Keith G","Cholesterol-lowering agents, known as statins, have been used for 15 years and are among the most commonly prescribed drugs. Animal studies and premarketing clinical trials have shown evidence of hepatotoxicity, primarily minor elevations in serum levels of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT). For that reason, all cholesterol-lowering drugs have labels that require liver enzyme monitoring. However, post-marketing experience suggests that hepatotoxicity is rare and it is therefore timely to revisit the topic. The first of the statins, lovastatin, was approved in 1986 and has gained 24 million patient-years of clinical experience. Minor liver enzyme elevations, ie, ALT 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), occur in 2.6% and 5.0% of patients receiving lovastatin doses of 20 and 80 mg/day , respectively. These elevations are reversible with continued therapy, are dose-related, and are likely related to cholesterol reduction per se. Rare cases of acute liver failure (ALF) have been reported with all cholesterol-lowering medications. With lovastatin, the rate is approximately 1/1.14 million patient-treatments per year, which is 9% of the rate of a history of all-cause ALF and approximately equal to the rate of a history of idiopathic ALF. Surveillance for hepatotoxicity has not been effective in preventing severe liver disease, largely due to its rarity and poor predictive value for minor ALT elevations. In fact, it may increase patient risk due to unnecessary interruption of cholesterol-lowering therapy due to false-positive results in patients who benefit from treatment.",0,0

In addition, the effect of these drugs on blood pressure, heart rate, renal functions, and serum electrolytes, and their efficacy and tolerability in combination with digoxin, were studied. This study was carried out at the Department of Medicine, Alexandria Main University Hospital, Alexandria, Egypt, during the period May 1999 to May 2000; Diltiazem caused a significant increase in the maximum serum concentration of digoxin without significant changes in the time to reach the maximum concentration and the apparent volume of distribution. The total clearance of digoxin was significantly reduced and the elimination half-life was prolonged. Subsequently, the area under the time-concentration curve and steady-state digoxin level increased, but were still within the therapeutic range. On the other hand, isosorbide dinitrate significantly increased the maximum serum concentration of digoxin, but without changes in the other pharmacokinetic parameters of digoxin. Isosorbide dinitrate, but not diltiazem, caused a significant reduction in supine and standing blood pressure, whereas both drugs did not significantly alter pulse rate, renal function, serum potassium, and electrocardiographic pattern; Patients receiving diltiazem showed a mean 51% increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, a 50% increase in the mean steady-state serum digoxin concentration, and a 37% increase in the maximum serum concentration of digoxin. of digoxin.

The antihypertensive response to either drug was accompanied by a similar sustained inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. Plasma levels of angiotensin I (Ang I), angiotensin II (Ang II), and Ang-(1-7) were not altered by treatment with omapatrilat or lisinopril, although both regimens produced a modest increase in renin activity. plasma. In contrast, urinary excretion rates of Ang I and Ang-(1-7), but not Ang II, were significantly increased during the dosing period of subjects receiving omapatrilat, whereas the lower antihypertensive response produced by lisinopril had a minor and transient effect on dose escalation. urinary excretion rates of Ang-(1-7). Omapatrilat, being a single molecule that inhibits neutral endopeptidase and converting enzyme simultaneously, controlled salt-sensitive hypertension through a mechanism that was associated with sustained increases in urinary Ang-(1-7) excretion.

Identification of individuals at risk for this adverse effect is not possible. Angioedema is associated with elevated levels of bradykinin, which is primarily inactivated by ACE. We evaluated the plasma activity of two other enzymes that catabolize bradykinin (aminopeptidase P and carboxypeptidase N) in 39 hypertensive patients with a history of angioedema during treatment with ACE inhibitors and in 39 hypertensive patients who had never had inhibitor-associated side effects. of the ACE. Patients with previous angioedema had lower plasma aminopeptidase P activity than those who had never had angioedema (p=0.003). Our data suggest that low plasma concentrations of aminopeptidase P could be a predisposing factor for the development of angioedema in patients treated with ACE inhibitors.",0,0

Of these patients, 411 (68%) received concordant care and 191 (32%) discordant care. Positive predictors of discordant attention presentation were age >65 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% CI, 1.7-3.6), silent infarction (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, %, 1.6-4.6), anterior infarction (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.7-3.8), history of heart failure (OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 3, 7-10.7), chronic atrial fibrillation (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.5-6.4); and heart rate >/= 100 beats/min (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4-3.1).

A prospective, randomized, 7-year study was conducted to examine the effect of tight (<120/80 mmHg) versus standard (135-140/85-90 mmHg) BP control on left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and renal function in 75 hypertensive ADPKD patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. LVMI was measured by echocardiogram at the start of the study and at 1 and 7 years. Renal function was assessed by measuring serum creatinine and 24-h creatinine clearance every 6 months for 3 years, then annually for an additional 4 years. Baseline characteristics were comparable in the two groups. During the study, mean mean arterial pressure was 90 +/- 5 mmHg for the rigorous group and 101 +/- 4 mmHg for the standard group (P < 0.0001). LVMI decreased by 21% in the standard group and 35% in the rigorous group. A mixed-model longitudinal data analysis revealed that tight BP control was significantly more effective in reducing LVMI (P < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in renal function between the two groups. In conclusion, left ventricular hypertrophy, an important cardiovascular risk factor, was reduced to a significantly greater degree by rigorous standard BP control. This finding is of particular clinical importance because cardiovascular complications are the most common cause of death in patients with ADPKD.",0,0

Patients younger than 70 years with systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or = 100 mm Hg were eligible for the study. C administration was started during the first 4 days of AMI (mean 21 +/- 24 h). Finally, 50 pts treated with C and a control group of 43 pts were analyzed. C doses were gradually increased from 3,125 mg tid on the first day to 25 mg tid on the 4th day. A significant decrease in SBP was observed after C administration at 60 and 120 min after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd doses on the first day, and after 30-120 min after the first dose of C on the 4th day. The dBP decreased only at 60-120 minutes after the first dose on the first day and at 90 minutes after the first dose on the fourth day. Hypotension after the 1st and 2nd doses of C on the first day caused 3 pts (6%) to be excluded from the study. In conclusion, hypotension seems to be found quite frequently during captopril treatment in the initial phase of AMI. It appears not only after the first but also after the following doses. The initial dose of 3,125 mg seems safe and sufficient to evaluate its hypotensive action.",0,0

1011,12109041,From toxic precursors to safe drugs. Mechanisms and relevance of idiosyncratic drug reactions.,,"Petersen, Karl-Uwe","In adverse drug reactions, the effects explained by the pharmacological profile of the drug can be distinguished from sometimes strange and unpredictable events (""idiosyncrasies""). In most cases, the latter are due to reactive intermediates formed by members of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These products are normally formed in very low amounts. However, genetic disposition (eg, from increased expression of the catalytic enzyme or failure of protective factors such as glutathione) or certain external conditions (eg, co-medication from inducers of drug metabolism) can lead to the availability of toxic intermediates in relevant quantities. Once generated, these metabolites will react with macromolecules and ultimately cause cell necrosis. Necrosis may result from direct damage to essential cell functions or be secondary to damaging immune reactions triggered by recognition of new structures such as neoantigens. As the major site of drug metabolism, the liver is most frequently affected by idiosyncratic reactions, which are often recognized only after large numbers of patients have been treated. The idiosyncratic potential of a drug is related to its chemical structure rather than its pharmacological mechanism. The risks are evident if the biotransformation generates products with chemical substructures such as quinones, phenols, acyl halides, aromatic and hydroxylated amines. There are numerous cases of precursor drugs with idiosyncratic potential that have been replaced or marginalized by agents with more favorable chemical properties. Examples include beta 1 preferential beta-adrenergic antagonists (toxic precursor: practolol) and choline esterase inhibitors used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In the latter group, tacrine (CAS 321-64-2) leads to elevated liver enzyme levels in approximately 30% of patients, an effect not shared with newer chemically different entities. A similar case can be made for the insulin sensitizer troglitazone (CAS 97322-87-7) (marketed, now withdrawn in the US) and its successors rosiglitazone (CAS 122320-73-4) and pioglitazone (CAS 111025- 46-8). Due to its different chemical structure, only troglitazone can be transformed into a reactive quinone metabolite, a process that can be accelerated by the drug inducing its own metabolism. In accordance with this view, there is no evidence of liver-specific toxicity with the two successor drugs. Continued progress in molecular toxicology can help minimize idiosyncratic hazards that are already in the early stages of drug development.",0,0

Patients were simultaneously monitored under ambulatory conditions with 24-hour Holter monitoring, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and 24-hour fractional urine collection. Heart rate variability was assessed using four different methods; ambulatory HRV analysis was performed by spectral and time-domain analysis, and short-term spectral analysis and bedside testing were performed on research days; Metoprolol treatment improved vagal tone assessed by short-term spectral analysis. 24-hour ambulatory HRV analysis showed improvement in some parameters reflecting vagal function. A minor decrease in diurnal diastolic blood pressure was shown, no alterations were observed in the diurnal variation of blood pressure or in the excretion of albumin in the urine; These preliminary findings indicate that beta-blocker treatment might improve autonomic function in type I diabetic patients with abnormal albuminuria and an associated high risk of cardiovascular disease.",0,0
1021,12140805,The prognostic significance of different definitions of worsening renal function in congestive heart failure.,,"Gottlieb, Stephen S; Abraham, William; Butler, Javed; Forman, Daniel E; Loh, Evan; Massie, Barry M; O'connor, Christopher M; Rich, Michael W; Stevenson, Lynne Warner; Young, James; Krumholz, Harlan M","Worsening kidney function in patients hospitalized for heart failure portends a poor prognosis. However, the criteria used to define worsening renal function are arbitrary and the implications of the different definitions remain unclear. Therefore, we compared the prognostic significance of various definitions of worsening renal function in 1,002 patients hospitalized for congestive heart failure (CHF); The patient population was 49% female, aged 67 +/- 15 years. Twenty-three percent had a history of kidney failure, 73% had depressed ejection fraction, and 63% had CHF. At hospital admission, 47% were receiving ACE inhibitors, 22% beta-blockers, 70% diuretics, and 6% NAIDs. 72% developed an increase in serum creatinine during hospitalization, and 20% developed an increase of > or = 0.5 mg/dl. Worsening renal function predicted both in-hospital mortality and length of stay >10 days. Even a 0.1 mg/dL increase in creatinine was associated with a worse outcome. Sensitivity for death decreased from 92% to 65% as the threshold for creatinine rise was raised from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/dL, and specificity increased from 28% to 81%. At a threshold increase of 0.3 mg/dl, the sensitivity was 81% and the specificity 62% for death and 64% and 65% for hospital stay >10 days. Adding a final creatinine requirement of > or = 1.5 mg/dL improved specificity; This analysis demonstrates that any detectable decrease in kidney function is associated with increased mortality and prolonged hospital stay. This suggests that therapeutic interventions that improve kidney function might be beneficial.",0,0

Patients were treated in 659 hospitals, 22 of which had also participated in SAVE. One-third of patients were enrolled after the publication of SAVE in 1992. The primary outcome was use of an ACE inhibitor at discharge. We analyzed the data using hierarchical models and multivariate regression.; Patients treated at sites that had participated in SAVE were no more likely to receive an ACE inhibitor at discharge than patients treated at non-SAVE sites (226/1,415 [16%] vs 3,671/24,471 [15%]; odds ratio (OR) = 1.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 1.4, P = 0.67). Although patients with heart failure were more likely to receive ACE inhibitors than those without heart failure, there was no difference between SAVE and non-SAVE sites (90/297 [30%] vs. 1,322/4,405 [30%]; P = 0.75). ACE inhibitor use increased after the publication of the SAVE trial, but again there was no significant difference in drug uptake between SAVE and non-SAVE sites; Sites that had participated in SAVE were no more likely to adopt ACE inhibitors for patients with myocardial infarction than sites that had not participated. If those who generated the evidence are slow to translate it into practice, it is unlikely that passive forms of dissemination can improve the quality of care. To accelerate the adoption of new evidence, we need to understand factors other than knowledge and awareness that influence practice.",0,0

The authors studied 89 Hispanic hypertensive patients from the Caribbean who participated in six double-blind randomized trials of antihypertensive agents. Demographic, laboratory, sodium excretion, plasma renin activity, and atrial natriuretic peptide data were obtained after 3 to 4 weeks on placebo. Blood pressure responses to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and fixed combinations of ACE inhibitors and HCTZ were compared with placebo values after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment. The patients had a profile of multiple risk factors (obesity and diabetes) and a broad spectrum of elevated blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hypertensive kidney damage. Urinary sodium excretion rates indicated inability to comply with salt restriction in 65% of patients. Plasma renin activity was lower than that of Hispanic normotensive controls, and 62% of patients had low-renin essential hypertension based on the renin profile for sodium excretion. On analysis of variance, blood pressure reductions for calcium channel blockers, HCTZ, and ACE inhibitor/HCTZ combinations were significantly greater than for placebo, while those for ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers as monotherapy were not. The authors conclude that essential hypertension in Caribbean Hispanics is associated with multiple risk factors and is largely of the low-renin type. Responses to therapy are consistent with those observed in other populations with a low-renin phenotype and suggest salt sensitivity in blood pressure in this population. Confirmation of the latter has implications for the prevention and treatment of essential hypertension in Hispanics.",0,0

In a randomized trial, we recruited 32 untreated patients (19 men, aged 59 years or older) with hypertension, who received enalapril (mean dose 17 mg/day) or losartan (mean dose 77 mg/day) at doses equipotent. . Enalapril decreased plasma levels of all cAMs after 8 weeks of treatment: cE-selectin levels decreased by 13% (P = 0.007), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (cICAM-1) by 15% (P = 0.002) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (cVCAM-1) by 19% (P=0.003). Similarly, enalapril decreased plasma levels of MCP-1 by 13% (P<0.001). Losartan did not significantly change plasma concentrations of cAM or MCP-1 after 8 weeks of treatment: cE-selectin levels decreased by 3%, cICAM-1 by 5%, cVCAM-1 by 8%, while MCP-1 increased 2% (all P=NS; not significant). The effect of enalapril on cVCAM-1 percent changes was significantly different from that of losartan (P = 0.0429). Eight weeks of antihypertensive treatment with enalapril but not losartan significantly decreased plasma levels of cAM and MCP-1 in hypertensive patients. The beneficial effects of ACE-I on cAMs may have implications for atherogenesis and reduction of cardiovascular events, which cannot be fully explained by their antihypertensive effects alone.",0,0

Ramipril lowered resting TAT and tended to lower fibrinogen; Factor VII remained unchanged. Mental stress increased fibrinogen but did not alter TAT or Factor VII activity. The reduced generation of thrombin in patients taking ramipril may partly explain why ACE inhibitors reduce thromboembolic complications in patients with cardiovascular disease.",0,0

Power spectral analyzes (short recordings) and norepinephrine measurements were also performed in the supine position and after a postural challenge (60-degree head-up tilt test: HUT). Low-dose combination therapy induced the greatest reduction in the LF component and the LF/HF ratio, both in the resting and reclined positions, as well as in blood pressure. However, the physiological autonomic response to HUT was maintained. Plasma norepinephrine levels were lower after combination therapy than after either drug alone. Our data demonstrate that in uncomplicated, mild essential hypertension, chronic low-dose combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and an AT(1) antagonist is more effective than recommended full-dose monotherapy with either drug in influencing in the autonomic regulation of the heart, which suggests a relative reduction in the sympathetic drive both at the cardiac and systemic levels.",0,0
1029,12152252,[The effect of aspirin on the rheological properties of erythrocytes in essential hypertension].,,"Korbut, Renata A; Adamek-Guzik, Teresa","Essential hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Its pathophysiological mechanism is unknown. Recent data suggest that red blood cell deformability and aggregation may play an important role in the regulation of blood rheology in hypertension. Simultaneously, there are reports suggesting that the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors might be counteracted by high-dose aspirin. We postulate that these effects could be related to changes in blood rheology. Consequently, we designed a study to evaluate the effect of low or high doses of aspirin on the deformability and aggregability of red blood cells from patients with essential hypertension. Red blood cell deformability and aggregability were measured using a laser diffractometer (Rheodyn SSD, Myrenne GmbH) and a computerized automatic aggregometer (MA1 Myrenne GmbH, Germany), respectively. The effects of aspirin on red blood cell deformability and aggregation were studied ex vivo in whole blood from three groups of patients with essential hypertension (group I: 10 patients who received placebo, group II: 23 patients who received 75 mg/day). aspirin orally for 3 days, and group III: 23 patients who received aspirin 300 mg/day orally for 3 days). Subjects in all groups received the same combination of antihypertensive agents consisting of: an ACE inhibitor (enalapril or perindopril), a beta-antagonist (metoprolol or bisoprolol), and a diuretic agent (indapamid). In patients receiving high-dose aspirin (300 mg/day), we observed that erythrocyte aggregability was 25% higher than in the placebo group (MEA = 25.8 +/- 6 SD, vs MEA = 20.6 + /- 3 SD, p < 0.05). Aspirin had no effect on erythrocyte deformability or arterial blood pressure. High doses of aspirin or possibly also other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients receiving antihypertensive therapy may directly affect the rheological properties of blood due to activation of red blood cell aggregation. Increased red blood cell aggregation during antihypertensive therapy may be an important indicator of worsening organ perfusion.",0,0

This study was prospectively conducted in 110 hypertensive children aged 6 to 16 years in two sequential phases. The primary outcome variable for both phases of the study was sitting diastolic blood pressure (24 hours post-dose). The primary objective of the first phase of the study was to determine whether enalapril lowered blood pressure in children in a dose-dependent manner. During a 2-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response period, patients were stratified by weight (< 50 kg or > or = 50 kg), then assigned to one of three dosage groups: low (0.625 or 1.25 mg), medium (2.5 or 5 mg), or high dose (20 or 40 mg). Blood pressure reduction was examined as a dose ratio (1:4:32) and adjusted for weight. At the end of the dose-response phase of the study, patients entered a 2-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal to receive enalapril or placebo. Antihypertensive efficacy, defined as the difference in sitting diastolic blood pressure between the placebo and enalapril groups, was determined. Adverse events were carefully recorded throughout the study. The dose-response relationship for enalapril was negatively sloped and linear over the chosen dosage range, suggesting that higher doses of enalapril were associated with greater blood pressure reduction. Random withdrawal to active drug or placebo confirmed the antihypertensive efficacy of enalapril in the medium- and high-dose groups. The antihypertensive effect of enalapril was maintained across age, gender, race, and Tanner stage. Enalapril appears to be an effective and generally well-tolerated antihypertensive agent in children 6 to 16 years of age. An initial dose of 2.5 mg in children weighing < 50 kg and 5 mg in children weighing > 50 kg (mean = 0.08 mg/kg) given once daily effectively reduced blood pressure within 2 weeks in the most patients.

Reduction in proteinuria was associated with a significant (>50%) reduction in nonselective glomerular membrane shunting, but was not correlated with concomitant changes in blood pressure and renal hemodynamics, nor was it influenced by duration of treatment. . The reduction in UPE and sieving coefficient of the largest neutral dextrans exceeded by two-fold the reduction achieved by conventional doses of ACEi in historical controls with similar renal dysfunction and proteinuria, previously studied under identical experimental conditions. Indomethacin did not influence the renal effects of the maximum doses of ramipril and was stopped prematurely in six patients due to reversible side effects. Serum potassium increased significantly only in combination with indomethacin and never required treatment discontinuation; Increasing the titration to maximum tolerated doses safely increases the antiproteinuric effect of ACEs and may serve to achieve maximal long-term renoprotection. The combination with indomethacin is poorly tolerated and ineffective. Innovative approaches are needed to use ACEi more effectively.",0,0

However, due to the potential adverse effects of thyroid hormone, there has been interest in developing analogs with fewer undesirable side effects. Screening for compounds structurally related to levothyroxine identified 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) as an analog with inotropic selectivity and low metabolic activity in hypothyroid rats. When DITPA was administered alone or in combination with captopril in rat and rabbit models of postinfarction heart failure, it increased cardiac output and decreased left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LV EDP) without increasing heart rate. A pilot clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DITPA. In a dose-ranging study in 7 normal volunteers, the drug was well tolerated. A double-blind comparison of DITPA versus placebo was then performed in a group of 19 patients with moderately severe heart failure. Patients were randomly assigned to receive DITPA 1,875 mg/kg or placebo daily. After 2 weeks, the drug was increased to 3.75 mg/kg daily for an additional 2 weeks.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (AIIR) have been shown to have a protective effect on the progression of diabetic nephropathy and have therefore become the first option for the treatment of hypertension and/or renal involvement in patients with diabetes. However, most of these patients, especially those with type 2 diabetes, require two or more medications to reduce their blood pressure to the levels proposed in recently published consensus documents. These target blood pressure levels are 130/80 mm Hg in diabetic subjects with proteinuria up to 1 g/day and 125/75 mm Hg in those with proteinuria greater than 1 g/day. Combinations of different drugs can have a synergistic effect. Some of the first studies using a combination of nondihydropyridine or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with ACE-I demonstrated a synergistic effect on proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, these studies have not been substantiated, but calcium channel blockers, with their proven ability to lower blood pressure, play an important role in the treatment of patients with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension. The combination of ACE-I with AIIR may have several theoretical advantages. Many studies have been done with this combination in animal models of diabetes and in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease. Some of these studies have shown a synergistic effect of the combination on proteinuria or hypertension, but the results have not been consistent across studies. It can be concluded that, until further studies provide more convincing evidence, this combination could be used in patients whose proteinuria or hypertension did not respond to either agent as monotherapy or to a combination of other drugs.",0,0

Enrollment began in April 1997 and follow-up ended in April 2001; A total of 369 patients with MDD (64% male; mean age, 57.1 years; 17-item Hamilton Depression [HAM-D] mean score, 19.6; MI, 74%; unstable angina, 26%) ; After a 2-week single-blind placebo trial, patients were randomized to receive sertraline in flexible doses of 50 to 200 mg/day (n = 186) or placebo (n = 183) for 24 weeks; The primary (safety) outcome measure was change from baseline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); Secondary measures included surrogate cardiac measures and cardiovascular adverse events, as well as scores on the HAM-D scale and the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement (CGI-I) scale in the total randomized sample, in a group with any prior history of MDD, and in a more severe MDD subgroup defined a priori by a HAM-D score of at least 18 and a history of 2 or more previous episodes of MDD; Sertraline had no significant effect on mean (SD) LVEF (sertraline: baseline, 54% [10%]; week 16, 54% [11%]; placebo: baseline, 52% [13%]; week 16, 53% [13%]), treatment-emergent increase in ventricular premature complex (VPC) strokes (sertraline: 13.1%; placebo: 12.9%), QTc interval greater than 450 milliseconds at endpoint (sertraline : 12%; placebo: 13%), or other cardiac measures. All comparisons were not statistically significant (P > or = 0.05). The incidence of serious cardiovascular adverse events was 14.5% with sertraline and 22.4% with placebo. In the total random sample, the CGI-I (P = 0.049), but not the HAM-D (P = 0.14), favored sertraline. CGI-I response rates for sertraline were significantly higher than for placebo in the overall sample (67% vs. 53%; P = .01), in the group with at least 1 prior episode of depression (72% vs. at 51%; P = .003) and in the more severe MDD group (78% vs. 45%; P = .001). In the latter two groups, CGI-I and HAM-D measures were significantly better in those assigned to sertraline; Our results suggest that sertraline is a safe and effective treatment for recurrent depression in patients with recent myocardial infarction or unstable angina and without other life-threatening medical conditions.",0,0

It is confirmed that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce urinary protein excretion (UPE) and attenuate the development of kidney damage. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are an alternative class of drugs that inhibit the activity of the renin-angiotensin system with preliminary confirmed renoprotective activity. However, data on the renoprotective action of very small doses of these drugs are lacking; Prospective, randomized, 3-month study of the effects of losartan 25 mg (n = 17) versus enalapril 10 mg (n = 17) versus the combination of losartan 25 mg and enalapril 10 mg (n = 15) on proteinuria renal function and metabolic profile in 51 patients with biopsy-proven chronic glomerulonephritis with normal or mildly decreased renal function [creatinine clearance (CRCL) between 36 and 93 mL/min]. Clinical evaluation and laboratory tests were estimated before treatment (baseline), during the first week and after 3 months of therapy; Both losartan and enalapril monotherapy significantly reduced proteinuria by 25.35% and 45.07%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the groups. Combination therapy induced a more marked reduction in proteinuria (65.96%) than either drug administered alone. This antiproteinuric effect was significantly more pronounced alone compared to the losartan group (p = 0.009). The decrease in blood pressure was more pronounced in the combined group. In all groups, no correlation was found between the drop in UPE and the reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure. A significant decrease in CRCL was observed with enalapril treatment just after 1 week of therapy (p = 0.039) and at the end of observation (p = 0.043). CRCL was stable in subjects treated with losartan. No changes in serum creatinine level, metabolic profile, and sodium excretion were observed during therapy in the groups studied; These results indicated that even very small doses of losartan and enalapril reduce proteinuria in patients with primary glomerulonephritis. The combination of these drugs could cause a significantly greater antiproteinuric effect than either agent alone. Losartan treatment, compared with enalapril, is likely to be associated with a lower risk of acute drop in glomerular filtration rate at the start of therapy.",0,0

Practice effects due to repeated neuropsychological testing were estimated from data collected simultaneously in normotensive participants; Antihypertensive treatments lowered blood pressure comparably and did not affect mood or anxiety. Small treatment effects were seen in four of the seven domains of cognitive performance.

A low-dose combination of perindopril (Per) and indapamide (Ind) has been shown to reduce SBP more than atenolol for the same reduction in DBP. However, the possible influence of gender on this finding has never been tested.; A database of five randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging studies was established to determine the optimal dose of the Per/Ind combination in hypertensive men and women. A total of 2,907 patients were treated with placebo or various combinations associating Per (2, 4, 8 mg) and Ind (0.625, 1.25, 2.5 mg); In the general population, there was a significant dose-response relationship (P < 0.001) when doubling the dose of Per 2/Ind 0.625 mg to Per 8/Ind 2.5 mg with a progressive fall in SBP, DBP and MAP . When men and women were analyzed by dose, SBP, DBP, and MAP (but not PP) decreased significantly more in women than in men up to Per 4 /Ind dose 1.25. Later, with higher doses, generating a slight but significant hypokalaemia, the finding was reversed, resulting in a gender interaction in the general population.; In hypertensive subjects, the low-dose combinations Por 2/Ind 0.625 and Por 4/Ind 1.25 are the most effective in reducing blood pressure and preventing hypokalaemia. This effect is more pronounced in women, in whom increased SBP and PP are predominant hemodynamic features.",0,0

Its beneficial effects on exercise capacity have been less convincing in large parallel group studies. The aim of this investigation was to explore the mechanisms involved in dose-related functional effects and to test the hypothesis that a high dose of lisinopril recommended in one trial would improve aerobic exercise capacity and cardiovascular function more than a low dose; Twelve patients with symptomatic heart failure completed a randomized double-blind crossover trial of lisinopril 5 mg once daily and 20 mg once daily for 24 weeks, crossing over doses at 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was aerobic exercise capacity and the secondary endpoints were maximal exercise cardiac output and dobutamine stimulation.; Aerobic exercise capacity (primary endpoint) was significantly higher during the 5 mg dose per day compared to the 20 mg dose (1696 vs. 1578 ml.min(-1), P=0.016), equivalent to a increase of 1.53 ml.kg(-1)min(-1) from 19.6 ml.kg(-1)min(-1) with 20 mg when normalized by body weight. Seventy-three percent of patients showed higher maximal oxygen consumption and maximal cardiac output at the 5 mg per day dose than at the 20 mg dose, and none showed the opposite. In terms of cardiac output, although the results were not statistically significant, there was a consistent pattern showing the same directional changes in favor of the lower dose in peak exercise cardiac power output and peak dobutamine cardiac power output. . There were no significant differences in resting values. A total of 24 adverse reactions were reported during the 5 mg phase compared to 38 during the 20 mg phase; Contrary to expectations, patients' aerobic exercise capacity was found to be greater with the lower dose of lisinopril, suggesting that ACE inhibitor therapy for heart failure may require tailoring doses to the individual to optimize functional benefits relative to putative prognostic benefits. .",0,0

Erectile dysfunction reduces quality of life and may affect compliance, impairing the success of congestive heart failure treatment; In the first phase (randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, fixed-dose, two-way crossover study), we studied the effects of 50 mg sildenafil on exercise and neurohormonal activation in 23 men with CHF. Patients underwent a 6-minute treadmill cardiopulmonary walk test (6'WT) followed by a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (ET).

We conducted this study to determine whether an increase in ACE inhibitor dose above maximal antihypertensive effect has additional antiproteinuric potential; Twenty-three proteinuric patients were administered the ACE inhibitor spirapril at an initial dose of 3 to 6 mg/d. The dose was increased every 6 weeks until maximal antihypertensive effect, as assessed by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABP) (spir(max)), was then increased to a supramaximal dose (spir(supramax) ). Renal parameters, urinary protein excretion, and systemic activity of the renin-angiotensin system were compared between baseline, spir(max), and spir(supramax). Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were determined before administration of spirapril and after administration of the supramaximal dose; Median PAA and proteinuria decreased significantly from baseline to expir(max) (median, 102 mm Hg; range, 82 to 122 mm Hg versus 97 mm Hg; range, 82 to 113 mm Hg; median protein, 2.56 g/d, range 1.05 to 22.1 g/d versus 1.73 g/d, range 0.42 to 4.7 g/d). Both the creatinine level and creatinine clearance remained unchanged. Suppression of angiotensin II formation led to a significant increase in renin and angiotensin I concentrations and a non-significant decrease in aldosterone levels. Increasing spirapril to a supramaximal dose had no additional effect on serum renin or angiotensin I levels or proteinuria. There was a further slight decrease in aldosterone levels and subsequently a significantly lower level than at baseline; Our results show that the antiproteinuric effect of spirapril is associated with its antihypertensive effect. Although high-dose ACE inhibitor therapy has no additional influence on proteinuria, a possible long-term beneficial effect cannot be ruled out.",0,0

We present the preplanned analysis of the effects of ramipril in women in the HOPE study. The study randomly assigned 2,480 women aged 55 years and older with vascular disease or diabetes and at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor and no known heart failure or low LV ejection fraction to receive ramipril (10 mg/day) or placebo. . The primary outcome was the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or CV death. The mean follow-up was 4.5 years.; Ramipril treatment resulted in reduced rates of the primary endpoint (11.3% vs. 14.9% in the placebo group; relative risk [RR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0 0.62 to 0.96, p = 0.019), fewer strokes (3.1% 4.8%, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.96, p = 0.029), and fewer deaths CV (4.2% vs 6.9%; RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.88, p = 0.0068). There were trends toward reduced rates of myocardial infarction, heart failure, and death from all causes. The beneficial effect of ramipril was similar in women and men; Ramipril treatment reduces CV risk in high-risk women without heart failure and with preserved LV systolic function.",1,0
1054,12204500,Increased myocardial blood flow in hypertensive heart disease by angiotensin antagonists: a comparison of lisinopril and losartan.,,"Akinboboye, Olakunle O; Chou, Ru-Ling; Bergmann, Steven R","The aim of this study was to compare myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) before and after long-term treatment with lisinopril and losartan in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH); Studies have suggested that treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) improves MPR in patients with hypertension by potentiating endogenous bradykinins. Because angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) lack a direct effect on bradykinins, we hypothesize that they may not improve MPR; We measured myocardial blood flow (MBF) before and after treatment by positron emission tomography in 17 patients (lisinopril: 9 patients, losartan: 8 patients) with hypertension and LVH at baseline and after coronary vasodilation with intravenous dipyridamole. . In addition, we measured hyperemic and resting blood flow in eight normotensive controls.; Post-treatment peak coronary blood flow and MPR in the lisinopril group were significantly increased compared to pre-treatment values (3.5 +/- 1.2 vs. 2.6 +/- 1.1 mL/min /g, p = 0.02, 3.7 +/- 1.1 vs. 2.4 +/- 1 mL/min/g, respectively, p = 0.002, respectively). Post-treatment hyperemic flow in lisinopril-treated patients was not significantly different from corresponding measurements in controls (3.5 +/- 1.2 vs. 3.9 +/- 1 mL/min/g, respectively, p = NS). In patients treated with losartan, there was no difference between MBF and MPR values before and after treatment; Myocardial perfusion reserve and peak coronary flow improved in asymptomatic patients with hypertension-induced LVH after long-term treatment with lisinopril but not losartan. Therefore, ACEIs, but not ARBs, might be effective in repairing coronary microangiopathy associated with hypertension-induced LVH.",0,0

Vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPIs) are ACE and neutral endopeptidase inhibitors and can increase natriuretic peptides, bradykinin, and perhaps endothelin-1 in patients with congestive heart failure. Patients (n = 107) with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association functional class II to III, with left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, and on ACE inhibitor therapy were randomized to receive IPV omapatrilat 40 mg/day or the ACE inhibitor lisinopril 20 mg/day. Neurohormone trough levels (24 hours after dosing) were assessed at baseline and at 12- and 24-week follow-up. C-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide (C-ANP) levels decreased with lisinopril (p = 0.035), but not with omapatrilat. In contrast, N-terminal ANP levels did not change, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels tended to decrease similarly in both groups. Endothelin-1 levels increased in both groups, the increase reaching statistical significance with omapatrilat (p = 0.008). Levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 tended to decrease, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 increased in both groups, with statistical significance only for interleukin-10 with omapatrilat therapy. Neither agent changed catecholamines or angiotensin II. Therefore, even at minimal levels, omapatrilate potentiates C-ANP more than lisinopril. Potentially important effects of omapatrilate on endothelin-1 and anti-inflammatory cytokines were identified, providing possible explanations for differences in clinical outcome.",0,0

If at least similar efficacy to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is demonstrated, angiotensin receptor blockers may replace them due to their superior tolerability. Our objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of valsartan and enalapril in patients with heart failure stabilized with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. We randomized 141 patients (mean age 68 years, 74% men) with stable mild/moderate heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction 0.45 or less to valsartan 160 mg once daily (n=70) or enalapril 10 mg twice daily (n=71) for 12 weeks. Changes in the 6-minute walk test (primary efficacy endpoint), patients' well-being, and left ventricular size and function did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Valsartan was significantly non-inferior to enalapril in change of walking test distance: least squared treatment difference +1.12 m (95% confidence interval -21.9 to 24.1), non-inferiority P<0.001. Left ventricular size (P<0.001) and function (P=0.048) were significantly improved only in the valsartan group. Fewer patients experienced adverse events in the valsartan group (50%) than in the enalapril group (63%), although not statistically significant.

Using retrospective claims data, ACE inhibitor use was quantified and daily doses were compared with an equivalent target enalapril dose of 20 mg. Patients in the cohort averaged 80 years of age, 84% were women, and 70% resided primarily in a nursing home. Only 37.8% received an ACE inhibitor. Users were younger than nonusers (t=2.00; p=0.046), but there was no gender difference (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 73, 2.6). ACE inhibitor users averaged eight prescriptions per year, providing approximately 257 days of medication (70% of the study period). The mean enalapril equivalent daily dose was 10.6 mg and only 22% received the target dose. Nursing home residents were less likely to receive an ACE inhibitor than outpatients (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34, 0.89), but just as likely to receive the doses desired (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.34, 4.9).

This multicenter, controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study is conducted to assess post-treatment left ventricular mass index (LVMI) variation using centralized monitoring of M-mode echocardiography measurements and dedicated software. for semi-automatic measurement. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, outpatient hypertensive patients aged ≥ 18 years, with LVH (LVMI > 120 and 100 g/m(2) for males and females, respectively), are randomized to receive once per day, plus 52 weeks, either Per/Ind or enalapril. According to blood pressure levels, the dose can be adjusted. In addition to clinical examinations, echocardiographic ECG, blood pressure, heart rate, and laboratory determinations are performed at screening, at baseline, after 24 weeks, and at the end of the study. The main outcome measure is the change from baseline in LVMI, which is considered the main measure of efficacy; changes in blood pressure and echo-Doppler parameters are secondary criteria. Two-tailed Student's t-test for independent samples will be used to differentiate treatment effects between groups with alpha = 5%, and the intergroup difference in LVMI variation will be analyzed with 90% power. A sample size of 500 patients is required, thus at least 550 patients need to be randomized, based on a 10% proportion of potentially non-evaluable patients.

Twenty-four nonsmoking postmenopausal women who received ENA 10 mg twice daily prior to the study were randomized to DRSP/E2 + ENA (n = 12) or placebo (P) + ENA (n = 12) for 14 days. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP, plasma renin activity, and serum aldosterone were determined at baseline and day 14; Compared with placebo, mean [SD] 24-hour BP in the DRSP/E2 + ENA group decreased significantly from baseline (139/80 mm Hg), systolic (-9 [51 mm Hg, P = .014), and diastolic (-5 [4] mm Hg, p = 0.007). Essentially no change from baseline (139/83 mm Hg) in systolic or diastolic 24-hour ambulatory BP was observed in the P + ENA group.

Using an evidence-based clinical guideline, we evaluate the care provided to patients with systolic heart failure.; We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 420 patients from 25 primary care practices in New York State who had received a diagnosis of heart failure. Chart documentation confirmed the diagnosis (n = 395). Patients with noncardiogenic volume overload or correctable valve disease (n = 338) were excluded. Performance profiles measured use of diagnostic tests, measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), patient education, and prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. For treatment recommendations, patients were classified according to LVEF status; Only 82% of the patients studied had a documented LVEF test result in their charts. Of these, 49% had an LVEF < or = 40%. ACE inhibitor use was higher among patients with low LVEF (91%) than among those with normal LVEF (62%). Among patients with systolic heart failure taking ACE inhibitors, 87% were on target doses. Adherence measures were low for laboratory evaluation and patient education criteria.; Heart failure with normal LVEF was as prevalent as systolic heart failure in these primary care practices. Performance profiles for physician prescriptions of ACE inhibitors exceeded those published in the literature. However, patients who did not have a documented LVEF measurement received lower quality care as measured by this disease-specific guideline. This underlines the importance of measuring LVEF.",0,0

A crossover study was conducted to determine whether ACE inhibition with perindopril (4 mg/day) for 4 weeks decreases serum ADMA concentration and plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) level (a marker of endothelial injury) in 11 patients with NIDDM. None of the patients was treated with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, and none had major diabetic complications. Before the protocol began, serum ADMA and plasma vWF were significantly higher in the 11 NIDDM patients, compared to 8 control subjects without diabetes. Perindopril did not affect blood pressure or glucose metabolism, but did significantly decrease serum ADMA and plasma vWF. These results suggest that endothelial injury associated with elevated ADMA may be present even in patients with uncomplicated NIDDM, and that increased ACE activity may be involved in such endothelial dysfunction.",0,0

However, there is a possibility that an open artery related to an infarction may benefit post-AMI healing.; Of 223 patients recruited with anterior Q-wave AMI, 66 with persistent isolated left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion were randomized to the following treatments: 1) medical therapy (closed-artery group; n = 34) or 2) late LAD intervention and stenting treatment + medical therapy (open-artery group; n = 32). The study was designed to compare left ventricular (LV) end-systolic volume between the two groups 12 months after AMI; Late intervention 26 +/- 18 days after AMI resulted in significantly greater LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes at 12 months than medical treatment alone (106.6 +/- 37.5 mL vs. 79.7 +/- - 34.4 ml, p < 0.01 and 162.0 +/- 51.4 ml vs. 130.1 +/- 46.1 ml, p < 0.01, respectively).

Correction of these factors leads to a reduction in the progression of plaque formation and associated arterial wall thickness. However, atheroma remains a focal disease that develops at characteristic sites within the arterial tree. These sites are typically found in areas of vessel branching or marked curvature, and correspond to regions of high tensile stress and low shear stress, leading to the hypothesis that local hemodynamic factors and vessel wall mechanics enhance the focal development of the atheroma. Current evaluation of vascular hemodynamics suffers from an inability to handle complex flow and does not allow accurate determination of locally varying flow and shear stress patterns. However, the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) flow simulation techniques to ultrasound and local pressure data allows for a comprehensive and non-invasive assessment of hemodynamic flow parameters. The Candesartan cilexetil and Atenolol Carotid Haemodynamic Endpoint Trial (CACHET) study compares the effects of two antihypertensive regimens, one based on beta blockers and the other on angiotensin receptor blockers, on carotid intima-media thickness. The collection of ultrasound and pressure data on each subject provides a unique opportunity to apply these data to the CFD model to study the effects of these antihypertensive regimens on local fluid dynamics. This will lead to a greater understanding of the relationship of these factors to atheroma formation and regression.",0,0

Patients were randomized and titrated to a target dose of losartan (50 mg once daily) or captopril (50 mg three times daily) as tolerated. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Analysis was by intention to treat.; There were 946 deaths during a mean follow-up of 2.7 (0.9) years: 499 (18%) in the losartan group and 447 (16%) in the captopril group (relative risk 1.13 [95% CI 0 .99-1.28], p =0.07). Results for secondary and tertiary endpoints were as follows: sudden cardiac death or resuscitated cardiac arrest 239 (9%) versus 203 (7%), 1.19 (0.98-1.43), p=0.07 and fatal or nonfatal reinfarction 384 (14%) versus 379 (14%), 1.03 (0.89-1.18), p=0.72.

Losartan was significantly better tolerated than captopril, with fewer patients discontinuing study medication (458 [17%] vs 624 [23%], 0.70 [0.62-0.79], p<0.0001); Given that we observed a nonsignificant difference in total mortality in favor of captopril, ACE inhibitors should remain the treatment of first choice in patients after complicated acute myocardial infarction. Losartan cannot generally be recommended in this population. However, it was better tolerated than captopril and was associated with significantly fewer discontinuations. Although the role of losartan in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibition is not clearly defined, it can be considered in such patients.",0,0

The number of mesangial and endothelial cells increased in the 50 diabetic patients at the start of the study compared to control subjects. There was no difference in the number of podocytes. Glomerular volume was increased in diabetic patients, but the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) surface area underlying podocytes did not differ between groups. AER correlated positively with mesangial cell number in microalbuminuric patients (r = 0.44, P = 0.012) and negatively with podocyte number in proteinuric patients (r = -0.48, P = 0.040). In all 16 placebo-treated patients, glomerular volume increased after 3 years due to matrix accumulation and increased GBM surface area.

Temporal and spectral parameters were compared in 8 examined subjects characteristic of dippers, in the diurnal (6 am-10 pm) and nocturnal (10 pm-6 am) time periods; The results obtained before treatment, as in the control group, showed nocturnal increases in RMSSD (p < 0.05), pNN50 (NS, p > 0.05), VLF, LF (p < 0.05) and mean HF values (NS) with decreased LF/HF ratio (p < 0.05). Similar trends in cardiac ANS activity were observed after 1 year of enalapril intake. A comparison of HRV the day before and one year after ACE inhibition showed the increase in parasympathetic system values reflecting the parameters: RMSSD, pNN50 (p = 0.01) and HF (NS) with a decrease of the LF/HF ratio (p < 0.01). The evaluation of the parameters of the nocturnal HRV showed the increase of the average value of the HF (p < 0.05), without other significant changes between the trials; After 1 year of ACE inhibitor administration, the only improvement in parasympathetic activity of the day was observed. Nocturnal vagal activity suggested as one of the essential factors in the development of hypertension remained unchanged in patients classified in the ""dippers"" hypertension group.",0,0

Large-scale randomized controlled trials have greatly contributed to our understanding of the treatment of life-threatening arrhythmias. There are many causes of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, occurring primarily in the setting of healed myocardial infarction. Available treatments for the management of ventricular arrhythmias include antiarrhythmic medications, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and catheter ablation. Each therapy offers unique advantages for selected patients with life-threatening arrhythmias. Because the goal of arrhythmia control is not only to provide the best individual therapy, but also to provide the best guarantee of symptomatic arrhythmia control, the use of combination therapy has become a standard treatment strategy for patients with arrhythmias. sustained ventricular This review will discuss the different modes of treatment available for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and their potential risks and benefits. The rationale for using hybrid or combination therapy will be presented. Finally, some of the best known primary and secondary prevention trials for the treatment of ventricular tachycardias will be reviewed.",0,0

There were 357 men and women enrolled in the trial with untreated sitting diastolic BP of 95 to 114 mm Hg and ambulatory daytime diastolic BP > or = 85 mm Hg. Patients were randomized to receive COER-verapamil hydrochloride every night (240 mg titrated to 360 mg), enalapril every morning (10 mg titrated to 20 mg), losartan every morning (50 mg titrated to 100 mg), or placebo. Morning assessments of BP, heart rate, and systolic BP product of heart rate were performed using 24-hour ambulatory recordings after 4 weeks (low dose) and 8 weeks (high dose) of therapy; Results were similar at weeks 4 and 8 for all treatment groups except that the magnitude of change was greater at week 8.

The hypotensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been shown to be, at least partially, mediated by NO. We conducted a crossover study within the patient with the aim of investigating the potential effect of NAC on the antihypertensive action of ACE inhibitors, through a NO-dependent mechanism. Eighteen hypertensive smokers (> 10 years of habit and > 10 cigarettes per day) (15 men and 3 women, aged 69 +/- 5 years) treated with ACE inhibitors (11 captopril and 7 enalapril) were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to two treatment arms. In one arm, patients (n = 10) initially received the addition of NAC (600 mg three times daily) to the ACEI regimen. In the other group (n = 8), the patients remained on ACE inhibitors alone. At 21 days, the therapeutic patterns were crossed. The first group received ACEI alone, and the second group received ACEI and NAC and completed another 21-day treatment period. We evaluated the effect of NAC in each patient through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), performed at the end of each therapeutic regimen. A significant decrease in 24-h systolic and diastolic blood pressure (24-h BP) and daytime BP (dtPA) was achieved with the combination of ACEi and NAC (ACEi + NAC) compared to the ACE-only period: 24 h BP = 146.1 +/- 4.2 vs 137 +/- 3.1 (p < 0.05) and 89.2 +/- 2.8 vs 83.5 +/- 3.7mmHg (p = 0, 01). DtBP: 149.7 +/- 5.6 vs 141 +/- 3.7 and 92.1 +/- 4 vs 86 +/- 3.2 (both, p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in nocturnal BP (PAnt). The NAC effect was not statistically different for the two ACEIs. In conclusion, the addition of NAC to an ACE inhibitor enhances its antihypertensive effect during 24h BP and dtB in hypertensive smokers. This effect may be mediated by an NO-dependent mechanism, probably through the protective effect of NAC on NO oxidation.",0,0

At baseline, pulse pressure and mean pressure were determined from six conventional blood pressure (BP) readings and 24-hour ambulatory recordings. Adjusting for significant covariates, we calculated mutually adjusted relative hazard ratios associated with 10 mm Hg increases in pulse pressure or mean pressure. In the placebo group, nocturnal and 24-hour pulse pressures consistently predicted total and cardiovascular mortality, all cardiovascular events, stroke, and cardiac events. Daytime pulse pressure predicted cardiovascular mortality, all cardiovascular endpoints, and stroke. Hazard ratios for 10 mm Hg increases in pulse pressure ranged from 1.25 to 1.68. Conventionally measured pulse pressure predicted only cardiovascular mortality with a hazard ratio of 1.35. In the active treatment group compared to placebo patients, the relationship between outcome and ambulatory pulse pressure was attenuated to a non-significant level. Mean pressure determined from conventional or ambulatory BP measurements was not associated with a worse prognosis.

The secondary objective was to monitor echocardiographic and hemodynamic endpoints; Post-transplant patients with a 24-hour PAA recording abnormality were recruited for this prospective randomized double-blind study beginning 2 to 3 months post-transplant. Patients were then evaluated at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after transplant; Lisinopril decreased BP and clinical BP, the latter from 134/85 to 126/82 mm Hg at 6 months (p = 0.01 vs placebo) and 121/79 mm Hg at 2 years (p = 0, 03 vs. placebo). Fewer patients in the lisinopril group required additional amlodipine to control BP (p = 0.01). Data on left ventricular (LV) mass are difficult to interpret because, coincidentally, in this small study, the lisinopril group had lower baseline values than placebo. However, in the lisinopril group, mean LV mass decreased by 10% (P = 0.02) and mass index by 13% (P = 0.01), while mean LV mass and index of the placebo did not change. LV end-diastolic diameter increased only in the placebo group (p = 0.008).

Angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist can reverse left ventricular fibrosis in patients with ESRD. Ultrasonography-integrated backscattering (ISI) of myocardial walls is directly related to morphometrically assessed collagen content in humans. In this study, 30 chronically hemodialyzed patients with hypertension were randomly assigned to receive antihypertensive therapy with losartan (n = 10), angiotensin II receptor antagonist type 1 (AT1-R), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (n = 10) or amlodipine calcium antagonist (n = 10).

We hypothesize that antihypertensive drugs have different influences on the pulse wave even though their effects on blood pressure are the same. We studied 30 untreated hypertensive patients, 28 to 55 years of age, who rotated through six 6-week periods of daily treatment with amlodipine 5 mg, doxazosin 4 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, bisoprolol 5 mg, bendrofluazide 2.5 mg, or placebo. The best drug was repeated at the end of the rotation. Blood pressure readings and radial pulse tonometry (by Sphygmocor) were performed at each visit, and blood was drawn to measure levels of atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). The Sphygmocor lead of the central aortic pulse wave was used to measure the transmission time of the reflected wave (T(R)) and the rate of increase (IA), which is the proportional increase in systolic pressure due to the wave. reflected. There was a dissociation between the effects of drugs on blood pressure and pulse wave analysis. Bisoprolol caused the largest drops in blood pressure and T(R), but was the only drug that increased AI. This paradoxical response to bisoprolol was associated with a 3-fold increase in plasma BNP levels. There was a smaller elevation of BNP in women compared to men, as described above, and this elevation was also associated with significantly higher AI values. Other drugs reduced AI, and this was associated with a significant decrease in BNP by amlodipine. In conclusion, antihypertensive drugs differ in their short-term effects on increased systolic pulse wave and BNP secretion from the heart, which is considered a sensitive measure of cardiomyocyte stress. These differences may help explain differences in cause-specific outcome in recent trials.",0,0

Two-dimensionally guided M-mode echocardiograms were performed at screening (recruitment scan), randomization (baseline scan), and after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment. Baseline and treatment echocardiograms were read at two central laboratories without knowledge of the scan time sequence. In intention-to-treat (ITT) analyzes (196 patients), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP) were reduced significantly and equally with the two treatments. Candesartan and enalapril reduced LVMI to the same extent, ie, 15.0 and 13.1 g/m2 (-10.9 and -8.4%; P<0.001 for both). The proportion of patients who achieved LVMI normalization was not significantly higher with candesartan (36.3 vs. 28.6%). Similar results were obtained in per protocol (PP) analyses. The incidence of cough was lower with candesartan (P<0.03); CATCH is the first large study to compare the effects of an AIIA and an ACEI on LVMI. Candesartan cilexetil was found to be as effective as enalapril in reducing SBP, DBP, and LVMI in hypertensive patients with LVH, based on ITT and PP analyses.",0,0

Twenty-seven hypertensive patients were randomized to receive lisinopril (20 mg) or losartan (50 mg) for 5 weeks and subsequently crossed over to the alternative treatment for a second 5-week period. Measurements of CBP, 24-h ABP, and 5-day HBP were performed before randomization and at the end of each treatment period. All measurement methods showed that lisinopril was more effective than losartan in lowering BP. However, the difference between the two drugs was more accurately demonstrated using HBP (P < 0.001) than 24-h ABP (P < 0.01), while the poorest precision in demonstrating this difference was provided by PBC (P < 0.01). 0.05). Lisinopril was also more effective than losartan in reducing PPH (P = 0.01) and 24-h APP (P = 0.03), whereas no such difference was detected using CPP measurements. It was concluded that antihypertensive drugs may differ in their effects not only on BP, but also on PP. SBP monitoring appears to be as reliable as 24-h PAA monitoring in detecting differences in the effect of drugs on both BP and PP. Clinical measurements appear to be the least reliable method, particularly in detecting differences in PP.",0,0

However, this effect was more pronounced and was evident earlier with fosinopril than with amlodipine monotherapy (after 3 versus 18 months of treatment). In addition, the combined therapy provided a greater antialbuminuric effect than the individual drugs. This could be due to the increased antihypertensive effects, although other drug-specific effects cannot be ruled out.

1093,12461307,Sexual dysfunction in patients with hypertension: implications for therapy.,,"Ferrario, Carlos M; Levy, Pavel","Sexual dysfunction associated with hypertension or antihypertensive therapies may affect patients' ability to continue therapy and lead to impaired quality of life for patients. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to become familiar with the wide variation in sexual side effects produced by antihypertensive agents and to discuss the potential occurrence of these side effects with their patients. In many cases, a change in a patient's medication regimen can help patients overcome specific sexual side effects experienced with certain treatments. Physicians should consider selecting antihypertensive therapy that is highly effective in lowering blood pressure but preserves patients' quality of life. The effect of medications on sexual function remains controversial. Some blinded trials report little difference between placebo and specific medications, while other studies indicate that antihypertensive medications increase sexual dysfunction, which has an impact on quality of life. Recent evidence suggests that losartan, an angiotensin II antagonist, is not typically associated with the development of sexual dysfunction and may actually have a positive impact on various indices of sexual function (erectile function, sexual satisfaction, and frequency of sexual activity). ), as well as in the perceived quality of life. . Therefore, angiotensin II antagonists may offer a therapeutic option to prevent or correct erectile dysfunction in patients with hypertension. The favorable effects of these agents on sexual function may be related, in part, to their ability to block angiotensin II, which has recently been recognized as an important mediator of detumescence and possibly erectile dysfunction.",0,0

Mode of death was classified by the investigators and by an independent endpoint committee.; Age, male gender, preexisting ischemic heart disease, increased heart rate, creatinine concentration, and certain drugs taken at randomization were markers of increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death. There were risk markers for sudden death that were different from risk markers for death from chronic heart failure. Low systolic blood pressure at baseline, elevated creatinine, low serum sodium or hemoglobin, and increased heart rate were associated with death from chronic heart failure. The use of beta-blockers or antiarrhythmic agents (primarily amiodarone) was associated with a reduced risk of sudden death, whereas long-acting nitrates and prior use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were markers of increased risk; The use of competing risk analyzes on data from the ATLAS study has identified variables associated with certain modes of death in patients with heart failure.

The trial randomly assigned 19,394 patients to 6 weeks of lisinopril treatment or control, starting treatment within 24 hours of AMI onset; In the 10,661 normotensive patients, lisinopril significantly reduced fatal events, but in the 7,362 hypertensive patients, a higher rate of fatal events was reported on the first day of treatment, with benefits appearing only later. These results can be attributed to the subgroup of 1165 hypertensive patients with low baseline systolic BP (lower quintile, BP <120 mm Hg), in whom critical hypotension was more likely to develop after lisinopril treatment. In fact, these patients showed a higher mortality rate as a result of excess cardiogenic shock during the first day of treatment with lisinopril (odds ratio 3.07, 95% CI 1.39-6.77) and a trend of death persistent and unfavorable after 6 weeks; These data suggest that caution should be exercised when lisinopril is used in the acute phase of myocardial infarction in patients with a history of hypertension but low systolic blood pressure at presentation.",1,1

Medical staff are often frustrated by severe hypertension in those who refuse to take medications at home, drink excessive fluids, miss multiple dialysis sessions, and terminate dialysis early. In addition to addressing the psychosocial, financial, educational, and substance abuse issues that contribute to nonadherence, we have developed a medication strategy to serve as an at least temporary means of lowering blood pressure. Long half-life antihypertensives in renal failure (lisinopril) and/or intrinsically long-acting (transdermal clonidine and amlodipine) were administered on dialysis days by the unit staff to those patients who did not take or would not take that or any dose. on your own. It was ensured that the lisinopril and amlodipine had been taken at least on dialysis days (three times a week), and the clonidine patch was replaced weekly. Thus, sixteen patients were treated when they failed to reliably self-administer medications. They had a significant decrease in predialysis systolic pressure of 15 mm Hg (175 +/- 6 to 160 +/- 5 mm Hg), diastolic of 12 mm Hg (103 +/- 3 to 91 +/- 3 mm Hg), and mean pressure of 13 mm Hg (127 +/- 4 to 114 +/- 4 mm Hg). There was an improvement in blood pressure after dialysis, with a mean pressure decrease of 13 mm Hg from 110 +/- 4 to 97 +/- 4 mm Hg. Many individuals had erratic blood pressure control, having intermittently missed dialysis and thus medication administered in the unit, as well as continuous fluid or drug abuse. Patients had consistently excellent acceptance of this regimen, even on spontaneous request, and had no appreciable adverse effects. In summary, while noncompliance is being addressed by the entire medical team, the administration of long-acting medications in the dialysis unit helps many hypertensive dialysis patients who would otherwise be at increased risk of serious cardiovascular complications.",0,0

Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is reported to contribute to intrarenal hemodynamic abnormality in diabetic patients. We examined whether RAS blockade by captopril induces intrarenal hemodynamic changes in normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes; The patients were between 40 and 65 years of age (20 men and 20 women). A total of 15 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals served as control subjects. The resistance index (RI) of the interlobular arteries was examined by duplex Doppler ultrasound before and after the oral captopril (25 mg) trial; At baseline, no significant differences in IR values or plasma renin activity (PRA) were observed between patients and healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, IR values after captopril challenge were significantly higher than baseline values (P < 0.01). However, in patients with type 2 diabetes, both with normoalbuminuria and microalbuminuria, IR values after the test were significantly lower than baseline values (p < 0.001). There were significant negative correlations between DeltaRI value and HbA1c (r = -0.458, P < 0.005) and between DeltaRI value and baseline PRA in diabetic patients (r = -0.339, P < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that HbA1c and baseline PRA significantly and independently affected the magnitude of the decrease in IR values after captopril administration in diabetic patients (R2 = 0.391, P < 0.0001); These results indicate that the intrarenal RAS can be activated in diabetic patients, that such activation can be affected by poor glycemic control, and that ACE inhibitor blockade of RAS activation reduces intrarenal vascular resistance in diabetic patients. The results emphasize the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition in improving intrarenal hemodynamics in diabetic patients.",0,0

Both classes of agents have a primary mechanism of action of reducing the level of the respective risk factor. They also have mechanisms of action that may confer benefits beyond what is believed to be the main action of the agent. This has led to speculation that statins reduce stroke risk beyond cholesterol reduction, and ACE inhibitors reduce stroke risk beyond blood pressure reduction. We review mounting evidence suggesting that statins and ACE inhibitors have so-called pleiotropic effects that may lead to stroke prevention.",0,0

The critical roles of temporal delay and optimal sustained patency as modulators of successful reperfusion have been repeatedly demonstrated, and research on the ideal interface between pharmacologic and mechanical reperfusion continues. Despite physician awareness and patient education programs, the time from symptom onset to treatment in STEMI remains stagnant at approximately 3 hours for pharmacologic reperfusion, as documented in major clinical trials. Multi-faceted enhancements with advanced paramedic training, 12-lead transmissible EKGs, and bolus fibrinolytics facilitate potential prehospital diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, as we move into the 21st century, it is essential to reexamine strategies to address these and other issues related to the process of providing optimal care for the majority of STEMI patients. Of particular note are the opportunities provided by prehospital management with initiation of therapy, selection of appropriate hospitals, or both, as important potential avenues for further improving patient outcomes. We review previous research in prehospital therapy for STEMI and practical impediments to implementation to establish a framework for interpreting future developments.",0,0

However, no direct comparisons have been made between different ACE inhibitors in the same patient population.; This phase III, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study compared the safety and efficacy of zofenopril and lisinopril in 1024 thrombolyzed patients with acute MI. Patients, 18 to 75 years of age, were randomized to receive oral zofenopril (30-60 mg/day) or lisinopril (5-10 mg/day), beginning within 12 hours of completion of thrombolytic therapy. and continuing for 42 days. The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg), cumulative or drug-related. Secondary endpoints included additional safety and efficacy parameters; The overall incidence of severe hypotension was reduced slightly more with 5 zofenopril (10.9%) than with lisinopril (11.7%, p=0.38). The incidence of severe drug-related hypotension was slightly but significantly lower with zofenopril than with lisinopril (6.7% vs 9.8%, 2-tailed P=0.048). The 6-week mortality rate was 3.2% in the zofenopril group and 4.0% in the lisinopril group (p = 0.38), with no significant difference in the incidence of cardiovascular complications. higher or in any safety variable between the 2 ACEIs. ; The SMILE-2 study demonstrates that both zofenopril and lisinopril are safe and associated with a fairly low rate of severe hypotension when administered according to a titration schedule in thrombolyzed patients with acute myocardial infarction. These findings could have a positive clinical impact and increase the proportion of patients with acute myocardial infarction who can be safely treated with ACE inhibitors.",1,0

As drugs are developed that selectively block these systems, the drop in BP may not be constant over 24 hours; A total of 24 patients (over 65 years of age) with untreated systolic BP (SBP >150 mm Hg) entered a substudy of a larger study conducted in 74 patients. In a double-blind, crossover study with a balanced design, they received placebo, atenolol 50 mg, perindopril 8 mg, felodipine 10 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg. The study periods were 2 months. Ambulatory BP control was performed at the end of each period and was divided into periods of wakefulness (from 9:00 am to 10:00 pm), periods of sleep (from 12:00 am to 6:00 am), and periods morning (6: 00 to 9:00). Medication was taken at 9:00 AM; All four drug classes reduced mean 24-h SBP (p < 0.05), but the drop with atenolol was less than with the other drugs. The fall in awake BP with perindopril was less than with felodipine or hydrochlorothiazide. Atenolol did not cause a significant decrease in sleep or morning SBP, and falls with the other three drugs were significant and greater than falls with atenolol. The decrease in BP during sleep with perindopril was greater than with the other drug classes. The sleep-wake difference in SBP increased with perindopril, remained the same with felodipine and hydrochlorothiazide, and decreased with atenolol; In this study, the response to the different drug classes was different. The response to drugs that work relatively nonspecifically (diuretics, calcium blockers) was relatively constant over 24 hours. Response to beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reflected the activity of control systems. This finding supports the concept of multidrug therapy that may need to be tailored to the time of day.",0,0

However, some dihydropyridines, such as felodipine extended-release (ER), still increase sympathetic activity and thus may be less effective in decreasing LV mass; To assess the effects of long-term antihypertensive treatment with nifedipine-gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) and felodipine-ER compared with enalapril on LV mass in relation to the degree of BP control (assessed by ambulatory BP monitoring of 24 h) and sympathetic activity (assessed by plasma concentrations of catecholamines); Enalapril was started at 10 mg/day, felodipine-ER at 5 mg/day, and nifedipine-GITS at 30 mg/day, all once a day. Doses were increased to 20 mg/day, 10 mg/day, or 60 mg/day, respectively, if office BP remained 160/90 mmHg or higher at the end of the dosing interval. Evaluable echocardiograms were obtained for 116 patients at the end of the study (30 weeks of treatment); In 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, nifedipine-GITS caused a consistent drop in BP over the 24-h dosing interval, whereas felodipine-ER caused a more marked drop in daytime BP, and the effects of enalapril decreased overnight and disappeared overnight. Morning. Only felodipine-ER significantly increased supine and standing plasma norepinephrine by more than 50% similarly after six, 18, and 30 weeks of treatment.

A second objective was to compare the data obtained from the SBPM with those provided by the automatic measurement of BP in the office. A total of 441 patients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomized to receive either telmisartan 40 mg or perindopril 4 mg over a 12-week period. Patients whose clinical DBP remained greater than or equal to 90 mmHg at the end of week 6 (W6) received a double-dose regimen. Office BP and LMWS were performed at baseline (S0), at W6, and at week 12 (W12), both with the same automatic device. A greater decrease in trough DBP was obtained with telmisartan (-6.6+/-6.7 mmHg) than with perindopril (-5.1+/-7.0 mmHg; p=0.018). Regarding clinical BP, the same results were observed. Dose doubling was significantly less frequent with telmisartan (41%; n=85) than with perindopril (55%; n=115, P=0.005).

Patients were titrated to the highest dose of study drug at week 6 if mean seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was > or = 90 mmHg. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in ambulatory DBP in the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval after 12 weeks of treatment. Telmisartan and enalapril produced similar reductions from baseline in DBP and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in all ABPM periods evaluated (last 6 h, 24 h, day and night). Telmisartan produced a significantly greater reduction in mean sitting trough DBP, measured without blinding with an automated ABPM device in the clinic, amounting to a difference of -2.02 mmHg (P < 0.01). A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved a sitting diastolic response with telmisartan than with enalapril (59% vs. 50%; P < 0.05), also measured with the same ABPM device. Both treatments were well tolerated. Compared to telmisartan, enalapril was associated with a higher incidence of cough (8.9% vs. 0.8%) and hypotension (3.9% vs. 1.1%).

1111,12530940,The L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway in hypertension.,,"Kelm, Malte","Nitric oxide is involved in the regulation of resting vascular tone, the adaptation of blood flow to the metabolic demand of the tissue, and the adaptation of vessel diameter to inflow volume, i.e., flow-mediated dilation. Arterial hypertension is associated with increased vascular tone of the resistance vessels, reduced compliance of the ductal arteries, along with intima-media thickening leading to vascular remodeling. The dysfunctional endothelium triggers such maladaptive processes. A reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide has been shown in hypertensive individuals depending on the duration and severity of arterial hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reverse endothelial dysfunction, while a concomitant reduction in significant cardiac events due to better bioavailability has not yet been established. Long-term follow-up studies in individuals with overt endothelial dysfunction and in offspring of hypertensive patients underscore the prognostic and genetic importance of reduced nitric oxide bioavailability for the pathophysiology of arterial hypertension.",0,0

Survival and resource utilization data were collected for 6 months; survival was extrapolated assuming an additional half-life of 3 years based on data from the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study. Costs were based on study drug use and hospitalization at 6-month follow-up. A sensitivity analysis was performed on drug dose and duration of survival; Median survival at 6 months was 157+/-52 days in the levosimendan group and 139+/-64 days in the dobutamine group (P<0.01). When extrapolated up to 3 years, the gain in life expectancy was estimated at 0.35 years (discounted at 3%). Levosimendan increased the mean cost per patient by 1,108, which was entirely due to the cost of the study drug. The incremental cost per year of life saved (LYS) was 3,205 at the European level; in individual countries, the cost per LYS ranged from 3,091 to 3,331. The result was robust in the sensitivity analysis; Although patients in the levosimendan group were alive for more days and therefore at risk of hospitalization for longer, there was no increase in hospitalization or hospitalization costs with levosimendan treatment. The cost per LYS using levosimendan compares favorably with other cost-effectiveness analyzes in cardiology.",0,0

This could be improved with drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which effectively reduce proteinuria; In this longitudinal study, we evaluated the extent to which titration of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril to maximally tolerated doses (median [range]: 30 [10 to 40] mg/d) improved proteinuria and dyslipidemia in 28 patients with chronic kidney disease. non diabetic. Maximum doses of lisinopril significantly and safely reduced proteinuria, serum total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides without substantially affecting serum HDL and renal hemodynamics. Proteinuria has already decreased to 10 mg/day. Serum lipids decreased progressively and in a dose-dependent manner during titration up to the maximum doses. The reduction in total and LDL cholesterol correlated with increases in serum albumin/total protein concentration and oncotic pressure, peaked at the highest doses of lisinopril, and persisted after discontinuation of treatment. Despite a lesser reduction in proteinuria, hypercholesterolemia decreased more (and reflected the increase in serum albumin) in hypoalbuminemic than in normoalbuminemic patients who, despite a greater reduction in proteinuria, had less cholesterol decrease and no change in serum albumin. Changes in serum triglycerides were independent of changes in serum proteins, were strongly correlated with lisinopril dose (r=-0.89, P=0.003), and recovered rapidly after discontinuation of treatment. Lisinopril was well tolerated, did not affect renal hemodynamics, and caused reversible symptomatic hypotension in only two patients; In chronic kidney disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor titration to maximum tolerated doses safely improved hypertriglyceridemia by a direct dose-dependent effect, and hypercholesterolemia through improvement of nephrotic syndrome, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease. with more severe hypoalbuminemia.",0,0

Losartan 50 mg was administered to patients for eight weeks. Throughout the study, blood pressure was measured every two weeks. Routine laboratory investigations were performed before trial entry, week four, and at the end of the study. Adverse effects were recorded. After eight weeks, losartan was discontinued and enalapril 10 mg daily was administered to the same patients after a two-week washout period. The same methodology that was followed for the losartan trial was also repeated for the enalapril trial; Losartan treatment resulted in a highly significant reduction in mean seated diastolic blood pressure. Comparison with enalapril showed that both drugs are equally effective in lowering blood pressure in mild to moderate hypertension. The percentage of responders was slightly higher with losartan than with enalapril (86.7% vs. 76.7%). Adverse events reported with losartan were mild. Enalapril was also well tolerated as losartan but there was a high incidence of dry cough, which was reported in nine patients (30%); Losartan is an effective antihypertensive drug with an excellent safety and tolerability profile. It shows blood pressure lowering efficacy similar to that of enalapril. Unlike enalapril, losartan does not cause a dry cough.",0,0

These patients were then randomly divided into three groups of 10 each, group I - Control; group II--Nifedipine and group III--Enalapril. In groups II and III, Nifidepine 30 mg/day was also added, and in group III Enalapril 10 mg/day, respectively, and treatment was continued for nine months. These patients were followed up monthly to assess drug efficacy, side effects, and any adverse drug reactions.; Of 30, 28 patients completed the study. At the end of nine months of treatment, patients in the control group revealed a significant increase in serum creatinine (1.65 +/- 0.38 to 2.17 +/- 0.31 mg/dl), blood urea blood (34.0 +/- 3.9 to 40.0 +/- 3.1 mg/dl), and 24-hour albuminuria (3.6 +/- 0.6 to 4.2 +/- 0, 6 g) and decreased creatinine clearance (60.3 +/- 13.3 to 37.5 +/- 11.8 m/min); however, in the enalapril group there was a decrease in serum creatinine (1.72 +/- 0.45 to 1.24 +/- 0.58 mg/dl), blood urea (34.6 +/- 4 .7 to 28.1 +/- 6.7 mg/dl) and 24-hour albuminuria (3.3 +/- 1.0 to 1.6 +/- 1.1 g) and increased creatinine clearance ( 56A +/- 15.8 to 77.1 +/- 23.5 mL/min).

Surgical and now angiographic revascularization procedures are increasingly popular approaches to the management of these patients. Results from randomized controlled trials suggest that revascularization may not improve survival but is helpful in improving symptoms and exercise capacity. However, these trials are of limited value because they do not reflect state-of-the-art revascularization techniques or optimal medical management. Because many of these studies were conducted more than a decade ago, patients were recruited before the survival benefits of antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aggressive plasma reduction were accepted. lipids. The Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) trial should help us determine the best approach in these patients. It is a multicenter randomized trial comparing aggressive medical therapy with aggressive medical therapy with the current state-of-the-art percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with stable coronary artery disease. The COURAGE protocol targets global risk reduction by emphasizing 1) lifestyle modification, 2) maximal use of blood pressure lowering medications for goals VI of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC), 3) maximum use of cholesterol-lowering medications below National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III goals for secondary prevention, and 4) maximum use of cholesterol-lowering medications relieve anginal symptoms with or without the best interventional devices for PCI.",0,0
1122,12573198,The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system as a target in coronary disease.,,"O'Keefe, James H; Lurk, Jared T; Kahatapitiya, Ravindra C; Haskin, Janet A","The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a fundamental role in the development of atherosclerosis and adverse cardiovascular events. Traditionally, the pathologic effects of RAAS were assumed to be the result of angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction and aldosterone-induced salt and water retention. However, these hormones also have powerful trophic effects, stimulating mass gain in both the arterial wall and the left ventricle. In addition, angiotensin II and aldosterone predispose to vascular inflammation, thrombosis, oxidative stress, and sudden cardiac death. Therapy targeting RAAS hyperactivity is essential to normalize the prognosis of most patients with atherosclerosis. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor improves the prognosis of patients with atherosclerosis and/or diabetes, even in the setting of normal baseline blood pressure. Angiotensin receptor blockers also improve cardiovascular structure and prognosis. Although these agents are better tolerated than ACE inhibitors, they do not appear to be as effective in reducing event rates. Aldosterone receptor blockers also improve cardiovascular structure, function, and prognosis. Aldosterone receptor blockers appear to provide additional benefit when used in conjunction with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker.",0,0

Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies were conducted in a total of 16 elderly patients with systolic hypertension resistant to conventional antihypertensive therapy. In 1 study, pharmacodynamic responses to single doses of placebo, isosorbide mononitrate, eprosartan, and captopril were determined; the other compared single-dose isosorbide mononitrate and placebo in subjects treated with AII inhibitors at baseline. Blood pressure was measured by sphygmomanometry and pulse wave components by applanation tonometry in the radial artery. All 3 agents were shown to lower brachial systolic blood pressure, aortic systolic blood pressure, and aortic pulse pressure. Qualitative effects on aortic pulse wave contour differed: the rate of increase was not significantly altered by either captopril or eprosartan, but decreased (P<0.0001) by approximately 50% of the placebo value with sodium mononitrate. isosorbide in both study groups.

In total, 96 centers participated in this randomized controlled parallel group study. A total of 829 patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension were randomized, and 790 were eligible for the efficacy (intention-to-treat) analysis. Patients of both sexes, aged between 18 and 75 years, newly diagnosed or untreated in the last month if their diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was > or = 95 and < or = 114 mmHg were included in the study. Initial drug doses were delapril 30 mg + indapamide 1.25 mg tablets once daily or captopril 50 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 15 mg tablets once daily. the daily dose was increased to delapril 30 mg + indapamide 2.5 mg or captopril 50 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg tablets for a further 5 months. The main assessment of antihypertensive efficacy was the percentage of patients who responded after 6 months of pharmacological treatment. Response rates were 72.6% with D+I and 62.9% with C+H (P=0.004 between treatments) after 60 days of treatment, and 92.6% in D+I and 85.2% in C+H (P<0.001 between treatments) at the end of the treatment period. The final value of systolic blood pressure was 134.5+/-13.1 mmHg with D+I and 138.3+/-14.0 mmHg with C+H (P<0.001 between treatments). At the final visit, DBP was 84.57+/-7.0 mmHg in the D+I group and 85.57+/-8.0 mmHg in the control group (P=0.017 between treatments). In total, 11 patients in the D+I group and 19 patients in the C+H group were withdrawn from the study due to adverse events. In total, 30 patients (7.6%) with D+I and 32 patients (8.1%) with C+H experienced adverse events. In conclusion, D+I was more effective than C+H in terms of overall blood pressure reduction and response rate. Greater efficacy was obtained without an increase in adverse effects, since both treatments were equally well tolerated.",0,0

After three days of a standardized diet, 0.154 mol/l saline was infused at 8 ml/kg/h for 4 h. Blood pressure, hormones, and renal function were monitored for 48 h. After four months, the same subjects received captopril (225 mg/day) and the protocol was repeated; Before captopril, saline infusion suppressed the RAAS in LTR but not in HTR, resulting in removal of 86 +/- 12% versus 50 +/- 11% of the sodium load at 48 h post captopril. The infussion. Blood pressure increased only in HTRs (+16 +/- 5/9 +/- 3 mm Hg) and remained elevated for 48 h (p < or = 0.05). After captopril, sodium clearance was comparable in the liver (87 +/- 13%) and heart (86 +/- 12%) groups, and blood pressure did not change in either group. CONCLUSIONS; Heart transplant recipients have attenuated diuretic and natriuretic responses to volume expansion mediated by their inability to suppress the RAAS. Pharmacological suppression of the RAAS normalized defects in blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. These findings indicate that hypertension in HTRs is caused, in part, by a failure of reflex suppression of the RAAS when these patients become hypervolemic.",0,0

In patients with PAD, there were 3 cardiovascular events (13.6%) with intensive treatment compared to 12 events (38.7%) with moderate treatment (p = 0.046). After adjusting for multiple cardiovascular risk factors, an inverse relationship between ankle-brachial index and cardiovascular events was observed with moderate treatment (P=0.009), but not with intensive treatment (P=0.91). Thus, with intensive blood pressure control, the risk of event was not increased, even at the lowest ankle-brachial index values, and was the same as in a patient without PAD; In diabetic patients with PAD, intensive blood pressure reduction to a mean of 128/75 mm Hg resulted in a marked reduction in cardiovascular events.",1,0

Therefore, with the conventional dose, plasma enalaprilat can be markedly increased. It is unclear whether this excess drug exposure allows for better blood pressure control. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the short-term blood pressure response to two different plasma levels of enalaprilat; As part of an open-label, randomized, controlled trial of the effect of high and low doses of enalapril on the progression of renal failure, short-term blood pressure response was evaluated. Data were analyzed on all patients who completed 3 months of follow-up. Patients were assigned to two enalaprilat trough plasma concentrations, above 50 ng mL(-1) (high) (n = 17) or below 10 ng mL(-1) (low) (n = 18), and the daily dose of enalapril titrated accordingly; Median (range) glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at baseline was 18 (7.9) in the high concentration enalaprilat group and 17 (7.3) mL min(-1) 1, 73 m(2) in the low concentration group (NS). Nine patients in each group were on enalapril treatment at baseline with a median daily dose of 5 mg in the high (5-10) and low (2.5-20) concentration groups. At 3-month follow-up, the dose was 10 (2.5-30) and 1.9 (1.25-5) mg (P < 0.0001), respectively.

We evaluated whether participation in a specialist network and use of a common database would impact compliance with the CHF guidelines; We analyzed the rate and determinants of ACE inhibitor use and prescribed doses among 8,102 CHF patients enrolled in 133 cardiology centers participating in a national network; 6,625 patients (82%) took ACE inhibitors, most commonly enalapril (41%, mean dose 16 +/- 9 mg), captopril (25%, mean dose 74 +/- 44 mg), and lisinopril (14%, mean dose mean 13 +/- 8 mg). The predictors of non-prescription of ACE inhibitors were: female gender (odds ratio--OR 1.46, CI 95%-CI 1.28-1.67), older age (OR 1.01, CI 95% 1.01 -1.02), valve etiology (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.60-2.20), NYHA class III-IV (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09-1.42) and creatinine levels > 2.5 mg/dl (OR 5.19, 95% CI 3.36-8.02).

Patients were assigned a target dose of losartan 50 mg/day and captopril 50 mg three times daily, as tolerated. The primary end point was all-cause mortality and there were 499 (18%) and 447 (16%) deaths in the losartan and captopril group, respectively (p = 0.07). However, there were significantly more cardiovascular deaths with losartan (420, 15%) than with captopril (363, 13%; p = 0.03). Losartan was better tolerated than captopril with fewer patients discontinuing medication (17% versus 23% for losartan and captopril, respectively).

A total of 32 mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients (DBP > 90 and < 110 mmHg), aged between 30 and 70 years, were studied. After a 4-week placebo period, they were randomized to receive either amlodipine 5 mg once daily or benazepril 10 mg once daily or amlodipine 5 mg plus benazepril 10 mg once daily for 4 weeks, based on a crossover design. At the end of the placebo period and each active treatment period, blood pressure, AFV, and PSTP were assessed. AFV was measured using the water displacement principle. PSTP was evaluated using a system, the subcutaneous pretibial interstitial environment with a water manometer. Both amlodipine and benazepril monotherapy significantly reduced SBP (-18.2+/-4 and -17.8+/-4 mmHg, respectively, P<0.01 vs. baseline) and DBP (-12 0.1+/-3 and -11.7+/-3 mmHg, respectively, P<0.01); the reduction increased with the combination (-24.2+/-5 mmHg for SBP, P<0.001 and -16.8+/-4 mmHg for DBP, P<0.001). Amlodipine monotherapy significantly increased both AFV (+17.1%, P<0.001 vs. baseline) and PSTP (+56.6%, P<0.001 vs. baseline).

Unfortunately, although heart failure affects men and women equally, women have historically represented a minority in heart failure trials. Despite this disparity, treatment decisions largely depend on these trials. Women with heart failure often have different clinical characteristics than men, such as age of onset and comorbidities. Compared to men, women also show differences in remodeling and response to injury, such as volume or pressure overload and myocardial infarction. We are just beginning to understand the clinical implications of these gender differences and their impact on drug treatments. After discussing these differences, a review of useful agents in systolic failure is provided, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, digoxin, and aldosterone inhibition.

The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in preventing diabetes in patients with left ventricular dysfunction is unknown. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effect of the ACE inhibitor enalapril on the incidence of diabetes in the group of patients from the Montreal Heart Institute enrolled in the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD); Clinical charts were assessed for fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels by blinded reviewers. A diagnosis of diabetes was made when FPG > or =126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) was found at 2 visits (follow-up, 2.9+/-1.0 years). Of the 391 patients enrolled at the Montreal Heart Institute, 291 were non-diabetic (FPG <126 mg/dl with no history of diabetes), 153 of these were taking enalapril and 138 were taking placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. Forty patients developed diabetes during follow-up, 9 (5.9%) in the enalapril group and 31 (22.4%) in the placebo group (P<0.0001). By multivariate analysis, enalapril remained the most powerful predictor for reduced risk of developing diabetes (hazard ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence intervals, 0.10 to 0.46; P < 0.0001). The effect of enalapril was notable in the subgroup of patients with impaired FPG (110 mg/dl [6.1 mmol/l] < or = FPG <126 mg/dl) at baseline: 1 patient (3.3 %) in the enalapril group vs. 12 (48.0%) in the placebo group developed diabetes (P<0.0001); Enalapril significantly reduces the incidence of diabetes in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, especially those with impaired GPA.",1,1

Active treatment consisted of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (4 mg daily), with the addition of the diuretic indapamide at the discretion of the treating physicians. During a mean of 3.9 years of follow-up, active treatment reduced blood pressure by 9/4 mm Hg compared to placebo and reduced the primary outcome, stroke, by 28%. Major coronary events occurred in 269 participants (active 3.8%, placebo 5.0%) and heart failure was diagnosed in 264 participants (active 3.7%, placebo 4.9%).

The benefits of blood pressure lowering therapy for the prevention of fatal and nonfatal strokes in middle-aged people are well established. However, until recently, there was uncertainty about the consistency of such benefits across different groups of patients, and in particular for the elderly and those with a history of stroke. This article reviews the evidence surrounding the efficacy of blood pressure-lowering therapy, specifically in older patients with a history of stroke, with particular attention to the results of the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke (PROGRESS) study. PROGRESS was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 6,105 people with a history of cerebrovascular disease recruited from 172 hospital outpatient clinics in ten countries. Participants (mean age 64 years; range 26-91 years) were randomized to receive active treatment with an ACE inhibitor-based blood pressure-lowering regimen (perindopril) with or without the addition of the diuretic indapamide. , or an equivalent placebo.

Importantly, treatment benefits were consistent across key patient subgroups, including those with and without hypertension, patients who were Asian and non-Asian, and for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke subtypes. The current evidence is now strong for clinicians to consider blood pressure lowering therapy essential in stroke prevention, especially in patients with a known history of cerebrovascular disease (and vascular disease, in general), regardless of levels. blood pressure as soon as possible. patients are clinically stable after an acute stroke or other vascular event. Further age-specific analyzes of the PROGRESS data, along with those from other completed trials, will provide more reliable information on the size of the benefits of blood pressure-lowering therapy, specifically for different age groups, and particularly in the elderly (those over 80 years of age). However, in the meantime, an ACE inhibitor plus diuretic treatment regimen that maximizes the degree of blood pressure reduction has a good safety profile and is an effective treatment that should be considered in all stroke patients. , including the elderly.",0,0

We compared these data to a second, larger data set to determine whether these findings were an isolated or common phenomenon and to determine what factors influenced this difference; Subjects were drug-treated hypertensive patients. Blood pressure measurements were taken from outpatient medical records.; The percentage of hypertensive patients with controlled BP levels was significantly higher (P < 0.001) when the cut-off point of < or = 140/90 mm Hg was used instead of < 140/90 mm Hg. When a single BP measurement was used to estimate control, the percentage of patients with controlled hypertension increased by 12.7% simply by changing the definition to include the level of systolic BP = 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP = 90. When used multiple BP readings for estimation control, the difference was much less pronounced (2.7%); When evaluating the success of hypertension treatment, defining BP control as systolic BP < or = 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP < or = 90 mm Hg will result in more people having controlled BP than when systolic < 140 mm Hg and diastolic < 90 mm Hg diastolic are used. Most likely, this difference is the result of trailing digit preference. Using multiple measures reduces this effect.

However, it is reasonable to conclude that thiazide diuretics, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and perhaps angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be the preferred first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension in diabetes. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are more effective than placebo but may not be as effective as diuretics, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or ACE inhibitors; however, the study results are inconsistent in this regard.; Treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetes, with blood pressure goals of 135/80 mm Hg, provides dramatic benefits. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and ACE inhibitors may be the best first-line treatments, although other agents are usually needed and goals may not be achieved even with three or four agents . Intensive blood pressure control may be the most important factor in preventing adverse outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.",1,0

African-American hypertensives are considered a special population with a higher prevalence of hypertension and, therefore, unique treatment needs. The objective of the study was to review medication use among an urban African American and Latino population in relation to the JNC recommendations. The study population was drawn from a preexisting cohort of African Americans and Latinos. Records were reviewed for self-reporting of hypertension and the use of any antihypertensive medication in people younger than 60 years of age. A small subgroup of people were reviewed separately for specific medications used to treat hypertension. There were 34,118 people in the cohort over the age of 45 and under the age of 60 who qualified for the review; 40% were African American and 60% Latino. Of the 13,593 African Americans, 6,387 (47%) were hypertensive. Of the 20,525 Latinos, 29% were hypertensive. Only 56% of all hypertensives were taking any blood pressure medication (61% of African Americans and 48% of Latinos). Within the subgroup of 550 people with detailed medication information (223 African Americans and 327 Latinos), calcium channel blockers and diuretics were the most commonly used medications among African Americans, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were the most commonly used medications. used among Latinos. Beta blockers were used only 13% of the time. The authors concluded that in this cohort of hypertensive urban African Americans and Latinos, more than 40% of people were not receiving treatment for hypertension and, despite the guidelines suggested in JNC VI, few people were being treated for their hypertension with diuretic monotherapy or beta. blockers as drugs of first choice. Instead, there was extensive use of calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",0,0

Our objective was to assess the frequency of weight loss in patients with this disease, whether the degree of weight loss predicts mortality, and whether weight loss can be prevented with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; We investigated weight changes in 1,929 patients from the SOLVD trial who had chronic heart failure, had no edema at baseline, and survived for at least 4 months after trial entry. The mean follow-up was 35 months (SD 13). We analyzed the effect of weight loss at cutoff points of 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 15% (a priori), and 6% (post hoc) to identify which best predicted outcome. To validate the results, we analyzed data from 619 patients in the V-HeFT II trial.; 817 (42%) patients in the SOLVD trial had a weight loss from baseline of 5% or more. At 8-month follow-up, all cutpoints for weight loss were significantly associated with decreased survival after adjustment for age, sex, New York Heart Association class, left ventricular ejection fraction, and treatment assignment. . Weight loss of 6% or more at any time during follow-up was the strongest predictor of impaired survival (adjusted hazard ratio 2.10, 95% CI 1.77-2.49; p<0.0001 ). Patients taking the ACE inhibitor enalapril had a lower risk of weight loss of 6% or more than those not taking the drug (adjusted reduction of 19%, p=0.0054). The results of the analyzes of the V-HeFT II data supported our findings.; Weight loss occurs frequently in patients with chronic heart disease, its reversal is rare, and when it does occur, it is independently associated with decreased survival. Weight loss of more than 6% should be used to define the presence of cachexia in patients with chronic heart failure. In chronic heart failure, treatment with an ACE inhibitor reduces the risk of weight loss.",0,0

All patients received placebo for a 30-day baseline period followed by 2 months of active therapy and 1 day off medication. ABPM was performed in each period. 24-h antihypertensive coverage was assessed using the minimum index methods: peak (T/P) and smoothness index (SI).

We evaluated the temporal profiles of action of ACE-I and ARB on urinary protein and nitrate/nitrate (NO(x)) excretion in hypertensive patients (140 and/or 90 mmHg) with chronic kidney disease (serum creatinine < 265 (range , 44-265) micromol/l or creatinine clearance > 30 (range, 30-121) mL/min). Patients with mild (<1 g/day; range, 0.4-1.0) and moderate (>1 g/day; range, 1.1-6.9) proteinuria were randomly assigned to groups treated with ACE-I and ARB, and were treated with ACE-I (trandolapril or perindopril) or ARB (losartan or candesartan) for 48 weeks. In all groups, ACE-I or ARB treatment reduced blood pressure to the same level, but had no effect on creatinine clearance. In patients with mild proteinuria, neither ACE-I nor ARB altered urinary protein excretion. In patients with moderate proteinuria, ACE-I caused a 44 +/- 6% reduction in proteinuria (from 2.7 +/- 0.5 to 1.5 +/- 0.4 g/day, n = 14 ) at 12 weeks, and this beneficial effect persisted throughout the protocol (48 weeks, 1.2 +/- 0.2 g/day). In contrast, ARB did not produce a significant decrease in proteinuria at 12 weeks (23 +/- 8%, n = 13), but a 41 +/- 6% reduction in proteinuria was observed at 48 weeks. Similarly, although early (12 weeks) increases in urinary excretion of NO(x) were observed with ACE-I (from 257 +/- 70 to 1111 +/- 160 micromol/day) and ARB (from 280 +/- - 82 to 723 +/- 86 micromol/day), the ARB-induced increase in NO(x) excretion was less than that of ACE-I (P < 0.05). In conclusion, although both ACE-I and ARBs lower blood pressure similarly, the effect of these agents on proteinuria differs in chronic kidney disease with moderate proteinuria. A relatively early onset of proteinuria-lowering effect was observed with ACE-I, which paralleled the increase in urinary NO(x) excretion. In contrast, ARB decreased proteinuria and gradually increased urinary NO(x) excretion. These time-course dependent changes in proteinuria and urinary NO(x) may reflect the pharmacological property of ACE-I and ARB, with respect to action on bradykinin.",0,0

Patients in group 1 received enalapril 5 mg alone, group 2 received enalapril 5 mg + prazosin 1 mg, and group 3 received enalapril 5 mg + atenolol 50 mg. All medications were taken daily for 4 weeks. Blood pressure, heart rate, pressure-frequency product, 6-minute walk test, NYHA class, and cardiac autonomic reflexes were measured at baseline and again at 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA and one-way ANOVA were used in data analysis; All 3 treatments caused significant (P<0.001 ANOVA) and similar improvements for the NYHA class (-1.0 to -1.6), and increased 6-minute walk distance (+130 m to +205 m). Although no differences were observed between treatments, there was a trend suggesting greater improvement with enalapril + atenolol. At week four, the sympathoplegic treatments, enalapril + atenolol and enalapril + prazosin, caused significant reductions in the pressure rate product (-3726 +/- 1885 mm Hg x beats/min; -3498 +/- 396 mm Hg beats/min, respectively), (compared to enalapril alone (-1349 +/- 894 mm Hg x beats/min) (p < 0.001 ANOVA). During the Valsalva maneuver, phase IV bradycardias were significantly higher after treatment with enalapril + atenolol (944 +/- 66 msec) or with enalapril + prazosin (825 +/- 48 msec), compared with enalapril alone (760 +/- 45 msec) (P<0.001 ANOVA).Valsalva tachycardia phase II was similar between Respiratory sinus arrhythmia ratio was significantly increased (p < 0.005 ANOVA) and equally in all treatments, however, pressor and chronotropic responses to isometric forearm grip were significantly increased in the enalapril + prazosin combination (p < 0.02), compared to the other treatments then.; Our findings demonstrated not only the safety of providing alpha-1 or beta-1 receptor blockade therapy concurrent with ACE inhibition in blacks with CHF, but also the resulting improvement in exercise tolerance and NYHA class. Compared with the use of ACE inhibition alone, the combined therapies caused a marked reduction in the product of pressure rate, an index of myocardial oxygen consumption, and a greater improvement in cardiac parasympathetic activity. Selective beta-1 blockade caused a greater increase in vagal activity of central baroreceptors compared to alpha-1 blockade. In contrast, pressor and chronotropic abnormalities during isometric forearm handgrip in CHF were normalized by alpha-1 but not beta-1 blockade. Therefore, the combined reflex cardiac vagal enhancement after selective beta-1 blockade and the hemodynamic effects of alpha-1 antagonism with simultaneous ACE inhibition may be of great therapeutic and prognostic benefit in blacks with noncongestive heart failure. ischemic (hypertensive) stabilized with digoxin. and diuretics.",0,0

The main goal of treating high blood pressure in this population is to prevent or reduce the likelihood of target organ damage. The goal of treatment for high blood pressure, therefore, should be defined based on the optimal means of preventing cardiovascular and renal events. Reducing high blood pressure with drug therapy is associated with reduced cardiovascular events, kidney disease, and associated mortality. However, many questions remain. Some of the basic and important questions include the following: What should be the goal of treated blood pressure in the diabetic? Are there preferred agents that should be used in the hypertensive diabetic population? How do angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers fit together? Are there advantages of one class over the other? The aim of this review is to summarize the findings of recent clinical trials and try to provide evidence-based recommendations from these trials to help the clinician better choose blood pressure goals and treatment strategies in the diabetic population.",0,0

The Joint National Committee VI recommendation for target blood pressure is less than 130/85 mm Hg in diabetics, a more aggressive target than in nondiabetic patients. Data from the last decade support these aggressive targets, especially for cardiovascular and renal outcomes and overall mortality. Furthermore, in diabetics, blood pressure appears to be a continuous risk factor for these outcomes with no evidence of a J-point effect. Although these goals are rarely achieved in diabetic patients, studies show that they can be achieved with attention to details and use of multiple antihypertensive agents.",0,0

In that trial, participants with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (New York Association class I or II, left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 0.35, no treatment for heart failure) were randomized to enalapril or placebo and followed for a mean (+/- SD) of 34 +/- 14 months. The presence of an S(3) and elevated jugular venous pressure was determined by physical examination at the time of study enrollment. We used multivariate proportional hazards models to determine whether these physical examination findings were associated with the development of heart failure, a prespecified endpoint of the SOLVD prevention trial.; At baseline, 209 subjects (5.1%) had S(3) and 70 (1.7%) had elevated jugular venous pressure. Heart failure developed in 1044 subjects (25.5%).

We investigated the relationships between LV size, hypertrophy, and function and ventricular arrhythmias in 263 patients in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study, using quantitative 2D echocardiography and ambulatory ECG monitoring after myocardial infarction; Transthoracic 2D echocardiograms and arrhythmia monitoring were performed at baseline (mean, 11 days) and 1 and 2 years after infarction. LV size, short-axis muscle area (LVMA), and function were quantified from 2D echocardiograms. The prevalence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and frequent ventricular ectopy (premature ventricular contractions [PVC] >10/h) was assessed from the ambulatory ECG. VT and PVCs >10/hr occurred in 20% and 29% of patients at baseline, 22% and 35% at 1 year, and 23% and 39% at 2 years, respectively . VT and PVCs >10/h at baseline and at 1 and 2 years were significantly associated with LV size, LAV, and function. In addition, changes in LV size and function from baseline to 2 years predicted both VT and PVC >10/h. The study was underpowered to detect the treatment effect of ACE inhibitors and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, but did not alter the relationships between ventricular arrhythmias, LV size, and function.; Quantitative echocardiographic evaluation of LV size, LVMA, and function and changes in these measurements over time predict ventricular arrhythmias after infarction. Altered LV architecture and function during postinfarct LV remodeling provides an important substrate for triggering high-grade ventricular arrhythmias.",0,0

The following are the key messages(1) In people older than 50 years, systolic blood pressure (BP) of more than 140 mm Hg is a much more important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) than diastolic BP; (2) CVD risk, starting at 115/75 mm Hg, doubles with each increase of 20/10 mm Hg; normotensive people at age 55 have a 90% lifetime risk of developing hypertension; (3) People with a systolic BP of 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic BP of 80 to 89 mm Hg should be considered prehypertensive and require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent cardiovascular disease; (4) Thiazide-type diuretics should be used in the pharmacological treatment of most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, either alone or in combination with drugs from other classes. Certain high-risk conditions are compelling indications for the initial use of other classes of antihypertensive medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); (5) Most patients with hypertension will require 2 or more antihypertensive medications to achieve target BP (<140/90 mm Hg, or <130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease); (6) If BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above target BP, consideration should be given to starting therapy with 2 agents, 1 of which should generally be a thiazide-type diuretic; and (7) The most effective therapy prescribed by the most careful physician will control hypertension only if patients are motivated. Motivation improves when patients have positive experiences and trust in the doctor. Empathy builds trust and is a powerful motivator. Finally, in presenting these guidelines, the committee recognizes that the judgment of the responsible physician remains paramount.",0,0

Based on multivariate Cox analysis, enalapril was the strongest predictor of AF risk reduction (hazard ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.44; P<0.0001); Treatment with the ACEi enalapril markedly reduces the risk of developing atrial fibrillation in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.",0,0
1189,12779302,Pharmacotherapy for heart failure in patients with renal failure.,,"Shlipak, Michael G","Clinical trials have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and spironolactone improve survival in patients with heart failure. Because patients with heart failure and renal failure have been underrepresented in these trials, little evidence is available to guide clinicians in the optimal management of patients with both conditions. Approximately one-third to one-half of patients with heart failure have renal failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), and renal failure is among the strongest predictors of mortality in patients with heart failure. Evidence supports the use of ACE inhibitors to improve survival in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR, 30 to 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), but there is little evidence to weigh the risks and benefits in patients with more advanced renal dysfunction. Beta-blockers improve survival in patients with heart failure, and their beneficial effect is unlikely to differ by renal function. Spironolactone improves outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure, but renal insufficiency appears to increase the risk of hyperkalemia and limits the use of the drug in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Future clinical trials in heart failure should include a representative number of patients with renal failure to improve the evidence base and outcomes in this vulnerable population.",0,0

Patients were randomized in a stratified design to receive initial treatment with enalapril or nisoldipine and with intensive or moderate treatment goals. We measured an electrocardiographic index for increased left ventricular mass, Cornell voltage adjusted, serially by treatment group. The association between changes in electrocardiographic voltage and cardiovascular events was defined with Cox proportional hazards analysis; At 5 years of follow-up, the decrease in adjusted Cornell voltage was significantly greater for enalapril-treated patients than for nisoldipine-treated patients (repeated measures analysis of variance P = 0.002). In the Cox proportional hazards model, treatment assignment (enalapril versus nisoldipine) was the strongest predictor of cardiovascular events, but presence of coronary heart disease at baseline, duration of diabetes mellitus, and change in voltage were also independent predictors of cardiovascular events; In the ABCD study, treatment with enalapril was associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction. The reduction in left ventricular mass reflected by the decrease in electrocardiographic voltage may explain part, but not all, of the effect of enalapril in this study.",0,0

A direct intervention cost was calculated from the contact time (scheduled and unscheduled) spent by the MDC team. Unplanned hospitalization costs for HF were calculated at a rate of 242 per day. The results were determined in monetary terms, that is, the cost of the service per hospitalization avoided and the net costs/savings at 3 months; The cost of direct intervention by the MDC team was 5,860, with a mean cost per patient of 113 (95% CI: 97-128). At 3 months, there were a total of 12 unplanned HF readmissions in the CR group (25.5% rate, 195 days) compared with 2 in the MDC group (3.9% rate, 17 days). The number needed to treat to prevent one HF hospitalization was 6 in 3 months. The cost of the service per prevented hospitalization was 586. The intervention produced a net cost saving of 37,216 for 51 patients treated for 3 months. Sensitivity analyzes using a 50% variance in costs and lower relative risk reductions confirmed cost benefits of the intervention; HF's MDC remains profitable when combined with optimal medical care. Significant clinical and cost benefits suggest that this intensive approach to MDC and medical management should become the standard of care for heart failure.",0,0

Group A received lisinopril 10 mg/day, while group B received lisinopril 10 mg/day and pentoxifylline 600 mg/day for nine months. There were no significant differences between serum creatinine, HbA1c, blood pressure, and urinary albumin excretion in both groups (p > 0.05); Serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, blood pressure, and HbA1c levels did not change significantly during the study.

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) provides effective BP lowering and renal protection in hypertensive diabetic patients. But despite this, recommended BP levels may be difficult to achieve and dual blockade therapy could be a possible way to obtain efficient BP reduction in hypertensive patients with diabetes. Dual blockade therapy is based on the principle of obtaining the broadest and most effective blockade of angiotensin II by using the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB; The Candesartan and Lisinopril Microalbuminuria Study (CALM II) is a single-center, single-observer, double-blind, randomised, active-controlled, parallel-group study investigating the efficacy and tolerability of candesartan cilexetil in combination with lisinopril, compared with the maximum recommended dose of lisinopril in hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus.

Our aim was to investigate these effects of ACE inhibition in the same group of patients with essential hypertension.; Nine untreated non-smoking hypertensive patients (38.3+9 years, 4/5 men/women) and 12 age-matched healthy subjects (35.2+6.7 years, 5/7 men/women) were included in the study. women). Hypertensive patients received enalapril maleate (5-40 mg/day) for six months. The following parameters were studied at the beginning and at the end of the treatment period. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured using a formula derived from an oral glucose tolerance test and called the insulin sensitivity index (ISI). Insulin was measured by chemiluminescence and glucose by a glucose oxidase method. Endothelial function was assessed as flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery by ultrasonography and expressed as a percent change relative to baseline diameter. Endothelium-independent vasodilation was measured after sublingual nitroglycerin; FMD was affected in the hypertensive group compared to healthy subjects (7.3+3.1% vs. 15.3+4.8%, p<0.0005), and ISI values were 1 .18+0.6 vs. 4.4+0.9 (p<0.0001) respectively.

The current study tests the hypothesis that initial therapy with a fixed-dose combination will reach the recommended blood pressure goal in patients with type 2 diabetes faster than conventional monotherapy. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study had as its primary endpoint the achievement of blood pressure <130/85 mm Hg.

Furthermore, mPAP, PVR, and post-exercise lactate concentration were lower in the captopril group than in the placebo group in patients with genotype II or ID, but not in those with genotype DD. PvO(2) after exercise was greater with captopril than with placebo in patients with genotype II, but not in those with the other genotypes; These findings suggest that pulmonary hemodynamic variables and tissue oxygenation status during exercise depend on ACE genotypes, and that captopril administration effectively influences these exercise-related variables.

The influence of the blood pressure (BP) lowering effect in some studies could also contribute to this lack of conclusion. To examine the possibility that benefit differs depending on underlying kidney disease, we conducted a crossover therapeutic trial of combination therapy in two selected homogeneous groups of patients with diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease. The BP lowering effect was excluded during the study. Nineteen patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy, as examples of non-diabetic kidney disease, and 24 patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy were selected as study subjects. Subjects had to meet the following criteria: a creatinine clearance (Ccr) between 25 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, a 24-hour urinary protein excretion rate greater than 1.0 g/day, and a BP maintained below 130/80 mmHg, with more than six months of treatment with ramipril, (5.7 +/- 0.4 mg/day, 13 +/- 2 months). Baseline data between the two groups showed no significant differences. After a 12-week stabilization period (control period), candesartan 4 mg once daily was administered (combination period) followed by placebo (placebo period), or vice versa, in addition to ramipril. for 12 weeks. The combination with candesartan did not modify Ccr, BP, serum and urinary electrolytes, or urea. The 24-hour urinary protein excretion rate was significantly reduced by combination therapy in patients with IgA nephropathy (3.1 +/- 0.3 g/day in combination, 4.2 +/- 0.3 in control and 4.3 +/- 0.2 in placebo, p < 0.05). However, patients with diabetic nephropathy did not show a reduction in their proteinuria with combination therapy (3.8 +/- 0.2 g/day in combination, 3.9 +/- 0.3 in control and 4.1 +/- /- 0.3 in placebo, p=NS). Changes in proteinuria were not related to changes in BP in IgA nephropathy. In conclusion, the benefit of combination therapy from its antiproteinuric effect was different between IgA and diabetic nephropathy during the 12-week trial. The difference in the pathophysiological role and importance of the renin-angiotensin system between the two diseases could contribute to the discrepancy in the result. We suggest that discrimination of underlying kidney diseases in the study subjects is an important prerequisite for future studies on this topic.",0,0

The pathogenesis of LVH is complicated. In addition to hemodynamic load (pressure or volume overload) and demographic factors, various humoral trophic factors, such as angiotensin II, aldosterone, endothelin, leptin, and catecholamines, may also contribute to the development and progression of LVH. Effective antihypertensive therapy can reverse LVH and prevent its development. LVH regression decreases subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Commonly used drugs have various effects on LVH. Angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to be the most effective. Several new agents, including direct antifibrotic drugs, aldosterone blockade, vasopeptidase inhibitors, and endothelin receptor antagonists that more specifically target the underlying pathogenesis of LVH, may provide us with innovative approaches to treat LVH.

1207,12844467,Lessons from trials in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients.,,"Ruilope, Luis M","There is incontrovertible evidence that the association of type 2 diabetes with hypertension markedly increases the risk of cardiovascular events, death, and kidney disease. In type 2 diabetes, even blood pressure values generally considered to be below the threshold for hypertension (ie, 140/90 mm Hg) in non-diabetic subjects represent an additional risk of clinical relevance. The evidence that a more intense reduction in blood pressure is beneficial in type 2 diabetes over a less intense reduction is also overwhelming. However, most published trials show the need for combination therapy in the vast majority of patients, and even with combination therapy it is difficult to achieve the expected target blood pressure, particularly target systolic blood pressure. It must be recognized that the systolic blood pressure goal of less than 130 mm Hg is very difficult to achieve in diabetics. The evidence for the superiority or inferiority of different classes of drugs is vague and contradictory. Recent evidence on angiotensin II receptor antagonists has shown a significant reduction in cardiovascular events, cardiovascular death, and total mortality when losartan was compared with atenolol, but not when irbesartan was compared with amlodipine. When renal endpoints are considered, the evidence for the benefit of angiotensin II receptor antagonists in type 2 diabetes is stronger than that available with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Primary prevention of the development of microalbuminuria appears to be greatly facilitated by strict control of blood pressure. However, reaching normal blood pressure levels (<130/80 mm Hg) does not seem to ensure better maintenance of the glomerular filtration rate.",0,0

There is little sustainable evidence of pressure-independent benefits for any drug class at this time. Therefore, by combining these findings with additional information on blood pressure target levels and safety in addition to aspirin and statin use, we can formulate health care policies that attack hypertension in a holistic, risk-based manner. The future will focus on additional benefit to patients by testing the efficacy and superiority of drug combinations using novel agents that favorably influence intermediate markers, such as arterial stiffness, and halt the increasing burden of cognitive decline. and dementia.",0,0

Omapatrilat was intended to treat patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. Initial preclinical and clinical studies conducted with omapatrilat were very promising. Indeed, omapatrilat appeared to be a very potent antihypertensive agent with very favorable effects on cardiac function in patients with heart failure. In contrast to these early studies, the large clinical trials were more disappointing. The results of the OCTAVE trial confirmed the antihypertensive efficacy of omapatrilat, but at the price of an angioedema rate three times that of an ACE inhibitor in the general population (2.17% vs. 0.68%), and almost four times higher in the general population. black population. In OVERTURE, a large randomized controlled trial in heart failure, angioedema was also more common with omapatrilat, but the incidence was much lower (0.8% with omapatrilat vs. 0.5% with enalapril). However, omapatrilate was not convincingly superior to the ACE inhibitor. Because angioedema is likely a side effect of the vasopeptidase inhibitor class, the increased incidence of this life-threatening complication with omapatrilat has likely stopped the development of this new class of agents. The future of vasopeptidase inhibitors will depend on the ability to improve the risk/benefit ratio, either by developing agents that produce less angioedema or by more precisely defining a high-risk population that could benefit from dual ACE/NEP inhibition.",0,0

However, there is controversy about its efficacy in patients with small infarcts and preserved LV systolic function. The aim of the present study was to detect the influence of ACE-I perindopril on global LV performance in patients with pure inferior AMI (MI-I) using a Doppler-derived index (DI) that combines systolic and diastolic time intervals (index Tey). Our study included 40 patients with first AMI-I, mean age 60 years +/- 9.06 years (SD) and 24 normal patients matched for age and sex who constituted the control group (COG). Patients were randomized into two groups to receive conventional AMI-I treatment (GCT) or prior therapy plus P (GP). Full Doppler echocardiography (systolic and diastolic parameters), DI, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were measured on day 8.07 +/- 1.16 (SD) postinfarction. The same examination was performed at the COG. The DI was significantly lower in healthy patients (0.45 +/- 0.23) compared to the value in GP (0.56 +/- 0.03; P = 0.023) or GCT (0.78 +/- 0.03) patients. /-0.05, P = 0.000). Furthermore DI was higher in patients from GCT compared to that from GP (P = 0.000). In addition, perindopril administration decreased isovolumic relaxation time (IRT; 120.00 +/- 4.23 vs 139.00 +/- 6.74; P = 0.006) and significantly increased ejection time (ET; 274.25 +/- 7.35 vs. 253.50 +/- 7.68); P = 0.042). SBP in GP patients was similar to that of GCT (120.5 +/- 2.85 mmHg vs. 112.5 +/- 3.49 mmHg; P = NS); The global function of the LV (DI) is altered in patients with AMI-I. Perindopril administration has a favorable impact on LV performance in IAMI patients, achieved through improvement of diastolic function (IRT), which indirectly improves LV systolic function (ET, DI). This beneficial influence of perindopril is the result of the drug's direct tissue effect and not its hemodynamic action.",0,0

The target blood pressure was 135/85 mm Hg or less. The rate of decline in residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the development of complete anuria were compared between groups; Over 12 months, mean residual GFR decreased by 2.07 mL/min per 1.73 m2 in the ramipril group vs. 3.00 mL/min per 1.73 m2 in the control group (p = 0.03) .

Aldosterone has been overlooked as a mediator of RAAS escape and a key factor in target organ injury despite the use of available RAAS blockers. Aldosterone is believed to play a role in the development of hypertension, alteration of vascular structure, vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction, structural kidney injury, proteinuria, left ventricular remodeling, synthesis of collagen and myocardial fibrosis.

The optimal dose of these RAS blockers required to slow the progression of kidney disease or prevent the development of cardiovascular risk is unknown. However, data from many studies strongly support the use of higher doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs to reduce proteinuria. All studies of kidney disease progression show benefit in slowing only when blood pressure is lowered by using higher doses.

Controlled trials have shown the benefits of lowering blood pressure for all hypertensive people, including those 65 years and older. Calcium antagonists of the dihydropyridine subclass, including nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine, and nitrendipine, as well as other drug classes, are potent antihypertensive agents that may be suitable for the treatment of hypertension in older adults. However, as with all antihypertensive agents, side effects may limit their use; peripheral edema is particularly troublesome for the dihydropyridines. The newer dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers expected to be approved for use soon, including lercanidipine and lacidipine, have been associated with comparable efficacy to currently available calcium channel blockers but with a lower incidence of adverse effects, especially ankle swelling. Antihypertensive agents with better tolerability profiles offer the potential to improve blood pressure control.",0,0

Of the total number of patients, 16 men and 6 women, age 45 +/- 13 years, duration of diabetes 19 +/- 11 years, insulin dose 38 +/- 11 U/day, 10 were normotensive and 12 hypertensive. After 3 months of run-in, patients were assigned to treatment with 5 mg or 10 mg of enalapril based on the presence of normotension or hypertension, respectively. Before and after 6 months of treatment, renal function was assessed by evaluating glomerular filtration rate (99m Tc-DTPA), renal plasma flow (131-I iodohippurate), filtration fraction, and renal vascular resistance. Mean arterial pressure, albumin excretion rate, urinary urea excretion, and glycosylated hemoglobin were also measured; Enalapril administration caused a significant drop in mean arterial pressure, albumin excretion rate, glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction, and renal vascular resistance in both groups of patients. The decrease in albumin excretion did not correlate with a decrease in systemic blood pressure or filtration fraction. No significant variations were observed in renal plasma flow, urinary urea excretion, or glycosylated hemoglobin; Our results suggest that low-dose enalapril is effective in influencing renal hemodynamics and reducing urinary albumin excretion in normotensive and hypertensive type 1 diabetic (insulin dependent) patients with early or overt nephropathy. The reducing effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on albuminuria appears to be independent of the action on systemic blood pressure and renal hemodynamic changes.",0,0

Ketoprofen had no effect on 24-hour urinary sodium excretion (160 +/- 33 and 147 +/- 39 mmol/24 h for ketoprofen and placebo, respectively). Ketoprofen had no effect on glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and filtration fraction.

1235,1345141,Hypertensive retinal vascular changes: relationship with left ventricular hypertrophy and arteriolar changes before and after treatment.,,"DahlÃ¶f, B; Stenkula, S; Hansson, L","Twenty-eight treatment-naïve men with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were photographed from the fundus of the eyes. The same eye was evaluated before and after 26 weeks of double-blind treatment with Enalapril or Hydrochlorothiazide. Vascular changes were evaluated using a more elaborate and refined classification than the Keith-Wagener-Barker scale. All photos were reviewed by the same observer without knowledge of blood pressure, type of treatment, or the order in which the photos were taken. There were significant positive correlations between untreated retinal vascular changes and left ventricular wall thickness (echocardiography), calf minimal vascular resistance (plethysmography), and blood pressure, respectively. Enalapril treatment significantly decreased the retinal artery wall reflex and non-significantly reduced arterial narrowing and arteriovenous crossing phenomena. Hydrochlorothiazide did not affect any of the retinal vascular changes. It can be concluded that this relatively simple technique of evaluating fundus photographs with a new grading scale, when used in non-malignant hypertension, provides a useful assessment of the degree of hypertensive target organ damage in the retina, as well as in other important target organs, ie the heart and vascular beds. In addition, Enalapril positively affects hypertensive retinopathy unlike Hydrochlorothiazide, mirroring what happens with cardiovascular structural changes in the rest of the body.",0,0

A tool for a more complete evaluation.,,"EnstrÃ¶m-Granath, I","To investigate the usefulness of more complete blood pressure measurements, performed during daily life, in the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension; A blood pressure check was carried out on middle-aged men and women in Kävlinge, a municipality in southern Sweden. Subjects were classified according to Swedish standard criteria. Ambulatory blood pressure (amb-BP) was recorded in a random sample of normotensive and borderline hypertensives, as well as in all untreated hypertensives identified at screening and willing to participate. A subgroup of borderline hypertensives also perform self-monitoring of blood pressure (self-BP) both at work and at home. The blood pressure-lowering efficacy of atenolol 50 mg once daily and enalapril 20 mg once daily was compared in hypertensive patients at rest, over 24 hours, and during dynamic and isometric exercise. The efficacy of enalapril and lisinopril (two ACE inhibitors with different duration of action) was also compared, with special emphasis on early morning hours; Men and women classified as normotensive were clearly differentiated from hypertensives, also when blood pressure was recorded using the ambulatory technique. The number of subjects correctly classified did not differ between own BP and office BP; combining the two added little. Atenolol lowered blood pressure better during dynamic exercise than enalapril, while there was no significant difference in effect between enalapril and lisinopril, even 18-24 hours post-dose; In evaluating the treatment of hypertension, more comprehensive blood pressure measurements should be considered. However, Office BP seems like a reasonably good tool for diagnosing hypertension.",0,0

Studies on the effect of antihypertensive therapy.,,"DahlÃ¶f, B","These studies were conducted to evaluate different manifestations of structural cardiovascular changes and the effects of antihypertensive therapy in essential hypertension. A meta-analysis of 109 studies that had examined the effect of different blood pressure-lowering drug regimens on the structure of the left ventricle, examined by echocardiography, was performed to increase statistical power, resolve uncertainty, and improve the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of effect. Strict pre-established criteria were applied. The effect of different drugs in monotherapy, and in particular of first-line antihypertensive therapies, was compared using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and calcium antagonists reduced left ventricular mass (LVM) through a reduction in wall hypertrophy, the effect being more pronounced with ACE inhibitors. In contrast, diuretics reduced LVM primarily through a reduction in left ventricular volume. Treatment-naïve men (n = 28, 86 kg, 46 years, 27 kg/m2) with nonmalignant essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 95 mmHg 3-4 times (in triplicate) with placebo) they were randomized to long-term double-blind treatment with enalapril (E) or hydrochlorothiazide (H). There were no significant differences between the groups at the beginning of the study. Vascular alterations in the retina (fundus photography, refined classification), cardiac morphology (M-mode echocardiography, ASE), structural vascular changes of the hand (plethysmography, minimal resistance (Rmin)), total peripheral resistance ((TPR) , calculated from dye dilution) and blood pressure (intra-arterial) were significantly interrelated at baseline, except LVM and Rmin. After 6 months of therapy, E reduced signs of retinal vascular changes as well as Rmin in hand circulation, whereas H did not change or increased these structural vascular changes. The blood pressure-lowering effect of E (mainly through reduction of TPR) tended to be more pronounced, measured both intra-arterially and indirectly, than that seen with H (mainly through reduction of cardiac output); however, there were no significant differences. LVM progressively decreased with E while the effect of H was not significant. E reduced the wall thickness but not the diameter of the left ventricle and also significantly improved the compliance of the left ventricle. The effect on cardiac morphology was significantly different between therapies when the change in blood pressure was taken into account. After the longest follow-up with monotherapy (18 months), E reduced LVM by 2.7 g/mmHg and H (14 months) by 1.3 g/mmHg (significant only for E). In univariate analysis, changes in cardiovascular structure were significantly related to changes in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0,0

Insulin sensitivity was assessed using a modified insulin suppression test. Blood pressure (BP), insulin sensitivity, and serum lipoprotein concentrations were compared before and after each treatment and between the two treated groups. BP decreased significantly and comparably during treatment with enalapril and atenolol (p < or = 0.01). Insulin sensitivity improved by 15% (p = 0.03) in the enalapril group and worsened by 17% (p < or = 0.01) in the atenolol group. Serum lipoprotein concentrations were not modified by any treatment. The improvement in insulin sensitivity caused by treatment with enalapril seems to be an advantage over treatment with atenolol in hypertensive, obese and dyslipidemic patients, while the hypotensive efficacy of both drugs is similar. Because this effect has been reported with other ACE inhibitors, it appears to be characteristic of the entire class of ACE inhibitors.",0,0

Symptoms and physical findings can be helpful in diagnosis but have limited sensitivity and specificity. Objective measurement of ventricular function is essential in virtually all patients in whom a diagnosis of heart failure is suspected. Reversible causes of heart failure should be sought. Outpatient management includes education and counseling, emphasis and evaluation of adherence to diet and pharmacological treatment. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the mainstay of treatment, but they are underused, and maximum doses do not appear to be given because of concerns about side effects. Diuretic therapy should be given only when necessary to control fluid overload. Calcium channel blockers are relatively contraindicated in patients with impaired ventricular function. Patient follow-up should be guided by the results of the medical history and physical examination. Routine serial testing of ventricular function and exercise performance is discouraged.",0,0

In an effort to provide more information on this topic, we examined the effects of captopril on work capacity in patients who had low ejection fractions but without congestive heart failure after AMI. One hundred sixty-six participants were recruited from 5 centers after randomization to captopril or placebo for the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement study. Vertical cycle ergometer tests with continuous respiratory gas measurements were performed at 4, 12, and 24 months after AMI. Our study is consistent with 2 of 3 previous post-AMI studies and supports the conclusion that work capacity is not affected by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition at 4 or 12 months after AMI in patients without congestive heart failure. . Furthermore, no significant effect of captopril was observed 24 months after AMI. Maximal oxygen consumption tended to decrease between 12 and 24 months in the placebo group by a mean (+/- SD) of -22 +/- 322 mL/min (n = 66), but increased in the captopril group (+62 +/- 289, n = 57), a difference that was significant (Mann-Whitney chi-square, p = 0.02).

Patients were randomized to receive different doses of enalaprilat (0.625, 1.25, 2.5 and 5mg). Response to treatment was defined as a stable reduction in systolic blood pressure below 180 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg within 45 minutes of starting treatment and relief of symptoms in patients with hypertensive emergencies; In 41 (63%) of 65 patients, the treatment goal was achieved. Twenty-four patients (37%) did not achieve the treatment goal within 45 minutes of enalaprilat administration. Response rates in the 0.625 mg, 1.25 mg, 2.5 mg, and 5 mg groups were 67%, 65%, 59%, and 62%, respectively. The proportion of initially randomized patients who responded to treatment did not differ between any of the four enalaprilat dose groups. There were no significant differences by enalaprilat dose with respect to changes in systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure. No serious side effects were noted.; Enalaprilat is a safe antihypertensive drug with moderate efficacy in the treatment of hypertensive crises. Since doses above 0.625 mg do not alter response rates or the magnitude of blood pressure reduction, we recommend 0.625 mg as the starting dose in the treatment of hypertensive crisis.",0,0

Ambulatory blood pressure was recorded with placebo in 143 hypertensive patients (diastolic pressure on conventional measurement > 95 mm Hg). After 2 months, recordings were repeated with lisinopril 10 mg (n = 66) or 20 mg (n = 77) given once daily between 7 and 11 PM. Baseline-adjusted trough-to-peak ratios were determined from diurnal blood pressure profiles with an accuracy of 1 hour.

This open-label study in 19 patients with a variety of renal diseases with complicating hypertension investigated the effects of the ACEI, enalapril, on plasma hemoglobin and erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and 2, 60, and 120 days after starting enalapril treatment. By day 60 there was a significant decrease in the mean hemoglobin concentration (mean decrease of 7.4 g/l) that was maintained until day 120. Apart from a small but significant reduction by day 2, the plasma concentration mean EPO remained constant throughout the study. However, the magnitude of the decrease in hemoglobin concentration was significantly correlated with the initial plasma creatinine concentration and creatinine clearance. These results suggested that the degree of renal failure was important in determining the hematologic response to ACE inhibition. Although the mechanism of these changes remains unclear, our findings suggest that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, rather than decreasing EPO production, may reduce the hormone's erythropoietic activity.",0,0

Twenty-five patients with newly diagnosed or poorly regulated essential hypertension were treated with perindopril. Insufficient response to treatment (DBP > 90 mmHg) led to the addition of isradipine, and hydralazine was used as a tertiary agent if necessary. Gluteal subcutaneous biopsies were taken surgically at baseline and after 9 months of successful treatment. Two small resistance arteries were isolated and mounted on a small-vessel myograph, and the medium:lumen ratio (%) was measured under standardized conditions. Left ventricular mass was determined by echocardiography. Mean (SD) mean: lumen ratio decreased from 9.8 (2.6)% to 7.8 (1.9)% (p < 0.05), while left ventricular mass decreased from 299 (75) g 199 (53) g (p < 0.001).

Each drug therapy was administered for 4 weeks. The sequence of each treatment was randomly determined. Echocardiographic measurements and electrocardiograms were obtained only at the beginning of the study. Biochemical and 48-hour Holter measurements were obtained at the beginning and at the end of each treatment. All treatments resulted in a significant but similar decrease in blood pressure. In the complete group, diltiazem decreased ventricular premature complexes (PVCs) by 65% (p < 0.05) and metoprolol by 52% (p = 0.07). Enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect. In 12 patients with > or = 5 PCVs/hour at baseline, diltiazem and metoprolol reduced PCVs by 66% (p < 0.05). It is concluded that in hypertensive patients with moderate to severe LV hypertrophy, both diltiazem and metoprolol significantly reduce PCV.",0,0

Minor differences in blood pressure (BP) lowering effect and metabolic response were obtained with the ACE inhibitors studied; only lisinopril significantly improved glucose tolerance; neither drug modified blood lipids. The entire patient population showed only a slight reduction in post-load glucose 1 hour after treatment. However, the most obvious improvement in glucose tolerance was evident in hypertensive patients who were glucose intolerant and/or insulin resistant (GI/IR, 53.8% of all). This subgroup also showed a slight but not significant increase in HDL cholesterol and a decrease in triglyceride levels. Only a slight change or no change in plasma glucose, insulin and lipid values was observed in hypertensive patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and insulin sensitivity. These favorable effects were expressed only after ACE inhibitor monotherapy, but not when hydrochlorothiazide was added. The results indicate that the lack of stratification of hypertensive patients with respect to glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity could be a confounding factor in the evaluation of the metabolic effects of ACE inhibitors.",0,0

Relatively low doses of the acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) cyclooxygenase inhibitor are now used routinely in ischemic heart disease, the most important cause of heart failure. Therefore, we investigated the hemodynamic interaction between ASA and captopril in heart failure. In a randomized crossover study, 13 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) who were already receiving maintenance treatment with an ACE inhibitor received a single dose of 25 mg captopril combined with 236 mg ASA or placebo. Peripheral blood flow was studied noninvasively by venous occlusion plethysmography of calves. Liver blood flow was estimated from indocyanine green (ICG) clearance. Captopril administration alone significantly decreased blood pressure (BP) and ICG clearance. Calf blood flow remained unchanged. However, after arterial occlusion, blood flow to the hyperemic calf persisted longer. Captopril alone did not significantly change the plasma levels of the vasodilator prostaglandins PGI2 and PGE2 or the vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2 (TXA2). In contrast, captopril combined with ASA reduced the plasma levels of these vasoactive substances, with significant decreases in PGE2 and TXA2 compared with captopril alone, but the hemodynamic changes after captopril plus ASA were similar to those seen after captopril alone. A single antithrombotic dose of ASA (236 mg) in 13 patients with congestive heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV] undergoing chronic ACE inhibitor therapy had no discernible effect on hemodynamic status. .

Lipid Study with Isoptin Press.,,"Libretti, A; Catalano, M","Some antihypertensive drugs adversely affect the plasma lipid profile, and this should be taken into account when choosing treatment for hypertension because it may offset the beneficial blood pressure-lowering effect of these agents. In this study, the long-term effects of sustained-release (SR) verapamil 240 mg daily and enalapril 20 mg daily on plasma lipid levels were investigated in 931 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Patients whose blood pressure was not effectively lowered after at least 1 month of monotherapy had enalapril 20 mg once daily added to their verapamil treatment or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once daily added to their enalapril treatment. . Blood pressure and lipid profile were evaluated before and after 6 months of treatment. Of 864 evaluable patients, 563 patients (65.1%) were successfully treated with monotherapy and 220 patients (25.5%) required combination therapy. A total of 81 patients withdrew from the trial. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced with either verapamil or enalapril treatment, and heart rate was slightly but significantly reduced with both treatments. Both treatments significantly reduced total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoproteins. High-density lipoprotein levels were significantly increased in those receiving verapamil but not in those receiving enalapril. Adverse effects occurred in 37 (3.9%) patients receiving verapamil SR and 25 (2.7%) patients receiving enalapril. In conclusion, long-term treatment with the antihypertensive agents verapamil and enalapril, alone or in combination regimens, significantly improved the plasma lipid profile.

1275,7512487,"Reduce blood pressure. How far, how fast?",,"Roca-Cusachs, A","There is a general consensus that high blood pressure (BP) should be lowered gradually. A reduction in BP beyond the limits of the autoregulation curve can compromise perfusion of vital organs and cause organ ischemia. However, a reduction in high BP offers protection against cerebral events and some protection against coronary heart disease. The limited protection against coronary heart disease provided by BP reduction may be explained in part by the so-called ""J-shaped curve"": a reduction in diastolic blood pressure below 85 mmHg can lead to a paradoxical increase in coronary events, although this effect is by no means well established. Furthermore, the incidence of various events associated with cardiovascular disease peaks during the morning hours, at a time when some antihypertensive medications are less effective. This may also explain the limited coronary protection achieved after the administration of antihypertensive drugs.",0,0

We also observed echocardiographic improvement in left ventricular function, as well as clinical symptoms of congestive heart failure. Finally, we observed that there was an antiarrhythmic effect of enalapril in congestive heart failure. We think that the antiarrhythmic effect of enalapril in congestive heart failure was probably due to hemodynamic improvement.",0,0

1280,7516858,The clinical potential of renin inhibitors and angiotensin antagonists.,,"Cody, R J","The renin-angiotensin system is one of the main contributors to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases, such as congestive heart failure and hypertension. Therefore, attempts to specifically block this system have been a pharmacological goal for more than 25 years. Attempts have been made to block the renin system at 3 major sites: the rate-limiting angiotensinogen-renin pathway, the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and the active receptor sites for the end products of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Converting enzyme inhibitors have been studied and used successfully in clinical cardiovascular disorders, but questions remain regarding the specificity of their action. Therefore, other more specific approaches remain under evaluation. Inhibition of the action of renin on angiotensinogen was demonstrated with early inhibitory peptides and in experimental studies with specific antibodies. Most of the currently available renin inhibitors are non-peptide, which nevertheless require intravenous administration. An oral renin inhibitor with clinical effects was evaluated in the first human trials. Like renin inhibitors and ACE inhibitors, specific angiotensin antagonists have been studied early in the course of pharmacological blockade of the renin system. Early angiotensin antagonists were limited due to the need for intravenous administration and due to their short half-life. They also had the potential for mixed agonist/antagonist physiological and pharmacological effects, which could result in a pressor, rather than a depressor, response. Angiotensin receptor antagonists have the appeal of blocking the specific receptor at its target tissue site, analogous to other well-described systems. Newer angiotensin antagonists do not have the limitations of precursor peptides. Losartan (DUP753) is a specific antagonist of the angiotensin II AT1 receptor. It is orally effective with no agonist activity and has high receptor binding characteristics. Early studies indicate that it is a specific probe of the renin system and provide new insights into the role of the renin system in cardiovascular disorders. Emerging clinical studies indicate that it is effective in lowering blood pressure and as a vasodilator. Aldosterone antagonists, such as spironolactone, have been available for decades. Spironolactone is being used in an ongoing trial to assess the impact of combined aldosterone-converting enzyme inhibition. Newer aldosterone antagonists could be added to targeted aldosterone blockade without the adverse effects of the parent compound and the potential for combined specific blockade of the renin system.",0,0

1282,7521831,Race and hypertension. What is clinically relevant?,,"Rutledge, D R","Hypertension, once considered rare in Africa, occurs frequently in most black populations outside the continent, as well as in more urban areas of Africa. The prevalence of hypertension in black US citizens is among the highest in the world. Pathophysiologic mechanisms suggest that salt-sensitive blood pressure frequency is more common in black patients. More black than white patients initially present with volume expansion. However, in black patients there does not appear to be a significant relationship between plasma renin activity, plasma volume and blood pressure. Insulin resistance syndrome has also been reported in African Americans. Future studies need to address this issue, both because it relates to the identification of individuals at risk of developing high blood pressure and because it has implications for the initial selection of antihypertensive therapy. Hypertensive kidney disease is common in black people. Lowering blood pressure with diuretic-based therapies has not been shown to delay or prevent loss of kidney function in patients with this condition, suggesting that this treatment approach may not be optimal. Lifestyle modifications remain the initial therapeutic regimen. Because diuretics and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in controlled clinical trials, they are the preferred therapies. The Hypertension Screening and Follow-up Program showed significant reductions in morbidity and mortality in black patients using primarily diuretic-based therapies. However, controversy remains regarding the use of diuretics, as some investigators believe that greater reductions in overall cardiovascular risk may be achieved in black patients using other agents. These agents may have a beneficial cardiovascular effect in addition to and independently of their blood pressure-lowering effect. Long-term data documenting reduced rates of morbidity and mortality with other agents are needed for all populations, particularly in black hypertensive patients.",0,0
1283,7523058,Stress test in heart failure. A critical review.,,"Swedberg, K","Exercise intolerance is one of the main characteristics of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Therefore, stress testing has been widely used in the evaluation of patients with CHF, both to define the severity of the disease and to evaluate the efficacy of pharmaceutical agents in clinical trials. Several different exercise tests can be used, although the maximal exercise test is the most common. Maximal exercise capacity can be determined by measuring exercise duration during incremental exercise, or maximal oxygen (O2) consumption, or it can be estimated by anaerobic threshold. Although the initial stress test in patients with CHF accurately identifies and quantifies heart failure and determines prognosis, it is of limited value in evaluating changes that occur as a result of drug therapy. A key drawback of exercise testing as a measure of drug effect is the fact that changes in exercise produced by pharmacological intervention do not correlate well with changes in mortality rate. Several examples of the lack of correlation between exercise testing and mortality rates have been observed in clinical trials with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and vasodilators. ACE inhibitors have a modest effect on maximal exercise capacity but improve survival. Neuroendocrine activation is thought to more closely reflect mortality rates as well as changes in survival seen with pharmacological intervention compared with other modes of assessment.",0,0

Patients then discontinued therapy for 7 days, and then the cycle was repeated. Therapy continued until evidence of disease progression.; Forty-two patients have been enrolled in this trial with a minimum of 40 weeks of follow-up. Of 18 patients with measurable soft tissue disease, three demonstrated a complete response (CR) and six a partial response (PR) for more than 2 months.

Trandolaprilat inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and shows pharmacodynamic properties similar to other ACE inhibitors, improving hemodynamic and cardiac parameters in patients with essential hypertension. Trandolapril 2 to 4 mg once daily effectively controls blood pressure for at least 24 hours in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In a small number of double-blind comparative trials, trandolapril had antihypertensive efficacy similar to that of atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and sustained-release nifedipine, but was more effective than captopril. Combination therapy with trandolapril and sustained-release hydrochlorothiazide or nifedipine had a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either pharmacological treatment alone. Further comparative trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary findings. The tolerability profile of trandolapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors, most adverse events are generally mild and transient in nature, and trandolapril has no adverse effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Therefore, trandolapril, with its favorable pharmacological profile and antihypertensive activity similar to that of agents currently used to treat patients with mild to moderate hypertension, is likely to provide a well-tolerated option for the treatment of this disease. The results of ongoing and future clinical trials will determine its potential as a cardioprotective agent in patients after myocardial infarction.",0,0

1288,7527326,quinabril A reappraisal of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in cardiovascular disorders.,,"Plosker, G L; Sorkin, E M","After systemic absorption, quinapril is converted by de-esterification to quinaprilat (the active diacid metabolite), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Pharmacodynamic studies in animals indicate ACE inhibition both in plasma and in tissues, such as the arterial wall and heart, following administration of quinapril. Tissue inhibition of ACE may be an important component of the mechanism of action of quinapril (and other ACE inhibitors) in achieving favorable effects in cardiovascular disorders. Quinaprilat has a short elimination half-life (approximately 2 hours), but it binds potently to ACE and slowly dissociates from it, allowing administration of quinapril once or twice daily in the treatment of patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure. Quinapril 10 to 40 mg/day has achieved adequate control of blood pressure in the majority of patients with essential hypertension in clinical trials. Some patients required doses of quinapril up to 80 mg/day and/or concomitant diuretic therapy. Titration of quinapril doses from 10 to 40 mg/day increased response rates without increasing the incidence or severity of adverse events. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to quinapril treatment improved response rates by approximately 10% to 20% in patients with hypertension. In general, blood pressure control with quinapril monotherapy was similar to that achieved with enalapril or other standard antihypertensive agents in comparative trials. Quinapril < or = 40 mg/day improved exercise tolerance, reduced symptom severity and frequency, and improved functional class (New York Heart Association) in most clinical studies of patients with congestive heart failure. In addition, the beneficial hemodynamic and echocardiographic changes achieved with quinapril were maintained for up to 1 year with continuous administration to such patients, but its effect on survival in patients with congestive heart failure has not been reported. The tolerability profile of quinapril is very similar to that of other ACE inhibitors; Pooled data from clinical trials indicated that 12% of patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure who received quinapril experienced treatment-related adverse events compared with 15% of those who received enalapril and 16% of those who received captopril. Therefore, quinapril has clearly established a role as an effective and well-tolerated alternative to other ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Although the effects of quinapril on survival in patients with congestive heart failure have not been determined, large interventional studies have shown better mortality rates with other ACE inhibitors. Other studies, including a large ongoing trial of normotensive patients with coronary artery disease but normal left ventricular function, may also establish a role for quinapril in treating patients with ischemic heart disease.",0,0

Common carotid artery flow (+20 and +24%) also increased significantly, while the corresponding resistance (-18 and -26%) decreased significantly during the same period. Finally, CO was significantly redistributed to the brachial and, to a lesser extent, carotid vascular beds after both doses of lisinopril. We conclude that in healthy subjects, lisinopril, at non- or slightly hypotensive doses, dilates both arterioles and large arteries and that this vasodilation is not homogeneous, preferentially affecting the brachial vascular bed rather than the carotid one.",0,0

To assess the efficacy of GM-CSF and G-CSF in the treatment of drug-induced agranulocytosis, we have studied all reported cases (n = 70) treated with GM-CSF and G-CSF, including ten patients treated during the last 2 years in the Netherlands. The results demonstrate that patients with severe granulocytopenia (<0.1 x 10(9)/L) treated with hematopoietic growth factors had significantly faster recovery of peripheral blood granulocytes compared to previously published studies. At the same time, a significantly lower mortality rate was observed. In patients with severe granulocytopenia treated with GM-CSF or G-CSF, a mortality rate of 5% was observed. No differences in granulocyte recovery were observed in patients treated with GM-CSF or G-CSF. The results of this review indicate that G-CSF and GM-CSF enhance recovery of the myeloid lineage, resulting in faster normalization of peripheral blood granulocyte counts and a lower incidence of fatal complications.",0,0
1292,7533694,Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in Raynaud's phenomenon.,,"Challenor, V F","Patients with Raynaud's phenomenon exhibit reversible digital vasospasm, often in response to cold. Although this condition often responds to simple physical measures, in severe cases, the symptoms may require drug treatment. Arterial vasodilators have generally been tested in clinical practice, but recently ACE inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials for this condition. Case studies, non-comparative and placebo-controlled studies have shown mixed results of ACE inhibitor therapy in Raynaud's phenomenon. Although these drugs reduced symptoms in some patients, the results were not consistent. In objective measures of improvement, such as the evaluation of digital blood flow patterns, no consistent statistically significant changes have been shown either. However, well-conducted dose titration studies have not been performed in patients with Reynaud's phenomenon, and objective methods for evaluating this condition require refinement. The mode of action of ACE inhibitors is promising and these agents do not have significant adverse effects in this population. Although ACE inhibitors cannot currently be recommended for the routine treatment of Reynaud's phenomenon, further controlled studies with newer ACE inhibitors, which may have improved peripheral activity, may change this opinion.",0,0
1293,7537194,doxazosin. An update on its clinical pharmacology and therapeutic applications in hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia.,,"Fulton, B; Wagstaff, A J; Sorkin, E M","Doxazosin is a long-acting alpha 1 adrenergic receptor antagonist structurally related to prazosin and terazosin. Its antihypertensive effect is produced by a reduction in smooth muscle tone of peripheral vascular beds resulting in a decrease in total peripheral resistance with no significant effect on cardiac output or heart rate. In benign prostatic hyperplasia, the effect of doxazosin in relieving bladder outflow obstruction occurs through an alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade-mediated reduction in prostate tone. Doxazosin has been shown to be equally effective as the comparator drug in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. It has been used in a variety of patient populations, including the elderly, blacks, smokers, and patients with comorbidities such as renal dysfunction, hypercholesterolemia, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and respiratory disease. Doxazosin has also been used successfully in combination with beta adrenergic receptor antagonists, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with hypertension uncontrolled on monotherapy. Doxazosin has a beneficial effect on some of the risk factors associated with coronary heart disease, including elevated serum lipid levels, impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Modest decreases in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides are observed with doxazosin therapy, whereas small increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio are consistently reported. total cholesterol. Some studies have reported an improvement in glucose tolerance, although this effect has been seen more consistently in non-diabetic patients than in NIDDM patients. In addition, doxazosin produces a reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy similar to that of other antihypertensive agents. Model-based calculations suggest that doxazosin significantly reduces the risk of developing coronary heart disease in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, although this has yet to be confirmed in long-term prospective studies. Doxazosin appears to be a promising agent in the treatment of urinary symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. As with other alpha 1 adrenergic receptor antagonists, doxazosin treatment produces increases in peak and mean urinary flow rates and improves other objective and symptomatic measures.

The daily dose of enalapril was increased, if necessary, from 10 to 20 to 40 mg and that of nifedipine from 40 to 60 to 80 mg at 4-week intervals during the 12-week titration period. At weeks -6, -4, 0, 4, 8, and 12, blood pressure, 24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UAE), biochemical data, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity were measured in serum. blood samples were also taken to determine baseline concentrations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, renin, aldosterone, and serum insulin; At week 12, the mean daily dose of enalapril was 35 +/- 11.4 mg and 27 (57%) patients were receiving the maximum daily dose of 40 mg. In the nifedipine group, the mean daily drug dose was 50 +/- 12.9 mg, with 4 (8%) receiving the maximum daily dose of 80 mg. Despite a dose-dependent fall in serum ACE activity in the enalapril group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased by only 8 mmHg over the 12-week titration period compared with a decrease of 15, 18 and 19 mmHg at weeks 0, 4, and 12, respectively, in the nifedipine group (P = 0.01 between groups). In the enalapril group, changes in MAP between weeks 0 and 12 were significantly correlated with baseline plasma glucose (r = 0.45, P = 0.001) and aldosterone concentrations (r = -0.32, P = 0.02) and the UAE (r = 0.3, P = 0.04). There was no statistically significant correlation between changes in MAP and baseline plasma renin concentration. In multivariate analysis, baseline renal function, glycemic control, and plasma aldosterone and serum insulin concentrations were independently associated with changes in blood pressure in enalapril-treated patients. No such statistical associations were seen in the nifedipine group.; In hypertensive patients with NIDDM, the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, serum insulin level, glycemic control, renal function, and proteinuria may be important determinants of blood pressure response to ACE inhibition.

Sodium and fluid retention is a well-documented phenomenon in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), but it is not known whether alterations in cortisol metabolism associated with diabetes contribute to its pathogenesis. Therefore, we evaluated some aspects of cortisol metabolism by measuring urinary metabolites of cortisol and cortisone in eight microalbuminuric and eight normoalbuminuric IDDM patients and eight matched control subjects. In both IDDM groups, nocturnal excretion of tetrahydrocortisol (THF), allo-tetrahydrocortisol (allo-THF), and tetrahydrocortisone (THE) was lower than in the control group (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). Both the allo-THF/THF ratio, a parameter of 5 alpha/5 beta cortisol reduction, and the cortisol to cortisone metabolite ratio (THF+allo-THF/THE), reflecting the general direction of cortisol interconversion to cortisone, were lower in the IDDM groups (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). In combined subjects (n = 24), allo-THF, allo-THF/THF, and THF+allo-THF/THE were inversely correlated with hemoglobin A1c (r = -0.69, P < 0.001; r = -0 .61, P < 0.01 and r = -0.58, P < 0.01, respectively). Segmental upper arm blood volume, estimated using an electrical impedance technique, was positively correlated with cortisol to cortisone metabolite ratio in both control subjects (r = 0.77; P < 0.05 ) as in the patients with IDDM in whom it was measured (r = 0.56). ; P < 0.05; n = 13), while the regression line shifted to the left in IDDM (ie, lower ratio with the same blood volume; P < 0.03, by analysis of covariance). In seven microalbuminuric IDDM patients, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (10 mg daily for 6 to 12 weeks) resulted in a moderate additional decrease in the ratio of cortisol to cortisone metabolite (P < 0.05) . Current data suggest a chronic hyperglycemia-related impairment in corticosteroid reduction to tetrahydro metabolites and an imbalance in 11 beta HSD. Altered 11 beta HSD activity is unlikely to be primarily responsible for sodium and fluid retention in IDDM. Furthermore, an effect on 11 beta HSD activity could provide an additional mechanism of action of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.",0,0

After 12 weeks of treatment, the improvement in treadmill exercise duration was greater in the lisinopril group (113 seconds) compared to the placebo group (86 seconds). This improvement in exercise duration was particularly evident in patients with left ventricular ejection fractions less than 35% (lisinopril = 130 seconds; placebo = 94 seconds). In patients who received lisinopril, the increase in exercise duration was accompanied by an improvement in quality of life as measured by the Yale dyspnea/fatigue index and in signs and symptoms of heart failure. In addition, the lisinopril group had a greater mean increase (3.7%) in left ventricular ejection fraction compared to the placebo group (1.3%).

Sixty-nine percent of subjects increased (""excretors"") and 31% decreased (""retainers"") their sodium excretion under stress. In addition to increased potassium excretion (p < 0.006), excretors also reported less stress-associated increase in systolic (p = 0.055) and diastolic (p = 0.040) blood pressure and showed greater expression of anger (p < 0.02) than retainers. . The same subjects were also studied for the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (captopril 25 mg twice daily) on sodium excretion. With captopril, excretors now showed retention of sodium (p < 0.001) and potassium (p < 0.01) under stress and no longer differed significantly in blood pressure reactivity. The results suggest that there are two different stress-related patterns of renal sodium excretion, that these patterns are related to blood pressure responses to stress, and that these patterns may be related to the expression of anger.

In each patient, a euglycemic glucose clamp with simultaneous indirect calorimetry allowed us to determine whole-body glucose disposal and substrate oxidation. Changes in morning SBP and DBP were also determined. Lisinopril versus placebo significantly improved whole body glucose disposal (40.4 +/- 0.4 versus 30.3 +/- 0.4 mumol/kg LBM x min; P < 0.01), the nonoxidative glucose metabolism (18.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 10.9 +/- 0.6 mumol/kg LBM x min; P < 0.01) and fasting plasma potassium levels (4 .8 +/- 3 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.4 mmol/L, P < 0.05).

After a single-blind placebo trial period, 611 patients were randomized to receive ramipril (n = 209), piretanide (n = 201), or combination therapy (n = 201). At the time of randomization, the three groups had the same characteristics (51% men, age 55 +/- 10 years, BP 165 +/- 18/104 +/- 6 mm Hg). At 4 weeks, BP decreased more with combination therapy than with monotherapy.

Previous left ventricular and echocardiographic studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy limits left ventricular dilatation, particularly in patients with anterior wall acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or impaired left ventricular function. Forty-three patients with acute Q-wave AMI were randomized within 24 hours of symptom onset to receive intravenous enalaprilat (1 mg) or placebo. The patients then received the corresponding oral therapy and were followed up for 1 month. Pre-drug and 1-month blood pool scans were obtained in 32 patients to assess changes in cardiac volumes and ejection fraction. Twenty-three patients underwent MRI at 1 month to assess left ventricular infarct expansion. Blood pressure decreased at 6 hours but returned to baseline in both groups after 1 month of therapy. The change in cardiac volumes from baseline to 1 month differed between placebo (end-diastolic volume +16 +/- 5 mL, end-systolic volume +8 +/- 6 mL) and enalapril (end-diastolic volume -8 +/- 9 mL and end-systolic volume -14 +/- 7 ml) (p < 0.05 vs. placebo).

Patients were treated with 3 million units (MU), daily or every other day, of recombinant interferon-alpha 2a (35 patients) or natural interferon-beta (3 patients). Treatment duration ranged from 6 to 15 months; the total duration of follow-up, even after therapy, ranged from 8 to 93 months; None of the 35 patients treated with interferon alone developed significant hematologic abnormalities. Furthermore, none of the 7 patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors alone showed haematological toxicity. Three patients who were treated with a combination of interferon and ACE inhibitors developed severe granulocytopenia within a few days of starting treatment. The granulocytopenia resolved within 1 to 2 weeks after stopping treatment. Resumption of treatment with this combination of drugs produced a relapse of granulocytopenia in 1 patient. In these 3 patients, treatment with interferon alone or ACE inhibitor monotherapy was not followed by granulocytopenia; Although severe hematologic toxicity rarely develops in patients treated with low-dose interferon, granulocytopenia occurred in all 3 patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia who were treated with a combination of low-dose interferon-alpha 2a and ACE inhibitors. No single drug was toxic in any of our patients with cryoglobulinemia, indicating a high risk of serious hematologic toxicity for this combination of drugs, at least in patients with this disease.

Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, plasma glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose load (75 g), lipid profile, and urinary albumin excretion were assessed before and after administration of quinapril for 8 weeks. (10 to 40 mg/day). Quinapril produced a significant and comparable reduction in blood pressure in both groups. Mean arterial pressure decreased from 114.8 +/- 0.9 to 94.2 +/- 1.1 (-17.9 +/- 1.5%) in the essential hypertensive group and from 118.4 + /- 1.6 to 96.2 +/- 1.4 (-18.4 +/- 1.6%) in the hypertensive diabetic group. In both essential hypertensive and diabetic-hypertensive subjects with microalbuminuria, quinapril significantly and comparably reduced urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE); UAE decreased from 32.5 +/- 5.5 micrograms/min to 14.7 +/- 3.7 micrograms/min (P < 0.05 from baseline) in the diabetic and hypertensive group and from 27 .5 +/- 3.0 micrograms/min to 11.6 +/- 2.7 micrograms/min (p < 0.05 v baseline) in essential hypertensives. Overall, a direct correlation was found between the initial level of EAU and the reduction in EAU after quinapril (delta EAU) (r = 0.706, p < 0.05).

As a result, morbidity and mortality from cardiomyopathy are likely to be increased in patients with generalized myopathies. One hundred consecutive patients with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy and a mean age of 17.2 years (range, 5-41) met criteria for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and received digitalis and diuretics. Nine of the 14 patients were symptom-free, despite left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) of 25-40%. The five patients with symptomatic heart failure had severe ventricular dilatation, with LVEF <25%. Two of the five patients died of heart failure within 1 year. For the remaining three patients, the addition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and, subsequently, the use of beta-blockers to the therapeutic regimen were evaluated. The addition of these medications, never before attempted in the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with generalized myopathic disease, complemented each other in relieving symptoms and reversing signs of congestive heart failure and DCM.

The rate of decline was faster in participants with ADPKD than in people with other diagnoses, reflecting, in part, faster disease progression in the ADPKD group. Baseline characteristics that predicted a more rapid rate of GFR decline in people with ADPKD were higher serum creatinine (independent of GFR), higher urinary protein excretion, higher mean arterial pressure (MAP), and younger age. In patients with baseline GFR values between 25 and 55 mL/min per 1.73 m2, neither assignment to a low-protein diet group nor assignment to a low blood pressure group significantly reduced the rate of decline in GFR. in participants with ADPKD. Similarly, the decrease in GFR was not related to protein intake achieved or MAP. In participants with GFR values between 13 and 24 mL/min per 1.73 m2, assignment to the low MAP group led to a somewhat more rapid decline in GFR. However, the more rapid decline in GFR did not appear to be due to a detrimental effect of low blood pressure or the antihypertensive agents used to achieve the low blood pressure goal. Lower protein intake, but not amino acid and keto acid supplement prescription, was marginally associated with slower kidney disease progression.",0,0

Captopril 25 mg (or placebo) was administered twice, ie in the evening (10 pm) and the next morning (8 am), before a maximal symptom-limited cycling exercise test (11 am). Captopril lowered resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p < 0.01) without causing reflex tachycardia. Time to onset of ST depression was prolonged (p < 0.05) and peak ST depression was reduced (p < 0.02). No differences were found between captopril and placebo in total exercise duration or time to angina onset. The effects of captopril on exercise-induced ischemia were most clearly demonstrated in patients who responded with a fall of more than 10 mm Hg in resting systolic blood pressure. In conclusion, this study suggests that captopril has anti-ischemic properties, which may be important in the treatment of patients with chronic stable angina and normal left ventricular function. These beneficial effects are probably related to a reduction in myocardial wall stress and afterload and thus a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand.",0,0
1323,7585774,Post-myocardial infarction angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Young, J B","Results from SOLVD, SAVE, AIRE, GISSI-III, ISIS-IV, and the Chinese Captopril Trial suggest that ACE inhibitor therapy, at least with enalapril, captopril, ramipril, and lisinopril, induces a significant reduction in rates of morbidity and mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and a wide range of ventricular function and myocardial infarction. The results of SOLVD and SAVE, in particular, demonstrate better survival and a reduction in major ischemic events in patients with depressed systolic ventricular function. SOLVD notes that institution of ACE inhibitor therapy need not be done immediately after a myocardial infarction to benefit. GISSI-III and ISIS-IV, on the other hand, suggest that the use of ACE inhibitor drugs in the early stages of myocardial infarction produces significant, albeit small, benefits when the drugs are started in the early stages after the event together with with other routinely used therapeutic strategies. The prospective, well-designed, and well-controlled nature of these clinical trials, the consistency of their findings, and the high level of morbidity and mortality in the placebo groups establish the importance of preventing ischemic events with prescribed ACE inhibitors. Of particular importance is the fact that none of these clinical trials were designed to determine the optimal dose or frequency of administration of the chosen ACE inhibitors. Target dose principles were used and clinicians wishing to generate similar results in their own patient population should choose one of the studied ACE inhibitors and administer it as described in the hope of achieving similar results as detailed in clinical trials. summarized. Finally, recommendations regarding post-myocardial infarction therapy with ACE inhibitors can be summarized. Patients with acute or remote myocardial infarction should have an evaluation of ventricular function. All patients with depressed systolic function, whether or not they are symptomatic, should receive a trial of an appropriate ACE inhibitor. Patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction should have their ventricular function evaluated early and, if the ejection fraction is low (probably < 50%), an ACE inhibitor of appropriate choice should be started after 24 hours have elapsed. ACE inhibitor therapy should be initiated in combination with other proven and effective post-myocardial infarction treatment strategies. In patients with normal systolic function, the benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy are less clear, but patients with large anterior wall myocardial infarction are likely to benefit, even without objective evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Concomitant use of thrombolytic agents, aspirin, and beta-blockers should not preclude the use of ACE inhibitor therapy.",0,0

In this double-blind study, 13 patients were randomized to receive captopril, 12 patients received enalapril, and 11 patients received placebo, for 12 months. In patients receiving placebo, acute myocardial infarction was associated with activation of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems, and with stimulation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide levels. ACE inhibition did not significantly alter circulating levels of norepinephrine, brain natriuretic peptide, or atrial natriuretic peptide. Compared to placebo, enalapril induced a strong decrease in plasma ACE activity and both ACE inhibitors reduced plasma angiotensin II levels. Using pooled data, circulating brain natriuretic peptide levels at sampling time zero were significantly higher than atrial natriuretic peptide values. Brain natriuretic peptide levels at 72 h were significantly correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction of the radionuclide measured 5 days and 3 months after infarction. Similar associations were seen for atrial natriuretic peptide and norepinephrine. We confirm the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system after an acute myocardial infarction. Atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide and sympathetic nervous system responses to acute myocardial infarction were not significantly altered by ACE inhibition.

Pressure angiographic data were obtained from 16 patients with overt heart failure and 47 without heart failure. Repeat studies were performed in 41 patients after 1 year of treatment with enalapril or placebo. Left ventricular silhouettes were divided into 18 segments to estimate regional ejection fraction, wall stress, and myocardial damage (% myocardial damage). Contractile status was assessed and classified by ejection rate-preload-afterload relationships and by a scoring method based on 10 parameters of myocardial and ventricular function. End-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (EDV, ESV) were significantly higher (P < 0.001), ejection fraction (EF) lower (P < 0.009), % myocardial damage higher (P < 0.008), and contractile state more depressed in the patients with overt heart failure. Changes in EDV and ESV (delta placebo vs. delta enalapril) were significant (delta EDV, P < 0.003; delta ESV, P < 0.014). Directional changes in diastolic pressure-volume relationships with enalapril or placebo were primarily dependent on baseline contractile state and diastolic volume range. The best individual predictors of post-treatment EF were index score (a surrogate parameter for contractile status) and VSE. Additional benefits of enalapril include prevention of further dilation in patients with less depressed contractile status and delay in the onset of heart failure.

These falls were significantly greater than with either drug alone and greater than the sum of the falls when the individual drugs were taken. The combination of amlodipine and ACE inhibitor was also additive. Both combinations with amlodipine were well tolerated by all patients.; The combination of alpha-blockers and calcium antagonists has not been studied previously and should be useful for resistant hypertensives who have not tolerated beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors. The combination of ACE inhibition and calcium antagonism has previously been shown to be additive; its use as a positive control in the present studies suggests that the use of an active drug during a run-in period may be a useful design to allow the study of patients from whom all treatment cannot be safely withdrawn.",0,0

Each treatment was administered for 4 weeks, and treatments were separated by a 3-week placebo period. At the end of the last phase of treatment, sinorphan was combined with captopril for an additional 4 weeks. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure changes were monitored by repeated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.; When given as monotherapy for 4 weeks, neither sinorphan nor captopril significantly reduced 24-hour or 14-hour mean daytime SBP or DBP. However, a significant decrease in DBP was observed during the first 6 h after morning administration of captopril. With sinorphan only a significant decrease in nocturnal SBP was found. With the combined therapy of sinorphan and captopril, significant decreases were observed in both SBP and DBP, which were maintained for 24 h. After 4 weeks of sinorphan alone or in combination with captopril, no change in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide level was found. However, urinary excretion of cyclic GMP was transiently increased after administration of the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor; Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase with sinorphan has a limited effect on blood pressure in hypertensive patients when given alone. However, the simultaneous inhibition of neutral endopeptidase and ACE induces a synergistic effect and could therefore represent an interesting new therapeutic approach for the treatment of essential hypertension.",0,0

1336,7599749,Neurohormonal activation in patients with acute myocardial infarction or chronic congestive heart failure. With special reference to treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Sigurdsson, A","Neurohormonal activation may provide a pathophysiological link between acute myocardial infarction and chronic congestive heart failure, and modulation of neurohormonal activity may be an important therapeutic target in these conditions. Plasma neurohormones were studied in 55 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Angiotensin II, norepinephrine, and ANP were elevated in the initial phase but tended to normalize during the first week in patients without signs of heart failure. In patients with heart failure, angiotensin II and norepinephrine remained elevated for 1 month and ANP for 4-6 months. During head-up tilt, angiotensin II and norepinephrine increased more in patients with heart failure. In patients with a first myocardial infarction, there was a positive correlation between sustained neurohormonal activity and infarct size. Nearly complete suppression of plasma ACE activity was achieved within 30 min in 48 patients treated with intravenous enalaprilat, started within 24 h of infarction onset. The drug was tolerated in doses of 1.0 to 1.2 mg given over 1 to 2 hours. Patients with systolic blood pressure between 100 and 110 mmHg had a higher risk of hypotension than those with higher blood pressure at baseline. Tolerance was not worse among patients treated with intravenous diuretics, metoprolol, or nitroglycerin. A total of 98 patients were randomized to treatment with enalapril or placebo, started within 24 hours of infarction onset and continued for 4-6 months. During treatment there were no significant differences in plasma levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone, ANP or catecholamines between groups. Echocardiographic recordings were made in 28 patients. Among patients receiving placebo, there was a positive correlation between plasma norepinephrine levels on days 5 to 7 and increased left ventricular volumes during the study period, and an inverse correlation between plasma aldosterone on days 5 to 7 and increased ejection from the left ventricle. fraction during the study. No such correlation was found among patients taking enalapril. ANP levels at one month were inversely correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction at the same time. Plasma neurohormones were measured in 223 patients with mild or moderately severe chronic heart failure, randomized to receive treatment with ramipril or placebo for 3 months. There was a wide variation in hormone levels. Norepinephrine and aldosterone were inversely correlated with exercise duration at baseline. Norepinephrine was positively correlated with the degree of symptoms. Aldosterone and ANP were reduced with ramipril compared to placebo. Norepinephrine was reduced among patients with baseline levels in the highest tertile. Plasma hormones were also measured at maximal exercise in 54 patients. Hormone levels at rest were strongly correlated with those at maximal exercise. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0,0

1338,7601014,Spiral. A preliminary review of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of hypertension.,,"Noble, S; Sorkin, E M","Spirapril is a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prodrug that is converted to the active metabolite spiraprilat after oral administration and has been evaluated primarily for the treatment of hypertension. In dose-finding studies of patients with mild to severe hypertension, spirapril > or = 6 mg once daily produced reductions in blood pressure of approximately 10 to 18 mm Hg (systolic) and 7 to 13 mm Hg (diastolic) [ 24 hours post dose trough readings at end of treatment period]. Normalization of blood pressure (minimum diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) had occurred in 29 to 50% of patients at the end of these investigations. The dose-response curve for spirapril appears flat for doses of 6 to 24 mg once daily. Comparisons with other ACE inhibitors are limited in number and further studies are required before the relative antihypertensive efficacy of spirapril can be fully assessed. However, in individual well-controlled clinical trials, spirapril produced similar reductions in blood pressure as those seen with enalapril or captopril. When given as monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, spirapril may offer potential advantages over the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine. Spirapril is generally well tolerated and has an adverse event profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Data from small studies suggest that spirapril can be used without dose adjustment in patients with renal insufficiency, as a consequence of its dual mechanisms of renal and hepatic elimination. This is in contrast to most ACE inhibitors, which are eliminated by a predominantly renal mechanism resulting in accumulation of the active metabolite when renal function is impaired. However, the usefulness of spirapril in this group of patients remains to be fully determined due to conflicting data regarding its effects on renal function. Therefore, spirapril is an effective antihypertensive agent that is well tolerated. Further comparative trials are needed to fully determine its efficacy relative to other ACE inhibitors, and a better understanding of its effects on renal function will clarify its role in hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency.",0,0

The Trandolapril Multicenter Study Group.,,"Weir, M R; Gray, J M; Paster, R; Saunders, E","The antihypertensive effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril given at doses of 1, 2, and 4 mg/day was compared in 207 Caucasian and 91 Black patients with mild to moderate hypertension after a double-blind study. , randomized and placebo-controlled. , parallel study design. Trandolapril is a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed to its active diacid metabolite, trandolaprilat. After 6 weeks of double-blind treatment, trandolapril reduced initial sitting diastolic pressure in black and white patients. A comparison of the antihypertensive response of the two populations revealed that black patients required two to four times the dose of trandolapril to obtain a response similar to that seen in white patients. A 1 mg/day dose of trandolapril resulted in a mean decrease of 6.1 mm Hg in baseline sitting diastolic pressure for Caucasian patients; a similar response (-6.5 mm Hg) was seen in black patients at 4 mg/d. In contrast to population differences in blood pressure, decreases in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity were similar for both populations. An evaluation of trandolaprilat levels revealed no racial differences in the concentrations of trandolaprilat required to achieve a given degree of ACE inhibition. Therefore, it appears that the antihypertensive response of black patients is not fully explained by a reduction in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. The lack of response at a lower dose but an increased response at a higher dose could reflect other vasodepressor activity of trandolapril or simply be evidence of reduced sensitivity of high blood pressure in blacks to converting enzyme inhibition. of angiotensin.",0,0

In multivariate models, both peptides added prognostic information to that obtained from clinical evaluation, but not to that obtained from left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Estimation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve showed comparable prognostic accuracy for LVEF (0.7788), plasma ANF (0.7795), plasma endothelin (0.7493), and Killip classification (0.8203), which means that for all these prognostic indicators, the patient selected from the group of patients who die will have a higher test value than that of a patient randomly selected from the group of surviving patients 75% to 82% of the time. The clinical utility of neurohumoral measurement in routine risk stratification after AMI appears limited, as no additional prognostic information is obtained beyond that provided by objective assessment of LV systolic function.

They received three doses of enalapril, each for 3 weeks; the dose at admission (mean 10 mg daily); double this dose (mean 20 mg daily); and half this dose (mean 5 mg daily). 2. Cough response to inhaled capsaicin was also measured in two control groups: hypertensive patients on long-term enalapril therapy without cough (n = 18) and hypertensive patients taking nifedipine (n = 17). 3. In patients with enalapril-induced cough, there were significant enalapril dose responses with respect to cough severity (P < 0.05) and nocturnal cough awakenings (P < 0.05), but not for frequency of cough Although the cough was less severe (P < 0.02) and caused fewer nocturnal awakenings (P < 0.03) with the lower dose of enalapril (mean 5 mg per day), it did not completely disappear in any patient. 4. Sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin did not differ significantly between the three doses of enalapril. The relative potency of capsaicin in enalapril 20 mg compared to enalapril 5 mg was 1.0 (95% CI 0.4 to 2.2). The wide confidence limits indicate that an important dose-dependent change in capsaicin sensitivity is not excluded. 5. Sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin differed significantly between patients with enalapril-induced cough and both control groups. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED IN 250 WORDS)",0,0
1354,7624954,Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme in the treatment of erythrocytosis in kidney transplants. Clinical experience and observation of the mechanism.,,"Danovitch, G M; Jamgotchian, N J; Eggena, P H; Paul, W; Barrett, J D; Wilkinson, A; Lee, D B","Recent observations indicate that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition corrects renal transplant erythrocytosis (RTE). The mechanism of this association is not known. We examined the effect of ACE inhibition on hematocrit, erythropoietin (EPO), and renin substrate. ACE inhibition has been reported to suppress renin substrate, which is known to stimulate EPO and erythropoiesis. In 15 patients with STR, the hematocrit decreased from 52.8 +/- 0.6 (SEM) to 45.8 +/- 1.4% after 8 weeks of treatment with Enalapril, 2.5-20 mg/ day. Serum EPO (normal range: 9-30 mU/ml) was high in one, normal in seven, and low in seven patients. ACE inhibition reduced EPO in patients with high or normal baseline levels, but did not induce any change in patients with low baseline levels. ACE inhibition had no significant effect on renin substrate. In a patient who rejected his first graft, erythrocytosis recurred after a second successful transplant. Treatment was discontinued due to cough in two patients and symptomatic drop in blood pressure in one patient. We conclude that TEN is not caused by hypererythropoietinemia. In patients with normal circulating EPO, erythrocytosis may be due to increased sensitivity to EPO, and ACE inhibition lowers hematocrit due to further reduction of this hormone. However, the finding of erythrocytosis in half of our patients with suppressed EPO suggests the involvement of mechanisms not mediated by EPO. The recurrence of TER in a patient after a second transplant raises the additional possibility of patient-specific factors in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Unlike other reports, we documented side effects (cough, hypotension) in three (20%) of our patients. Our clinical experience, coupled with previous reports of spontaneous resolution of ERT in some patients, suggests that intermittent courses of ACE inhibition may be the optimal strategy in the use of this form of therapy for ERT.",0,0

We studied the distribution of prognostic factors and survival in eligible patients from a multicenter trial of long-term oral anticoagulant therapy after myocardial infarction. All hospital survivors of myocardial infarction at a clinical center participating in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of long-term anticoagulation therapy after myocardial infarction were selected for entry criteria. Subsequently, the prognostic factors and survival of the participants were compared with eligible but non-randomized patients. The 350 participants were younger and more often male and more often smokers compared to 587 non-participants. Non-participants more often had a prior myocardial infarction and were treated more often with diuretics and ACE inhibitors, suggesting a higher proportion of patients with chronic heart failure in this group. Age, prior myocardial infarction, and use of diuretics at discharge were independent predictors of mortality; consent showed no association. Our findings indicate that clinical trial participants have a better prognosis during the first years after myocardial infarction compared with eligible non-participants as a result of a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors associated with mortality in non-participants. .",0,0

1363,7641605,Guillain Barre syndrome. Clinical manifestations and treatment indications.,,"Rees, J","Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is the most common cause of acute neuromuscular paralysis in the developed world today. Patients most often present with rapidly ascending paralysis along with sensory symptoms and variable autonomic involvement. Diagnosis is clinical, but lumbar puncture and nerve conduction studies are helpful in excluding other conditions. The improvement in prognosis in recent years is largely due to advances in the management of respiratory intensive care. Careful monitoring of cardiorespiratory function and, in particular, periodic vital capacity measurements will help predict which patients will require elective ventilation to prevent impending neuromuscular respiratory failure. The paralyzed patient is susceptible to all the complications of immobility, particularly venous thromboembolism and hypostatic pneumonia, so good nursing care and physiotherapy are essential. Autonomic involvement can predispose to cardiac arrhythmias and labile blood pressure. The prolonged nature of the illness predisposes to psychiatric complications, particularly depression, and this should be treated appropriately. The specific treatment is aimed at reducing the period of maximum disability. Both plasma exchange (PE) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) have been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials. A multicenter trial is currently underway to determine whether PE or IVIg or PE followed by IVIg is the most effective treatment for this condition. Steroids alone have not been shown to be of value, although a trial comparing the combination of IVIg and methylprednisolone with IVIg alone is underway. The prognosis for GBS is generally good, with around 80% of patients making a full recovery, although around 5% die from complications. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED IN 250 WORDS)",0,0

It is not known whether this initial phenomenon is reversible (hemodynamic) or irreversible (structural damage) after prolonged hypertension. To elucidate these mechanisms, we investigated 42 hypertensive IDDM patients (16F/26M, age 40 +/- 7 years, mean +/- SD) with ND receiving AHT (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, N = 30) during 6 (2 to 15) years [median (range)]. GFR (ml/min/1.73m2), blood pressure (BP, mm Hg), and albuminuria (mg/24 h) were measured on the last day of HT and one month after HT withdrawal. All measured variables were significantly elevated after AHT withdrawal: GFR [mean (SEM)] 76 (4) to 81 (4) (P < 0.0001), PA [mean (SEM)] 140/82 (2 /1) to 151/89 (2/1) (P < 0.0005) and albuminuria [geometric mean (antilog SEM)] from 704 (1.2) to 1122 (1.2) (P < 0.0001) . A correlation was found between the relative increase in systolic blood pressure (delta Sys%) and the relative change in GFR (delta GFR%) (r = 0.44, P < 0.005). Our results partially support the hypothesis that the faster initial decline in GFR is due to a functional (hemodynamic) effect of HT, which is not attenuated over time, while the later slower decline reflects the beneficial effect on the progression of diabetic nephropathy.",0,0

However, there is evidence that the benefits associated with a patent ARF are disproportionate to the observed improvement in ventricular function and may result not only from rescue of the ischemic myocardium but also from the opening of ARF beyond a narrow time window. post-infarction. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the effect of IRA patency on the outcome of patients after acute MI with left ventricular dysfunction while controlling for differences in left ventricular ejection fraction and extension of coronary heart disease and (2) to determine the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy in patients with patent and occluded infarct arteries; The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study included 2,231 patients with a documented myocardial infarction and a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%. They were randomized to the ACE inhibitor captopril (50 mg TID) or placebo 3 to 16 days after MI and followed for a mean of 3.5 years. Left ventricular ejection fraction, measured by radionuclide left ventriculography, was repeated at the end of the follow-up period. The 946 patients in whom AKI patency was established prior to randomization form the basis of this study. At cardiac catheterization averaging 4.2 days after infarction, 30.7% of patients had an initially occluded ARF. After revascularization, 162 of 946 patients (17.1%) had an occluded ARF at the time of randomization. The 162 patients with persistently occluded ARF and the 784 with patent ARF had similar baseline clinical characteristics, but those with occluded arteries had a slightly lower ejection fraction than the 784 patients with patent infarct arteries (30% versus 32%, P = 0.01). Cox proportional hazards analyzes showed that independent predictors of all-cause mortality were hypertension (relative risk [RR] 1.94, P < 0.001), number of diseased coronary arteries (RR 1.68, P < 0.001) , occluded ARF (RR 1.49, p = 0.039), ejection fraction (RR 1.36, p < 0.001), age (RR 1.10, p = 0.030), and use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (RR 0 .60, p = 0.007). Independent predictors of a composite endpoint consisting of cardiovascular mortality, morbidity, or ejection fraction reduction of > or = 9 units were occluded IRA (odds ratio [OR] 1.73, P = .002), hypertension (OR 1, 71, P < 0.002). 001), number of diseased vessels (OR 1.38, P < 0.001), ejection fraction (OR 1.18, P = 0.003), use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (OR 0.67, P = 0.007 ) and randomization for captopril (OR 0.70, p = 0.009); AKI patency within 16 days of MI predicts a favorable clinical outcome, regardless of the number of obstructed coronary arteries or left ventricular function.

Four phases were performed: 2 weeks placebo, 8 weeks maintenance (perindopril or amlodipine), and 2 weeks washout between treatment periods. Ten hypertensive patients with stable renal allograft function transplanted more than 6 months ago and receiving cyclosporine as part of their immunosuppressive regimen were studied.

In a population-based case-control study that included 440 renal cell cancer cases, spouses of an additional 151 cases, and 691 controls, we evaluated the risk of renal cell cancer associated with hypertension and the use of diuretics and other medications. antihypertensives. The risks increased with the use of diuretics or other drugs that lower blood pressure, especially among people who reported no history of hypertension. After adjustment for hypertension, the use of diuretics alone was associated with a 40% excess risk (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 0.8-2.2), while the use of other antihypertensive drugs it was associated with a twofold risk (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.2-3.3). The excess risk was not restricted to any specific product, and no trend was observed with estimated lifetime consumption of any product. Furthermore, the risk was not potentiated by the presence of both hypertension and the use of antihypertensive drugs. Among people not using antihypertensive medications, a history of hypertension was associated with a significant 40-50% increased risk of renal cell cancer. Exclusion of subjects with hypertension diagnosed within 5 years of cancer diagnosis or interview had only a small effect on risk. These findings suggest small effects on the risk of renal cell cancer associated with hypertensive disease and with the use of diuretics and other antihypertensive drugs, but separate effects are difficult to disentangle due to possible misclassification of highly correlated events.

1375,7657848,multicenter comparison of the adverse reaction profiles of isradipine and enalapril at equipotent doses in patients with essential hypertension.,,"Johnson, B F; Eisner, G M; McMahon, F G; Jain, A K; Rudd, P; Sowers, J R","multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial compared the safety and efficacy of the dihydropyridine isradipine with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril administered twice daily for mild hypertension. 160 patients received isradipine (from 1.25 mg twice daily) or enalapril (from 2.5 mg twice daily) for 10 weeks. The dose was increased if the mean seated diastolic blood pressure was > 90 mm Hg. Significantly greater mean reductions in systolic blood pressure were observed after 2, 6, and 8 weeks of isradipine. However, at the end of the trial, 83% of patients receiving isradipine and 78% of those receiving enalapril showed a decrease of at least 5 mm Hg in sitting diastolic blood pressure to less than 96 mm Hg . Possible or probable drug-related adverse events were reported in 36% of patients who had a good antihypertensive response to isradipine and in 30% of those who responded to enalapril. There was a trend toward lower frequency of adverse events in isradipine non-responders (25%) and higher frequency in enalapril non-responders (43%). Pruritus, dizziness, edema, and fatigue were reported more frequently with isradipine, and cough and changes in bowel habits were more common with enalapril. The relationship between the pattern of adverse effects and the degree of blood pressure reduction may depend on the mechanism of action of a drug. In responders, isradipine and enalapril showed different patterns but a similar overall incidence of adverse effects.",1,0
1376,7661384,comparative study of captopril and enalapril on endothelial cell function in patients with congestive heart failure.,,"Bridges, A B; McLaren, M; Belch, J J","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce the incidence of future coronary artery thrombosis in patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction. A possible prothrombotic role of the angiotensin system has been postulated, and a recent study has provided support for this which showed that an angiotensin infusion increases levels of the prothrombotic plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI). In the present study, the authors investigated the effect of two ACE inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and PAI in 33 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Blood samples were obtained before treatment and then at weeks 1, 12, and 24 after initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy to measure tPA and PAI antigen activity levels. The results of the study indicated that the initiation of ACE inhibitors had no significant effect on tPA or PAI antigen activity levels at the time points studied, and no significant differences between captopril and enalapril were demonstrated. The results therefore suggest that ACE inhibitors do not affect tPA or PAI antigen activity in CHF patients and thus another mechanism is likely responsible for the observed decrease in coronary artery thrombosis in patients with CHF. patients after myocardial infarction treated with ACE inhibitors.",0,0

Treatment comparisons were: (i) 1 month of oral captopril (starting dose of 6.25 mg increased to 50 mg twice daily) versus matching placebo; ( ii) 1 month of controlled-release oral mononitrate (initial dose of 30 mg increased to 60 mg once daily) versus matching placebo; and (iii) 24 h of intravenous magnesium sulfate (initial bolus of 8 mmol followed by 72 mmol ) versus open control.There were no significant 'interactions' between the effects of these three treatments, and the results for each are based on the randomized comparison of approximately 29,000 active versus 29,000 assigned control patients. Captopril There was a significant proportional reduction of 7% (SD 3) in mortality at 5 weeks (2088 [7.19%] deaths assigned to captopril vs 2231 [7.69%] placebo; 2p = 0.02), which corresponds to an absolute difference of 4.9 SD 2.2 fewer deaths per 1000 patients treated for 1 month. The absolute benefits appeared to be greater (perhaps about 10 fewer deaths per 1,000) in certain higher-risk groups, such as those with a history of previous heart attack or heart failure. The survival advantage appeared to hold longer term (5.4 [SD 2.8] fewer deaths per 1000 at 12 months). Captopril was associated with an increase of 52 (SD 2) patients per 1000 in hypotension considered severe enough to require termination of study treatment, 5 (SD 2) per 1000 in reported cardiogenic shock, and 5 (SD 1 ) per 1000 in some degree of renal dysfunction. It did not produce excess deaths on days 0-1, even among patients with low blood pressure on admission. Mononitrate There was no significant reduction in mortality at 5 weeks, either overall (2,129 [7.34%] deaths assigned to mononitrate vs. 2,190 [7.54%] placebo) or in any subgroup examined (including those assigned to mononitrate). received short-term intravenous or oral treatment outside the study). nitrates at the entrance). Subsequent follow-up did not indicate any subsequent survival advantage. The only significant side effect of the mononitrate regimen studied was a 15 (SD 2 ) per 1000 increase in hypotension. Those assigned to active treatment had slightly fewer deaths on days 0-1, reassuring the safety of using nitrates early in acute MI. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1,1

There were 14 patients in each group, and they were similar (mean +/- SE) in age (54 +/- 3 v 50 +/- 4 years), gender (nine males/five females), and body mass index ( 33, 4 +/- 0.8 vs. 33.9 +/- 0.9 kg/m2). Lisinopril-treated patients had a somewhat greater drop in both systolic (18 +/- 3 v 10 +/- 3 mm Hg) and diastolic (12 +/- 2 v 8 +/- 1 mm Hg) blood pressure, but only the change in systolic pressure was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin and triglycerides were measured at hourly intervals from 8 am to 4 pm (breakfast at 8 am and lunch at 12 noon, p < 0.09). However, plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentration throughout the day did not change with lisinopril treatment. Finally, neither the ability of insulin to mediate glucose disposal nor fasting lipid and lipoprotein concentrations changed with either treatment. In conclusion, blood pressure decreased significantly after treatment with lisinopril (20 mg/day) or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg/day). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED IN 250 WORDS)",0,0

Thirty-nine untreated essential hypertensive patients and 28 normotensive control subjects were studied under baseline conditions. Hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: bisoprolol (10 mg/day, n = 15), enalapril (20 mg/day, n = 12), and verapamil SR (240 mg/day, n = 12), and were studied before and after 1 month of treatment. Plasma catecholamines were determined by radioenzymatic assay. Surface beta 2 -adrenoceptors were measured on intact lymphocytes by a radioligand binding assay using the hydrophilic ligand [ 3 H]-CGP12177. Beta 2 adrenergic receptor density was increased in hypertensive patients (p < 0.01). After treatment, mean arterial pressure decreased similarly in all three groups, while plasma catecholamines did not show significant changes in any group. the number of beta 2-adrenoceptors decreased only in patients treated with bisoprolol (p < 0.05). The decrease in mean arterial pressure correlated with the decrease in beta 2 adrenergic receptors only in patients treated with bisoprolol (r = 0.65, P < 0.05). Beta 2 -adrenoceptor density correlated with plasma epinephrine levels in the control group (r = -0.50, P < 0.01), but not in pretreatment hypertensive patients. This correlation was also observed in hypertensive patients treated with bisoprolol (r = -0.52, p < 0.05), but not in those treated with verapamil or enalapril. Our results suggest that bisoprolol treatment reduces the increase in surface beta 2 -adrenoceptor density and restores its regulation by epinephrine in essential hypertension.

We studied the effect of very early treatment with enalapril in patients with left ventricular failure (Killip classification II-III) as a consequence of AMI. In a double-blind, randomized trial, conventionally treated patients were started on placebo (PL, n = 15) or enalapril 2.5 mg (EN, n = 15) twice daily as early as 24 to 30 hours after AMI. and were followed up for 21 days. One patient died in each treatment group. There were three dropouts in the placebo group (progressive heart failure requiring antiotensin converting enzyme inhibition) and one dropout in the enalapril group (malignant ventricular arrhythmias). Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and norepinephrine decreased similarly in both groups from high baseline concentrations. Patients with the highest baseline ANP levels died in both groups: EN: 579 fmol/mL (mean 65.3 +/- 34.4 fmol/mL), PL: 403 fmol/mL (mean 63.5 +/- - 37.6 fmol/ml). Killip classification improved in 9 of 13 enalapril patients but only 5 of 11 placebo patients. Echocardiography showed an increase in fractional shortening (FS) (3.2 +/- 7.5%, p < 0.05) with enalapril alone. Placebo patients required more diuretics and plasma aldosterone tripled. Therefore, very early treatment with enalapril can help prevent left ventricular failure after AMI. Extremely high initial plasma ANP concentrations may predict an unfavorable outcome.",0,0

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced anemia has recently been reported in chronic hemodialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients. Herein we report on 5 transplant recipients whose hematocrit levels decreased while taking ACE inhibitors, including 2 patients treated with ACE inhibitors for erythrocytosis. Individual mean hematocrit values ranged from 35.0% to 54.7% before treatment and from 27.6% to 42.0% after treatment. The hematocrit level in the 2 patients with erythrocytosis decreased from 54.7% to 39.8% and from 47.5% to 27.6%, respectively. Anemia improved after drug discontinuation or dose reduction. The patients received the same immunosuppressive drugs and had good renal function. No marked ACE inhibitor-induced anemia was observed in the transplant recipient who received a kidney from a twin brother and had not been taking any immunosuppressive medication, nor in the other 8 patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic glomerulonephritis who served as controls. We conclude that ACE inhibitor-induced anemia may frequently arise in an immunosuppressed state.

Drug interactions of clinical importance.,,"Mignat, C; Unger, T","ACE inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure, but there is only limited information on adverse interactions between ACE inhibitors and other cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular drugs. This article offers an overview of this topic, with emphasis on those interactions that have the greatest clinical implications. In patients who are sodium and/or volume depleted by thiazides or loop diuretics, the additional use of ACE inhibitors may lead to excessive reduction in blood pressure and symptomatic hypotension. An increase in serum potassium levels may occur after co-administration of potassium-sparing diuretics and ACE inhibitors, which may lead to hyperkalaemia, especially in patients with renal insufficiency. The incidence of acute renal failure may be associated with ACE inhibitor therapy when these drugs are combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and administered to patients whose renal function becomes increasingly dependent on angiotensin II and prostaglandins. There is some, albeit scant, evidence linking ACE inhibitors to the induction of lithium toxicity in patients receiving lithium therapy and to the occurrence of severe hypersensitivity reactions in patients undergoing hemodialysis, venom immunization, or concomitant treatment. with allopurinol.",0,0

The effects of ACE inhibitor and calcium antagonist treatments were superimposable. Our results from a large database show that antihypertensive treatment effectively reduces all components of PAA.

As a consequence of intense research, a better understanding of the pathophysiology of restenosis has resulted, as well as the design of the clinical studies necessary to study the process. Recent experimental studies suggest that vascular remodeling may be as important as intimal hyperplasia, and future trials should address this aspect of the restenosis process. Current approaches to prevent restenosis include the use of combined drug therapy to target various pathophysiological processes, local drug delivery to the site of injury to maximize drug effect, and the use of highly specific drugs, including local gene therapy. .",0,0

Within 24 h, one of two cardiologists (examiners) with considerable experience in echocardiography visually assessed the wall motion index (WMI). A WMI of < or = 1.2 (corresponding to a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < or = 0.35) meant that the patient was eligible for randomization in the TRACE study. Two other experienced cardiologists with substantial experience in echocardiography (controllers) performed a blinded reassessment of 155 randomly selected videotapes. We show that 93% of the 7001 MIs examined had an evaluable echocardiogram. WMI was < or = 1.2 in 37% of patients. One-year mortality was inversely related to WMI, being 60%, 30%, 14% and 11% in patients with a WMI < 0.8, 0.8-1.2, 1.3-1.6 and > 1.6, respectively. In the random sample of 155 video recordings that were re-evaluated, 97% were technically adequate for analysis by both examiners and controllers. (SHORT SUMMARY IN 250 WORDS)",0,0

Ramipril Study Group.,,"Gundersen, T; Swedberg, K; Amtorp, O; Remes, J; Nilsson, B","Pharmacological therapy in cases of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) is generally evaluated by maximal exercise time. To assess the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, 223 patients with moderate CHF were studied at 24 centers in four Nordic countries in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design. Study drug was titrated from 1.25 mg to a maximum of 10 mg once daily (od) over a 4-week period (mean dose 8 mg). A symptom-limited cycling exercise test, starting at 30 watts and increasing by 10 watts.min-1, was used to assess exercise capacity. Reproducible tests were required at baseline and the test was repeated after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. Seven deaths were recorded in the placebo group and one death in the ramipril group. A total of 195 patients completed 12 weeks of treatment (placebo group n = 91, ramipril group n = 104). The groups had similar baseline characteristics. Maximal exercise time increased by a mean (SD) 35 s (9) and 41 s (8) in the placebo and ramipril groups, respectively. The adjusted difference between groups at 12 weeks was 9 s (12) (ns). A significant decrease in blood pressure and heart rate-pressure product at rest and at the end of exercise was obtained with ramipril compared with placebo. Significantly fewer patients deteriorated in NYHA class from baseline to 12 weeks of treatment with ramipril compared with placebo (P = 0.012). Concomitant CHF medication was significantly increased in the placebo group compared to ramipril-treated patients (p = 0.003). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED IN 250 WORDS)",0,0

Of the 409 patients enrolled in the Captopril study, 108 had nephrotic-range proteinuria (>3.5 g/24 h) at study entry (baseline). This group was the object of the present study. Remission of nephrotic-range proteinuria was defined as follows: (1) Onset of remission was taken as the date when proteinuria was first observed to be < or = 1.0 g/24 h . (2) The reduction in proteinuria had to be maintained for a minimum of six months and until the end of the Captopril Study.

This may help clarify the mechanism of action for pravastatin's rapid beneficial effects on cardiovascular morbidity. We treated 25 hypertensive hypercholesterolemic patients with 12 weeks of pravastatin or placebo in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Plasma lipids were not altered by placebo treatment, while pravastatin treatment for 12 weeks reduced total cholesterol by 27% (from 7.1 +/- 0.27 to 5.2 +/- 0.18, p < 0.001 compared to placebo) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 35%. (from 4.9 +/- 0.36 to 3.2 +/- 0.17, p < 0.001). There were no changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure after 12 weeks of treatment or after 3 weeks of pravastatin withdrawal. Therefore, pravastatin remains effective as a lipid-lowering agent in the presence of antihypertensive therapy, but does not enhance the blood pressure-lowering action of these drugs. Therefore, blood pressure reduction is unlikely to be the mechanism by which pravastatin mediates its short-term effects on cardiovascular morbidity.",0,0

To investigate this issue, we studied the effects of a calcium antagonist, nitrendipine (NIT, 10-20 mg twice daily) and an enzyme-converting inhibitor, lisinopril (LIS, 10-20 mg once daily), on blood pressure (office BP, 24 hr ambulatory), excretion of an acute sodium load (200 mmol/2 hr iv), glomerular filtration rate (insulin clearance), cumulative dopamine excretion, atrial natriuretic peptide ( Plasma ANP) and endothelin excretion in 8 patients with CAH after a heart attack. transplantation in a 6-week, double-blind, randomized crossover trial. Five patients received a diuretic during the trial at a constant dose. Office diastolic BP (DBP) decreased significantly with LIS from 97 +/- 6 to 87 +/- 9 mmHg and with NIT from 96 +/- 7 to 92 +/- 12 mmHg. The 24-hour ambulatory DBP significantly decreased from 96 +/- 7 mmHg to 86 +/- 10 mmHg (LIS) and 84 +/- 11 mmHg (NIT).

Glomerular filtration rate, cumulative excretion of dopamine, ANP, and endothelin excretion did not differ between treatment groups. We conclude that: (1) both drugs were similar in lowering office and daytime BP, but NIT tended to be more effective at night; and (2) cumulative sodium excretion during LIS was significantly increased compared to placebo. There was also a similar trend during NIT. Thus, it is possible that chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and possibly calcium channel blockers may improve the sodium retention status in CAH regardless of differences in blood pressure, ANP, dopamine, or renal function.",0,0

Twelve patients completed both parts of the study.; Blood pressure, plasma converting enzyme activity; plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and norepinephrine; excretion of renal and systemic prostanoid metabolites; The flushing effect of the first and second doses of enalapril in the morning lasted only during the day; in the extended study it lasted 24 hours due to drug accumulation. Converting enzyme inhibitors attenuate bradykinin breakdown and thus enhance bradykinin-mediated prostaglandin E2 synthesis. Evidence was found for such a prostaglandin E2-mediated contribution to ventricular discharge by enalapril, which was blocked by salicylate. The contribution, however, was small and variable, and the addition of salicylate had, on average, no significant offloading effect during the day. The discharge was eliminated in only three of 20 patients in the short-term study and in one of 12 in the long-term study. At night, when other effects of enalapril on blood pressure had subsided and the bradykinin-induced effect persisted, salicylate significantly reduced the small remaining shock effect. No effect of salicylate addition on reversal of remodeling was observed. Enalapril reduced angiotensin II-induced synthesis of systemic and renal prostaglandin I2 and thromboxane A2, initially only during the day, but later also at night. Thus, it masked the suppression of thromboxane A2 synthesis by salicylate, which is the effect attributed to the prevention of salicylate reinfarction; The risk that salicylate substantially reduces the benefit of enalapril in patients with heart failure by unloading the ventricle is low. As with other bradykinin-induced effects, significant discharge occurs in only a minority of patients. However, in the presence of enalapril, salicylate is probably not as effective as expected in reducing the risk of reinfarction, because enalapril already effectively reduces thromboxane A2 synthesis in patients with heart failure and no significant difference was found. further reduction by salicylate.",0,0

Venous compliance was not different between the two groups of borderline hypertensives and was only slightly lower than in controls. The distensibility of large arteries was studied using a non-invasive ultrasound vessel wall motion detection system, while venous compliance was determined by strain gauge plethysmography. Borderline hypertensive patients were subsequently treated with enalapril 10 mg/day, felodipine 5 mg/day, or placebo for six months. Despite similar reductions in blood pressure, enalapril induced a significant increase in muscle compliance in the femoral and brachial arteries, but not in the elastic carotid artery, whereas felodipine had no effect on large artery compliance in patients. the sodium sensitive group. The effect of enalapril on muscular artery compliance was established through a dose-dependent increase in distension and not through a change in arterial diameter. Arterial compliance was not influenced by any of the drugs in the resistant group. Venous compliance was also not altered by medication. In conclusion, femoral and brachial artery compliance in sodium-sensitive borderline hypertensive subjects, which was found to be less than that in sodium-resistant subjects, improved with antihypertensive treatment with enalapril but not with felodipine, despite similar reductions. in blood pressure induced by both drugs.

The Registry comprised a broad spectrum of heart failure patients, including some with predominantly diastolic dysfunction. Drug use was determined across the population at the time of identification (74% hospitalized). The median number of drugs per patient was four, with diuretics in 62%, digitalis in 45%, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in 32%, calcium channel blockers in 36%, antiarrhythmics by 22% and beta-blockers by 18%. Only 18% took the combination of ACE-I, diuretic and digitalis. Stratification for diagnosis, heart failure symptoms, and ejection fractions showed that three-drug therapy (digitalis, diuretic, and ACE-I) was common only in those with ejection fractions less than 0.20 and various signs or symptoms. symptoms of heart failure. Older patients frequently took diuretics (73% of patients older than 70 years), and our European center used fewer drugs overall, while prescribing digitalis half as often as North American clinics. These data serve as a basis for the analysis of the evolution of therapeutic practice in patients with heart failure.",0,0

Prior to study entry, all had a urinary albumin concentration greater than 30 mg/L as determined by documented radioimmunoassay on three separate occasions at 15- to 30-day intervals. Samples were collected before 10 am after an oral water load of 10 mL/kg; Enalapril reduced pre-treatment hyperalbuminuria in 6 patients to normal. One patient whose levels did not reach normal values experienced a 70% reduction. The fractional excretion of sodium, potassium, and lithium did not change during treatment. Mean arterial pressure decreased by 8.6 +/- 0.42 mm Hg. Two years after stopping enalapril, there were no changes in the sodium, potassium, or creatinine levels of 7 patients who had received enalapril, or in their mean arterial pressures. Urinary albumin concentration increased from pretreatment levels in 2 individuals, returned to pretreatment levels in 2, and remained below 30 mg/L in 2; Our results demonstrate that enalapril reduces albuminuria in patients with sickle cell anemia. However, after discontinuation of the drug, albuminuria may increase to pretreatment levels or higher. It remains to be established whether lowering urinary albumin concentration by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can delay the development of progressive renal failure in patients with sickle cell anemia.",0,0

Each patient was then assigned to receive captopril (25 mg twice daily for 1 week) or placebo, in a randomized, double-blind fashion, before repeat clamping. At baseline, plasma ET-1 levels were 0.77 +/- 0.25 pg/mL in captopril (n = 10) and 0.83 +/- 0.3 pg/mL in patients with placebo (n = 5).

Carotid pressure waveforms were recorded noninvasively by applanation tonometry with a Millar micromanometer-tipped probe. The extent of the wave reflection was estimated using the rate of increase defined as the ratio of the pressure wave amplitude above its systolic shoulder to the pulse pressure. Augmentation index, left ventricular mass index by two-dimensional echocardiography, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure were determined before and after 8 weeks of daily treatment with fosinopril (10 to 20 mg) or atenolol (50 to 100 mg) with or without diuretics and compared with those values in 79 normotensive control subjects.

However, it is not clear how the effective reduction in salt intake compares with the addition of other drugs, in particular thiazide diuretics. We directly compared the separate effects on blood pressure of reducing sodium intake or adding a thiazide diuretic to an enzyme-converting enzyme inhibitor in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. We studied 11 subjects with essential hypertension who had been taking captopril 25 mg twice daily for at least 1 month. In the double-blind study, after 1 month of captopril alone, supine blood pressure was 151 +/- 5/95 +/- 4 (SEM) mm Hg. With the addition of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily for 1 month, blood pressure fell to 137 +/- 5/87 +/- 3 mm Hg. When a modest reduction in salt intake (from 206 +/- 26 to 109 +/- 20 mmol urinary sodium/24 h) was added to captopril for 1 month, blood pressure was reduced by a similar amount (to 137 +/- 4 /90 +/- 3 mmHg). Plasma potassium decreased during diuretic treatment (3.9 +/- 0.1 to 3.7 +/- 0.1 mmol/L, P < 0.05) but increased nonsignificantly during salt reduction (3.9 +/- 0.1 to 4.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/L). These results clearly demonstrate that moderate salt reduction, which can be easily achieved, is as effective as a thiazide diuretic in lowering blood pressure in the presence of an enzyme-converting enzyme inhibitor and has the particular advantage that plasma potassium is not decreased. .

Treating physicians may request the consulting/liaison psychiatrist to care for schizophrenics with hyponatremia-induced delirium or other psychiatric syndromes. The referring physician may or may not have identified polydipsia and dilutional hyponatremia and their complications. This article will help the consulting/liaison psychiatrist recognize early evidence of fluid imbalance, describe the evaluation, and provide somatic and behavioral treatment approaches for this life-threatening syndrome.; During the last ten years, the authors have treated more than 100 patients with polydipsia-hyponatremia syndrome. The authors discuss their experience and that of others with medications that help and hinder patients suffering from dilutional hyponatremia. They review the current key articles in the literature on polydipsia-hyponatremia syndrome, including articles identified through the Medline search 1985-94.; Schizophrenics with polydipsia-hyponatremia syndrome most often present with polydipsia, polyuria, urinary incontinence, cognitive, affective, and behavioral changes, seizures, or coma. Quantification of polydipsia, hyponatremia, and diurnal changes in body weight facilitates therapeutic interventions. Treatment includes patient and caregiver education, pharmacologic therapies to better treat psychosis and osmotic dysregulation, behavioral interventions to prevent polydipsia, and daytime weight control; Once recognized, the acute, subacute, and chronic complications of polydipsia-hyponatremia syndrome are easily treatable.

This study determined whether, by sequentially treating each hypertensive patient with six antihypertensive drugs, one from each of the major classes, one could decide which was the best possible drug to control hypertension. In an open-label, randomized, crossover study, 19 patients (16 men and 3 women), 28 to 70 years of age with a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 110 mm Hg, received atenolol, captopril, clonidine, indapamide, prazosin and verapamil sequentially. Each drug was started at the minimum recommended dose or lower, and the dose was increased every 2 weeks, if well tolerated, until blood pressure was controlled (diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg). If blood pressure was controlled, the drug was continued for another 2 weeks. A washout period of at least 2 weeks was allowed between drugs. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced by all six drugs. In 18 of the 19 patients, blood pressure was controlled with at least one of the six drugs, often at the lowest dose. The authors conclude that if hypertension is not controlled with the lowest recommended dose of a drug, other antihypertensive drugs should be tried sequentially rather than increasing the dose or adding a second drug.",0,0

Although such an effect could be beneficial in the treatment of hypertension or congestive heart failure in diabetic patients, it could also precipitate severe hypoglycemia. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a nested case-control study, using data from the Dutch PHARMO system (1986-92), among diabetic patients treated with insulin or oral antidiabetic drugs, who were admitted to hospital with hypoglycemia. We identified 94 patients who had been admitted with hypoglycemia and selected 654 controls from the same cohort. Adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders, hypoglycemia was significantly associated with current ACE inhibitor use (odds ratio 2.8 [95% CI 1.4-5.7]). Among both insulin and oral antidiabetic users, ACE inhibitor use was significantly associated with an increased risk of hospital admission for hypoglycemia (2.8 [1.2-6.4] and 4.1 [1.4-12.2], respectively). Although ACE inhibitors have several advantages over other antihypertensive drugs in diabetes, the risk of hypoglycemia must be taken into account. Further investigation of the mechanism is needed, as up to 13.8% of all hospital admissions for hypoglycemia could be attributed to the use of ACE inhibitors.",0,0

The objectives of this substudy were to evaluate changes in LV structure and function in patients with SOLVD and to test the hypothesis that enalapril inhibits remodeling in patients with LV dysfunction.; Patients who entered the SOLVD prevention and treatment arms from 5 of the 23 clinical centers were recruited for this substudy. All 301 participating patients underwent Doppler echocardiographic evaluation according to standard protocol before randomization to enalapril or placebo and again after 4 and 12 months of treatment.

Analysis of baseline clinical characteristics showed that patients enrolled in the substudy were generally representative of the SOLVD population, although patients in the prevention group were slightly overrepresented in the substudy group (69.8% compared to 61.9% % of remaining SOLVD patients). The enalapril group demonstrated significant reductions in the ratio of the E-wave velocity to the A-wave velocity of the mitral annulus (due predominantly to a reduction in E-wave velocity), and this response was different from that seen in the enalapril group. placebo (P = 0.001). 030).

1431,7751416,Dosage of antihypertensive drugs in patients with renal insufficiency.,,"Carter, B L","The use of antihypertensive agents in patients with renal insufficiency requires careful consideration of dosage, titration, and monitoring. Renal function should be assessed to make appropriate dosage adjustments for antihypertensives that exhibit extensive renal elimination. Thiazide diuretics are useful in mild degrees of renal insufficiency, but loop diuretics become necessary as renal function deteriorates further. With either class, low doses should be used to prevent hypovolemia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia that can worsen renal blood flow. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have become popular because they may have unique kidney-protective properties. All ACE inhibitors except fosinopril require reduced doses and/or less frequent administration in patients with renal insufficiency. It is often necessary to use a diuretic with an ACE inhibitor, and special dosing considerations are important. Due to the demographic and physiological characteristics of patients with renal insufficiency, beta-blockers are often reserved for patients with other indications for beta-blockers, such as ischemic heart disease. Several beta-blockers are eliminated primarily via the kidneys, and the dose of these agents needs to be reduced. Calcium antagonists may also have renal protective effects. Because calcium channel blockers are extensively metabolized, no significant dose adjustments are necessary. Data suggest that antihypertensives may delay the decline in renal failure. The pharmacokinetics of several antihypertensives change with renal failure due to reduced elimination. Therefore, dose adjustments, slower titration, and less frequent administration are often necessary.",0,0
1432,7751417,"Selected aspects of ACE inhibitor therapy for patients with kidney disease: impact on proteinuria, lipids, and potassium.",,"Keilani, T; Schlueter, W; Batlle, D","Overt proteinuria is often accompanied by hypercholesterolemia and is associated with elevated levels of lipoprotein(a). These lipid abnormalities are likely involved in the high incidence of macrovascular complications associated with diabetic nephropathy and possibly other types of nondiabetic proteinuric kidney disease. Over the last decade, many studies have shown that ACE inhibitors can reduce urinary protein excretion, but little attention has been paid to the impact of this form of therapeutic intervention on the lipid profile. In this article, we review our recent data showing that fosinopril administration was associated with significant decreases in both urinary protein excretion, serum total cholesterol levels, and plasma lp(a) levels. The use of ACE inhibitors in patients with impaired renal function may lead to the development of hyperkalaemia as a result of suppression of angiotensin II-driven aldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland. The inhibition of aldosterone secretion may depend on the degree of inhibition of angiotensin II formation in the circulation and also locally in the adrenal gland. Because the various ACE inhibitors exhibit different degrees of ACE inhibition at the tissue level, we have postulated that angiotensin II-dependent aldosterone production will be inhibited to a lesser degree by agents that have low tissue affinity for the adrenal gland. The implication of this theoretical concept for the development of hyperkalaemia in patients with renal insufficiency treated with ACE inhibitors is discussed.",0,0

Fosinopril was administered at a dose of 10 mg once daily for 14 days. The results in the two groups were similar, with no evidence of accumulation of fosinoprilat in patients with hepatic insufficiency. The observed mean (+/- SD) peak plasma concentrations of fosinoprilat in healthy subjects were 112.0 +/- 67.2 ng/mL after the first dose and 144.1 +/- 61.7 ng/mL in the stationary state. Corresponding values for patients with hepatic impairment were 111.4 +/- 40.1 ng/mL and 140.2 +/- 50.9 ng/mL. The area under the serum concentration versus time curve for healthy volunteers was 790.7 +/- 431.0 ng.hr/mL after the first dose and 940.3 +/- 400.4 ng.hr/mL after the first dose. in steady state.

No statistically significant differences in fosinoprilat pharmacokinetic values were detected between healthy and hepatic impaired subjects. The absence of accumulation can be attributed to the double route of elimination of fosinoprilat reported in previous studies. Renal excretion of fosinoprilat in patients with hepatic insufficiency prevents further accumulation. The present findings suggest that the initial dose of fosinopril used in hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function can also be used in patients with liver failure secondary to cirrhosis.",0,0

EGTA group.,,"Aberg, H; MÃ¶rlin, C; Lithell, H","The primary objective of this randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel study was to compare the metabolic effects of 12 months of treatment with an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) with those of a selective beta-blocker (atenolol) in patients with mild hypertension. Patients (35-69 years old) were included if they were without antihypertensive drugs and after six months of non-pharmacological treatment presented DBP in supine position between 90 and 104 mmHg; 220 patients were randomized to enalapril (20 or 40 mg/day) and 218 to atenolol (50 or 100 mg/day). After 12 months of treatment, atenolol significantly increased glucose concentrations at 60, 90, and 120 minutes after oral intake of 75 g of glucose (p < 0.01), whereas enalapril did not. Atenolol significantly increased fasting blood glucose and insulin concentration 120 minutes after glucose ingestion, while enalapril did not. Plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly increased in patients receiving atenolol but not in those receiving enalapril. HDL cholesterol was significantly decreased in the atenolol group but not in the enalapril group. The proportions of patients with clinical adverse experiences were similar in both treatment groups. These results indicate that enalapril does not influence glucose tolerance or lipoprotein metabolism, while atenolol does. These findings are consistent over the 12-month treatment period and confirm the results of previous short-term studies.",0,0

In patients treated with enalapril, plasma creatinine and albuminuria values remained stable throughout the observation period. His total plasma cholesterol decreased from a baseline value of 245 +/- 27 mg/dl to a mean study value of 236 +/- 29 mg/dl, and to a fifth year value of 232 +/- 27 mg/dl (P < 0.001). Changes in HDL cholesterol and triglyceride values were not significant. In the placebo group, there was a significant increase in albuminuria and a mean 13% decrease in reciprocal creatinine values over five years. Plasma total cholesterol increased from a mean baseline value of 246 +/- 24 to a mean study value of 252 +/- 25 mg/dl, and to a mean value at year five of 259 +/- 32 mg/dl ( P < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between baseline and mean plasma total cholesterol values and decreased renal function and increased albuminuria in placebo-treated patients. This correlation persisted after blood pressure stratification. Enalapril treatment did not eliminate these correlations. Cholesterol may be an additional risk factor for diabetic nephropathy. ACE inhibitors may have a modest cholesterol-lowering effect in diabetic patients, mediated in part by reducing albuminuria.",0,0

Addition of felodipine or ramipril to long-term beta-blocker therapy.,,"Siewert-Delle, A; Ljungman, S; Hartford, M; Wikstrand, J","The effect of intensified blood pressure (BP) control with a reduction in diastolic BP to < or = 85 mm Hg on renal function and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was studied in 28 men with primary hypertension (aged 62 to 72 years of age) treated for 13 +/- 5 years with beta-blockers, diuretics, or hydralazine. They were compared with 25 age-matched normotensive (NT) men. At baseline (BL), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF) (inulin and para-aminohippurate clearance), and UAEs were studied. Thereafter, all antihypertensive drugs except beta-blockers were withdrawn, and felodipine (5 to 20 mg; n = 13) or ramipril (2.5 to 10 mg; n = 15) were added in a randomized, double-blind fashion. . Hydrochlorothiazide was added if necessary. The investigations were repeated after 6 weeks and 1 year of double-blind treatment. In BL, BP and renal vascular resistance (RVR) were significantly higher and GFR and RPF were significantly lower in both hypertensive groups than in NT. After 1 year, all patients in the felodipine group reached the BP treatment goal, but only two-thirds of those in the ramipril group, despite the addition of diuretics to 60% of the latter group. In the felodipine group, BP, GFR, and RVR after 1 year were no longer significantly different from normal. EAU and fractional albumin clearance increased significantly after 1 year of treatment in the felodipine group but did not change in the ramipril group. However, fractional albumin clearance did not differ significantly from normal in either BL or after 1 year of treatment in either hypertensive group. Therefore, it is possible to lower BP and improve renal function in primary hypertension to levels not significantly different from normal after treatment with felodipine in combination with beta-blockers. Although this regimen slightly increased low UAE, albumin fractional clearance changed less and did not differ significantly from normal. The ramipril/beta-blocker combination reduced BP less and did not change slightly reduced renal function and UAE.",0,0

However, it is unknown whether the DD genotype is associated with adverse cardiac remodeling. To address this question, we genotyped patients enrolled in the Captopril and Thrombolysis Study (CATS), a prospective trial in which patients received captopril or placebo during and after thrombolysis for a first prior myocardial infarction; Cardiac volume was determined by echocardiography immediately after thrombolysis and at 1-year follow-up. The angiotensin converting enzyme genotype was determined in 96 patients. Norepinephrine levels were assessed during and immediately after thrombolysis; Immediately after thrombolysis, cardiac output did not differ between genotype groups. However, at 1-year follow-up, both end-systolic and end-diastolic left ventricular volumes were significantly greater in the DD genotype group. Norepinephrine increased to higher levels in the DD genotype group receiving placebo therapy. Captopril treatment effectively mitigated both norepinephrine elevation and cardiac dilation in the DD genotype group; This exploratory study suggests that homozygosity for the angiotensin-converting enzyme deletion-type allele is associated with increased neurohumoral activation as well as increased cardiac dilation after prior acute myocardial infarction, an effect that may be susceptible. to inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme.",0,0
1443,7759839,Hypertension and vasculature: arterioles and the myogenic response.,,"Izzard, A S; Heagerty, A M","This editorial was invited by the Journal of Hypertension as part of a series designed to examine our current understanding of various aspects of the pathophysiology of hypertension. This article considers the small arteries and arterioles.; The conclusion that established hypertension is characterized by normal cardiac output and elevated peripheral resistance represents the integration of the results of hemodynamic studies using a variety of disease models examined by several different techniques. In a way, it assumes that all vascular beds conform to the same response pattern. However, given the apparent heterogeneity of functions performed by specialized tissues, the recognized variations in receptor populations, and the differences in innervation found in the vascular wall throughout the circulation, this might not be the case. Resistance to blood flow occurs throughout the vascular tree, but most is found at the level of the arterioles. Upstream small arteries show growth and remodeling changes that result in luminal narrowing, but the exact contribution of these vessels to resistance remains unknown. Perhaps the most interesting recent finding in this context is that arterial pressure can fall immediately after a pressor stimulus has been removed, despite the demonstration of such structural changes in small arteries. In addition, some whole animal studies have been reported that do not show the expected vascular amplification when the circulation is fully overloaded.; Viewing the vascular tree as an integrated circuit with specialized functions when it nourishes specific tissues suggests that when resistance in a vascular bed rises due to a constricting challenge, this might not be representative of the circulation as a whole: in fact, resistance may fall. somewhere else. Structural changes in the small arteries likely represent the consequence of hypertension. The pathogenesis of hypertension may lie downstream in the arterioles, where a myogenic response could play a key role.",0,0

Elevated neurohormonal levels are associated with increased mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. Multiple studies have shown that ACE inhibitors decrease mortality and morbidity in these patients. In the Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) Studies, enalapril significantly reduced mortality in patients with symptomatic LV dysfunction (treatment trial). In contrast, in patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction (prevention trial), there was no significant reduction in mortality with enalapril treatment. The effect of enalapril was examined in 333 patients in the prevention trial and 129 patients in the treatment trial. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) activity and plasma renin were measured in these patients at baseline and at 4 and 12 months of follow-up. In a subset of these patients, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and arginine vasopressin were also measured. Analysis of covariance models were used to determine the effect of enalapril on each neurohormone. Participants in the treatment trial had significantly higher neurohormonal levels compared to those in the prevention trial or normal control subjects.

1451,7774515,Ramipril. An updated review of its therapeutic use in essential hypertension and heart failure.,,"Frampton, J E; Peters, D H","Ramipril is a second generation angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Like enalapril, it is a prodrug and is hydrolyzed in vivo to release the active metabolite, ramiprilat, which has a long elimination half-life, allowing once-daily administration. The antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril has been confirmed in large-scale non-comparative studies conducted in general practice, as well as in more rigorously controlled clinical trials. In the former, approximately 85% of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension have responded successfully to treatment with ramipril 2.5 or 5 mg/day, while comparative trials indicate that the antihypertensive efficacy of the drug is equivalent. that of other established ACE inhibitors and atenolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. As expected, the response rate to ramipril monotherapy is lower in patients with severe hypertension (about 40%), although the hypotensive effect may be potentiated by the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide or piretanide. The antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril is maintained in patients with diabetes mellitus, and preliminary data indicate that the drug has the beneficial effect of decreasing urinary albumin excretion in diabetic patients with renal disease. Ramipril is superior to atenolol in causing regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, although the clinical significance of this effect per se remains to be established. The large Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) study showed that ramipril 5 or 10 mg/day significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 27% in patients with clinical evidence of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction , even if it is transitory. The beneficial effect of ramipril was evident after 30 days of treatment and appeared to be greater in patients with more severe ventricular damage after a heart attack. Ramipril is well tolerated in general practice, with 5% or less of patients discontinuing treatment due to drug intolerance. Available data suggest that ramipril shares a similar tolerability profile to other established ACE inhibitors. Therefore, clinical data confirm that ramipril is a useful alternative to ACE inhibitors for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension and indicate a beneficial effect of the drug in patients with clinical evidence of heart failure after a stroke. acute myocardial infarction. It is also reasonable to assume that ramipril will be of value in treating patients with more established heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.",0,0

Then and now.,,"Simmons, J; Willens, H J; Kessler, K M","In the last decade there have been drastic changes in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While previous management strategies were primarily supportive, current strategies focus on achieving and maintaining infarct-related artery patency, restoring blood flow to compromised myocytes, preserving left ventricular function, and preventing recurrences. and complications, in addition to promoting healing. Restoration of blood flow can be achieved pharmacologically with thrombolytic agents or mechanically with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Early use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents helps maintain the patency of infarct-related arteries and prevents thromboembolic complications. Administration of beta blockers and angiotensin enzyme inhibitors are more specific means of sparing the myocardium and preserving ventricular function. In addition, several strategies to prevent arrhythmias, such as the prophylactic use of lidocaine and systematic long-term suppression of premature ventricular contractions with antiarrhythmic drugs, are no longer recommended. Basically, in the era before the eighth decade of this century, the therapeutic strategy for AMI had as its main direction the reduction of oxygen demands in the infarcted myocardium; while in subsequent years, the emphasis shifts to improving oxygen delivery, through thrombolysis, PTCA, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. These interventional changes, added to a greater sophistication in the use of drugs to reduce oxygen demands, resulted in a significant reduction in myocardial mortality.",0,0

In a second study, the same measurements were made after administering 50 mg of oral indomethacin or placebo 30 minutes before ""open"" captopril (study B); Blood pressure was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer. Cardiac output was determined by Doppler interrogation of blood flow in the ascending aorta and echocardiographic measurement of aortic root diameter. Renal blood flow was calculated from effective renal plasma flow measured by p-aminohippurate clearance and hematocrit, and glomerular filtration rate by endogenous creatinine clearance. Limb blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography using mercury in silastic strain gauges. Plasma prostaglandin E2 concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay; University Department of Cardiovascular Medicine.; 12 patients with stable chronic heart failure before starting treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; Indomethacin produced adverse effects on cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, urinary sodium excretion, and calf vascular resistance. The changes were reversed by prostaglandin E2 infusion. Indomethacin pretreatment resulted in attenuation of the acute increase in cardiac output and decrease in systemic vascular resistance that occurred with captopril. Similarly, an increase in renal blood flow with captopril was attenuated by indomethacin; The acute adverse effects of indomethacin on central and peripheral hemodynamic and renal function suggest that prostaglandins have an important role in the regulation of peripheral blood flow and renal function in patients with stable chronic heart failure. Indomethacin's attenuation of captopril-induced improvements in hemodynamic function and renal blood flow is consistent with the hypothesis that captopril may act in part through an increase in prostaglandin synthesis.",0,0

Collaborative Study Group.,,"Rodby, R A; Rohde, R; Evans, J; Bain, R P; Mulcahy, W S; Lewis, E J","prospective randomized clinical trial has been initiated to continue follow-up in a subset of patients previously enrolled in the recently completed Type 1 Diabetic Nephropathy Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACEi) Inhibition Study. In that study, the use of captopril was associated with a 48% reduction in the risk of doubling serum creatinine and a 50% reduction in the risk of undergoing dialysis, transplantation, or death, compared to the use of placebo. These effects were independent of the effect of captopril on blood pressure. This study is designed to determine whether mean arterial pressure (MAP) level, using the ACE inhibitor ramipril as primary therapy, is associated with a better prognosis of diabetic nephropathy with respect to (1) the rate of decline in renal function ; (2) the rate of progression to end-stage renal failure; (3) the clinical course of proteinuria; (4) morbidity; and (5) mortality. Patients are randomized into one of two different blood pressure control groups, an Intensive Group #1, MAP < or = 92 mm Hg; and a Moderate Group #2, MAP 100 to 107 mm Hg. Patients previously enrolled in the ""ACEi in Type 1 Diabetic Nephropathy Study"" whose serum creatinine was less than 4.0 mg/dL (354 mumol/L) were eligible for randomization in this study.

For this purpose, 30 patients (22 women and 8 men) with mild to moderate essential hypertension, aged 47 years +/- 2 years, were treated with enalapril maleate (MK 421, an ACE inhibitor) for six weeks. They underwent M-mode and Doppler echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography at baseline and after six weeks of treatment with enalapril. In this study, all patients treated with the ACE inhibitor enalapril responded with a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (p < 0.001). A significant reduction in left ventricular mass index was shown after six weeks of treatment with enalapril (p < 0.01). Total peripheral resistance and end-systolic stress decreased in the same time course (p < 0.001). Ejection fraction increased in both examinations after six weeks of enalapril treatment, but this increase was not statistically significant. In radionuclide examinations, the time to maximum filling rate was significantly decreased after six weeks of enalapril treatment (p < 0.02). Despite these improvements in systolic and diastolic cardiac parameters, cardiac output and stroke volume decreased slightly after enalapril treatment.

1474,7811401,Unpredictable mechanisms of adverse drug reactions.,,"Rieder, M J","Adverse drug reactions are common problems associated with therapy and are major sources of morbidity and mortality. There are numerous types of drug reactions, including predictable drug reactions such as side effects, toxicity, drug interactions, and side effects that can be anticipated when planning therapy. There are also a number of unforeseen adverse effects, which are unexpected consequences of the therapy. The least serious unforeseen adverse drug reaction is intolerance, which appears to be an exaggeration of the pharmacological or toxic effects of the drug among vulnerable subgroups of patients. Some of the most serious and life-threatening adverse drug reactions are allergic. These adverse effects may be mediated by a number of mechanisms, including the development of drug-specific IgE, serum sickness-like reactions in response to drug-antibody complexes, direct release of inflammatory mediators, or involvement of the immune system by mechanisms that are misunderstood. Idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions are a heterogeneous group of adverse effects that are not predictable from the pharmacological actions of the drug. Many of these reactions occur as a consequence of pharmacogenetic variations in drug bioactivation and detoxification or elimination of the drug or metabolite. The physician should be aware of the possibility of unpredictable adverse drug reactions during or after treatment. Research currently underway may provide an opportunity to predict and hopefully prevent some of these adverse reactions in the future.",0,0

Angiotensin converting enzyme activity was suppressed and plasma concentrations of aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide were reduced after 12 weeks of treatment with ramipril compared to placebo. In patients with the most pronounced neurohormonal activation at baseline (highest one-third of norepinephrine concentration or prediction score), norepinephrine concentration and prediction score were significantly lower after 12 weeks of taking ramipril compared with the placebo. Patients with a prediction score in the highest third at baseline had a higher heart rate than those in the lowest third (P = 0.003); Neurohormonal activation is associated with the degree of symptoms and the severity of the disease in mild or moderately severe congestive heart failure. Ramipril treatment attenuates neurohormonal activation. This effect is more pronounced among patients with the highest circulating concentrations of neurohormones before the start of treatment.",0,0

Data on the prevalence of post-transplant hypertension and the relationship between immunosuppressive drugs and the persistence of hypertension in a large population of North American children are not available. This study was designed by the North American Pediatric Renal Transplantation Cooperative Study to assess in a large and diverse multicenter population of children the prevalence of post-transplant hypertension, the type of antihypertensive medications used to treat this hypertension, and to determine the relationship between control of blood pressure and immunosuppressive therapy. Analysis of 277 patients showed the following: (1) 70% of recipients required antihypertensive medications 1 month after transplant compared with 48% before transplant; the incidence decreased to 59% at 24 months; (2) most children received multiple drug therapy to control blood pressure; (3) hypertension can be effectively controlled despite inherent etiologic factors, such as allograft source, prior hypertension, and immunosuppressive therapy.",0,0

Therefore, it is of interest to compare the effects of pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to the treatment of hypertension in reducing LVM.; Changes in LV structure were assessed using M-mode echocardiograms in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 844 participants with mild hypertension randomized to either a nutritional and hygiene (NH) intervention plus placebo or NH plus one of five classes. of antihypertensive agents: (1) diuretic (chlorthalidone), (2) beta blocker (acebutolol), (3) alpha antagonist (doxazosin mesylate), (4) calcium antagonist (amlodipine maleate), or (5) calcium antagonist angiotensin converting enzyme (enalapril maleate). ). Echocardiograms were performed at baseline, 3 months, and annually for 4 years. Blood pressure changes averaged 16/12 mm Hg in the active treatment groups and 9/9 mm Hg in the NH-only group. All groups showed significant decreases (10% to 15%) in LVM from baseline that appeared at 3 months and continued for 48 months. The chlorthalidone group experienced the greatest decrease at each follow-up visit (mean decrease, 34 g), although differences from other groups were modest (mean decrease among 5 other groups, 24 to 27 g). Participants randomized to the NH intervention alone had mean changes in LVM similar to those of participants randomized to the NH intervention plus pharmacological treatment. The greatest difference between groups was observed at 12 months, with mean decreases ranging from 35 g (chlorthalidone group) to 17 g (acebutolol group) (p = 0.001 when comparing all groups). Intragroup analysis showed that changes in weight, urinary sodium excretion, and systolic BP moderately correlated with changes in LVM, being statistically significant in most analyses.; The NH intervention with an emphasis on weight loss and dietary sodium reduction is as effective as the NH intervention plus pharmacological treatment in reducing echocardiographically determined LVM, despite a lesser decrease in blood pressure in the NH only intervention group. One possible exception is that the addition of a diuretic (chlorthalidone) may have a modest additional effect in reducing LVM.",0,0

1483,7834934,Neuroendocrine activation in relation to left ventricular function in chronic severe congestive heart failure: a subgroup analysis of the North Scandinavia Cooperative Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS).,,"Eriksson, S V; Eneroth, P; Kjekshus, J; Offstad, J; Swedberg, K","Left ventricular (LV) function and plasma levels of cardiovascular hormones were examined in patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) randomized to receive either placebo or enalapril in addition to conventional therapy. M-mode echocardiography and plasma hormone concentrations were available at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment. There was a significant relationship between LV systolic function and angiotensin-II and norepinephrine levels. Enalapril increased LV fractional shortening (FS%) (13.3 +/- 5.6 to 15.4 +/- 5.8, p < 0.05) and decreased systolic time interval index (0. 58 +/- 0.14 to 0.48 +/- 0.15, p < 0.05) concurrent with a significant decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and in aldosterone, angiotensin-II, and norepinephrine concentrations after 6 weeks. No changes were found in the placebo group. However, there was no direct relationship between the amount of change in neurohormones and the improvement in LV function after 6 weeks. These findings indicate that in patients with severe chronic CHF, severe LV systolic dysfunction is associated with elevated plasma levels of angiotensin-II and norepinephrine, which can be favorably modified by enalapril. This may be important in prolonging life in severe heart failure. The lack of relationship between changes in individual hormones and systolic function suggests a complex dynamic interaction. Therefore, it is not sufficient to predict changes in LV function by measuring changes in a single hormone.",0,0

Therefore, hemodynamic effects and side effects during antihypertensive treatment were examined in 146 patients receiving lisinopril (20 mg once daily) and 147 patients receiving slow-release nifedipine (20 mg twice daily) who they started the six-week treatment period. One patient in the lisinopril group and two patients in the nifedipine group were excluded from the efficacy analysis because their supine DBP after the run-in period was < 95 mmHg. Adverse reactions, mostly transient during the initial treatment period, and withdrawals occurred in six (4.1%) and three (2.1%) patients in the lisinopril group and in 12 (8.2%; NS) and three (2.0%) patients from the nifedipine group, respectively. After the six-week treatment period, the lisinopril group showed 19 non-responders (supine DBP > or = 95 mmHg) out of the remaining 142 patients and the nifedipine group showed 20 non-responders out of the remaining 142 patients. Initial supine and standing heart rates were similar in both groups. Supine heart rate was significantly reduced in the lisinopril group, while standing heart rate in this group and supine and standing heart rates in the nifedipine group did not change significantly with treatment.

The case presented here is the second report in which the patient's blood pressure was not adequately controlled with fluids and traditional vasopressors and required angiotensin II infusion; Although only a few cases of ACE inhibitor overdose have been reported, it is possible that with the widespread use of these agents, overdose may become a more common problem. Management of ACE inhibitor overdose should include general supportive care, bowel decontamination when possible, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors if necessary.

Qualifying patients (n = 51) were assigned to placebo, losartan 25 or 100 mg, or enalapril 20 mg. Blood pressure, plasma drug concentrations, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system mediators were measured on 4 days of hospitalization: at the end of the placebo run-in period, after the first dose, and 2 and 6 weeks of treatment. Plasma drug concentrations were similar after the first and last doses of losartan. At 6 weeks, losartan 100 mg and enalapril 20 mg showed comparable antihypertensive activity. Four hours after dosing, compared to the run-in day, losartan 100 mg increased plasma renin activity 1.7-fold and Ang II 2.5-fold, whereas enalapril increased plasma renin activity 2 .8 times and decreased Ang II by 77%. Both drugs decreased plasma aldosterone concentration. For losartan, plasma renin activity and Ang II increases were greater at 2 than at 6 weeks. The effects of losartan were dose related. After the last dose of losartan, plasma renin activity and Ang II changes were similar to changes from placebo at 36 hours. These results indicate that long-term Ang II feedback receptor blockade in hypertensive patients produces modest increases in plasma renin activity and Ang II that do not appear to affect the antihypertensive response to the antagonist.",0,0

Amlodipine (10 mg) was more effective than the same dose of lisinopril in controlling hypertension (24-hour mean blood pressure, 111 +/- 9 and 115 +/- 9 mm Hg, respectively; P < 0.05) . Blood pressure during both treatments was lower than during placebo (124 +/- 12 mm Hg, P < 0.05). Compared with placebo, amlodipine treatment was associated with a significant increase in glomerular filtration rate (10 +/- 20%, P < 0.05) and renal effective plasma flow (27 +/- 20%, P < 0.01) and a decrease in renal vascular resistance (23 +/- 18%, P < 0.01). Renal hemodynamics did not change during lisinopril. None of the drugs had an effect on proteinuria. The data indicate that amlodipine is more effective than lisinopril in controlling hypertension in patients treated with cyclosporine and that treatment with amlodipine but not lisinopril is associated with an increase in glomerular filtration rate and renal effective plasma flow and a decreased renal vascular resistance. The data suggest that the renin-angiotensin system does not play a major role in determining cyclosporine-associated changes in renal hemodynamics and has a limited role in determining cyclosporine-associated hypertension.",0,0

Thirty-five patients who remained off treatment (Study 1) and 44 N-of-1 trial participants (Study 2) were consecutively selected if their clinical blood pressure was between 160/95 and 220/115 mm Hg and there were no hypertensive complications. . Blood pressure was measured daily at home for 21 days (three consecutive measurements, morning and afternoon). Each N-of-1 trial was a single-blind treatment consisting of two successive pairs of 10-day treatments, each pair comprising 5 days of placebo followed by 5 days of enalapril 20 mg once daily in the morning. Study 1 showed no significant regression of blood pressure toward the mean over 20 days and justified the choice of 5-day treatment periods in Study 2.

As a consequence of this methodological limitation, there are no data on the effects of long-term antihypertensive therapy on global arterial impedance properties and indices of myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). Using recently validated noninvasive techniques, we compared the effects of chronic oral treatment with ramipril, nifedipine, and atenolol on arterial impedance and mechanical power dissipation, as well as MVO2 indices, in hypertensive patients.; Sixteen African-American subjects with systemic hypertension were studied in a randomized, double-blind, crossover protocol. Instantaneous central aortic pressure and flow, from which arterial load characteristics can be derived, were estimated from calibrated subclavian pulse tracings (SPT) and aortic continuous-wave Doppler velocity in conjunction with two-dimensional echocardiographic measurements. (2D) of the aortic annulus, respectively. . To derive ventricular wall stress and MVO2 indices, short-axis (M-mode) and long-axis (2D echo) images of the left ventricle were acquired simultaneously with SPT. Data were collected at the end of a 2-week washout period (pre-drug control) and after 6 weeks of treatment with each agent. Although all three agents reduced diastolic blood pressure to the same extent, different effects on mean and systolic pressures and vascular impedance properties were observed. Nifedipine reduced total peripheral resistance (TPR; 1744 +/- 398 vs. 1290 +/- 215 dyne-s/cm5) and increased arterial compliance (ACL; 1.234 +/- 0.253 vs. 1.776 +/- 0.415 mL/ mmHg). This improvement in arterial compliance is not fully explained by the reduction in distending pressure. Ramipril also decreased TPR (1740 +/- 292 vs. 1437 +/- 290 dyne-s/cm5) and increased ACL (1.214 +/- 0.190 vs. 1.569 +/- 0.424 ml/mm Hg), but with this agent, the change in arterial compliance was explained solely on the basis of a reduction in distending pressure. Atenolol, in contrast, did not affect either TPR or ACL. Consistent with compliance results, nifedipine and ramipril significantly reduced the first two harmonics of the impedance spectrum, but atenolol did not. Neither of these agents resulted in a significant change in the characteristic impedance or relative amplitude of the reflected pressure wave. Total vascular mechanical power and percentage oscillatory power remained unchanged with all antihypertensive treatments. Only ramipril and nifedipine reduced the integral of both meridional and circumferential systolic wall stresses, indicating that MVO2 per beat was reduced by these agents. Stress time index, a measure of MVO2 per unit of time, was significantly decreased with ramipril but not with nifedipine due to an increase in heart rate seen in 10 of 16 patients (mean increase, 10 beats per minute). Therefore, a reduction in MVO2 along with unchanged total vascular mechanical power suggests a higher efficiency of ventriculoarterial coupling with ramipril and with nifedipine in the subgroup of patients in whom heart rate remained unchanged. In contrast, there was no evidence of a reduction in wall stress, stress integral, or stress-time index with atenolol; The non-invasive methodology used in this study constitutes a new tool for serial and simultaneous evaluation of arterial hemodynamics and left ventricular energetics in systemic hypertension. In this study, we demonstrate the differential effects of chronic antihypertensive therapies on systemic arterial circulation and MVO2 indices in African-American subjects. Consideration of the differential drug-induced responses of arterial load and MVO2 indices with each drug may provide a more physiological approach to the treatment of systemic hypertension in individuals.",0,0

It compares control tight blood pressure control (target: < 150/85 mmHg) versus less tight control (target: < 180/105 mmHg) and, within the tight control group, an ACE inhibitor, captopril, versus a beta-blocker, atenolol. We present the efficacy, treatment side effects, biochemical responses, and incidence of hypoglycemia in 755 patients (mean age 57 years, blood pressure 150/94 mmHg) followed up for 2 years. At 2 years, blood pressure was 143/84 in the tight control group and 156/90 mmHg in the less tight control group (p < 0.0001). Blood pressure reduction, treatment adherence, incidence of side effects and hypoglycemia were similar with captopril and atenolol. Atenolol-treated patients had a greater body weight gain (+2.3 vs. +0.7 kg, p < 0.01) and a nonsignificant trend toward greater triglyceride gain than captopril-treated patients. A large difference in blood pressure was obtained between the strict control and less strict control groups, with captopril and atenolol having similar hypotensive effects.

Animal data suggest that treatment of hypertension can restore normal NO-mediated responses. We have prospectively examined the effect of standard antihypertensive therapy on responsiveness to local intra-arterial infusions of L-NMMA in 18 newly diagnosed hypertensive patients; This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study. Patients were randomized to treatment with enalapril 10 mg daily, amlodipine 5 mg daily, or placebo for 6 weeks (with dose adjustment after 2 weeks if necessary); Forearm blood flow during direct brachial artery infusion of L-NMMA (1, 2, and 4 µmol/min) was measured using venous occlusion plethysmography at the beginning and end of the 6-week treatment period; Both enalapril and amlodipine significantly lowered blood pressure compared to placebo. After 6 weeks of antihypertensive therapy, forearm blood flow (+/- SEM) in response to the maximum dose of L-NMMA (4 µmol/min) was reduced by 54.8 (6.9)% (P = 0.012), 58.9 (7.0)% (P = 0.016), and 33.1 (3.0)% (P = 0.17) in the enalapril, amlodipine, and placebo groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between the enalapril and amlodipine treatment groups; Forearm arterial responsiveness to L-NMMA in newly diagnosed patients with essential hypertension returns to normal with normalization of blood pressure by antihypertensive drugs with different modes of action. It remains to be determined whether this phenomenon is a consequence of the change in pressure per se or the result of the action of either drug by a common or separate mechanism.",0,0

BP was also measured intra-arterially (brachial artery) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was recorded. Intraerythrocytic sodium and potassium were measured by flame photometry at baseline and after 26 weeks of active treatment in hypertensive patients and also in 28 age- and sex-matched normotensive control subjects. There was a significant positive relationship between intra-arterial BP and intra-erythrocyte sodium in untreated hypertensives, but no significant difference in mean intra-erythrocyte sodium or potassium content between hypertensive and normotensive subjects at baseline. The distribution of intraerythrocyte sodium values, however, differed between hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Supine MAP was reduced from 113 +/- 4 to 97 +/- 3 mmHg and from 110 +/- 3 to 102 +/- 2 mmHg with enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide treatment, respectively. BP lowering with enalapril was associated with a significant decrease in intraerythrocyte sodium (P = 0.02), whereas hydrochlorothiazide had no effect. There was no significant correlation between delta MAP and delta intraerythrocyte sodium after 26 weeks in either group. Intraerythrocyte potassium did not change with treatment with either drug. In conclusion, there was a significant relationship between intra-arterial BP and intraerythrocyte sodium in untreated hypertensive patients. Both enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide reduced BP effectively, whereas enalapril only reduced intraerythrocyte sodium. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED IN 250 WORDS)",0,0

Study of Captopril and Thrombolysis.,,"Dambrink, J H; Tuininga, Y S; van Gilst, W H; Peels, K H; Lie, K I; Kingma, J H","Reduced heart rate variability has been identified as an important prognostic factor after myocardial infarction. This factor is thought to reflect an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, which can lead to unfavorable loading conditions and thus promote left ventricular dilation; 298 patients in a multicenter clinical trial were randomized to captopril or placebo after a first prior myocardial infarction. All patients were treated with streptokinase prior to randomization. In the present substudy, complete data, including heart rate variability and echocardiographic measurements, were available for 80 patients. The patients were divided into two groups: those with a reduced heart rate variability index (< or = 25) and those with a normal heart rate variability index (> 25). Heart rate variability was assessed by Holter monitoring 24 h before discharge. Left ventricular volumes were assessed by echocardiography before discharge and 3 and 12 months after myocardial infarction. The extent of myocardial injury, severity of coronary artery disease, functional class, hemodynamic variables, and medication were also considered possible determinants of left ventricular dilatation; Before discharge, end-systolic and diastolic volumes were not different in the two groups. After 12 months in patients with reduced heart rate variability, end-systolic volume (mean (SD)) had increased by 6 (14) mL/m2 (P = 0.043), and end-diastolic volume had increased by 8 ( 17) ml/m2 (P = 0.024). Left ventricular volumes did not change in patients with normal heart rate variability. In addition, patients with left ventricular dilatation had larger enzymatic infarct size and higher heart rates and rate-pressure products. A reduced heart rate variability index before discharge was an independent risk factor for left ventricular dilatation during follow-up. Measurement of heart rate variability after three months had no predictive value for this event.; Evaluation of the heart rate variability index before discharge, but not at three months, provided important additional information to identify patients at risk of left ventricular dilatation.",0,0

Participating physicians followed their usual office procedures to initiate quinapril treatment (10 mg once daily in most cases). Dose was adjusted for blood pressure response, generally at 2-week intervals, for a maintenance dose of 10 mg once daily to 20 mg once daily in the majority of cases (86% at 6 months) and not to exceed 40 mg once daily. The use of concomitant antihypertensive medications was left to the discretion of the physician. By random assignment, clinicians obtained informed consent from the patient on a detailed form that listed possible side effects of quinapril or on a less specific form that did not list particular side effects. The purpose of using two different forms was to assess any potential association between the frequency of adverse event reporting and patient knowledge of quinapril side effects. Patients also received an educational packet that provided general information about hypertension and lifestyle modifications known to reduce cardiovascular risk factors. An intention-to-treat analysis included data from 3742 patients in whom the median age was 56 years and the median duration of hypertension was 5 years. The demographic characteristics of these patients were similar to those identified in Canadian hypertensive patients in a recent population-based survey. Nearly 80% of patients in the ACCEPT study had more than one cardiovascular risk factor in addition to hypertension. Among 2,979 patients who received quinapril at 3 months, 77% stabilized. Among 2,517 patients who continued to receive quinapril at 6 months, 84% stabilized. Greater decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed among patients who continued to receive quinapril as part of an antihypertensive regimen than among those who discontinued quinapril treatment. Blood pressure responses to quinapril were similar in newly diagnosed patients and those with a history of hypertension. A total of 980 patients (26.2%) reported one or more adverse events. Cough was reported more frequently and was considered definitely related to quinapril treatment by the treating physician in 3.6% of cases. Serious adverse events occurred in 55 patients (1.5%) and were assessed as possibly related to quinapril in only three patients. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0,0

The dose was doubled and, if necessary, hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg/day was added in the last month. The results in 95 patients showed that the mean reduction in SBP/DBP in the supine position at one month, 2 and 3 months of treatment was 10.3/8.0, 13.2/8.7 and 19.1/13. .7mmHg, respectively. At the end of the study, 80 percent of patients showed normalization of supine diastolic blood pressure (supine DBP < or = 90 mmHg) and 30 percent received combination therapy of perindopril and hydrochlorothiazide. There were no significant changes in routine hematology or serum biochemistry except for a slight increase in potassium levels in patients receiving perindopril 8 mg monotherapy. The incidence of side effects and abandonment of treatment was quite low. Cough was the main reported side effect comprising 13.6 percent with only 1 case withdrawn.

In the case of acute myocardial infarction, coronary care units as currently used are quite expensive, but could be made much more efficient with more effective triage and resource utilization; reperfusion by thrombolysis is cost-effective, as are beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after myocardial infarction in appropriate patients. The cost-effectiveness of CAD screening tests depends largely on the prevalence of the disease in the population studied. The profitability of CABG surgery depends on the orientation; for example, it is very effective for conditions such as left main trunk and three-vessel disease, but not for minor diseases. PTCA appears to be cost-effective in situations where there is clinical consensus for its use, eg severe ischemia and single vessel disease, but requires further analysis based on randomized data; coronary stents also appear to be cost-effective. On preliminary analysis, ACE inhibition dominates for CHF, ie saves money and lives. Heart transplant appears to be cost-effective, but requires further study. For arrhythmias, implantable cardioverter defibrillators are cost-effective, especially the transvenous device, in life-threatening situations; radiofrequency ablation is also cost-effective in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, apart from asymptomatic individuals; and pacemakers have not been analyzed except in the case of biofascicular block, where the results were variable depending on the situation and previous tests.",0,0

The present study examined whether regression of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy by long-term treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) affects plasma BNP concentration in patients with essential hypertension.; Thirty-one hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy were treated with ACE inhibitors (16 enalapril; 15 lisinopril) for 1 year. Serial changes in LV mass index, LV systolic function, and plasma concentrations of BNP and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were recorded; ACEI treatment significantly reduced LV mass index at 6 months, and even more so at 1 year. Septal and posterior wall thicknesses were also reduced. Plasma BNP and ANP were markedly elevated at baseline, but only BNP levels correlated with LV mass index. Both peptide levels decreased after 6 months, and this decrease increased after 1 year. There was a close relationship between BNP reduction and LV mass index reduction overall and with enalapril and lisinopril separately. Changes in ANP and LV mass index were not related.; Long-term ACEI therapy can reduce elevated plasma BNP. In this study, changes in BNP reflected the magnitude of LVH regression.

Comparison with nifedipine.,,"Shimamoto, H; Shimamoto, Y","We compared the systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of nifedipine and lisinopril in 26 elderly hypertensive patients using the pulsed Doppler ultrasound technique. Nifedipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist and lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The study had a single-blind crossover design: nifedipine and lisinopril were administered for 8 weeks each after 4-week washout periods. Both nifedipine and lisinopril significantly reduced mean arterial pressure to the same extent (p < 0.01); cardiac output was unchanged in the groups treated with nifedipine and lisinopril. Lisinopril significantly increased renal flow (p < 0.01), but nifedipine did not. The flows of the common carotid, vertebral, celiac and superior mesenteric arteries and of the diaphragmatic and terminal aorta did not show a significant change with neither nifedipine nor lisinopril. The specific action of lisinopril on the thoracic aorta was a marked improvement in aortic compliance compared to nifedipine, which could be partly responsible for the increase in renal flow. Lisinopril may provide more desirable regional hemodynamic effects and additional benefits for elderly hypertensive patients.",0,0

This study determined the incidence of cough in hypertensive patients and CHF treated with ACE-I and to appreciate its clinical significance; 268 patients treated with ACE-I, 164 with hypertension and 104 with CHF, were followed prospectively for at least 1 year and specifically asked about cough and other side effects. In those who developed a cough, a second and then a third ACE-I was tried. Cough developed in 50 (18.6%) of the 268 patients; 23 hypertensive patients (14%) had cough 24.7 +/- 17.1 (SD) weeks after initiation of therapy; 27 patients with CHF (26%) had cough 12.3 +/- 12 (SD) weeks after initiation of ACE-I therapy (P = 0.005).

This study was designed to see if a low-fat diet altered the favorable effect of doxazosin on blood lipids in adults with mild-to-moderate hypertension and mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia (5.6-8.0 mmol/L). . After a six-week period on a low-fat diet, patients were randomly assigned to additional treatment with doxazosin (2-8 mg/day) or enalapril (5-20 mg/day) for a further 10 weeks. Forty-four of 55 subjects completed the study. A low-fat diet reduced mean body weight by 2 kg without significantly altering blood lipids (total and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides). Doxazosin (4.5 +/- 2.9 mg/day) and enalapril (12.5 +/- 6.5 mg/day) produced comparable reduction in sitting and standing BP at all visits and also produced similar BP control at 24 hours. The expected increase in HDL cholesterol concentration previously observed in this patient population in association with doxazosin treatment was not detected, suggesting that the low-cholesterol, high-carbohydrate diet, at least acutely, attenuates this effect. potentially beneficial on plasma lipids. In summary, doxazosin has comparable tolerability and BP-lowering ability to enalapril. However, its ability to raise HDL cholesterol may be reduced in patients on low-fat diets.",0,0

Left ventricular and neurohormonal function data (radionuclide angiography) were obtained in 19 patients with symptomatic ischemic heart failure. Measurements were repeated after 4 to 6 weeks of therapy with the dopamine agonist ibopamine (100 mg, 3 times daily) or placebo administered in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group design. At baseline, despite enalapril treatment, angiotensin II levels (mean 39.4 pg/ml; p < 0.01 vs. controls) were significantly increased, as was plasma norepinephrine (497 +/ - 240 pg/ml, p < 0.01 vs. controls), endothelin-1, atrial natriuretic peptide, and arginine vasopressin. In addition, compared with pretreatment values, left ventricular ejection fraction was substantially decreased (-9.1%) in patients with plasma norepinephrine > or = 600 pg/mL, but not in those with lower values of norepinephrine. norepinephrine. With ibopamine, plasma norepinephrine decreased from 516 +/- 241 to 391 +/- 208 pg/ml (n = 8, p < 0.025 vs. placebo), whereas it increased with placebo. In conclusion, the neurohormonal control provided by an ACE inhibitor is reduced in a large subset of patients during prolonged therapy; Ibopamine appears to be a potentially useful drug to improve neurohormonal control in this context.",0,0

Predominance of CD8+ T cells was observed in the epidermal infiltrates, reduction in the number of OKT6+ epidermal dendritic cells (Langerhans cells) and increased expression of HLA-DR and ICAM-1 in keratinocytes in the acute phase of the GVHR type, but not either the chronic phase GVHR type or the acute non-GVHR type. These findings were similar to previous reports of acute GVH disease (GVHD) skin lesions seen after bone marrow transplantation. Therefore, immunohistochemistry is not useful for the differential diagnosis between GVHR-type acute drug eruptions and acute cutaneous GVHD. These findings also indicate that similar immunomechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of GVHR-type drug eruptions and cutaneous GVHD.",0,0

Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'infarto Miocardico.,,,"GISSI-3 is a multicenter randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of lisinopril, transdermal glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), and their combination in improving survival and ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Between June 1991 and July 1993, 19,394 patients from 200 coronary care units in Italy were randomized. Eligible patients presented within 24 hours of symptom onset and had no clear indications for or against study treatments. In a factorial design, patients were randomly assigned 6 weeks of oral lisinopril (initial dose 5 mg then 10 mg daily) or open-label control, as well as nitrates (intravenous for the first 24 hours followed by transdermal GTN 10 mg). per day) or open control. Complete clinical data and 6-week follow-up were available for 18,895 (97.4%) randomized patients. Two-dimensional echocardiographic data were available for 14,209 patients. Overall mortality at 6 weeks was 6.7%. Lisinopril, started within 24 hours of AMI symptoms, produced significant reductions in overall mortality (odds ratio 0.88 [95% CI 0.79-0.99]) and in the pooled outcome measure of mortality and severe ventricular dysfunction (0.90 [0.84-0.98]). In the same trial, routine administration of transdermal GTN showed no independent effect on the same outcomes (0.94 [0.84-1.05] and 0.94 [0.87-1.02]). Systematic combined administration of lisinopril and GTN also produced significant reductions in overall mortality (0.83 [0.70-0.97]) and in the combined endpoint (0.85 [0.76-0.94]). . The favorable effect of lisinopril alone or with GTN was also clear in predefined high-risk populations (elderly and female patients) for the combined endpoint. These findings were obtained in a population intensively exposed to the recommended treatments (thrombolysis 72%, beta-blockade 31% and aspirin 84%); Non-protocol treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and nitrates was allowed for specific clinical indications. No excess of clinically relevant adverse events were reported in the treated groups.",1,1

When treated with a calcium channel blocker, the glomerular filtration fraction was 0.26 and massive proteinuria ranging from 10 to 15 g/day persisted. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor markedly reduced proteinuria to 1-2 g/day with a filtration fraction of 0.20. After changing the antihypertensive drug to a beta-blocker, the filtration fraction was 0.23 and urinary protein excretion was 3-4 g/day. Blood pressure control was comparable with each drug.

Historically, the complexity of these disorders has been compounded by imprecision in terminology and classification and the presence or absence of underlying systemic disease. It is hoped that addressing the literature with consistent diagnostic limitations and accepted terminology can remove some of the ambiguity. Over the past year, several case reports and brief communications on cutaneous vasculitis or vasculopathies have appeared, as well as thoughtful basic science reports whose authors have attempted to further our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. Recent technological advances have produced recombinant cytokines, growth factors, and thrombolytics that have been used therapeutically for a variety of medical conditions. The role of these agents in the treatment of cutaneous vasculitis and vascular diseases has ranged from provocative in some to therapeutic in others. Several of these reports are discussed.",0,0

The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study demonstrated that captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, improves survival and decreases the development of severe heart failure in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%) but without overt postinfarction heart failure. failure.; In 534 patients in the SAVE study, plasma neurohormone levels were measured a mean of 12 days after infarction. Patients were then randomized to captopril or placebo and followed for a mean (+/- SD) of 38 +/- 6 months (range 24 to 55). The association between plasma neurohormone activation at baseline and subsequent cardiovascular mortality or development of heart failure was assessed with and without adjustment for other important prognostic factors; By univariate analysis, activation of plasma renin activity and levels of aldosterone, norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic peptide, and arginine vasopressin were associated with subsequent cardiovascular events, whereas epinephrine and dopamine levels were not. Using multivariate analysis, only plasma renin activity (relative risk 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0 to 2.5) and atrial natriuretic peptide (relative risk 2.2, CI 95%: 1.3 to 3.8) independently predicted cardiovascular mortality, whereas the other neurohormones were not. Only plasma renin and aldosterone activity, atrial natriuretic peptide, and arginine vasopressin were independent predictors of the combined end points of cardiovascular mortality, development of severe heart failure, or recurrent myocardial infarction. Except for cardiovascular mortality at one year, the use of captopril did not significantly modify these relationships; Neurohumoral activation at hospital discharge in postinfarction patients is an independent sign of poor prognosis. This is particularly true for plasma renin activity and atrial natriuretic peptide. Except for cardiovascular mortality at 1 year, captopril does not significantly modify these relationships.",0,0
1543,7917078,Adverse effects of alpha 1-adrenergic blockers.,,"Carruthers, S G","Previous nonselective alpha 1 adrenergic blockers, such as phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine, are now restricted to drug treatment of alpha 1 adrenergic crisis and pheochromocytoma. Prazosin, the first selective alpha 1 blocker approved for the treatment of hypertension, became available in the mid-1970s. Additional alpha 1 blockers, such as doxazosin and terazosin, have been introduced in recent years. The undesirable effects of all members of this class are similar. Most adverse events can be attributed to reversible competitive antagonism of postsynaptic alpha 1 adrenergic receptors in tissues that maintain high levels of sympathetic alpha adrenergic tone, for example, resistance arteries, capacitance veins, and the urinary bladder outflow tract. . Orthostatic hypotension with a feeling of severe fainting and occasional syncope may occur shortly after the initial dose. Aggravating factors include upright posture, intravascular volume depletion, and concomitant administration of other blood pressure-lowering drugs, including all other classes of antihypertensive drugs. The problem is reduced or avoided by choosing low starting doses, starting treatment at bedtime, and minimizing other risks. Among the general adverse effects, asthenia, dizziness, fainting, and syncope predominate and occur in 10% to 20% of patients, leading to treatment discontinuation in approximately half that number. Uncommon adverse events include headache, drowsiness, palpitations, urinary incontinence, and priapism. Some patients experience a body weight gain of 1 to 2 kg which may be associated with secondary hyperaldosteronism. Tolerance to the benefits of alpha 1 blockade appears to develop in patients with congestive heart failure, but not in hypertension. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED IN 250 WORDS)",0,0

All antihypertensive agents reduced baseline mean arterial pressure equally and did not change forearm vascular resistance compared to placebo. In response to sustained gripping exercise, both quinapril and verapamil, but not atenolol, attenuated the pressor response. However, verapamil was associated with an exaggerated increase in forearm vascular resistance during handgripping, whereas quinapril did not alter this response compared to placebo. It is concluded that quinapril and verapamil reduce the pressor response during isometric exercise due to quantitatively different effects on the vasoconstrictor response inside and outside of skeletal muscles.",0,0

The patient was a non-smoker with no respiratory diseases. The cough continued during quinapril therapy. One month after switching to fosinopril therapy, the patient reports complete resolution of the cough. She remains cough free to date.; ACE inhibitor-induced cough is a frequently documented adverse effect. It is severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in 1 to 10 percent of patients. Cough is considered a class-related adverse effect with routinely reported cross-reactions between ACE inhibitors. Switching to another ACE inhibitor or additional NSAID therapy is not recommended at this time. Withdrawal of the ACE inhibitor produces rapid relief of cough, although this is not always necessary as most patients may experience a cessation or decrease in cough. We present a case of cough after administration of quinapril, with complete resolution after switching to the alternative ACE inhibitor fosinopril in a patient with essential hypertension; Cough has been commonly encountered after administration of ACE inhibitors. The frequency of cough is variable and, although this complication has been described as a class effect, patients with severe persistent cough induced by ACE inhibitors may benefit from a trial of fosinopril treatment. This may be particularly useful in patients who cannot tolerate an alternative class of antihypertensive agents.",0,0

Seventy-four of the original 127 patients treated with atenolol met the criteria to enter the 4-week double-blind phase of the study, in which benazepril 10 mg twice daily (increased after 1 week, if necessary, to 20 mg twice daily) or placebo was added to atenolol. At the end, 46% of the benazepril group had achieved an excellent or good response (ie, diastolic blood pressure [DBP] < 90 mm Hg or a decrease of > or = 10 mm Hg below baseline) compared to 14% of the benazepril group. placebo group (P < 0.01). The mean drop in DBP at the end of the study was -5.6 mm Hg in the benazepril group and -3.7 mm Hg in the placebo group. Because six patients in the benazepril group experienced an increase in blood pressure that offset the drop seen in responders, the difference in DBP response between the benazepril group and the placebo group was not statistically significant. We conclude that the addition of benazepril to the regimen of patients whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled while receiving atenolol monotherapy may produce additional blood pressure lowering in almost half of the patients.",0,0

The purpose of this study was to determine predictors of recurrent myocardial infarction in study participants and to examine the influence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on this and other myocardial ischemic events.; All 2231 patients had survived the acute phase of myocardial infarction (3 to 16 days) and had a radionuclide ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%. Patients were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with placebo or captopril and were followed up for an average of 42 months. The influence of captopril on recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiac revascularization procedures, and hospitalization for unstable angina were examined. The probability of recurrent myocardial infarction was higher in patients with myocardial infarction or functional disability before the index infarction and higher systolic pressure (all P < 0.001), but was not influenced by the initial left ventricular ejection fraction. Captopril therapy reduced the risk of developing recurrent myocardial infarction by 25% (95% confidence intervals, 5% to 40%; P = 0.015) and the risk of death after recurrent myocardial infarction by 32%. % (95% confidence intervals, 4% to 51%, p = 0.029). Patients assigned to captopril were also less likely to require cardiac revascularization procedures (p = 0.010), but hospitalization for unstable angina was unchanged. When these three major coronary ischemic events were considered together, captopril therapy reduced risk (14% risk reduction; 95% confidence intervals, 0% to 26%; P = .047); In post-MI patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, long-term administration of captopril reduced MI recurrence and the need for cardiac revascularization, but did not influence the rate of hospitalization with a discharge diagnosis of unstable angina. The finding that recurrence of myocardial infarction was independent of left ventricular ejection fraction suggests that captopril might be useful in preventing recurrent myocardial infarction in patients with more preserved left ventricular function. The need for cardiac revascularization was reduced in patients receiving long-term captopril, suggesting an anti-ischemic effect or the ability of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor to modify the atherosclerotic process in survivors of myocardial infarction.",1,1

This has been shown in studies with conventional antihypertensive treatment as well as with ACE inhibitors. It remains to be shown whether this last group of drugs is more effective and was the objective of our study. In a prospective randomized study, we compared the effects of ACE inhibition and beta-blockade in slowing the progression of renal function in IDDM patients with early-stage overt diabetic nephropathy. Twenty-nine patients were studied for 2 years, 15 were randomized to treatment with captopril and 14 to atenolol. Every 6 weeks blood pressure and urinary albumin and total protein excretion were measured. GFR was measured every 6 months as 51Cr-EDTA clearance. Baseline blood pressure, renal function, and albuminuria values were identical in the two groups. The effect of both drugs on blood pressure was not significantly different. In captopril-treated patients, MAP before and after 2 years was 110 +/- 3 (SEM) and 100 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively, and in atenolol-treated patients 105 +/- 2 vs. 101 +/- 2mm Hg.

This may be due to the use of different doses of ACE inhibitor, different renal pathology, and non-standardized sodium intake. In 16 proteinuric patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy, normal renal function and blood pressure, maintained on controlled sodium intake < or = 80 mEqII, the efficacy of escalating doses of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril was studied. Lisinopril doses were 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg, administered for 4 weeks. A 3-week placebo period was interposed between each dose increment. Proteinuria gradually decreased from the control period by 39%, 44%, 61%, and 67% with lisinopril at doses of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg, respectively. Blood pressure decreased 22% with lisinopril 5 mg; a similar drop was observed with increasing dose. Although the glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged, the renal plasma flow increased by 21%, 26%, 24%, and 28%, and the filtration fraction increased by 28% on average. Plasma levels of ACE decreased by 33%, 64%, 76% and 83%. A close correlation was found between an increase in the dose of lisinopril and a decrease in urinary protein excretion (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). The antiproteinuric effect of lisinopril is dose related and can be attributed to some extent to the fall in systemic (and intraglomerular) blood pressure, but is better attributed to the modification of the glomerular screening function.

Because the renin-angiotensin system may be activated in chronic aortic regurgitation, early therapy with enalapril might be beneficial.; Between 1990 and 1993, 76 asymptomatic nonrheumatic patients with mild to severe chronic aortic regurgitation were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized trial comparing enalapril with hydralazine. All patients underwent serial noninvasive studies. Seventy patients completed the 12-month follow-up.; At 1 year, patients receiving enalapril had a significant reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indices (124 +/- 15 vs. 108 +/- 17 mL/m2, p < 0.01, 50 +/- 12 vs. .40 +/- 14 ml/m2, p < 0.01, respectively) and mass index (131 +/- 16 vs. 113 +/- 19 g/m2, p < 0.01), while that hydralazine therapy showed no significant changes. Both regimens not only had a significant reduction in left ventricular midwall stress, but also had a slight increase in exercise duration. Only enalapril therapy achieved significant inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, in contrast to hydralazine therapy. In addition, the multiple r2 value of the end-diastolic volume index analysis using the two variables of age and treatment drugs was 72.1% (p < 0.01); Both regimens decrease mean left ventricular wall stress. Treatment with enalapril achieves a significant regression of left ventricular mass, a reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume index, and suppression of the renin-angiotensin system. These findings suggest that early release enalapril therapy has the potential to favorably influence the natural history of chronic AR.",0,0

Fourteen patients withdrew from therapy; six patients withdrew due to adverse events (lisinopril, n = 3; diltiazem SR, n = 1) and lack of BP control (lisinopril, n = 1; diltiazem SR, n = 1). Both monotherapies were titrated up (lisinopril 20-40 mg daily, diltiazem SR 120-180 mg twice daily) to achieve an office DBP < 90 mmHg. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; 25 mg daily) was added to monotherapy after week 4 if patients did not reach target BP (ie, non-responders). After four weeks of therapy, 72% of patients (74 of 103) did not respond. At eight weeks of treatment, 66 patients (lisinopril, n = 32; diltiazem SR, n = 34) had received HCTZ. At week 8, 53% of lisinopril patients and 36% of diltiazem SR patients met response criteria. Mean office DBP decreased from baseline -18.1 +/- 8.6 mmHg for lisinopril patients and -15.9 +/- 10.1 mmHg for diltiazem SR patients at week 8. Lisinopril it was as effective as diltiazem in lowering office systolic and diastolic BP at week 4 (p > 0.1). Likewise, at weeks 4 and 8, no statistically significant differences were detected between treatments (p > 0.05) for 24-hour averaged diastolic and systolic ambulatory BP. Both treatments were well tolerated and showed significant antihypertensive efficacy in patients with moderate to severe BP elevation.",0,0

The study was controlled by standard office blood pressure measurements, clinical and laboratory evaluation. 24 patients of both sexes and between 18 and 70 years of age with essential hypertension were enrolled, 20 met the randomization criteria (seated diastolic pressure 95-115 mmHg), 3 withdrew from the study during its active phase and one was excluded from the analysis due to having found retrospectively not to have met the criteria for randomisation at the appropriate visit. The default endpoints were blood pressure levels during different time periods of ambulatory monitoring performed at the end of each treatment or placebo phase; In the 17 patients who completed the protocol, lisinopril produced a greater reduction in blood pressure at all time periods, although the differences were not all statistically significant. The differences were most marked 19-24 hours after dosing when pressures (systolic/diastolic) during lisinopril treatment were lower than during captopril by 18.0/14.5 mmHg (p < 0.001 for both). As measured by clinical pressures, lisinopril also achieved a considerably greater degree of blood pressure control with less dose adjustment; In this study, lisinopril was shown to be a more effective once-daily antihypertensive agent than captopril, especially in the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval.",1,0

The change in serum potassium correlated with the change in initial insulin response and rate of glucose disappearance in IVGTT, and was inversely correlated with the change in AUCglucose in OGTT. In conclusion, alterations in serum potassium balance may affect initial insulin release and glucose disposal. Treatment with bendrofluazide lowers serum potassium concentration, reduces initial insulin release and glucose disposal, and also alters insulin sensitivity. Lisinopril treatment increases serum potassium concentration and initial insulin response, and decreases AUCglucose, but does not improve insulin sensitivity per se.",0,0

To date, no study has allowed a true comparison of these drugs in this regard and with respect to their potential to lower circadian blood pressure. Thus, a total of 86 patients with newly diagnosed arterial hypertension and echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy underwent randomized treatment with captopril (n = 43) or nitrendipine (n = 43). Eighteen patients had to receive a combination therapy of nitrendipine and captopril during the course of the study to control blood pressure effectively. Before and after weeks 6 and 38 of treatment, all patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, M-mode echo assessment of left ventricular mass, and Doppler assessment of left ventricular filling. The 24-hour blood pressure data were smoothed with a Fourier series and then compared to a normotensive reference profile with respect to blood pressure load and variability. Mean daytime and nighttime blood pressure and office blood pressure were also analyzed. Substance-specific action profiles were obtained by subtracting the smoothed profiles after therapy from the profiles before therapy. After 38 weeks, ambulatory blood pressure had decreased from 152 +/- 11/101 +/- 7 to 137 +/- 13/87 +/- 10 mm Hg with nitrendipine and from 147 +/- 11/99 +/- - 6 to 134 +/- 13/89 +/- 9 mm Hg in captopril. The calculated substance-specific profiles for captopril and nitrendipine showed a balanced antihypertensive effect during the day and night. The mean percentage decrease in left ventricular muscle mass with nitrendipine was 15% and did not differ significantly from the 21% decrease with captopril treatment (p < 0.001). There is no significant association between blood pressure reduction and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. In patients with impaired left ventricular diastolic function, early to late diastolic left ventricular flow ratio and isovolumetric relaxation time were improved regardless of the drug used. We conclude that long-term therapy with captopril and nitrendipine leads to a comparable degree of reduction in circadian blood pressure and regression of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy.",0,0

Prior to these 16 weeks there was a placebo washout period of 2 to 6 weeks. Measurements of blood pressure, euglycemia, hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps, and intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) were performed at baseline and after 4 and 16 weeks. Blood lipid status was assessed at baseline and at 16 weeks. Insulin sensitivity index (M/I) increased by 12% during the extended placebo period and subsequently decreased by 12% during atenolol treatment in that group. A post-hoc analysis of covariance indicated that the increase in insulin sensitivity during the initial 4 weeks may be due to carryover effects of previous antihypertensive treatment. Fosinopril increased glucose disappearance during IVGTT at 4 and 16 weeks (k values 1.46 and 1.33 vs. 1.10 at baseline) but had no effect on insulin sensitivity. The change in insulin sensitivity and serum triglycerides during fosinopril treatment was related to inhibition of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme. In conclusion, carryover effects of previous antihypertensive medication were suggested in this study, probably due to insufficient washout period in many patients.

Captopril and placebo did not alter cough response compared to baseline. However, glycopyrrolate caused a significant increase in sensitivity threshold (D2) from baseline and a significant decrease in total cough response at 40 and 60 minutes, both after captopril and placebo.

Elimination of vagal influences implies attenuation of the effects of tachykinins but not of prostaglandins. We postulate that tachykinins, like substance P, play a more important role than prostaglandins in capsaicin-induced cough. We conclude that the vagus nerve is important in the capsaicin-induced cough reflex, but since suppression of this reflex by glycopyrrolate was delayed, the relevant receptors are poorly accessible peripheral receptors or are located in the Central Nervous System.",0,0

In the present study, 65 of the original 149 patients with essential hypertension included in the short-term studies were re-examined after treatment for 2 to 3 years. The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp method showed that the significant decrease in insulin sensitivity (p < 0.01) induced by treatment with pindolol, propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol, or hydrochlorothiazide after 4 to 6 months persisted after 2 to 3 months. years of treatment. Furthermore, the increase in insulin sensitivity reported for captopril after 6 months (p < 0.05) did not change significantly during long-term treatment. In addition, elevated levels of very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (p < 0.01) and reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.01) induced by the majority of beta-adrenergic blockade persisted without activity. intrinsic sympathomimetic and hydrochlorothiazide. Captopril, on the other hand, did not significantly affect lipids during prolonged treatment.

With exercise, LV filling measures were not different between healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. In hypertensive patients at rest, compared with before treatment, long isovolumetric duration lisinopril and verapamil had no effect on LV filling; at 50% maximal exercise compared to before treatment, verapamil shortened the time to maximal filling rate and isovolumetric duration and increased the first-half filling fraction but, at 70% maximal exercise, verapamil did not had an effect, whereas lisinopril did not alter LV filling during exercise. any level of exercise.

Insulin resistance (IR), described as the common link between these disorders, could contribute to increased coronary risk. The euglycemic insulin clamp technique has been used to demonstrate that different classes of antihypertensive agents have different effects on IR. The purpose of this multicenter study was to compare the effects of captopril with those of nicardipine on the insulin profile using the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a routine feasible test. After a 1-month single-blind placebo period, 154 patients with android hypertension and obesity were randomized to 3 months of double-blind therapy with captopril 50 mg twice daily (n = 77) or nicardipine 50 mg twice daily. day n = 77).

In patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure in NYHA IV, an optional protocol was designed in the CONSENSUS-I trial to determine if there were differences in patient characteristics with respect to LVD grade defined as fractional shortening (FS) of the left ventricle . A subgroup of 54 patients from the CONSENSUS-I trial were evaluated with M-mode echocardiography. Patients with FS above the median (14%) were older (74 +/- 7 vs. 68 +/- 7, p < 0 .01), more often women (48% vs. 15%, p < 0.05), and had lower heart rates (77 +/- 15 vs. 95 +/- 17, p < 0.01). An analysis of the 2-year follow-up from the end of the trial was also performed. In the placebo group, patients with FS > 14% had a significantly better prognosis than patients with FS < 14%. No such difference in survival was observed in the enalapril-treated group. The difference between the original treatment groups remained, despite enalapril treatment being made available to all surviving patients. In conclusion, patients with advanced chronic congestive heart failure and less severe LVD have different demographic characteristics than patients with more severe LVD.

The study comprised 36 women (age 46-85 years, mean 68) and 96 men (age 39-81 years, mean 62). Quality of life did not differ significantly between patients treated with enalapril versus placebo. The scores were (enalapril vs placebo, mean +/- SE): mean NHP 15.4 +/- 2.3 vs 17.1 +/- 2.3; PSDI 9.5 +/- 1.0 vs. 10.8 +/- 0.9; WPS 19.8 +/- 2.0 vs. 19.4 +/- 1.4; LSI 24.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 22.5 +/- 1.4.

In vitro tests for drug sensitization of lymphocytes are considered to be of low sensitivity. We investigated the possibility of detecting lymphocyte drug reactivity in drug-induced hepatitis by analyzing lymphocyte proliferative responses to drug antigens or metabolites ex vivo to improve test sensitivity in vitro. Lymphocyte proliferative responses to five different drug concentrations and to drug antigens ex vivo (serum collected from normal subjects after drug ingestion) were analyzed in 25 patients with a clinical diagnosis of drug-induced hepatitis, 27 healthy subjects, and 10 individuals. with recent exposure to the same medications without development of adverse drug reactions. Lymphocyte drug reactivity was detected in seven of the 25 patients (28%). The use of sera collected from healthy volunteers after drug intake (drug antigens ex vivo) and the addition of a prostaglandin inhibitor to the cultures allowed the detection of lymphocyte sensitization in seven additional cases, increasing the detection capacity of 28 % to 56%.

Assessment by acute inhibition of renin and converting enzyme.,,"Kiowski, W; Beermann, J; Rickenbacher, P; Haemmerli, R; Thomas, M; Burkart, F; Meinertz, T","The contribution of non-angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to their hemodynamic effects in patients with chronic heart failure is unclear. A comparison of the effects of renin converting enzyme inhibition should help clarify this issue.; Thirty-six patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class II or III) were randomly assigned to receive double-blind intravenous placebo, the renin inhibitor remikiren, or the renin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat followed by co-infusion of a second placebo infusion. the addition of remikiren to enalaprilat, or the addition of enalaprilat to remikiren, respectively. Systemic hemodynamics (Swan-Ganz and radial artery catheters) were measured before (rest and submaximal recumbent bicycle ergometry), during (rest), and at the end (rest and exercise) of each single or combined 45-day infusion period. minutes. Placebo did not change hemodynamics or renin activity. Effective inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by remikiren and enalaprilat was indicated by increases in plasma immunoreactive renin together with a rapid and complete inhibition of renin activity after remikiren and an increase after enalaprilat (all P < or = 0, 05). Remikiren and enalaprilat rapidly and to a similar degree lowered resting blood pressure through a reduction in systemic vascular resistance, and these changes correlated significantly with baseline plasma renin activity. Both compounds also reduced pulmonary artery, pulmonary capillary, and right atrial pressures to a similar extent (p < 0.05). During exercise, right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were equally reduced and stroke volume index increased with remikiren and enalaprilat (p < 0.05 for both). The combination of converting enzyme with renin inhibition or vice versa did not cause additional hemodynamic changes; Specific renin inhibition in patients with chronic heart failure produces short-term hemodynamic effects that are almost indistinguishable from those of renin-converting enzyme inhibition. This finding and the lack of additional effects of renin-converting enzyme inhibition added to renin inhibition suggest that the non-angiotensin effects of renin-converting enzyme inhibitors do not play an important role in their short-term hemodynamic effects in patients with chronic heart failure.",0,0

Repeated measurements of the following parameters were performed: BP (mercury sphygmomanometry), left ventricular mass (LVM, echocardiography), cardiac output (aortic cross section and velocity integral), total peripheral resistance (cardiac output and mean BP), aorta and high arterial distensibility (pulse wave velocity, Doppler flowmeter) and arterial wave reflexes (magnification index, applanation tonometry). A radioimmunoassay was used to determine plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and plasma catecholamine levels. Two-way ANOVA (time treatment) for repeated measures was used for statistical analysis. Perindopril and nitrendipine induced similar and significant decreases in BP, total peripheral resistance (P < 0.001), aortic and arterial pulse wave velocities (P < 0.001), and arterial wave reflexes (P < 0.01).

However, adverse skin reactions, such as angioneurotic edema, have been reported after such medication. Furthermore, these drugs have been associated with a persistent dry cough in subjects without prior known bronchial hyperresponsiveness. There are reasons to believe that ACE inhibitor-induced cough is due to an irritating inflammatory state in the airways of susceptible individuals and that this might have pathophysiological features in common with cough seen as an early symptom of asthma. All inflammatory responses (wheal and rash reactions, airway reactivity, and infiltration by neutrophils and eosinophils) were increased by ACE inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner.

Sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced by 6 and 5 mmHg more with lisinopril than with nifedipine during 12 weeks of monotherapy. After 12 weeks, a greater proportion of patients taking lisinopril were controlled (sitting diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg) than those taking nifedipine. As a result, 17% of those taking lisinopril and 38% of those taking nifedipine required additional hydrochlorothiazide therapy. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide resulted in similar response rates in the lisinopril and nifedipine groups (89% and 75%, respectively). The reporting rate of adverse events considered drug-related and the withdrawal rate were similar for both treatments. Cough was more frequent with lisinopril and headache, sweating, and hot flushes with nifedipine.

However, interobserver variation in patients may be more difficult than in normal subjects. In a multicenter study, 85 patients from 10 centers performed a total of 331 maximal bicycle tests (ramp protocols, 10 watts.min-1) with respiratory gas analysis by different systems. A central committee reviewed all the evidence. The AT determination percentages ranged between 34% and 71% depending on the method used. Apart from the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) method, which gave the lowest determination rate: 34%, and the crossover point (when RER = 1), which gave the highest rate, 71%, other methods of determination, such as carbon dioxide (42%), minute ventilation (52%), or ventilatory equivalents plotted against time (57%), did not differ in BP determination rate. Therefore, even among trained clinicians, AT determination was unreliable. However, the crossover point can be a valuable index from a pragmatic point of view, even if it occurs after the actual AT.

Therefore, it is of interest to study neurohormonal activation during different physiological conditions. Plasma neurohormones were measured in 54 patients treated with diuretics for mild or moderate CHF. Samples were taken at rest and immediately after maximal cycling exercise, before and after 12 weeks of treatment with ramipril or placebo. There was a strong correlation between plasma levels of each hormone before and after exercise. There was an inverse correlation at baseline between exercise duration and angiotensin II levels after maximal exercise (r = -0.30, P = 0.03), but not at rest. Plasma levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and norepinephrine increased after maximal exercise compared with rest. Plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and ANP were reduced by ramipril compared with placebo, both at rest and after exercise, but angiotensin II, aldosterone, and norepinephrine levels were not significantly affected. Therefore, exercise constantly activates the neurohormonal systems in patients with CHF. Patients with the shortest duration of exercise had the highest levels of angiotensin II after exercise. Plasma neurohormone measurements after maximal exercise provide limited additional value to measurements at rest.",0,0

The oxazepam was taken only on the seventh day and the placebo was taken on the previous six days. On the seventh day, the central effects of the drugs were tested at 10.00-11.00 h (session 1), immediately before the subjects' last dose of each drug and at 2.5-3.5 h after the dose. end of each drug (1330-1430 h, session 2). Performance was assessed using digit symbol substitution, sustained attention, letter cancellation, choice reaction time, finger tapping, immediate and short-term memory, critical blink fusion, and memory fusion. two flashes. Subjects rated their mood and well-being on a series of 12 visual analog scales. EEG and body sway recordings were made. Neither atenolol nor captopril altered performance in any of the skills tested. There were no effects on subjectively assessed alertness or mood with captopril, whereas atenolol significantly increased wakefulness in session 2 and when both sessions were proposed. Similarly, captopril did not change body sway, whereas with atenolol there was a significant decrease in activity in the frequency range 1.0-2.75 Hz from session 1 to session 2.

Abnormal endogenous fibrinolysis, reflected in elevated levels of endogenous tissue-type plasminogen activator antigen (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 activity, is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction in patients with ischemic heart disease; In a randomized double-blind crossover study beginning 8 weeks after uncomplicated myocardial infarction, patients received 4 weeks of placebo and 4 weeks of captopril (75 mg daily). At the end of each treatment period, we measured t-PA antigen and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 antigen and activity; The median values in the 15 patients after placebo and in 12 normal men matched for age and body mass index were, respectively, t-PA antigen 16.0 vs. 9.5 ng/mL (p = 0.001), inhibitory antigen type 1 plasminogen activator activity 17.3 vs. 8.6 ng/mL (p = 0.29) and type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor activity 13.2 vs. 6.3 AU/mL (p = 0, 04). After 4 weeks of captopril treatment in all 15 patients, the estimated median (95% confidence interval) reduction in t-PA antigen was 7.3 ng/mL (-4.6 to -10.3 ng /ml, p = 0.001), in the type 1 antigen plasminogen activator inhibitor 3.1 ng/ml (+1.5 to -8.4 ng/ml, p = 0.17) and in the activity of the inhibitor plasminogen activator type 1 -2.2 AU/ml (-1.0 to -4.3 AU/ml, p = 0.02). ; Captopril treatment after uncomplicated myocardial infarction is associated with a significant decrease in elevated t-PA antigen levels and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 activity.

Quinapril Research Group.,,"Canter, D; Frank, G J; Knapp, L E; Phelps, M; Quade, M; Texter, M","In this multicenter trial, a factorial design method of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril hydrochloride (Accupril) in combination with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) was applied to assess the additive effects of the combination versus monotherapy, to characterize the dose-response relationship of each drug in the presence of the other and determine whether quinapril would attenuate the hypokalemic effect of HCTZ. After a two- to four-week placebo run-in period, 460 qualified patients with DBP > or = 100 mmHg and < or = 115 mmHg were randomized to an eight-week double-blind phase with one of 16 parallel treatments: placebo, one of three doses of quinapril monotherapy, one of three doses of HCTZ monotherapy, or one of nine possible corresponding combinations of quinapril and HCTZ. Mean reductions in seated SBP/DBP at trough with combined treatment ranged from 7.8 mmHg/7.2 mmHg to 19.6 mmHg/15.1 mmHg (n = 458). The results of the response surface analyzes indicate that the effects of the two drugs were additive and that the maximum antihypertensive effect of quinapril in combination with HCTZ within the doses studied is reached approximately at a dose of 26 mg of quinapril and 25 mg of quinapril. of HCTZ. The degree of attenuation of the hypokalaemic effect of HCTZ was directly related to the dose of quinapril. With 40 mg quinapril, dose-related decreases in serum potassium of HCTZ were not apparent and general hypokalemic effects were attenuated by quinapril. Thus, the combination of quinapril and HCTZ given once daily provided additive antihypertensive effects of predictable degrees, and the addition of quinapril attenuated the hypokalemic effect of HCTZ.",0,0
1602,8008712,Differential gastrointestinal site absorption of benazepril hydrochloride in healthy volunteers.,,"Chan, K K; Buch, A; Glazer, R D; John, V A; Barr, W H","The absorption of benazepril-HCl (BZPH), an orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was investigated in various regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract using an intestinal intubation technique. Thirteen subjects completed this single dose triphasic sequential crossover study. The drug (20 mg) was administered as a 4-hour colonic infusion (COLON) or as a small intestine infusion (SI) in the first two phases and as an oral bolus solution (ORAL) in the third phase, with a duration of 2 -week washing between each treatment. Serial plasma and urine samples were collected up to 4 days after dosing. BZPH and its active metabolite benazeprilat (BZPL) were determined using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method. BZPH was rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream (Tmax = 0.5 h after ORAL). Absorption was also rapid for SI, with a post-infusion half-life (0.57h) almost identical to ORAL (0.59h). The rate of absorption after COLON was much slower (lower Cmax and longer Tmax) compared to SI, and the apparent half-life (1.7 hours) was prolonged. SI delivered 90%, while COLON delivered 23% of the drug into the systemic circulation compared to ORAL. BZPL was rapidly formed upon absorption of the drug. Metabolite-to-drug AUC ratios were comparable for SI and ORAL (8.9 vs. 9.7), indicating that first-pass metabolism of BZPH was neither saturable nor input rate-dependent. The metabolite-to-drug AUC ratio was reduced for COLON (5.0), indicating that the absorption mechanism of BZPH in the colon may be different than after SI and ORAL. Urinary recovery data were consistent with plasma data. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED IN 250 WORDS)",0,0

Active treatment combinations reduced supine and erect blood pressure (F = 8.8, P = 0.0006, analysis of variance). In total, the onset of the drop in blood pressure was within 2 hours, with a maximum reduction at 4-6 hours and persisting for at least 12 hours. However, the combination of ACE inhibitor and alpha-blocker elicited a significantly greater hypotensive action than the other combinations (P < 0.05, analysis of variance). There was a modest reflex tachycardia in the upright position in all treatments (P = 0.008). Cardiac autonomic reflexes or left ventricular echocardiographic indices were not affected by the drug combinations. The hemodynamic effect of the combination of enalapril plus prazosin, which separately causes little hypotensive effect in Africans, may reflect an important pharmacodynamic interaction between vascular alpha 1 receptors and angiotensin II. All combinations lower blood pressure and warrant further study in hypertensive Nigerians. However, the combination of enalapril plus prazosin caused the greatest drop in blood pressure and caution is advised during concomitant use due to the greater hypotension of the first dose.",0,0

Effect of intervention with captopril.,,"SÃ¸gaard, P; GÃ¸tzsche, C O; Ravkilde, J; NÃ¸rgaard, A; Thygesen, K","Ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) are independent predictors of mortality in myocardial infarction (MI) survivors, and are more likely to be induced in dilated hearts with increased wall stress. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to prevent progressive dilation of the left ventricle after myocardial infarction; The effects of captopril were evaluated in 58 patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after myocardial infarction. Patients were randomized on day 7 to receive either placebo or captopril (50 mg daily) in a double-blind, parallel study over a 6-month period. The patients were followed by ambulatory ECG monitoring and echocardiography. There was a significant increase in VA in the placebo group (P < 0.05) in contrast to a significant decrease in the captopril group (P < 0.05). As a consequence, there was a significant difference between the groups after 6 months (P < 0.05). In addition, the number of patients without VA at the beginning of the study who presented it at the end of the study was 6% in the captopril group compared to 38% in the placebo group (p < 0.05). At baseline and at the end of the study, LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) and LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) were significantly increased among VA patients (p < 0.01). At day 180, both myocardial ischemia and increased LVEDVI were independent predictors of VA; however, progressive left ventricular dilatation was limited to patients receiving placebo with significant increases in LVEDVI compared to the captopril group: 17% versus 0%, respectively (p < 0.01). In addition, the duration of ambulatory ST-segment depression was significantly longer in this group compared to the captopril group (p < 0.01); Left ventricular dilatation and myocardial ischemia predict VA during the acute and chronic phases after MI. In post-MI patients with LV dysfunction, captopril has a beneficial effect on both the number of complex VAs and the number of patients who develop VAs during the chronic phase. This is most likely mediated by effects on LV remodeling, LV function, and myocardial ischemia in patients who are at increased risk of progressive left ventricular dilatation.",0,0

Converting enzyme inhibitors are widely used in patients with myocardial infarction, but their influence on cardiac period variability remains to be defined; Time and frequency domain measures of cardiac period variability were calculated from 24-hour Holter monitoring in 40 patients with a first uncomplicated myocardial infarction. After the initial examination between 48 and 72 hours after the onset of symptoms, patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or captopril, and 24-hour Holter monitoring was repeated on the third day. No changes were detected in the time and frequency domain after placebo. After captopril, the SD of all normal RR (NN) intervals (SDNN) increased from 90 +/- 29 to 105 +/- 30 milliseconds (P < 0.01); mean SD of NN intervals for all 5-minute segments (SDANN index) and mean SD of all NN intervals for all 5-minute segments (SDNN index) also increased from 74 +/- 24 to 90 +/- 26 milliseconds (p < 0.01) and from 45 +/- 17 to 49 +/- 15 milliseconds (p < 0.05), respectively. The successive root mean square difference (r-MSSD) and the percentage difference between adjacent NN intervals > 50 milliseconds (pNN50) remained unchanged. Regarding measures in the frequency domain, after captopril, total power (ln unit) increased from 8.28 +/- 0.42 to 8.47 +/- 0.30 (P < 0.01 ); Considering the frequency bands, a significant increase was observed in ULF (P < .01), VLF (P < .05), and low-frequency (LF) power (P < .05), while high-frequency power ( HF) remained unchanged.; This study supports the hypothesis that the renin-angiotensin system modulates the amplitude of ULF and VLF power. In addition, it shows that in patients with myocardial infarction, converting enzyme inhibition favorably modifies measures of cardiac period variability strongly associated with poor prognosis.",0,0

Recently, single low doses (1 mg) but not high doses (25 mg) of captopril have been suggested to increase furosemide-induced diuresis. It is not known whether the interaction between diuretics and ACE inhibitors is altered during long-term dosing; Eight patients with heart failure treated with diuretics and ACE inhibitors for at least 3 months were studied. All patients received captopril 12.5 mg three times a day for 2 weeks before the study. Sodium intake was set before the study and usual medication was discontinued on study days. Intravenous furosemide was administered on each of the 2 study days to maintain moderate and constant diuresis. Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were determined using elimination techniques, and urine was collected every hour for 4 hours. Captopril 12.5 mg or placebo was administered in a randomized, single-blind fashion at the end of the first hour.

Chest X-rays showed bilateral infiltrates in all cases. Pulmonary function was measured in five patients; four had airflow obstruction and two had mild restriction. Blood gas tests demonstrated hypoxemia in seven patients (58 +/- 3 mmHg). Seven patients had blood eosinophilia (1.76 +/- 0.2 x 10(9)/L). Bronchoalveolar lavage (performed in seven patients) showed a higher proportion of eosinophils (0.30 +/- 0.07). The Cd4+/CD8+ ratio was determined in four cases and was low in three. Transbronchial lung biopsy, performed in two patients, showed interstitial pneumonitis in both patients, with infiltration marked by eosinophils in one patient. The evolution was favorable in all patients. Due to severe symptoms, steroid therapy was required in three patients. Re-exposure was not attempted. We conclude that minocycline can induce pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophilia syndrome, that presenting symptoms can be severe and culminate in transient respiratory failure, and that the disease has a favorable prognosis.",0,0

Assessments included patient symptoms, health perceptions, levels of emotional, cognitive, social, and sexual functioning, as well as potential covariates such as life events and social support. The purpose of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of quality of life measures in SAVE at baseline and to provide a pre-randomization profile of SAVE patients. One hundred eighty-four patients participated in this aspect of the trial. Reliability alpha coefficients were adequate or better for all questionnaires, except for life events and sexual activities. Consistent with previous studies, quality of life parameters did not correlate with ventricular ejection fraction. Despite experiencing a recent myocardial infarction with compromised ventricular function, patients at baseline generally did not appear depressed or focused on symptoms. Initial results support the inclusion of the QoL companion study in the SAVE umbrella trial because of the independent contribution it is likely to make in terms of assessing both disease progression and treatment efficacy.",1,0

The role and use of ACE inhibitors in patients with chronic systolic ventricular dysfunction, established in earlier trials, has been further clarified. Increasing attention is being paid to ACE inhibitors, specifically the mechanisms by which they improve mortality, their side effects, and the possibility of further increasing their use by avoiding renal dysfunction and first-dose hypotension. Although most interest has focused on ACE inhibitors, the importance of diuretics and their use in combination with ACE inhibitors is becoming clearer. The most important thing has been the demonstration over the last year of the efficacy of digoxin in preventing cardiac deterioration in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and sinus rhythm. Greater understanding of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, its modification by ACE inhibitors, and the interaction of ACE inhibition with other drugs provides the basis for further improvement in morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure.",0,0

Long-term follow-up.,,"Torregrosa, J V; Campistol, J M; Montesinos, M; Rogada, A G; Oppenheimer, F; Andreu, J","Post-transplant erythrocytosis (PTE) represents a frequent complication in allograft recipients with normal renal function. Although the pathogenesis is not completely known, an alteration in the regulation of erythropoietin production by native kidneys or by renal allograft has been implicated as the main causes. Traditional therapies include repeat phlebotomies, bilateral native nephrectomies, and anticoagulant therapy. Recently, theophylline has been proposed as an effective therapy, although without general acceptance. In addition, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been implicated in the development of anemia in patients with chronic renal failure and dialysis. The objective of the present study was to demonstrate the efficacy of captopril in the long-term treatment of PE. Nineteen renal allograft recipients affected with severe PE were included in the study. All patients had their native kidneys and none had a renal tumor or hydronephrosis. Restrictive PE criteria were applied to all patients and other causes of erythrocytosis were rationally excluded. Captopril was administered at a dose of 25 mg/24 h (12.5 mg bid) for 12 months and the initial dose was not changed during follow-up. After 3 months of captopril treatment and during the study period, significant reductions in hematocrit (P < 0.001), hemoglobin (P < 0.001), and red blood cell count (P < 0.001) were obtained in all patients. . Erythropoietin levels decreased significantly during the study period, although the values were within the normal range of our laboratory. Captopril was well tolerated and only 1 patient had to be withdrawn from the drug due to dry cough. This study has shown that captopril, at low doses, represents a safe and effective therapy for PTE, without notable side effects or graft dysfunction. Long-term treatment with captopril in PE did not induce anemia.",0,0

To determine whether continuation of ACE inhibitor therapy until the morning of surgery leads to an unacceptable decrease in blood pressure on induction, we investigated 51 vascular surgical patients who received chronic treatment for hypertension with captopril or enalapril; After randomization, ACE inhibitor therapy was continued until the morning of surgery or stopped at the time of the preanesthetic visit, at least 12 hours (captopril) or 24 hours (enalapril) before surgery. Each patient received a standardized anesthetic induction. If systolic blood pressure (monitored by radial artery cannula) fell below 90 mmHg in response to induction, ephedrine was given; A marked decrease in plasma converting enzyme activity was found in patients who received enalapril until the morning of the surgical procedure, and 100% of them required ephedrine after induction. In patients who received their usual dose of captopril on the morning of surgery, plasma converting enzyme activity was reduced to a lesser extent (compared to patients who received enalapril). Finally, in patients in whom ACE inhibitors, either enalapril or captopril, were discontinued the night before surgery, the incidence of induction-induced hypotension was significantly lower when enalapril or captopril was discontinued; These data indicate that in hypertensive patients chronically treated with ACE inhibitors, maintenance of therapy until the day of surgery may increase the likelihood of hypotension on induction.",0,0

It was carried out in four hospitals in the UK and six in Poland in consecutive phases: oral captopril was compared with oral mononitrate versus placebo among 400 patients in a 'three-way' study; and then oral captopril versus placebo and oral mononitrate versus placebo were compared between 474 patients in '2 x 2' and '2 x 2 x 2' factorial studies (with 208 patients in the latter study also randomized between intravenous magnesium and open control). The factorial studies differed from the three-way study in that one group of patients was assigned oral captopril and oral mononitrate, a higher maintenance dose of captopril (after the same starting dose) was used, and slow-release mononitrate was used. checked once a day. . In the three-way study, the mean lowest systolic blood pressures recorded during the first 4 hours after randomization were (mmHg +/- standard error): 104 +/- 2 captopril vs 105 +/- 1 mononitrate vs 112 +/- 2 placebo (P < 0.001 for captopril or mononitrate vs placebo), and in factorial studies it was 105 +/- 1 captopril vs 110 +/- 1 placebo (P < 0.01) and 106 +/- - 1 mononitrate vs. 108 +/- 1 placebo (NS). There was excess hypotension among patients assigned to active treatment (captopril > mononitrate > placebo) and there was a small but significant excess of cardiogenic shock with captopril compared to control in the factorial study. However, in these studies, neither captopril nor mononitrate was associated with any overall increase in the incidence of hypotension considered severe enough to cause treatment discontinuation. No other serious complications were observed and compliance with study tablets at hospital discharge was not significantly different between the active and placebo groups. Patients assigned to magnesium in the 2 x 2 x 2 factorial study had slightly lower mean systolic blood pressure just after the initial 15-min bolus injection (126 +/- 2 magnesium vs. 134 +/- 3 mg). control, P < 0.05), but there were no significant differences during the subsequent 24-h maintenance infusion period.

This report reviews the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of this condition, with particular attention to concomitant risk factors and adherence issues; A literature search was performed using MEDLINE files dating back to 1986. The keywords were ""hypertension"", ""antihypertensive agents"", ""patient compliance"", ""cardiovascular risk factors"", ""isolated systolic hypertension"" and ""JNC"". Additional references were accessed by crossing the bibliographies of the articles obtained in this search.; Effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic management of hypertension, including stage 1 according to the Fifth Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC-V) reclassification, can greatly reduce patient mortality. Despite extensive national efforts, 35 percent of hypertensive patients remain unknown and only 7 percent have their hypertension adequately controlled. Any additional cardiovascular risk factors increase the risk of an adverse outcome and may be negatively affected by treatment. The JNC-V recommendations regarding equally effective pharmacological agents are flexible but controversial. The favorable cardioprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers, and alpha-beta blockers often make them a more suitable choice than diuretics or beta-blockers. Practical techniques to improve patient adherence to treatment regimens are also important and should begin when the diagnosis of hypertension is made.",0,0

Antihypertensive therapy can interfere with these diseases and their therapies. In the present study, the possible interactions of the ACE inhibitor perindopril with several of the most frequent chronic diseases were evaluated; In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the effect of perindopril was evaluated in 490 patients with mild essential hypertension and any of the following concomitant diseases: hyperlipidemia, type II diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, occlusive disease peripheral arterial disease, kidney disease with proteinuria, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or degenerative joint disease treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Following a 3-week single-blind placebo trial, patients received perindopril (4 mg/day) or matching placebo for 6 weeks; Perindopril effectively lowered blood pressure regardless of associated disease. The rate of spontaneously reported side effects was low. Perindopril treatment was free of adverse interactions with concomitant diseases and therapies. In addition, favorable actions could be observed in patients with ischemic heart disease (reduction of maximum ST-segment depression during maximal exercise and decrease in the number of angina attacks), in patients with proteinuria (decrease in albuminuria in patients with normal levels of serum creatinine), and in patients treated with NSAIDs (increased concentration of prostaglandin E2 in the gastric mucosa suggesting gastric cytoprotection); This trial shows that ACE inhibition with perindopril represents a simple, safe and effective short-term therapeutic option for the large proportion of patients with mild essential hypertension and concomitant diseases and treatments.",0,0

LogeSDi was estimated to be 0.420 and its 90% probability range (0.353-0.490) was calculated using the bootstrap method; The high within-person variation for AER means that only people with a baseline AER in the range of 53-76 micrograms/min have a high probability (P > or = 0.95) of being classified as microalbuminuric (20-200 micrograms/min). micrograms/min) in a subsequent sample. However, subjects with a baseline AER > or = 53 or > or = 80 micrograms/min have a 95% and 99% chance of persistent microalbuminuria.

The first 11 patients received no drug, the next 20 patients received a single oral dose of captopril (1 mg/kg), and the last 22 patients received a renin inhibitor infusion (remikiren; 1 mg/kg over 60 min); The maximum drop in diastolic blood pressure was comparable in the two treated groups. Changes in diastolic blood pressure analyzed as area under the curve were similar for both drugs (overall F1,40 = 1.26, P = 0.27). Although baseline renin levels were within the narrow range of 5 to 80 pg/mL, the drop in diastolic blood pressure analyzed as area under the curve from time 32 min to time 60 min was significantly correlated with renin level. active at baseline in both groups (remikiren r = 0.44, P < 0.05; captopril r = 0.47, P < 0.05). Plasma active renin levels increased significantly at 30, 90, and 120 min in both groups, and peak active renin levels were significantly correlated with baseline active renin level (remikiren r = 0.62, P < 0, 01, captopril r = 0.66, P < 0.01). Plasma prorenin levels did not change; This study suggests that acute renin inhibition and acute angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition similarly lower blood pressure and increase plasma active renin levels. Acute blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in its initial step by a renin inhibitor can therefore be used to investigate the renin dependence of blood pressure in essential hypertension.",0,0
1638,8064788,"Clinical pharmacology of converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics.",,"Sinaiko, A R","The prevailing trend in pediatric antihypertensive therapy is increasing reliance on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers due to their overall efficacy, low incidence of adverse reactions, and potential specific benefit in patients with renal disease. The common etiologic relationship between kidney disease and elevated BP is also the reason why diuretic therapy continues to be included in many treatment regimens. There are several ACE inhibitors available for clinical use, although only captopril has undergone a significant degree of investigation in children. Initial doses of captopril are 0.5 mg/kg in children > 6 months of age and 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg in neonates, due to an apparently increased antihypertensive effect and duration of action in this age group. Side effects are few and the main adverse effect is a reduction in glomerular filtration in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis. Calcium channel blockers reduce cytosolic calcium concentration and are particularly effective in patients with volume-dependent forms of hypertension. The pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs are similar to those of drug elimination by hepatic metabolism. In particular, nifedipine has a rapid onset of action and is widely used to treat hypertensive emergencies. Although it has been used sublingually, the efficacy of the drug is due to absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Few side effects of these medications have been reported in children. Heart rate and cardiac output increase but return to pre-treatment levels within a few weeks. As with ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers appear to have a positive effect on kidney function.",0,0

The aim of this study was to determine whether long-term treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation in forearm resistance vessels of patients with hypertension. Furthermore, since tissue thiols may be relevant to nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation, we question whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with a sulfhydryl group preferentially increases endothelium-dependent vasodilation in these individuals. The study included 24 patients with essential hypertension (mean age, 45 +/- 2 years) and 20 normotensive subjects (mean age, 47 +/- 1 years). Methacholine chloride (0.3 to 10 micrograms/min) was infused via the brachial artery to assess endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the resistance vessels of the forearm. Nitroglycerin (1 to 30 micrograms/min) was administered to assess endothelium-independent vasodilation. Forearm blood flow was determined by venous occlusion strain gauge plethysmography.

The patients were followed up for 12 months. Most of the patients treated with lisinopril had hypertension, but a small number (180) had heart failure. Most of the patients who received nifedipine had uncomplicated hypertension, but some (22.57%) had other cardiovascular diseases with or without hypertension. Lisinopril and nifedipine were equally effective in lowering blood pressure. During the study, 1.5% of hypertensive patients assigned to lisinopril died compared to 1.8% of patients assigned to nifedipine, and 15.1% of patients assigned to lisinopril compared to 19. 7% of patients in the nifedipine group withdrew due to adverse events. Cough, malaise and fatigue, nausea and vomiting were more common causes of withdrawal from lisinopril than from nifedipine. In contrast, headaches, paleness and flushing, edema, and palpitations led to more frequent nifedipine withdrawals. Anemia was more common with nifedipine treatment than with lisinopril. In hypertensive patients, the frequency of hypotension in the first dose was similar in both treatments. Serious events occurred in 0.8% and 0.5% of patients receiving lisinopril and nifedipine, respectively. Lisinopril was well tolerated by heart failure patients: 16 patients (8.88%) died and a 4.44% incidence of serious adverse events was reported, a pattern that would be expected in such patients; dizziness, vertigo, dyspnea, cough, nausea and vomiting were the most frequent causes of withdrawal; the incidence of hypotension in the first dose was low (2.22%).

In the acute phase, captopril can scavenge free radicals, attenuate the catecholamine response, cause coronary vasodilation, and increase prostacyclin and bradykinin levels. In the chronic phase, remodeling may be attenuated. Currently, a large number of controlled clinical trials are being carried out, mainly focused on the effects of ACE inhibition in the chronic phase. Only a few studies focus on the effect of acute intervention with ACE inhibitors on ischemia-reperfusion, that is, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction. In the pilot study of captopril and thrombolysis (CAT pilot study) captopril 3 mg and 6.25 mg were well tolerated as adjunctive therapy to intravenous streptokinase. The decrease in mean arterial pressure (36 +/- 11%) after 6.25 mg was comparable to that of the control group (30 +/- 7%). In addition, norepinephrine levels decreased as a function of dose to 47 +/- 6 and 38 +/- 7% from baseline, respectively. These results prompted a large nationwide acute intervention trial of captopril in 300 patients receiving thrombolytic therapy: the Captopril and Thrombolysis Study (CATS). The leading CATS hypothesis assumes a very early effect of converting enzyme inhibition on evolving myocardial damage due to ischemia and early reperfusion consequences. This will be assessed by serial echocardiography, Holter monitoring, and neurohumoral measurements immediately after thrombolysis and for the first year after myocardial infarction. Blinded data show a favorable blood pressure response, with systolic hypotension below 100 mm Hg occurring in only 0.2% of patients.",0,0

Rationale and design of the German multicenter study on the effects of captopril on cardiopulmonary exercise parameters after myocardial infarction (ECCE).,,"Kleber, F X; Reindl, I; Wenzel, M; Rodewyk, P; Beil, S; Kosloswki, B; Doering, W; Sabin, G V; Hinzmann, S; Winter, U J","Left ventricular damage from myocardial tissue necrosis can compromise left ventricular function, increase left ventricular volume, and ultimately develop heart failure. This sequence in pathophysiology has been shown to be attenuated by ACE inhibitors. However, volume augmentation may also be helpful in restoring stroke volume and improving elevation of filling pressures. Furthermore, very early institution of ACE inhibition failed to improve short-term mortality after myocardial infarction in a large trial. Therefore, the aim of the ECCE trial is to investigate the early effects of the ACE inhibitor captopril on compromised exercise capacity, which is believed to be an early measurable sign of the development of heart failure. The ECCE trial is a seven-center randomized investigation studying the effects of ACE inhibition on oxygen consumption in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design in a group of 204 patients. The sample size was calculated based on a pilot test. The study design and the first unblinded data from 104 patients are presented. The population is predominantly made up of male patients with mostly first myocardial infarction. They were admitted to the hospital within five hours of the onset of chest pain. End-diastolic volumes were normal, but ejection fraction was moderately compromised. ACE inhibition was started after the first day, but within 72 hours after the onset of chest pain. After four and twelve weeks, oxygen consumption was considerably below expected values and one-third of the patients had severely compromised exercise capacity. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED IN 250 WORDS)",1,1
1667,8125423,The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study: justification and perspective.,,"Pfeffer, M A","Myocardial infarction increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events (eg, heart failure or other myocardial infarction) among survivors compared with the general population. Left ventricular dysfunction is among the main risk factors for such adverse events. Although reductions in cardiovascular risk have been achieved through the use of aspirin, beta-blockers (and sometimes revascularization and/or serum lipid-lowering agents), the potential for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to improve outcome of myocardial infarction survivors has only recently been examined. The concept that ACE inhibition might be beneficial for these patients originated from animal studies that demonstrated that long-term ACE inhibition therapy attenuated left ventricular enlargement. Following clinical confirmation of this initial finding, the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial was designed to determine whether long-term ACE inhibition therapy would reduce morbidity and mortality among survivors of myocardial infarction. The SAVE study found the following risk reductions among recipients of captopril versus placebo: death (all causes) 19% (95% confidence interval, 3 to 35%; P = .019); cardiovascular death 21% (95% confidence interval, 5 to 35%; P = .014); myocardial infarction 25% (95% confidence interval, 5 to 40%; P = .012). To the list of proven therapies that prolong survival after myocardial infarction, the physician can now add ACE inhibition with captopril for patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Survivors of a myocardial infarction are at increased risk of subsequent adverse cardiovascular events. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED IN 250 WORDS)",1,1

The clinical picture is essentially nonspecific, with a highly variable latency period from days to years. Drug hepatotoxicity can mimic almost any type of liver disease. A complete drug history, a low threshold of suspicion, and the exclusion of other causes of liver disease are important for the detection of drug-induced liver disorders. Treatment consists of discontinuation of suspected drugs, acetylcysteine in the course of paracetamol (acetaminophen) toxicity, and liver transplantation in selected cases of fulminant hepatic failure. Guidelines regarding the use of select medications such as methotrexate and halothane should be followed. Potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be used with caution in alcoholic patients with or without liver compromise. Patients with uncompensated liver disease should receive a reduced dose of medication adjusted to the degree of liver function impairment.

Ramipril is a prodrug that undergoes de-esterification in the liver to form ramiprilat, its active metabolite. Ramipril is rapidly distributed to all tissues, with the liver, kidneys, and lungs showing markedly higher concentrations of the drug than in the blood. After absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, rapid hydrolysis of ramipril occurs in the liver. In the therapeutic concentration range, protein binding of ramipril and ramiprilat is 73 and 56%, respectively. Ramiprilat binds to ACE with high affinity at concentrations similar to that of the enzyme and slowly establishes equilibrium. Although ramipril is metabolized by hepatic and renal mechanisms to both a glucuronate conjugate and a diketopiperazine derivative, most of the drug is excreted in the urine as ramiprilat and the ramiprilat glucuronate conjugate. Elimination from the body is characterized by a relatively rapid initial phase with a half-life of 7 hours and a late phase with a half-life of about 120 hours. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions between ramipril and other drugs have been reported. The drug has been generally well tolerated, with the most frequent adverse effects being dizziness (3.4%), headache (3.2%), weakness (1.9%) and nausea (1.7%).

In the present clinical trial, plasma bradykinin levels were followed during the early phase of dialysis in 10 patients, who were not being treated with ACE inhibitors, using AN69, cuprophane and polysulfone membranes. Bradykinin was measured after extraction by radioimmunoassay. During this study, an episode of anaphylaxis occurred during dialysis with the AN69 membrane. Blood samples were collected during the first 5 min of the adverse reaction and showed a greater than 100-fold increase in AN69 dialyzer venous effluent (baseline 40 +/- 3 vs. 4,900 +/- 130 fmol/ml after treatment). of 5 min). Although none of the patients received ACE inhibitors, there were 4 more asymptomatic individuals who showed a more than two-fold increase in their plasma bradykinin concentrations in the venous effluent from the AN69 dialyzer. When these patients were treated with cuprophane or polysulfone dialyzers, there was no significant bradykinin formation and no adverse events. Taken together, these findings show that anaphylactoid reactions with AN69 membrane are due to excessive bradykinin generation that can even occur in the absence of ACE inhibitors.",0,0

Cases of symptomatic hypotension have been reported occasionally, especially on the first day of treatment. The database we analyzed consisted of 1177 patients, with a mean age of approximately 70 years, with NYHA functional class II or III congestive heart failure. These patients were treated and observed prospectively according to a uniform protocol, beginning therapy with 2.5 mg enalapril and measuring blood pressure at hourly intervals for eight hours thereafter. Symptomatic hypotension was not experienced by 94.6% of patients, moderate symptoms (eg, dizziness, headache) by 4.75%, and severe symptoms (eg, fainting, collapse, renal failure) by 0.59%. For risk factor analyses, a large number of baseline variables were analyzed univariate to select those significant for inclusion in a multivariate stepwise logistic regression. Alternatively, the CART (Classification and Regression Tree) technique was used. Both techniques showed that diastolic blood pressure < or = 70 mmHg was the most significant risk factor. CART analyzes also showed that nitrate pretreatment and systolic blood pressure < or = 120 mmHg have prognostic relevance. Therefore, CART is a valuable complement when looking for prognostic factors.",0,0

Patients were seen in the clinic every 2 weeks, where their sitting and standing blood pressure and heart rate measurements were taken 24 +/- 2 hours after drug administration. Complete blood counts with differential cell counts, blood chemistry studies, urinalysis, and electrocardiograms were performed at baseline and during the study. Radiographs were taken once at baseline; Compared with placebo, all drug regimens reduced sitting and standing blood pressure (p < 0.001) and had no effect on sitting and standing heart rate. The greatest effect was obtained with the combinations of L/H12.5 and L/H25. There was no difference between L/H12.5 and L/H25 or between H12.5 and H25. There were no serious clinical side effects except cough, which was slightly higher with L, L/H12.5, and L/H25. The only metabolic side effects were serum potassium level, which was lower with H25 (P < 0.01), and serum glucose level, which was higher with H25 and L/H25 (P < 0.01); The data suggest that (1) hypertension monotherapy with L, H12.5, H25, L/H12.5, and L/H25 was effective and well tolerated; (2) the best results were achieved with L/H12.5 and L/H25; (3) lower doses of hydrochlorothiazide alone or in combination with lisinopril were equivalent to higher doses and had no metabolic side effects.",0,0

Since endothelin may contribute to hemodynamic deterioration through potent vasoconstrictor and cardiotoxic actions, elevated plasma levels may be associated with poor prognosis after myocardial infarction; We test the hypothesis that plasma endothelin measurement in the subacute phase of myocardial infarction is related to subsequent survival and assess whether plasma endothelin measurements provide additional prognostic information to that obtained from clinical and biochemical variables previously known to be associated with high mortality. Plasma endothelin determination was obtained from 142 patients (mean age +/- SD, 67.8 +/- 10.1 years) on day 3 after documented myocardial infarction and was associated with 1-year mortality. Sixteen patients died during the follow-up period. In a univariate Cox proportional hazards model, day 3 plasma endothelin concentrations were significantly associated with mortality (p < 0.0001). Patient age, prior treatment for systemic hypertension, the presence of clinical heart failure, and plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels were associated with mortality on univariate analysis but did not provide additional prognostic information beyond that obtained from . the determination of endothelin in a multivariate model; Plasma endothelin concentrations are strongly related to outcome after myocardial infarction and provide prognostic information independent of clinical and biochemical variables previously associated with poor prognosis.",0,0

After a four-week run-in phase, a six-week intervention trial was conducted in which four matched groups of 14 patients, taking either captopril or enalapril, were assigned to one of four dietary treatments: low-sodium ( 80 mmol/day) with fish oil (5 g of omega-3 fatty acids per day); normal sodium (150 mmol/day) with fish oil; low sodium with olive oil; normal sodium with olive oil. All subjects adopted a low-sodium diet and adjustments in nutrient intake were made by double-blind administration of sodium and oils in supplemental tablets and capsules. BP fell in all treatment groups during the intervention. However, the reduction in SBP was 4.2 mmHg greater in subjects with low sodium intake than in those taking normal sodium. There was no difference in BP between those taking olive oil and those taking fish oil, but plasma triglycerides and serum thromboxane production were reduced by 27% and 51%, respectively, in the latter. Therefore, the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors may be increased by sodium restriction alone, but supplementing the diet with fish oil may produce additional cardiovascular benefits.",0,0

Left ventricular mass decreased significantly from 205 to 195 g at 8 weeks and to 202 g at 24 weeks, returning to 232 g 4 weeks after treatment. The thickness of the interventricular septum was significantly reduced at 24 weeks. Doppler parameters were not altered. Baseline 8-h ambulatory blood pressure did not change with treatment. The reduction in peak systolic blood pressure during exercise in the captopril group was not different from the change in the placebo group; Blood pressure can be effectively lowered using captopril in young subjects with borderline hypertension. Treatment is well tolerated and leads to regression of left ventricular wall thickness and mass, suggesting that treatment of blood pressure elevations may be advisable at lower levels than currently recommended.",0,0

The exact mechanism of this effect is uncertain. Signal-averaged electrocardiography has been used to assess the presence of late potentials as a marker of sudden cardiac death. We prospectively examined the effects of ACE inhibitor therapy on signal-averaged ECGs and ventricular arrhythmia rate in 20 patients with moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction and symptomatic congestive heart failure; A signal-averaged ECG and 24-hour Holter monitor were performed immediately before and 1 week and 6 weeks after the start of captopril treatment. The mean dose of captopril at 6 weeks was 38 +/- 31 mg. The patients (19 men and one woman, mean age 63 +/- 12 years) had a baseline ejection fraction of 22 +/- 7% and a mean functional class of 2.6 +/- 0.5. The cause of congestive heart failure was coronary artery disease in 18 patients, idiopathic cardiomyopathy in one, and valvular disease in one; All three signal-averaged ECG time-domain parameters tended to improve throughout the study (study 1, 2, 3: QRS duration (ms) = 108 +/- 11, 106 +/- 12, 105 +/- 11 Low Amplitude Signal Duration (ms) = 30 +/- 8, 31 +/- 10, 28 +/- 10 Root Mean Voltage (microV) = 33 +/- 20, 37 +/- 24, 40 + / - 2, respectively). These changes were not statistically significant, although the improvement in QRS duration was almost as significant at P = 0.06.

Two types are recognized, the Neumann type and the Hallopeau type, with their own characteristics; Three patients with pemphigus vegetans, two Hallopeau type and one Neumann type, were examined. Microscopic and immunofluorescence findings were recorded; Two notable features were present. In one case, pemphigus vegetans was possibly induced by the use of enalapril. Only in three previous cases has enalapril been described in relation to pemphigus. A second case was associated with a malignant lung tumor, a phenomenon that could not be traced in the literature; Two types of pemphigus vegetans must be distinguished. Induction of pemphigus (also vegetans) is an accepted side effect of captopril. The effect of enalapril on pemphigus is still under debate. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a patient with pemphigus vegetans and a simultaneous internal malignancy has been described.",0,0

To assess whether ACE inhibitors and vasodilators have different effects on BP salt sensitivity in humans, we compared the effect of the ACE inhibitor cilazapril and the vasodilator dihydralazine on renal function curve in a simple crossover study. randomized prospective blind; Nine patients (1 f, 8 m, mean age 41 +/- 4 years) with mild to moderate primary hypertension received a low-salt (20 mmol/d) and high-salt (200 mmol/d) diet. Medications were randomly administered low salt + cilazapril, high salt + cilazapril; low salt+dihydralazine, high salt+dihydralazine; or in reverse order.; All antihypertensive interventions lowered BP, but mean post-treatment MAP was significantly (p < 0.02) lower with low-salt cilazapril (83.6 +/- 2.8 mmHg) than with all of the following: cilazapril with high salt intake (86.4 +/- 2.9 mmHg), dihydralazine with low intake (91.6 +/- 3.2 mmHg) and high salt intake (90.1 +/- 3.3 mmHg) . Probably as a result of sympathetic activation, mean daily heart rate was higher after dihydralazine at low (72.9 +/- 2.9 b/min) and high salt intake (72.4 +/- 2.8 b/min) than after cilazapril with any salt intake (68.7 +/- 3.1 and 62.7 +/- 3.2 b/min).; The results document that BP reduction after acute ACE inhibition is a function of salt intake, ie, with ACE inhibitor therapy, BP is ""salt sensitive."" In contrast, dihydralazine-type vasodilators have similar antihypertensive effects at low and high salt intake. To the extent that the short-term results of this study can be extrapolated to long-term effects, they suggest that intrarenal mechanisms, i.e. restoration of the pressure-natriuresis relationship, are involved in the long-term antihypertensive action of ACE inhibitors.",0,0

1698,8178391,Surgery and percutaneous angioplasty in the management of renovascular hypertension.,,"Libertino, J A; Beckmann, C F","Unfortunately, no randomized trials have compared ART for renovascular hypertension with medical or surgical treatment. PTRA appears to be a safe and relatively simple procedure with lower complication rates than surgery. The outcome of renal angioplasty depends on the type of stenosis. In all published series, cure rates for fibromuscular disease are significantly higher than for atherosclerotic disease, and ART appears to be the procedure of choice in the treatment of hypertension in patients with fibromuscular disease. The role of renal angioplasty in patients with renovascular hypertension due to atherosclerotic diseases is uncertain. Most of the large published series describing the success of angioplasty in patients with atherosclerotic lesions have been highly selective, mainly including patients with focal stenotic lesions. Despite this selectivity, the cure rate has been only 19%. In completely unselected patients, atherosclerotic lesions are associated with a very high rate of technical failure, possibly as high as 60%. From the available data, isolated focal stenotic lesions of the renal artery due to atherosclerotic disease can be treated with a reasonable success rate. The success rate in patients with bilateral disease, bony stenosis, or total occlusion of the renal arteries appears to be very limited.

Due to a longer half-life and greater stability, the N-terminal prohormone of ANF (N-terminal proANF) may be a better integrator of atrial peptide secretion than ANF itself. Following myocardial infarction, elevated ANF and other neurohormones have been associated with a poor prognosis. However, when left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and other important clinical variables are included in the multivariate analysis, the independent predictive value of these neurohormones is markedly reduced; To test the prognostic value of N-terminal proANF after myocardial infarction, its plasma concentration was measured a mean of 12 days after myocardial infarction in 246 patients in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) Study. N-terminal proANF was a much stronger predictor of survival than ANF itself. Furthermore, in the multivariate analysis of cardiovascular mortality and development of heart failure, N-terminal proANF, in contrast to ANF and other neurohormones, remained a strong and independent predictor when the model included age, gender, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes, use of thrombolysis, Killip class, infarct location, and LVEF; Measurement of N-terminal proANF supplementation currently uses clinical and objective assessments and provides an important independent predictor of prognosis with respect to cardiovascular mortality and the development of heart failure.",0,0

Early administration of enalapril significantly attenuated heart enlargement after myocardial infarction and probably improved hemodynamics during the acute phase of complicated infarction. Decreased ejection fraction during recovery indicates impaired systolic function. The decrease in infarct-related regional ejection fraction suggests that the impairment may be due to poor healing of the infarct scar.",0,0

Forty-one patients with a history of congestive heart failure and continuous use of diuretics for > or = 3 months discontinued all diuretic therapy and therapy with lisinopril 5 mg (target 20 mg)/day (n = 20) or placebo (n = 21) started the next day. A diuretic was restarted if new or worsening symptoms and signs of CHF developed. Twelve patients (29%) did not require reinitiation of diuretics at any time during follow-up, while 29 (71%) reinitiated diuretic therapy after a median of 15 days (range 2 to 42). Fourteen patients taking lisinopril and 15 taking placebo required diuretic drugs (p = NS). Initial daily furosemide dose of > 40 mg, left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 0.27, and history of systemic hypertension were independent predictors of early reinitiation of diuretics by Cox proportional hazards analysis. The probability of remaining free of diuretics after 6 weeks was 71% if none of these criteria were present. This trial demonstrates the feasibility of stopping diuretic drugs in selected patients with stable congestive heart failure and predicts that patients are likely to need to restart treatment. Withdrawal of diuretics may be warranted when the furosemide dose is < or = 40 mg/day, the left ventricular ejection fraction is > 0.27, and there is no history of systemic hypertension.",0,0

Indices of reduced left ventricular function during exercise are a predictor of later survival, although left ventricular ejection fraction is a poor predictor of physical endurance. We evaluated the effect of captopril on physical endurance in 48 men with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. On the seventh day after myocardial infarction, patients were randomized to receive captopril 50 mg daily or matching placebo. The patients were followed up by serial echocardiography and stress testing for a period of 180 days. Exercise capacity was significantly improved in the captopril group.

In particular, we wanted to analyze the interrelationships between peripheral plasma levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), vasopressin (AVP), and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and also between ACTH and cortisol, during prolonged medical stress; All hormones were measured within 6 hours after the onset of an acute myocardial infarction. The patients were randomly assigned to three different study groups according to a double-blind procedure.; Group 1 (10 patients) received placebo treatment, group 2 (13 patients) received a maintenance dose of captopril 25 mg three times daily, group 3 (11 patients) received enalapril 5 mg three times daily ; Peptide hormones were measured by radioimmunoassay and cortisol by ELISA. Reference ranges for all hormones were obtained from 40 or more voter registration volunteers; At the start of the study, the mean plasma AVP +/- SEM (27.9 +/- 4.6 pmol/L) was significantly (P < 0.001) elevated above the mean of the reference range (1.82 +/- 4.6 pmol/L). - 0.09 pmol/l), and 12 patients had values > 50 pmol/l.

During the 72 hour observation period there was a highly significant (P < 0.001) drop in plasma CRH, AVP and cortisol. In contrast, plasma ACTH increased, and the change over time in ACTH was significantly different from the fall in plasma CRH, AVP, or cortisol (P < 0.001 for each comparison). No significant differences were observed in plasma CRH, AVP, ACTH, or cortisol responses to placebo, captopril, or enalapril; Within 6 hours after myocardial infarction, mean plasma CRH, AVP, and cortisol values increased significantly above mean control values, while ACTH decreased most significantly. During the 3 days following acute myocardial infarction, plasma CRH, AVP, and cortisol decreased substantially, and this pattern was not influenced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In contrast, plasma ACTH showed a significant increase over time. This suggests that the usual relationships between CRH, AVP, and ACTH, and between ACTH and cortisol, are altered in hospitalized patients with myocardial infarction. Peak AVP levels observed in 12 patients exceeded 50 pmol/L, which may be high enough to interfere with tissue perfusion. It is postulated that AVP V1 receptor antagonists may have therapeutic application in limiting infarct size.",1,0

It is also less prone to rapid changes secondary to hemodynamic disturbances. To assess the prognostic significance of plasma ANF(1-98) levels in severe heart failure (NYHA IV), the peptide was measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma samples from patients randomized to additional treatment with enalapril (n = 78) or placebo (n = 61) (CONSENSUS study). In the placebo group there was a positive relationship between mortality after 6 months and the initial level of ANF(1-98). Due to reduced mortality, especially among patients with elevated ANF(1-98) levels, there was no such association in patients treated with enalapril. For both groups there was a positive relationship between the increase in ANF(1-98) after 6 weeks of treatment and mortality, while a decrease indicated a favorable prognosis. It is concluded that the magnitude and changes in plasma ANF(1-98) provide information on prognosis and therapeutic effects with respect to mortality in patients with severe heart failure.

The mechanism of these renal effects is still debated. Recent animal studies suggest that ACE-inhibitory actions unrelated to angiotensin (Ang) II, such as bradykinin accumulation, may play a role. We therefore investigated the effects of a specific intervention on the renin-angiotensin system with the Ang II receptor antagonist losartan and compared these effects with those obtained with ACE inhibition, as this comparison might resolve the question of whether the effects of ACE inhibition are or are not Ang II related. The effects of losartan and enalapril were studied in eleven non-diabetic patients with proteinuria and hypertension. The protocol consisted of seven periods, each lasting one month, in which patients received once daily placebo, losartan 50 mg, losartan 100 mg, placebo, enalapril 10 mg, enalapril 20 mg, and placebo. , respectively. At the end of each study period, proteinuria, blood pressure, and renal function were determined.

During each phase, doses were adjusted to achieve a pre-dose clinical supine systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or up to a predetermined maximum dose. In both the felodipine and combination phases, supine and standing pre-dose systolic and diastolic pressures were significantly reduced compared to the placebo phase (supine pressure decrease: -13/- 5 and -18/-7, respectively). Only pre-dose supine diastolic pressure was significantly reduced (-3 mmHg) compared to placebo in the enalapril phase. In combination, the effects of the two drugs on predose blood pressure were additive. There was a 40-60% increase in reported symptoms in the felodipine and combination phases compared to the placebo and enalapril phases.

1724,8208641,ACE inhibition versus calcium antagonism in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension: a multicenter study. Ireland-Netherlands Lisinopril-Nifedipine Study Group.,,"Hart, W; Clarke, R J","The efficacy of lisinopril 10-40 mg once daily was compared with that of nifedipine tablets 20-40 mg twice daily in a 16-week, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study in which 127 patients with mild to moderate hypertension participated. The groups randomized to lisinopril or nifedipine were not significantly different with respect to any demographic variables. An analysis of pooled data from all centers demonstrated a significantly greater fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) both lying down and standing with lisinopril than with nifedipine treatment (difference between treatments 7.70 +/- 3.34 mmHg ; P = 0.02 and 10.2 +/- 3.30 mmHg; P = 0.003 for SBP lying down and standing, respectively). However, this difference may be explained by slightly higher mean SBP in the lisinopril treatment groups compared to the nifedipine group at the end of the placebo run-in period. Both treatments reduced lying and standing diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to the same extent, and the response rates to the two treatments were the same. The effects of the two drugs on heart rate were indistinguishable from each other. There were six patients treated with lisinopril and 12 with nifedipine who withdrew during randomized treatment (p = 0.22). Nineteen percent of lisinopril patients reported an adverse event compared to 36% of nifedipine patients. The relative risk of an adverse event with lisinopril compared with nifedipine was 0.42 (confidence limits 1.027-0.172), a difference that approached statistical significance (P = 0.0573). Lisinopril produced a greater reduction in both lying down and standing SBP than nifedipine, and both were associated with equivalent reductions in DBP. Lisinopril may be better tolerated than nifedipine.",0,0

Sublingual captopril (25 mg), nifedipine (10 mg), and prazosin (2 mg) were prescribed to determine the efficacy and safety of each medication in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies during hemodialysis. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured continuously up to 120 minutes after dosing. Response rates were 83% for captopril, 90% for nifedipine, and 11% for prazosin. Significant hypotensive effects of both sublingual captopril and nifedipine occurred at 10 min and continued up to 120 min. Systolic blood pressure reduction occurred earlier with nifedipine than with captopril (10 vs. 15 min). No significant differences in heart rate were observed between them. There were no side effects in the captopril group, but flushing, tachycardia, and headache were observed in 4 patients in the nifedipine group. We conclude that sublingual captopril and nifedipine were effective, but captopril appeared to have fewer side effects than nifedipine and may be an excellent alternative to sublingual nifedipine in the urgent treatment of hypertensive emergencies on hemodialysis. Prazosin was not recommended due to its low response rate.",0,0
1727,8247909,The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors after acute myocardial infarction.,,"Mehra, I V; Wilson, M D","During and immediately after myocardial infarction (MI), many complex and interrelated processes manifest the body's attempt to minimize damage and compensate for lost cardiac function. Although these compensatory responses may provide some short-term restoration of function, their long-term consequences may actually increase morbidity and mortality. Several agents have established roles in the treatment of these patients, while others, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, remain to be fully investigated. The results of two trials investigating the role of ACE inhibition after myocardial infarction appear to provide sufficient data to warrant the use of these drugs in certain patient populations. These results are promising, but more research is needed to answer the key questions raised by these trials.",0,0

Twelve separate groups were studied: placebo, piretanide 3 mg, piretanide 6 mg, ramipril 2.5 mg, ramipril 5 mg, ramipril 10 mg, and their combinations, as single daily morning doses. Patients were randomized after a 2-week drug-free run-in period; treatment was given for 6 weeks. A dose response compared to placebo was found for both drugs; the combination was more effective than either drug alone. Piretanide 6 mg, combined with ramipril 5 mg, provided optimal blood pressure reduction. Self-reported adverse effects for both drugs and their combinations did not exceed those reported for placebo. A surface analysis suggested that piretanide primarily lowered systolic blood pressure, while ramipril was more effective in lowering diastolic blood pressure.

The drugs were administered at the same time of day following a randomized, double-blind protocol. Mean resting arterial pressure (+/- SE) was 135 +/- 3 mm Hg with placebo administration, 118 +/- 4 with captopril, 110 +/- 4 with nifedipine, and 115 +/- 5 with propranolol. and increased with exercise to 163 +/- 4, 146 +/- 3, 136 +/- 4, 136 +/- 4, respectively. Oxygen consumption at peak exercise and ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) was 25.2 +/- 1.1 and 18.1 +/- 1.0 mL/min/kg with placebo. Only propranolol (-2.3 mL/min/kg) decreased maximal oxygen consumption during exercise. VAT oxygen consumption was reduced by nifedipine and propranolol, but was not affected by captopril. The effects on exercise capacity of blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients depend on the drug used and are not related to the amount of blood pressure reduction. The lower VAT oxygen consumption observed with nifedipine and propranolol, and not captopril, could be due to an excessive downward shift in the muscle perfusion pressure-oxygen consumption relationship that could occur during exercise.",0,0

Measurements at the end of the four phases included 24-hour blood pressure with Accutracker, laboratory hemodynamics with Dinamap and impedance cardiography, baroreflex sensitivity with pneumatic neck chamber, and plasma samples for neurohumoral and metabolic activity; Thirteen patients aged 55 years or older (mean +/- SEM 65 +/- 1 years) with mild to moderate hypertension completed the study; Primary data for analysis in the four phases of the study included ambulatory blood pressure values, laboratory hemodynamics, and baroreflex sensitivity.; Compared with previous placebo, lisinopril and nifedipine significantly reduced 24-hour blood pressure. In the laboratory, the effects of both compounds on blood pressure, cardiac output, calculated total systemic resistance, and the ratio of stroke volume to pulse pressure, an index of arterial compliance, were similar. Lisinopril was associated with a relative increase in standing systolic blood pressure compared to nifedipine (P < 0.05). This was consistent with an improved heart rate response (RR interval) to neck pressure, which also decreased carotid transmural pressure, with lisinopril versus nifedipine (P < 0.05); Lisinopril and nifedipine were effective as monotherapy in controlling blood pressure in these elderly patients. Despite similar effects on blood pressure and systemic hemodynamics, baroreflex sensitivity in response to a reduction in carotid transmural pressure was greater with lisinopril than with nifedipine.",0,0

The results of previous studies contradict the association of several characteristics of postlithic lesions that could predict reocclusion.; Therefore, a computer-aided algorithm was used to quantitatively measure edge roughness in the 90-minute post-lysis angiogram of 84 patients who received recombinant tissue plasminogen activator within 6 hours of chest pain. Twenty-five patients had reocclusion and 59 did not. The baseline angiogram showed no differences between these two groups in terms of minimum dimensions or relative percentage of stenosis. Length was greater in the reocclusion group (12.2 +/- 5.0 vs. 10.0 +/- 4.2 mm, P < 0.05). Three of the four roughness indices based on curvature analysis indicated greater roughness in those patients with reocclusion.

1742,8280816,Review article: drug-induced hepatotoxicity.,,"Lee, W M","The liver is essential for the metabolic disposition of virtually all drugs and xenobiotics (foreign substances). For the most part, this process takes place without damaging the liver or other organs. Some compounds such as acetaminophen, CCl4, and the toxin responsible for mushroom poisoning are either toxic themselves or produce metabolites that cause liver damage in a uniform and dose-dependent manner. However, most agents form a sufficiently toxic byproduct and cause liver damage very rarely, under special circumstances. Generation of a toxic metabolite within the hepatocyte can cause direct cell injury with disruption of intracellular function, or it can cause indirect injury through immune-mediated membrane damage. Factors that promote toxin accumulation include genetic variants of enzymes that allow increased formation of the harmful metabolite, induction of an isoenzyme species that produces more than the usual amount of toxin, interference with regular (nontoxic) metabolic pathways ) by the competition of substrates by the enzyme , or depletion of the required detoxifying substrates. The following review will provide clinical examples of some of these well-known metabolic reactions, discuss some new topics in drug-induced hepatotoxicity, such as the use of combination agents and complex multi-drug regimens, alternative health strategies (vitamins and herbs), as well as the widespread use of cocaine. The general message is that as new compounds are released, new opportunities for drug-induced hepatotoxicity arise. Until extensive experience with any new compound is developed, it is best to maintain a healthy paranoia about newer drugs: there are very few totally safe agents.",0,0

In an echocardiographic substudy of the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial, we evaluated whether captopril would attenuate progressive left ventricular enlargement in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction and, if so, whether this would be associated with better clinical result. ; Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiograms were obtained in 512 patients at a mean of 11.1 +/- 3.2 days after infarction and were repeated at 1 year in 420 survivors. Left ventricular size was assessed as left ventricular cavity areas at end-diastole and end-systole and left ventricular function as percent change in cavity area from end-diastole to end-systole. the systole Patients were randomly assigned to placebo or captopril, and the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events including cardiovascular death, heart failure requiring hospitalization or open-label angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, and recurrent heart attack was determined during a follow-up period with an average of 3.0 +/- 0.6 years. Regardless of treatment assignment, baseline left ventricular systolic area and percent change in area were strong predictors of cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular adverse events. At 1 year, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic areas were greater in the placebo group than in the captopril group (p = 0.038, p = 0.015, respectively), and the percentage change in left ventricular chamber area it was higher in the captopril group (p = 0.005). One hundred eleven of 420 1-year survivors with 1-year echo measurements (26.4%) experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event, and these patients had more than a threefold increase in left ventricular chamber areas than those with an uncomplicated course. Sixty-nine patients with adverse cardiovascular events were in the placebo group compared to 42 patients in the captopril-treated group (a 35% risk reduction, P = 0.010); Two-dimensional echocardiography provides important and independent prognostic information in patients after a heart attack. Left ventricular enlargement and function after infarction are associated with the development of adverse cardiac events. Attenuation of ventricular enlargement with captopril in these patients was associated with a reduction in adverse events. This study demonstrates the link between attenuation of left ventricular enlargement by captopril after infarction and better clinical outcome.",0,0

Role of angiotensin II in humans.,,"Fisher, N D; Allan, D; Kifor, I; Gaboury, C L; Williams, G H; Moore, T J; Hollenberg, N K","We compared renal vascular responses to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and renin inhibition to assess the influence of angiotensin II (Ang II). We examined renal and endocrine responses to the renin inhibitor enalkiren, captopril, and placebo in nine healthy and nine hypertensive men on a 10-mmol sodium diet. Ang II was infused to assess the effects of agents on renal and adrenal response to Ang II. Plasma Ang II concentration was similarly suppressed by enalkiren and captopril: an identical level of blockade was achieved. Although renal plasma flow was stable during placebo, a substantial increase was seen with both enalkiren (+133 +/- 26 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and captopril (+99.4 +/- 22.6 ). There was a striking within-subject agreement between renal plasma flow responses to renin-converting enzyme inhibition (r = 0.90, P < 0.004). The vasodilator response to both agents correlated inversely with the drop in renal plasma flow induced by Ang II alone (r = -0.66, P < 0.05). Both agents significantly improved renal vascular response to Ang II (p = 0.01) and, in addition, renal vasodilator response to captopril predicted potentiation of renal plasma flow response to Ang II after either agent (enalkiren: r = 0.91). , p < 0.001; captopril: r = 0.56, p < 0.05). Concordance of maximal renal plasma flow response to the two agents also appeared in hypertensive men. Our results indicate that the acute renal response to captopril largely reflects a reduction in Ang II formation. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED IN 250 WORDS)",0,0

1759,8300885,Angiotensin II receptor blockade: an innovative approach to cardiovascular pharmacotherapy.,,"Eberhardt, R T; Kevak, R M; Kang, P M; Frishman, W H","Through the multiple actions of angiotensin II (AII), the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) participates in cardiovascular homeostasis. Angiotensin II acts by binding to specific membrane-bound receptors, which are coupled to one of several signal transduction pathways. These AII receptors exhibit heterogeneity, represented by the AT1 and AT2 receptor subtypes. The AT1 receptor mediates the main cardiovascular action of the RAS. This receptor has been cloned from multiple species, revealing features consistent with a G protein-linked transmembrane receptor. Further heterogeneity of the AII receptor is evident by the cloning of AT1 receptor isotypes. Blocking the interaction of AII with its receptor is the most direct site of inhibiting the actions of the RAS. Many AII receptor antagonists, including peptide analogs of AII and antibodies directed against AII, have unfavorable properties that have limited their clinical utility. However, the discovery and further development of imidazole compounds with AII antagonistic properties and favorable characteristics hold promise for clinical utility. The leader in this field is a selective AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan (previously known as DuP 753 or MK-954). Losartan was shown to be an effective antagonist of many AII-induced actions and an effective antihypertensive agent in many animal models of hypertension (HTN). Losartan also demonstrated secondary benefits in preventing stroke, treating congestive heart failure (CHF), and slowing the progression of kidney disease in animal models. Clinical studies confirm the AII antagonist action of losartan and suggest that losartan will be effective in the treatment of essential hypertension. Antagonism of AII is likely to provide useful treatment in essential HTN and CHF, conditions in which the RAS is known to play an important role. The utility of AII antagonism may extend beyond HTN and CHF, as suggested by the potential utility of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in the treatment or prevention of many other diseases. The key advantage that AII antagonists provide over ACE inhibitors is that they can avoid undesirable side effects related to bradykinin potentiation with the latter drugs. AII antagonists will help determine the role of the RAS in physiological regulation and in the pathophysiology of various disease states.",0,0

One of these is through decreased kinin degradation, which leads to increased production of vasodilator metabolites of arachidonic acid. It was reasoned that if ACE inhibition also leads to increased production of the potent vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2, then maneuvers that selectively inhibit thromboxane production without reducing prostaglandin (PG) E2 + PGI2 might enhance the antihypertensive effect of ACE. ACE inhibition. Therefore, this randomized, double-blind, crossover study was conducted to determine: (1) whether captopril increases platelet and/or renal thromboxane production; and (2) whether low-dose aspirin increases the antihypertensive effect of captopril. Patients with mild essential hypertension and no other significant medical problems were studied. In a double-blind randomized order, patients took captopril alone (25 mg every 12 h) for 2 weeks and captopril plus aspirin (75 mg/day) for another 2 weeks. Active treatment periods were preceded by 2 weeks of single-blind placebo. Fifteen patients with a mean age of 53 years and a mean mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 114 +/- 8 (+/- SD) mm Hg were studied. Serum thromboxane B2 was higher (P < 0.05) during captopril/placebo treatment (600 +/- 46 (+/- SE) pg/mL) than during the two washout periods combined (420 +/- 57 and 553 +/- 78) and was lower (P < 0.0005) during captopril/aspirin treatment (302 +/- 36). Captopril treatment significantly increased urinary PGE2 excretion (P = 0.038). Captopril/placebo significantly reduced MAP (P < 0.05) to 105.0 +/- 3.7 mm Hg compared to the washout period. However, the addition of aspirin to captopril did not cause a further reduction in MAP (105.2 +/- 2.8 mm Hg). It was concluded that treatment with captopril increases platelet thromboxane production.

A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy in hypertension and angina pectoris.,,"Brogden, R N; McTavish, D","Nifedipine's 'Gastrointestinal Therapeutic System' (GITS) is a newly developed formulation that slowly releases the drug in the intestinal tract over a 24-hour period. When administered once daily, it is similar in efficacy to the sustained-release formulations of felodipine, verapamil, and diltiazem and at least as effective as the standard formulations of lisinopril and enalapril, and long-acting propranolol and atenolol in the treatment of patients. with mild to moderate disease. essential hypertension. Substitution of nifedipine GITS for conventional formulations of nifedipine, diltiazem, or verapamil maintained adequate control of anginal symptoms in patients with stable angina pectoris. Nifedipine GITS appears to maintain quality of life and is apparently better tolerated than those formulations of nifedipine requiring 2 or 3 times daily administration in both elderly and younger patients. In addition, it has minimal effect on lipid and glucose metabolism and reverses left ventricular hypertrophy, making it suitable for the treatment of most patients with mild to moderate hypertension or angina pectoris.",0,0

Experimental studies reported that captopril was able to reduce ET-1 secretion and that ET-1 increased during reperfusion. This study aimed to verify whether captopril was able to reduce plasma ET-1 during thrombolysis in AMI. Seventy-three patients, hospitalized for suspected AMI within 4 h from the onset of symptoms suitable for thrombolysis (1st episode), Killip class 1-2, were randomized (double-blind) into two groups: group 1 (37 pts ), 8 F/29 M, received captopril, 6.25 mg, orally 15 min before thrombolysis. Group 2: (36 pts) 8 F/28 M, received placebo before thrombolysis. All patients met the reperfusion criteria. Plasma ET-1 was controlled at admission, 1 h and 2 h after the start of thrombolysis. Group 1 contained 10 unstable anginas, 17 anterior and 10 inferior AMIs. Group 2 contained ten unstable anginas, 16 anterior and ten inferior AMIs. Mean concentrations of ET-1: Unstable angina: group 1, baseline--4.56, at 1 h--4.47, at 2 h--5.89 pg/ml; group 2: baseline--4.17, at 1 h--4.59, at 2 h--5.24 pg/ml.

Patients were randomized a mean of 11 days after infarction to receive captopril 25 mg three times daily, xamoterol 200 mg twice daily, or matching placebo. After 6 months of treatment, 6 patients in the placebo group (n = 24), 1 in the captopril group (n = 23), and 3 in the xamoterol group (n = 23) had been withdrawn from the study due to clinical complications. Left ventricular volume was measured by magnetic resonance imaging, before randomization and after 6 months of treatment. Changes in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume after 6 months of treatment were prospectively defined as primary endpoints. The mean baseline end-diastolic volume index was 85 (SD 19) mL/m2, the mean end-systolic volume index was 45 (SD 18) mL/m2, and the mean ejection fraction was 48 (SD 11)% for all the group. There were no significant changes in left ventricular volume index in the placebo or treatment group after 6 months of treatment. At 11 days, only minimal dilatation of the left ventricle was observed. There was no further increase in left ventricular volume after six months and no further benefit from treatment with captopril or xamoterol. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED IN 250 WORDS)",0,0
1773,8522630,Management of urgencies and hypertensive emergencies.,,"Abdelwahab, W; Frishman, W; Landau, A","Hypertensive emergency is a condition in which there is elevation of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure with the presence of acute target organ disease. Hypertensive urgency is a condition in which blood pressure is elevated (diastolic > 120 mmHg) in the absence of acute target organ disease. Hypertensive emergencies are best managed with parenteral medications and careful control of intra-arterial blood pressure. Hydralazine has been widely used in the treatment of hypertension in eclampsia and pre-eclampsia, and its safety in these patients has been demonstrated. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) has the most reliable antihypertensive activity, beginning immediately after its administration and ending when the infusion is stopped. As with diazoxide, it should be used with caution in patients with impaired cerebral blood flow. SNP is the drug of choice to obtain controlled hypotension in patients undergoing neurovascular surgery. Intravenous nitroglycerin is useful in patients prone to myocardial ischemia but should be avoided in patients with increased intracranial pressure. Esmolol is effective in controlling both supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and severe hypertension. Its short onset of action makes it useful in emergency situations, but because of its negative inotropic effect, its use should be avoided in patients with low cardiac output. Verapamil should not be used in patients with pre-existing conduction abnormalities. Nicardipine is a potent arteriolar vasodilator with no significant direct depressant effect on the myocardium. As with other afterload-reducing agents, it should not be used in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors generally cause cerebral vasodilation, enalaprilat may be particularly beneficial for patients who are at high risk of developing episodes of cerebral hypotension secondary to impaired cerebral circulation. Fenoldopam, a selective postsynaptic dopaminergic receptor (DA1), has been shown to be effective in the treatment of severe hypertension with a lower incidence of side effects than the SNP. Hypertensive emergencies can usually be managed with oral agents. Oral nifedipine, captopril, clonidine, labetalol, prazosin, and nimodipine have been shown to be effective in these situations.",0,0

This was defined as a constant elevation of systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mmHg; Enalaprilat 0.015 mg kg-1 was injected in 5 min in 9 patients; Central hemodynamics and systemic oxygenation were assessed initially before enalaprilat injection and repeatedly for four hours after injection. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance for repeated measures. Compared with control patients, the blood pressure-lowering effect of enalaprilat became apparent within 15 minutes and lasted for more than four hours (p = 0.008). It was mainly due to the reduction in systemic vascular resistance. Enalaprilat also induced a small decrease in myocardial perfusion pressure. Cardiac output, preload, heart rate, and systemic oxygenation were not affected by enalaprilat; Intravenous enalaprilat was found to be effective and safe in reducing postoperative hypertension after neurosurgery as assessed by its effects on central hemodynamics and systemic oxygenation.",0,0

Whether this leads to adverse cardiovascular events is unknown.; The Multicenter American Research Trial With Cilazapril After Angioplasty to Prevent Restenosis (MARCATOR) was a placebo-controlled trial with angiographic follow-up to determine the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril on the frequency of restenosis. In this trial, restenosis was defined as 1) angiographic minimum lumen diameter reduction > or = 0.72 mm between angioplasty and follow-up visit; and 2) > 50% diameter stenosis on follow-up angiogram. We identified 139 patients with successful angioplasty of coronary occlusion (Group 1) and compared the frequency of restenosis, reocclusion, and adverse cardiovascular events with that of 1295 patients with successful angioplasty of subtotal stenosis (Group 2); Restenosis occurred in 36 patients with occluded arteries (29%) vs 264 with non-occluded arteries (23%, p = 0.177) by definition 1 and in 62 patients with occluded arteries (49%) vs 478 with non-occluded arteries (42%, p = 0.119) by definition 2.

Through a psychophysiological study we evaluated the effect of verapamil (V) and enalapril (E), both in monotherapy and in association. Office BP was successfully lowered (< 145/90 mmHg) in 11 patients treated with V (V-Resp) and 10 patients treated with E (E-Resp). Both drugs were prescribed in 9 patients (V+E) who did not sufficiently lower their blood pressure (N-Resp) with monotherapy. The patients performed three stressors (color word stroop, cold pressor and handgrip). Extracardiovascular and hemodynamic functions were measured during the baseline, stress, and recovery periods. The response was evaluated by adding the changes that occurred in each phase of the psychophysiological session. This was done before filming and after any modification of the therapeutic intervention. Emotional arousal (frontal muscle contraction, skin conductance, peripheral temperature) was reduced when BP was normal. No changes in BP reactivity were found. HR response decreased in V-Resp and cardiac output increased in E-Resp while vascular response was restricted in E-Resp and V-Resp. This was also reduced in N-Resp when they took V+E and normalized their blood pressure. The findings indicate that sympathetic reactivity can be modified by therapy. In particular, verapamil restricted the cardiac stress response without decreasing cardiac output and was advantageously associated with enalapril to control the psychophysiological response in more resistant hypertensive patients.",0,0

Group C comprised 10 healthy volunteers as controls. Changes in baseline MA during exercise and after exercise were studied in the three groups. Normotensive patients, without metabolic alterations, with normal renal function and without proteinuria underwent an ergometric test up to 600 kg. This test was repeated after the administration of 20 mg of enalapril in a single daily dose for 60 days. Body weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, creatinine, and creatinine clearance were determined and did not show significant variations between groups or with treatment. Microalbuminuria was studied in the three groups with and without administration of enalapril throughout the 2 months of the study. The determinations were made under rest, exercise and post-exercise conditions. Mean baseline MA values +/- SEM were as follows: at rest, 5.22 +/- 0.49, 58.36 +/- 13.24, and 4.73 +/- 0.45 micrograms/min for groups A, B and C, respectively; with exercise, 15.19 +/- 4.43, 74.70 +/- 14.89 and 16.76 +/- 4.62 micrograms/min for groups A, B and C, respectively; and post exercise, 32.04 +/- 6.64, 253.15 +/- 63.88 and 9.23 +/- 3.25 micrograms/min, respectively. The geometric means of the initial to post-treatment MA ratio were as follows: at rest, 0.95, 1.59 (P < 0.01), and 1.03 for groups A, B, and C, respectively; with exercise, 1.53 (P < 0.01), 1.91 (P < 0.01), and 1.69 for groups A, B, and C, respectively; and post exercise, 2.94 (P < 0.01), 3.24 (P < 0.01) and 1.03 for groups A, B and C, respectively. In conclusion, given the early diagnostic suspicion of diabetic nephropathy, post-exercise MA screening during an ergometric test could be helpful.

A significant decrease in systolic and diastolic GFR, AER, and BP values was observed in normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients during antihypertensive therapy. The drop in GFR in the general population of NIDDM patients was significantly and inversely related to the decrease in mean BP (diastolic + 1/3 pulse pressure) (r = -0.80, P < 0.0001 ), but not with that of HbA1c, triglycerides and BMI. The decrease in GFR (mean +/- SE) per year in the normoalbuminuric patient was 2.03 +/- 0.66 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2 (95% CI: 0.92 -3.17) during treatment with cilazapril and 2.01 +/- 0.71 ml. min-1 x 1.73 m-2 (95% CI 0.82-3.11) during treatment with amlodipine. The decrease in GFR per year in the microalbuminuric patient was 2.15 +/- 0.69 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2 (95% CI 0.86-3.89) during cilazapril and 2 .33 +/- 0.83 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2 per year (95% CI 1.03-3.67) during amlodipine therapy. Cilazapril and amlodipine reduced AER to a similar degree in normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients. No significant changes were observed with respect to other clinical and biochemical characteristics between the two antihypertensive therapies and, in particular, plasma values of HbA1c, BMI, triglycerides and cholesterol. These results support the principle that hypertension plays a critical role in contributing to kidney damage in NIDDM, even when the AER is normal. However, the degree of BP control with both cilazapril and amlodipine can successfully delay the decline in GFR in hypertensive patients with NIDDM with or without early kidney disease.",0,0

Selective renal angiography was performed in all patients regardless of the results of the captopril test. Twenty patients demonstrated unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS), giving a prevalence of 43%. After placebo and after captopril there were no significant changes (absolute or proportional) in BP values between patients with essential hypertension or RAS, either for all measurements or if only BP drop was taken into account. Receiver-operator characteristic curves of baseline and post-captopril peripheral renin levels indicate that the captopril test does not adequately discriminate between patients with essential hypertension and RAS. Therefore, we do not recommend the use of the captopril test as a screening test for RAS in hypertensive patients in whom there is already a high level of clinical suspicion for RAS.",0,0

After initial dietary therapy, 4,209 asymptomatic patients who remained hyperglycemic (fasting plasma glucose levels, 6.0 to 15.0 mmol/L) were assigned to either a policy of conventional therapy, primarily diet alone, or a policy of intensive therapy, with the aim of controlling fasting plasma glucose. levels less than 6.0 mmol/L, with assignment to primary therapy with sulfonylurea or insulin (which increased insulin delivery) or metformin (which increased insulin sensitivity); The three modes of drug therapy in the intensively treated group (sulfonylurea, insulin, and metformin) had similar efficacy in reducing fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Over 9 years, patients assigned to intensive sulfonylurea or insulin therapy had lower fasting plasma glucose levels (median, 7.3 and 9.0 mmol/L, respectively) than patients assigned to conventional therapy. However, regardless of the assigned therapy, fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels increased and, in general, it was not feasible to maintain near-normal blood glucose. Even insulin therapy failed to achieve the therapeutic goal of near-normal blood glucose because of the difficulty of treating marked hyperglycemia and the risk of hypoglycemic episodes. Nine years after diabetes diagnosis, 29% of patients had a diabetes-related clinical endpoint, 20% had a macrovascular complication, and 9% had a microvascular complication; A report will be published in 1998 after a median duration from randomization of 11 years (range, 6 to 20 years) with power of 81% at the 1% level of significance to detect whether the improvement in control of glucose causes a 15% decrease. or increased incidence of major complications and whether any specific therapy is advantageous or disadvantageous.",0,0

Patients received perindopril 4 mg or amiloride 2.5/25 mg + hydrochlorothiazide once daily. Patients were then studied for a 3-month single-blind placebo prescription period.; After 6 months of treatment, systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced with perindopril (supine 11%, sitting 10%) and amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (supine 8%, sitting 12%). Diastolic blood pressure was also significantly decreased with perindopril (supine 8%, sitting 11%) and amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (supine 4%, sitting 9%). Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly during treatment with perindopril (by 9%) and amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (by 6%). Cardiac index was increased with perindopril (by 6%), due to an increased rate of stroke (by 5%), but amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide did not change cardiac function. The systemic vascular resistance index decreased significantly more with perindopril (by 14%) than with amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (by 8%). Common carotid artery compliance was significantly improved with perindopril (by 16%), but did not change with amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (1% difference). The difference between perindopril and amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide for carotid compliance was statistically significant. Common carotid artery compliance tended to increase more with perindopril (by 7%) than with amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide, leading to a 5% decrease in carotid artery compliance. After discontinuation of therapy, for both drugs, all treatment-induced changes reverted to pre-treatment values within 7 weeks; Elastic common carotid artery compliance was increased with perindopril, but not with amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide. The properties of the great arteries of the muscular arteries and systemic vascular resistance were improved with both drugs, but in general the changes were more pronounced with perindopril than with amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide. The present results indicate a more pronounced effect of perindopril at both the macro and microcirculatory levels, which will consequently lead to a greater decrease in cardiac afterload.

Blood pressure was measured by 24-h ambulatory monitoring; Enalapril and nifedipine-GITS significantly lowered blood pressure compared to placebo. Aspirin did not alter the antihypertensive effect of either drug. Indomethacin attenuated (by 45%) the antihypertensive effect of enalapril during the 24-hour evaluation period, but did not interfere with the effect of nifedipine. In addition, indomethacin significantly reduced fractional excretion of sodium and plasma prostaglandin levels similarly when added to the enalapril or nifedipine regimen; Vasodilatory prostaglandins are probably involved in the antihypertensive effects of enalapril but not nifedipine, and this interaction appears to be independent of any indomethacin-induced decrease in renal sodium excretion. Nifedipine may be an appropriate drug for the treatment of hypertensive patients who require concomitant treatment with NSAIDs.",0,0
1795,8562296,High prevalence of persistent cough with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in Chinese.,,"Woo, K S; Nicholls, M G","1. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. While generally well tolerated, a dry cough may develop, occasionally requiring termination of therapy. The reported prevalence of cough with ACE inhibitor therapy has ranged from 0.2% to 25%, depending on methods of data collection, analysis, and symptom reporting. 2. To assess the prevalence of cough in Chinese patients receiving ACE inhibitors, interviews were conducted with 191 patients in Hong Kong who were taking treatment including captopril or enalapril for hypertension or heart failure, and with 382 matched patients by sex and age receiving alternative treatment. medications that excluded an ACE inhibitor (controls). Patients and controls were blindly interviewed by the same interviewer using a common adverse event questionnaire. 3. Persistent cough was reported in 44% of patients taking an ACE inhibitor (46% of those taking captopril and 41.8% of patients taking enalapril) and 11.1% of controls (P < 0.001). The prevalence of other adverse reactions was similar, with no significant differences between the two treatment groups. The complication of cough was not significantly related to age, gender, underlying disease, drug dose, or smoking status. 4. This study indicates that cough is a common side effect of ACE inhibitor therapy in Hong Kong Chinese, although discontinuation of therapy is not necessary in most patients. If the Chinese are particularly susceptible to ACE inhibitor cough, a formal prospective study comparing Chinese and non-Chinese patients is required.",0,0

Seventeen patients (8 males, 9 females, 6 whites, 11 blacks) completed both phases of the study, which consisted of two 5-week treatment periods separated by 2 weeks of placebo treatment. Each drug was randomly assigned to half of the patients as the first drug and the other half as the second drug they received. Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was performed the day before treatment and the last day of each active treatment. Both drugs were effective and well tolerated, but isradipine was more effective overall than captopril in lowering BP (9.4% vs 3.9%, respectively; P < 0.02). Black patients had significantly higher BP at baseline than white patients; furthermore, black patients responded better to isradipine than to captopril. White patients had less blood pressure lowering with both drugs than black patients, but white patients achieved lower diastolic BP with captopril than black patients (88 +/- 2 mm Hg vs. 96 +/- 9 mm Hg, P < 0.01). There was no correlation between pretreatment plasma levels of pressor hormones (plasma renin activity, catecholamines, and arginine vasopressin) and the magnitude of BP response to either drug, but BP lowering in response to captopril was significantly correlated with the increase in plasma renin. activity during treatment (r = -0.84; P < 0.05).

We have studied the use of an added angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor as a third agent; In an observational study in hospital and outpatient settings, 92 patients with advanced breast cancer were treated with epirubicin at a cumulative dose of 360 to 1,000 mg/m2 (median 1,000). Of 85 evaluable, nine developed life-threatening CHF between 1.5 and 13 months after ending epirubicin. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased from normal to 18% to 35%. All received furosemide and digoxin, and then, after transient clinical relief, enalapril or ramipril (initially 1.25 mg orally daily, increasing to 10-15 mg after 4-6 weeks); Eight of the nine patients deteriorated while taking digoxin/diuretic. Within 3 months of starting the ACE inhibitor in these patients, the LVEF had increased to normal or near normal. Only one patient died of heart failure. Follow-up ranged from 11 to 42 months (median 26). The ACE inhibitor was well tolerated, with no hypotension at the first dose, except in one patient who discontinued treatment after 6 months due to persistent cough. Two others stopped treatment with their ACE inhibitor after 22 and 28 months because they felt fine.

The duration of diabetes, blood pressure values, and metabolic status are the main determinants of the course of nephropathy, and microalbuminuria is the hallmark of its onset. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors offer important renoprotection to hypertensive and normotensive patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Our study extends previous observations on the duration and effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in advanced kidney disease.; Randomized controlled double-blind (first phase) and open (second phase) controlled study of 7 years. Ninety-four normotensive patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with serum creatinine levels less than 123.76 mumol/L (1.4 mg/dL) and who had microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg/24 h) received enalapril maleate 10 mg /d, or placebo, for 5 years.

Blood pressure, pulse rate, weight, adverse effects, and laboratory studies were evaluated after moexipril at 7.5 or 15 mg once daily or 7.5 or 15 mg daily in combination with 25 mg. of hydrochlorothiazide if sitting DBP remained > or = 90 mm Hg with moexipril monotherapy The primary measure of efficacy was a change from baseline in sitting DBP. Secondary outcome measures included changes in sitting DBP, pulse rate, laboratory parameters, and adverse side effects. After 1 year of therapy in 135 patients, BP fell 16/14 mm Hg among patients receiving moexipril monotherapy and 27/17 mm Hg for those receiving combination therapy compared to baseline (P < 0.001 for both) . After 2 years of treatment, the reductions were similar in 120 patients. Nineteen patients (11%) were prematurely withdrawn from the study due to inadequate therapeutic response and 28 (16%) due to adverse experiences. There were no significant changes in pulse rate or postural reductions in BP with moexipril alone or in combination therapy. Three adverse side effects occurred with a frequency greater than 2% that were possibly or probably attributed to moexipril or combination therapy: hypotension (2%), dizziness (6%), and increased cough (12%). There were no clinically relevant group mean changes from baseline laboratory values in the treatment groups. In conclusion, these long-term data demonstrate that moexipril, either alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, has long-term antihypertensive efficacy and is generally well tolerated in elderly patients with hypertension.",0,0

Blood pressure, EGF, and microalbumin excretion were measured at baseline and throughout the treatment period; A significant drop in SBP was noted in the enalapril group and in DBP in the nitrendipine group. In the enalapril group, EGF excretion progressively increased from 188 to 214 nmol/mmol creatinine after 6 weeks and to 274 after 8 months of treatment (p = 0.03). There was a significant drop in albumin excretion while patients were taking enalapril, but in the nitrendipine group, neither albuminuria nor EGF excretion changed significantly. There was no correlation between better EGF excretion and a decrease in albuminuria or BP; The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril has been effective in lowering albumin and increasing EGF excretion. Measurement of urinary EGF may provide a valuable new index of renal function.",0,0

Age-matched untreated SHR (n = 16) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) (n = 17) rats served as controls. The experiments were performed at 40 weeks; Withdrawal of captopril treatment resulted in a rapid rebound of SBP to a level close to untreated SHR in the low-dose group, while a persistently lower SBP was maintained in the high-dose group. Both doses of captopril treatment completely prevented hypertrophy of the arteriolar resistance vessel wall or muscular vessels. Captopril decreased the left ventricular mass:body weight ratio in a dose-dependent manner. High-dose captopril improved systolic and diastolic function at rest and on exertion. Thoracic angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner with captopril treatment. Perfusion pressure response curves to incremental doses of phenylephrine were shifted to the right in both captopril treatment groups compared with those in the SHR control. Addition of L-NAME and L-arginine to the infusate increased or attenuated vasoconstrictor activity in all rats, whereas high-dose captopril completely restored the abnormal hypersensitivity to L-NAME and caused less attenuation in response to L-arginine. in the rats. control SHR.; The persistent decrease in blood pressure caused by early captopril treatment was primarily attributed to sustained normalization of resistance vessel structure and function, which may be partially mediated by improved endothelial cell function. Persistent reduction in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in the blood vessel wall attenuated left ventricular hypertrophy, and improved cardiac systolic and diastolic function may also contribute to the sustained hypotensive effect.",0,0

Follow-up lasted 1 year.; A composite outcome of the following measures was used to define success: attendance at the 12-month visit; at least nine supine DBP measurements during the study; and median supine DBP < 90 mmHg and a reduction of at least 10 mmHg compared to baseline. Failure was defined as one or more of those criteria not being met. Equivalence was concluded if the 95% confidence interval for success rates differed between two groups by less than +/- 10%. Clinical safety and subjective quality of life were also evaluated.; No statistically significant differences were observed in the change in DBP or systolic blood pressure between the groups.

In 83 and 79 patients, respectively, slow-release lisinopril and nifedipine produced similar reductions in blood pressure (systolic/diastolic: -16/-13 mmHg supine and -14/-11 mmHg standing after lisinopril; -15 /-12 mmHg in the supine position). and -14/-11 mmHg of nifedipine at rest). Fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and plasma lipids did not appear to be affected by either agent. Furthermore, 28% of patients treated with lisinopril and 30% of those treated with nifedipine had microalbuminuria. Both drugs induced a reduction in the albumin excretion rate (AER). The geometric mean of the tolerance factor x of the reduction in AER among the 23 microalbuminuric patients treated with lisinopril (-10.0 x:1.3 micrograms/min) was greater, although not significantly, than that observed in the 26 treated with nifedipine (-0.9 x 1.2 micrograms/min). Furthermore, lisinopril appeared to be better tolerated than nifedipine in our study population. Microalbuminuria is an important risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in non-insulin dependent diabetic patients, as well as in the general population. At present, it is unknown to what extent a reduction in AER could improve diabetic patients. Finally, both lisinopril and nifedipine showed a similar antihypertensive effect in these patients that was not associated with significant differences in plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, or lipids.

The study consisted of a 4-week placebo washout phase and a 12-week active treatment phase. Patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension were considered for study participation. To enter the treatment phase of the study, a mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) > or = 95 and < or = 115 mm Hg was required. Patients received losartan 50 mg once daily or enalapril 5 mg once daily at randomization. Enalapril dose could be adjusted to 10 mg after 4 weeks and HCTZ 25 mg could be added after 8 weeks, based on SiDBP measurements at clinic visits. The losartan dose was kept at 50 mg; HCTZ 12.5 mg can be added after 8 weeks. Changes in treatment regimen were required at each step if SiDBP remained > or = mm Hg. Diuretic doses were chosen based on commercially available forms of the test agents in combination with HCTZ. Trough blood pressure, heart rate, and safety parameters were measured at 4-week intervals during the treatment phase of the study. Significant reductions in mean DBP and mean sitting systolic blood pressure (SAPSi) were achieved at all time points (4, 8, and 12 weeks) with both treatments. No significant differences were observed between treatment groups for mean changes in SiDBP or SiSBP overall. At the end of the study, patients receiving the losartan regimen had a mean reduction in SiDBP of 10.3 mm Hg, while patients on the enalapril regimen had a mean reduction of 9.8 mm Hg. Also, the percentage of patients who achieved the goal of blood pressure reduction was not significantly different between the groups. The mean reduction in SiDBP, but not SiSBP, in black patients was slightly greater in the losartan group than in the enalapril group (SiDBP, 10.0 mm Hg losartan vs 8.0 mm Hg enalapril; P = 0 .02). Similarly, losartan patients aged 65 years and older had a slightly greater decrease in SiDBP than comparable enalapril patients (12.7 mm Hg vs. 8.7 mm Hg; P = 0.03). The importance of these differences between subgroups needs to be clarified by further studies. In general, both treatments were well tolerated. A regimen of losartan alone or in combination with HCTZ was effective in treating patients with essential hypertension and was comparable to a regimen of enalapril alone or in combination with HCTZ. However, losartan treatment was associated with a lower incidence of cough.",0,0

We offer a model that can be used to systematically map the pathways through which ADR can lead to innovative research. These pathways include chemical, therapeutic, or pathophysiological steps that can be taken to arrive at new RAM-based insights. We use the development of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, especially captopril, as a case study. The similarity between the ADR profiles of captopril and penicillamine was a starting point for further innovation. Historical analysis shows that, in several cases, research in the field of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been triggered by ADRs. The model presented here could be applicable to other areas of innovative drug research.",0,0

Large trials have shown a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with long-term use of ACE inhibitors in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, or acute myocardial infarction. Reductions in acute ischemic events (eg, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and need for early revascularization) were independent of ejection fraction and were greater than would be expected from the small reduction in blood pressure that was observed. produced, suggesting that other patients with coronary artery disease may benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. This hypothesis is being tested in multiple double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials with follow-up durations of 3 to 5 years that will involve approximately 30,000 patients. Trials vary with respect to patient population (eg, normotensive versus hypertensive, normolipidemic versus hyperlipidemic, with versus without diabetes mellitus), the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used, and outcome measures. When available, the results of these clinical trials could have very important implications for the role of long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in preventing or delaying the development of atherosclerosis-related ischemic events.",0,0

The choice of drug should be made on the basis of its pharmacodynamic properties, clinical effects, advantages, and contraindications. In addition, rapid blood pressure reduction carries considerable risk, if done in an uncontrolled manner, leading to further target organ damage. The goal of treatment is not just to lower blood pressure, but to do so with minimal adverse effects while preserving organ function.",0,0
1828,8615323,"Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme, autonomic and hemodynamic activity in patients with heart failure who perform isometric exercise.",,"Willenbrock, R; Ozcelik, C; Osterziel, K J; Dietz, R","The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on autonomic responses and hemodynamics in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) undergoing isometric exercise have not been studied. We tested whether acute ACE inhibitors could influence the effects of isometric exercise in patients with CHF. In the first part of the study, we showed that isometric exercise increased blood pressure in the control group and the CHF group, while cardiac output increased only in the control group. Stroke volume was unchanged in the control group, while it was significantly decreased in the CHF group. Next, we analyzed the effect of acute ACE inhibitors (ramipril 5 mg) on the decrease in cardiac output during isometric stress in patients with CHF. During isometric exercise, mean arterial pressure and heart rate increased similarly in both groups. However, cardiac output decreased during placebo by -0.48 +/- 0.12 L/min (p < 0.01), but not during ACE inhibitors. Spectral analysis of blood pressure showed an increase (p < 0.01) in the high-frequency parasympathetic component from 7.3% +/- 3.6% to 18.1% +/- 9.5% after ACEI. Plasma norepinephrine levels increased after isometric stress in the placebo group, while other hormones did not change. ACE inhibitors prevented the increase in norepinephrine after isometric stress. Therefore, the decrease in cardiac output during isometric exercise in CHF patients was prevented by acute ACE inhibitors. The effect of ACE inhibition may be related to reduced sympathetic activity.",0,0
1829,8621193,Improvement of coronary flow reserve after long-term therapy with enalapril.,,"Motz, W; Strauer, B E","To date, no clinical study shows an improvement in coronary flow reserve due to long-term antihypertensive therapy. Given the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to the hypertensive remodeling process of the heart and coronary circulation, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) could act as cardioreparative drugs in arterial hypertension. Consequently, our aim in this investigation was to examine under clinical conditions to what extent long-term antihypertensive treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor improved diminished coronary flow reserve in hypertensive patients with microvascular angina pectoris. For comparison purposes, we also treated a normotensive control group of 6 patients with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Fifteen hypertensive individuals (10 men, 5 women; age, 58 +/- 6 years) were treated with enalapril (10 to 20 mg/d; mean, 16.7 +/- 4.9 mg/d) for 11 to 13 months. At the end of the treatment period, systolic pressure decreased from 178 +/- 14 to 137 +/- 12 mm Hg and diastolic pressure from 102 +/- 11 to 86 +/- 4 mm Hg under ambulatory conditions. Left ventricular muscle mass index decreased by 8% from 149 +/- 32 to 137 +/- 28 g/m2 (p < 0.05). Peak coronary blood flow after dipyridamole increased by 43% from 181 +/- 69 to 258 +/- 116 mL/min per 100 g (P < 0.001), and trough coronary vascular resistance decreased by 29%, from 0.66 +/- 0.23 to 0.47 +/- 0.24 mm Hg x min x 100 g x mL-1 (P < 0.001) after treatment with enalapril. Consequently, the calculated coronary reserve increased from 2.2 +/- 0.6 to 3.3 +/- 1.2 (p < 0.001). After treatment with enalapril, the functional class of angina pectoris according to the Canadian classification system had changed from 2.5 +/- 0.6 to 1.5 +/- 0.6 (p < 0.01). Maximum work capacity had increased from 23.775 +/- 3.970 to 26.255 +/- 4.598 J (mean +/- SE, P < 0.05). Peak ST-segment depression at peak workload was reduced from 0.18 +/- 0.02 to 0.06 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SE, (P < 0.01). In summary, long-term therapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril should be considered a cardioreparative treatment with regard to coronary microcirculation in hypertensive heart disease.",0,0

All groups received intensive lifestyle counseling to achieve weight loss, reduction of dietary sodium and alcohol, and increased physical activity; - Changes in plasma total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides from baseline to annual visits over 4 years; - Mean changes in all plasma lipids were favorable in all groups. The degree of weight loss with fat-modified diet and exercise was significantly associated with favorable changes in lipids. Significant differences (p < 0.01) between groups were observed for mean changes during follow-up for each lipid. The decreases in plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were greater with doxazosin and acebutolol (for plasma total cholesterol, 0.36 and 0.30 mmol/L [13.8 and 11.7 mg/dL], respectively), lower with chlorthalidone and placebo (0.12 and 0.13 mmol/L [4.5 and 5.1 mg/dL], respectively). Triglyceride decreases were greater with doxazosin and enalapril, less with acebutolol. Increases in HDL cholesterol were greater with enalapril and doxazosin, less so with acebutolol. Significant relative increases in plasma total cholesterol with chlorthalidone compared with placebo at 12 months were no longer present at 24 months and beyond, when the mean plasma total cholesterol for the chlorthalidone group fell below baseline. . Analyzes of participants who continued to receive chlorthalidone throughout the 4-year follow-up indicated that this was not solely due to an increasing percentage of participants switching or discontinuing medication use during follow-up; - Weight loss with a fat-modified diet plus increased exercise produces favorable long-term effects on blood pressure and all plasma lipid fractions in adults with stage I hypertension; Blood pressure reduction is improved to a similar degree by the addition of a drug from any of the 5 antihypertensive drug classes. These drugs differ quantitatively by influencing the degree of favorable long-term effects on blood lipids obtained with nutritional-hygienic treatment.",0,0

Sometimes their identification is helpful in understanding the etiology or mechanism of the disorder. The authors applied Fourier transform infrared microscopy (FTIRM) to the molecular characterization of crystal deposits in tissue and compared the results with those provided by histological studies using polarized light microscopy and histochemical reactions. Twenty-five biopsies were investigated. In 10 cases, the results were in good agreement. In 15 cases, only FTIRM was able to accurately identify the crystals. In three cases, this technique allowed the characterization of dihydroxyadenine crystals that revealed a previously undiagnosed adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency in patients with severe chronic renal failure. In three cases, crystal deposition was related to drug therapy.

1833,8629540,Angiotensin-II receptor antagonists: a new class of antihypertensive agents.,,"Weir, M R","Pharmacological agents that attenuate the influence of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are known to reduce systemic blood pressure through vasodilatory action and increase renal sodium and water clearance. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are known to antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system through their ability to inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. A new class of antihypertensive agents, the angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, has recently been developed. These agents specifically block the angiotensin II receptor, thereby limiting angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction and reducing aldosterone secretion. These effects result in a reduction in systemic blood pressure through reduced vascular tone and increased sodium and water clearance. Clinical trials have shown the efficacy of these agents in lowering blood pressure. These newer antihypertensive agents also have uricosuric actions and are well tolerated, with a low incidence of cough and angioedema, side effects seen with ACE inhibitors. Clinical trials are underway to see if these drugs will be useful in treating conditions other than high blood pressure, such as congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease.",0,0

In 10 patients with congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 29 +/- 2%), LV function was assessed during upright cycling exercise using an ambulatory radionuclide detector for continuous noninvasive monitoring of cardiac function. Exercise was performed during control conditions and after a 3-week treatment with digoxin (0.25 mg/day orally) or placebo. Ten normal volunteers matched for sex and age constituted the control group. In normals, exercise ejection fraction and end-diastolic volume increased (both p < 0.001), while end-systolic volume progressively decreased (p < 0.001). Under control conditions, patients with congestive heart failure had a sharp increase in heart rate during exercise, while ejection fraction did not change; end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes increased significantly (both p < 0.001) during exercise. During treatment with digoxin, the heart rate response to exercise recorded in patients with CHF was comparable to that recorded in normal subjects. In addition, a significant increase in ejection fraction was detected during exercise (P < 0.001), and the increase in end-systolic volume was significantly less than that observed under control conditions (P < 0.05). When patients received placebo, LV function responses to exercise were comparable to those seen in control conditions.

Ten patients were studied after a 2-week placebo run-in period and, after 8 weeks of active treatment, a 2-week placebo washout was allowed between treatments. At the end of each period, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured as clearance of 51Cr-EDTA and 123I-hipurane, respectively, and tubular function was determined using the clearance technique. of lithium. Both drugs maintained GFR and ERPF and reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP, mm Hg) to a similar degree (time x treatment, P = 0.466): amlodipine from 126.9 +/- 2.5 to 115.9 + /- 2.2; perindopril from 126.9 +/- 2.5 to 117.9 +/- 3.9 (time effect of all treatments together, P = 0.003).

In a multivariable model, plasma BNP (P = 0.021), but not ANP (P = 0.638) or N-ANP (P = 0.782), provided additional prognostic information beyond left ventricular ejection fraction. Logistic regression analysis showed that ANP (P = 0.003) and N-ANP (P = 0.027), but not BNP (P = 0.14), were significantly associated with left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 45%. ; These results suggest that plasma BNP determination provides important and independent prognostic information after AMI. Although plasma ANP appears to be a better predictor of left ventricular dysfunction, plasma BNP may have greater potential to complement standard prognostic indicators used in risk stratification after AMI due to its strong independent association with long-term survival. long-term, greater in vitro stability and simplicity of analysis.",0,0

Urinary excretion of 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha, stable breakdown products of prostacyclin, was measured after a 1-month run-in period. To determine whether lowering blood pressure (BP) influenced prostacyclin biosynthesis, 106 consenting patients with diastolic pressure 90-120 mm Hg were randomly assigned to treatment with bendrofluazide, metoprolol, quinapril, or amlodipine in a randomized design. open parallel group. The dose was increased to reduce diastolic blood pressure to <90 mm Hg. Terazosin was added if this BP goal was not reached and its dose was increased if necessary. Urinary prostaglandin excretion rates were measured after 1 year in patients in whom target diastolic pressure was achieved. Mean arterial pressure ranged from 106 to 168 mm Hg in untreated patients, and excretion of both prostacyclin derivatives ranged from <5 to >350 ng/g creatinine.

After a 2-week placebo period, patients received either trandolapril 0.5 mg or nitrendipine 10 mg once daily for 15 days. At the end of this period, based on forced titration, the dose was increased to trandolapril 2 mg or nitrendipine 20 mg once daily for 2 months. Seventy-three hypertensive patients, older than 65 years, entered the study. Demographic data and baseline blood pressure (BP) level were comparable in the two groups.

Time- and frequency-domain measures of HR variability were compared in randomly selected age-matched populations of 188 normotensive and 168 hypertensive men (mean age 50 +/- 6 years for both). The standard deviation of the RR intervals was lower in hypertensive subjects than in normotensive subjects (52 +/- 19 vs 59 +/- 20 mss; p < 0.01), and the very low and low frequency spectral components of the HR variability analyzed as absolute units was reduced in hypertensive patients relative to normotensive controls (p < 0.001 for both). Hypertensive subjects also had moderate changes in normalized low-frequency and high-frequency components in response to an upright (sitting) posture (NS) compared with normotensive subjects (p < 0.001 for both). Multiple regression analysis showed that the standard deviation of the RR intervals is more strongly predicted by systolic blood pressure, both in patients with hypertension (beta--0.20, p=0.01) and in normotensive subjects (beta-- 0.28, p= 0.0002). After adjustment for baseline differences in blood pressure and body mass index, neither the absolute measures of HR variability nor the responses of normalized units of HR variability to a change in body posture differed. between hypertensive subjects and normotensive controls. These data show that long-standing hypertension results in reduced overall heart rate variability and blunted autonomic responses to a change in body posture. Altered autonomic modulation of HR in hypertension is primarily due to elevated blood pressure and obesity in men with long-standing hypertension compared with normotensive subjects.",0,0

V-HeFT III researchers.,,"Boden, W E; Ziesche, S; Carson, P E; Conrad, C H; Syat, D; Cohn, J N","Therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and nonselective vasodilators (hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate) has become an accepted treatment in patients with symptomatic chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), and has been shown in large clinical trials to improve symptoms, improve exercise performance and reduce cardiac mortality. However, the management of patients with CHF remains a therapeutic challenge. The second Vasodilator Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT II) showed that the mean 2-year mortality with enalapril (18%) was significantly lower than with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate (25%), but surprisingly, vasodilators nonspecific drugs produced a significantly greater improvement in exercise performance and left ventricular function. These data suggest that improvement in symptoms, hemodynamics, and survival may not be achieved by using a single class of vasodilator therapy, but could be optimized by the combined use of different agents. This report describes the rationale and design of V-HeFT III, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the effects of chronic oral extended-release felodipine (felodipine ER) 2.5 to 5 mg twice daily, when added to a stable regimen of enalapril and loop diuretics, with or without digoxin, on exercise performance, morbidity, and mortality in patients with New York Heart Association functional class II to III CHF followed for a minimum of 12 weeks. Felodipine is a second-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a high degree of vascular selectivity that, at the doses used in this study, exerts its systemic arterial effect by lowering peripheral vascular resistance without producing negative inotropic effects. The results of V-HeFT III may shed important light on the role of additive vasodilator therapy in the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure.",0,0

We examined whether alacepril, a new long-acting oral ACE inhibitor, has beneficial effects against exercise-induced angina in patients with stable exertional angina after substantial isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) treatment. Thirteen men with stable exertional angina were treated with oral ISDN (80 mg/day) for >3 weeks. After this period, the efficacy of single oral administration of alacepril (50 mg) or its placebo on exercise-induced angina and electrocardiographic changes was examined by treadmill stress test in a double-blind crossover design. Alacepril significantly improved exercise duration by 9.1% (p=0.03), time to 1mm ST-segment depression by 19% (p<0.01), and maximal ST-segment depression by 33% (p=0.015) compared to placebo. Alacepril did not significantly alter the rate-pressure product, a marker of myocardial oxygen demand, during exercise testing compared to placebo. Plasma renin activity increased significantly (p<0.05) after alacepril administration, indicating that alacepril significantly blocked ACE activity in our patients. In conclusion, a single oral administration of the ACE inhibitor alacepril (50 mg) elicited beneficial effects against exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with stable exertional angina during chronic nitrate treatment. These effects may be mediated by increased coronary blood flow.",0,0

This symptom is also commonly reported in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as therapy for heart failure or hypertension, although the underlying mechanism is unknown. We have investigated the possibility that the inflammatory peptide bradykinin, normally degraded by ACE, causes sensitization of airway sensory nerves and enhancement of the cough reflex in conscious guinea pigs. Treatment of guinea pigs for two weeks with captopril caused an increased cough response to inhaled citric acid, which was prevented by concomitant treatment with the bradykinin receptor antagonist icatibant. A similar increase in cough elicited by icatibant-sensitive citric acid was observed in untreated animals after prior inhalation of bradykinin, although cough elicited by hypertonic saline was not affected. In in vitro electrophysiological studies, single vagal C-fiber responses to capsaicin, applied to the receptive fields of single-fiber units in the trachea, were also markedly increased after bradykinin perfusion, whereas vagal single-fiber responses A delta to hypertonic saline were not affected. These results indicate that bradykinin-induced sensitization of airway sensory nerves may underlie the pathogenesis of ACE-inhibitor cough.

Furthermore, a more active renin-angiotensin system in adipose tissue may contribute to insulin-resistant lipolysis in hypertensive subjects with abdominal obesity. We determined concentrations and turnover of non-esterified fatty acids, as well as lipid oxidation under basal conditions and during steady-state euglycemia with two levels of insulinemia (72 and 287 pmol/L) in lean normotensive subjects, normotensive subjects with abdominal obesity. and hypertensive with abdominal obesity. To assess the role of the renin-angiotensin system in determining non-esterified fatty acid turnover, we repeated the studies in hypertensive subjects with abdominal obesity after double-blind random assignment to placebo or enalapril for 1 month each. The main findings were as follows: (1) Non-esterified fatty acid flux was significantly higher in hypertensive subjects with abdominal obesity at both insulin levels than in normotensive subjects with abdominal obesity or normotensive lean subjects and was significantly correlated with both blood pressure mean as with total systemic resistance during the highest level of insulinemia. (2) Enalapril significantly improved insulin resistant lipolysis in hypertensive subjects with abdominal obesity. Enhancement in insulin suppression of non-esterified fatty acid efflux at high hormone concentrations was positively correlated with the magnitude of blood pressure reduction. (3) Basal lipid oxidation and suppression in response to insulin were similarly affected in both obese groups. Resistance to the antilipolytic actions of insulin is therefore a characteristic feature in hypertensive subjects with abdominal obesity and may be related to elevated blood pressure in these individuals. A more active renin-angiotensin system may partly explain the insulin-resistant lipolysis in this form of hypertension.",0,0

Of these patients, 1749 (67%) were randomly assigned to receive oral trandolapril or placebo from days 3 to 7 after infarction. The follow-up period was 2 to 4 years. Trandolapril reduced all-cause mortality, with a relative risk reduction associated with trandolapril treatment of 0.78 (p = 0.0013). The benefit was seen within 1 month of treatment. Trandolapril also reduced cardiovascular death (relative risk 0.75, p=0.001), sudden death (relative risk 0.76, p=0.03), and progression to severe/resistant heart failure (relative risk 0.71, p=0.03). p = 0.003).

More than 80% of patients in both treatment groups reached the target dose of 4 mg trandolapril or placebo at the end of dose titration. Nearly half of the patients in both treatment groups stopped taking study medication before death or trial closure. The need for open-label ACE inhibition was the reason for discontinuation in 48 and 75 patients in the trandolapril and placebo groups, respectively. In conclusion, long-term treatment with trandolapril in patients with reduced left ventricular function shortly after myocardial infarction significantly reduced mortality and morbidity. Most patients received the target dose of 4 mg trandolapril daily.

We tested this treatment modality in 70 hypertensive patients with severe kidney disease of various aetiologies. We present a double-blind study of the effect of enalapril 5 mg once daily compared with placebo in patients with non-diabetic severe chronic renal failure (plasma creatinine 2.8 to 6.8 mg/dl; mean creatinine clearance 15 ml/min/1.73 m2) followed for up to 2 years. Efficacy parameters were slopes of 51Cr-EDTA clearance, reciprocal of plasma creatinine, creatinine clearance, and effect on urinary protein excretion. Thirty-one patients completed 2 years of treatment (12 in the enalapril group and 19 in the placebo group). Two patients died of nonrenal causes (one patient each in the enalapril and placebo groups), 16 patients started dialysis (seven in the enalapril group and nine in the placebo group), and eight patients discontinued due to adverse events ( five in the enalapril group and three in the placebo group). Eleven patients discontinued treatment because they were noncompliant, uncooperative, or transferred (nine in the enalapril group and two in the placebo group). Two patients treated with enalapril were withdrawn from the study due to protocol deviations. Importantly, the statistical approach in this study evaluated all patients, regardless of treatment duration. A linear mixed-effects model and intention-to-treat analysis, taking into account the number of observations per patient, indicated that enalapril significantly reduced the rate of deterioration of kidney disease: glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.038), reciprocal of plasma creatinine (P = 0.017), or creatinine clearance (P = 0.031). The renal protective effects of enalapril have been shown to be in addition to its antihypertensive effect when blood pressure is held constant. Proteinuria was reduced with enalapril (p = 0.007) and slightly increased in patients treated with placebo (p = 0.051). The difference between these two groups was highly significant (P = 0.002). In conclusion, enalapril delayed the progression of chronic renal failure, as assessed by changes in glomerular filtration rate, creatinine clearance, and 1/plasma creatinine, and reduced proteinuria in patients with non-diabetic severe chronic renal failure.",0,0

Influence of enalapril.,,"SylvÃ©n, C; Hagerman, I; Karlberg, K E; Chen, J; Wallin, R; Eneroth, P; BergstrÃ¶m, K; Saldeen, T","In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study with enalapril, 74 patients with acute myocardial infarction were followed up at 0, 7, 30, 60, and 180 days after the event. Platelets and leukocytes were activated during the first 7 days. During the 6-month period, fibrinogen, leukocytes, elastase, and B beta 30-43 remained elevated in 50%, 15%, 30%, and 80% of patients, respectively, but there was no detectable angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in platelets. Enalapril did not modulate fibrinogen, leukocyte count or elastase, while peptide B beta 30-43 showed decreased levels, although the proportion of patients with values above the reference limit did not differ from placebo. In conclusion, in the 6-month period after acute myocardial infarction, while platelet function is activated only during the first week after acute myocardial infarction, fibrinogen and leukocyte function continue to be active throughout the 6 months in a considerable proportion of patients. These signs may indicate an ongoing atherosclerotic process. Enalapril has no major influence on these reactivities.",0,0

An initial dose of 10 mg once daily was titrated as tolerated to 40 mg once daily. All patients received diuretic therapy; digoxin was optional. The primary endpoint was maximal cycling exercise time; a secondary endpoint was the occurrence of the following prospectively defined and ranked clinical events indicating worsening heart failure: death, study discontinuation, hospitalization, emergency room visits, and need for supplemental diuretics. At the end of the study (last value obtained for each patient), cycling exercise time increased more with fosinopril (38.1 s) than with placebo (23.5 s) (P = 0.101 by ANCOVA and 0.010 by point analysis). prospectively defined dropout-adjusted endpoint).

Analysis of the occurrence of individual clinical events showed that the need for diuretic supplementation was markedly reduced with fosinopril (8% vs. 20% of patients, P=0.002), as were hospitalizations (3% vs. 12% of patients, P = 0.002) and dropouts from the study (2% vs 12% of patients, P < 0.001) due to worsening heart failure; the two groups had similar incidences of death (3% of patients in the fosinopril group vs. 2% in the placebo group, P = 0.723). In addition, symptoms of dyspnea (P = 0.017), fatigue (P = 0.019), and NYHA functional class (P = 0.008) were improved with fosinopril relative to placebo. In conclusion, fosinopril, at an initial dose of 10 mg once daily, subsequently adjusted for tolerance to 40 mg once daily, increased exercise tolerance and reduced the frequency of clinical events indicative of worsening heart failure.",1,0

Studies evaluating only the presence or absence of hyperresponsiveness to this agent have produced conflicting results. Spirometric tests were performed before and after methacholine in 14 hypertensive patients at least two weeks after stopping these inhibitors, when the cough had abated or disappeared. Subjects were predominantly female (86%), non-smokers (93%), with a high prevalence of atopic respiratory diseases (57%), likely due to ethnicity (72% Hispanic). Spirometric values of premethacoline were normal. Post-methacholine bronchoconstriction of varying degrees was observed in seven patients, but reached the level of hyperresponsiveness in only one patient with asthma. The other seven subjects did not exhibit bronchoconstriction. The two groups did not differ in age, comorbidities (eg, atopy), and medications, or blood pressure reduction. We conclude that airway responses to cholinergic stimulation show no common pattern and are randomly distributed in hypertensive patients who develop angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough.",0,0

The relationship between calcium and magnesium concentrations in skeletal muscle before treatment predicted blood pressure response during active treatment (r = -0.38, P < 0.02). During treatment, the change in blood pressure was related to the change in the muscle Ca/Mg ratio (r = 0.35, p < 0.05), especially in patients treated with lisinopril. Thus, in the present study an association was found between the balance of calcium and magnesium in skeletal muscle and the response of blood pressure to antihypertensive treatment.",0,0

Temporal study of glucose infusion rate during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp.,,"Valensi, P; Derobert, E; Genthon, R; Riou, J P","To assess the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on insulin action in obesity, five normotensive non-diabetic obese women were examined on two occasions as part of a double-blind, randomized, crossover study involving ten days of treatment with 1.25 mg ramipril or placebo. The study consisted of a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (two periods of insulin infusion at a rate of 0.4 and 1 mU/kg/min, 2 h for each step) combined with indirect calorimetry. The most notable results involved a significantly faster time course of glucose infusion rates during the first 30 minutes of each insulin infusion period [analyzed by calculating slopes (S1 and S2)] after ramipril administration. that of placebo. Mean glucose infusion rates achieved during the last 30 min of each insulin infusion period (G1 and G2), as well as increases in carbohydrate oxidation rates during clamping (C1-C0 and C2-C0) and decreases in non-esterified fats in plasma. acids (A0-A1 and A0-A2), were not significantly different after ramipril and placebo. Based on robust principal component analysis of S1, S2, G1, G2, C1, C2, A1, and A2 (orthogonally to C0 and A0), insulin sensitivity was improved with ramipril compared with placebo (p = 0.013). This study strongly suggests that a low dose of an ACE inhibitor increases the activation phase of insulin action in obese normotensive non-diabetic patients and may accelerate insulin action.",0,0

Power spectral analysis of 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring was performed in 30 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline, after 1 year of lisinopril treatment, and after 1 month of drug discontinuation. In parallel, the patients underwent 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, an echocardiographic study, and an evaluation of plasma renin activity. Lisinopril treatment increased plasma renin activity and reduced 24-hour systolic and diastolic pressures (from 159 +/- 14 to 121 +/- 8 and from 103 +/- 7 to 80 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively) and index left ventricular mass (from 159 +/- 33 to 134 +/- 26 g/m2); In addition, in 12 of 30 patients, normalization of the left ventricular mass was achieved. Drug withdrawal was followed by an increase in blood pressure with no change in left ventricular mass. In the total study population, only high-frequency power was higher after lisinopril treatment. In the subgroup of patients with normalized left ventricular mass, high-frequency diurnal and nocturnal powers, as well as total and very low-frequency nocturnal powers, were higher after 1 year of treatment than at baseline. In the remaining 18 patients, power spectrum measurements after treatment were slightly lower than at baseline and were even lower after drug discontinuation. Thus, in hypertrophic hypertensive patients, treatment with lisinopril improves the sympathovagal imbalance when normalization of the left ventricular mass is achieved. In patients without normalization of left ventricular mass, drug withdrawal is followed by worsening of cardiac neural control.",0,0

At baseline, clinical systolic/diastolic BP averaged 175/86 mm Hg, and 24-hour ambulatory and daytime BP averaged 148/80 and 154/85 mm Hg, respectively. After 13 months (median) of active treatment, clinical BP had decreased by 22.7/7.0 mm Hg and daytime and 24-hour BP by 10.5/4.5 and 9.7/4.3 mm Hg. , respectively (p < 0.001 for all). However, clinical (9.8/1.6 mm Hg), 24-hour (2.1/1.1 mm Hg), and daytime (2.9/1.0 mm Hg) BP also decreased during placebo (p < 0.05, except for daytime diastolic BP); these decreases accounted for 43%/23%, 20%/24%, and 30%/23% of the corresponding drop in BP during active treatment. After subtracting for placebo effects, net BP reductions during active treatment averaged only 12.9/5.4, 8.3/3.4, and 6.8/3.2 mm Hg for clinical BP, 24-hour and daytime, respectively. The effect of active treatment was also subject to diurnal variation (p < 0.05). Changes during placebo in mean systolic and diastolic BP per hour amounted to (median) 21% (range, -1% to 42%) and 25% (-3% to 72%), respectively, of the changes during active treatment. In conclusion, expressed in millimeters of mercury, the effect of antihypertensive treatment on BP is greater with the conventional measurement than with the ambulatory one. Regardless of whether BP is measured by conventional sphygmomanometry or ambulatory monitoring, a substantial proportion of the long-term BP changes observed during active treatment can be attributed to placebo effects. Therefore, ambulatory monitoring not corrected for placebo or control observations, such as conventional sphygmomanometry, overestimates BP responses in long-term clinical trials.",0,0

The infusion was continued for 5 days. 3. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were intensively monitored on admission to the intensive care unit (= reference values) and daily for the following 5 days. 4. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased significantly only in patients treated with enalaprilat, while heart rate (HR) remained unchanged in these patients. 5.

This study examines cough recorded in Prescription-Event Monitoring (PEM) for four ACE inhibitors. Special attention was paid to the study of enalapril because the drug was controlled before the causal relationship between cough and ACE inhibitors was widely accepted. RESULTS. Several factors that had obscured the causal relationship in the individual cases were also found to be a hindrance in the PEM. For example, cough was a common and non-serious event and was not reported in the enalapril PEM study and the rate was not significantly different from that reported for other medications. ACE inhibitor-induced cough has several features that reduce the possibility of a recognizable 'signal'. The original questionnaires returned by physicians in the enalapril PEM study have been re-examined. The observation that the cough rate decreased after stopping enalapril rather than increased after starting provided the best evidence of causality, because this was not affected by many biases, such as advertising that had occurred before the Physicians will participate in PEM and complete subsequent reports.",0,0

The objective of the present double-blind study was to evaluate the safety of the concomitant use of levosimendan and an ACE inhibitor drug.; The hemodynamic effects of levosimendan, administered with or without captopril, were evaluated using two-dimensional echocardiography, repeated blood pressure measurements, and ambulatory ECG recordings. Twenty-four male patients with stable NYHA II-III heart failure (EF < 40%) after prior myocardial infarction received, in random order, a single IV infusion of levosimendan or placebo. The infusions were repeated after 2 weeks of treatment with captopril up to 50 mg twice daily.

Baseline measurements for plasma renin activity (PRA), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR) were performed. Captopril (12.5 mg) was administered sublingually with dibasic potassium phosphate that maintained salivary pH at 7, or perorally with 100 mL of water. Further measurements of BP, HR, and venous blood samples were taken over a 3-hour period after drug administration. Blood samples were analyzed for levels of captopril and PRA.; The tmax after buffered sublingual administration of captopril, which ranged from 40 to 60 min (median = 40 min), was significantly shorter than after peroral administration (range 60-120 min, median = 90 min). Cmax was slightly higher after buffered sublingual than peroral administration, with mean values of 108.2 vs. 94.0 ng.ml-1. AUC values were similar after both routes of administration. The systolic and diastolic BP profiles over time for each administration method were significantly different, ie, sublingual administration produced earlier BP reduction, however, HR did not differ significantly between the two routes; Data indicate that this new method of captopril administration leads to an increased rate but unchanged degree of captopril absorption, suggesting a modest therapeutic advantage to the use of buffered sublingual captopril if a rapid reduction is required. of blood pressure.",0,0

Five patients (group I) who had developed ACE inhibitor-induced chronic cough were evaluated for bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) by methacholine inhalation challenge using a reservoir method at the Respiratory Unit of Chulalongkorn University Hospital. Five patients (group II) who did not experience ACEI-associated cough were also challenged as controls. The results revealed that two patients (40%) in group I demonstrated BHR with the mean PC20 at 15 mg/ml methacholine solution. On the other hand, none of the group II patients revealed BHR. We conclude that cough during ACE inhibitor therapy may be due to an increased inflammatory state in the airways in some susceptible subjects.",0,0

In the respiratory tract, ACE degrades substance P, so the mechanism of cough may be related to this peptide; Nine patients who developed cough and five patients who did not develop cough when taking the ACE inhibitor enalapril (2.5 or 5.0 mg/day) for hypertension were enrolled in the study. No subject had respiratory disease and respiratory function in all subjects was normal. One month after stopping enalapril, inhalation of hypertonic saline solution (4%) was performed using an ultrasonic nebulizer for 15-30 minutes to induce expectoration. The concentration of substance P in the sputum sample was measured by radioimmunoassay. In four of the nine cases with cough, enalapril was re-administered for 1-2 weeks and the concentration of substance P in the induced sputum was measured again; One month after stopping enalapril, the mean (SE) sputum substance P concentration of the cough group was 16.6 (3.0) fmol/mL, significantly higher than that of the cough-free subjects (0 0.9 (0.5) fmol/mL). ). All four subjects in the cough group who received a repeat dose of enalapril developed cough again, but substance P concentrations in induced sputum while taking enalapril (17.9 (3.2) fmol/mL) were similar to values while taking enalapril. They were taking enalapril. of enalapril (20.0 (2.5) fmol/ml); Mechanisms of ACE inhibitor-induced cough may involve substance P-mediated airway preparation.

TRACE study group.,,"KÃ¸ber, L; Torp-Pedersen, C; Ottesen, M; Burchardt, H; Korup, E; Lyngborg, K","The aim of this study was to assess the importance of congestive heart failure and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) on long-term mortality in different age groups. A total of 7,001 consecutive enzyme-confirmed MIs (6,676 patients) were screened for participation in the TRAndolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study. Medical history, echocardiographic estimation of LV systolic function determined as wall motion index, infarct complications, and survival were documented for all patients. To study the importance of congestive heart failure and wall motion index independent of age, we ran Cox proportional hazards models in 4 different age strata (< or = 55 years, 56 to 65 years, 66 to 75 years). years and > 75 years). Patients in these strata had 1-year mortality rates of 5%, 11%, 21%, and 32%, respectively. The three-year mortality rates were 11%, 20%, 34%, and 55%, respectively.

RCT. Body weight gain between dialysis in the cilazapril treatment period was significantly lower than in the non-treatment period. None of the other parameters, including blood pressure, plasma osmolarity, and serum Na and K concentration, were different in the treatment period versus the non-treatment period. The present data help explain the potential pharmacological action of AII on the physiology of thirst and suggest that cilazapril may effectively alleviate dialysis-associated hyperdipsia at least in some instances.

In two methodologically identical studies, antihypertensive effects were assessed by 24-hour ABPM and by office sitting diastolic (DBP) and systolic (SBP) blood pressure. After a 4- or 5-week placebo washout, 79 patients received randomized, double-blind treatment for 8 weeks with the combination dose of Fos/HCTZ 10/12.5 mg (n = 41) or placebo (n = 38). , and in the second study, 62 patients were treated with the Fos/HCTZ 20/12.5 mg dose combination (n = 30) or placebo (n = 32).

Relation to changes in skeletal muscle blood flow.,,"Andersson, P E; Lithell, H","In a previous open-label study of the metabolic effects of doxazosin in patients with essential hypertension, subgroup analysis indicated that subjects with an accumulation of risk factors for coronary heart disease (high VLDL triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose high) seemed to benefit more from the metabolic actions of doxazosin treatment. These results formed the basis of this double-blind, parallel-group study conducted to elucidate the metabolic effects of 6 months of treatment with doxazosin and enalapril in patients with essential hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia. Insulin sensitivity was measured with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp method. Hemodynamic evaluation included office and ambulatory blood pressure measurements and ultrasonic measurements of femoral artery blood flow. Both drugs significantly reduced both office BP and 24-h ambulatory BP. Office systolic BP was lowered significantly better with enalapril. Doxazosin, in contrast to enalapril, significantly increased insulin sensitivity (by 21%, p=0.02). It also reduced serum triglycerides (by 23%, P = 0.01), VLDL triglycerides (by 30%, P = 0.008), and VLDL cholesterol (by 24%, P = 0.02). This lipid-lowering effect of doxazosin was accompanied by an increase in both plasma lipoprotein lipase activity and the rate of clearance of an intravenous fat emulsion load. Neither treatment significantly increased femoral artery blood flow. It is speculated that without a measurable increase in blood flow in conducting vessels such as the femoral artery, doxazosin, by capillary recruitment, may prolong the transit time of blood over the muscle bed, which could explain the increased clearance of glucose and increased activity of lipoprotein lipase.",0,0

Will lowering LDL cholesterol in moderately hypercholesterolemic older people reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease and total mortality? These important questions of medical practice and public health will be addressed in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind trial in 40,000 high-risk hypertensive patients. ALLHAT is designed to determine whether the combined incidence of fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) and non-fatal myocardial infarction differs between people randomized to treatment with diuretics (chlorthalidone) and each of three alternative treatments: a calcium channel blocker ( amlodipine), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril), and an alpha-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin). ALLHAT also contains a randomized, open-label, lipid-lowering trial designed to determine whether lowering LDL cholesterol in 20,000 patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia (a subset of the 40,000) with a 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) inhibitor ) reductase, pravastatin, reduce all-cause mortality compared with a control group receiving 'usual care'. ALLHAT's main eligibility criteria are: 1) 55 years of age or older; 2) systolic or diastolic hypertension; and 3) one or more additional risk factors for heart attack (eg, evidence of atherosclerotic disease or type II diabetes). For the lipid-lowering trial, participants must have an LDL cholesterol of 120 to 189 mg/dL (100 to 129 mg/dL for those with known CHD) and a triglyceride level below 350 mg/dL. The median duration of treatment and follow-up is expected to be 6 years.

In essential hypertensive patients with dipyridamole echocardiography with stress test (DET) (DET+, n = 8) and without (DET-, n = 8) ST-segment depression greater than 0.1 mV during intravenous infusion of dipyridamole (0, 84 mg/kg for 10 min), studied changes in forearm blood flow (FBF, venous plethysmography, mL/100) induced by intrabrachial acetylcholine (Ach) (0.15, 0.45, 1.5, 4, 5, 15 micrograms/100 mL/min x 5 min each), an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, and by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (1, 2, 4 micrograms/100 mL/min x 5 min each), an smooth muscle cell relaxant. Forearm minimal vascular resistance (MFVR), an index of arteriolar structural changes, was also calculated. Both Ach and SNP caused greater vasodilation in DET- compared to DET+, while MFVRs were lower in DET- compared to DET+. After treatment, DET+ and DET- patients showed a significant and similar reduction in blood pressure and left ventricular mass index, whereas vasodilation to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside increased only in the DET+ group. In addition, forearm minimal vascular resistances were significantly reduced only in TED+ patients, who showed disappearance of dipyridamole-induced ischemic-type ST-segment depression. In conclusion, these data confirm that essential hypertensive patients with coronary microvascular disease are characterized by the presence of structural changes in the vascular bed of the forearm. Our results also indicate that cardiac and forearm vascular abnormalities can be reversed by antihypertensive treatment with an ACE inhibitor.",0,0

Primary efficacy parameters were change in trough systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as response to treatment in terms of hypertensive response categories; A gradual reduction in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure was observed in all treated patients from weeks 1 to 12 (10-29 mmHg for the losartan regimen and 14-32 mmHg for the enalapril regimen). At week 4, a substantial number of patients remained on monotherapy with the starting dose or double the dose of losartan (52%) or enalapril (72%). The blood pressure curves for each treatment were parallel in time. The enalapril-based regimen caused a statistically significantly greater reduction in blood pressure than the losartan-based regimen, although the mean differences in blood pressure response between the two treatment groups were small.

We have studied the influence of salt intake on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (creatinine clearance) in 14 patients with mild hypertension. Each patient was studied in random order and according to a crossover design, with usual salt intake, with high salt intake (ie usual +50/100 mmol/day) and with low salt intake (usual -50/100 mmol/day ). The intake of protein, calcium and potassium was fixed in the three study periods. The control group consisted of seven healthy subjects. High salt intake caused a significant (P < 0.01) increase in 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the expected suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone. Seven patients were classified as salt sensitive. GFR was significantly higher (P < 0.01) with high salt intake (125 +/- 10 ml/min) than with usual intake (113 +/- 7 ml/min) and with low salt intake (97 +/- 6ml/min). min). Overall, urinary salt excretion was significantly related to GFR (P < 0.01 by correlation analysis for repeated observations), and the slope of this relationship predicted that a 100-mmol/day increase in salt intake is associated with a 14.6 mL/min increase in GFR. The relationship between GFR and 24-h urine salt in salt-sensitive patients did not differ from that in salt-resistant patients. The GFR response to salt loading was largely independent of the renin-aldosterone system. No changes in blood pressure or GFR were observed in healthy subjects. With a fixed protein intake, changes in salt intake in the physiological range are associated with important variations in GFR in mild hypertensives. While hyperfiltration in mild hypertension is a predictor of impaired kidney function, high salt intake, regardless of the effect on blood pressure, could be a contributing factor to nephron obsolescence in patients with essential hypertension.",0,0

The effect of the two treatments on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) was also evaluated in a subset of patients. Management of diabetes with oral hypoglycemic agents, diet, and insulin alone or in combination was permitted. Median UAE fell with lisinopril from 65.5 (range 20-297) micrograms/min at baseline to 39.0 (2-510) micrograms/min after 12 months. With nifedipine, the median UAE fell from 63.0 (range 20-289) micrograms/min at baseline to 58.0 (9-1192) micrograms/min after 12 months. The estimated mean difference between the effects of the two treatments was 20 micrograms/min (P = 0.0006).

The Captopril Microalbuminuria Study Group.,,,"In insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), microalbuminuria predicts renal and cardiovascular disease. We present a pooled analysis of 235 normotensive patients with IDDM and microalbuminuria who participated in two 24-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials to assess the effects of captopril 50 mg twice daily on progression to overt clinical albuminuria. Of the 225 patients evaluable by intention to treat, 25 of 114 patients treated with placebo (21.9%) and 8 or 111 patients treated with captopril (7.2%) progressed to persistent clinical albuminuria. The risk of progression over 24 months was significantly reduced with captopril (p = 0.004) with a risk reduction of 69.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 31.7 to 86.1%). This degree of risk reduction remained at the same level (62.9% [16.1-83.6%], p = 0.017) after adjusting for time-varying mean arterial pressure differences. Albumin excretion rate increased by an average of 14.2% [3.1-26.5%] per year in the placebo group compared with a reduction of 9.6% [-18.6-0 .4%] per year in the group treated with captopril (p = 0.002). The rate of fall in creatinine clearance tended to be more rapid in the placebo-treated group than in the captopril-treated group (-6.4 [-10.2- -2.5] vs -1.4 [-5.3-2.6] ml.min-1.1 .73m -2, p = 0.07). Baseline albumin excretion rate (p < 0.0001) and glycosylated hemoglobin (p = 0.03) were independent predictors of progression to clinical albuminuria and changes in mean arterial pressure (p = 0.02) and serum cholesterol level (p = 0.003) were significantly associated with percentage changes in albumin excretion rate.

The initial evaluation of insulin sensitivity was followed by random assignment of each patient to treatment with captopril or placebo, according to a double-blind crossover design. The euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies were then repeated for all patients after placebo and captopril treatments. Plasma levels of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) were evaluated before, during, and after each clamp; The resulting data showed that plasma catecholamine levels increased during the initial euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (NE: +23.6% time 0 vs. time 120 min, P < 0.05; E: +24.8% time 0 vs. time 120 min, P < 0.05).

In 66 hypertensive patients (conventionally measured diastolic pressure > 95 mmHg), ambulatory blood pressure was measured with placebo at baseline and 2 months later, while the patients were taking lisinopril 10 mg once daily between 7 pm and 4 pm. 11 pm Effect of daytime treatment curves were obtained by subtracting blood pressure at baseline from the value corresponding to 2 months for all time intervals considered in the analysis. To calculate the surface area ratio, the area under the treatment effect curve was divided by the product of the peak blood pressure lowering effect and the dosing interval (24 h). The reproducibility of the trough-to-peak and surface ratios was investigated using the Bland and Altman techniques. At 2 months, lisinopril reduced (+/- standard deviation) 24-h pressure by 13 +/- 16 mmHg systolic and 8 +/- 8 mmHg diastolic (p < 0.001). Consistent with the usual approach, without accounting for interindividual variability, the trough-to-peak ratio was 0.7 for systolic and diastolic pressure. When the curves of the effects of daytime treatment were investigated in individual patients with a resolution of 1 h, the median minimum-maximum ratio was 0.30 for systolic pressure (5th-95th percentile interval [PI]: -0 0.51, 0.82) and 0.28 for diastolic pressure (PI: -0.37, 0.78); corresponding values for the area ratio were 0.33 (PI: 0.03, 0.58) and 0.30 (PI: -0.01, 0.55). Similarly, trough-to-peak ratios and surface ratios increased when individual blood pressure profiles were progressively smoothed by replacing 1-h averages with 2-h moving averages, 2-h averages, 3-h moving averages. ho averages 3 h. . The distributions of trough-to-peak ratios and surface ratios were abnormal in 37 of 40 cases (p < 0.001, Shapiro-Wilk test). Consistency was greater (p < 0.001) for surface than for trough-to-peak ratios. The within-subject reproducibility of the surface ratios tended to be higher than that of the corresponding trough-to-peak ratios.

Renal hemodynamic measurements included effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by radionuclide study using 131I-hippuran and 99mTc, according to the methods described by Schlegel and Gates, respectively. Effective renal blood flow [ERBF = ERPF/(1-Ht)], filtration fraction (FF = GFR/ERPF), and renal vascular resistance (RVR = MBP x 80/ERBF) were calculated. At the end of the administration of cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide, significant decreases (p < 0.001) in SBP, DBP and MAP were observed compared to baseline values. A significant decrease (p < 0.001) in RVR and FF and a significant increase (p < 0.001) in ERPF and ERBF were also found in the cilazapril group. A significant decrease (p < 0.001) in RVR was found in the hydrochlorothiazide group. No major side effects were seen with any of the treatments.

However, limited data are available on the effects of ACE inhibitors on the onset and progression of CHF in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The present study was conducted as a substudy of the long-term Survival of Myocardial Infarction evaluation trial and involved 1146 patients with anterior wall AMI who did not undergo thrombolysis with the exclusion of patients with a history or clinical signs of CHF on admission. . Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with zofenopril (7.5 to 30 mg twice daily) or placebo for a cumulative 6-week period. The prevalence of CHF, whether mild to moderate or severe, has been the main objective and has been evaluated 6 weeks and 1 year after AMI. Zofenopril did not reduce the overall prevalence of CHF after 6 weeks and 12 months. In contrast, the prevalence of severe CHF (1.6% vs. 2.6%: 55.5% risk reduction; 95% confidence interval 9 to 63; p = 0.0325) and the occurrence The combined risk of death or major CHF (4.8% vs 8.2%: 59% risk reduction; 95% confidence interval 11 to 71; P = 0.024) was reduced after 6 weeks of treatment with zofenopril. Additionally, the percentage of patients who deteriorated to severe CHF after 1 year was significantly reduced with zofenopril (11.0% vs. 24.3%; p = 0.001).

In addition, their fitness status was estimated by the Conconi cycle ergometer test before and after administration of perindopril or placebo. The SI was low in our study population (3.2 vs. 13.3 10(-4) ml.microU-1.min-1 in normal lean control subjects). It did not differ between the perindopril and placebo groups after the placebo run-in period (3.1 vs. 3.3 x 10(-4) ml.microU-1.min-1) and was not influenced by perindopril ( 3.3 x 10(-4) treatment with ml.microU-1.min-1) or placebo (3.6 x 10(-4) ml.microU-1.min-1). In addition, no significant changes in fasting plasma insulin and glucose, areas under the glucose and insulin curves, glucose disappearance rates, total serum triglycerides (TG), or cholesterol or lipoprotein cholesterol fractions were observed between run-in and active treatment phases in the perindopril or placebo group, respectively. Heart rate (HR), body weight, and anaerobic threshold remained stable in both groups. Compliance, assessed by pill count, was >90% in both groups at all visits. Therefore, the ACE inhibitor perindopril is neutral with respect to insulin sensitivity, plasma insulin and glucose, and lipoprotein metabolism in overweight, non-diabetic patients with essential hypertension.",0,0

Insulin sensitivity (by Bergman's minimal model method), additional metabolic variables, clinical blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure profile, and renal indices were assessed at the end of the placebo and active treatment phases; Compared with placebo, the two therapies produced similar reductions in supine clinic mean blood pressure [10 +/- 3 vs. 11 +/- 3% (means +/- SEM)], blood pressure in clinic in upright position (10 +/- 4 vs. 11 +/- 4%) and ambulatory daytime blood pressure (9 +/- 2 vs. 12 +/- 3%). However, although the verapamil-trandolapril combination was found to be metabolically neutral, the atenolol-chlorthalidone combination aggravated insulin resistance [insulin sensitivity index, from (0.8 +/- 0.2) to (0.3 +/- - 0.1) x 10(-4) /min per U per ml], increased serum triglyceride level and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and plasma potassium levels. Although both therapies tended to reduce 24-h albuminuria, this was significant only for verapamil-trandolapril treatment; Because the effect of any antihypertensive drug, including diuretics and beta-blockers, on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients is unknown, rational treatment selection can currently be based only on surrogate endpoints.

SOLVD researchers.,,"Benedict, C R; Shelton, B; Johnstone, D E; Francis, G; Greenberg, B; Konstam, M; Probstfield, J L; Yusuf, S","Elevated plasma neurohormonal levels are associated with higher mortality rates in patients with symptomatic heart failure. A previous Study of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) trial suggested that neurohumoral activation precedes symptom development, as evidenced by increased neurohormonal levels in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. However, the importance of this early neurohumoral activation is unclear. The objectives of this study were to determine the prognostic significance of plasma norepinephrine (PNE) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations and plasma renin activity (PRA) in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.; PNE and PRA were measured prior to randomization in 514 patients with left ventricular ejection fractions < or = 35% who did not require treatment for congestive heart failure and were enrolled in the SOLVD prevention trial. Plasma ANP levels were measured in a subset of 241 patients due to study design. Using the Cox proportional hazards model that included left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association functional class, age, gender, treatment assignment to placebo or enalapril, and cause of heart failure, we examined whether these neurohormones predicted all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, development of heart failure, or development of ischemic events (myocardial infarction or unstable angina). PNE was the strongest predictor of clinical events in this patient population. PNE levels above the median of 393 pg/mL were associated with a relative risk of 2.59 (P = 0.002) for all-cause mortality, 2.55 (P = 0.003) for cardiovascular mortality, 2.55 (P = 0.005) for hospitalization for HF, 1.88 (P = 0.002) for development of HF, 1.92 (P = 0.001) for ischemic events, and 2.59 (P = 0.005) for myocardial infarction. PNE remained the most powerful predictor of all-cause mortality and ischemic events when the analysis included only patients with a history of ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. Increases in other neurohormonal levels were not helpful in predicting the later development of clinical events; Elevated PNE levels in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction seem to predict cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and the development of clinical events related to the onset of heart failure or acute ischemic syndromes. Therefore, measurement of PNE may be a potential early marker for the assessment of disease progression in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, and modulation of the release or effect of PNE may lead to better prognosis and /or a reduction in morbidity.",0,0

Microalbuminuria has been pointed out as a possible predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of this trial was to assess the effect of quinapril, an ACE inhibitor with high tissue affinity for the enzyme, on AER in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and no evidence of diabetes mellitus. In this 12-week, 24-center study, 213 patients were administered quinapril and titrated to 10, 20, or 40 mg/day alone or 20 mg/day plus 12.5 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide.

Differential solute clearances were used to assess glomerular function, before and after treatment. CsA reduced median proteinuria by 56%, from 7.3 to 3.2 g/24 h (p < 0.0001). The corresponding mean increases in serum albumin, immunoglobulin G, and oncotic pressure values were 31%, 32%, and 26%, respectively (all P < 0.0001). Blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow remained constant, but CsA reset the dextran sieving curve toward normal, reducing the calculated fraction of shunt-type pores by 25% (P < 0). .05). In 14 cases, a crossover design was used to randomly assign patients to 3 months of CsA versus 3 months of enalapril (10 to 30 mg daily), separated by a 1-month washout interval. Although enalapril reduced blood pressure by 8 mm Hg (P < 0.01), it had no effect on proteinuria, plasma protein composition, filtration dynamics, or dextran screening (all P = not significant). CsA dependence of proteinuria, indicated by recurrent nephrosis after CsA withdrawal, required additional courses of CsA to maintain subnephrotic proteinuria in most patients. In six patients with decreased GFR during prolonged CsA treatment, a repeat biopsy showed more prominent immune deposits and a thicker glomerular basement membrane than at baseline. It was concluded that: (1) CsA reduces proteinuria in MN in part by improving barrier size selectivity; (2) the lack of comparable efficacy of enalapril suggests that the antiproteinuric effect of CsA is related to its immunosuppressive rather than glomerulosuppressive properties; but (3) as judged by repeat biopsy, CsA does not prevent continued autoantibody formation in this disorder.",0,0
1938,8785466,ACE inhibitors in elderly patients with hypertension. Special Considerations.,,"Ravid, M; Ravid, D","Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have emerged as the class of antihypertensive agents and vasodilators of first choice in the treatment of elderly patients with hypertension. Normotensive patients with congestive heart failure, post-myocardial infarction, or diabetes mellitus with evidence of microangiopathy will also benefit from continued ACE inhibition. Long-term use of ACE inhibitors is associated with better survival and reduced cardiovascular, cerebral, and renal morbidity in these patients. In elderly atherosclerotic patients, these agents provide good control of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and peripheral resistance, with marked preservation of vital organ perfusion and infrequent adverse effects. Used as monotherapy, the efficacy of ACE inhibitors is limited. However, its combined use with other drugs has advantages, particularly thiazide diuretics, nitrates, and calcium antagonists. In this way, renal function is preserved and hypertrophy of the left heart is prevented. There are no major differences between the various ACE inhibitors and the choice of drug is largely a matter of personal preference.",0,0
1939,8785469,The changing face of hypertension and antihypertensive agents.,,"Kitler, M E","In short, much remains to be done to encourage thinking, both by patients and health care providers, in terms of the risks of disease and the benefits of health care, including those of pharmaceutical options. Health professionals have been relatively ineffective patient educators, perhaps because the old paternalism of 'doctor knows best' still exists. Furthermore, not enough attention has been paid to improving the communication skills of health professionals. Most likely, one reason is the pressure to control costs that limits the time healthcare professionals spend consulting with patients. Less than ideal compliance has even been reported in large-scale trials. For example, in the SHEP trial, 90% compliance was reported (perhaps due to patient selection), but in the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), only 80% compliance was achieved. Poor adherence to long-term treatment, both lifestyle modifications and drug therapy, has been identified as the main reason for inadequate control of elevated BP; some sources claim that only 25% of all hypertensive patients have controlled BP. Therefore, planned patient education efforts should be undertaken as they can significantly improve BP control and decrease hypertension-related morbidity and mortality. To achieve this, the patient must become an active participant in the planned regimen and not remain a passive recipient (Table III).",0,0

Eleven of 24 patients completed a 6-month treatment period with captopril monotherapy (50 mg twice daily). The hemodynamic and hormonal response produced by a final dose of 50 mg captopril was determined again in the 11 subjects who maintained blood pressure control with captopril monotherapy for 6 months; The drop in blood pressure produced 3 h after drug intake was comparable for the first and last 50-mg doses of captopril. Although the first response to captopril increased plasma levels of Ang I only, the response to the last dose of the drug (6 months later) caused significantly higher levels of Ang I and Ang-(1-7). Neither acute nor chronic captopril therapy had a significant effect on plasma Ang II concentrations. Although plasma levels of prostaglandin E2 and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha did not change with a first exposure to captopril, concentrations of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha but not prostaglandin E2 increased significantly in subjects treated with the inhibitor for 6 months. A negative correlation between diastolic blood pressure and plasma Ang-(1-7) levels was also demonstrated in the 11 essential hypertensive subjects in whom blood pressure was controlled with captopril monotherapy; Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with captopril had a significant effect on blood pressure that was not directly explained by a suppression of plasma Ang II levels. Continuous captopril therapy unmasked a contribution of Ang-(1-7) and prostacyclin to the antihypertensive actions of this drug.",0,0

In an open-label prospective trial, we evaluated 14 patients with previously untreated hypertension (163 +/- 2/104 +/- 2 mm Hg) and an echocardiographically determined left ventricular mass index of 141.6 +/- 5.2 g /m2, indicating hypertrophy. We obtained a gluteal skin biopsy sample before starting treatment to investigate the morphology and function of the small subcutaneous arteries (approximately 200 to 400 microns in diameter). Subsequently, the patients received antihypertensive treatment with a combination of spirapril (3 or 6 mg) and isradipine (2.5 or 5 mg). Echocardiographic recordings were made after 6 months and 1 year, and a final biopsy was taken after 1 year. After 1 year, blood pressure was significantly reduced to 142 +/- 3/90 +/- 1 mm Hg (P < 0.001) and left ventricular mass index was significantly decreased to 105.3 +/- 5.8 g /m2 (P < 0.001). 001).

1944,8794833,Lisinopril reverses left ventricular hypertrophy through improved aortic compliance.,,"Shimamoto, H; Shimamoto, Y","We treated 38 essential hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy with nifedipine or lisinopril. The study had a single-blind crossover design; nifedipine or lisinopril was given for the first 24 weeks, and then patients were crossed over to the other antihypertensive agent for another 24 weeks. Both nifedipine and lisinopril significantly lowered mean arterial pressure to the same extent. Although lisinopril decreased left ventricular mass index more rapidly than nifedipine, 48 weeks of antihypertensive treatment with nifedipine or lisinopril reduced the extent of left ventricular hypertrophy to the same level. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy may be due primarily to a reduction in mean arterial pressure during 24-week nifedipine treatment and an improvement in aortic compliance during lisinopril treatment. Both nifedipine and lisinopril are effective in reversing hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy; however, the agents have disparate actions on hemodynamic factors.",0,0

After discontinuing all prior antihypertensive medication, patients entered a 4- to 6-week placebo run-in period, followed by 24 weeks of randomized treatment with the active compounds administered in a double-dummy technique. The dose of fosinopril was 20 mg, which could be increased to 40 mg at 8 weeks (mean 25.6 mg); that of enalapril was 10 mg, which could be increased to 20 mg at 8 weeks (mean 12.9 mg). Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg could be added at 16 weeks and was administered to 27% of patients in the fosinopril group and 30% of those in the enalapril group. All drugs were administered once daily. Supine systolic BP (SAP) decreased from 157 to 143 mm Hg in the fosinopril group (p < 0.01), and from 159 to 147 mm Hg in the enalapril group (p < 0.01). SSDP decreased from 100 to 89 mm Hg in the fosinopril group (p < 0.01) and from 100 to 92 mm Hg in the enalapril group (p < 0.01).

The number of reported AEs was not statistically different in the two groups. ACE inhibition was evaluated in a subgroup of patients (n = 26, 13 in each group). Fosinopril caused greater ACE inhibition at the doses used in the present study, which was statistically significant. Both fosinopril and enalapril caused statistically significant reductions in BP of similar magnitude, and both agents were well tolerated.

1947,8800625,benefit-risk assessment of ACE inhibitor therapy after myocardial infarction.,,"Borghi, C; Ambrosioni, E","The use of ACE inhibitors in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) has been the subject of several studies in recent years. These studies have demonstrated the ability of these agents to improve both survival and morbidity in patients with myocardial infarction. However, the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with myocardial infarction has been shown to reduce blood pressure (BP) and thus could endanger the ischemic myocardium. All studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with MI have shown a significant reduction in systemic BP, but no relationship has been found between the development of hypotension and worse clinical outcome. An increased risk of death has been observed exclusively in association with sudden and severe hypotension, the occurrence of which can be largely prevented by administration of the ACE inhibitor according to an escalating dose titration schedule. In contrast, some degree of long-term BP reduction might have some beneficial effect in MI patients and contribute to the lower incidence of reinfarction observed in patients with acute MI receiving long-term captopril therapy. Since the renin-angiotensin system is strictly related to renal function, its blockade by an ACE inhibitor could cause some degree of renal dysfunction, particularly in patients with myocardial infarction and impaired ventricular function. Available results from large-scale studies suggest that renal function abnormalities (i.e., increased serum creatinine) are observed in 0.9 to 2.4% of patients with myocardial infarction who, however, experience some benefit from treatment with ACE inhibitors. Interestingly, the administration of ACE inhibitors does not seem to further compromise severely impaired renal function and may also represent a useful tool for the treatment of patients with renal dysfunction associated with MI. The use of ACE inhibitors in patients with MI is associated with a satisfactory clinical and laboratory safety profile. The occurrence of significant adverse effects appears to be very low and mainly attributable to a fairly modest prevalence of cough (2.4 to 6.8%). Treatment discontinuation due to biochemical and hematological abnormalities has been observed in less than 1% of treated patients. Therefore, the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitor treatment appear to outweigh safety concerns, reinforcing the role of ACE inhibition as an appropriate therapeutic strategy in the treatment of patients with myocardial infarction.",0,0

In the first part of the study, Group II patients received a reverse sequence of drugs (before Ticlopidine 250 mg bid and then Captopril 50 bid). In both groups of patients, C induced a significant decrease in blood pressure and an increase in PFWD, TWD, and WI. T did not change blood pressure but slightly increased PFWD, TWD, and WI. The improvement was more apparent during C plus T administration, while placebo administration induced a trend toward baseline. Finally, the chronic administration of C plus T for twelve months induced an additional improvement of all the parameters considered.

Since 1985, 50 phase III-IV trials have been conducted to investigate antihypertensive efficacy in patients with hypertension; 32 were comparator-controlled trials and 18 were open-label studies of lacidipine treatment; In total, 16,590 patients received lacidipine; 13,419 in open-label studies and 3,171 in double-blind comparative trials. In total, these patients contributed 5,124 person-years (py). In addition, active comparator treatment was administered to 1810 patients and placebo to 451; Fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events have been estimated. Efficacy (change in blood pressure and heart rate), adverse event rates, and dropout rates were compared for the different treatment regimens. The reasons for dropping out of studies have also been compared. Adverse effects were also analyzed in terms of their time of appearance and duration; Blood pressure was lowered with lacidipine 2-6 mg; in controlled trials from 166/102 to 144/85 mmHg. Heart rate dropped from 75.6 to 74.1 beats per minute. The estimated event rate for a possible myocardial infarction in all studies was 5.46 per 1000 years. The rate of fatal events (all causes) was 5.27 per 1,000 years and the estimated rate of fatal cardiovascular events was 2.93 per 1,000 years. In a long-term study (48 weeks) comprising 2,282 patients (1,658 pa), the observed fatal event rate (all causes) was 4.2 per 1,000 pa. The overall incidence in comparative studies of (one or more ) adverse events were: for lacidipine 30.3%, other calcium antagonist events 43.8%, diuretics 18.7%, beta receptor blockers 48.7%, ACE inhibitors 10.4% and placebo 15, 7%. Adverse effects of lacidipine were as expected, for example, headache, hot flushes, foot edema and palpitations.; Analyzing archival data for lacidipine and some comparator drugs in nearly 19,000 hypertensive patients, we found that lacidipine is an effective and well-tolerated drug with a reasonable adverse profile typical of a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist. Our study has the obvious limitations of a retrospective analysis of data obtained from a large cohort of patients, most of whom received lacidipine for a relatively short period of time. The current results indicate a lower fatal event rate than previously reported in actively treated hypertensives in the Collins meta-analyses, comprising ten times more person-years than our analysis.

Two hundred and five drugs were associated with hepatic reactions. The top 20 drugs accounted for 57% of all liver reactions. Fifty-seven percent were reported in women. Hepatotoxicity was reported more frequently in patients aged 50 to 80 years. Liver reactions were associated with a mortality of 3.3%, but were responsible for 7.4% of all fatal cases. There was a steady increase in the number of reports over the 21 years. Although the highest number of reports of liver damage were received between 1988 and 1994, mortality was lowest during this period. There were substantial differences in medications associated with liver reactions during each of the three periods, although erythromycin was the most common cause at all times. Erythromycin was associated with two deaths. Halothane and perhexylene were the most frequent cause of death and were two of the most important causes of liver damage during the first and second periods.

Ambulatory blood pressure and treatment of hypertension.,,"Bieniaszewski, L; Staessen, J A; Polfliet, J; Thijs, L; Fagard, R","The main objective of the Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Treatment of Hypertension (APTH) trial is to test the hypothesis that antihypertensive treatment based on ambulatory monitoring may be more beneficial than treatment guided by conventional sphygmomanometry. After a 2-month single-blind placebo run-in period, hypertensive patients were randomized into two groups, one in which the target pressure was a sitting diastolic pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg on conventional sphygmomanometry (blood pressure conventional [CBP] group) and another in which a daytime diastolic pressure (from 10 to 20 h) of 80 to 89 mmHg had to be achieved (ambulatory blood pressure [ABP] group). After randomization, all patients were started on lisinopril 10 mg/day. One month later, lisinopril could be continued at 10 or 20 mg/day or suspended depending on the blood pressure reached. This article is an interim report on 207 patients followed for two months in the trial. At one month, lisinopril was discontinued more frequently in the ABP group than in the CBP group (24 vs 9 patients, p = 0.004). However, at two months, blood pressure control was not significantly different in the two treatment groups. Baseline-adjusted differences in systolic pressure between the two trial treatment arms (ABP-CBP group) were +2.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI]): -2.9, + 8.3) for conventional pressure, +0.4 mm Hg (CI: -4.3, +5.1) for 24-h pressure, -0.1 mm Hg (CI: -5.1, + 4.8) for daytime pressure and -0.7 mm Hg (CI: -6.7, +5.4) for nighttime pressure.

The aim of the study was to assess the effects of sublingual nifedipine 10 mg (n = 15) or captopril 25 mg (n = 13) on HRV in consecutive patients admitted to hospital for severe hypertension. HRV was calculated online from 300 cardiac cycles before and 60-90 min after drug administration. At baseline, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was >190 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >110 mm Hg. Both agents caused a similar reduction in blood pressure (BP). Nifedipine reduced the variance (-63 +/- 6%; P < 0.0001) and the high-frequency (HF) component (-72 +/- 8%; P < 0.0001), and increased the LF ratio /HF (+870 +/- 336%; P < 0.02) and heart rate (+14 +/- 3%; P < 0.0001). Captopril exerted different effects: variance and HF component increased by +176 +/- 55%; (P < 0.007) and +126 +/- 44% (P < 0.015), respectively. The LF/HF ratio (low/high frequency) decreased (-44 +/- 19%; P < 0.04) along with heart rate (-4 +/- 1%; < 0.009). It is concluded that captopril, unlike nifedipine, increases HRV and decreases the LF/HF ratio and is therefore a better option in hypertensive patients who may be prone to dangerous arrhythmias.",0,0

Assessment by spectral analysis and hemodynamic measurements.,,"Veerman, D P; Douma, C E; Jacobs, M C; Thien, T; Van Montfrans, G A","1. The effects of a first dose and chronic treatment with spirapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on short-term fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate were evaluated by rapid spectral analysis of Fourier. Effects on systemic hemodynamics in the supine and standing position were also studied. We treated 11 patients with 3 mg and 13 patients with 12 mg of spirapril for 8 weeks. 2. Spirapril did not change the overall variability of blood pressure. Using spectral analysis, changes in blood pressure and heart rate variability in various frequency bands can be evaluated, which may be related to changes in the activity of the autonomic nervous system. Relative potency in the mid-frequency band (0.08-0.12 Hz) of supine systolic pressure was 23 +/- 10% during placebo treatment and decreased during treatment with 12 mg to 11 + /- 4% (P < 0.01 vs. placebo, first dose) and 13 +/- 6% (P < 0.01, chronic treatment). Mean standing systolic heart rate power was 38 +/- 12% during placebo and decreased to 27 +/- 9% (P < 0.01 vs. placebo) after the first 12-mg dose, but did not decrease after chronic treatment (29 +/- 13%). Treatment with 3 mg did not induce changes in mean-frequency blood pressure variability. A decrease in mid-frequency band power may indicate a decrease in sympathetic vascular drive. Power in the high-frequency band (0.15-0.40 Hz) of heart rate did not change after treatment, suggesting no change in cardiac vagal output. 3. Supine blood pressure was decreased by a decrease in vascular resistance by 16 +/- 23% (3 mg) and 14 +/- 19% (12 mg) after 8 weeks of treatment. Heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output did not change. Orthostatic hypotension did not occur after the first dose. In the 12 mg group, the orthostatic (compared to supine) induced heart rate increase increased from +9 +/- 5 beats min-1 (placebo) to +14 +/- 4 beats min-1 ( P < 0.05) after the first dose There was no change in orthostatic heart rate increase in the 3 mg group. Orthostatic changes in stroke volume, cardiac output, and vascular resistance were not influenced by spirapril. 4. In conclusion, the decrease in mean-frequency arterial pressure variability may suggest an inhibitory effect of acute and chronic ACE inhibition on sympathetic vasomotor control. Vagal activity was not influenced as high-frequency heart rate variability did not change. Acute and chronic ACE inhibition did not reduce important cardiovascular reflexes, as the hemodynamic response to orthostasis remained intact.",0,0

1958,8828013,Adverse metabolic effects of antihypertensive drugs. Implications for treatment.,,"Preuss, H G; Burris, J F","Adverse metabolic effects have been associated with drugs used in the treatment of hypertension, especially diuretics and beta-blockers. These effects include disturbances in electrolytes, glucose/insulin, lipids, and uric acid. This may explain, at least in part, why early trials examining the impact of antihypertensive drug therapy with diuretics and beta-blockers showed beneficial effects on coronary artery disease that were disappointingly short of the expected effect. Among therapeutic agents, diuretics cause disturbances in electrolyte homeostasis, eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyponatremia. In contrast, ACE inhibitors cause hyperkalaemia under certain circumstances. Both diuretics and beta-blockers, especially non-selective beta-blockers that lack intrinsic sympathomimetic abilities, have been associated with alterations in glucose/insulin metabolism and may cause deleterious alterations in the circulating plasma lipid profile. Hyperuricemia, associated with the use of diuretics, appears to be a problem only in those patients who are predisposed to high circulating levels of uric acid.",0,0

This is true both in terms of its fundamental mode of action at the cellular level and in the patient in the clinical setting. New pharmaceutical compounds, such as renin inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and aldosterone antagonists, provide new insights not only into the importance of the different components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in heart failure but also on the mode of action of the angiotensin converting enzyme. inhibitors This manuscript also provides a brief update on the organization of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and other pathways of angiotensin-II formation with particular relevance to heart failure. Data on the potential relevance of genetic polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are discussed. Possibly the single most important observation in clinical cardiovascular medicine in 1995 was the report of a highly significant interaction between ACE inhibitors and aspirin on mortality in patients with ventricular dysfunction with or without heart failure. This has called into question the safety of aspirin use in heart failure.",0,0

1962,8841011,Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition after acute myocardial infarction with special reference to the Fourth International Infarction Survival Study (ISIS-4).,,"Syed, M; Borzak, S; Jafri, S M","The role of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of asymptomatic or symptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is well established. More recently, large clinical trials have evaluated the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors shortly after AMI, that is, within 24 hours of symptom onset. This concept has emerged with the understanding of the pathophysiological changes that occur after AMI. Neurohormonal activation and ventricular remodeling after AMI underlie these changes, while the degree of LV dysfunction remains a strong predictor of poor outcome. Large clinical trials with mortality endpoints have shown modest benefit from early use of ACE inhibitors in an unselected population. However, the widespread use of ACE inhibitors remains controversial due to little overall benefit. We review the pathophysiologic changes that occur after AMI, the rationale for early use of ACE inhibitors, and available data from large clinical trials. We recommend considering early use of an ACE inhibitor in all but the lowest risk patients. Clinical features of such a low-risk population would include small, non-anterior infarcts in patients younger than 65 years and with LV ejection fractions greater than 50%. Objective assessment of LV function during hospitalization for AMI is warranted to appropriately select patients for ACE inhibitor therapy. Dosing should be started carefully to avoid hypotension and should be adjusted to target doses used in large trials. The duration of therapy in patients at high risk of death or ventricular enlargement should be indefinite. Further large-scale secondary prevention trials with long-term treatment are underway to assess the effect of ACE inhibition on progression of coronary heart disease and reinfarction.",0,0

Thirty NIDD hypertensive patients (age = 50 +/- 3 years; BMI = 30 +/- 1 kg/m2) (mean +/- SEM) were studied before and after a 12-week period of antihypertensive treatment. Ten patients were treated with doxazosin (Cardura) (2 to 8 mg once daily or 8 mg twice daily), 9 with captopril (Capoten) (25 to 50 mg twice daily), and 11 with nifedipine (Procardia- XL) (30 to 60 mg twice daily). once a day). Blood pressure, creatinine clearance, 24-hour urinary protein excretion, fasting plasma glucose concentration, and glycosylated hemoglobin were measured before and after drug treatment. Fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were similar in all three groups before initiation of antihypertensive therapy and did not change significantly from baseline in any treatment group. In the doxazosin group, creatinine clearance increased from 99 +/- 8 to 122 +/- 8 mL/1.73 m2.min (p < 0.01), while 24-hour urinary protein excretion decreased from 2.66 +/- 0.05 to 1.76 +/- 0.02 mg/day/ml/1.73 m2.min (p < 0.01). In diabetics treated with captopril, creatinine clearance increased from 93 +/- 6 to 109 +/- 9 ml/1.73 m2.min (p < 0.05), while protein excretion in 24-hour urine decreased from 2.70 +/- 0.05 to 2.03 +/- 0.04 mg/day/ml/1.73 m2.min (p < 0.05). In patients treated with nifedipine, creatinine clearance did not change (97 +/- 6 vs. 94 +/- 7 ml/1.73 m2.min), while 24-hour urinary protein excretion decreased from 2 .84 +/- 0.04 to 1.95 +/- 0.03 mg/day/ml/1.73 m2.min. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were similar with doxazosin (150 +/- 3/95 +/- 2 mm Hg), captopril (153 +/- 3/93 +/- 1), and nifedipine (155 +/- 4/93 +/- 1) groups before the start of antihypertensive therapy and decreased to 143 +/- 3/84 +/- 3 (doxazosin), 139 +/- 3/82 +/- 3 (captopril), and 141 +/- 3/84 +/- 1 (nifedipine) mm Hg (all p < 0.01 vs pretreatment). In summary, both doxazosin and captopril treatment were associated with significant increases in GFR, whereas all three antihypertensive agents caused a significant decrease in proteinuria. These results indicate that alpha-adrenergic blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers can be used safely and effectively in the clinical treatment of diabetic patients with non-insulin-dependent hypertension.",0,0
1965,8852521,Medications during pregnancy: a matter of risk classification and information to prescribers.,,"Sannerstedt, R; Lundborg, P; Danielsson, B R; KihlstrÃ¶m, I; AlvÃ¡n, G; Prame, B; Ridley, E","The Swedish system for fetal risk classification of drugs was the first of its kind and was implemented in 1978. Drugs for use in pregnant women are classified into 4 general categories: A through D. The Food and Drug Administration The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduced a system in 1979 that also used the letters A through D, along with a category X. However, the definitions differ considerably between the FDA system and the Swedish system, giving resulting in a very different allocation of drugs to the respective categories. In the Swedish system, category A includes drugs that have been widely used and/or for which there are reliable clinical data indicating that there is no evidence of alteration of the reproductive process. Category B includes drugs for which data from pregnant women are insufficient to make a robust estimate of human teratogenic risk, and therefore the classification is based on animal data, with assignment to 3 subgroups. For category C products, the pharmacological action of the drug may have undesirable effects on the human fetus or newborn. Finally, category D contains drugs for which human data indicate a higher incidence of malformations. The categorization statement is always followed by a short explanatory text. In contrast to the FDA system, the Swedish system has been well accepted, judging by an interview study that included 934 doctors and pharmacists. We believe that much of the US dissatisfaction may be due to deficiencies in the category definitions of the FDA system. The FDA system requires unrealistically high data quality, for example, the availability of controlled studies in pregnant women that fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus are necessary for a drug to be assigned category A. Consequently, the Most drugs on the US market are assigned to category C, interpreted as ""risk cannot be ruled out."" The distribution of drugs in the various categories is therefore very different between the Swedish and FDA systems. We believe that the topic of this debate reflects a fundamental problem related to public health information: how should a large, complex, changing and difficult to evaluate data bank be organized before it is available to professionals and secondly to legos?",0,0
1966,8857071,Lisinopril reduces post-exercise albuminuria more effectively than atenolol in primary hypertension.,,"Rangemark, C; Lind, H; Lindholm, L; Hedner, T; Samuelsson, O","Physical exercise causes transient albuminuria. The mechanisms of post-exercise albuminuria are not fully understood, but stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) probably plays an important role through intrarenal hemodynamic changes leading to elevated filtration pressure. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we compared the effects on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) of treatment with lisinopril (L) and atenolol (A), that is, our aim was to investigate whether RAS inhibition or inhibition of beta1-adrenoceptor-mediated sympathetic nervous system effects differed with respect to changes in UAEs. Sixteen patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension were studied. Four standardized cycle ergometer exercise tests were performed before and after each active treatment period. UAEs 30 min after exercise, determined by radioimmunoassay, were significantly reduced with both treatments: -278 µg center point min-1 (L) and –199 µg center point min-1 (A). The reduction in post-exercise UAE achieved by treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (L) was significantly greater than that achieved by treatment with selective beta1-adrenoceptor blockers. Both drugs equally reduced blood pressure (BP) at rest and during exercise. In conclusion, this study showed that antihypertensive treatment with an ACE inhibitor was more effective in reducing exercise-induced albuminuria than a selective beta1-adrenoceptor blocking agent with a similar degree of BP lowering in patients with nonhypertensive primary hypertension. complicated. This suggests that the RAS plays an important role in post-exercise albuminuria in hypertensive subjects. However, the clinical significance of this finding remains to be clarified.",0,0

One hundred thirty-five patients (112 completers) in NYHA class II-III, on digitalis and diuretics, were randomized after a 2-week placebo run-in to receive either placebo or CLZ 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg or 2.5 mg daily for 12 weeks, followed by a 2-week placebo washout. Hemodynamic studies, including stress tests before and 3 h after medication, were performed on the first and last days of treatment. Measurements were made at rest and at maximal exercise level.; In ACEI-naïve patients, CLZ 0.5 and 1 mg/d orally caused a dose-dependent decrease in diastolic PCWP and PAP, and a significant reduction in SVR mg. A slight increase in CI was observed in all groups. The maximum effect was seen 3-5 hours after dosing. After 12 weeks of oral treatment, the acute response was similar but attenuated relative to the first dose. Exercise tolerance was improved in a dose-dependent manner. The NYHA classification was unchanged or improved in most patients. Entry into the 2.5 mg group had to be stopped early due to serious adverse effects seen after the first dose; During chronic treatment, the hemodynamic response to oral cilazapril was attenuated, indicating that continued clinical improvement in CHF patients treated with CLZ is independent of its acute hemodynamic effects.",0,0

We wanted to confirm the disparate responses to the first dose of these agents, study the response to repeated dosing, and explore possible explanations (slow binding, strong binding, and steric hindrance) for the phenomenon. Forty-eight elderly patients (age 51-85 years) with stable CHF were studied for 48 hours. Groups (n = 12) received one of the following: (a) perindopril 2 mg orally (po) + placebo intravenous (iv) (day 1) and perindopril 2 mg po (day 2); (b) enalapril 2.5 mg po + placebo iv (day 1) and enalapril 2.5 mg po (day 2); (c) placebo po + perindopril 0.167 mg iv (day 1) and perindopril 2 mg po (day 2); or (d) placebo po + placebo iv (day 1) and placebo po (day 2). Supine BP was measured on day 1. On day 2, BP was recorded using an ambulatory BP monitor. Blood samples were taken at baseline and at intervals during the 48-h study period for estimation of neurohumoral parameters. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was estimated by plasma ACE inhibition and also by the ratio of angiotensin II (Ang II)/Ang I + Ang II. On day I, enalapril 2.5 mg caused a greater decrease in BP than the placebo response between 6 and 9 hours post-dose. Perindopril 2 mg produced a BP response profile similar to that of placebo. Ambulatory BP on day 2 was consistently lower with enalapril compared with perindopril. Plasma ACE inhibition profiles were similar with each active therapy. Enalapril therapy produced a greater increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) than other treatments. There was no temporal dissociation between plasma ACE inhibition and Ang peptide profile for any treatment. We have confirmed the disparate responses of AP to perindopril and enalapril in CHF. We noted no evidence of slow binding, strong binding, or steric hindrance to explain these differences.",0,0

1970,8861547,Fosinopril: a reappraisal of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in essential hypertension.,,"Wagstaff, A J; Davis, R; McTavish, D","Fosinopril is a phosphinic acid derivative that undergoes rapid hydrolysis after oral administration to the active ACE-inhibiting diacid fosinoprilat. Cardiotropic effects have been associated with the drug, and the compensatory dual elimination pathway of fosinopril through the renal and hepatic systems offers an opportunity for ACE inhibitor treatment of hypertension in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Comparative monotherapy trials with fosinopril 10 to 40 mg/day have shown equivalent antihypertensive efficacy to sustained-release nifedipine 40 mg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 to 50 mg/day, enalapril 5 to 10 mg/day, amlodipine 5 to 10 mg/day and sustained-release verapamil 240 to 480 mg/day, and higher than isradipine 5 mg/day. The efficacy of combination therapy with fosinopril 10 to 20 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/day was significantly superior to hydrochlorothiazide alone, tended to be superior to fosinopril 20 mg/day alone, and was similar to nifedipine. sustained-release 40 mg/day alone. The combination of fosinopril/chlorthalidone 20 to 40/25 mg/day was as effective as propranolol/chlorthalidone 80 to 160/25 mg/day. The incidence of adverse effects associated with fosinopril is low, and cough may occur less frequently with this drug than with other ACE inhibitors.

1972,8862965,"ACE inhibitor-induced cough and bronchospasm. Incidence, mechanisms and management.",,"Overlack, A","dry, tickly, and often annoying cough is the most common side effect of ACE inhibitors. Recent studies indicate that cough may develop in about 10% of patients treated with ACE inhibitors. In half of these patients, the ACE inhibitor should be discontinued. Cough has emerged as a class effect occurring with all ACE inhibitors with no clear difference between the individual substances. Although ACE inhibition is safe in the vast majority of patients with obstructive airway disease, asthmatic symptoms or exacerbation of asthma, as well as increased bronchial reactivity, have been reported occasionally. ACE inhibition increases the cough reflex. The mechanisms underlying ACE inhibitor-induced cough are probably related to suppression of kininase II activity, which may be followed by an accumulation of kinins, substance P, and prostaglandins. Physicians should be aware that dry cough is the most common adverse effect of ACE inhibitors and that this symptom may occur not necessarily soon after initiation of treatment, but months or even a year later. Replacement with another ACE inhibitor should not be attempted, as the cough will almost always recur with the same or another ACE inhibitor.

1973,8862977,Evidence of cardiovascular medication-induced depression: a prescription sequence symmetry analysis.,,"Hallas, J","Many cardiovascular drugs have been implicated as causes of depression. With the exception of beta blockers, few have been studied in formal epidemiological designs. I present a new approach to such analyzes that effectively controls for confounders that are stable over time. I analyzed the exposure histories of 11,244 incident antidepressant users, using the Odense University pharmacoepidemiological database. All people who started taking beta-blockers and antidepressants during a predefined period were identified. If beta blockers don't cause depression, this particular population should show an equal number of people starting either drug first. A depressive effect of beta-blockers would lead to an excess of people starting beta-blockers first, that is, a non-symmetric distribution of prescription orders. Confounding factors causing co-prescription of the two drugs would rarely be expected to affect symmetry. Initial evaluation showed non-symmetric prescription orders for a wide range of cardiovascular medications. After adjusting for an increasing incidence of antidepressant prescription, I found a depression-provoking effect only for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (rate ratio = 1.29; 95% confidence interval = 1.08-1.56) and calcium channel blockers (rate ratio = 1.31, 95% confidence interval = 1.14-1.51).

While captopril may also be beneficial in this setting, it does not appear to be as effective as D-penicillamine or alpha-mercaptopropionylglycine, and clearly does not add clinical benefit to those thiols. Our study demonstrates that patients with cystinuria have a high risk of recurrence when treated with any contemporary medical program.

Patients treated with enalaprilat showed the smallest overall changes in standard (CKMB) and novel serologic markers of myocardial ischemia (peak TnT: 0.71 (0.1) micrograms/L; peak GPBB: 44 (14) ng /ml); In patients treated with enalaprilat before CPB, both new and more sensitive markers of ischemic myocardial tissue damage were increased significantly less than in an untreated control group. Those treated with enoximone also had lower plasma concentrations of TnT and GPBB than the control group, while clonidine did not reduce the concentration of these markers of myocardial ischemia. Pharmacological interventions, such as continuous infusion of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat, prior to initiation of CPB, may help protect the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury.",0,0

A 48-week, double-blind, randomized study was conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of 'high' versus 'low' continuation angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in severe heart failure. Eighty-three patients (56 +/- 1.1 years; 69 men, 14 women) in New York Heart Association functional class III/IV on digoxin, furosemide, and 'low' angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril < or = 50 mg.day-1 or enalapril < or = 10 mg.day-1). After a run-in period of > or = 14 days with enalapril 10 mg.day-1, digitalis, and furosemide, right heart catheterization was performed at rest and exercise. All patients presented atrial pressure > 10 mmHg and/or pulmonary arterial pressure > 35 mmHg and/or cardiac index < 2.5 l.min-1.m-2 at rest. Patients then received enalapril 5 mg twice daily (n = 42) or 20 mg twice daily (n = 41) in random order. Therefore, patients randomized to low-dose enalapril actually had no change in therapy from baseline to 48 weeks. Forty-three patients (52%) completed the study, 19 patients on the low dose and 24 patients on the high dose. Both doses equally influenced survival with 15 (18%) deaths, eight with low dose and seven with high dose. After 48 weeks, functional capacity by New York Heart Association class improved more with the high dose than with the low dose (P = 0.04). In contrast, changes in invasive hemodynamic variables at rest and exercise, as well as maximal exercise capacity, were comparable in both groups. Diastolic blood pressure decreased and the change between both groups was statistically significant (P = 0.01). Changes in plasma creatinine levels did not differ between high and low dose treatment and no patient had to be withdrawn due to impaired renal function. With regard to neurohumoral activity, a trend for a discrepant response to both treatments was observed with a moderate increase in norepinephrine at high versus low dose of enalapril. Thus, treatment with high doses of enalapril was shown to be superior to low doses in terms of symptoms in severe heart failure after long-term treatment, despite having similar effects on hemodynamics and maximal exercise capacity.",0,0

After a 2-week washout period, patients with office diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 120 mm Hg received trandolapril, 2 mg once daily for 4 weeks. Four days of BP self-recording were performed both at the end of the washout period and at the end of the treatment period with a device equipped with an automatic printer using the oscillometric method (A&D UA 751). Every day, a series of three consecutive measurements were planned in the morning before drug intake and repeated at night. A total of 1710 patients (946 men, 764 women) aged 56 years +/- 11 years entered the study. In the 816 patients who correctly performed self-monitoring of blood pressure (SBP) during both periods and followed the protocol schedule, office BP (SBP/DBP) decreased from 166.4 +/- 15/101.4 + /- 6 mm Hg to 144.7 +/- 14/86.1 +/- 8 mm Hg while the MAP decreased from 153 +/- 18/94 +/- 10 mm Hg to 139 +/- 16/85 +/- 10mmHg. A weak correlation was found between the two methods with respect to systolic (r = 0.47, P < 0.0001) and diastolic (r = 0.36, P < 0.0001) BP lowering. Individual response to therapy varied between the two methods: 633 patients (77.6%) had a decrease in office DBP of at least 10 mm Hg, while 493 (60.4%) had a decrease in self-measured DBP of at least 6 mm Hg at night; 65% of the patients were considered responders with both methods. 24-hour therapeutic coverage was assessed by morning-to-evening BP lowering ratio (M/E ratio), which represents the ratio of minimal effect to efficacy 12 hours after dosing. Both the population and individual M/E ratios ranged from 73% to 86%, confirming the long duration of action of trandolapril.; (1) discrepancies have been reported between office-based BP therapeutic response assessment and self-measurement: concordance between the two methods is obtained in only 65% of patients, mainly due to intra-individual BP variability and registration conditions; and (2) self-measured BP could be a potential tool to explore 24-h therapeutic coverage.",0,0

ACE inhibitors were replaced by nifedipine or clonidine in 15 immunocompromised kidney transplant patients with AZA and prednisone (enalapril in 14 and captopril in 1). Before and for 10 to 12 weeks after ACE inhibitor withdrawal, AZA metabolites, renal function parameters, and hematologic parameters, including erythropoietin and reticulocytes, were assessed. Enalaprilat levels were measured and compared with 15 similar patients matched for transplant function and dose of enalapril immunosuppressed with cyclosporine and prednisone. AZA metabolites did not differ significantly in the presence or absence of ACE inhibitors. Enalaprilat levels also did not show significant differences between the two groups of patients treated with AZA or cyclosporine. Hematocrit and hemoglobin increased significantly from 37.5 +/- 6.4 to 39.7 +/- 3.6% (mean +/- SD, P = 0.02) and 12.8 +/- 2, 2 to 13.5 +/- 1.2 g/dl, P = 0.04, respectively, 10 to 12 weeks after discontinuation of ACE inhibitors. Simultaneously, reticulocyte numbers and erythropoietin concentrations increased significantly after 2, 4, and 10 weeks, peaking at two weeks (from 14.1 +/- 3.8 to 20.6 +/- 8.0 /1000, P < 0.05 and from 14.3 +/- 12.4 to 29.3 +/- 54.5 mU/ml, P < 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, anemia associated with ACE inhibitors in kidney transplant recipients seems to be due to the erythropoietin-lowering effect of this group of drugs. A pharmacokinetic interaction between AZA and enalapril is not likely since plasma enalaprilat levels were independent of immunosuppressive regimen and AZA metabolite levels did not change in the presence and absence of ACE inhibitors. Several mechanisms by which angiotensin-converting enzyme blockade may cause a decrease in circulating erythropoietin are discussed.",0,0

In vitro epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation was significantly decreased during HCT2 treatment, the threshold increased to 10 microM compared to 1.0 with placebo (P < 0.05) at rest, and the threshold for adenosine diphosphate aggregation ( ADP) also increased, from 2 microM to 4 (NS). The resting plasma PF4 value decreased, although not significantly, during HCT2 treatment from the placebo value of 3.28 to 2.56 ng/mL. During treatment with spirapril there were no changes in the epinephrine or ADP threshold for platelet aggregation sampled at rest, and plasma PF4 levels did not show significant reductions at rest. However, during exercise, PF4 showed an approximate doubling of the resting value, regardless of therapy. This exercise-induced increase in PF4 was significantly reduced with spirapril compared with placebo (P < 0.05). ECLT and t-PA did not change significantly from the placebo level during either therapy. PAI-1 did not change during spirapril therapy, but during HCT2 treatment it fell, although not significantly, to 9.36 IU/mL from 15.91 with placebo (NS). Spirapril and HCT2 did not produce any undesirable side effects on platelet function or fibrinolysis. HCT2 appears to decrease resting platelet activity, while spirapril appears to decrease exercise platelet activity to some extent.",0,0

Electrocardiograms, blood biochemistry, complete blood counts, urinalysis, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone levels were monitored during the study. Moexipril or verapamil SR, in combination with low doses of hydrochlorothiazide, resulted in a decrease in blood pressure in the sitting and standing positions. No correlation was demonstrated between blood pressure response and baseline plasma renin activity.

However, after 2 years, the two therapies were equally effective in this regard, raising questions about the long-term superiority of ACE inhibition in this regard. To elucidate whether the greater renal preservation with the ACE inhibitor was a transient effect, the GFR was measured after a further year of treatment, that is, after 36 months. At that time, the decline in GFR was significantly less in the ACE inhibitor group compared to the beta-adrenergic blocker group (-3.0 [-5.5, -1.0; 95% CI ] vs -7.0 [-9.0, -4.5, 95% CI] ml/min x 1.73 m2, p = 0.026).

Impotence or ejaculatory failure was reported in 2.1% of patients, decreased libido in 1%, and gynecomastia and related conditions in 0.4%. Impotence was the most common reason for discontinuation of finasteride and was the most commonly reported adverse drug reaction. Of the patients included in the elderly cohort involved in this study, 819 (5.5%) died; none of these deaths were attributed to finasteride; Ejaculatory impotence or failure, decreased libido, and gynecomastia in a small proportion of patients were associated with the use of finasteride.

1998,8886549,An economic analysis of captopril in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. The Collaborative Study Group.,,"Rodby, R A; Firth, L M; Lewis, E J","The results of a recent clinical trial. The effect of ACE inhibition on diabetic nephropathy showed that captopril reduced the rate of renal failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and death in patients with IDDM and nephropathy. The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness of captopril as a therapy in patients with IDDM, as well as the potential savings for all patients with diabetes and kidney disease.; We used the results of a randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing captopril (207 patients) with placebo (202 patients), which aimed to determine whether captopril has kidney-protective properties independent of its effect on blood pressure in diabetic nephropathy to develop a model of medical treatment for patients before progression to ESRD. To model the course of the disease after progression to ESRD and extend the model to NIDDM patients, we used data from the US Renal Data System and published literature. Medical resource cost data was predominantly based on Medicare reimbursement levels, published wholesale drug prices, and surveys of health care providers. The economic model uses a payer perspective to estimate direct cost. The cost to society (indirect cost) associated with lost patient productivity due to ESRD was also estimated. Using this information, we predicted the annual and lifetime costs incurred if patients with IDDM and NIDDM and overt kidney disease were treated with placebo or captopril. We also built a model of the overall prevalence of diabetic nephropathy to estimate the aggregate savings in total health care expenditures in the US; Captopril treatment resulted in an absolute direct savings or benefit of $32,550 per IDDM patient over their lifetime compared to placebo treatment. For NIDDM patients, direct cost savings totaled $9,900 per patient. Absolute savings were also found for indirect costs: $84,390 per IDDM patient and $45,730 per NIDDM patient. If captopril therapy were initiated in 1995 for patients with IDDM or NIDDM and kidney disease, the aggregate health care cost savings (ie, direct cost savings only) would be $189 million per year by 1999 and $475 million by year in 2004, the current value of the accumulated savings in health care costs during these 10 years would be $2.4 billion; The use of captopril in diabetic nephropathy will lead to significant savings in healthcare costs; furthermore, it will result in indirect cost savings, reflecting the broader societal benefit.",0,0

Losartan, the first in a new class of agents, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, can be given as monotherapy in the treatment of hypertension or to supplement existing therapy. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists block the effects of angiotensin II through preferential binding to the AT1 subtype of the angiotensin II receptor on the cell membrane. Compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, they may provide more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and be associated with a lower frequency of cough as a side effect.",0,0

Participants had an ejection fraction of <0.35 and symptomatic CHF (treatment trial, n = 2465) or asymptomatic CHF (prevention trial, n = 2560). Baseline assessment of predicted HRQoL mortality and CHF-related hospitalizations in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients randomized to enalapril and placebo. The domains that were the strongest univariate predictors of CHF-related mortality and hospitalizations were activities of daily living (relative risk [RR] for mortality: 1.163, p < 0.000; for hospitalization: 1.215, p < 0.000), general health (RR for mortality: 1.205, p < 0.000; for hospitalization: 1.188, p < 0.000), and social functioning (RR for mortality 1.098, p < 0.000; for hospitalization: RR 1.156, p < 0.000).

2001,8888663,Efficacy of spironolactone added to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a loop diuretic for severe chronic congestive heart failure (Aldactone Randomized Evaluation Study [RALES]).,,,"The current study enrolled 214 patients, ages 26 to 83, with symptomatic New York Heart Association class II to IV congestive heart failure. Patients continued their previous therapeutic regimens, which included an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a loop diuretic with or without digitalis. Patients were randomized to 1 of 5 parallel treatment groups: placebo or spironolactone in a single daily dose of 12.5, 25, 50, or 75 mg for 12 weeks. Serum levels of creatinine, urea nitrogen, potassium, plasma renin activity, and pro-atrial N-terminal natriuretic factor (pro-ANF), as well as urine aldosterone levels, were measured periodically. Measurements at 12 weeks compared to baseline indicated significant increases in plasma renin activity and aldosterone excretion and significant decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pro-ANF. Hypokalaemia (serum potassium < 3.4 mmol/L) occurred in 10% of patients treated with placebo and in 0.5% of the spironolactone group. The incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > or = 5.5 mmol/L) was 5% for the placebo group, while it was 5%, 13%, 20%, and 24% for the 12.5, 25, 50, and 75 -mg spironolactone treatment groups, respectively. Predictors of hyperkalaemia included the use of ACE inhibitors other than captopril, the dose of ACE inhibitor, and baseline elevation of serum potassium or creatinine levels. Therefore, daily doses of 12.5 to 25 mg spironolactone co-administered with conventional ACE inhibitor, loop diuretic, and digitalis therapy are relatively safe (provided that serum potassium levels are monitored) and effective in blocking the effects of aldosterone, while reducing the potential for hypokalaemia in patients with heart failure.",0,0

Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and vitamin E therapy may slow the atherosclerotic process; however, definitive evidence in humans is lacking. The Study to Evaluate Carotid Ultrasound Changes in Patients Treated with Ramipril and Vitamin E (SECURE) is designed to evaluate the effects of ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, at 2 doses: 2.5 mg daily ( which has little effect on reducing blood). pressure) and 10 mg daily--and the antioxidant vitamin E, 400 IU daily, on the progression of atherosclerosis in 732 patients using a 3 x 2 factorial study design.

2003,8891468,Lisinopril. A review of its pharmacology and clinical efficacy in the early management of acute myocardial infarction.,,"Goa, K L; Balfour, J A; Zuanetti, G","Following the establishment of its efficacy in hypertension and congestive heart failure, the ACE inhibitor lisinopril has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with myocardial infarction when given as early treatment. The ability of lisinopril to attenuate the deleterious effects of left ventricular remodeling is a key mechanism; however, additional cardioprotective and vasculoprotective actions are postulated to play a role in mediating early benefit. The GISSI-3 trial in >19,000 patients has shown that, when administered orally within 24 hours of symptom onset and continued for 6 weeks, lisinopril (with or without nitrates) produces measurable survival benefits within 1 to 2 days of starting treatment. Compared to no treatment with lisinopril, reductions of 11% in the risk of mortality and 7.7% in a combined endpoint (death plus severe left ventricular dysfunction) were observed at 6 weeks. The advantages were evident in all types of patients. Thus, those at high risk also benefited -women, the elderly, patients with diabetes mellitus and those with previous infarction and/or Killip class > 1-. These gains in combined endpoint events persisted long-term, despite treatment discontinuation after 6 weeks in the majority of patients. At 6 months, the incidence rate for the combined endpoint remained lower than control (a 6.2% reduction). The results of GISSI-3 are consistent with those of large recent investigations (ISIS-4, CCS-1, SMILE) of other ACE inhibitors as early treatment in myocardial infarction. However, the results of the CONSENSUS II trial (using intravenous enalaprilat followed by oral enalapril) were unfavorable in some patients. These findings, along with the development of persistent hypotension and, to a lesser extent, renal dysfunction among patients in the GISSI-3 trial, have generated considerable debate about optimal treatment strategies. Current opinion generally holds that therapy with lisinopril or other ACE inhibitors that have been shown to be beneficial can be started within 24 hours in hemodynamically stable patients with no other contraindications; current labeling in the US and other countries reflects this position. There is virtually unanimous agreement that such therapy is indicated in high-risk patients, particularly those with left ventricular dysfunction. The choice of ACE inhibitor seems less important than the decision to treat; it seems likely that these benefits are a class effect. Lisinopril has a similar tolerability profile to other ACE inhibitors, can be administered once daily, and may be less expensive than other members of its class. However, current cost analyzes are flawed and this last point has yet to be tested in formal cost-effectiveness analyses. In conclusion, early treatment with lisinopril (within 24 hours of symptom onset) for 6 weeks improves survival and reduces cardiovascular morbidity in patients with myocardial infarction, and confers continued benefit after drug discontinuation. Although patients with symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction are prime candidates for treatment, all those who are hemodynamically stable with no other contraindications are also eligible for treatment. Lisinopril and other ACE inhibitors that have been shown to be beneficial should therefore be considered an integral part of early treatment of myocardial infarction in suitable patients.",0,0

Ibopamine exerts hemodynamic and neurohumoral effects and is beneficial in mild heart failure; however, its additive value in more advanced disease is unclear.; The study was an independent, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group comparison of ibopamine (100 mg 3 times daily) and placebo in 59 patients with New York Heart Association functional class III-IV heart failure. Patients were clinically stable on pharmacological treatment, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and were randomized to receive ibopamine (n = 29) or placebo (n = 30). Assessments were performed at baseline and after 3 months of treatment, and included measurement of maximal oxygen consumption, plasma neurohormones, ambulatory arrhythmias, and heart rate variability. At baseline, the two groups were well matched, including age (mean, 63 years), left ventricular ejection fraction (0.23), and maximal oxygen consumption (15.4 mL/min/kg). . After 3 months, four patients dropped out of the study due to progressive heart failure (ibopamine, n = 1; placebo, n = 3; not significant) and two due to side effects (n = 1/1). Exercise time and maximal oxygen uptake were not significantly affected (exercise time: ibopamine, +54 [95% confidence interval, -12, 120] seconds; placebo, +19 [-42, 81] seconds maximal oxygen consumption: ibopamine, +0.3 [-0.5, 1.2] mL/min/kg; placebo, +0.2 [-0.7, 1.0] mL/min/kg) .

Response rates were similar in both regimens. Adverse events were assessed by interview and standard questionnaire. The overall prevalence of adverse events reported by the standard questionnaire was higher than that reported spontaneously during the interviews. With regard to typical ACE inhibitor adverse reactions (eg, cough and taste disturbances), there were no differences between quinapril and metoprolol regardless of mode of reporting. In summary, both drugs showed comparable overall tolerability and safety. The discrepancy between spontaneously reported and questionnaire-reported adverse events was notable, and this finding prevailed in a volunteer group of 327 patients who were treated with quinapril for 52 weeks. Therefore, a questionnaire is of great importance in addition to patient history/interview in a large-scale double-blind study designed to learn the details of drug safety.",0,0
2007,8901825,Left ventricular hypertrophy and QT dispersion in hypertension.,,"Mayet, J; Shahi, M; McGrath, K; Poulter, N R; Sever, P S; Foale, R A; Thom, S A","The interlead variation in the length of the QT interval on a standard electrocardiograph reflects regional repolarization differences in the heart. To investigate the association between this variation between leads (QT dispersion) and left ventricular hypertrophy, we subjected 100 untreated subjects to electrocardiography and 12-lead echocardiography. In addition, 24 previously untreated subjects underwent a 6-month treatment study with ramipril and felodipine. In the cross-sectional part of the study, QT dispersion corrected for heart rate (QTc dispersion) was significantly correlated with left ventricular mass index (r = 0.30, P < 0.01), systolic pressure (r = 0.30, P < 0.01), the ratio of the peak flow velocity of the initial filling wave to the peak flow velocity of the atrial wave (E/A ratio) (r = -0.22, P = 0.02), isovolumetric relaxation time (r = 0.31, p < 0.01) and age (r = 0.21, p < 0.04). In the treatment portion of the study, lead-adjusted QTc dispersion decreased from 24 to 19 milliseconds after treatment, and after 2 weeks of drug washout it remained at 19 milliseconds (p < 0.01). The changes in the left ventricular mass index in these stages were 144, 121 and 124 g/m2 (p < 0.01). Systolic pressure decreased from 175 to 144 mm Hg and increased again to 164 mm Hg after drug washout (p < 0.01). E/A ratio (0.97, 1.02, and 1.02; P = 69) and isovolumic relaxation time (111, 112, and 112; P = 0.97) remained unchanged at all three assessment points. . In conclusion, QT interval dispersion increases in association with increased left ventricular mass index in hypertensive individuals. Antihypertensive treatment with ramipril and felodipine reduced both parameters. If a greater QT dispersion is a predictor of sudden death in this group of individuals, then the importance of its reduction is evident.",0,0

The objective of this study was to compare the changes in the components of the renin-angiotensin system with the changes in blood pressure in hypertensive patients, after the suspension of prolonged treatment with ramipril. Twenty hypertensive patients, treated for at least three months with ramipril, in monotherapy during the last three weeks, were randomly assigned to two parallel groups and received for fifteen days, in double bond, either a placebo (withdrawal group W, n = 12 ) or ramipril at the above doses (treated group T, n = 8). Blood pressure was measured using four different techniques. Active plasma concentrations of renin (AR), angiotensinogen, angiotensin I (ang I), angiotensin II (ang II), and aldosterone, as well as plasma angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) activity in vitro (colorimetric method). and fluorometric) and in vivo (the ang II/ang I ratio). The biological effects of long-term cessation of ramipril treatment in hypertensive patients were a decrease in AR and angiotensin I concentrations, an increase in ACE activity, and no significant change in angiotensinogen, angiotensin II, and aldosterone levels. Fifteen days after withdrawal, the different parameters of the renin-angiotensin system seem to have returned to baseline. A slow increase in blood pressure was also observed, but no rebound increase was observed over 15 days in either angiotensin II levels or blood pressure. After discontinuation of long-term treatment with ramipril, the in vivo converting enzyme inhibition slowly disappears, probably due to the slow tight binding inhibitory properties of ramiprilat, the active metabolite of this ICS. The gradual decrease in plasma FA levels, together with the prolonged ACE inhibition measured in vivo by the ang II/ang I ratio, explains the lack of an increase in ang II synthesis.",0,0

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have variable effects on proteinuria; Its long-term effects on the progression of diabetic nephropathy are unknown. The current study tests the hypothesis that CCBs that maintain reductions in proteinuria delay the progression of nephropathy associated with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) to a degree comparable to that of ACE inhibitors, given similar levels of Control of blood pressure. To test this hypothesis, we randomized 52 patients with NIDDM-associated nephropathy and hypertension, mean age 63 +/- 8 years, to the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril (N = 18), non-dihydropyridine CCBs (NDCCB), verapamil SR ( N = 8) or diltiazem SR (N = 10), or the beta-blocker, atenolol (N = 16). The target blood pressure was < or = 140/90 mm Hg. The patients were followed up for a mean period of 63 +/- 7 months. The primary end point was the change in the slope of creatinine clearance (CCr) in each group. There was no significant difference in mean arterial pressure reduction between the groups during the study period (P = 0.14). The mean rate of decline in CCr was greater in the atenolol group (-3.48 ml/min/year/1.73 m2; P < 0.0001). There was no difference in CCr slopes between the lisinopril and NDCCB groups (P = 0.36). Proteinuria was reduced to a similar degree in the lisinopril and NDCCB groups (P > 0.99). Therefore, in people with kidney failure secondary to NIDDM, similar levels of blood pressure control with lisinopril or NDCCB delayed kidney disease progression to a greater extent than with atenolol. Furthermore, this greater slowing of kidney disease progression correlated with sustained and significant reductions in proteinuria, findings that were not seen in the atenolol group.",0,0

A total of 409 insulin-dependent diabetic patients with established kidney disease were enrolled in a trial of the effect of Captopril on the rate of progression of kidney disease. Baseline demographic, clinical (history and physical), and laboratory parameters were analyzed as risk factors for time to progression. Dichotomous characteristics were compared using Fisher's exact test and continuous characteristics using Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Univariate proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of kidney disease progression and bivariate proportional hazards regression was used to identify interactions with treatment group assignment. Multivariable proportional hazard regression was used to determine which characteristics were independent risk factors. We found that several demographic and clinical characteristics were significantly associated with nephropathy progression even after adjustment for treatment group. However, after multivariate analysis, risk factors that independently predicted progression were onset of IDDM later in life, parental diagnosis of IDDM, presence of edema, increased blood pressure average and an abnormal electrocardiogram. Likewise, a series of laboratory characteristics were also predictive of the progression of nephropathy. Low hematocrit, high blood sugar, and increased protein excretion predicted nephropathy progression as did higher serum creatinine, particularly versus normal serum albumin. In conclusion, this study identifies a number of clinical and laboratory risk factors that may predict which patients with insulin-dependent diabetes with established kidney disease are more likely to experience clinically important decline in kidney function during a median follow-up of three years.",0,0

ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce left ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction. In the GISSI-3 trial, patients were randomly assigned, within 24 hours of the onset of myocardial infarction symptoms, to 6 weeks of treatment with lisinopril, nitroglycerin, both, or neither, in a 2 x 2 open factorial design. The study showed that early treatment in relatively unselected patients with lisinopril decreases 6-week mortality and severe left ventricular dysfunction. We evaluated (1) the prognostic value of 2D echocardiographic variables prior to discharge and (2) the effects of lisinopril on the progression of left ventricular dilatation; 2-D echocardiograms were available before discharge in 8619 GISSI-3 patients discharged alive. In 6405 of these patients, a 2D echocardiographic study was also available at 6 weeks and 6 months.

Furthermore, activation of the renin-angiotensin system occurs frequently in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Theoretically, administration of ACE inhibitors may increase sodium and water retention in cirrhotic patients with ascites. In this study, we evaluated the role of low-dose captopril on changes in renal function, renal plasma flow, and hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Fifty patients are randomly assigned to receive captopril or placebo for 14 days. Renal functions, renal plasma flow, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone concentration, and systemic and hepatic hemodynamics are measured before and after treatment. Our results indicate that placebo administration did not affect any of the parameters measured in this study. The finding that low-dose captopril significantly increases plasma renin activity suggests that the dose used in this study effectively blocks enzyme activity. However, low-dose captopril does not affect renal plasma flow, renal functions, and systemic and hepatic hemodynamics. The results of this study demonstrate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition alone may not improve sodium and water retention in cirrhotic patients with ascites.",0,0

Effects of antihypertensive therapy.,,"Alli, C; Lombardo, M; Zanni, D; Agrati, A M; Cassani, M; Granata, S","The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of an ACE inhibitor (fosinopril) and a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) on urinary albumin and transferrin excretion and their relationship to blood pressure in essential hypertension. Twenty-four treatment-naïve patients (mean age, 46.4 +/- 8.9 years) with diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 114 mm Hg and normal renal function, were randomly given either amlodipine or fosinopril and, if diastolic blood pressure did not normalize, Doxazosin was added to therapy. Before and after 3 and 6 months of treatment, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and 24-hour urine collection for albumin and transferrin were performed. Diastolic blood pressure normalized in 23 patients (96%). Before treatment, microalbuminuria was present in 50% of patients. In the amlodipine and fosinopril group, antihypertensive therapy significantly decreased blood pressure and, only in the fosinopril group, albuminuria. Transferrinuria did not change significantly in both groups. Fosinopril reduced albuminuria in all patients, while amlodipine only reduced albuminuria in half of the patients. Albuminuria, but not transferrinuria, was significantly correlated with ambulatory blood pressure. This correlation was more pronounced for systolic than diastolic pressure. In essential hypertensive patients with normal renal function, a high prevalence of microalbuminuria can be observed. Albuminuria appears to correlate with ambulatory blood pressure, particularly systolic pressure. Intrarenal hemodynamic changes appear to play a more important role than lower systemic blood pressure in reducing albuminuria.

Reducing blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension requires increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system. Losartan, the first orally active non-peptide angiotensin antagonist, specifically competes with angiotensin II (Ang II) for the AT1 receptor and alters it reversibly. Maximum reductions in blood pressure occur after doses of approximately 50 mg, although some patients will require 100 mg; the parent compound and a metabolite are responsible for a mild 24-hour effect on blood pressure. Once-daily dosing with losartan has been documented to be safe. The safety of the drug has been evaluated in 4,058 patients; Of these patients, more than 1,200 were treated for more than 6 months and more than 800 were treated for more than 1 year at doses from 10 mg to 150 mg. Overall, no hypertensive patient was withdrawn from treatment due to elevated serum potassium or creatinine levels, and there were no reports of angioedema. In addition, some reductions in plasma uric acid levels were observed. Cough occurred significantly less frequently in patients treated with losartan than in those treated with hydrochlorothiazide or lisinopril.

As for non-thiol drugs, the pathological mechanism of acantholysis has not yet been explained; To explain the molecular mechanism of enalapril-induced acantholysis, a potential link between transglutaminase (TGase) activity and the effects of this drug was investigated.; TGase activity was evaluated in vitro in human breast skin extracts cultured in the presence of thiopronin, captopril and enalapril. The acantholytic potential of cystamine, a known TGase inhibitor, was also investigated; Enalapril, the most potent acantholytic drug in vitro, was found to inhibit both purified enzyme and TGase activity in cultured human breast skin explant extracts. Kinetic studies showed that enalapril inhibition was competitive with respect to the amino acceptor substrate and non-competitive with respect to the amino donor substrate.

Recent studies have provided a theoretical framework to anticipate that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and possibly calcium channel blockers, may preferentially slow the progression of kidney disease. While most of the available clinical trials have evaluated the effects of ACE inhibitors in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), there are relatively few long-term studies that have evaluated the renal protective effects of ACE inhibitors and Calcium antagonists in patients with diabetes mellitus. non-diabetic kidney disease. Although clinical trials using both drug classes as monotherapy have been initiated, theoretical considerations suggest that fixed-dose combinations of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist might be attractive as renal protective agents. Several lines of evidence suggest that the renal microcirculatory effects of coadministration of both agents should be complementary. Similarly, recent observations suggest that the two classes may act in a complementary manner to counteract pathogenic mechanisms at the level of the mesangium. A recent study in type II diabetic patients showed that combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist induced the greatest reduction in proteinuria and slowed the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) more than either. agents alone at the same level. of blood pressure reduction. Based on such considerations, recent prospective randomized studies have been initiated to compare the renal protective effects of combination therapy with calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors versus monotherapy with agents from either of these two antihypertensive classes.",0,0

Forty hypertensive patients treated with perindopril and 42 with nitrendipine were studied. We evaluated aortic stiffness by measuring carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Carriers of the AT1-RC allele showed higher baseline values of pulse wave velocity than homozygotes AA (P < 0.05). In the perindopril group, a three-fold reduction in pulse wave velocity was observed in carriers of the C allele than in AA homozygotes (-2.85 +/- 0.62 vs. -0.94 + /- 0.32 m/s, respectively; p < 0.001), while in the nitrendipine group, pulse wave velocity decreased only in AA homozygotes and not in AT1-RC carriers (-1, 38 +/- 0.35 versus +0.04 +/- 0.60 m/s, respectively, P < 0.01). These results indicate that depending on the AT1-R A1166C genotype, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker affect pulse wave velocity in opposite ways.

Studies were repeatedly performed for up to 2 years during a controlled trial on the effect of enalapril on the progression of renal failure. The pattern of proteinuria was followed during the first 9 months. At baseline, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ranged from 5 to 68 mL/min. The absolute rate of proximal tubular fluid reabsorption (APR), estimated as the difference between GFR and C(Li), ranged from 1 to 54 mL/min. The calculated fractional proximal resorption (FPR) was moderately subnormal. During the study, glomerular filtration rate decreased and sodium clearance did not change; therefore, fractional excretion of sodium increased. In the group of patients randomized to treatment with enalapril (n = 34), the GFR at one month was 83% (P < 0.001) and the C(Li) was 88% (P < 0.01) of baseline values , APR and RPF were not significantly changed and potassium clearance was significantly decreased. During the rest of the study period, APR remained almost unchanged and FPR even increased in the enalapril group. In the group of patients randomized to treatment with conventional antihypertensive drugs (n = 35), C(Li) remained unchanged until the severe reduction in GFR, APR, and RPF gradually decreased, and potassium clearance was almost nonexistent. modified. These differences in tubular function between the two treatment regimens were significant (P < 0.05). An unchanged or increased APR in either treatment regimen was associated with slower long-term progression of renal failure. Over 9 months, 24-hour fractional albumin clearance decreased in the ACE inhibitor group (P < 0.01), whereas immunoglobulin G and retinol-binding protein clearance did not change in this group. In the conventional group, the fractional clearances of these three plasma proteins were increased. We conclude that in progressive chronic kidney disease treatment with ACE inhibitors was associated with different adaptive tubular changes in sodium, water and protein handling compared to conventional antihypertensive therapy. During ACE inhibition, the reabsorptive capacity of the proximal tubule seemed to be better preserved, which could be important for the beneficial effect of this treatment in chronic kidney disease.",0,0

However, the mechanism of the antiproteinuric effect has not been clarified. We conducted a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover trial to test the hypothesis that the antiproteinuric effect of ramipril was due to an improvement in glomerular permselectivity independent of blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate. The effect of low doses (1.25 mg/day) and high doses (5 mg/day) of ramipril was evaluated in 15 normotensive non-diabetic patients with proteinuria (>150 mg/day).

Blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow rate, urinary protein excretion rate, and plasma angiotensin II levels were measured at the end of each period. Mean arterial pressure, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and albumin excretion rate were significantly decreased during low and high doses of ramipril. Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow rate did not change significantly. Plasma levels of angiotensin II decreased with high and low doses of ramipril. There were no episodes of hypotension and only one subject developed a cough during ramipril that did not require study drug discontinuation. In conclusion, low- and high-dose ramipril administration lowered blood pressure and reduced proteinuria in this cohort of normotensive patients with a variety of proteinuric kidney diseases. The antiproteinuric effect of ramipril is probably mediated by a reduction in glomerular capillary pressure.",0,0

Therapeutic requirements to maintain strict control of blood pressure.,,,"We report the efficacy of therapy during a 5-year follow-up in 758 noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients in a prospective, randomized, controlled study of therapy for mild hypertension. Patients who, on antihypertensive therapy, had systolic blood pressure greater than 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 85 mmHg, or if they were not on therapy, had systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg. His mean blood pressure at study entry was 160/94 mmHg at a mean age of 57 years. They were assigned to tight control (goal systolic < 150/diastolic < 85 mmHg) or less tight control (goal systolic < 180/diastolic < 105 mmHg). The strict control group was assigned to primary therapy with a beta-blocker (atenolol) or an antiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril), with the addition of other agents as needed. Over 5 years, mean arterial pressure in the strict control group was significantly lower (143/82 vs 154/88 mmHg, p < 0.001). No differences were observed between those assigned to atenolol or captopril. The proportion of patients who required three or more antihypertensive treatments to maintain tight control in those assigned to atenolol or captopril increased from 16% and 15%, respectively, at 2 years, to 25% and 26%, respectively, at 5 years, while in the less strict control group at 2 and 5 years only 5 and 7%, respectively, required three or more therapies. There was no difference in the incidence of side effects or hypoglycaemic episodes between those assigned to atenolol or captopril, but those assigned to atenolol increased their body weight by a mean of 2.3 kg compared to 0.5 kg in those assigned to captopril (p < 0.01). Assignment to atenolol was also associated with small increases in triglycerides and decreases in LDL and HDL cholesterol, which are of uncertain clinical relevance. The study continues to determine if the better blood pressure control obtained will be beneficial in maintaining the health of patients by reducing the incidence of major clinical complications, mainly myocardial infarction and stroke, and microvascular complications, such as severe retinopathy requiring photocoagulation. and impaired renal function.",0,0

The study also examined the ability of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to discern pharmacodynamic patterns in patients with congestive heart failure, which is associated with less variability in circadian variations in blood pressure and heart rate among hospitalized patients. Increased plasma norepinephrine, renin activity, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are positively correlated with worsening clinical status. ACE inhibitors have been found to be beneficial in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Ambulatory 24-h neurohumoral and blood pressure measurements were recorded in 30 patients with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class II-IV) before treatment with lisinopril or captopril and repeated after 6 weeks of treatment. Fourier analysis was used as a curve smoothing technique to compare the pharmacodynamics of the two ACE inhibitors. The absolute amplitude of systolic blood pressure was inversely correlated with plasma norepinephrine and ANP (p = 0.004), but not with renin activity. The 24-hour mean systemic arterial pressure did not decrease significantly after treatment with ACE inhibitors. An increase in the absolute amplitude of systolic blood pressure was inversely correlated with the initial amplitude (p < 0.00001). Inspection of smooth Fourier curves demonstrated differences in the circadian effect of lisinopril and captopril on systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may be helpful in assessing the severity and management of congestive heart failure.",0,0

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of moexipril with that of captopril during a 12-week treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Patients with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of 95-114 mm Hg, inclusive, were randomized 2:1 to receive moexipril 7.5 mg once daily or captopril 25 mg twice daily. up to date. After 6 weeks of treatment, the dose of moexipril and captopril was increased to 15 mg once daily and 50 mg twice daily, respectively, if the patient's SBP remained > or = 90 mm Hg. Blood pressure was measured at fortnightly visits. At the end of the study, the adjusted mean reductions in SDBP were comparable between the moexipril and captopril groups (-9.8 vs. -8.7 mm Hg), and moexipril was more effective than captopril in reducing sitting systolic blood pressure. Adverse experiences (headache, dizziness, and upper respiratory tract infection) occurred with similar frequency in the moexipril and captopril groups.

After a four-week placebo run-in phase, patients received ramipril 2.5 mg or enalapril 10 mg once daily for four weeks. Doses were increased to ramipril 5 mg and enalapril 20 mg for a further four weeks. After a four-week placebo washout phase, patients crossed over to the alternative treatment. The decrease in mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure from week 0 to week 8 was 1.6 mmHg greater with ramipril than with enalapril (90% confidence interval: 0.6-2.7 mmHg). The corresponding reduction in systolic blood pressure was also greater with ramipril than with enalapril by 2.4 mmHg (90% confidence interval: 0.5-4.2 mmHg). For the difference in 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure drop between ramipril and enalapril, the lower level of the 90% confidence interval (CI) is above the clinically relevant difference of -3 mmHg. This is an indication that ramipril (2.5 and 5 mg doses) is at least as effective as enalapril (10 and 20 mg doses) in lowering blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The duration of adequate antihypertensive effect was relatively long for both ramipril and enalapril; however, ramipril tended to have a longer antihypertensive effect. Ramipril had a higher diastolic and systolic trough/peak ratio than enalapril, resulting in a more consistent antihypertensive effect over the 24-hour treatment period. Both ramipril and enalapril were well tolerated and the two treatment groups had similar safety profiles.",1,0

Randomized treatment with ramipril or atenolol was continued for 6 months, and echocardiograms were recorded before and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. The echotracers were blindly evaluated at a single reading center.; Two-dimensional M-mode guided echocardiography was used to measure the thickness and dimensions of the left ventricular wall, from which the left ventricular mass was calculated, according to the Penn convention; Of 193 patients at 16 centers, 111 had echocardiograms that could be evaluated quantitatively. The main analysis of the study was performed using data from these patients. In addition, echocardiograms from 88 'per protocol' patients (patients with pre-established values of left ventricular mass) were analyzed. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced by both ramipril and atenolol with no significant difference between the two drug treatments. Heart rate was significantly reduced with atenolol alone. Both 'primary' and 'per protocol' analyzes showed that left ventricular mass was significantly reduced with ramipril alone. Comparison between treatments based on multivariate analysis demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in left ventricular mass during ramipril treatment than during atenolol treatment; The present study is the first of a sufficiently large size in which a direct comparison of the effects of an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker on echocardiographic left ventricular mass has been performed.

Blood pressure, clinical and laboratory safety, specific symptoms including cough as determined by symptom questionnaire, and metabolic variables were examined at baseline and at weeks 6 and 12; Both losartan and enalapril decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure from baseline at weeks 6 and 12. Changes in blood pressure from baseline at trough (22-26 h post-dose) did not differ between the two groups. in the per protocol analysis. Response to treatment in the trough was excellent or good (diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure reduction of 10 mmHg) in 51% and 53% of patients in the losartan and enalapril groups, respectively. Enalapril administration increased dry cough symptoms, while losartan did not. The incidence of dry cough was 1.0 and 12.2% as spontaneously reported malaise at week 12 and 3.0 and 15.1% as clinical adverse experience in the losartan and enalapril groups, respectively. The difference from baseline at week 12 in the incidence of dry cough between the two groups was 14.9% as a specific symptom on the symptom questionnaire. Losartan reduced serum uric acid concentration, while effects on other metabolic parameters did not differ between groups; Losartan is an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive drug that shows blood pressure-lowering efficacy similar to that of enalapril in the valley. However, unlike enalapril, losartan does not increase the incidence of dry cough. Therefore, the angiotensin II antagonist losartan provides a promising new approach for the treatment of hypertension.",0,0

Twelve hypertensive patients with ESRD were included in a double-blind crossover study comparing a single 20-mg dose of the ACE inhibitor quinapril versus placebo. Two study periods of 172 h duration each were separated by a 2-week placebo period. Repeated measurements of the following parameters were made: brachial artery systolic blood pressure (SBP); diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure (using a mercury sphygmomanometer); carotid artery SBP and pulse pressure (by applanation tonometry); aortic stiffness (from pulse wave velocity); and the effect of arterial wave reflections in the common carotid artery (the rate of increase, by applanation tonometry). A radioimmunoassay was used to determine plasma angiotensin II levels. The pharmacokinetics of quinaprilat was studied using a specific assay. Bidirectional analysis of variance (treatment of time) for repeated measures, analysis of covariance for two factors within the factors and a covariate that changes with the level of the time factor (pressures measured at each moment) and reference values of the parameter studied as a the second covariate was used for statistical analysis; Quinapril treatment induced a long-lasting decrease in arterial wave reflexes, which was still observable 172 h after quinapril administration and was still present after removing the effect of blood pressure lowering. The effect on wave reflexes was associated with a more pronounced and sustained decrease in carotid SBP and pulse pressure than in brachial SBP and pulse pressure. Quinapril administration also induced a long-lasting decrease in aortic pulse wave velocity, but this effect was entirely dependent on parallel changes in blood pressure. Arterial hemodynamic changes were not related to plasma levels of angiotensin II or quinaprilat; The results of this controlled study indicate that, in patients with ESRD, ACE inhibition results in a long-lasting, pressure-independent lowering of arterial wave reflexes. The consequence of this was a decrease in the pulsatile pressure load on the central arteries with an increase in aortic compliance. The increase in aortic compliance was due to the decrease in blood pressure. The observed arterial hemodynamic alterations suggest that ACE inhibition induced alterations in arterial wave reflexes in the distal parts of the arterial tree.",0,0

NSVT is associated with increased mortality in CHF. However, the predictive value of NSVT as a marker for sudden death or death from progressive heart failure has not been determined; Five hundred and sixteen patients from the GESICA trial (33.4% with NSVT) were initially studied with 24-hour Holter results and 2-year follow-up. Within 2 years, 87 of 173 patients (50.3%) with NSVT and 106 of 343 patients (30.9%) without NSVT died. The relative risk (RR) was 1.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27 to 2.24; P < 0.0002), and the Cox proportional hazards analysis was 1.62 ( 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.16, P < 0.001).

2054,9000551,Renal failure related to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Textor, S C","The introduction of agents that block the renin-angiotensin system has brought great benefit to patients with hypertension, kidney disease, and congestive heart failure. Some of the therapeutic benefits related to the kidney derive from the removal of angiotensin II in the efferent arteriole. In some circumstances, when the afferent blood supply is compromised, particularly beyond renal artery stenosis, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may lead to a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). ) and impaired potassium excretion, which clinicians should be prepared to identify. and manage. The frequency with which this occurs and when this decrease represents a danger for the viability of the renal parenchyma depends on the initial conditions of the renal vasculature and sodium balance. Although these observations have been made primarily with ACE inhibitors, the basic principles apply to other agents that interact with components of the renin-angiotensin system, including angiotensin II antagonists and renin inhibitors. When promptly identified and treated, changes in renal function under these conditions represent a modest and acceptable risk that is worth taking in exchange for significant therapeutic benefits.",0,0

After a placebo run-in period, 308 patients (all white) were randomly assigned to treatment groups and took medication once daily for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was measured after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment in the period 23 to 26 hours after dosing. Patients used a noninvasive blood pressure monitor for 24 hours before randomization and before the final visit. Investigators recorded adverse experiences at randomization and at study weeks 4 and 8, and obtained samples for laboratory testing at randomization and study week 8. Efficacy was evaluated in 307 patients and tolerability and safety in 308. At endpoint (the last post-randomization measurement for each patient), the reduction in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure with amlodipine 5 mg treatment /20 mg of benazepril was statistically significantly higher than with any comparative treatment.

A combination of enalapril/diltiazem ER was evaluated in 62 patients with Stage 1-3 hypertension and coexisting renal disease. This trial used a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design. The study consisted of a 12-week double-blind phase followed by a 6-month open-label extension phase. The combination of enalapril/diltiazem ER was shown to reduce BP after short- and long-term phases of treatment.

Serum ACE activity is a poor index of neurohormonal suppression or hemodynamic effect after treatment with ACE inhibitors. However, serum ACE activity may be a useful index of adherence to therapy, as serum ACE is sensitive to the presence of an ACE inhibitor in the blood. Sixteen normotensive male volunteers of known ACE genotype received 7 days of randomized double-blind treatment on four occasions 2 weeks apart with lisinopril 20 mg (L) or matching placebo (P) to simulate (A) noncompliance (all P), (B) full compliance (all L), (C) partial compliance (L days, 1, 3, 6; P days, 2, 4, 5, 7), or (D) single dose (L day 7; P, 1-6). Supine (30 min) blood pressure (BP)/heart rate (HR), ACE, and angiotensins were measured on day 7 pre-dose and 4-6 h post-dose. Results are means +/- 1 SD. BP showed the small decrease expected with active treatment at day 7 (B or D), but not with placebo (A) or partial compliance (C). Pre-study serum ACE, despite a wide range (16-124 U/L), was reproducible across subjects [coefficient of variation (CV), 1.7%]. Serum ACE activity, before (41.9 +/- 30) and after (41 +/- 30) angiotensin (A) I or II, was not affected by treatment (placebo A). Active treatment (B) resulted in very low serum ACE activity and d7 and little further suppression after dosing (before, 3.9 +/- 4; after, 1.8 +/- 4) . AI was elevated in this group with a higher elevation after dosing (before, 234 +/- 116; after, 551 +/- 250). AII was only modestly reduced from baseline and showed little additional suppression after dosing (previously 7.8 +/- 4; post 6.3 +/- 5). Partial compliance (C) showed low ACE but no reduction after treatment (before, 7 +/- 3; after, 7 +/- 4), an elevated AI but no dosing effect (before, 187 +/- 198; after , 200 +/- 151) and reduced AII but no further dose suppression (before, 6.4 +/- 3.4; after, 7 +/- 4) induced increase in peptide (compared to B). Single dose treatment (D) showed ACE inhibition as expected (before 47 +/- 30, after 2.2 +/- 3). There was a dose-related increase in AI, but to a lesser extent than that seen with the chronic active dose (B) (before, 39 +/- 10; after, 240 +/- 200). In contrast to long-term dosing, there was a marked suppression of ANG II (before, 8.8 +/- 4; after, 2.9 +/- 3). With this long-acting ACE inhibitor at a dose relevant to the treatment of congestive heart failure, we suggest that serum ACE (< 5 EU/L) and elevated ANG I (> 300 pg/ml) 4-6 h after dosing can be used to confirm compliance with treatment. These absolute values may be altered in patients treated concomitantly with loop diuretics. However, in principle this may be a useful tool in clinical trials or in clinical practice after further work has been done to assess limits in patients across doses and the range of available drugs used.",0,0

Previous study designs have often been inadequate to demonstrate the details of interactions between these antihypertensive agents. This study used a modified 4 x 4 factorial randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design to study the efficacy of 17 different doses of fosinopril (Fos), an ACE inhibitor derived from phosphinic acid, and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in 550 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The data for these variables were fitted to quadratic response surface models (QRSM) using polynomial functions on the doses of the two components. Using QRSM, sitting systolic (SeSBP) and diastolic (SeDBP) blood pressure responses at 8 weeks were predicted for actual doses and interpolated for intermediate doses not studied. Fos and HCTZ alone and in combination produced a dose-related reduction in SeSBP and SeDBP. The use of 10 mg Fos + 12.5 mg HCTZ reduced the adjusted mean SeDBP by 6.3 mm Hg and 20 mg Fos + 12.5 mg HCTZ decreased the same measure by 9.1 mm Hg. Coadministration of Fos and HCTZ produced an additive antihypertensive effect.

2063,9010643,benefit-risk assessment of losartan potassium in the treatment of hypertension.,,"Burrell, L M","Losartan potassium is the first in a new class of orally active antihypertensive drugs that antagonize the action of angiotensin (AT) II at the AT1 receptor subtype. Losartan potassium is converted by the liver to the active metabolite E-3174, which is a more potent antagonist of the AT1 receptor. E-3174 is responsible for most of the pharmacological effects of losartan potassium and its long half-life contributes to the long duration of action of the drug. Losartan potassium is effective as an antihypertensive agent once daily. In mild to moderate hypertension, losartan potassium has similar efficacy to enalapril, atenolol, and extended-release felodipine. When losartan potassium is combined with hydrochlorothiazide, a greater reduction in blood pressure occurs. Losartan potassium is well tolerated in mild, moderate, and severe essential hypertension, and the only drug-related adverse effect is dizziness. The overall rate of patient discontinuation due to adverse experiences with losartan potassium is lower (2.3%) than with placebo (3.7%). First-dose hypotension is uncommon, perhaps due to the drug's slower onset of action, and cough does not appear to be a major problem. Several areas related to the safety and efficacy of losartan potassium remain to be clarified. In particular, long-term tolerability studies are needed; cough only became apparent as an adverse effect of ACE inhibitors after 3 to 4 years of use. Post-marketing surveillance has shown that angioedema, a rare but life-threatening adverse effect of ACE inhibitors, also occurs with losartan potassium. More data on the use of losartan potassium in patients with renal insufficiency are needed before accepting the recommendation that no dose adjustment is necessary. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of losartan potassium in patients with liver disease also require further investigation. Losartan potassium increases uric acid secretion and lowers plasma uric acid levels, which may be beneficial when losartan potassium is combined with a thiazide diuretic, but may otherwise lead to uric acid stone formation and possibly kidney disease. Simple control of blood pressure is no longer an adequate goal in the management of hypertension. Any new antihypertensive agent should also reduce cardiovascular events, prevent or cause regression of end-organ damage such as left ventricular hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, and renal failure, and should not affect quality of life. These data on losartan potassium are not currently available. Losartan potassium is likely to be used in patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors, but its future in the treatment of hypertension will depend on long-term tolerability studies and data on its effects beyond simple blood pressure control. blood pressure.",0,0

For 1 year, repeated measurements of echocardiographic parameters, glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, hematocrit, plasma neurohormones, and QTc dispersion were obtained. Echocardiographic parameters improved with enalapril but worsened with placebo (cardiac output 4.6 +/- 1.6 to 3.7 +/- 1.5 L/min with placebo and 4.5 +/- 1.3 to 5, 8 +/- 2.0 L/min with enalapril, p < 0.01).

We conclude that changes in the metabolic variables studied and serum ACE activity during treatment with ACE inhibitors are related to alterations in mineral status and the balance between serum calcium and magnesium concentrations.",0,0

In this double-blind forced titration study design, we compared the effects of mibefradil 50, 100, and 150 mg and nifedipine GITS 30, 60, and 90 mg as monotherapies or combined with lisinopril 20 mg in 71 moderate to severe hypertensives (59 men and 12 women) with confirmed outpatient hypertension. An incremental dose-response effect in both clinical and ambulatory blood pressure parameters was observed during treatment with mibefradil and nifedipine GITS alone and in combination with lisinopril. At the maximum dose, mibefradil-treated patients experienced a greater reduction (p < 0.05) in clinical and ambulatory diastolic blood pressure, as well as a higher response rate (86% vs. 69%). The minimum:maximum ratios for systolic and diastolic blood pressures were >90% at each dose level. A significant decrease in baseline heart rate was observed with mibefradil 150 mg alone or in combination with lisinopril, but no patient experienced clinically significant atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. Adverse events related to vasodilation were more frequent in the nifedipine GITS group. Consequently, the results of the present study demonstrate that the novel calcium channel blocker mibefradil, either alone or in combination with lisinopril, is effective in lowering clinical and 24-hour blood pressure while lowering heart rate and It is well tolerated in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. hypertension.",0,0

The indicators and thresholds were developed and approved by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The medical records of 227 patients prescribed lisinopril between June 1991 and June 1992 were reviewed for appropriateness of prescription, monitoring, occurrence of adverse drug reactions, and detection of drug interactions. The prescription was adequate in 97% and the follow-up was adequate in all the cases reviewed. The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions were cough (7%), hypotension (3%), and rash (2%). Patients have also been prescribed several medications that can interact with lisinopril. Lisinopril appeared to be well tolerated and effective. Forty patients (18%) experienced lisinopril-related adverse drug reactions. There did not appear to be any major shortcomings with the lisinopril prescription and no corrective action was required other than educational activities on the proper use of lisinopril. Information from this drug use review is helpful in making formulary decisions.",0,0

Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS),,"Grimm, R H; Grandits, G A; Prineas, R J; McDonald, R H; Lewis, C E; Flack, J M; Yunis, C; Svendsen, K; Liebson, P R; Elmer, P J","Problems with sexual function have been a long-standing concern in the treatment of hypertension and may influence the choice of treatment regimens and decisions to stop medications. The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) offers an excellent opportunity to examine sexual function and the effects of treatment on sexual function in men and women with stage I diastolic hypertension because of the number of drug classes studied, double-blind study design; and long-term follow-up. TOMHS was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 902 hypertensive individuals (557 men, 345 women), ages 45 to 69, treated with placebo or one of five active drugs (acebutolol, amlodipine maleate, chlorthalidone, doxazosin maleate or enalapril maleate). All participants received intensive lifestyle counseling regarding weight loss, reducing dietary sodium, reducing alcohol (for current drinkers), and increasing physical activity. Sexual function was determined by interviews with physicians at baseline and annually during follow-up. At the start of the study, 14.4% of men and 4.9% of women reported problems with sexual function. In men, 12.2% had problems getting and/or keeping an erection; 2.0% of women reported a problem having an orgasm. Erection problems in men at baseline were positively related to age, systolic pressure, and prior use of antihypertensive drugs. The incidence of erectile dysfunction during follow-up in men was 9.5% and 14.7% at 24 and 48 months, respectively, and was related to the type of antihypertensive treatment. Participants randomized to chlorthalidone reported a significantly higher incidence of erection problems over 24 months than participants randomized to placebo (17.1% versus 8.1%, p = 0.025). Incidence rates at 48 months were more similar between treatment groups than at 24 months, with no significant differences between the chlorthalidone and placebo groups. The incidence was lower in the doxazosin group but was not significantly different from the placebo group. The incidence for the acebutolol, amlodipine, and enalapril groups was similar to that for the placebo group. In many cases, erectile dysfunction did not require medication discontinuation. The disappearance of erection problems among men with problems at the start of the study was common in all groups, but higher in the doxazosin group. The incidence of reported sexual problems in women was low in all treatment groups. In conclusion, the long-term incidence of erectile problems in treated hypertensive men is relatively low, but is higher with chlorthalidone treatment. The effects of erectile dysfunction with chlorthalidone appear relatively early and are often tolerable, and are unlikely to recur after 2 years. The rate of reported sexual problems in hypertensive women is low and does not appear to differ by drug type. Similar incidence rates of erectile dysfunction in placebo and in most active drug groups caution against routinely attributing erectile problems to antihypertensive medication.",0,0

While angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is now the first-line therapy, sympathetic inhibition has recently been proposed for this goal. We recently reported an improvement of preload parameters by sympathetic suppression with clonidine. In the present work we studied the effects of a single oral dose combination of clonidine 0.15 mg + captopril 6.25 mg, compared to captopril 6.15 + placebo in a single-blind parallel study in 16 patients with CHF Class III or IV (13 men, 3 women, 62 +/- 8 years old, with an ejection fraction of 33 +/- 8%). Hemodynamic and hormonal measurements were taken at baseline after diagnostic cardiac catheterization and again 2 hours after treatment. The results indicate that preload parameters such as RAP, PCWP, and MPAP were significantly decreased with combination therapy but not with captopril alone. In contrast, SVR was significantly decreased with both treatments and SVI was significantly increased with both, but the latter change was significantly greater with the captopril/clonidine combination than with captopril alone. Plasma norepinephrine suppression occurred only with the combination (obviously attributable to clonidine), whereas plasma renin activity was increased with both regimens, apparently due to captopril. Our results indicate that the combination of clonidine with captopril induces significant improvements in CHF preload and afterload parameters and correction of activated neurohormones, suggesting additive hemodynamic and hormonal benefits of the two treatment modalities.",0,0

Systolic Hypertension in Europe (SYST-EUR) Trial Investigators.,,"Staessen, J A; Thijs, L; Bijttebier, G; Clement, D; O'Brien, E T; Palatini, P; Rodicio, J L; Rosenfeld, J; Fagard, R","We explore how interindividual variability, correction for placebo effects, and smoothing of blood pressure profiles can be managed in parallel group trials by measuring the trough-peak relationship in 244 individuals with isolated systolic hypertension (> or = 60 years) enrolled in the placebo-controlled systolic hypertension in the European trial. Net treatment effects were calculated by subtracting the mean changes from baseline during placebo (n = 133) from those during active treatment (n = 111). On admission, systolic/diastolic pressures averaged 176/86 mm Hg on clinic and 149/80 mm Hg on 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. With corrections applied to baseline and placebo, nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg/d), with the possible addition of enalapril (5 to 20 mg/d) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg/d), reduced (P < 0.001). 001) these blood pressure values at 16.6/7.3 and 9.8/4.7 mm Hg, respectively. Net trough-to-peak ratios were first determined from blood pressure profiles (12 hours) to the nearest 1 hour, gated by double-blind morning and evening drug doses. Consistent with the usual approach, without accounting for interindividual variability, the net trough-to-peak systolic/diastolic ratios were 0.46/0.40 in the morning and 0.77/0.99 in the evening. In individual subjects, the adjusted baseline minimum-maximum ratios were not normally distributed. Therefore, we used a nonparametric technique to calculate the net trough-to-peak ratios from the results in individual subjects. In the morning, these ratios averaged 0.25 systolic (95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.41) and 0.15 diastolic (95% confidence interval, 0.00 to 0.31), and by at night, 0.19 and 0.36 (95% confidence intervals, 0.00 to 0.38 and 0.14 to 0.56), respectively. When blood pressure profiles were smoothed by substituting 1-hour averages for 2-hour moving or fixed averages or by Fourier modeling, trough-to-peak ratios remained unchanged after the morning dose (0.20/ 0.13, 0.20/0.14, and 0.16/0.21, respectively) but tended to increase at night (0.32/0.38, 0.28/0.40, and 0.48/ 0.49). In conclusion, the proposed parallel group analysis makes it possible to correct the minimum-maximum relationship for both baseline and placebo, to account for interindividual variability, and to calculate a confidence interval for the net minimum-maximum relationship. . relationship. Accounting for interindividual variability reduces the minimum-maximum ratio. Smoothing affects individualized net min-to-max ratios in an unpredictable way and should therefore be avoided.",0,0

In this multicentre study, the efficacy and tolerability of perindopril added to continued hydrochlorothiazide treatment in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (stages I and II) were evaluated. Two hundred and fifty-two patients with supine diastolic blood pressure of 95 mmHg to 114 mmHg were treated for 4 weeks with open-label hydrochlorothiazide at 25 mg/day. The 208 patients whose supine diastolic blood pressure was > or = 90 mmHg at the end of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy entered a 12-week double-blind treatment, in which placebo or perindopril was added to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day therapy. hydrochlorothiazide as follows: placebo (n = 50) and perindopril doses of 2 mg/day (n = 52), 4 mg/day (n = 53), and 8 mg/day (n = 53). Perindopril-hydrochlorothiazide combinations reduced both supine systolic blood pressure and supine diastolic blood pressure by 10.3/6.7, 9.6/8.0, and 9.3/6.3 mmHg, for perindopril doses of 2, 4, and 8 mg/day, respectively; there was no difference between the three drug groups.

A report from the AIRE study investigators.,,"Cleland, J G; Erhardt, L; Murray, G; Hall, A S; Ball, S G","The importance of the effects of ACE inhibitors on sudden death, progressive heart failure, and recurrent infarction for the reduction of overall mortality in heart failure and after myocardial infarction is questioned.; The AIRE study randomly assigned 2,006 patients with clinical or radiological evidence of heart failure within 2 to 9 days after myocardial infarction to receive ramipiril 5 mg twice daily or matching placebo. Results were independently assessed by members of an endpoint committee blinded to treatment allocation; Fewer patients developed severe refractory heart failure as their first validated endpoint with rampril, despite a greater number of survivors at risk, compared with placebo (n=143 vs 178; risk reduction 23% CI 5 to 39 %, P = 0.017). Ramipril did not alter the rate of reinfarction or stroke. Regardless of treatment assignment, 182 (46%) patients developed refractory heart failure before death. Validated acute or remote myocardial reinfarction occurred in 76 (19%) patients prior to death and chest pain occurred in 90 (23%) patients around the time of death, suggesting an ischemic element in these deaths Occurred 80 deaths at index admission, 167 during readmission, and 145 out of hospital. Sudden death accounted for 54% of all deaths and 93% of out-of-hospital deaths. Ramipril reduced the risk of sudden death by 30% (95% CI: 8-47%; P = 0.011). However, overall, 45% of patients who died suddenly had severe or worsening heart failure before death. Only 39% of sudden deaths were considered to be due to arrhythmias. Ramipril reduced the risk of death from circulatory failure by 18%, but this did not reach statistical significance (95% CI, 41 to -14%; P = 0.237). The magnitude of the effects on sudden death and death from circulatory failure were not significantly different. However, 38% of the reduction in overall mortality came from the subgroup with sudden death who had developed prior severe refractory heart failure (placebo n = 35, ramipril n = 15), again emphasizing the marked benefit in prevention of failures. Ramipril did not selectively alter the ratio of deaths in and out of hospital.; Ramipril reduces mortality and progression to resistant heart failure in patients with evidence of heart failure shortly after myocardial infarction. Slowing the progression of heart failure appears to be an important factor that contributes to reducing mortality both by reducing circulatory failure and by reducing sudden death.",1,1

Porcine endothelial cells were isolated from the thoracic aorta, pulmonary artery, and vena cava. Studies were performed with cells from the first subculture. ET concentrations were measured radioimmunologically. Changes in [Ca2+]i were determined with the fluorescent probe fura-2. Cytotoxicity was assessed by the 3'-[1-(phenyl-amino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene (XTT) sodium sulfonic acid hydrate assay. ET synthesis was similar in cells of different vascular origins and was time dependent, reaching approximately 2 pmol ET/mg protein within 12 h of incubation. EPO (12 to 200 U/mL) stimulated ET release in a time- and dose-dependent manner by up to 83.2% (P < 0.01) within 12 h in the absence of fetal calf serum and heparin. EPO induced an immediate significant increase in [Ca2+]i from 58 +/- 12 nmol/L to 495 +/- 85 nmol/L (P < 0.01) with a subsequent slow return to 257 +/- 3 nmol/L. L. During 2 h of incubation, Ca-ionophore A 23187 (10(-8) mol/L) moderately but significantly stimulated endothelial ET synthesis. However, the Ca channel blocker verapamil, the intracellular Ca release blocker TMB-8, and nickel, a nonspecific calcium channel blocker, did not have consistent effects on [Ca2+]io ET synthesis. The protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 stimulated basal and cellular [Ca2+]i synthesis. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein suppressed the EPO-induced increase in [Ca2+]i and cellular ET synthesis. From these data, we conclude that EPO can stimulate ET synthesis in vascular endothelial cells through activation of an EPO receptor and through intracellular signaling mechanisms involving tyrosine kinase activation and an increase in [Ca2+] i. Thus, the systemic hypertensive effects of EPO may be due, at least in part, to local stimulation of vascular endothelial ET synthesis via calcium mobilization.",0,0
2089,9057069,Early treatment with captopril reduces plasma endothelin concentrations in the acute and subacute phases of myocardial infarction: a pilot study.,,"Di Pasquale, P; Valdes, L; Albano, V; Bucca, V; Scalzo, S; Pieri, D; Maringhini, G; Paterna, S","Endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been reported to be increased in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Experimental studies showed that the administration of captopril reduces the secretion of ET-1. In addition, elevated ET-1 levels have been reported to be a negative prognostic index. The study sought to verify whether captopril can reduce plasma ET levels in the acute and subacute phases of anterior reperfused AMI. Forty-five patients, hospitalized for suspected anterior AMI within 4 h from symptom onset, eligible for thrombolysis (first episode), Killip class I-2, were randomized (double-blind) into two groups: group A ( 23; seven women/16 men) received captopril (as the first dose) 2-4 h after starting thrombolysis (the dose was then increased to 25 mg every 8 h). Group B (22; 5 women/17 men) received placebo after thrombolysis. All patients met the reperfusion criteria. The two groups were similar in terms of age, sex, peak CK, ejection fraction, end-systolic volume, and risk factors. Plasma ET levels were measured at admission and 2, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after starting thrombolysis. Mean ET concentrations +/- SD: Baseline Group A, 1.50 +/- 0.67; at 2h, 2.31 +/- 1.24; 12h, 1.84 +/- 1.45; 24h, 1.30 +/- 0.72; 48h, 0.95 +/- 0.50; 72h, 0.60 +/- 0.15 fmol/mL; p < 0.001. Baseline Group B, 1.58 +/- 0.83; at 2 hours, 2.38 +/- 1.35; 12h, 2.33 +/- 1.71; 24h, 1.80 +/- 1.41; 48h, 1.46 +/- 0.88; 72h, 0.93 +/- 0.44 fmol/mL; p < 0.001. The difference between the two groups was significant at the beginning of the test (between 2 and 12 h, p[=]0.002). Subsequently, plasma endothelin values decreased in parallel, p < 0.001. Our data suggest that captopril affects plasma ET levels in the acute and subacute phases of AMI. Furthermore, these results provide further evidence of a beneficial effect of early treatment with captopril.",0,0

The current study, the Nisoldipine Enalapril Anterior Myocardial Infarction Pilot Investigation Study, was designed to investigate the effects of 12 weeks of treatment with enalapril or nisoldipine or their combination on left ventricular (LV) function and exercise capacity in patients with heart failure. recent cardiac arrest (< 1 month). ) anterior myocardial infarction and mild LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction [EF] 38% to 48%). Forty-six patients were studied and received, by random assignment, enalapril (5 mg once daily) plus placebo (n = 14) or nisoldipine (10 mg twice daily) plus placebo (n = 18) or enalapril (5 mg once daily) plus nisoldipine (10 mg twice daily) (n = 14). All patients received aspirin (325 mg) throughout the study. Data on LV EF and maximal filling rate at rest and LV EF during exercise were collected during radionuclide ventriculography. In addition, the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure (rate-pressure product) and exercise time were determined during the stress test. The parameters analyzed did not change significantly after treatment with enalapril or nisoldipine. In contrast, the combination of enalapril and nisoldipine significantly increased LVEF at rest (from 43% +/- 3% to 48% +/- 6%, p < 0.01) and during exercise (from 45% +/- 3%). /- 8% to 50% +/- 9%, p < 0.01) and increased the maximum resting rate of filling (end-diastolic volume fraction per second) from 1.57 +/- 0.3 to 1.67 +/- 0.3 (p < 0.05). In addition, the combined administration of the two drugs increased the rate-pressure product (values x 10(3)) (from 20.7 +/- 5 to 22.7 +/- 4, p < 0.05) and increased the exercise time (from 573 +/- 173 seconds to 668 +/- 178 seconds, p < 0.05).

2092,9061270,Lisinopril. A review of its pharmacology and clinical efficacy in elderly patients.,,"Langtry, H D; Markham, A","Lisinopril, the lysine analog of enalaprilat, is a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that is administered once daily orally. The efficacy of lisinopril in lowering blood pressure is well established in younger populations, and many trials now show that it is effective in lowering blood pressure in elderly patients with hypertension. In comparative and noncomparative clinical trials, 68.2 to 89.1% of elderly patients responded (diastolic pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) to > or = 8 weeks of treatment with lisinopril. Age-related differences in antihypertensive efficacy do not appear to be clinically significant, and effective doses in elderly patients tend to range from 2.5 to 40 mg/day. Doses should generally be lower in patients with significant renal insufficiency. In congestive heart failure, lisinopril 2.5 to 20 mg/day increases exercise duration, improves left ventricular ejection fraction, and has no significant effect on ventricular ectopic beats. It is similar in efficacy to enalapril and digoxin and similar or superior to captopril in most endpoints. Data from the GISSI-3 post-myocardial infarction trial show that lisinopril reduced mortality and left ventricular dysfunction when administered for 42 days beginning 24 hours after the onset of myocardial infarction symptoms. Results at 6 weeks and 6 months were similar in elderly and younger patients. Elderly patients, however, among other subgroups, exhibited a strong reduction in the risk of low ejection fraction after treatment (-25.5%). Economic studies suggest that lisinopril is cost-saving compared to other ACE inhibitors in some markets. When administered according to the GISSI-3 protocol, lisinopril appears to be one of the least expensive successful ACE inhibitor regimens for acute myocardial infarction. In other trials, patients with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension improved or did not worsen during treatment with lisinopril. Blood pressure was monitored and reductions or trends toward reductions in albuminuria were noted. These reductions were similar to those who received diltiazem, nifedipine, and verapamil, and greater than those who received atenolol. Lisinopril appears to reduce mortality in diabetic patients after myocardial infarction and may also improve neuropathy associated with diabetes. Lisinopril is well tolerated and the observed adverse event profile is typical for ACE inhibitors as a class. There is a trend for more elderly than younger patients to discontinue treatment, but this trend is not clearly related to the incidence of adverse events in these age groups. Drug interactions occur with few other agents and are generally clinically significant only between lisinopril and diuretics or lithium. Lisinopril is therefore an effective treatment for elderly patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure and acute myocardial infarction and has shown promising benefits in patients with diabetic nephropathy.",0,0

2094,9067912,A drop in glomerular filtration rate induced by short-term antihypertensive treatment predicts long-term stability of renal function.,,"Apperloo, A J; de Zeeuw, D; de Jong, P E","In long-term interventional studies of renal function outcome, an initial decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may occur after starting therapy. If this initial decrease in GFR is the result of a treatment-induced haemodynamic change reflecting a drop in intraglomerular pressure, it should be reversible after discontinuation of treatment, even after long-term treatment. In fact, it could be beneficial for long-term kidney function. Therefore, we studied systemic and renal hemodynamics in 40 nondiabetic patients with renal insufficiency before treatment, during four years of treatment with atenolol or enalapril, and after discontinuation of that treatment. The acute change in GFR 12 weeks after initiation of treatment ranged widely from -11 to +11 mL/min (mean +/- SD -1.0 +/- 4.1 mL/min, NS). After four years of treatment, discontinuation for 12 weeks resulted in an increase in GFR of +2.2 +/- 5.4 mL/min, P = 0.011, again with a wide range of +14 to -6 mL /min). The initial drop in GFR was related to the increase after withdrawal (r = 0.32, P < 0.05). Interestingly, the acute treatment-induced change in GFR correlated with the long-term slope, such that a patient with a greater initial decline in GFR showed a more stable course during follow-up (r = -0.36, P < 0.05). Patients were arbitrarily divided into group A (N = 20), with the largest initial drop in GFR induced by treatment, and group B (N = 20), with the smallest initial drop in GFR. Group A had a significantly less steep slope than Group B (-0.41 +/- 1.52 vs. -2.09 +/- 2.79 mL/min/year, P = 0.023) over all four years. of follow up. In group A, GFR increased again after treatment withdrawal (+3.8 +/- 5.6 ml/min, P = 0.011) while in group B it did not change (+0.5 +/- 4.0 mL/min, NS). As a consequence, post-treatment GFR was not different compared to pre-treatment in group A (-2.5 +/- 7.2 ml/min, NS), while it was 5.9 +/- 12.1 ml/min. min lower in group B (P = 0.023). Patients treated with enalapril had a similar response to patients treated with atenolol. In conclusion, an initial drop in GFR after starting antihypertensive treatment in patients with mild to moderate renal failure (GFR 30 to 90 ml/min) is reversible even after years of treatment, suggesting that this induced drop by therapy is of hemodynamic type and not of structural origin. This initial drop in GFR was associated with subsequent stable renal function. These data lead to the hypothesis that the initial drop in GFR in response to antihypertensive therapy reflects renal protection.",0,0
2095,9068723,Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angioedema.,,"Sabroe, R A; Black, A K","Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are increasingly used for the treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure, and reduce mortality when administered after myocardial infarction. Of patients prescribed these drugs, 0.1-0.7% develop angioedema, but the association is not widely recognized. In 60% of cases, the onset occurs during the first week of treatment; however, it may be significantly delayed. Angioedema almost always occurs in the head and neck, often involving the mouth, tongue, pharynx, and larynx. The course is unpredictable and attacks vary in severity from mild to fatal due to laryngeal obstruction. Severe ACEi-induced angioedema may require emergency treatment with epinephrine and early intubation. The drug should be withdrawn in any patient who develops ACEi-induced angioedema and treatment continued with an appropriate drug from a different class. ACE inhibitor therapy is contraindicated in patients with a history of idiopathic angioedema or in patients with hereditary or acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency.",0,0

Verapamil prevents cardiac events after AMI in patients without CHF. We hypothesized that in CHF patients who have had a heart attack and who were prescribed diuretics and an ACE inhibitor, additional treatment with verapamil may reduce the rate of cardiac events. In this multicenter, double-blind study, CHF patients receiving diuretic therapy were consecutively randomized to treatment with trandolapril 1 mg/day for 1 month and 2 mg/day for the next 2 months (n = 49), or trandolapril as indicated. mentioned plus verapamil 240 mg/day for 1 month and 360 mg/day for 2 months (n = 51).

The primary endpoint was the tolerability measure of a persistent increase in serum creatinine of 26.5 mumol/L or greater (> or = 0.3 mg/dL) during therapy; the secondary endpoint was the composite of death and/or hospital admission for heart failure; and other measures of efficacy were total mortality, admission for heart failure, NYHA class, and admission for myocardial infarction or unstable angina; The frequency of persistent increases in serum creatinine was the same in both groups (10.5%). Fewer patients on losartan discontinued treatment due to adverse experiences (12.2% vs. 20.8% on captopril, p = 0.002). No losartan-treated patients discontinued treatment due to cough compared to 14 in the captopril group. Death and/or hospital admission for heart failure was recorded in 9.4% of patients who received losartan and 13.2% of those who received captopril (32% risk reduction [95% CI: -4% to +55%], p = 0.075). This risk reduction was primarily due to a decrease in all-cause mortality (4.8% vs. 8.7%; 46% risk reduction [95% CI: 5-69%], p = 0.035 ). Admissions for heart failure were the same in both groups (5.7%), as was the improvement in NYHA functional class from baseline. Hospital admissions for any reason were less frequent with losartan than with captopril (22.2% vs. 29.7%); In this study of elderly patients with heart failure, treatment with losartan was associated with lower unexpected mortality than was found with captopril.

A 36-week, open-label, randomized, controlled, multicentre study involving 189 physicians and 69 nurses was conducted in 155 primary health care and occupational health care centers in Finland. The study population consisted of 1156 patients, 30 to 70 years of age (mean DBP 95 to 115 mmHg in the last three to five measurements during follow-up). The number of patients achieving target pressure (DBP < 90 mmHg) at the end of the study, defined daily doses (DDDs) of antihypertensive medications, and side effects in different treatment groups were considered as the main study outcome measures. After exclusions and dropouts, the final analysis was performed with 900 patients, 419 women (46.6%) and 481 men (53.4%). Patients who received lisinopril treatment achieved target pressure significantly more often (p < 0.001) than those who continued their previous or adjusted medication at 36 weeks (59.2 and 55.5% vs. 40.3 and 42 .7%).

Acute myocardial ischemia superimposed on ventricles damaged by previous infarctions has been shown to increase the generation of lethal ventricular arrhythmias. This is a retrospective analysis of 6797 participants in studies of prevention and treatment of left ventricular dysfunction. Both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to study the association of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy with the risk of sudden cardiac death. The following covariates were adjusted for in the analysis: age, ejection fraction, gender, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, history of angina, prior infarction, prior revascularization, and regular use of beta-blockers, diuretics, digoxin, antiarrhythmic agents, or enalapril. . The overall incidence of sudden cardiac death per 100 patient-years of follow-up was 2.24%. On multivariate analysis, antiplatelet and anticoagulant monotherapy remained independently associated with a reduction in the risk of sudden cardiac death: antiplatelet therapy with a 24% reduction (relative risk [RR] 0.76; confidence interval [CI ] of 95% 0.61-0.95) and antiplatelet monotherapy with a reduction of 32% (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.48-0.96). Therefore, in patients with moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction as a result of coronary artery disease, antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy are associated with a reduced risk of sudden cardiac death.",0,0

This document describes an attempt to address this difficulty. ACE activity in serum and non-centrifuged skeletal muscle homogenates was measured with a fluorometric assay before and during treatment in 24 fosinopril-treated and 26 atenolol-treated hypertensives. The absolute difference in activity between the highest and lowest of two different sample dilutions divided by the mean activity was taken to represent competitive inhibition in the sample, ""inhibitor index"". The reduction in muscle ACE activity coincident with fosinopril treatment was not statistically significant (-2.6%, p = 0.68). However, the inhibitor index increased by 46% (p=0.045) and no change was observed in the atenolol-treated group (-12%, p=0.51). The change in muscle inhibitor index (but not the reduction in serum ACE activity) was inversely correlated with the change in blood pressure (r = -0.50, p = 0.034) and serum aldosterone ( r = -0.54, p = 0.031) in the fosinopril group. group, but not in the atenolol group. In a second study, the serum inhibitor index increased by 0.28 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.32) in 12 patients treated with trandolapril, but was unchanged in 11 patients treated with atenolol (+0, 0097, 95% CI -0.029 to 0.048).

We hypothesize that ACE inhibitors improve lung function in chronic heart failure (CHF) by readjusting the tone and patency of pulmonary vessels or alveolar-capillary membrane diffusion.; In 16 patients with CHF and 16 untreated normal or mildly hypertensive volunteers, lung function and exercise tests with respiratory gas analysis were assessed with placebo, enalapril (10 mg twice daily), enalapril plus aspirin (325 mg/day). d) or aspirin, in random order. and double blind, for 15 days each. In CHF, enalapril increased pulmonary diffusion of carbon monoxide (DLCO), oxygen consumption (VO2), and exercise tolerance and decreased dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) and ventilatory equivalent for the production of carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2) . With enalapril, changes in VO2 (r = 0.80, P < 0.0001) and VD/VT (r = -0.69, P = 0.003) for placebo correlated with those for DLCO. These effects were inhibited by aspirin and were absent in control subjects. In an additional 8 patients, hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate, as an alternative treatment to reduce pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and increase exercise capacity, was more effective than enalapril for PCWP but did not affect DLCO and VE/VCO2; the improvement in VO2 and VD/VT was not related to DLCO and was not modified by aspirin; ACE inhibition improved lung diffusion in CHF. Hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate did not provide this result.

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 39 physically active men with uncomplicated essential hypertension, we compared the effects of atenolol and enalapril on cardiovascular fitness and serum lipids. The drugs (atenolol, 50 or 100 mg once daily; enalapril, 10 or 20 mg once daily) were each administered for 4 weeks, and each period of active drug was preceded by 4 weeks of placebo therapy. Both drugs effectively (p < 0.001) lowered resting blood pressure when measured at theoretical peak (ie, 3 to 4 hours after drug) and trough (ie, 24 hours after drug) levels. drug blood vessels. Atenolol reduced maximal oxygen consumption (by 7.3%, p < 0.001) 3 to 4, but not 24 hours after drug ingestion; no changes occurred with enalapril.

We also analyzed changes in left ventricular volumes after study drug withdrawal. Reducing left ventricular dilatation is one of the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition after AMI. However, the nature of this effect is not fully understood.; Eighty-nine patients were included within 48 hours after the onset of a first AMI and a left ventricular ejection fraction with radionuclides less than 45%. The study was double-blind and compared enalapril and placebo in a crossover design. All patients were randomly assigned to sequence A (enalapril, 45 days; placebo, 45 days) or B (placebo, 45 days; enalapril, 45 days). The end point was the change in volume of the left ventricle at 45 and 90 days. Thrombolysis was administered to 26 patients (70%) in group A and 25 (75%) in group B. All clinical variables prior to treatment were similar in both groups. Median and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for left ventricular diastolic volumes were 46.8 mL/m2 (39 to 61 mL/m2) and 46.6 mL/m2 (39 to 60 mL/m2) for groups A and B, respectively. Baseline end-systolic volumes were 28.5 mL/m2 (20 to 36 mL/m2) and 28.9 mL/m2 (23 to 28 mL/m2) in the same groups. Placebo treatment for the initial 45 days was associated with an increase in left ventricular diastolic volume of 8.75 mL/m2 (95% CI, 3.25 to 17.1 mL/m2; P < .01) and an end-systolic volume of 4.20 mL/m2 (95% CI, 0.00 to 10.1 mL/m2, p < 0.05).

Thirteen regular smoking volunteers were studied in a randomized, single-dose, double-blind, crossover fashion using captopril 50 mg versus placebo followed by smoking two high-nicotine cigarettes in 15 min. Blood samples were obtained at frequent intervals before, during, and after smoking. We found that the increase in plasma epinephrine concentration during cigarette smoking was modest. There was no difference between captopril treatment compared to placebo. Thus, the epinephrine response to smoking was not attenuated by acute blockade of angiotensin II generation. A significant increase in heart rate and blood pressure was also found. No increase in plasma norepinephrine concentration was found. Plasma renin concentration increased significantly during captopril treatment, while it decreased throughout the study period in the placebo phase. Plasma angiotensin II concentration decreased in both the captopril and placebo phases throughout the study period, but this was more pronounced during captopril treatment. In conclusion, smoking-induced sympathetic nervous system activation was not blunted by acute ACE inhibition by captopril. This indicates that angiotensin II does not facilitate smoking-induced activation of sympathoadrenal activity in humans.",0,0

However, it is unknown whether PAA predicts the development or regression of organ damage over time better than clinical PA.; In 206 essential hypertensive subjects with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), we measured clinical supine BP, 24-hour PAA, and left ventricular mass index (LVMI, echocardiography) before and after 12 months of treatment with lisinopril (20 mg UID) without or with hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 or 25 mg UID). Measurements included random zero, clinical and home orthostatic pressure. In total, 184 subjects completed the 12-month treatment period. Before treatment, clinical supine BP was 165 +/- 15/105 +/- 5 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic), mean 24-hour BP was 149 +/- 16/95 +/- 11 mm Hg and the LVMI was 158 +/- 32 g/m2.

Before treatment, LVMI did not correlate with clinical BP, but was correlated with mean 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP (r = 0.34/0.27, P < 0.01). LVMI reduction was not related to clinical BP reduction, but was related to mean 24-hour BP reduction (r = 0.42/0.38, p < 0.01). Treatment-induced changes in mean daytime and nighttime BP correlated with changes in LVMI as strongly as changes in 24-hour BP. No substantial advantage over supine clinical BP was demonstrated with orthostatic, random zero, and home clinical BP; In hypertensive subjects with LVH, LVH regression was much more accurately predicted by treatment-induced changes in BP than by clinical BP.

Eleven patients with hypertension, who had developed cough induced by ACE inhibitors, a TXA2 synthetase inhibitor, were given ozagrel for 1 to 2 months along with the ACE inhibitors. One patient developed ozagrel-induced headache and was removed from the study after 3 weeks. In another 10 patients, no obvious drug-attributable abnormalities were observed in subjective and objective symptoms or laboratory tests. In ten patients, cough scores were taken just before and after administration of a combination of an ACE inhibitor with ozagrel.

In patients with myocardial infarction (MI), early treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is controversial. In hypotensive patients, initiation of treatment may exacerbate myocardial ischemia and thus affect clinical outcome. Thus, in the CONSENSUS II study, a total of 60 patients randomly assigned to treatment with intravenous enalapril or placebo starting within 24 h of MI onset were assessed by repeated blood pressure measurements, ambulatory segment monitoring ST before discharge and stress tests. Significant ST depression was present in 34 patients.

Furthermore, the number of recurrent acute ischemic events during follow-up was higher in these patients (7 vs. 1; p < 0.01). Ten of the enalapril-treated patients showed long-lasting ST depression versus only 3 in the placebo group (p = 0.08), and the mean duration of all significant ST depressions during Holter monitoring was significantly longer in the enalapril group compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05). Finally, 7 enalapril patients (20%) suffered an acute ischemic event versus 1 patient (4%) in the placebo group (p = 0.07). In conclusion, early administration of enalapril had a potential pro-ischemic effect in patients prone to hypotension mediated by exacerbation of the hemodynamic response, since the initial drop in blood pressure after MI is related to residual myocardial ischemia and acute ischemic syndromes. recurring.",0,0

Lisinopril tended to lower BP more than enalapril, but only achieved office systolic BP (SBP) reduction (p = 0.0062), 24-h SBP load (P = 0, 0182) and nocturnal SBP load (P = 0.0316). statistical significance.

This study compares the efficacy and safety of moexipril plus HCTZ with that of standard combination therapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. After a 1-month placebo run-in period, 140 hypertensive patients whose sitting diastolic BP (DBP) averaged 95-114 mm Hg were randomized to receive either moexipril 7.5 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg once daily or metoprolol. 100 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg for after a 12-week double-blind treatment period. At biweekly visits, BP was controlled sphygmomanometrically and the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) was documented. At the end of the study, the adjusted mean reductions in sitting systolic/diastolic BP observed with both combinations were -17.6 mm Hg/-12.8 mm Hg and -17.2 mm Hg/-13.9 mm Hg in the moexipril/HCTZ and metoprolol/HCTZ groups, respectively. The response rate to both types of combinations was very similar, 69% and 74% in the moexipril/HCTZ and metoprolol/HCTZ groups, respectively. The percentage of patients who experienced one or more AEs was 46% in the moexipril/HCTZ group and 61% in the metoprolol/HCTZ group. Headache and cough, which are the most frequently reported adverse events after ACE inhibitor treatment, were observed in 9% and 10% of patients in the moexipril/HCTZ group compared to 10%. % and 4% in the metoprolol/HCTZ group.

The aim of this observational study was to investigate whether additional benefits can be obtained from beta-blockade in a population with heart failure already receiving high-dose ACE inhibitor therapy. Atenolol is a long-acting cardioselective beta-blocking agent and lacks additional vasodilatory properties. Twenty-five male patients with class II or III heart failure and background therapy with digitalis, furosemide, and fosinopril 20 mg daily were treated with fosinopril 40 mg daily and an additional atenolol 75 mg daily (beta-blocker group) or with 40 mg of fosinopril daily. fosinopril per day alone (control group). At the end of one year, changes in left ventricular function, exercise parameters, and plasma neurohumoral variables reflecting vasoconstriction (norepinephrine, large endothelin) were measured and compared in the two treatment groups. Nineteen patients completed the study. Dropouts were due to death (4 patients) and noncompliance (2 patients) with no significant difference between groups. There was a beta-blocker-related improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.05 between groups) and an increase in maximal oxygen consumption only in the control group (p < 0.05 between groups).

With the aim of preventing MR progression, a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted. It measured the efficacy of lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in reducing echocardiographic signs of MR severity over a one-year period. Severe coronary artery disease was excluded by stress echocardiography. Treatment efficacy was estimated to be proportional to the reduction in MI fraction and cardiac chamber dimensions, compared to baseline, based on intention-to-treat analysis. A final patient population of 23 asymptomatic adults aged 53.3 +/- 2.4 years (mean +/- SEM), with moderate organic MR and normal left ventricular function, was selected from the echocardiographic database. All baseline patient characteristics were comparable in the two treatment groups, including the MR fraction (55 +/- 3%). Twelve patients received lisinopril (18 +/- 1 mg) and 11 received placebo. After one year of treatment, a statistically significant difference in the MR fraction was observed between the two groups. For the lisinopril group, the MR fraction was reduced by 6.4 +/- 3.5% and for the placebo group it was increased by 3.7 +/- 3.2% from baseline (p < 0.05). No differences were observed in the dimensions of the left atrium or left ventricle. Study drug was discontinued in four patients after one patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation and angina, while three patients did not tolerate lisinopril. Only one patient who received placebo dropped out of therapy. In conclusion, treatment with lisinopril indicates some reduction in the severity of moderate chronic mitral regurgitation in asymptomatic patients with normal left ventricular function.

2147,9179532,Lisinopril. A review of its pharmacology and use in the management of complications of diabetes mellitus.,,"Goa, K L; Haria, M; Wilde, M I","Lisinopril, like other ACE inhibitors, lowers blood pressure and preserves renal function in hypertensive patients with insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM or IDDM) and early or overt kidney disease, without adversely affecting glycemic control or renal profiles. of lipids. Based on the available evidence, the renoprotective effects appear to be greater with lisinopril than with comparator calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and beta-blockers, despite similar antihypertensive efficacy. As shown by the EUCLID trial (EUrodiab Controlled trial of Lisinopril in Insulin-Dependent Diabetes), lisinopril is also renoprotective in normotensive patients with IDDM and microalbuminuria. The effect in normotensive patients with normoalbuminuria was less than in those with microalbuminuria, and no conclusions can yet be drawn about its use in patients with normoalbuminuria. In complications other than kidney disease, lisinopril has shown some benefit. Progression to retinopathy was slowed during 2 years of lisinopril treatment in the EUCLID study. Although not yet fully published, these results provide the most convincing evidence to date for the effect of an ACE inhibitor on retinopathy. The drug may also improve neurological function, but this finding is preliminary. Finally, post hoc analysis of the GISSI-3 trial indicates that lisinopril reduces mortality rates at 6 weeks in diabetic patients when started as early treatment after acute myocardial infarction. The tolerability profile of lisinopril is typical of ACE inhibitors and appears to be similar in diabetics and non-diabetics. Hypoglycaemia has occurred with similar frequency with lisinopril and placebo, as shown in the EUCLID trial. In addition, the GISSI-3 study indicates that the incidence of persistent hypotension and renal dysfunction is increased with lisinopril in general, but the presence of diabetes does not seem to confer an additional risk of these events in diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarction receiving lisinopril. In summary, lisinopril lowers blood pressure and produces a renoprotective effect in IDDM and NIDDM patients without detriment to glycemic control or lipid profile. Like other ACE inhibitors, lisinopril should be considered as a first-line agent for lowering blood pressure and preventing or attenuating nephropathy in hypertensive diabetic patients with IDDM or NIDDM and microalbuminuria or overt renal disease. The EUCLID study, using lisinopril, provides new data supporting an additional place in the management of normotensive patients with microalbuminuria and IDDM. These findings, together with some evidence of an effect of lisinopril in slowing the progression of retinopathy and reducing mortality, suggest a broader role for the drug in the management of diabetic vascular complications.",0,0

In outpatient clinics of university medical centers, 27 older hypertensive patients (> or =45 years; 12 black, 15 non-black; 19 men, 8 women) with DBP of 95 mm Hg or greater and creatinine clearance at 4 hours of 20 at 70 ml/min/1.73 m2 were studied. Changes (delta) from baseline in BP, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and renal plasma flow (RPF) were measured. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP decreased significantly and to a similar degree in the randomized groups: fosinopril (mean +/- SEM) delta DBP at 6 weeks was -13 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001 95% CI, -16 to -9) and at 22 weeks it was -12 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001, 95% CI, -16 to -9); lisinopril delta DBP at 6 weeks was -14 +/- 6 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -10 to -18) and at 22 weeks it was -16 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -12 to -21). GFR and RPF did not change significantly in either group. BP decreased significantly and to a similar degree in blacks and nonblacks: for blacks, delta DBP at 6 weeks was -11 +/- 3 (P < 0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 at -9) and at 22 weeks it was -16 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -11 to -20); for nonblacks, delta DBP at 6 weeks was -14 +/- 1 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -12 to -17) and at 22 weeks it was -12 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -16 to -8). Eight patients (five black and three non-black) required an addition of furosemide after 6 weeks to achieve goal DBP of < or = 90 mm Hg at 22 weeks. GFR was not significantly altered for any of the racial groups at 6 weeks; however, at 22 weeks; however, at 22 weeks, GFR decreased significantly in blacks (delta GFR, -16 +/- 5; P < .006; 95% CI, -26 to -5) and tended to increase in nonblacks ( delta GFR, 7 +/- 6, p > 0.25). delta GFR was directly correlated with delta FPR (delta GFR = 0.0611* delta FPR -2.35 +, r = 0.68, P < 0.003). There was no correlation between delta MAP and delta GFR or delta RPF in blacks or non-blacks. We conclude that chronic ACE inhibition with fosinopril and lisinopril alone or in combination with furosemide lowers BP in older blacks and non-blacks with hypertension and chronic renal failure. Racial differences in renal hemodynamic response to chronic ACE inhibition were observed and appear to be independent of diuretic use and magnitude of BP lowering.",0,0

Aspirin (ASA) has become a well-documented therapeutic adjunct in patients with coronary heart disease. Recently, attention has focused on a possible interaction between ASA and ACE inhibitors. Therefore, we reanalyzed data from the Cooperative New Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study II (CONSENSUS II) to find any evidence of differential effects of the ACE inhibitor enalapril in subgroups defined by ASA use at baseline. Logistic regression tested multiplicative interaction. We use the Rothman synergy index S, which would be equal to unity under additivity, and less than unity when suggesting antagonism, to examine the postulated interaction with deviation from an additive model. Logistic regression showed that the interaction term enalapril-ASA was a significant predictor of mortality at the end of the study (p = 0.047), and was a significant predictor of borderline mortality 30 days after randomization (p = 0.085). The Rothman S synergy index was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.94) for mortality at the end of the study and 0.68 (0.44 to 1.04) for mortality at 30 days, indicating antagonism between enalapril and ASA with deviation from an additive model. Therefore, we found evidence of enalapril-ASA interaction. The effect of enalapril was less favorable among patients taking ASA than among patients not taking ASA at baseline.",0,0

An initial group of low-dose ramipril (0.625 mg) was also evaluated. Clinical events did not differ. During the first 14 days, the risk of developing a systolic blood pressure of < or = 90 mm Hg was increased in both ramipril groups. LVEF increased in all groups during this period, but the early full-dose ramipril group had the greatest improvement in EF (increase: full, 4.9 +/- 10.0; low, 3.9 +/- 8.2%, late 2.4 +/- 8.8%, P for trend < 0.05) and was the only group that did not demonstrate a significant increase in LV diastolic area; The results of the present study demonstrated that in patients with prior MI, early use of ramipril (titrated to 10 mg) attenuated LV remodeling and was associated with faster LVEF recovery. Use of the low-dose regimen did not prevent hypotension and had only intermediate benefits on LV size and function. The more favorable effects on LV topography of early use of full doses of ramipril support the results of major clinical trials, which have shown an early survival benefit of ACE inhibition.",0,0

Clinical pharmacokinetics and clinical potential.,,"Shionoiri, H; Naruse, M; Minamisawa, K; Ueda, S; Himeno, H; Hiroto, S; Takasaki, I","Fosinopril is a phosphorous-containing ester prodrug of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It is hydrolyzed primarily in the gastrointestinal mucosa and liver to the active diacid, fosinoprilat, which has unique pharmacological properties. Most of the active fractions of other ACE inhibitors are excreted in the urine. This means that an adjustment in dose and/or dosing interval is necessary in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction to reduce drug accumulation and the possibility of excessive blood pressure lowering or other adverse effects. On the other hand, fosinoprilat is excreted in both urine and bile (as with temocaprilat, zofenoprilat, and spiraprilat), so dose and/or administration interval adjustment may be unnecessary in patients with moderate renal dysfunction. to severe, as impaired renal function has little influence on the pharmacokinetics of fosinoprilat. Furthermore, the available evidence suggests that the pharmacokinetic variables of fosinoprilat in patients receiving hemodialysis were similar to those in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction. Dose modifications or supplemental doses after dialysis may be unnecessary. The hypotensive effect of the combination of fosinopril and a diuretic is synergistic. Pharmacokinetic interactions with fosinopril are unlikely in patients receiving thiazides or loop diuretics. Fosinopril has beneficial effects for patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy because it produces an adequate reduction in blood pressure and reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy. There are a large number of studies on the pharmacokinetics of fosinopril. However, studies of its pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs are much less.

We conducted a prospective, randomized, parallel study for 42 months, double-blind for the first 12 months, and single-blind thereafter. Forty-three (21 lisinopril and 22 atenolol) hypertensive patients with NIDDM and diabetic nephropathy were enrolled. Data from 36 patients (17 lisinopril and 19 atenolol, 60 +/- 7 years of age, 27 male) who completed at least 12 months of the study period are presented. At baseline, the two groups were comparable: glomerular filtration rate (plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA) was 75 +/- 6 and 74 +/- 8 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m( -2), mean 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (A&D TM2420) was 110 +/- 3 and 114 +/- 2 mmHg, and 24-h urinary albumin excretion rate was 961 (range 331- 5727) and 1578 (476-5806) mg/24 h in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. The mean follow-up time was similar, 37 and 35 months in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. Mean ambulatory blood pressure was reduced equally in the two groups, 12 +/- 2 and 10 +/- 2 mmHg in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. Glomerular filtration rate decreased in a biphasic manner with a more rapid baseline change (0 to 6 months) of 1.25 +/- 0.49 and 0.81 +/- 0.29 mL x min(-1) x month (-1) followed by a slower sustained decline (6 to 42 months) of 0.59 +/- 0.10 and 0.54 +/- 0.13 mL x min(-1) x month(-1) in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. No significant differences were observed in the initial or sustained decrease in glomerular filtration rate between the two groups.

Sporadic cases of angioedema secondary to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been reported in the literature. The overall incidence is around 0.1% to 0.2%, and the time of onset is usually during the first week of ACE inhibitor therapy. Late-onset angioedema secondary to ACEI therapy is much more common than believed and is largely unrecognized due to the lack of temporal correlation between ACEI therapy and the development of angioedema. Since angioedema can progress to upper airway obstruction, otolaryngologists should be aware of this association. Most importantly, late-onset angioedema should alert the physician to stop the ACE inhibitor immediately to avoid further morbidity. This report presents an example of late-onset angioedema that was precipitated by taking a double dose of captopril incidentally.

2166,9211084,Fosinopril. A review of its pharmacology and clinical efficacy in the treatment of heart failure.,,"Davis, R; Coukell, A; McTavish, D","Fosinopril is the prodrug of the active diacid ACE inhibitor fosinoprilat. In patients with heart failure, fosinopril reduces pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial pressure, mean right atrial pressure, and heart rate, and increases stroke volume index and cardiac index. The drug has dual compensatory elimination pathways through the renal and hepatic systems and accumulates to a lesser extent than enalapril and lisinopril in patients with chronic renal failure with or without heart failure. Comparative studies of 3 or 6 months duration with fosinopril 10 to 40 mg/day have shown clinical efficacy significantly superior to placebo in patients with heart failure [mainly New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III] . Fosinopril treatment consistently increased exercise duration and improved heart failure symptoms in these patients. Significantly fewer fosinopril than placebo recipients withdrew or were hospitalized due to worsening heart failure. Additionally, significantly more fosinopril than those receiving placebo showed improvement, and fewer patients had deteriorated, in terms of NYHA functional class. Fosinopril and enalapril showed similar clinical efficacy over 6 and 12 months of treatment in patients with NYHA functional class II to IV heart failure. So far, there are no data showing a mortality benefit with fosinopril. Fosinopril was well tolerated in clinical trials in patients with heart failure. Dizziness (11.9 vs. 5.4% for placebo), cough (9.7 vs. 5.1%), and hypotension (4.4 vs. 0.8%) were the most frequently reported adverse events. In comparative studies of 6 or 12 months, treatment with fosinopril was associated with a lower incidence of dizziness and hypotension, but with a higher incidence of vertigo than treatment with enalapril. 0.8% of patients discontinued the drug due to cough, which occurred similarly with fosinopril and enalapril. Therefore, based on the available clinical evidence, fosinopril is an effective and well-tolerated option for the treatment of patients with heart failure. Although clinical data are limited, fosinopril may be especially useful in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency.",0,0

We investigated whether the prostanoid thromboxane was involved; Nine patients with essential hypertension who had cough after enalapril 20 mg once daily (cough) were treated, while continuing enalapril, in a double-blind crossover study with placebo or picotamide 600 mg twice daily. Picotamide is an antiplatelet agent that acts by inhibition of thromboxane synthase and antagonism of the thromboxane receptor. Thirteen hypertensive patients with no history of ACE-I-induced cough were also treated with enalapril and served as controls. Cough frequency was measured using a visual analog scale and a daily cough diary. The 24-h urinary recovery of 11-dehydro-thromboxane-B2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was measured to assess any changes in endoperoxide metabolism during the study periods; Picotamide significantly reduced the recovery of 11-dehydro-thromboxane-B2 (TXB2), resulting in disappearance of cough in eight patients within 72 h. Picotamide urinary recovery data suggested incomplete absorption in non-responders. At baseline and after rechallenge with enalapril, 11-dehydro-TXB2 excretion was in the same range in controls and coughers, but coughers showed significantly less 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion, and their ratio of 11-dehydroTXB2 to 6-keto-PGF1alpha was double that of controls (1.40 [95% CI 0.86-1.95] vs. 0.61 [0.37-0.84] ); A thromboxane antagonist is effective in ACE-I-induced cough. An imbalance between thromboxane and prostacyclin may represent a marker of patients susceptible to ACE-I-induced cough.",0,0
2170,9217756,Randomized placebo-controlled trial of the effect of ramipril on lowering glomerular filtration rate and risk of end-stage renal failure in non-diabetic proteinuric nephropathy. The GISEN Group (Gruppo Italiano di Studi Epidemiologici in Nefrologia),,,"In diabetic nephropathy, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a greater effect than other antihypertensive drugs on proteinuria and the progressive decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It is not clear whether this difference applies to the progression of non-diabetic proteinuric nephropathies. The Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy study of non-diabetic chronic kidney disease aimed to determine if glomerular protein trafficking influences the progression of kidney disease and if an ACE inhibitor was superior to conventional treatment, with the same blood pressure control , to reduce proteinuria, limit the decline in GFR, and prevention of end-stage renal disease.; In this double-blind prospective trial, 352 patients were classified according to baseline proteinuria (stratum 1: 1-3 g/24 h; stratum 2: > or = 3 g/24 h), and randomly assigned to ramipril or placebo plus conventional antihypertensive agent. . therapy aimed at achieving a diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. The primary endpoint was the rate of decline in GFR. Analysis was by intention to treat.; At the second planned interim analysis, the difference in GFR decline between the ramipril and placebo groups in stratum 2 was highly significant (p = 0.001). Therefore, the independent adjudication panel decided to open the randomization code and perform the final analysis on this stratum (stratum 1 continued in the trial). Data (at least three GFR measurements, including baseline) were available for 56 patients assigned to ramipril and 61 patients assigned to placebo. The decrease in GFR per month was significantly less in the ramipril group than in the placebo group (0.53 [0.08] vs. 0.88 [0.13] ml/min, p = 0.03) . Among patients assigned to ramipril, percentage reduction in proteinuria was inversely correlated with decrease in GFR (p = 0.035) and predicted reduced risk of baseline creatinine doubling or end-stage renal failure (18 ramipril vs 40 placebo , p = 0.04). The risk of progression was still significantly reduced after adjustment for changes in systolic (p = 0.04) and diastolic (p = 0.04) blood pressure, but not after adjustment for changes in proteinuria. Blood pressure control and the total number of cardiovascular events were similar in the two treatment groups; In chronic kidney disease with proteinuria of 3 g or more per 24 h, ramipril safely reduces proteinuria and the rate of decline in GFR to an extent that appears to exceed the reduction expected for the extent of blood pressure decline.",1,0

This study examined the effect of fosinopril, 10 mg orally daily, on HIV-associated nephropathy (HIV-AN). Twenty patients with NA-HIV were studied. Of 11 patients with non-nephrotic range proteinuria, 7 received treatment and 4 did not. The mean baseline creatinine (mg/dL) for treated and untreated patients was 1.3 +/- 0.24 and 1.0 +/- 0.25, respectively (P = 0.07).

Comparing baseline measurements with measurements taken after 4 weeks, DBP was significantly reduced by 6.8 +/- 7.4 (mean +/- SD) mm Hg and 12.0 +/- 7.1 mm Hg in the doxazosin and enalapril groups, respectively. Systolic blood pressure decreased significantly from baseline to the end of treatment in both groups. There were no significant changes in heart rate from baseline to the end of treatment in the doxazosin group, but there was a statistically significant decrease in heart rate in the enalapril group. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was statistically significantly increased in the doxazosin group but not in the enalapril group. A decrease in triglycerides was statistically significant for the doxazosin group and was close to significance for the enalapril group. Forty-nine (62%) patients in the doxazosin group and 43 (54%) patients in the enalapril group reported at least one adverse event. Significant reductions in DBP were achieved after 4 weeks of treatment with both medications, each taken once daily. This reduction was more pronounced in the enalapril group 24 hours post-dose, with a mean final daily dose of 2.8 mg doxazosin and 12.6 mg enalapril.

These effects may be mediated, at least in part, by suppression of lethal ventricular tachycardia (VT). The objectives of this study were to examine whether the ACE inhibitor cilazapril reduces ventricular arrhythmia in patients with congestive heart failure and, if cilazapril reduces ventricular arrhythmia, to determine whether this reduction is associated with suppression of sympathetic nerve activity in these patients. . Thirty-two patients with congestive heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction, 35 +/- 6%; New York Heart Association class II or III) with VT (Low grade IVa or IVb) were randomly assigned to receive a conventional therapy, consisting of diuretics and digitalis (control group), or conventional therapy plus cilazapril (cilazapril group). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was performed at baseline and after 2 months of treatment. Plasma norepinephrine levels and heart rate variability (standard deviation about the mean RR interval) were compared at baseline and after 2 months of treatment. The control group showed no significant changes in the frequency of arrhythmias after 2 months of treatment. In the cilazapril group, however, the number of ventricular pairs and VT series decreased significantly. In association with this reduction, plasma norepinephrine levels decreased and heart rate variability increased. These results suggest that cilazapril has antiarrhythmic effects, which may be produced by suppressing high sympathetic activity, in patients with congestive heart failure. It should be noted that the study group was small, and although ventricular dysrhythmia was reduced by therapy, it was still significant. More studies are needed to verify these results and determine the exact causes of the reduction.",0,0

We recently reported strong sodium retention and renal vasoconstriction during pathophysiological increases in plasma ET-1. Apart from this vasoconstrictive action, ET-1 also has mitogenic properties that play a role in the pathophysiology of hypertension. On the other hand, some data refute an important role of ET-1 in hypertension. Therefore, we investigated the constrictor actions of ET-1 in nine subjects with essential hypertension by challenging these subjects with a systemic infusion of ET-1 (0.5 ng/kg per minute for 60 minutes, then 1.0 ng/kg per minute). per minute for 60 minutes, and finally 2.0 ng/kg per minute for 60 minutes). In addition, we studied whether these effects of ET-1 could be modulated by oral use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg BID) or the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (60 mg OD). ET-1 infusion increased plasma ET-1 levels from 2.5+/-0.4 to 11.6+/-1.0 pmol/L (p<0.05). Blood pressure increased by approximately 10 mm Hg (p < 0.05). Cardiac index decreased by 21+/-22%, while calculated systemic vascular resistance increased by 27+/-6% (p < 0.05). Renal blood flow decreased from 1051+/-94 to 707+/-60 mL/min at the end of ET-1 infusion (p < 0.05), and calculated renal vascular resistance increased from 118+/-19 at 189+/-19 mm Hg x min/l (p < 0.05). Sodium excretion decreased from 227+/-39 to 111+/-15 micromol/min (p < 0.05). Both enalapril and nifedipine treatment prevented the systemic effects of ET-1 infusion in these subjects. However, during enalapril treatment, despite renal predilation, ET-1 reduced renal blood flow (from 1119+/-132 to 701+/-75 ml/min, p<0.05) and increased renal blood flow. renal vascular resistance (111+/-16 to 187+/-28 mm Hg x min/L, P < 0.05) at the same levels as during ET-1 infusion alone. Nifedipine pretreatment attenuated the ET-1-induced drop in renal blood flow (from 1088+/-93 to 907+/-68 ml/min) and the increase in renal vascular resistance (from 105+/-9 to 133 +/-10mmHg x min/L). Although neither drug modulated the antinatriuretic effect of ET-1, nifedipine increased basal sodium excretion (p < 0.05), which compensated for the decrease during ET-1 infusion. In conclusion, essential hypertensive patients are sensitive to the vasoconstrictor effects of ET-1. Both enalapril and nifedipine can prevent the systemic effects of ET-1, but nifedipine appears to be more effective in attenuating the renal constricting effects of ET-1.",0,0

Therefore, we compared the efficacy and safety of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide in a 12-week multicenter, double-blind trial in 232 obese patients with hypertension. Patients with office diastolic pressure between 90 and 109 mm Hg were randomized to receive treatment with daily doses of lisinopril (10, 20, or 40 mg), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5, 25, or 50 mg), or placebo. Mean body mass indices were similar for all patients. At week 12, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide effectively reduced office diastolic (-8.3 and -7.7 vs. -3.3 mm Hg, respectively; p < 0.005) and systolic (-9.2 and - 10.0 vs -4.6 mm Hg, respectively, p < 0.05) ) pressures compared to placebo. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring confirmed that lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide effectively lowered blood pressure at 24 hours compared to placebo (p < 0.001). Significant dose-response differences were observed between treatments. Sixty percent of lisinopril-treated patients had office diastolic pressure <90 mm Hg compared with 43% of hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients (p < 0.05). Responses to therapies differed with both race and age. Neither treatment significantly affected insulin or lipid profiles; however, plasma glucose was significantly increased after 12 weeks of treatment with hydrochlorothiazide compared with lisinopril (+0.31 vs -0.21 mmol/l; p < 0.001). Hydrochlorothiazide also decreased serum potassium levels by 0.4 mmol/L from baseline. In conclusion, lisinopril was as effective as hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of obese patients with hypertension. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may show greater efficacy as monotherapy at lower doses compared to thiazide diuretics, may have a faster response rate, and may offer advantages in patients at high risk of metabolic disorders.",0,0

Furthermore, treated hypertensive patients still have a higher rate of cardiovascular complications, compared to matched normotensives. This is particularly evident in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), an important independent risk indicator for cardiovascular disease. In addition to raising blood pressure, angiotensin II (A-II) exerts an important influence on cardiac structure and function, stimulating cell proliferation and growth. Therefore, to further reduce morbidity and mortality in the treatment of hypertensive patients, it may be important to effectively block the effects of A-II. This can be achieved directly at the A-II receptor level with losartan, the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents. Therefore, it seems pertinent to investigate whether selective A-II receptor blockade with losartan not only reduces blood pressure but also reduces LVH more effectively than current therapy and thus improves prognosis. The Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) study is a double-blind, prospective, parallel-group study designed to compare the effects of losartan with those of the beta-blocker atenolol in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in approximately 8300 hypertensives. patients (baseline sitting diastolic blood pressure 95 to 115 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure 160 to 200 mm Hg) with electrocardiographically documented LVH.

Chinese patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In addition to the hypotensive effects of the combinations of both drugs versus monotherapy, all administered once a day, the effect on quality of life was also evaluated. This study consisted of a 3 x 2 multifactorial design in which 156 women and men with a sitting diastolic pressure between 95 mm Hg and 114 mm Hg, after a 4-week placebo washout phase, were randomized to one of six treatment groups for 12 weeks of active treatment. Monotherapy with diltiazem 120 or 240 mg produced incremental reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Compared to placebo, lisinopril 10 mg had an intermediate effect between diltiazem doses. The combinations of diltiazem 240 mg + lisinopril 10 mg and diltiazem 120 mg + lisinopril 10 mg showed greater efficacy in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to the doses of these drugs used in monotherapy, but the effect of the combinations was less than predicted by a model additive. Although the total number of other reported adverse events was similar for all active treatment groups compared to placebo, lisinopril-induced cough was common with an incidence of 31% after rechallenge. Premature discontinuation of the drug was necessary in four of the 78 patients who received lisinopril, due to an intractable cough. The combination of diltiazem 240 mg and lisinopril 10 mg was significantly more effective in lowering blood pressure than either drug alone; this additive effect did not result in a higher rate of adverse events or impaired quality of life. Therefore, combination therapy with these agents was well tolerated and resulted in greater efficacy in these elderly patients.",0,0

However, it is not known whether this is due to suppression of angiotensin (Ang) II production or reduced degradation of bradykinin; In eight normotensive patients with angiographic evidence of mild left coronary artery lesions (< or = 50%), mean arterial pressure (MAP, intra-arterial catheter), heart rate (HR, ECG lead), coronary sinus blood flow (CSF , thermodilution method), and coronary vascular resistance (CVR, ratio of MAP to CBF) were measured before and during a 15-minute left intracoronary infusion of Ang II at a dose that had no direct coronary or systemic vasomotor effects. The same measurements were made before and during a 15 minute saline infusion. A 2-minute cold pressure test (CPT) and a 45-second dive were performed at the end of each infusion period. These maneuvers were used because their coronary vasomotor effects are abolished by phentolamine and thus depend on sympathetic activation. During saline infusion, both CPT and diving caused a marked increase in MAP. HR increased with CPT and decreased with diving. CBF increased in parallel with the increase in MAP, with little change in CVR. MAP and HR responses were similar during Ang II infusion, which, however, caused no change or a reduction in CBF with a consequent marked increase in CVR with both CPT and diving. In four additional patients, the diameter of the stenotic vessels remained unchanged during CPT performed with saline infusion and Ang II; Ang II markedly increases sympathetic influences on the coronary circulation in humans, presumably acting at the arteriolar level. This may explain the attenuating effect of ACE inhibition on sympathetic coronary vasoconstriction in patients with coronary artery disease.",0,0

The present study was conducted to assess the sites and extent of in vivo ACE inhibition by long-term treatment with perindopril in different layers of the internal mammary artery in patients with ischemic heart disease; Sixteen patients with ischemic heart disease were treated with perindopril (4 mg/day orally) up to 36 days before surgery (n = 9) or without the inhibitor as control subjects (n = 7). Internal mammary artery segments were harvested for measurement of total and vascular free ACE by 125I-351A binding in vitro quantitative autoradiography. Patients treated with perindopril had a lower plasma ACE (P < 0.001) and a lower plasma angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang I ratio (P < 0.05). In the internal mammary artery, free ACE was similarly inhibited by perindopril in the endothelium (P < 0.05) and adventitia (P < 0.05), and the ratio of free ACE to total ACE, an index of ACE inhibition was markedly decreased by perindopril in parallel in the endothelium (p < 0.001) and adventitia (p < 0.001). In addition, plasma ACE was highly correlated with vascular ACE in the endothelium (r = 0.85, p < 0.001) or adventitia (r = 0.78, p < 0.001), and mean arterial pressure was significantly correlated with ACE.

Light microscopic autoradiographs of 125I-351A binding revealed marked inhibition of ACE by perindopril in both layers of the vessel wall; The present demonstrates that long-term administration of perindopril potently inhibits both endothelial and adventitial ACE to a comparable degree in the human internal mammary artery. These results indicate that perindopril effectively penetrates the vascular wall to inhibit ACE in the adventitia, providing evidence that perindopril may be beneficial in inhibiting both circulating Ang II and its local formation in the vascular wall.",0,0

Left ventricular hypertrophy and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism are possible contributors to the high risk of cardiovascular death in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis. We investigated the effects of simvastatin on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and the effects of enalapril on left ventricular mass in 107 patients receiving hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Patients were randomized in a factorial design to receive simvastatin (10 mg daily) or placebo and enalapril (2.5-5 mg daily) or placebo. During follow-up, there was a significant excess of patients who withdrew enalapril due to hypotension (2p = 0.002), and at 6 months only 55% of those assigned to enalapril were still on treatment. From baseline to 6 months, there were no statistically significant differences in left ventricular mass or left ventricular dimensions between patients assigned to enalapril and those assigned to placebo. Among patients assigned simvastatin, total cholesterol was reduced by 13% (2p = 0.001), LDL cholesterol was reduced by 17% (2p = 0.003), and apolipoprotein B was reduced by 12% (2p = 0.005) compared to patients assigned placebo. There were borderline significant (2p = 0.05 to 0.08) reductions in VLDL cholesterol, total triglycerides, and VLDL triglycerides of 26%, 12%, and 17%, respectively.

Meta-analysis suggests a 12% reduction in all-cause mortality, a 20% reduction in coronary heart disease, and a 36% reduction in stroke. The absolute benefits of treatment are large due to the high incidence of vascular disease among the elderly. However, clinicians may have been deterred from starting treatment due to concerns about adverse effects on cognition, mood, functional ability, and quality of life. Recent evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that these concerns are unfounded.

The addition of the latter reduced blood pressure in patients who did not respond sufficiently to valsartan monotherapy. Preliminary data also suggest that valsartan may be effective in patients with severe essential hypertension. The drug was as effective as lisinopril in treating mild to moderate essential hypertension in patients with kidney failure and did not worsen kidney function. Headache, dizziness, and fatigue were the most common adverse events in placebo-controlled studies; the incidence of these adverse events was not significantly different between those receiving placebo and valsartan.

However, it is not known whether mild MI is an independent predictor of post-MI outcome; The study cohort consisted of 727 patients from the Ventricular Enlargement and Survival Study who underwent cardiac catheterization, including left ventriculography, up to 16 days after myocardial infarction. Left ventriculograms were analyzed to determine diastolic and systolic volumes, global left ventricular sphericity, degree of wall motion abnormality, and endocardial curvature. The presence of MI was related to the risk of developing a cardiovascular event during 3.5 years of follow-up. MRI was present in 141 patients (19.4%). Severe MR (3+) was present in only 2 patients. Patients with MRI were more likely to have a persistently occluded infarct artery (MRI vs. no MRI, 27.3% vs. 15.2%; P = .001). Although ejection fractions were similar, MR patients had larger end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes and more spherical ventricles than non-MR patients. The change in sphericity from diastole to systole was also significantly reduced in MR patients. MI patients were more likely to have cardiovascular mortality (29% vs. 12%; p < 0.001), severe heart failure (24% vs. 16%; p = 0.0153), and the composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality , severe heart failure, failure, or recurrent myocardial infarction (47% vs. 29%; p < 0.001).

MBF was quantified at rest, during pacing tachycardia and after dipyridamole by positron emission tomography and 13N-ammonia before and 6 months after treatment after 1 week of pharmacological washout. In both groups, blood pressure and heart rate during flow measurements were not different before and after therapy. Before treatment, mean MSF at rest, during stimulatory tachycardia, and after dipyridamole infusion was similar in the two groups; however, stimulation and dipyridamole fluxes were significantly lower than those obtained in a control group of normotensive subjects. After treatment, in patients treated with enalapril, MBF did not change in the three study conditions. In patients treated with verapamil, MBF did not change at rest and increased significantly during stimulation and after dipyridamole. The inhomogeneity of the regional distribution of MBF, assessed from the coefficient of variation, decreased at rest after both treatments and, in the enalapril group, also during stimulation. No relationship was found between changes in FSM and changes in left ventricular mass; In arterial hypertension, the MBF during pacemaker tachycardia and after dipyridamole is altered. Successful verapamil therapy increases the MBF response to these stimuli, independent of changes in perfusion pressure and left ventricular mass. These results suggest that verapamil directly improves coronary microcirculatory function in hypertension.

Within the treatment trial, the placebo group showed both a higher peak PNE and an increase in PNE with exercise than the enalapril group, whose HR response was maintained despite a decrease in PNE with exercise. We conclude that (1) compared to asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction manifest increased adrenergic activity at rest and exercise, with a blunted HR response; and (2) in symptomatic patients, 1 year of enalapril treatment produced an increased HR response to adrenergic stimulation, supporting an interaction between renin/angiotensin and adrenergic nervous systems.

Low-dose captopril (12.5 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase in SD delta RR (16.0 +/- 6.6 to 22.0 +/- 9.1 ms; p < 0.05 ). We previously validated this as a measure of PSNA. The highest dose of captopril (25 mg twice daily) also produced an increase in PSNA activity (16.0 +/- 6.6 to 18.7 +/- 7.8 ms), although this did not reach statistical significance. However, the highest dose of captopril (50 mg twice daily) reduced PSNA activity to values close to baseline, as shown by HRV measurements in the time and frequency domains.

2207,9282581,Effect of enalapril on renal profile and right ventricular dimensions in chronic cor pulmonale.,,"Mahajan, S K; Sharma, V K; Thakral, S","The effect of enalapril in combination with bronchodilators, diuretics, antibiotics and/or steroids was compared with that of conventional treatment with diuretics, steroids and antibiotics alone in 30 patients with chronic cor-pulmonale. The effect on right ventricular dimensions and renal profile was studied after a 6-week treatment period. Control patients showed a significant decrease in RVIDED and an increase in GFR, but the decrease in RVAWT and the increase in 'a' wave amplitude were negligible. However, when the ACE inhibitor enalapril was added to treatment, there was a significant decrease in RVIDED, RVAWT, and an increase in 'a' wave amplitude with a significant improvement in GFR. A comparison between both groups showed that the increase in GFR and the decrease in RVIDED were greater in the enalapril group than in the controls. The increase in the amplitude of the 'a' wave was also greater in the enalapril group. Therefore, enalapril appears to be of value in chronic cor-pulmonale, where it decreases pulmonary hypertension and thus after right ventricular loading. It also decreases renal vascular resistance by increasing renal blood flow, thus improving GFR.",0,0

2210,9284842,Calcium channel blockers: an evidence-based review.,,"Waters, D","Calcium channel blockers are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, but their proper therapeutic role is controversial. However, drugs in this class have been evaluated in many controlled clinical trials of adequate size and duration in different patient populations. Although many important questions remain unanswered, these trials have clarified when and how these drugs should be used. In general, the benefits of calcium channel blockers in controlling angina and hypertension are much more clearly documented than their long-term effects on more difficult endpoints, such as mortality. These long-term data are much needed, particularly for hypertension. An increased risk has been clearly seen with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in several studies of patients with coronary heart disease. In coronary heart failure patients, the harmful effects of nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil outweigh any possible benefit. Long-acting formulations and newer calcium channel blockers may not share all of the adverse effects of older drugs in this class; however, its long-term safety has not yet been documented. Understanding the limitations of calcium channel blockers, based on evidence from clinical trials, often leads the practitioner to choose a drug from another class, where efficacy has been clearly demonstrated.",0,0

In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, we found that spironolactone treatment reduced circulating levels of the N-terminal aminopeptide of type III procollagen, a marker of vascular collagen turnover, and also increased time-domain parameters of heart rate variability. cardiac (n = 24). These latter parameters suggest a parasympathomimetic effect for additional spironolactone. Spironolactone significantly reduced heart rate (prolonged RR interval), especially during the dawn hours (06:00-09:00 h). In this unbalanced study it was not possible to provide a detailed diurnal assessment of the impact of spironolactone on heart rate variability, but preliminary data suggest that there may be a time-varying interaction with the autonomic nervous system.; These are the first human data to show that use of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone can positively improve time-domain heart rate variability and reduce myocardial collagen turnover, as reflected by further reductions in serum procollagen peptide, despite concomitant treatment with ACE inhibitors. Thus, residual aldosterone after ACE inhibitor treatment may play a role in promoting arrhythmia and cardiac death by two mechanisms.

Taking into account the area under the curve of BP values during the 6-hour treatment, the overall hypotensive effect of nifedipine capsules was similar to captopril in Caucasian patients, but significantly more pronounced than captopril and delayed nifedipine. in black patients. Similar maximal BP drops (mean+/-wk) were obtained in white patients with nifedipine capsules (71+/-4/52+/-4 mm Hg) and with captopril (69+/-4/50+/ -3mmHg). In black patients, the maximum BP drop for nifedipine capsules (70+/-4/52+/-4 mm Hg) was greater (P < 0.02) than that for captopril (48+/- 4/32+/-3 mm Hg) but similar to that of delayed nifedipine (71+/-4/49+/-4 mm Hg). However, in contrast to nifedipine capsules and captopril, nifedipine retardation produced a slower fall in BP. The moment of maximum fall in BP for nifedipine and captopril capsules occurred within the first 2 h, while for delayed nifedipine it occurred only between 4 and 6 h after administration. Fewer patients reported side effects with delayed nifedipine compared with the other two preparations. We conclude that single doses of captopril and nifedipine reduce BP for at least 6 hours in white and black patients with hypertensive crisis, but nifedipine is more potent than captopril in black patients. The slow-release form of nifedipine-delay lowers BP effectively and safely while achieving a fast enough effect without the critical rapid drops in BP that occur with nifedipine capsules.",0,0

At the beginning of the study and later at the end of the third, sixth and twelfth months, each patient underwent an integrated echocardiographic study and non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Both drugs significantly reduced casual or monitored blood pressure (p < 0.01) and left ventricular mass index (from 125 +/- 32 to 100 +/- 12 gm/m2 [p < 0.02] with amlodipine and from 106 +/- 18 to 89 +/- 10 g/m2 [p < 0.02] with fosinopril). The decrease in left ventricular mass was essentially due to a reduction in ventricular thickness. Right ventricular free wall thickness was also reduced in both groups, most consistently with amlodipine (from 8.0 +/- 2.1 to 6.4 +/- 0.8 mm; p < 0.01 ), without an increase in plasma natriuretic peptide and insulin concentrations or heart rate. With both treatments, the decrease in ventricular mass was not associated with deterioration in systolic function, while a trend toward improvement in echocardiographic Doppler indices of biventricular diastolic function was observed. In conclusion, both amlodipine and fosinopril induced similar qualitative effects on the anatomy and function of both ventricles.

In half of our patients, increases in the insulin/glucose ratio (IGR) suggestive of insulin resistance were found. Hyperinsulinemic and normoinsulinemic obese patients with hypertension had comparable fasting glucose and DHEA-S concentrations and comparable blood pressure (BP) levels. Therefore, no relationship was found between fasting insulin and DHEA-S levels. Fasting hyperinsulinemia was found in only half of obese subjects with hypertension, suggesting that not all obese patients with hypertension have the same high cardiovascular risk. Short-term treatment with captopril, prazosin, verapamil, atenolol, or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) lowered BP; a greater reduction in BP was observed with drugs with vasodilator effects.

The first drugs reduced fasting insulin levels that were within normal limits or in the hyperinsulinemic range. None of the pharmacological treatments produced significant increases in serum DHEA-S concentrations, although some of them considerably reduced fasting insulin levels. No relationships were observed between insulin levels and DHEA-S either at the beginning or at the end of antihypertensive treatment.

DBP normalization rates (<90 mmHg) were 64.1% (R/C) and 28.6% (enalapril) (2p < 0.01). Adverse events considered possibly or definitely drug-related by the investigator were observed in 11 patients (17.2%) in the R/C group and 9 patients (14.3%) in the enalapril (NS) group. Two patients in the enalapril group discontinued the study prematurely due to adverse events (cough, rash). In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, a combination of reserpine and low-dose clopamide once daily is considerably more effective than, and as tolerable as, enalapril 5-10 mg once daily. These findings suggest that treatment with a combination of different antihypertensive agents with different modes of action at low doses is a rational alternative to conventional monotherapy in the first-line treatment of hypertension. In addition, the ""old"" reserpine-diuretic regimen also these days seems to be a rational alternative to ""modern"" monotherapies.",0,0
2244,9360002,Lack of effect of short-term administration of lisinopril on left ventricular filling dynamics in hypertensive patients with diastolic dysfunction.,,"Cuspidi, C; Lonati, L; Sampieri, L; Leonetti, G; Muiesan, M L; Agabiti-Rosei, E; Zanchetti, A","Arterial hypertension may be associated with an alteration in the filling dynamics of the left ventricle. The specific objective of this study was to assess whether short-term administration of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in hypertensive patients with altered diastolic pattern induced an improvement in left ventricular dynamics, assessed by echocardiography-Doppler technique, independently of the effects on the left ventricular mass. . In a double-blind crossover study, 39 essential hypertensive patients with an early to peak atrial velocity ratio (E/A) < 1 were randomised, after a 2-week run-in period without any antihypertensive treatment, to receive lisinopril. (20 mg once daily) and placebo for 4 weeks, respectively. At the end of the run-in and treatment periods, blood pressure and heart rate were measured and an echocardio-Doppler examination was performed. Echocardio-Doppler evaluation was performed both at rest and at the peak of a hand grip test (3 min at 30% of maximal force). Left ventricular dimensions were obtained from two-dimensionally guided M-mode tracings using the criteria of the American Society of Echocardiography. Left ventricular peak filling rates and filling rate integrals were measured by pulsed Doppler technique. Lisinopril caused a significant reduction in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure (-13/-9 mmHg vs. baseline, p < 0.05; -6/-4 mmHg vs. placebo, p < 0, 05) and during isometric exercise (-17/-9 mmHg vs. baseline, p < 0.05; -6/-5 mmHg vs. placebo, p < 0.05). Lisinopril did not induce any significant changes in left ventricular structure or systolic function. All considered left ventricular filling parameters (E velocity, A velocity, E/A ratio) both at rest and during isometric exercise did not differ significantly after treatment with lisinopril compared to those obtained under baseline conditions and after administration of lisinopril. placebo. This double-blind crossover study demonstrates that short-term afterload reduction induced by lisinopril does not modify altered diastolic dynamics in hypertensive patients. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is a complex process influenced by a number of functional and structural factors and apparently cannot be significantly ameliorated by short-term blood pressure reduction with antihypertensive treatment.",0,0

The objective of this study was to find out whether or not there were differences in the pharmacokinetic profile and hemodynamic response of a single oral dose of 100 mg of captopril between subjects of both sexes. Twenty-four young healthy volunteers (12 men and 12 women) participated in the trial. Blood samples were obtained to evaluate plasma concentrations of captopril, determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as well as hemodynamic variables, before and at different times after drug intake.

2250,9370181,Prolonged therapy with ACE inhibitors induces a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in dialyzed uremic patients regardless of hypotensive effects.,,"Cannella, G; Paoletti, E; Delfino, R; Peloso, G; Rolla, D; Molinari, S","Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which frequently occurs in chronic uremia, may be due in part to factors other than arterial hypertension, chronic anemia, and/or other well-known loading conditions inherent to the uremic state. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can reverse LVH by mechanisms independent of their antihypertensive effects. In this study, 18 subjects free of arterial hypertension or severe anemia were selected from 170 chronically hemodialyzed uremic patients after meeting the criteria of a supranormal left ventricular mass (LVM). Ten subjects agreed to treatment with lisinopril 2.5 to 20 mg every other day for a period of 2 years, during which yearly measurements of LVM by echocardiography and 24-hour blood pressure were made with a portable device. Eight patients who did not wish to undergo treatment served as controls. The overall group's mean resting left ventricular mass index (LVMi) was 178 +/- 30 g/m2 body surface area (+/- SD) and did not differ between the two subgroups. Lisinopril treatment significantly decreased LVM in eight of the 10 treated subjects and, in fact, even completely normalized it in three. The LVM of the untreated group was unchanged. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 138 +/- 5 mm Hg and 78 +/- 6 mm Hg in the treated group and 133 +/- 9 mm Hg and 75 +/- 4 mm Hg in the untreated group, respectively ( P = NS), and did not change in the following 2 years. This study indicates that a mild degree of LVH, apparently independent of blood pressure burden, exists in a small subgroup of uremic patients. This study also shows that this type of LVH is apparently not progressive. ACE inhibitors given at doses that do not affect blood pressure can reverse it.",0,0

2254,9377617,Coadministration of tamsulosin and three antihypertensive agents in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia: pharmacodynamic effect.,,"Lowe, F C","Tamsulosin, an alpha 1A adrenergic receptor antagonist, was recently approved to treat patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Tamsulosin is highly selective for prostate receptors with minimal affinity for vascular receptors. Therefore, it should have little effect on blood pressure and should not potentiate the antihypertensive activity of other agents. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to assess how tamsulosin co-administration would affect the pharmacodynamic profiles of nifedipine, enalapril, and atenolol. Each study enrolled 12 hypertensive men aged 45 years or older whose blood pressure was being controlled with maintenance doses of nifedipine (Study 1), enalapril (Study 2), or atenolol (Study 3). The 36 subjects were treated with placebo for 5 days and then randomized to either placebo (control group) or tamsulosin therapy (0.4 mg/day for 7 days followed by 0.8 mg/day for 7 days) plus to continue your maintenance antihypertensive therapy. . Blood pressure and pulse were monitored over a 24-hour period on study days 4, 11, and 19. Tamsulosin co-administration in these small studies had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacodynamic action of nifedipine, enalapril, or atenolol; it did not produce clinically significant differences in pulse rate and blood pressure, did not alter the results of EKG or Holter monitoring, and did not cause an increase in side effects. Tamsulosin co-administration with the three antihypertensive agents studied had a favorable safety profile. Our results in these small studies indicate that the dose of nifedipine, enalapril, or atenolol did not require adjustment in patients receiving tamsulosin, which may give tamsulosin an advantage over other alpha-blocking agents used to treat patients with BPH. Now that tamsulosin has been approved in the United States, further clinical use may confirm these findings.",0,0

The study design was double-blind for the first 6 months and open-label thereafter. Captopril 25-50 mg/day was added to the treatment of patients who did not respond; subsequently, patients who did not respond to combination therapy were switched to any therapy chosen by the treating physicians (free therapy). The subject's seated blood pressure, heart rate, and a standard clinical safety profile (electrocardiogram, laboratory tests, adverse events, cardiovascular events, and deaths) were regularly assessed throughout the study.; After 2 years, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced in members of both treatment groups (16.3/16.6% with verapamil and 16.9/16.2% with chlorthalidone, both by analysis of variance , P < 0.0001). The patients to whom we added captopril treatment constituted 22.6% of the verapamil group and 26.2% of the chlorthalidone group; while 11.6 and 12.2% of the patients in these groups, respectively, received free therapy.

Adverse events were reported in 32.5% of patients treated with verapamil and 33.4% of those treated with chlorthalidone. The most common adverse events were constipation in members of the verapamil group (13.7%) and asthenia in members of the chlorthalidone group (8.5%). In total, 315 dropped out (153 from the verapamil group and 162 from the chlorthalidone group).

2256,9384458,Pharmacological treatment in acute porphyria.,,"Gorchein, A","Acute hepatic porphyrias are rare pharmacogenetic diseases that are inherited as autosomal dominant conditions with low penetrance. The genetic defect is a 50% deficiency of an enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway. Patients can develop ""neurovisceral seizures"" that include severe abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric manifestations, and life-threatening respiratory paralysis. Attacks generally occur after puberty, are much more common in females, and can be precipitated by endogenous hormonal changes, diet, alcohol, serious infections, and many drugs. Treatment includes analgesia, early administration of heme, and general supportive measures. Patients are at increased risk of a severe attack on first presentation, as an abdominal emergency can be simulated and inappropriate medication, including general anesthesia, can exacerbate the attack. The urine should be tested for elevated porphobilinogen, which is pathognomonic of the acute attack, if there is even the slightest doubt about the diagnosis. Blood relatives of index cases should be genotyped so that carriers can avoid drugs and other precipitants. Some drugs have been established as safe or unsafe for clinical use, but information on many drugs is not available or is based solely on their properties in rodents or tissue culture systems. The relevance of these to the human condition remains controversial, but drugs that have been shown to be porphyrinogenic in animal systems should be avoided if a known safe alternative exists. When it is essential to use a drug that is not known to be safe, careful biochemical and clinical observation may warn of an impending attack.",0,0

We evaluated carotid vascular resistance by Doppler analysis and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by the 133Xe clearance technique before and after a single 5-mg oral dose of isradipine, enalapril, or placebo. Its effects were tested randomly and consecutively in 73 patients with essential hypertension subdivided into three groups: without carotid occlusive lesions, with moderate stenosis (50-75%) and with severe asymptomatic unilateral ICA stenosis (76-99%). There were no differences in age, gender, and antihypertensive effects of drugs among these three subgroups. Three main variants of cerebrovascular drug effects were observed: no change (variant I), decreased carotid vascular resistance with increased rCBF and elimination of side-to-side asymmetry (variant II), and increased vascular resistance. carotid artery with greater reduction in rCBF ipsilaterally ICA stenosis and increased side-to-side asymmetry (variant III). The frequency of variant III was significantly higher in patients with severe stenosis of the ICA. Enalapril produced variant I cerebrovascular effects in the majority of patients examined; variant III was seen in only 13% of patients with severe ICA stenosis. Isradipine produced variant I cerebrovascular events much less frequently than enalapril. For this drug, variant II was more typical in patients without ICA stenosis and with moderate ICA stenosis. However, in 43.5% of patients with severe ICA stenosis, isradipine produced a reduction in cerebral perfusion. Presumably, the presence of ICA stenosis, especially >75%, increases the risk of cerebrovascular events on antihypertensive therapy. In patients with severe ICA stenosis, treatment with enalapril appears to be safer than isradipine.",0,0

Blood pressure decline was similar for patients in all four studies, mean systolic BP decline was between 18 and 20 mm Hg, mean diastolic BP decline was between 11 and 13 mm Hg. Fewer patients in the open-label unstructured trial reported adverse events than patients in the RCT; a 55% relative reduction in reported adverse events (p < 0.008) was associated with the unstructured trial. Fewer drug-related adverse events per patient were also reported in the unstructured study (17 per 100 patients) than in the other studies (27 to 41 per 100 patients), P < 0.008. Physician preference for rounding blood pressure measurements to 0 or 5 occurred more frequently in the open-label unstructured trial (p < 0.008). In conclusion, despite differences in dose titration and use of adjuvant therapy, the efficacy of antihypertensive drug therapy observed in an RCT may be similar to that of uncontrolled postmarketing studies. Open-label trials with scheduled follow-up visits are as effective in detecting serious adverse events as RCTs, but post-marketing studies with unstructured follow-up programs are insufficient to identify drug-related adverse events and have poorer quality data.",0,0

In addition, we determined the interaction effects of these therapies on neurohormonal activation and of patients' environmental sodium intake on outcomes; Sustained-release nifedipine (nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system, GITS) 30-120 mg/day was compared in a double-blind sequential randomized placebo-controlled trial with enalapril 5-30 mg/day for blood pressure control in the office and 24-hour plasma renin activity, norepinephrine and epinephrine levels, and 24-hour urine protein and sodium in 46 elderly non-diabetic hypertensive patients in a 16- to 18-week trial; Both nifedipine GITS and enalapril controlled ambulatory blood pressure during the day and to maximum effect. Nifedipine GITS controlled ambulatory blood pressure during the morning peak and also overnight. Nifedipine GITS increased plasma renin and norepinephrine activity by 50% and 20%, respectively, compared to the 150% and 0% change produced by enalapril. Both nifedipine GITS and enalapril reduced proteinuria by 37%. Patients had increasing levels of proteinuria proportional to higher environmental sodium intake (r = 0.48, p < 0.01). This effect was accentuated during GITS nifedipine therapy compared to enalapril; Nifedipine GITS was superior to enalapril in controlling ambulatory blood pressure, but they were equivalent in reducing proteinuria (37%). They had disparate effects on neuronal activation and duration of action. Increased protein excretion appears to be associated with increased sodium intake. This was especially evident during nifedipine XL therapy.",0,0

2273,9408513,Oral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Verme-Gibboney, C","The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical uses, adverse effects, drug interactions, dosage, cost, and therapeutic interchangeability of oral angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are reviewed. ACE inhibitors attenuate the formation of angiotension II and can lead to accumulation of kinins. Although the hypotensive effects of many ACE inhibitors can persist for 24 hours, some patients require more than one dose per day to achieve adequate control. These agents accumulate in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, but it is unclear whether dosage adjustment is necessary. ACE inhibitors are effective against mild to moderate hypertension; for severe hypertension, additional antihypertensive agents may be necessary. Other conditions in which ACE inhibitors have shown efficacy include congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, chronic renal failure, insulin sensitivity, and coronary artery disease. The most common adverse effect is a persistent non-productive cough. Angioedema, fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, acute renal failure, and hyperkalemia may also occur. ACE inhibitors can interact with diuretics, lithium, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral hypoglycemic agents, and some other medications. ACE inhibitor therapy should be started at low doses which can then be slowly titrated upwards. Many of the agents have similar costs for lower and higher doses. The only significant differences between ACE inhibitors are the time to onset of hypotensive effects, time to peak effect, and duration of effect. Each formulary must include at least captopril and one intermediate-acting and one long-acting ACE inhibitor.",0,0

There is a need to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new treatments for MI in this high-risk population. We evaluated whether treatment with an ACE inhibitor initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset is capable of reducing mortality and morbidity in diabetic patients with acute MI; A retrospective analysis of data from the GISSI-3 study was performed in patients with and without a history of diabetes. Patients with suspected acute MI were randomized to receive treatment with lisinopril (2.5 to 5 up to 10 mg/d) with or without nitroglycerin (5 to 20 microg IV then 10 mg/d) started within 24 hours and continued for 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was mortality at 6 weeks, and the secondary endpoint was a combined assessment of mortality and severe left ventricular dysfunction. Information on diabetic status was available for 18,131 patients (approximately 94% of the total enrolled population), of whom 2790 patients had a history of diabetes. Lisinopril treatment was associated with decreased 6-week mortality in diabetic patients (8.7% vs. 12.4%; OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.86; 37+/-12 lives saved per 1000 patients treated), an effect that was significantly (p < 0.025) greater than that seen in non-diabetic patients. The survival benefit in diabetics was mainly maintained at 6 months despite treatment discontinuation at 6 weeks (12.9% vs. 16.1%; OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0. 62 to 0.95); Early treatment with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in diabetic patients with acute MI is associated with decreased mortality at 6 weeks. This beneficial effect supports the widespread and early use of ACE inhibitors in diabetic patients with acute MI. The burden of mortality plus morbidity from ventricular dysfunction in diabetics remains clinically important and warrants further testing of new therapeutic approaches.",1,1

Increased pulse pressure was associated with increasing age, left ventricular ejection fraction, female sex, history of prior myocardial infarction, diabetes, and hypertension, and the use of digoxin and calcium channel blockers. During a 42-month period, there were 503 deaths, 422 cardiovascular deaths, and 303 myocardial infarctions.

2276,9416938,Comparison of changes in respiratory function and oxygen consumption during exercise with losartan versus enalapril in congestive heart failure secondary to ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.,,"Guazzi, M; Melzi, G; Agostoni, P","In congestive heart failure (CHF), some of the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as an increase in oxygen consumption during exercise (VO2), are mediated by prostaglandins. Angiotensin receptor blockers (AT1) apparently do not share the potentiation of this biosystem. We tested whether losartan improves exercise VO2 in CHF and whether the effect is the same as for enalapril. Sixteen men with CHF and 8 volunteers, all nonsmokers and not taking ACE, AT1 receptor, or cyclooxygenase inhibitors, were randomized to receive placebo, enalapril (10 mg twice daily), losartan (50 mg/day ), each of these 2 medications plus aspirin (325 mg/day), aspirin, or the same preparations in reverse order, each for 3 weeks, with a 3-week washout period between treatments. Lung function and VO2 were evaluated at the end of each treatment. In CHF, losartan and enalapril caused a similar improvement in VO2 and exercise tolerance, which was absent in controls and counteracted by aspirin (prostaglandin inhibition) when obtained with enalapril and not with losartan. While taking enalapril, we also detected an increase in lung carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, which correlated with changes in VO2 and was antagonized by aspirin, suggesting the possibility that a prostaglandin-mediated functional enhancement of alveolar capillary membrane contributes to the increase in VO2. Therefore, losartan is as effective as enalapril for VO2 exercise and exercise tolerance, but the mechanism appears to be dissociated from activation of the prostaglandin biosystem. Losartan may represent an advance in CHF because its efficacy on VO2 is similar to that of enalapril, but it is not antagonized by aspirin.",0,0

A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use in the management of hypertension.,,"Gillis, J C; Markham, A","Irbesartan inhibits angiotensin II (AII) activity through specific, selective, and non-competitive antagonism of the AII receptor subtype 1 (AT1), which mediates most of the known physiological activities of AII. In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once daily administration of 150 or 300 mg irbesartan, with or without adjunctive antihypertensive agents, provides effective 24-hour BP control. Irbesartan lowered BP to a similar extent as enalapril and atenolol and to a significantly greater extent than losartan. The combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide resulted in additive antihypertensive effects. The drug is effective in the elderly and dose adjustment is not necessary in these patients or in those with renal or hepatic insufficiency. Preliminary studies evaluating the efficacy of irbesartan in patients with heart failure have shown encouraging results. Irbesartan is very well tolerated and neither the frequency nor the pattern of adverse events differs from that observed in those who received placebo, although headache was significantly more frequent in the latter. Similarly, the incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between irbesartan and enalapril in patients receiving either drug as monotherapy. Headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and musculoskeletal pain were the most common complaints. Therefore, irbesartan is an effective therapy for patients with mild to moderate hypertension and had an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo in clinical trials. Based on this, it would seem to be an effective therapeutic option in this indication.",0,0

To assess the potential role of the renin-angiotensin system in mediating this phenomenon, we treated patients concomitantly with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor; The anti-ischemic efficacy of organic nitrates is rapidly weakened by the development of nitrate tolerance. The underlying mechanisms are most likely multifactorial and may involve increased vasoconstrictor responsiveness; Forearm blood flow and vascular resistance were determined using strain gauge plethysmography. Short-term responses to intra-arterial angiotensin II (1, 3, 9, and 27 ng/min) and phenylephrine (an alpha-adrenergic agonist drug, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1 microg/min) were studied. min) in 40 male patients with stable disease. coronary artery disease. These patients were randomized into four groups that received 48 h of treatment with NTG (0.5 microg/kg body weight per minute) or placebo with or without the ACE inhibitor captopril (25 mg three times a day); In patients treated with NTG alone, the maximum reductions in forearm blood flow in response to angiotensin II and phenylephrine were markedly greater (-64 +/- 3% and -53 +/- 4%, respectively) than those of patients receiving placebo (-41 +/- 2% and -42 +/- 2%, respectively). Captopril treatment completely prevented NTG-induced hypersensitivity to angiotensin II and phenylephrine (-33 +/- 3% and -35 +/- 3%, respectively), but had no significant effect on flow responses. in patients without treatment with NTG (-34 +/- 3% and -35 +/- 3%, respectively). +/- 2% and -37 +/- 3%, respectively).; We conclude that continuous administration of NTG is associated with increased sensitivity to phenylephrine and angiotensin II that is prevented by concomitant treatment with captopril.

Half of the patients treated with perindopril showed a decrease in urinary protein excretion from 6.1 +/- 1.0 to 1.2 +/- 0.5 g/24 h and an increase in serum albumin levels.

In 3 patients in whom perindopril treatment was continued for 18-24 months, urinary protein excretion remained below 1 g/24 h. The data show that perindopril: (1) is an effective agent in the treatment of proteinuria in primary renal diseases; (2) the effect is maintained for up to 2 years if the drugs are continued, and (3) this action of perindopril does not depend on the level of sodium intake.",0,0

The effect of various angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on HRV in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has not been studied; Ninety patients with uncomplicated AMI (age range 39-75 years, median 61 years) were randomly assigned to six groups of 15 patients each. They were treated with placebo or one of the following ACE inhibitors for 30 days: captopril, cilazapril, enalapril, lisinopril, or quinapril. HRV was assessed 3 days after AMI onset (baseline) and 30 days after treatment. Fifteen patients with stable coronary artery disease and 15 healthy volunteers, matched for age and sex with patients with AMI, served as controls.; At baseline, the time- and frequency-domain HRV indices in the AMI groups were similarly lower than those in patients with stable coronary artery disease and normal volunteers. Compared with placebo, quinapril, lisinopril and captopril changed HRV indices in the frequency domain 30 days after the start of treatment, indicating an increase in vagal tone, while enalapril and cilazapril had no significant effect on these indices.

Tight glycemic control may only partially slow the development and progression of retinopathy. Blood pressure is also a risk factor for microvascular complications. Antihypertensive therapy, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, may slow the progression of nephropathy, but effects on retinopathy have not been established. We investigated the effect of lisinopril on retinopathy in type 1 diabetes; As part of a 2-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we took retinal photographs at baseline and during follow-up (24 months) in patients aged 20 to 59 years in 15 European centers. The patients were not hypertensive and were normoalbuminuric (85%) or microalbuminuric. Retinopathy was graded from photographs on a five-level scale (none to proliferative); The proportion of patients with retinopathy at baseline was 65% (117) in the placebo group and 59% (103) in the lisinopril group (p = 0.2). Patients treated with lisinopril had significantly lower HbA1c at baseline than those treated with placebo (6.9% vs. 7.3 p=0.05). Retinopathy progressed at least one level in 21 (13.2%) of 159 lisinopril patients and 39 (23.4%) of 166 placebo patients (odds ratio 0.50 [95% CI 0.28-0.89 ], p = 0.02). This 50% reduction was the same when adjusted for center and glycemic control (0.55 [0.30-1.03], p = 0.06). Lisinopril also decreased progression by two or more grades (0.27 [0.07-1.00], p = 0.05) and progression to proliferative retinopathy (0.18 [0.04-0.82], p = 0.03). Progression was not associated with albuminuric status at baseline. Treatment reduced the incidence of retinopathy (0.69 [0.30-1.59], p = 0.4); Lisinopril may slow the progression of retinopathy in non-hypertensive patients who have type 1 diabetes with little or no renal disease.

This is a potentially dangerous trend because it undermines what should be the main objective of drug development, that is, to make available to the patient active medicinal agents with accurate and reliable information, at the lowest possible cost, particularly when a national health system has to supply the drugs to patients who have incomes too low to pay for them. The huge drug market has also set in motion competition among pharmaceutical companies. This has meant that as soon as a prototype drug becomes available, other similar active compounds will follow immediately. These followers are often called ""me too drugs."" Me-too drugs can be broadly defined as chemically related to the prototype or other chemical compounds that have an identical mechanism of action. This growing marketing of drugs has been called into question and so pharmaceutical companies are justifying the development of less innovative drugs. The most common arguments can be summarized as follows: me-too drugs offer an improvement in the efficacy of the prototype; they show a different profile of adverse effects; they are effective in patients resistant to the prototype; improve adherence to long-term treatment; they are less expensive than the prototype. The purpose of this article is to review the evidence supporting these claims, providing some figures on me too drugs and presenting some examples.",0,0
2287,9443770,Effects of bisoprolol and captopril on insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in essential hypertension.,,"Dominguez, L J; Barbagallo, M; Jacober, S J; Jacobs, D B; Sowers, J R","Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers have been reported to have disparate effects on insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was to study the effects of the selective beta-1 blocker bisoprolol and the ACE inhibitor captopril on cellular insulin action in hypertensive individuals. After washout, 12 mild-to-moderate essential hypertensives were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive bisoprolol 5 mg daily or captopril 25 mg twice daily for 8 weeks. Erythrocyte insulin binding and insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase (TK) activity were measured before and after therapy. Both agents significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure (bisoprolol 96.5+/-0.9 to 87.8+/-3.1 mm Hg; captopril 96.5+/-0.9 to 91.5+/-1 .8 mm Hg, P < 0.05). Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin/glucose indices were unchanged after both therapies, as were lipid profiles. Peak insulin-stimulated TK activity, as assessed by phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate poly-Glu80Tyr20, was significantly (P < 0.05) higher after bisoprolol treatment, but not after captopril treatment, compared with placebo ( bisoprolol 8.5+/-1.8, captopril 7.3+/-1.5, placebo: 6.4+/-1.3 pmol 32P-ATP/fmol bound insulin). However, captopril, but not bisoprolol, increased the sensitivity of TK receptor activity, as measured by the mean maximum activity concentration (ED50). The specific binding of insulin was not affected by these two agents. Therefore, both captopril and bisoprolol may have favorable but different effects on TK activity and insulin action at the cellular level.",0,0

We used Cox regression to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics and to assess the interaction between PAC use and selected patient variables in relation to outcome; APA use (46.3% of patients) was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0 .73 to 0.92, p = 0.0005) and a reduced risk of death or hospital admission for HF (adjusted HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.89, p < 0.0001) , but was not influenced by trial allocation, gender, LV ejection fraction, New York Heart Association class, or aetiology. A strong interaction was observed between PAC use, randomization group, and all-cause mortality. The association between APA use and survival was not seen in the enalapril group, nor was a survival benefit of enalapril detected in patients receiving APA at baseline. However, randomization to treatment with enalapril significantly reduced the combined endpoint of death or hospital admission for HF in PAC users.; In patients with LV systolic dysfunction, the use of APA is associated with better survival and lower morbidity. This association is maintained after adjustment of the initial characteristics. APA use is associated with the retained but reduced benefit of enalapril.",0,0

Patients have been randomized to receive conventional antihypertensive therapy (diuretics and/or beta-blockers) or captopril-based treatment. A prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded evaluation (PROBE) study design is used to compare these two therapeutic regimens with respect to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The rationale for the CAPPP study is the numerous observations of beneficial effects of ACE inhibition, compared to diuretics and beta-blockers, on intermediate endpoints such as insulin sensitivity, serum lipoproteins, left ventricular hypertrophy, and kidney function. Captopril has also been shown to be remarkably effective in the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction, as well as congestive heart failure. The hypothesis is that these differences could result in better risk reduction when ACE inhibitors are used in the treatment of hypertension. The present work describes the baseline data and the changes in blood pressure during the first year in the total cohort. During the first year, the average blood pressure dropped by 11/8 mm Hg. Several substudies have been conducted in the CAPPP study. In one of these, insulin sensitivity was compared in a subgroup of patients using the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. In another substudy, the ACE gene was sequenced and some new polymorphisms were discovered. Several other substudies are in progress or in the planning phase. The main results of the CAPPP Study should be available by mid-1998. Some of the anticipated analyzes of the final results, as well as other planned substudies, are briefly described here.",0,0

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition appears to have a specific renoprotective role in diabetic nephropathy, possibly by reducing intraglomerular pressure. The acute effects of ACE inhibition on renal hemodynamics in normotensive non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) have not been previously reported. We simultaneously measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) in 29 subjects (4 women), with a mean age of 52 years (range 27-70), using 51Cr EDTA and 125I Hippuran. The clearances have been corrected to 1.73 m(-2). All patients were normotensive (blood pressure < 75th percentile for age and sex), newly diagnosed (< 30 days), without antihypertensive or hypoglycemic medication. Subjects were randomly assigned (double-blind) to receive the ACE inhibitor trandolapril 4 mg day(-1)(H) (hypotensive dose), trandolapril 0.5 mg day(-1)(L) (non-hypotensive dose). or placebo (P) for 10 days, after which renal hemodynamics were remeasured. For all subjects, baseline GFR, RPF, and filtration fraction (FF) were 97+/-21 mL min(-1) mean+/-SD, 439+/-120 mL min(-1), and 22, 3+/-2.9% respectively. Glomerular hyperfiltration (GFR > 120 ml min[-1]) was only demonstrated in 3 subjects (10.3%). In group H, mean arterial pressure (103+/-8 vs. 93+/-9 mmHg, p < 0.001) and FF (23.8+/-2.3 vs. 20.0+/-4, 0%, p = 0.03) decreased while RPF increased (376 +/-111 vs. 426 +/-60 mL min(-1), p = 0.02), there was no significant change in GFR. There were no significant changes in mean arterial pressure, GFR, RPF, or FF in groups P and L.

The study design was parallel, two-period, placebo-controlled, crossover, double-blind, with 11 subjects receiving perindopril and 10 receiving amlodipine during the initial phase. The addition of amlodipine to perindopril had no effect on ambulatory BP, whereas the addition of perindopril to amlodipine reduced both systolic (P = 0.027) and diastolic (P = 0.049) ambulatory BP. In contrast, the opposite result was obtained for clinical BP in the trough, where the addition of amlodipine to perindopril reduced standing systolic BP (P = 0.036) and both supine and standing diastolic BP (P = 0.038). ), while the addition of perindopril to amlodipine was lower. without effect. The addition of perindopril to amlodipine decreased serum ACE by 72% and increased PRA two-fold, with no change in plasma levels of Ang II, aldosterone, or alpha-h ANP. The addition of amlodipine to perindopril increased plasma aldosterone by 1.7-fold, but did not affect serum ACE, PRA, Ang II or alpha-h ANP. These interactions between perindopril and amlodipine may have been conditioned by the specific effects of the initially administered therapy, as well as by the different circumstances of BP measurement (ambulatory vs clinical).",0,0

In the open-label phase, 562 patients received the fixed combination, titrated as needed to control SiDBP < 90 mm Hg. Efficacy was determined by minimal (24 +/- 2 h post-dose) measurements of sitting blood pressure at week 12 and at the end of the open-label portion of the study. Safety was assessed based on patient symptoms, clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms (ECGs). E5/D120 and E5/D180 significantly reduced trough SiDBP (-7.6 and -8.3 mm Hg, respectively; P < 0.05) compared to their monotherapies.

After a 2-week placebo run-in period, hypertensive patients were treated with trandolapril 2 mg once daily or perindopril 4 mg once daily for 4 weeks in a double-blind design. A placebo was then administered for 1 week. Three 1-week self-measured home blood pressure (SMBP) periods were scheduled: end of placebo run-in period, end of treatment period, and final placebo withdrawal period. Every day three consecutive measurements were requested both in the afternoon and in the morning. Individual reversion to baseline BP level was studied in the subgroup of patients who responded to therapy (decrease in evening diastolic BPSM > or = 6 mm Hg). The ratio (R) of mean post-drug DBP decrease (residual effect) over overnight DBP decrease with drug (full effect) was used to study reversion to baseline. Patients who presented a value lower than the median of this relationship were called Reverters, while others were called Nonreverters. One hundred nineteen patients entered the analysis. During the treatment period, mean MAP decreased significantly, from 150 +/- 14/97 +/- 7 mm Hg to 139 +/- 15/91 +/- 9 mm Hg (all P < 0.001). The level of BP with the drug was similar at night in the two treatment groups. However, morning systolic and diastolic AMPA levels were significantly lower in the trandolapril group. After drug discontinuation, mean BP level increased significantly to 144 +/- 14/94 +/- 9 mm Hg (all P = 0.01), but remained below baseline BP values (P = 0.003 for SBP and P = 0.001). 002 for PAD).

In this subgroup, the median R-ratio used to analyze reversion to baseline after drug discontinuation was 44%. Non-reversers were characterized by sustained BP lowering with the drug, compared with reversers. Thus, we conclude that withdrawal of ACE inhibitor therapy is accompanied by a rapid rise in BP (within 48 h), followed by a 5-day BP plateau that is lower than baseline. Reversions to baseline after drug discontinuation were more likely to be insufficiently controlled during treatment, especially in the morning. The longer duration of action of trandolapril was associated with lower morning BP during the active treatment phase and the 1-week post-treatment phase.",0,0

Incidence, prevention and management.",,"Vleeming, W; van Amsterdam, J G; Stricker, B H; de Wildt, D J","Information available from 1980 to 1997 on angioedema induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and its underlying mechanisms is summarized and discussed. The incidence of angioedema is low (0.1 to 0.2%), but it can be considered a life-threatening side effect of ACE inhibitor therapy. This side effect of ACE inhibitors, regardless of chemical structure, can occur early in treatment as well as after prolonged exposure over several years. The estimated incidence is quite underestimated. The true incidence may be much higher due to the underrecognized presentation of angioedema as a consequence of its late onset in combination with generally long-term therapy. Furthermore, a spontaneous reporting bias may contribute to a higher actual incidence of this phenomenon. The incidence may be even higher (up to 3-fold) in certain risk groups, for example, African-Americans. Treatment includes immediate discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor and acute symptomatic supportive therapy followed by immediate (and long-term) alternative therapy with other classes of medications to control hypertension and/or heart failure. Preclinical and clinical studies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of angioedema associated with ACE inhibitors have not generated definitive conclusions. Immunological processes and various mediator systems (bradykinin, histamine, substance P, and prostaglandins) are suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of angioedema. Most of all reports reviewed suggest a relationship between ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema and increased (tissue) bradykinin levels. However, no conclusive evidence of a role for bradykinin in angioedema has been found and it seems unlikely that bradykinin has an exclusive role. So far, no clear evidence of an immune-mediated pathogenesis has been found. In addition, ACE gene polymorphism and some enzyme deficiencies are proposed to be involved in ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. Advances in molecular biology and pharmacogenetic research should shed more light on a possible genetic component in the pathogenesis of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema.",0,0

To investigate this question, we genotyped for common polymorphisms for these three genes in subjects with a history of ACE inhibitor-related cough. The specificity of the adverse effect was confirmed using a double-blind crossover design protocol in which subjects returned to receive lisinopril or placebo. In 99 case subjects and 70 control subjects (who did not develop cough on ACE inhibitor rechallenge) thus selected, the frequencies for ACE D and I alleles were 0.56 and 0.44 (cases) and 0.56 and 0.44 (controls), respectively; frequencies for chymase A and B alleles (absence/presence of BstXI site) were 0.56 and 0.44 (cases) and 0.46 and 0.54 (controls), respectively; the frequencies for the + and - alleles of the bradykinin B2 receptor (presence/absence of a sequence of 21 to 29 nonanucleotides) were 0.52 and 0.48 (cases) and 0.53 and 0.47 (controls), respectively .

Therefore, in the present study, we used the cumulative incidence of progression to albuminuria (albumin excretion rate [AER] > 200 micrograms/min) of MA as the primary endpoint and the annual increase in AER at a rate of 50%. % above baseline as the secondary endpoint of renal function.; Ninety-two normotensive IDDM patients underwent double-blind, double-dummy treatment with slow-release lisinopril or nifedipine compared with placebo. Ten patients dropped out of the study during the 3-year follow-up period; During the 3-year follow-up period, 7 of 34 placebo-treated patients (20.6%), 2 of 32 lisinopril-treated patients (6.3%), and 2 of 26 nifedipine-treated patients (7.7%) progressed to clinical albuminuria (Fisher syndrome). exact test, P < 0.03). Time-to-event analysis indicated a reduction in the risk of progression to macroalbuminuria of 58.1% (95% CI 27.8-68.4%) in the 32 patients treated with lisinopril (P < 0.02) and 62.5% (95% CI 32.5-73.4%) in the 26 nifedipine-treated patients (P < 0.02) after adjusting for mean arterial pressure, glycated hemoglobin, and baseline AER compared with the 34 patients treated with placebo. The initial AER was 71 micrograms/min (range: 20.7-187.3) in progressors and 73 micrograms/min (range: 20.2-174.1) in non-progressors (NS). The percentage of patients showing >50% annual increase in AER above baseline was significantly lower in the lisinopril group (13 of 32, 40.6%, P<0.02), but not in the lisinopril group. of nifedipine (15 of 26, 57.7%) than in the placebo group (23 of 34, 67.6%). The lisinopril group had significantly lower blood pressure values during follow-up than the nifedipine group (P < 0.05) or the placebo group (P < 0.01); Our data show that both lisinopril and nifedipine are effective in delaying the onset of macroalbuminuria in normotensive patients with IDDM and AM. Since overt proteinuria is a strong predictor of end-stage renal failure, both treatments appear to be able to prevent this complication in normotensive patients with IDDM and MA. However, lisinopril appears to be more effective in slowing the course of kidney disease.",0,0

After 6 weeks of treatment, the daily dose was doubled in patients whose sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) remained > or = 90 mm Hg; Patients with essential hypertension who had a minimum mean DBP of 95-115 mm Hg after the placebo run-in period were randomized to treatment with losartan (N = 192) or captopril (N = 204); The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline to week 12 in SiDBP trough. Safety was assessed by recording reported or spontaneously observed adverse experiences and clinical laboratory measurements.; After 12 weeks, both treatments produced clinically important reductions in SiDBP and sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP). These mean reductions (PADSi, PASSi) were significantly greater in the losartan group (-11.5 and -15.4 mm Hg, respectively) than in the captopril group (-9.3 and -12.2 mm Hg, respectively) (p = 0.010 for diastolic and p = 0.023 for systolic). The percentage of patients who showed an excellent (via SiDBP < 90 mm Hg) or good (via SiDBP > 90 mm Hg, with a decrease of > or = 10 mm Hg) antihypertensive response to treatment with losartan and captopril in week 12 was comparable (60.0% and 54.7%, respectively). The percentage of patients who reported an adverse clinical experience that the investigator considered to be drug-related was 13% in the captopril group and 10% in the losartan group. The incidence of drug-related cough was 2.6% in the losartan group and 4.4% in the captopril group; Losartan 50 to 100 mg once daily is an effective treatment for patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.

The following case illustrates the clinical dangers of polypharmacy and serves as a critical discussion point. MEDLINE was searched using the keyword ""polypharmacy"" from 1994 to the present. The report of a case of polypharmacy is described and a novel protocol for the management of polypharmacy is proposed; Polypharmacy can lead to unnecessary expense, wasted time and embarrassment on the part of the patient, and confusion and mismanagement on the part of the physician. The literature reveals controversy surrounding the definition of polypharmacy and reflects the considerable morbidity and expense associated with polypharmacy. Finally, the SAIL protocol shows that clinicians must consider simplicity, adverse effects, indications, and an accurate list of all medications to properly manage a patient's medication regimen; Polypharmacy is associated with morbidity and iatrogenic complications. The SAIL protocol can be a useful tool in managing this entity. More research is needed on the prevalence, complications, and treatment of polypharmacy.",0,0

Eighteen patients were cross-randomized, double-blind, to receive each of four different medications for 8 weeks. ABPM was performed at baseline and after an 8-week treatment with these drugs. A washout period of 2 to 3 weeks occurred both at baseline and between each of the four drugs. Three patients were omitted from the statistical analysis due to technical problems with the ABPM. Atenolol, isradipine ORS, and spirapril significantly (P < 0.01) lowered mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure, whereas HCTZ did not. Mean 24-h diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly after all four drugs: 12 (SD+/-14) mm Hg with atenolol, 7 (SD+/-10) mm Hg with isradipine ORS, 3 mm Hg (SD+/-14) with HCTZ, and 6 (SD+/-15) mm Hg with spirapril (P < 0.01). During the night, neither drug significantly reduced mean systolic or diastolic blood pressure. According to the 24-hour blood pressure curve, the influence of these four drugs throughout the measurement period was not similar. Atenolol and spirapril lost their antihypertensive effect during the early morning hours. The antihypertensive effect of HCTZ varied markedly from hour to hour. The trough-peak ratio for no drug was >0.50. A negative correlation was observed between apnea time and mean 24-h systolic (r = -0.604, P = NS) and change in mean overnight systolic blood pressure (r = -0.590, P = NS).

Sitting trough diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 4.5 mm Hg, 4.3 mm Hg, and 8.1 mm Hg more than placebo in the trandolapril, verapamil SR, and combination groups, respectively. In the combination group, sitting diastolic blood pressure was significantly (p < 0.01) lowered by 3.6 mm Hg more than the trandolapril group and 3.8 mm Hg more than the verapamil SR group. . An analysis of the trough-peak relationship for sitting diastolic blood pressure revealed values of 0.75 and 0.67, for the trandolapril 4 mg and combination groups, respectively, at end point. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was similar for all treatment groups. In this study, the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker was well tolerated and more effective than either agent given alone for the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension.",0,0

Plasma BNP levels increased and reached a peak of 192 +/- 28 pg/ML 16 hours after administration; thereafter, levels decreased and then increased again, forming the second peak of 217 +/- 38 pg/ML on the fifth day (biphasic pattern). On the other hand, plasma BNP levels increased and reached a maximum level of 190 +/- 22 pg/ml at 16 hours after admission and then decreased from 2 days after admission to the second week in the imidapril group ( monophasic pattern). Left ventricular ejection fraction measured at week 2 was significantly higher in the imidapril group than in the control group (62.2 +/- 1.1% vs. 51.2 +/- 3.6%, P <0.01); It is concluded that plasma BNP levels followed a monophasic pattern after treatment with imidapril, while a biphasic pattern followed after placebo, and that plasma BNP levels are a marker of ventricular dysfunction in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.",0,0

Clinical studies have documented increased blood pressure lowering when these agents are combined compared to individual agents, in short-term studies. In the present investigation, 93 patients with stage 3-4 essential hypertension, who successfully completed a short-term double-blind study, participated in a 40-week open-label treatment phase. Patients were maintained on their previous doses of enalapril/diltiazem ER (E/D) with or without additional antihypertensive medications. Medication doses may be adjusted as needed for blood pressure control. Of the 93 patients, 68% were male and 82% were white; they had a mean age of 52.7 years and an initial sitting mean blood pressure (SBP) of 167/111 mmHg. Use of E/D alone (n = 14) reduced mean SiBP by 14.5/14.4 mmHg from baseline, whereas use of E/D with other agents (n = 79) reduced mean SiBP by 27/ 20.5 mmHg from the start.

The design was a double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover, placebo-controlled study, that is, each patient served as their own control. The intracellular content of sodium and potassium in the erythrocytes was measured by flame photometry. The increase in intracellular sodium concentration during 1 h at 37 degrees C incubation of whole blood with ouabain (compared to no ouabain) was measured to determine the rate of active sodium efflux. The 24-hour blood pressure was recorded with a Space-lab unit (SL 90202) before and at the end of the salt load. Left ventricular morphology was evaluated with echocardiography and minimal vascular resistance of the vascular bed of the hand with water plethysmography at baseline and after 4 years with enalapril. Treatment with enalapril for four years caused a significant decrease in blood pressure, left ventricular mass, and minimal vascular resistance. During the 4 days of salt loading, the mean 24-h blood pressure was significantly elevated, 129+/-3/85+/-2 mmHg compared to 124+/-2/82+/-2 mmHg during treatment. with placebo (p= 0.025). The change (delta) in MAP during high salt intake showed a negative relationship with the delta sodium efflux rate constant (r = -0.65, p = 0.047). No significant relationship was found between blood pressure response to salt loading and structural cardiovascular changes. In conclusion, a short-term oral salt load in hypertensive patients on chronic treatment with enalapril caused an increase in blood pressure, which was related to cellular sodium transport but not to structural cardiovascular changes.",0,0

The hypercontractile state of the heart could be relieved by an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor through depression of CA release from the sympathetic nerve ending. Therefore, the ACE inhibitor could have a positive effect in the prevention of NMS. In this study, 24 elderly subjects who had reproducible NMS induced with the head-up tilt test (HUT) were randomized and double-blinded into placebo and ACE inhibitor groups. Plasma CA concentration [norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E)] was measured during HUT, and the effects of enalapril on SNM were observed in the two groups. Before enalapril administration, plasma CA concentrations were significantly increased during HUT compared with those in the supine position; In contrast, administration of enalapril (10 mg/day) for > 1 year inhibited the increase in plasma CA concentration and prevented syncope in all 12 patients (p < 0.05); however, placebo had no effect on plasma CA concentrations, and syncope resolved in only two of 12 patients after placebo administration. From this study, we conclude that enalapril can prevent NMS in patients, presumably due to its role in inhibiting CA release from sympathetic nerve endings.",0,0

No large multicenter AMI trial has provided information on LV thrombosis so far. The GISSI-3 study protocol included screening for the presence of LV thrombosis in patients from 200 coronary care units that did not specifically focus on LV thrombosis. We examined the results of the GISSI-3 database related to 8,326 patients with low to medium risk of LV thrombi in whom an echocardiogram was available prior to discharge (9 +/- 5 days). LV thrombosis was found in 427 patients (5.1%): 292 of 2544 patients (11.5%) with previous AMI and 135 of 5782 patients (2.3%) with AMI in other locations (p < 0.0001 ).

In patients with previous AMI, the administration or not of oral beta-blockers after early administration of intravenous beta-blockers does not influence the appearance of LV thrombosis. The rate of LV thrombosis was similar in patients treated or not with nitrates and lisinopril both in the total population and in patients with prior and non-previous AMI. In conclusion, in the GISSI-3 population at low to medium risk of LV thrombosis, the highest rate of LV thrombosis occurrence was found among patients with anterior AMI and ejection fraction <40%.

In both cases, the choice of treatment depends on its efficacy and side effects. With regard to acute drug therapy, group studies do not suggest that ergot derivatives and sumatriptan are superior to simple analgesics and anti-inflammatories, particularly if a prokinetic agent is added. These new substances are indicated for severe attacks refractory to more conventional therapy. Chronic drug abuse can induce drug-induced or rebound headaches. Regarding long-term prophylaxis, group studies suggest that calcium channel blockers and drugs that influence 5-HT are more frequent in attacks than beta-blockers, but have very frequent side effects (weight gain and drowsiness). ). Interesting preliminary results have also been reported with valproate and enalapril, which will be confirmed by controlled studies.

Treatment and administration assignments were double-blind. Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure was monitored before and after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. Renal hemodynamics were determined on the first day of drug administration and 12 and 24 hours after the last dose during chronic treatment; Administration of each antihypertensive agent induced renal vasodilation without significant changes in glomerular filtration rate. However, the time course seemed to differ: irbesartan had no significant acute effect 4 hours after the first dose, but during chronic administration a renal vasodilator response was found 12 and 24 hours after the dose; Enalapril was effective acutely and 12 hours after administration, but no residual effect was found 24 hours after dosing. Both antihypertensive agents reduced mean ambulatory blood pressure effectively, with no significant differences between treatments or between times of administration (morning versus evening); Irbesartan and enalapril have comparable effects on blood pressure and renal hemodynamics in hypertensive patients with normal renal function.

Whether antihypertensive therapy can normalize the hypertrophy of the conducting artery wall remains to be determined; Seventy-seven elderly hypertensive patients were randomized to receive 9 months of double-blind treatment with perindopril (2 to 8 mg/day) or the diuretic combination of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 50 mg/day) plus amiloride (1.25 to 5 mg/day). ) after a 1-month placebo washout period. If systolic blood pressure remained >160 mm Hg after 5 months, chlorthalidone or atenolol was added, respectively. Arterial variables, including radial artery mass and common carotid artery compliance, were calculated from noninvasive measurements of internal diameter and wall thickness using high-resolution echo tracking systems at beginning and after 5 and 9 months.; During treatment, blood pressure and arterial variables changed to the same extent in both groups. After a 9-month treatment, systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures and radial artery wall thickness, mass, and thickness/radius ratio decreased significantly (p < 0.01), while carotid artery compliance increased (p < 0.001). Decreased radial artery thickness-to-radius ratio after 9-month treatment was significantly associated with reduced pulse pressure (p < 0.01), while improved carotid compliance was associated with reduction in mean arterial pressure (p < 0.01). In healthy subjects and untreated hypertensive patients, radial artery diameter, wall thickness and thickness/radius ratio, and carotid artery compliance did not change significantly over a 9-month observation period; These results indicate that in elderly hypertensive patients, treatments based on a combination of ACE inhibitors and diuretics can reduce radial artery wall hypertrophy and improve carotid artery compliance.",0,0

The objective of this study is to evaluate atrial and ventricular function and exercise capacity in patients with mild heart failure treated with d,l-sotalol after electrical conversion of atrial fibrillation. The study included patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (for more than 2 weeks but less than 1 year) and mild heart failure (< or = NYHA class II). All patients had comparable baseline echocardiographic findings and received captopril. After successful cardioversion, patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 treated with sotalol (mean dose 240 mg once daily, max. 320 mg) and group 2 without sotalol. The abandonment criterion was lack of maintenance of sinus rhythm. Finally, 17 patients (10 men, 7 women, 41 to 60 years old) remained in the study; group 1 included 10 patients and group 2-7 patients. They were evaluated by quantitative + Doppler echocardiography and by standard ECG stress test at less than 1 month but more than 2 weeks, and at 1, 3, and 6 months. When first assessed (2 weeks to 1 month), maximum A-wave velocity and atrial filling index were higher in group 2 than in group 1 (37 +/- 10 cm/s vs 20 + /- 5 cm/s and 23% +/- 7 vs 13% +/- 5, respectively) and group 1 also had lower exercise tolerance (80 +/- 25 W vs 110 +/- 10 W). There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 in left atrial and left ventricular dimensions, ejection fraction, and E-wave deceleration time. After 1 month there were no significant differences in Doppler characteristics, echocardiographic parameters and exercise tolerance between the two groups. Group 1 remained with a lower heart rate and had a lower double peak product (17,250 mmHg/min vs 22,100 mmHg/min) corresponding to lower cardiac work. At 3 and 6 months there were no significant changes in any characteristics between the two groups. In conclusion, sotalol appears to be a well-tolerated antiarrhythmic agent in patients with mild heart failure after conversion from persistent atrial fibrillation. In this setting: 1. Sotalol might reversibly amplify the effect of atrial stunning after electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, but this effect is short-lived. 2. Sotalol does not have a relevant negative inotropic effect, at least not in association with captopril. 3. Sotalol improves exertion capacity.",0,0

We also describe the impact of ACE inhibitor prescriptions, ACE inhibitor dose increases, and nonpharmacologic educational interventions on readmission-free survival rates; We hypothesize that care by a cardiologist and higher mean blood pressure on admission are associated with receiving optimal doses of ACE inhibitors. We hypothesize that receiving an ACE inhibitor at discharge and an increase in ACE inhibitor dose during hospitalization are associated with superior readmission-free survival.; Between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 1993, the charts of consecutive hospitalized patients with a primary diagnosis of heart failure at an academic medical center were reviewed. Documented instructions and medications prescribed at discharge were summarized. Deaths and readmissions up to December 31, 1994 were identified with the National Death Index and the administrative database of the study institution, respectively; During 1992 and 1993, 387 patients were discharged alive from hospitalization for heart failure. Among patients discharged with enalapril or captopril, 18% received the doses recommended by the heart failure clinical practice guidelines. Patients discharged on a recommended dose of ACE inhibitor were more likely to be African American and had lower sodium levels and higher mean arterial pressures than patients discharged on lower doses of ACE inhibitor. In survival analyses, an increase in ACE inhibitor dose was associated with better readmission-free survival, regardless of the type of left ventricular systolic function. Receiving an ACE inhibitor at discharge was also associated with superior readmission-free survival, whereas non-pharmacological educational instructions were not associated with better outcomes.; Interventions are needed to improve the frequency with which ACE inhibitors are prescribed at recommended doses to hospitalized patients with heart failure. We conclude that among these patients, receiving an ACE inhibitor at discharge and an increase in the dose of the ACE inhibitor during hospitalization are associated with measurable effects on readmission-free survival, while the provision of instructions education as currently practiced is not associated with better outcomes.",0,0

The following parameters were determined: left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume index (LVEDVI, LVESVI), ejection fraction (LVEF), infarct weight, and muscle mass (MMLV). Volume-to-mass ratio (VMR) was calculated and clinical status was documented according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) guidelines at each examination time. Results were compared with those of an identically screened historical ACE inhibitor-naïve sample (n = 31, 10 women, 21 men, 36-75 years); LVEDVI and LVESVI increased in the first 6 months after infarction by 24.9% and 36.6%, respectively, in the historical sample; in 11.0 and 7.8%, respectively, under captopril; and 13.1 and 10.7%, respectively, with fosinopril. LVEF decreased by 14.9% in the untreated sample, 3.7% with captopril, and 5.0% with fosinopril. Infarct weight and LMVI increased by 12.7 and 15.3%, respectively, without ACE inhibition, by 5.7 and 10.1%, respectively, in patients treated with captopril, and by 6, 1 and 9.3%, respectively, in patients treated with fosinopril. The MRV increased by 7.4% in the historical sample, 3.5% in the captopril group, and 1.8% in the fosinopril group. NYHA clinical status improved by 18.2% without ACE inhibition, 42.9% in the captopril group and 26.3% in the fosinopril group. The differences between the two ACE inhibitor groups and the control group were all significant, while the differences between the captopril group and the fosinopril group were significant only for VMR (p < 0.01) and NYHA class ( p < 0.05); Both captopril and fosinopril have a comparable positive influence on post-infarction remodeling and clinical status. Lipophilicity and tissue affinity do not appear to play a clinically important role in ACE inhibitor therapy after infarction.",1,0

Of 107 consecutive living-related donor kidney transplants, proforma entry and full data available for 74 patients between June 1991 and March 1993 were analyzed. On the basis of antihypertensive or non-prescribed medications, patients were grouped in 6 categories. Group I patients who were not taking antihypertensive drugs were taken as controls. All patients were comparable in terms of age, sex, weight, immunosuppressive therapy, anesthetic and fluid management during surgery. At the time of anesthesia induction, patients taking atenolol (plasma K+ levels of 5.34 +/- 0.75 mmol/l in group II and 5.44 +/- 0.63 mmol/l in group III) or captopril (serum K+ levels of 5.05 +/- 0.94 mmol/l in group V) in combination with nifedipine and with or without clonidine had significant hyperkalaemia than the patient without antihypertensives (level serum K+ 4.49 +/- 0.71 mmol/l). Patients taking these two antihypertensives frequently required active treatment of alarming hyperkalaemia (blood K+ greater than 5 mmol/l and high 'T' wave in lead II) and cardiac arrhythmias. In conclusion, ESRD patients taking atenolol or captopril need frequent monitoring of blood potassium levels and it would be advisable to avoid these drugs to control hypertension in ESRD patients, especially when scheduled for kidney transplantation.",0,0

NETWORK was created to compare the effect of dose on clinical outcome of ACE inhibition.; 1,532 patients with heart failure from primary care (n = 619) and hospital sources (n = 913) were randomized to receive enalapril 2.5 mg twice daily (n = 506). 5 mg twice daily (n = 510) or 10 mg twice daily (n = 516). The mean age was 70 years and 65% were men. Coronary artery disease was the cause of heart failure in 71%. Sixty-five percent were in NYHA class II and 35% in class III or IV. The mean end-diastolic diameter of the left ventricle was 59 (SD 11) mm. The incidence of the primary endpoint of death, HF-related hospitalization, or worsening HF was assessed after each patient was followed for 24 weeks; The number of patients who achieved the primary endpoint was 62 (12.3%) in the 2.5 mg twice daily group, 66 (12.9%) in the 5 mg twice daily group, and 76 (14.7%) in the 10 mg twice daily group. Deaths in each group were 21 (4.2%), 17 (3.3%) and 15 (2.9%), respectively. There were no significant differences in results between the three groups. The crude relative risk for the combined endpoint in the 10 mg twice daily group compared to the 2.5 mg twice daily group was 1.20 (95% CI 0.88 to 1, 64); NETWORK did not demonstrate a relationship between enalapril dose and clinical outcome in selected heart failure patients from both primary care and hospital practice.",1,0

The primary objective of the Fosinopril versus Amlodipine Randomized Cardiovascular Events Trial (FACET) was to compare the effects of fosinopril and amlodipine on serum lipids and diabetes control in NIDDM patients with hypertension. Prospectively defined cardiovascular events were assessed as secondary outcomes.; Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of NIDDM and hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg). Exclusion criteria included a history of coronary heart disease or stroke, serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl, albuminuria > 40 micrograms/min, and use of lipid-lowering drugs, aspirin, or antihypertensive agents other than beta-blockers or diuretics. A total of 380 hypertensive diabetics were randomly assigned to open-label fosinopril (20 mg/day) or amlodipine (10 mg/day) and followed up to 3.5 years.

A 4-week placebo run-in period preceded 12-week active treatment with perindopril (4-8 mg daily) or carvedilol (25-50 mg daily). Endothelial functions were assessed by evaluating the hemodynamic (mean arterial pressure, blood flow in the legs) and rheological (platelet aggregation, blood viscosity, and blood filterability) responses to an intravenous bolus of 3 g of L-arginine, the precursor natural nitric oxide; Both perindopril and carvedilol significantly reduced mean arterial pressure (P < 0.001) and increased leg blood flow (P < 0.05) to the same extent; blood filterability was unchanged in the groups treated with perindopril and carvedilol. Carvedilol significantly reduced platelet aggregation and blood viscosity (P < 0.05), but perindopril did not. Before treatment, hemodynamic and rheologic responses to L-arginine were significantly lower in patients (P < 0.05-0.01) than in 20 nondiabetic, nonhypertensive control subjects. After 12 weeks of treatment, both drugs normalized hemodynamic responses to L-arginine. Platelet aggregation response to L-arginine was improved with carvedilol and remained unchanged in the perindopril group.; At the doses used, both drugs effectively lower blood pressure and normalize hemodynamic responses to L-arginine.

Overall, GFR decreased linearly by 0.46 +/- 0.05 ml/min/1.73 m2/month (mean rate +/- SEM) during a median follow-up of 23 months (range 3 to 64 months). ), and progression to ESRF was 17.3% Using multivariate analysis, higher UProt and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were independently correlated with faster delta GFR (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively) and progression to ESRF (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.003, respectively). Mean UProt and systolic blood pressure during follow-up were the only time-dependent covariates that were significantly correlated with delta GFR (P = 0.005 and P = 0.003, respectively) and ESRF (P = 0.006 and P = 0.0001, respectively). ). After stratification for baseline UProt, patients in the lowest tertile (UProt < 1.9 g/24 h) had the slowest delta GFR (0.16 +/- 0.07 mL/min/1.73 m2 /month) and progression to ESRF (4.3%) compared to patients in the middle tertile (UProt 2.0 to 3.8 g/24 hr; delta GFR, 0.55 +/- 0.09 mL/min /1.73 m2/month, P = 0.0002; ESRF, 15.3%, P = 0.0001) and in the highest tertile (UProt 3.9 to 18.8 g/24 h; delta GFR, 0.70 +/- 0.11 mL/min/1.73 m2/month, P = 0.0001, ESRF, 32.5%, P = 0.0001). Both delta GFR (P = 0.01) and progression to ESRF (P = 0.01) differed significantly even between the middle and top tertiles. In contrast, tertile stratification of the initial MAP was unable to segregate patient subgroups at different risk levels. The patients with the highest proteinuria and blood pressure were the ones with the greatest progression (delta GFR, 0.91 +/- 0.23; ESRF 34.7%). Of interest, at each baseline MAP level, higher proteinuria was associated with faster delta GFR and progression to ESRF. On the other hand, at each level of proteinuria, a faster delta GFR was associated with MAP only in the highest tertile (>112 mm Hg), and ESRF risk was independent of MAP. Thus, in chronic kidney disease, proteinuria is the best independent predictor of both disease progression and ESRF. Arterial hypertension may contribute to the acceleration of renal injury associated with increased plasma protein trafficking. The antihypertensive drugs that most effectively limit protein trafficking at comparable blood pressure levels are those that most effectively slow disease progression and delay or prevent ESRF in proteinuric CKD.",0,0

2360,9577953,Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Brown, N J; Vaughan, D E","ACE inhibitors have achieved widespread use in the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases. ACE inhibitors alter the balance between the vasoconstrictive, salt-retaining and hypertrophic properties of angiotensin II (Ang II) and the vasodilatory and natriuretic properties of bradykinin and alter the metabolism of other vasoactive substances. ACE inhibitors differ in the chemical structure of their active moieties, potency, bioavailability, plasma half-life, route of elimination, distribution and affinity for tissue-bound ACE, and if administered as prodrugs. Therefore, the side effects of ACE inhibitors can be divided into those that are class specific and those that are related to specific agents. ACE inhibitors decrease systemic vascular resistance without increasing heart rate and promote natriuresis. They have been shown to be effective in the treatment of hypertension, reduce mortality in congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, and delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

It is largely unknown whether pulse pressure amplification is modified by ACE inhibition and whether changes in compliance and compliance are due to a drug effect on the arterial wall, blood pressure reduction, or a combination of both factors. In a randomized double-blind crossover trial, we used the ACE inhibitor quinapril as a marker to assess changes in: pulse pressure amplification (applanation tonometry), carotid compliance and compliance (echo-tracking technique), and aortic compliance ( measured from pulse wave velocity). Quinapril decreased carotid and brachial pulse pressure to the same extent, thus causing a return of pulse pressure amplification towards normal values. Carotid compliance and compliance, as well as aortic compliance, were significantly increased. Based on three-way analysis of variance, it was shown that, while changes in carotid stiffness were due exclusively to blood pressure reduction and not drug-induced relaxation of the arterial wall, changes in carotid aortic compliance were due to the combination of both factors. Thus, using an atraumatic noninvasive procedure, it was possible to show that: (i) ACE inhibition is able to maintain pulse pressure amplification, an important factor that contributes to reducing the afterload of the heart; and (ii) ACE inhibition alters the hypertensive arterial wall in a very heterogeneous manner, with a maximal effect of the drug on large muscular arteries such as the abdominal aorta, and not on elastic arteries such as the carotid artery and thoracic aorta.",0,0

Investigational medications were administered 2 to 4 weeks after AMI onset, and subjects were followed for a median period of 19 months. All patients received aspirin 50 mg/day. Observation endpoints were cardiac events and noncardiac events. Cardiac events included sudden cardiac death (SCD), death from heart failure, total cardiac deaths, and myocardial reinfarction; The clinical conditions of the three groups were compatible. Sixty-six cardiac events (6.0%) occurred. Compared with group C, the rate of SCD significantly decreased by 68% in group A after atenolol treatment for 28 months. Both atenolol and enalapril significantly increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), while LVEF did not change in group C during the follow-up period.

Spironolactone treatment is reported to be useful when combined with loop diuretics and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in severe congestive heart failure (CHF). However, the effects of the addition of spironolactone on exercise capacity and neurohormonal variables have not been demonstrated. This study determined the effects of additive spironolactone on exercise capacity and neurohormonal factors in patients with mild CHF. 2. Oxygen consumption (VO2), plasma norepinephrine (NE), renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II (AII), aldosterone (ALD) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were measured at rest and after maximal exercise in nine patients with CHF (six idiopathic and three ischemic cardiomyopathies; New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II and III) who were already taking furosemide (mean 29 +/- 5 mg/day) and enalapril (mean 4.7 +/- 0.8 mg/day). The studies were repeated after 16 weeks of treatment with an additive single daily dose of 25 mg spironolactone. In four of nine patients, the exercise test was repeated after a 4-week washout with spironolactone. 3. Spironolactone treatment caused natriuresis, decreased cardiothoracic index on chest x-ray (before vs. after treatment: 53.7 +/- 1.2 vs. 50.7 +/- 1.4%, P < 0.01) and improvement in NYHA functional class. VO2 max (17.1 +/- 1.6 vs. 17.5 +/- 2.2 mL/min/kg, NS) and heart rate and blood pressure responses to exercise were not altered.

ALD and AII were negligibly increased, and ANP negligibly decreased at maximal exercise after spironolactone treatment. Spironolactone washout was associated with a tendency for neurohormones to return to pretreatment values. 4. In conclusion, chronic additive treatment with spironolactone was associated with neurohormonal activation both at rest and during exercise without changing exercise capacity in patients with mild CHF who were already treated with loop diuretics and ACE inhibitors .",0,0

In view of the strong association of LV hypertrophy with cardiovascular risk, this study was designed to compare the impact of diuretic therapy and ACE inhibition on cardiac and vascular structure. Fifty essential hypertensives (74% male, 88% nonwhite) participated in a 6-month double-blind study and were randomized to receive ramipril or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Echocardiography, carotid ultrasonography, and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring were performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after initiation of therapy. The 22 ramipril patients were comparable to the 28 HCTZ patients at baseline for age, race, and 24-hour BP. Although HCTZ produced a greater reduction in BP at 24 h, only ramipril treatment produced a decrease in LV mass (193 to 179 g, P < 0.005, v 184 to 182 g, P = NS), attributable to a reduction in wall thickness but not in chamber diameter. On multivariate analysis, both BP change and treatment group were independent predictors of LV mass change. Importantly, although neither drug reduced carotid artery cross-sectional area, relative wall thickness increased due to the tendency for vessel diameter to decrease and wall thickness to increase, particularly in the group. of diuretics. Ramipril caused a sustained fall in plasma angiotensin II, while HCTZ increased angiotensin II levels. Although diuretic therapy was more effective in lowering ambulatory BP in this predominantly nonwhite population, only ACE inhibitor therapy was associated with LV mass regression.

Once daily administration of 7.5 or 15 mg moexipril effectively lowers blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension (including the elderly and postmenopausal women with this condition). In double-blind randomized controlled trials, moexipril 7.5 to 15 mg once daily showed similar efficacy to other antihypertensive agents, including captopril, hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, metoprolol, sustained-release verapamil, and nitrendipine. Combination therapy with hydrochlorothiazide and moexipril had a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either agent alone. Moexipril is well tolerated by most patients and compares well with other antihypertensive agents in this regard. Its tolerability profile appears to be characteristic of ACE inhibitors as a class (the most common adverse events are headache, symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, and cough). Moexipril generally had no clinically significant effect on lipid, glucose, or electrolyte metabolism or haematological parameters and, in particular, was not associated with any significant change in lipid or glucose metabolism in postmenopausal women (with or without hormone replacement therapy); Once-daily moexipril is a useful agent for the treatment of essential hypertension, comparing well with currently available options in terms of clinical efficacy and tolerability.

ACE Inhibitor Myocardial Infarction Collaborative Group.",,,"Several large trials have shown improved survival with ACE inhibitor therapy initiated during acute myocardial infarction. A systematic review was carried out to resolve uncertainties regarding the time of onset, the time course of effect, and the identification of patients in whom benefits or risks may be greater; This overview aimed to include individual data from all randomized trials with more than 1000 patients in which ACE inhibitor treatment was started in the acute phase (0 to 36 hours) of myocardial infarction and continued for a period of time. short (4 to 6 weeks). Data were available for 98,496 patients from 4 eligible trials and results were consistent across trials. Mortality at 30 days was 7.1% among patients assigned to ACE inhibitors and 7.6% among control subjects, corresponding to a proportional reduction of 7% (SD, 2%) (95% CI, 2% to 11%; 2P<0.004). This represented approximately 5 (SD, 2) deaths averted per 1000 patients, with most of the benefit seen within the first week. The proportional benefit was similar in patients with different underlying risk. The absolute benefit was particularly large in some high-risk groups (ie, Killip class 2 to 3, heart rate > or = 100 bpm at admission) and in earlier MI. ACE inhibitor therapy also reduced the incidence of nonfatal heart failure (14.6% vs. 15.2%, 2P=0.01), but was associated with excess persistent hypotension (17.6% vs. to 9.3%, 2P<0.01) and renal dysfunction (1.3% vs. 0.6%, 2P<0.01).; These results support the early use of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, either in a wide range of patients or selectively in patients with prior myocardial infarction and those at increased risk of death.",0,0

Evaluation of Losartan in the Study of the Elderly.,,"Aronow, W S","Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists inhibit the renin-angiotensin system more completely than ACE inhibitors and do not increase bradykinin levels as do ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors have been shown to increase survival and improve quality of life in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). In the 48-week follow-up of the Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly (ELITE) study, the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (at a dose of 50 mg/day) was found to be superior to captopril 50 mg 3 times daily in terms of of its effects on total mortality, total mortality and/or hospitalization for CHF and hospitalization for any reason. Hospitalization for CHF was the same for both drugs. Adverse effects occurred in 12% and 21% of those receiving losartan and captopril, respectively. Cough, rash, angioedema, or taste disturbances/decreased appetite led to drug discontinuation in 0% and 7% of those receiving losartan and captopril, respectively. Until additional data become available, this author recommends that elderly patients with congestive heart failure and abnormal or normal left ventricular ejection fraction, and who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors, should receive losartan 50 mg/day. .",1,0
2386,9639376,Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase causes vasoconstriction of human resistance vessels in vivo.,,"Ferro, C J; Spratt, J C; Haynes, W G; Webb, D J","Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) degrades vasoactive peptides, including natriuretic peptides, angiotensin II, and endothelin-1. Systemic inhibition of NEP does not consistently lower blood pressure, but increases natriuretic peptide levels and causes natriuresis and diuresis. Therefore, we investigated the direct effects of local NEP inhibition on forearm resistance vessel tone; Four separate studies were conducted, each with 90-minute drug infusions. In the first study, 10 healthy subjects received a brachial artery infusion of the NEP inhibitor candoxatrilate (125 nmol/min), which caused slowly progressive forearm vasoconstriction (12+/-2%; P=0.001). In a second two-phase study, 6 healthy subjects received, 4 hours after enalapril (20 mg) or placebo, an intra-arterial infusion of the NEP inhibitor thiorphan (30 nmol/min). Thiorphan caused similar degrees of local forearm vasoconstriction (P=0.6) after pretreatment with placebo (13+/-1%, P=0.006) and enalapril (17+/-6%, P=0.05) . In a third three-phase study, 8 healthy subjects received intra-arterial thiorphan (30 nmol/min), the endothelin antagonist ETA BQ-123 (100 nmol/min), and both in combination. Thiorphan caused local vasoconstriction in the forearm (13+/-1%, P=0.0001); BQ-123 caused local vasodilation (33+/-3%, P=0.0001). Combined thiorphan and BQ-123 caused vasodilation (32+/-1%, P=0.0001) similar to BQ-123 alone (P=0.98). In a fourth study, 6 hypertensive patients (blood pressure >160/100 mm Hg) received intra-arterial thiorphan (30 nmol/min). Thiorphan caused slowly progressive forearm vasoconstriction (10+/-2%, P=0.0001); Inhibition of local NEP causes vasoconstriction in the resistance vessels of the forearm in both healthy volunteers and patients with hypertension. The lack of effect of ACE inhibition on thiorphan-induced vasoconstriction and its absence during concomitant ETA receptor blockade suggests that it is mediated by endothelin-1 and not by angiotensin II. These findings may help explain the failure of systemic NEP inhibition to lower blood pressure.",0,0

At the end of the study, HCTZ caused significantly greater increases from baseline in serum uric acid levels than moexipril (0.8 +/- 0.1 vs 0.1 +/- 0.1 mg/dl, p < 0 .01). In addition, 12-week treatment with HCTZ resulted in significant increases in glucose (+11.0 +/- 4.1 mg/dl) and total/HDL cholesterol ratio (+0.3 +/- 0.1 mg/dl) and a significant decrease in HDL (-3.2 +/- 0.7 mg/dl). In contrast, moexipril treatment was not associated with significant changes in any metabolic parameters. Both drugs effectively lowered SDBP with reductions of -10.0 +/- 1.3 and -11.8 +/- 1.1 mm Hg in the moexipril and HCTZ group, respectively. Clinical adverse events were reported by a higher percentage of patients on HCTZ (53%) than on moexipril (40%), with headache and rhinitis being the most frequent events.

We studied the effect of enalapril on left ventricular systolic function in terms of cardiac output and acceleration mean time measured by pulsed wave Doppler in the left ventricular outflow tract and peripheral resistance. Early inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme after acute myocardial infarction did not result in an overall improvement in cardiac output.

This is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, comparative study. Patients between 25 and 75 years of age with untreated hypertension with elevated diastolic blood pressure (> or = 95 mmHg) on three occasions (twice at the first visit and only once at the second and third visits) were recruited from a population-based survey. . After a 4-week placebo run-in, 71 patients were randomized to doses of 5-10 mg amlodipine or 10-20 mg lisinopril, which were titrated for effects on blood pressure. Fifty-nine patients completed the study period. Primary endpoints were left ventricular mass index and early peak atrial filling velocity. Office and ambulatory blood pressure and other echocardiographic measurements were considered secondary. The decrease in blood pressure was the same for both treatment regimens. A statistically significant decrease in left ventricular mass index was observed in both treatment groups: -11.0 g/m2 (95% CI: -6.0, -16.1) in the amlodipine group and -12.6 g/m2 (95% CI: -8.2, -17.0) in the lisinopril group.

ACE inhibitors have been reported to be superior to most other antihypertensive drugs in inducing regression of LVH. In a double-blind, parallel-group study, 50 patients with essential hypertension were randomized to receive treatment with fosinopril (20 mg once daily) or atenolol (50 mg once daily) for 12 to 16 weeks.

FBF was measured at normoinsulinemia and after 2 h of euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. Before treatment, the insulin-induced increase in FBF was inversely related to LVWT (r = -0.52, p < 0.02). The reduction in 24-hour ambulatory SBP/DBP was 13/9 mmHg for fosinopril and 15/14 for atenolol, with atenolol ambulatory DBP being significantly reduced (p = 0.03 for difference in treatment effect ). However, only fosinopril treatment produced a significant reduction in LVWT (from 20.5 mm to 19.4 mm, p < 0.05). The degree of reduction in LVWT was related to the increase in FBF in the fosinopril group (r = -0.45, p < 0.05). For fosinopril (but not atenolol), there was a positive relationship between change in E/A ratio and change in femoral artery stroke volume (r = 0.80, p < 0.01); Impaired insulin-induced stimulation of leg blood flow was associated with increased LVWT. Furthermore, during fosinopril treatment, LVWT regression was associated with increased skeletal muscle blood flow during hyperinsulinemia. This indicates that altered peripheral blood flow (and thus increased afterload) may be a possible mechanism explaining the previously found association between insulin resistance and cardiovascular hypertrophy.",0,0

The decrease in ambulatory BP induced by metoprolol correlated with the prolongation of the RR interval and the increase in high-frequency variability at supine rest. The present data show that 4-week treatment with metoprolol increases tonic and reflex cardiac vagal activity, whereas ramipril does not affect cardiac vagal control in essential hypertension. Increased vagal activity may contribute to the hypotensive effect of metoprolol in hypertensive patients.",0,0

This open-label study was conducted to assess the long-term efficacy, tolerability, and safety of these combinations. Patients in the factorial study were eligible for the 1-year open-label extension. Initially, all patients received enalapril 5 mg-felodipine ER 2.5 mg once daily; if DBP was not controlled (< 90 mm Hg) after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose was increased at 2-4 week intervals to a maximum of enalapril 10 mg-felodipine ER 10 mg.

Overall, 407 (81%) of 502 evaluable patients achieved SiDBP < 90 mm Hg or reduction from baseline > or = 10 mm Hg (responders); such response was recorded in 331 patients (66%) taking a combination of enalapril-felodipine ER alone and 76 patients (15%) taking the combination with the addition of HCTZ 12.5 mg. Blood pressure reductions were maintained throughout the treatment period. Drug-related adverse events were relatively infrequent, often transient, generally mild, and apparently unrelated to dose. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse events were edema/swelling, asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, cough, and headache. These results suggest that enalapril-felodipine ER combination therapy is effective for long-term blood pressure reduction, has an excellent safety profile, and is generally well tolerated.

The association between BP drop and baseline variables was weak. The strongest individual predictor of BP response was mean arterial pressure at baseline (r2 = 5.8%, P = 0.02). The best combinations of predictor variables contained mean arterial pressure, plasma renin activity, creatinine concentration, and age (r2 = 14.4%, P = 0.37). When the choice of ACE inhibitor was added, the predictive power of the model increased (r = 23.6%, P < 0.01), but left most of the variability in response unexplained; The first-dose blood pressure response to ACE inhibition cannot be accurately predicted from baseline pathophysiologic variables in patients with mild-to-moderate CHF. The choice of ACE inhibitor explains a small proportion of the variability in response, but there is wide interindividual variability in response to each treatment.",0,0

For each patient, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and echocardiographic determination of left ventricular mass index were performed at the end of a 4-week pretreatment washout period, after 3 and 12 months of treatment with lisinopril or with lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide and after a final 4-week placebo period. For each ambulatory blood pressure check, the 24-h average, the daytime average (0600-2400 h), the overnight average (2400-0600 h), and the day-night difference were calculated. The percentages of dipper and non-dipper patients (that is, patients with nocturnal blood pressure drops greater than and less than 10% of the daytime average, respectively) were also calculated; The reproducibility of the day-night difference was low, both for the comparison of the final pre-treatment and placebo periods (n = 170) and for the comparison of the third and twelfth months of treatment (n = 180). The reproducibility of the dipper-non-dipper dichotomy was also low, with 35-40% of patients becoming non-dipper if they were dipper and vice versa, both with and without treatment. Changes in left ventricular mass index after 12 months of treatment were significantly (P<0.01) with changes in 24 h, daytime and nighttime blood pressure (r always > 0.33), but not for the modification of the day-night difference induced by the treatment (r= -0.03 and -0.008 for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively); Our results show that the changes in blood pressure day-night and the classification of patients as dippers and non-dippers are poorly reproducible over time. It also provides the first prospective evidence that treatment-induced changes in blood pressure difference between day and night are unrelated to treatment-induced regression of left ventricular mass index, thus having clinical importance. limited.",0,0
2405,9671045,Acute hyponatremic encephalopathy after stroke.,,"Moussa, N A; Osman, A R; Yahya, T M","66-year-old hypertensive man with acute intracerebral hemorrhage developed an acute hyponatremic coma 3 days after adding enalapril and a combination of amiloride and a thiazide diuretic to his hypotensive regimen. The patient regained consciousness and serum sodium normalized 2 days after fluid restriction and withdrawal of both medications. Three weeks later, after inadvertent reinstitution of enalapril and indapamide, severe hyponatremic encephalopathy rapidly recurred; recovery was rapid again after fluid restriction and discontinuation of both medications. This temporal relationship establishes that either the thiazide diuretic or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or both are the cause of the profound symptomatic hyponatremia in this patient. The results of simultaneous serum and urine osmolality tests on several occasions were consistent with a decrease in free water clearance, as a result of increased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion or potentiation of its peripheral action, and Thiazide-induced natriuresis. The use of a thiazide diuretic in the presence of any of these aberrations of ADH homeostasis most likely explains the profound and rapid development of hyponatremia. Drug-induced alterations in serum osmolarity are a potentially reversible cause of impaired mental status in a patient with acute stroke.",0,0

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether antihypertensive drug therapy improves impaired endothelium-dependent renal vasorelaxation in essential hypertensive patients without atherosclerosis. We evaluated the effects of intravenous infusion of L-arginine (500 mg/kg administered over 30 minutes) on systemic and renal hemodynamics in 27 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension who were randomly assigned to treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor. of angiotensin imidapril or the calcium channel blocker amlodipine for 12 weeks in a double-blind manner. After 12 weeks, the decrease in blood pressure was similar in the imidapril (n=14) and amlodipine (n=13) groups. The increase in renal plasma flow was also similar in both groups. L-arginine-induced renovascular relaxation was increased by imidapril (renal plasma flow, 9.6+/-5.1% to 14.4+/-7.4%; renal vascular resistance, -10.4+/-8 .1% to -16.7+/-9.2%, P<0.05, respectively) but not by amlodipine. Urinary nitrite/nitrate excretion in response to L-arginine increased significantly with imidapril (90+/-29% to 134+/-63%, P<0.05), but remained unchanged with amlodipine.

Although the literature on LV mass reduction with antihypertensive therapy is extensive, little information is available on the effects of treatment on left atrial size; Patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 109 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to treatment with atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, hydrochlorothiazide, or prazosin in a double-blind trial. Two-dimensional directed M-mode echocardiography was used to assess left atrial size and LV mass at baseline, 8 weeks, and 1 and 2 years. Longitudinal analysis examined changes in left atrial size from the baseline study, statistically adjusting for age, race, pretreatment left atrial size, and LV mass, and serial measurements of systolic blood pressure, body weight, urinary sodium excretion, and physical activity score. Without adjustment for covariates, only hydrochlorothiazide was associated with decreases in left atrial size from baseline at 8 weeks (-1.0 +/- 5.2 mm; P = 0.052), 1 year (-2, 0 +/- 5.1 mm; P = 0.02), and 2 years (4.6 +/- 7.2 mm; P = 0.002). After adjusting for the effects of covariates, patients with normal left atrial size had a greater reduction (-3.3 mm) in left atrial size at 2 years with hydrochlorothiazide than with any other drug. For patients with left atrial enlargement, left atrial size decreased significantly with hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, clonidine, and diltiazem at 1 year and with all treatments at 2 years. However, the reduction at 2 years was greater with hydrochlorothiazide than with captopril or prazosin; Antihypertensive drugs differ in their effects on left atrial size. Hydrochlorothiazide was associated with a greater overall reduction in left atrial size than other effective drugs for the treatment of hypertension. The reduction in left atrial size with therapy is in part independent of factors known to influence left atrial size, including LV mass and reduction in LV mass with treatment. The clinical benefit of reducing left atrial size with antihypertensive treatment remains to be determined.",0,0

Arterial baroreflex control of heart rate was assessed by bolus phenylephrine. The arterial baroreflex test was re-examined 3 h after oral alacepril (37.5 mg). Tilt and arterial baroreflex tests were repeated 12 weeks after alacepril treatment (50 mg x day (-1)); Heart rate, blood pressure, and neurohormonal factors did not differ before and after chronic alacepril, except for a trend toward increased renin activity (2.0 vs. 4.9 ng x ml(-1) xh (-one)). Head tilt decreased central venous pressure (-2.5 mmHg) with decreased cardiac dimensions in the prealacepril phase. These changes were accompanied by increases in norepinephrine, epinephrine, and angiotensin II and a decrease in atrial natriuretic peptide.

It is the largest database of its kind in the world and around 35,000 new reports are added on a quarterly basis. A panel of experts has undertaken the task of trying to find new drug ADR signals, but with such a large volume of material, the task is daunting. We have developed a flexible and automated procedure to find new signals with a known probability difference from the background data; Data mining, using various computational approaches, has been applied in a variety of disciplines. A Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) has been developed that can handle large data sets, is robust in handling incomplete data, and can be used with complex variables. Using information theory, such a tool is ideal for finding drug-ADR combinations with other variables, which are highly associated compared to the generality of the stored data, or a section of the stored data. The method is transparent for easy verification and flexible for different types of searches; Using the BCPNN, some time scan examples are given showing the power of the technique to find early signs (captopril-cough) and to avoid false positives where a common drug and adverse reaction appear in the database (digoxin-acne). ; digoxin-rash) . A routine application of the BCPNN to a quarterly update is also tested, showing that 1004 suspected drug-ADR combinations met the 97.5% confidence level of difference from generality. Of these, 307 were potentially serious ADRs, and of these 53 were related to new medications. Twelve of the latter were not recorded in the CD editions of The medical's Desk Reference or Martindale's Extra Pharmacopoea and did not appear in Reactions Weekly online; The results indicate that the BCPNN can be used in detecting significant signals from the WHO Program on International Drug Monitoring dataset.

This report addresses whether the benefit of antihypertensive treatment varied by gender, prior cardiovascular complications, age, baseline blood pressure (BP), and smoking or drinking habits in an intention-to-treat analysis and explores whether morbidity outcomes and mortality were consistent. in a per protocol analysis; After stratification by center, gender, and cardiovascular complications, 4,695 patients aged 60 years and older with systolic BP 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic BP less than 95 mm Hg were randomized. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/d), with the possible addition of enalapril maleate (5-20 mg/d) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/d), titrated or combined to reduce systolic pressure in a sitting position.

2415,9704248,Comparative profile of tolerability of hypertensive crisis treatments.,,"Grossman, E; Ironi, A N; Messerli, F H","Hypertensive crisis is defined as a severe elevation in BP and is classified as urgency or emergency. In hypertensive urgency, there is no target organ injury and no evidence that acute BP reduction is beneficial. In fact, rapid and uncontrolled pressure reduction can be detrimental. Therefore, in hypertensive emergencies, BP should be lowered gradually over 24 to 48 hours using oral antihypertensives. When the cause of transient BP elevations is easily identified, appropriate treatment should be given. When the cause is unknown, an oral antihypertensive should be given. The efficacy of available treatments appears similar; however, the underlying pathophysiologic and clinical findings, mechanism of action, and potential for adverse effects should guide the choice. Captopril should be avoided in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral renal artery stenosis in patients with a solitary kidney. Nifedipine and other dihydropyridines increase heart rate while clonidine, beta-blockers, and labetalol tend to decrease it. This is particularly important in patients with ischemic heart disease. Labetalol and beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with bronchospasm and bradycardia or heart blocks. Clonidine should be avoided if mental acuity is desired. In the hypertensive emergency there is an immediate threat to the integrity of the cardiovascular system. BP must be lowered immediately to prevent further target organ damage. Sodium nitroprusside is the most popular agent. Nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) is preferred when acute coronary insufficiency is present. A beta blocker may be added in some patients. Loop diuretics, nitroglycerin, and sodium nitroprusside are effective in patients with concomitant pulmonary edema. Enalaprilat is also theoretically useful, especially when the renin system might be activated. Initial treatment of aortic dissection involves rapid and controlled titration of blood pressure to normal levels using intravenous sodium nitroprusside and a beta-blocker. If beta-blockers are contraindicated, urapidil or trimetaphan camsylate are alternatives. Hydralazine is the drug of choice for patients with eclampsia. Labetalol, urapidil, or calcium antagonists are possible alternatives if hydralazine fails or is contraindicated. For patients with catecholamine-induced seizures, an alpha-blocker such as phentolamine should be given; labetalol or sodium nitroprusside with beta blockers are alternatives. There are few, if any, comparative or randomized trials that provide definitive conclusions on the efficacy and safety of the comparative agents. Some investigators recommend lowering diastolic BP to no less than 100 to 110 mm Hg. A reasonable approach for most patients with hypertensive emergencies is to reduce mean arterial pressure by 25% during the initial 2 to 4 hours with the most specific antihypertensive regimen.",0,0

Primary analysis of PAA data revealed that both lisinopril and HCTZ effectively reduced mean 24-hour systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure compared to placebo (mean change from baseline SBP/DBP: - 12.0/-8.2, -10.6/-5.5 and -0.3/-0.5 mm Hg, respectively); however, lisinopril reduced DBP better than HCTZ (p < 0.05). Secondary group analyzes revealed that men responded better to lisinopril than HCTZ (-11.9/-7.3 vs -6.6/-3.5 mm Hg, respectively), while women responded well to both drugs. White patients responded better to lisinopril than HCTZ, while black patients showed a significant response only to HCTZ. Response to treatment was also influenced by the classification of patients' 24-hour blood pressure profiles, ie 'dipper' or 'non-dipper'. In general, most obese hypertensives were not dippers. Non-dippers (n = 82) responded well to both drugs (-10.4/-6.9 vs. -12.5/-5.7 mm Hg, P < 0.05 vs. placebo), whereas dippers (n = 42) responded to lisinopril (-11.7/-9.4 mm Hg, P < 0.05 vs. placebo and HCTZ), but not HCTZ (-5.6/-4.1 mm Hg, P = NS vs. placebo). Results from 24-hour PAA data show that both lisinopril and HCTZ are effective therapies for obesity-related hypertension and that response to treatment is influenced by gender, race, and dipper/non-dipper status.",0,0

The drugs most strongly associated with pancreatitis are sulfonamides, thiazides, furosemide, estrogens, and tetracycline. Approximately 100 cases of ACE inhibitor-induced pancreatitis have been reported to the US Food and Drug Administration, of which about 20 involved lisinopril. We present a case of pancreatitis that occurred just 3 hours after lisinopril intake in a man with no other risk factors for the disease. The patient had experienced a similar but less severe reaction to this drug 3 months earlier.

The EURODIAB controlled trial of lisinopril in IDDM is a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 530 non-hypertensive, mainly normoalbuminuric, IDDM patients aged 20 to 59 years. Albumin excretion rate (AER) was measured every 6 months for 2 years. The genotype distribution was 15% II, 58% ID and 27% DD. Between genotypes, there were no differences in baseline characteristics or changes in blood pressure and glycemic control throughout the trial. There was a significant interaction between genotype II and DD groups and treatment on change in AER (P = 0.05). Genotype II patients showed the fastest rate of AER progression with placebo, but had an improved response to lisinopril. The AER at 2 years (adjusted for baseline AER) was 51.3% lower with lisinopril than with placebo in genotype II patients (95% CI, 15.7 to 71.8; P = 0. 01), 14.8% in the ID group (-7.8 to 32.7; P = 0.2), and 7.7% in the DD group (-36.6 to 37.6; P = 0 ,7).

A negative interaction between aspirin and enalapril has been reported, presumably through aspirin's inhibition of ACE inhibitor-induced prostaglandin synthesis. Ticlopidine is a potent antiplatelet agent with no interaction with prostaglandin synthesis; The objective of this study was to compare the influence of the co-administration of ticlopidine or aspirin on the hemodynamic effects of an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) in patients with chronic heart failure. Twenty patients with severe heart failure were enrolled in a double-blind comparative trial and assigned to ticlopidine (500 mg daily, 12 patients) or aspirin (325 mg daily, 8 patients). Hemodynamic evaluation was performed after 7 days of treatment, every hour for 4 hours after oral administration of 10 mg enalapril. Significant reductions in systemic vascular resistance were observed in the ticlopidine group, in contrast to no significant reduction in the aspirin group. A significant interaction (P = 0.03) of time per treatment indicated a significant drug interaction between aspirin and enalapril. Total lung resistance decreased significantly in both groups, with no difference between patients assigned to aspirin or ticlopidine; Enalapril reduced systemic vascular resistance more effectively when given in combination with ticlopidine than with aspirin. In contrast, the reduction in total lung resistance is similar when enalapril is given in combination with aspirin or ticlopidine. The negative interaction between aspirin and enalapril on prostaglandin synthesis presumably alters vasodilation in systemic vessels, while prostaglandin-independent ACE-inhibiting actions, such as pulmonary arterial vasodilation, are maintained.",0,0

However, difficulties in measuring kinin concentrations have so far prevented the demonstration of an incontrovertible change in plasma bradykinin concentrations in these disorders. By developing a reliable assay we have been able to follow bradykinin concentrations during attacks and during remission in HA and AA, and also in a patient treated with an ACE inhibitor.; Liquid-phase extraction, high-performance liquid chromatography, and RIA were used for the specific measurement of plasma bradykinin concentrations in 22 HA patients and 22 healthy volunteers of similar age and sex distribution. Four patients with AA and one hypertensive patient treated with the ACE inhibitor captopril were also studied; Among healthy volunteers, plasma bradykinin concentration was inversely proportional to age. Geometric mean plasma bradykinin concentration in healthy volunteers was 2.2 fmol/mL (SD 2.2), compared with 3.9 fmol/mL (3.7) among AH patients during remission (p=0.095). Bradykinin was also elevated in patients with AA (10.4 fmol/mL [1.6]). During acute attacks of edema, in both HA and AA, plasma bradykinin increased from two to 12 times the upper limit of normal. Infusion of C1-esterase inhibitor (the factor deficient in both HA and AA) immediately reduced bradykinin levels. In the patient who received the ACE inhibitor captopril, the bradykinin level was very high, 47 fmol/mL during an acute attack of angioedema, but normal, 3.2 fmol/mL in remission after drug withdrawal; A sensitive method for measuring plasma bradykinin provided the means to show that concentrations of this peptide decline with age in healthy people.

The study included 175 subjects (mean age +/- SD, 51 +/- 9 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension who had echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy taken from the SAMPLE study (Study on Ambulatory Monitoring of Blood Pressure and Lisinopril Evaluation), an open multicentre study. The study included a 3-week washout pretreatment period, a 12-month treatment period with once-daily lisinopril (n=84) or lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide (n=91), and a 4-week placebo follow-up period. . Results of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and echocardiographic determination of left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were obtained before and after 3 and 12 months of treatment. T/Ps were calculated for each patient by dividing the systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes at trough (changes in the last 2 hours of the monitoring period) by those at peak (average of the adjacent 2 hours with reduction maximum blood pressure between the 2nd and 8th hour after taking the drug) after 3 and 12 months of treatment. Average 24-hour blood pressure was similarly reduced at 3 and 12 months. The minimum changes in blood pressure at 3 and 12 months were closely related, as were the corresponding maximum changes in blood pressure. However, the T/P of 3 and 12 months were less correlated (r<0.42). In addition, treatment-induced reduction in LVMI correlated similarly with treatment-induced reduction in 24-hour mean, minimum, and maximum blood pressure, but not with T/P. This was also evident when the contribution to regression of LV hypertrophy by changes in 24-hour blood pressure and T/Ps was assessed in a multivariable regression analysis. In patients with T/P >/=0.5 or <0.5, LVMI regression was similar. In conclusion, changes in trough and trough blood pressure are reproducible and predictive of treatment-induced LVMI regression as well as 24-hour mean blood pressure. The T/P are less reproducible and their value does not predict the regression of organ damage due to antihypertensive treatment.",0,0

The available data do not conclusively define the effect of atrial fibrillation on the prognosis of heart failure; We performed a retrospective analysis of left ventricular dysfunction prevention and treatment studies comparing patients with atrial fibrillation with those in sinus rhythm at baseline for risk of all-cause mortality, death from progressive pump failure and arrhythmic death.; Compared with those in sinus rhythm, patients with atrial fibrillation at baseline had higher all-cause mortality (34% vs. 23%, p < 0.001), death attributed to pump failure (16.7% vs. 9.4%, p < 0.001) and were more likely to reach the composite end point of death or hospitalization for heart failure (45% vs 33%, p < 0.001), but there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of to deaths from arrhythmia. After multivariate analysis, atrial fibrillation remained significantly associated with all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12 to 1.62, p = 0.002) , death due to progressive pump failure (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.85, p=0.01), the composite endpoint of death or hospitalization for heart failure (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.42, p=0.02), but not arrhythmic death (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.71, p=0.55).; The presence of atrial fibrillation in patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, largely explained by an increased risk of death from pump failure. These data suggest that atrial fibrillation is associated with the progression of left ventricular systolic dysfunction.",0,0

The controversy over calcium channel blockers (CCBs) over the past 3 years has provided a natural experiment that allows for impact assessment of media stories, a national warning letter, a teleconference, small group workshops and informative bulletins on the prescription of first-line antihypertensives. drugs.; We included all physicians (4,403) in British Columbia who prescribed a thiazide diuretic, beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or CCB as the first antihypertensive agent to 36,507 residents aged 66 years or older, without previous experience or concurrent sign of underlying cardiovascular disease. We used a database that covered all prescriptions to older people to measure the change in the proportion of recently treated patients who received each drug class as first-line therapy. We used a matched cohort design for the evaluation of the teleconference and workshops, a randomized community design for the newsletters, and time series analyzes for media impacts; The proportion of patients receiving a CCB as first-line therapy gradually decreased from 22% in early 1994 to 15% in late 1996. This proportion was not affected by two waves of adverse news about CCBs in 1995, but fell 5% for 5 months and 3% for 1 month after two waves in 1996. The proportion of patients who received a CCB or an ACE inhibitor as first-line treatment, contrary to guidelines, was still 42% generally in 1996. Workshops and bulletins were followed by changes from first-line CCBs to prescription first-line thiazides; Changes in prescribing practices occur gradually with the accumulation of small impacts from educational interventions and media attention.",0,0

After a 3-week placebo period, patients were treated for 16 weeks with trandolapril, 2 to 4 mg/day. UAE and blood pressure (mercury sphygmomanometer and 24-h ABPM) were measured at baseline and repeated with trandolapril. Predictors of abnormal UAE (24-h UAE > or = 30 mg) were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis (logistic regression). Predictors of UAE decline were also sought. One hundred seventy-one patients entered the analysis. Baseline office BP was 164+/-14/97+/-6 mm Hg and 24-h BP was 142+/-17/83+/-10 mm Hg. Seventy-four patients (43%) had UAE > or = 30 mg. Independent risk factors for abnormal UAE were overnight diastolic BP (odds ratio [OR] = 4.1, confidence interval [CI] = 2.0 to 8.6, P = 0.0001), duration of diabetes (OR=2.4, CI=1.1 to 5.0, P=0.025) and presence of retinopathy (OR=3.2, CI=1.0 to 10.0, P=0.047). In contrast, the level of PA in the office was not significantly related to UAE. During treatment, office BP levels decreased to 143+/-13/82+/-8 mm Hg (P < 0.0001) and 24-hour BP levels to 134+/-17/78+ /-9 mm Hg (P < .0001). In the abnormal EAU group, EAU decreased significantly from 76 to 50 mg/day (P = 0.006). After treatment, independent predictors of abnormal UAE were: fasting plasma glucose on drug (OR = 3.5, CI = 1.7 to 7.4, P = 0.0009) and overnight diastolic BP on drug (OR = 3.5, CI = 1.7 to 7.4). , p = 0.001). The only predictor of decrease in UAE was a decrease in 24-hour systolic BP (OR = 2.3, CI = 1.3 to 4.3, P = 0.007). We conclude that in diabetic hypertensives with abnormal UAE, trandolapril exhibited a 24-hour sustained antihypertensive effect and provided a consistent reduction in microalbuminuria. This study confirmed the superiority of ABPM over clinical BP in predicting target organ damage.",0,0

Therefore, we conducted this study in patients with non-diabetic kidney disease and proteinuria. After a 4-week washout period in which patients were not using any medications that affected proteinuria, 21 patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive the calcium channel blocker amlodipine (Amlo, 5 to 10 mg) or the ACE inhibitor lisinopril (Lis, 5 to 10 mg). Throughout the 16-week study period, blood pressure, creatinine clearances, and proteinuria were measured every 2 weeks. In addition, renal hemodynamic and blood pressure studies measured by the device were performed at the beginning and at the end of the study. Systolic blood pressure fell in the Lis group from 163+/-7 (SEM) to 140+/-8 mm Hg (P < 0.01) and from 157+/-10 to 147+/-6 mm Hg in the Amlo group; diastolic blood pressure fell from 101+/-3 to 86+/-7 mm Hg in the Lis group and from 98+/-3 to 91+/-2 mm Hg in the Amlo group. Renal hemodynamics were not affected by amlodipine treatment, while a drop in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was observed in patients treated with lisinopril (from 55+/-11 to 50+/-10 ml/min , p < 0.01). Amlodipine did not significantly affect proteinuria. Lisinopril induced a decrease in the protein-to-creatinine ratio with a maximum effect reached after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment (from 0.39 +/- 0.17 to 0.26 +/- 0.11 g/mmol; P < 0.009). In conclusion, we were unable to demonstrate an antiproteinuric effect of the long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine, whereas therapy with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril resulted in decreased proteinuria. Amlodipine did not affect renal hemodynamics, while lisinopril induced a drop in GFR.",0,0

A fixed low-dose combination of these two agents has been proposed in the treatment of hypertension. We evaluated this combination in 26 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and mild to severe chronic renal failure who did not require dialysis. This was an open-label, multicentre trial consisting of a 2-week single-blind placebo washout period followed by 12 weeks of active treatment. At week 0, patients received perindopril 2 mg/indapamide 0.625 mg once daily or every other day, with the possibility of dose adjustment to perindopril 4 mg/indapamide 1.25 mg at week 2, 4 or 8 Pharmacokinetic analysis using a population pharmacokinetic approach at week 8. Twenty-three patients completed the 12-week study, at which time 14 patients were receiving perindopril 2 mg/indapamide 0.625 mg daily, three were receiving perindopril 2 mg /0.625 mg of indapamide every other day, and six perindopril 4 mg/indapamide 1.25 mg. Blood pressure readings (supine) decreased from 170.4+/-19.2/101.5+/-6.7 mm Hg before active treatment to 146.5+/-19.7/86, 5+/-10.6 mm Hg at the end of treatment (P < 0.0001). Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that for indapamide and perindoprilat (the active metabolite of perindopril) the area under the curve (AUC24) increased with the severity of renal impairment. No interaction between the two drugs was observed. Mean serum creatinine and serum sodium and potassium levels remained stable throughout the study. Impairment of renal function occurred in one patient and was considered unrelated to treatment. We conclude that a fixed combination of perindopril-indapamide at low doses as first-line treatment has a good safety/efficacy ratio in hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure.",0,0

The renin-angiotensin system is activated in chronic heart failure. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improves symptoms and prognosis. The aim of this study was to quantify and localize skeletal muscle ACE mRNA in chronic heart failure patients and control subjects, and to elucidate skeletal muscle fiber area and capillary density.; Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were taken from 9 patients before and after enalapril treatment and from 10 control subjects. ACE-mRNA was quantified with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize ACE within skeletal muscle. No differences in ACE mRNA transcripts were detected between patients and control subjects, nor did ACE gene expression change after enalapril treatment. The number of ACE-mRNA transcripts was related to muscle fiber area, whereas an inverse relationship was found between the number of ACE transcripts and capillary density. ACE was detected in the endothelial cells of capillaries in skeletal muscle.; ACE is expressed in skeletal muscle and is restricted to endothelial cells. The close relationship between capillary density and the number of ACE transcripts indicates that activation of the renin-angiotensin system has an impact on capillary growth.",0,0

The patients were hospitalized and the controls were not. They were randomly matched based on contemporaneous eligibility for Medicaid benefits. Hospitalization odds ratios were compared for patients exposed to known drug interactions with those for patients exposed to one of the interacting agents. When the confidence intervals did not overlap, the odds ratio was considered to be significantly increased. The odds ratios were significantly increased for many interacting drug pairs and were associated with commonly recognized as well as less recognized interactions. Cimetidine interactions achieved significance only with theophylline. In the Medicaid population, exposure to a number of drug interactions was associated with a significantly increased risk of hospitalization.",0,0

Twenty-three untreated middle-aged hypertensive patients were evaluated for EDV and endothelium-independent vasodilation (EIDV) in the forearm by local intra-arterial infusions of methacholine (MCh, evaluating EDV) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, evaluating EIDV). ), before and 1 h after the intake of captopril (25 mg) or nifedipine (10 mg) in a randomized, double-blind fashion. A matched normotensive control group was investigated under baseline conditions only. Five of the hypertensives were also evaluated after 3 months of treatment with captopril 25 mg twice daily in an open-label pilot study. First, methacholine (MCh), but not SNP-induced vasodilation, was significantly attenuated in hypertensive patients compared with normotensive controls (P < 0.001 at MCh 4 microg/min). Second, although the two drugs induced a similar decrease in blood pressure (BP) 1 h after administration (-11 to 10 mm Hg/-8 to 7 mm Hg), captopril significantly potentiated the vasodilator response to MCh ( +32+/- 13%, MCh 4 microg/min, P < 0.01) but no SNP, whereas nifedipine did not significantly alter the response to MCh or SNP. The improvement in vasodilator response to MCh induced by captopril was closely related to the reduction in BP (r = 0.72, P < 0.01). Third, in the pilot study, 3 months of captopril treatment induced a significant potentiation of the vasodilator response to MCh (+34+/-17%, MCh 4 microg/min, P < 0.05) in parallel with a significant reduction in BP (-22+/-24/13+/-13 mm Hg, P < 0.05), while the response to SNP did not change. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that essential hypertension is associated with a defect in EDV. Furthermore, an improvement in EDV was observed in hypertensive patients shortly after administration of captopril, but not nifedipine. Furthermore, a significant beneficial effect on EDV was observed in a small pilot study during long-term treatment with captopril.",0,0
2445,9759987,The direct costs to the NHS of stopping and changing prescriptions for hypertension.,,"Hughes, D; McGuire, A","There is much evidence to suggest that the treatment of hypertension reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and that it is cost-effective in most patients. However, the effectiveness of treatment depends on compliance and maintenance of treatment. Each pharmacological agent differs in terms of side effects. The existence of side effects can lead to poor compliance and switching between treatments. Several studies have reported high rates of discontinuation of antihypertensive therapies. This potentially imposes costs on the health service. The objective of this study is to use the MEDIPLUS dataset to consider the cost of switching and discontinuation of therapy. The analysis will assess resource costs in terms of additional GP visits and hospitalizations resulting from changes and interruptions in people's treatments. The total costs of hypertension were estimated to be around £76.5 million per year, of which £26.9 million can be attributed to patients switching or stopping treatment.",0,0

Intraoperatively, increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) >85 mmHg or >80 mmHg during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) were treated with a bolus of urapidil. The total intraoperative amount of urapidil was documented for both groups. Systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics, as well as plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, arginine vasopressin, and renin were measured intraoperatively and up to 2 h after admission to the intensive care unit; Mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, and systemic vascular resistance did not differ between the enalaprilat and control groups. Plasma renin levels increased significantly after enalaprilat infusion and did not change in the placebo group. Plasma levels of catecholamines and arginine vasopressin increased significantly during ECC and remained high in the postoperative period with no difference between groups.

Twenty-eight mildly to moderately overweight hypertensives [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >90 and <110 mm Hg] aged 43 to 64 years, after a 4-week placebo period, were randomized to receive perindopril, 4 mg once daily, or losartan, 50 mg once daily, for 6 weeks. Then, after another placebo period, patients were switched to the alternative regimen for a further 6 weeks. At the end of the placebo and treatment periods, blood pressure was measured, plasma fibrinogen was assessed, and insulin sensitivity was assessed by euglycemic and hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. Glucose infusion rate (GIR) during the last 30 min of clamping and total glucose requirement (TGR) were assessed. Both perindopril and losartan reduced SBP (by a mean of 20.2 mm Hg, p < 0.001 vs. placebo, and 15.8 mm Hg, p = 0.002 vs. placebo, respectively) and DBP (by a mean of 15 .2mm Hg, p = 0.001). vs placebo and 11.8 mm Hg, p = 0.01 vs placebo respectively), with no difference between the two treatments. GIR was significantly increased with perindopril (+2.91 mg/min/kg, p = 0.042 vs. placebo), but not with losartan (+0.28 mg/min/kg, NS). The TGR was not modified by losartan but was increased by perindopril (+9.3 g, p = 0.042 vs. placebo). Plasma fibrinogen levels were reduced with perindopril (-53.4 mg/dl, p = 0.022 vs. placebo), but not with losartan (-16.8 mg/dl, NS). The decrease in fibrinogen induced by perindopril correlated with the increase in GIR (r = 0.39, p < 0.01). These findings suggest that the decrease in fibrinogen produced by the ACE inhibitor is related to its action on insulin sensitivity, which seems to depend not on angiotensin II blockade but on other mechanisms.",0,0
2458,9783490,Adaptation of antihypertensive treatment in the elderly.,,"Bonapace, S; Rajkumar, C; Bulpitt, C J","Treatment of hypertension in the elderly must take into account coexisting pathology. However, the benefit of treatment is great due to the frequency of cardiovascular events in the elderly. Benefits seen in randomized controlled trials are reviewed along with adverse effects of individual treatments. The optimal use of antihypertensive treatment is considered in the face of any concomitant disease; for example, beta blockers or calcium channel blockers when angina is present and avoid diuretics in the presence of gout. Important dangerous drug interactions are also discussed. It is concluded that diuretics continue to be the first option in uncomplicated hypertension and the least expensive. However, the place of antihypertensive treatment is not established in patients older than 80 years.",0,0

PROGRESS Management Committee.,,,"The study has been designed to assess the efficacy of blood pressure (BP) lowering in stroke prevention in patients with a history of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischemic attack.; An international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril, alone or in combination with the diuretic indapamide, in the secondary prevention of stroke and other major cardiovascular events.; A total of 6000 normotensive or hypertensive patients with a history of stroke or transient cerebral ischemia in the previous 5 years will be included in the study. The study is being conducted at more than 160 centers located in seven regions: Australia and New Zealand; The People's Republic of China; France and Belgium; Italy; Japan; Sweden; and the UK. The main outcome of the study is the total number of strokes defined by the WHO criteria. Secondary outcomes include fatal and disabling strokes, total number of cardiovascular events and deaths, cognitive function, disability, and dependency. A minimum follow-up of 4 years is anticipated.; As of March 27, 1997, 173 local clinical centers in seven regions had been registered. A total of 5,268 patients (64% with a history of hypertension or baseline BP values greater than 95 mm Hg [diastolic] or 160 mm Hg [systolic]) were randomly assigned to active treatment or placebo. After 6 months of follow-up, the difference in BP between the treatment and control groups was 10.2/4.5 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). Sixty-three strokes (two fatal) and 20 myocardial infarctions (four fatal) had been recorded; The viability of the study is now assured, with almost 90% of the 6000 patients recruited. ACE therapy with perindopril is well tolerated in the population studied. The BP differences between the control and treatment groups and the event rates recorded to date suggest that the study will achieve its primary goals.",0,0

No patient had previously received antihypertensive agents before this study began. After a 2-week follow-up period, we performed ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in 86 patients with essential hypertension (WHO stage I or II). Patients then received a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (captopril or imidapril), a beta-receptor blocker (arotinolol or bisoprolol), or a calcium channel blocker (nisoldipine or benidipine) twice. times a day to check BP. We evaluated the patients' BP once every 2 weeks to ensure optimal control. After 12 weeks, ultradian and circadian variations in BP were analyzed using the maximum entropy method (MEM). All antihypertensive agents reduced office systolic BP (SBP), office diastolic BP (DBP), 24-hour SBP, and 24-hour DBP. ACE inhibitors did not change pulse rate (PR) in the office, 24 hours, day or night. Arotinolol and bisoprolol decreased the 24-h PR. All antihypertensive agents decreased the product of the 24-hour, diurnal, and nocturnal blood pressure rate. MEM showed that no antihypertensive agent affected the circadian variation in the first peak (periodicity of 24 h) of SBP, DBP or PR. However, calcium channel blockers shortened the periodicity of circadian variations in the second peak (12-hour period) of SBP and the third peak (8- to 6-hour period) of SBP. Therefore, ultradian BP variations should be carefully monitored in hypertensive patients treated with calcium channel blockers.",0,0

Factors possibly responsible for the large interpatient variation in antiproteinuric effect (PSA) have not yet been investigated in renal transplant patients; 28 patients after KTx with persistent proteinuria greater than 1.25 g/d were prospectively treated with doses of fosinopril (10-15 mg/d) that were not effective on systemic blood pressure. Before starting treatment with fosinopril, a renal graft biopsy was performed in all patients and renal graft artery stenosis was ruled out by duplex ultrasound. Serum creatinine and proteinuria were measured before, as well as 3 and 8 months after the start of ACE inhibition, mean arterial pressure was monitored by 24-hour measurements and repeated spot measurements. The reduction in proteinuria was correlated with renal histology, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, mean arterial pressure, sodium excretion before treatment, and relative changes of these parameters during treatment, respectively. Treatment had to be discontinued in 8/28 patients due to side effects, including increased serum creatinine (n = 4). Three patients were excluded for noncompliance. In the remaining patients (n = 17) proteinuria was reduced from 2.94 +/- 1.66 to 1.82 +/- 1.39 and 2.48 +/- 3.05 g/d after 3 and 8 months respectively, in the mean +/- SD. There was a significant inverse correlation between PSA and the extent of benign nephrosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. No correlation of PSA with any of the other parameters could be demonstrated; Fosinopril can be administered effectively in a subgroup of proteinuric renal transplant recipients. However, because a high proportion of patients develop side effects, careful monitoring is mandatory. Our results show that the lower the degree of chronic morphological injury, the greater the antiproteinuric effect. Therefore, the degree of histologically proven preexisting graft damage can serve as an indicator of the antiproteinuric efficacy of ACE inhibitor therapy after RTx.",0,0

At the end of the main study, patients continued or switched to ramipril and were formally enrolled in the follow-up REIN study; 97 patients entered the follow-up study. Patients originally randomized to ramipril continued on the same daily dose (n=51), while those originally receiving placebo plus conventional antihypertensive drugs switched to ramipril after the first follow-up study visit (n=46). Ramipril (1.25 to 5.00 mg/day) and conventional antihypertensive therapy were aimed at achieving a diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. The main efficacy variables were the decrease in GFR and ESRF (need for dialysis). Analysis was by intention to treat.; During the follow-up study, the mean rate of decline in GFR per month decreased from 0.44 (SD 0.54) mL/min per 1.73 m2 in the core study to 0.10 (0.50) mL/min. min per 1.73 m2 in patients originally randomized to ramipril (p = 0.017) and from 0.81 (1.12) to 0.14 (0.87) mL/min per 1.73 m2 in those originally randomized to placebo plus conventional antihypertensive treatment (p=0.017).

Beyond the 36-month follow-up, the incidence of ESRF was zero in patients originally randomized to ramipril but 30% in patients on placebo plus conventional antihypertensive therapy; In patients with chronic kidney disease at high risk of rapid progression to ESRF, ramipril reversed the tendency for GFR to decline over time. In addition, a treatment period of sufficient duration (> or = 36 months) eliminated the need for dialysis. Even patients previously treated with antihypertensive drugs other than ACE inhibitors benefited from switching to ramipril.",0,0

The mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors and AII antagonists improve CE remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis that the improvement in CE is related to shifts in skeletal muscle composition toward type I fibers; Eight patients with congestive heart failure, NYHA classes I to IV, were treated for 6 months with enalapril (E) 20 mg/day and another 8 with losartan (L) 50 mg/day. CE was assessed with maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests at baseline and after treatment. Gastrocnemius myosin heavy chain (MHC) composition was studied after electrophoretic separation of slow MHC1, fast oxidative MHC2a, and fast glycolytic MHC2b isoforms from needle microbiopsies obtained at baseline and after 6 months. CE improved in both groups. Peak V(O2) increased from 21.0+/-4.7 to 27.6+/-4.3 mL. kg-1 . min -1 (P=0.011) in the L group and from 17.5+/-5.0 to 25.0+/-5.5 mL. kg-1 . min -1 (P=0.014) in group E.

Similarly, MHC2a decreased from 21.20+/-9.5% to 12.9+/-4 0.4% (P=0.05) with L and from 19.9+/-7.8% to 11.8+/-7.9% (P=0.06) with E.

There was a significant correlation between net changes in MHC1 and absolute changes in V(O2) peak (r2=0.29, P=0.029) and a trend towards significance for MHC2a and 2b .; Six-month treatment with L and E produced an improvement in CD of a similar magnitude. These changes are accompanied by a reorientation of leg skeletal muscle MHCs toward slower and more fatigue-resistant isoforms. The magnitude of the MHC1 changes correlates with the net maximal V(O2) gain, suggesting that the improvement in CE may be due to favorable biochemical changes occurring in skeletal muscle.",0,0

2467,9793603,Losartan as an alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients with renal dysfunction.,,"Esmail, Z N; Loewen, P S","Losartan-induced acute renal failure may occur in patients sensitive to reduced renal plasma flow. Such patients include those with bilateral renal artery stenosis, severe congestive heart failure, and severe sodium and volume depletion because their renal function is often dependent on angiotensin. Theoretically, both ACE inhibitors and losartan could negatively affect kidney function in such sensitive patients. The ELITE trial showed a 10.5% incidence of losartan-induced renal dysfunction in elderly patients with congestive heart failure without known underlying renal dysfunction, an incidence identical to that of captopril. A review of the literature revealed no controlled trials specifically addressing whether losartan can be used as an alternative in patients in whom losartan-associated renal dysfunction has been reported and identified an additional case report from a local adverse reaction monitoring program. to medications. There were two cases of patients who developed renal dysfunction while receiving ACE inhibitors and then losartan. We found only one published case in which losartan was used without renal function impairment in patients who developed renal dysfunction while taking an ACE inhibitor, although underreporting of these cases would be expected. There was one case of renal dysfunction with losartan after the lack of renal dysfunction while the patient was taking an ACE inhibitor. The remaining three reports are from patients who developed renal dysfunction while taking losartan with no history of ACE inhibitor use. All case reports describe renal impairment that was reversible on discontinuation of the triggering agent, either an ACE inhibitor or losartan. All but two patients (personal communication, Barbara Cadario) had underlying renal pathology. Although there is a paucity of published literature and the clinical experience of some may suggest otherwise, there is currently no evidence (with the exception of 1 case report) to suggest that losartan is better tolerated than ACE inhibitors from the point of view of kidney toxicity. The available evidence suggests that this is equally true in patients with and without underlying renal dysfunction. Furthermore, case reports suggest that, as with ACE inhibitors, losartan should be avoided in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis and in patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney. In patients with underlying renal dysfunction, regardless of whether they tolerate ACE inhibitors, losartan can be used if considered necessary. Renal function should be monitored and losartan should be discontinued if evidence of renal dysfunction is evident, as several case reports and one randomized trial suggest that losartan may cause the same negative renal effects as ACE inhibitors.",0,0

Patients received placebo or candesartan cilexetil 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg once daily for 8 weeks. All doses of candesartan cilexetil significantly reduced (24 hours after treatment) sitting systolic and diastolic BP compared to placebo (p < 0.005). A significant dose response (p < or = 0.0001) was evident, with greater decreases in BP at higher doses. Mean changes in BP were -10.7/-7.8 mm Hg and -12.6/-10.2 mm Hg in the 16 and 32 mg groups, respectively, versus -0.3/-2 .6 mm Hg in the placebo group. Doses of 16 and 32 mg were consistently significantly superior to placebo in antihypertensive effect with respect to all BP measurements, including peak (6 hours post-treatment), trough, sitting and standing diastolic BP measurements and systolic Response rates (sitting trough diastolic BP < 90 or > or = 10 mm Hg BP decrease) were 54% and 64% for the 16 and 32 mg groups, respectively. The tolerability and safety profiles were similar to placebo at all doses. In conclusion, once-daily candesartan cilexetil effectively lowers BP in a dose-dependent manner while maintaining safety and tolerability; doses of 16 and 32 mg are the most effective for the treatment of hypertension.",0,0

The effects of nitrendipine compared to enalapril and of enalapril compared to placebo were similarly defined. Left ventricular mass was measured by M-mode echocardiography; The use of nitrendipine and enalapril led to significant and nearly identical reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Over 48 weeks, left ventricular mass index decreased by 5% in patients in the nitrendipine group (12 g/m2 decrease, 95% confidence interval 1-23), remained approximately the same for patients in the nitrendipine group. of enalapril (decrease of 1 g/m2). m2, 95% confidence interval decrease by 10 to increase by 9) and 9% increase for patients in the placebo group (9 g/m2 increase, 95% confidence interval 2-16); These results indicate that the administration of nitrendipine to patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension reduces the left ventricular mass index.

A centralized review committee has validated a sample pre-study echocardiogram from each center and is now reviewing all videotapes recorded during this study for quality control; the final results will be based on further randomized blind analysis conducted by this centralized evaluation committee; Since December 1994, 878 patients have been preselected (video echocardiographic recordings sent for evaluation), 645 selected (video echocardiographic recordings validated), and 576 randomized to treatment. After preliminary quality control, 27% (233) of baseline echocardiograms were rejected by our centralized review board, and 22% (142) of post-enrollment echocardiograms had to be repeated, mainly because they were of poor quality. echogenic.

Casual and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (24hBP) decreased from 163/95 to 144/83 mm Hg and from 152/86 to 145/81 mm Hg, respectively, in the captopril group, and from 160/93 to 145/86 mm Hg and 156/86 to 147/79 mm Hg in the doxazosin group (all P < 0.05). The 24hBP achieved on treatment was positively associated with pretreatment levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (r = 0.53 and 0.59, respectively, both P < 0.01). Albuminuria did not change significantly in either group. Left ventricular hypertrophy was present in 13 patients (7 in the captopril group and 6 in the doxazosin group). Left ventricular mass was reduced by an average of 27% and 23%, respectively, in these patients (both P < 0.01), but did not change significantly in patients without left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular mass reduction was positively associated with the presence of baseline left ventricular hypertrophy and inversely with dietary sodium intake and casual blood pressure achieved in treatment (R2 = 0.59, P < 0.001). We conclude that doxazosin and captopril used for 6 months are equally effective in reducing blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive type 1 diabetic patients; the antihypertensive effect is closely related to glycemic control; and dietary sodium intake and casual blood pressure achieved after treatment are independent determinants of the reduction in left ventricular mass observed in these patients.",0,0

Elderly patients with heart failure are routinely treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which may increase the risk of renal dysfunction. We investigated the frequency of renovascular disease among elderly with heart failure.; From the local population of Salford, UK, we recruited 86 heart failure patients with a mean age of 77.5 (SD 5.6) years, admitted as acute emergencies or attending general medical clinics. We selected patients by intention to treat with ACE inhibitors. We use captopril renography to detect renovascular disease. All patients with abnormal renograms underwent magnetic resonance angiography of the renal arteries, as well as 40% of patients with normal renograms as negative controls.; Magnetic resonance angiography showed severe renovascular disease (>50% renal artery stenosis or occlusion) in 29 (34%) patients. Captopril renography had an estimated sensitivity of 78.8% (95% CI: 72.7-97.8) and specificity of 94.3% (67.6-97.3) for the detection of renovascular disease . The estimated positive predictive value of captopril renography was 89.7% and the negative predictive value was 87.5%. Patients with renovascular disease had worse renal function (mean creatinine 201 [SD 56] vs 136 [40] pmol/L, p<0.001), were older (mean age 80.7 [5.6] vs 76.8 [5.3] years, p<0.01), and were more likely than patients without renovascular disease to have peripheral arterial disease.; Some elderly patients with occult renovascular disease treated with ACE inhibitors will be at risk of developing uremia.

The Vascular Dementia Project, established as part of the double-blind, placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) trial, investigated whether treatment with antihypertensive drugs could reduce the incidence of dementia.; Eligible patients did not have dementia, were at least 60 years old, and had a sitting blood pressure of 160-219 mm Hg systolic and less than 95 mm Hg diastolic. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), or both drugs, titrated or combined to reduce systolic blood pressure. pressure by at least 20 mm Hg to reach a value below 150 mm Hg. Cognitive function was assessed using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). If the MMSE score was equal to or less than 23, diagnostic tests for dementia were performed (DSM-III-R criteria). The cause of dementia was established using the modified ischemic score with brain imaging or the Hachinski score.; The median intention-to-treat follow-up was 2.0 years. Compared with placebo (n=1,180), active treatment (n=1,238) reduced the incidence of dementia by 50%, from 7.7 to 3.8 cases per 1,000 patient-years (21 vs. 11 patients, p=0.05).

A possible association of calcium channel blocker use with cancer incidence and cancer mortality was addressed using data from the Nurses' Health Study.; In this study, a total of 18,635 nurses reported regularly taking at least 1 of 4 cardiovascular medications in 1988: diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Cancer incidence and cancer deaths were determined up to 1994; During 6 years of follow-up, 852 women were newly diagnosed with cancer and 335 women died of cancer. Women who reported the use of calcium channel blockers had no increased risk of newly diagnosed cancer compared with those taking other cardiovascular medications (relative risk = 1.02, 95% CI 0.83 to 1, 26). The relative risk of dying from cancer associated with self-reported use of calcium channel blockers was 1.25 (95% CI: 0.91-1.72).

Sixty-three percent of patients were treated with dihydropyridine CCB. During follow-up, patients treated with CCBs compared with those who did not receive CCBs had higher proteinuria (mean +/- SEM: 4.8 +/- 0.2 g/24 h versus 4.2 +/- 0 .2 g/24 h, respectively, P = 0.015) and mean arterial BP (MAP). The difference in proteinuria was significant in the placebo group (5.1+/-0.2 g/24 h versus 4.3+/-0.3 g/24 h, P = 0.02), but not in the ACEI group (4.4+/-0.2 g/24 h vs. 4.1+/-0.2 g/24 h). Of note, patients treated with CCB had significantly less proteinuria (P = 0.028) in the ACEi group compared to the placebo group. Patients treated with CCBs versus those who did not receive CCBs had faster delta GFR in the overall study population and in the placebo group, but not in the Ramipril group. Proteinuria was comparable in patients treated with CCBs and without CCBs for MAP < or = 100 mmHg, but was higher in patients treated with CCBs for MAP >100 mmHg. Similarly, proteinuria was comparable in the placebo group and in the ACEI group for MAP < or = 100 mmHg, but was higher in the placebo group for MAP >100 mmHg. In patients treated with CCB and placebo, a linear correlation (P = 0.006 for both groups) was found between proteinuria and MAP values. MAP, proteinuria, and delta GFR in patients receiving nifedipine versus those receiving other dihydropyridine CCBs were comparable. Therefore, in nondiabetic proteinuric nephropathies, dihydropyridine CCB may have an adverse effect on renal protein management that depends on the severity of hypertension and is minimized by ACEI therapy or tight BP control. ACE inhibitors may electively limit proteinuria in patients receiving dihydropyridine CCBs and/or with uncontrolled hypertension.",0,0

For this reason, recent attention has focused on calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. While these agents lower blood pressure, outcome data from large randomized trials are lacking, but some case-control data, dominated by short-acting dihydropyridines, suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular events. These studies had methodological limitations and did not differentiate between types and formulations of calcium antagonists. Several studies differentiating between types of calcium channel blockers and an overview of published randomized trials show no increased risk with verapamil and suggest benefit in patients with CAD.; A total of 27,000 patients with CAD and hypertension will be randomized in 1,500 primary care centers to receive an antihypertensive care strategy based on calcium antagonists (verapamil) or beta-blockers/diuretics (atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide). The study uses a novel ""paperless"" electronic system for direct on-screen data entry, randomization, and drug distribution from a mail-order pharmacy connected to the coordinating center via the Internet.; Contract negotiations with the United States and international sites are ongoing. The included patients are predominantly elderly (72% 60 years or older), male (54%), with abnormal coronary angiogram or previous MI (71%). In addition to hypertension, CAD, and advanced age, most patients (89%) have one or more associated conditions (diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, cerebral or peripheral vascular disease, etc.) that contribute to an increased risk of adverse results. While 26% have diabetes, most of them are not insulin dependent. Using the protocol strategies, target blood pressures (according to JNC VI) have been achieved in 58% at the fourth visit and, as expected, the majority (89%) are requiring multiple antihypertensive medications; The design and baseline characteristics of the initial patients recruited for a prospective, randomized, international, multicenter study comparing two therapeutic strategies to control hypertension in patients with CAD are described.",0,0

All patients responded to enalapril within 8 weeks with a significant decrease in Hb, Ht and RBC. In one patient, the downward trend was more rapid and sustained, and treatment had to be discontinued to prevent the development of anemia. Serum erythropoietin was normal in all four patients and remained unchanged during the study, even after discontinuation of enalapril treatment. Serum creatinine remained relatively stable throughout the study.

This may be related to a defect in tubular reabsorption. It is well known that converting enzyme inhibition decreases microalbuminuria and may prevent or delay diabetic nephropathy. We investigated whether enalapril also improves the defect in calcium and phosphate reabsorption. We studied 16 children and young adults (12 to 21 years of age) with IDDM and persistent microalbuminuria before and during 12 weeks of enalapril treatment. Before treatment, microalbuminuria, urinary calcium excretion, and tubular phosphate fractional reabsorption (TPR) were 153+/-53 microg/min, 5.5+/-0.9 mg/kg per day, and 71, 4+/-3.6%, respectively.

Whether ACE inhibitors have beneficial effects on NMS is unknown; Thirty subjects who had reproducible tilt-table test (HUT)-induced NMS were randomized and double-blindly divided into placebo and enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) groups. Hemodynamics and plasma catecholamine concentrations were studied. Before enalapril administration, HUT-induced syncope was associated with severe hypotension and bradycardia. Plasma catecholamine concentrations were significantly elevated during NMS compared to the supine position before tilting. Oral enalapril rather than placebo produced a marked reduction in diastolic blood pressure during the supine position before tilting. Enalapril administration prevented HUT-induced NMS and increased plasma catecholamine concentrations in all patients examined. In contrast, placebo had no effect in the majority of NMS patients (12 of 15 subjects). Follow-up data showed that NMS disappeared in 14 (93%) of 15 patients treated with enalapril; This study demonstrates that ACE inhibitors can effectively prevent NMS, presumably by inhibiting sympathetic system activation and peripheral hypotensive effect.",0,0

Sixty-six patients had a good clinical response to intensification of antianginal therapy and therefore received additional medical treatment. In 60 patients with refractory angina, single laser transmyocardial revascularization was performed without extracorporeal circulation or additional grafts. The transmyocardial laser revascularization group was 32% female; 78.3% of the patients had undergone bypass surgery; the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 53.6 +/- 15%. Eighty-five percent of transmyocardial laser revascularization patients had demonstrable ischemic regions, as visualized by dipyridamole-MIBI scintigraphy. The percentage of patients with some hibernating myocardium in positron emission tomography studies was 70%. Patients who had undergone laser treatment experienced good early relief of angina symptoms.

The risk of transmyocardial laser revascularization was significantly elevated in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <40%. Late deaths (n = 9) were due to sudden arrhythmias or pump failure.

All patients had a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% early postinfarction. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, norepinephrine, and renin activity progressively decreased over time. Patients with events had a persistent increase in these neurohormones, and those who died within the first 24 months of follow-up had the greatest increase. Captopril treatment affected only plasma renin activity (increased) and aldosterone (decreased). For patients who were asymptomatic during the first 3 months after infarction (n = 471), by multivariate analysis (all neurohormones plus non-neurohumoral risk factors), plasma atrial natriuretic peptide at 3 months and aldosterone were those most closely related to the development of severe heart failure or to the combined endpoints (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or severe heart failure). Neither neurohormone was associated with recurrent myocardial infarction or cardiovascular mortality. When the last neurohormone measured before an event was considered together with non-neurohumoral risk factors (adjusted univariate), atrial natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were associated with prognosis, indicating that a dependent analysis of time identified a closer relationship between neurohormones and events than that identified by the 3-month values. However, by multivariate analysis, atrial natriuretic peptide was the only neurohormone associated with an event, being associated with the development of severe heart failure (P < 0.001) and the combined endpoints (P = 0.022). However, when neurohormones were considered as binary variables, activated or not activated (defined as > 1.96 SD above the mean of age-matched controls), an association was observed between norepinephrine activation before infarction of recurrent myocardium (P < 0.001) and the final combined. -points (P < 0.01) and between aldosterone activation and severe heart failure (P < 0.05) was identified.; Neurohumoral activation progressively decreases after infarction, but only in patients with a good prognosis. In patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% and asymptomatic postinfarction plasma atrial natriuretic peptide at 3 months, aldosterone levels appeared to be the neurohormones most closely associated with prognosis. Elevated levels of atrial natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, and norepinephrine appear to be temporally more closely associated with events.",0,0

After 4 weeks, only responders (diastolic BP <90 mm Hg) entered a 5-month maintenance period. At baseline, and at 3 and 6 months, LVMI was blindly estimated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, for comparison, by echocardiography. Of the 50 randomized patients, three were excluded from the study for not responding after 4 weeks; furthermore, two patients taking benazepril and one taking nitrendipine discontinued treatment after 2 months due to adverse effects. Both monotherapies reduced systolic and diastolic BP to a similar degree. After 3 months, LVMI estimated by MRI decreased by 21.5 g/m2 in the benazepril group and 8.8 g/m2 in the nitrendipine group, with an adjusted mean difference between the two groups of 11.1 g /m2 (95% CI, 7.3-14.8 g). /m2; p = 0.0001).

Subjects performed cycle ergometer exercise tests at 2 to 6 months (T1), 10 to 14 months (T2), and > 22 months (T3) after myocardial infarction; Oxygen consumption (VO2), VCO2, and VE were measured throughout each exercise trial. The dependent variables were VO2 peak (VO2peak), ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT), and VE/VCO2 ratio measured at 30 W and at 75% VO2peak; VO2peak and VAT did not differ as a result of treatment (CAP vs PLC, p = 0.92 and 0.80) or over time (T1 vs T2 vs T3, p = 0.51 and 0.07). VE/VCO2 was significantly lower for CAP at 30 W (p = 0.05) and, although lower than 75% of VO2peak, it did not obtain statistical significance (p = 0.22). Differences between groups were greater at T2 and T3 compared to T1; CAP resulted in a reduced VE/VCO2 ratio during submaximal exercise. Reduced ventilation may allow patients to perform their normal activities of daily living with less perceived difficulty, reduce symptoms, and provide a better quality of life.",0,0

Bosentan was discontinued in 1 patient with symptomatic hypotension and 2 patients (bosentan group) refused hemodynamic investigations on day 14. Compared with placebo, bosentan on day 1 significantly decreased mean arterial pressure (difference from baseline over 12 hours [95% CI], -13, 9% [-16.0% to -11.7%]), mean pulmonary artery pressure (-12.9% [-17.4% to -8.3%]), and capillary wedge pressure (-14 .5% [-20.5% to -8.5%]), and right atrial pressure (-20.2% [-29.4%]% to -11.0%]).

2499,9829158,Candesartan cilexetil. A review of its use in essential hypertension.,,"McClellan, K J; Goa, K L","Candesartan cilexetil is completely converted to candesartan, a non-peptide angiotensin II receptor blocker, during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan selectively blocks and slowly dissociates from the angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1) that mediates most of the known activities of angiotensin II. When administered once daily, candesartan cilexetil 8 to 32 mg orally dose-dependently and effectively lowers blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. In comparative studies, candesartan cilexetil 8 mg/day was as effective as usual therapeutic doses of enalapril, losartan potassium, hydrochlorothiazide, and amlodipine. One study showed that candesartan cilexetil 16 mg/day was more effective than losartan potassium 50 mg/day. Furthermore, the combination of candesartan cilexetil with hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine resulted in additive antihypertensive effects. Preliminary evidence suggests that the blood pressure lowering effects of candesartan cilexetil are associated with the prevention or amelioration of target organ damage in patients with hypertension. However, this requires further confirmation in clinical studies. Candesartan cilexetil improves insulin sensitivity in patients with hypertension and does not affect glucose homeostasis or serum lipid profile in those with coexisting type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus. Candesartan cilexetil is well tolerated in patients with hypertension. Pooled data indicate that the drug's tolerability profile is not significantly different from placebo, with headache being the most frequently reported event. Adverse events are not dose related and are mostly mild to moderate in severity. Candesartan cilexetil is better tolerated than enalapril, primarily due to a reduced incidence of cough, and was not associated with the hypokalaemia or hyperuricaemia seen with hydrochlorothiazide in a study in patients aged > or = 75 years. The drug has an adverse event profile similar to that of losartan potassium in patients with mild to moderate hypertension; Candesartan cilexetil once daily is effective and well tolerated when used once daily (as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents) in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hypertension. Initially, however, the drug is likely to be used as an alternative to other agents in patients who do not respond to or tolerate their current drug therapy.",0,0
2500,9829159,Trandolapril. An update on its pharmacology and therapeutic use in cardiovascular disorders.,,"Peters, D C; Noble, S; Plosker, G L","Trandolapril is an orally administered angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that has been used in the treatment of patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF) and after myocardial infarction (MI). Trandolapril is a non-sulfhydryl prodrug that is hydrolyzed to the active diacid trandolaprilat. Trandolapril 2 mg once daily provides effective 24-hour blood pressure (BP) control in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, with a minimum/maximum ratio of BP reduction (as determined by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring). hours) consistently > or = 50%. Trandolapril has antihypertensive efficacy similar to that of enalapril, as indicated by several clinical trials. Combination therapy with sustained-release trandolapril and verapamil has a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either agent alone. Only limited data are available on the use of trandolapril in patients with CHF, although ACE inhibitors as a class are recommended as first-line therapy in such patients. In the Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study, trandolapril 1 to 4 mg once daily resulted in an early and long-term reduction in all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular mortality, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction ( VI) after an MI. Trandolapril treatment was started a mean of 4.5 days after the acute MI and continued for 24 to 50 months. At the end of the study, the relative risk of death from any cause with trandolapril versus placebo was 0.78 (p = 0.001). The tolerability profile of trandolapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Most adverse events are mild and transient in nature and include cough, asthenia, dizziness, headache, and nausea. Trandolapril has no adverse effects on lipid or carbohydrate metabolism; trandolapril has a favorable pharmacological profile and antihypertensive efficacy at least comparable to that of other ACE inhibitors. The pharmacological characteristics of trandolapril allow it to provide good BP control for 24 hours with once daily administration. Trandolapril has also shown some efficacy in a small number of CHF patients. In addition, trandolapril provides long-term protection against all-cause mortality in patients with LV dysfunction after myocardial infarction. The results of the Prevention of Events with Inhibition of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (PEACE) study will determine its potential as a cardioprotective agent in patients with coronary artery disease and preserved LV function. Therefore, trandolapril represents an effective, well-tolerated, and convenient treatment option for patients with mild to moderate hypertension or LV systolic dysfunction after myocardial infarction.",0,0

One hundred patients from 16 outpatient treatment centers in the United States were included in this double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled study, stratified by sex. After a lisinopril challenge phase and a placebo washout phase, patients were randomly assigned to receive losartan 50 mg once daily, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, or placebo for up to 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the presence or absence of dry cough during the double-blind period, as rated by the patient at each visit using a validated symptom assessment questionnaire. A secondary endpoint was the frequency of dry cough, measured at each visit using a visual analog scale (VAS). The incidence of dry cough was significantly higher in the lisinopril group than in the losartan and placebo groups (87.5% vs. 36.7% and 31.4%, respectively) at the end of the double-blind treatment period; there were no statistically significant differences between the losartan and placebo groups. Mean VAS scores showed that patients treated with lisinopril rated themselves as having a significantly higher frequency of cough than patients treated with losartan or placebo (4.0 vs. 1.2 and 1.5, respectively). Again, the difference between the losartan and placebo groups was not statistically significant. All treatments were otherwise well tolerated and no serious clinical or laboratory adverse events were reported during the double-blind phase of the study. These results demonstrate that the incidence, severity, and frequency of dry cough in patients with a history of ACE inhibitor-induced dry cough are significantly lower in those treated with losartan than in those treated with lisinopril and are similar in incidence, severity, and frequency. dry cough in those who received placebo.",0,0

For comparison, 22 age-matched healthy normotensive control subjects were included. Measurements were made at baseline and after 1 year of antihypertensive treatment. Minimum vascular resistance and compliance (stiffness) of resistance vessels in skin and skeletal muscle were measured using the local isotope washout method.3.

Skeletal muscle vascular compliance remained unchanged after 1 year of nisoldipine treatment (22+/-3.3% and 19+/-2.7%) and lisinopril (19+/-2.1% and 24+/-2.5%), but was reduced compared to a control value of 43+/-3.7 % (P<0.0001 for diabetic patients versus controls). However, neither nisoldipine nor lisinopril had with no effect on increasing minimal vascular resistance or reducing skeletal muscle compliance.5.

There was no significant effect of antihypertensive treatment on arteriolar hyalinosis.6. The reduction in systemic blood pressure was identical during 1 year of treatment with nisoldipine or lisinopril. Abnormal arteriolar stiffness was more pronounced in the nisoldipine than lisinopril group, and nisoldipine alone compared with lisinopril improved abnormal arteriolar stiffness and minimal vascular resistance in the skin. This suggests that nisoldipine may reverse peripheral skin perfusion and thus improve local protection against the development of ischemic skin lesions in patients with type I diabetes and clinical diabetic nephropathy.",0,0

This study was conducted to investigate the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, quinapril, on the circadian pattern of heart rate variability (HRV), a reliable index of sympathovagal interactions, in patients with definite ALD.; Normalized HRV frequency domain indices [high frequency power (HFP), reflecting vagal tone, low frequency power (LFP), reflecting both vagal and sympathetic modulation (predominantly), and their ratio (LFP /HFP), indicative of sympathetic vagal balance]) in 60 patients with ALD at baseline and one year after therapy with quinapril (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) in a 24-hour 2-channel electrocardiogram with a solid state Holter monitor. Normal subjects (n = 30) and patients with DM without ALD (n = 30) were used as controls. The baseline circadian variation of normalized fractional power in patients with ALD was abolished, with a pronounced dominance of LFP over HFP throughout the 24-hour period. After one year of treatment, quinapril increased HFP, decreased LFP and improved their ratio, in the morning (07:00 a.m. to 03:00 p.m.) and night (23:00 p.m. to 07:00 a.m.) time intervals. , with maximum effect in the night time interval (HFP = 20%, LFP = -8%, LFP/HFP = -31%, for all comparisons p < 0.05 vs. baseline and p < 0.001 vs. to one year of placebo); Quinapril increased HFP and decreased LFP, as well as its proportion, all indicative of a reduction in sympathetic predominance. In patients with LD, these indices were more negatively affected in time intervals (morning and night).

2510,9853182,The impact of adding beta-receptor blockers to high-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor nitrate therapy in heart failure.,,"Levine, T B; Levine, A B; Keteyian, S J; Narins, B","The natural history of heart failure is one of continuous worsening of cardiac function. Beta-receptor blocker therapy has been effective in improving the clinical status and function of the left ventricle in patients with heart failure. Similarly, high doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with nitrates partially reverse the ventricular remodeling of heart failure.; We tested the hypothesis that beta-blocker therapy added to high-dose ACE inhibitor nitrates would potentiate reversal of heart failure.; Thirteen patients, aged 52 +/- 8 years, with moderate to severe heart failure, 12 of whom were referred for transplant consideration, with a duration of heart failure of 4.8 +/- 2.2 years , were prospectively followed up for 12 months. The initial echocardiographic ejection fraction was 19 +/- 8% and the New York Heart Association presentation class was 2.9 +/- 0.7. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and nitrates were increased for 6 months to a final dose of lisinopril 53 +/- 31 mg/day and isosorbide dinitrate 217 +/- 213 mg/day. At 6 months, treatment with beta-blockers with atenolol was started and titrated to a final dose of 46 +/- 23 mg/day. Two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography and metabolic stress tests were performed at baseline, at 6 months with lisinopril nitrates alone, and at 12 months with combined ACE inhibitor, nitrate, and beta-blocker therapy.; The New York Heart Association classification improved from 2.9 +/- 0.7 to 1.8 +/- 0.8 with lisinopril nitrates (p < 0.05), and to 1.5 +/- 0, 5 with the addition of beta blockade (p = NS). At follow-up, maximal oxygen consumption increased from 17 +/- 7 ml O2/kg/min at baseline to 21 +/- 5 ml O2/kg/min at 6 months with lisinopril nitrates (p = 0.06 ) with no further changes to beta lock. Ejection fraction increased from 19 +/- 8 to 33 +/- 14% with lisinopril-nitrates at 6 months (p = 0.005) and to 36 +/- 18% with beta-blockade at 12 months (p = NS) ; High-dose nitrate and ACE inhibitor therapy significantly improved the patient's clinical status and left ventricular systolic function in heart failure. The addition of beta-receptor blockade on top of high-dose ACE inhibitors-nitrates was well tolerated, but had no major impact on symptomatic status, exercise tolerance, or left ventricular systolic function. The potential for pharmacological reversal of heart failure remodeling may be finite despite the use of adjunctive therapies. Larger randomized placebo-controlled trials of beta-receptor blockade added to high-dose ACE inhibitor therapy are needed to confirm these observations.",0,0

In a longer-term study, we evaluated the effects of 60 mg or 30 mg daily doses of vesnarinone, compared to placebo, on mortality and morbidity; We enrolled 3,833 patients who had symptoms of New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30 percent or less despite optimal treatment. The mean follow-up was 286 days; There were significantly fewer deaths in the placebo group (242 deaths or 18.9 percent) than in the vesnarinone 60 mg group (292 deaths or 22.9 percent) and longer survival (P = 0.02) . The increased mortality with vesnarinone was attributed to an increase in sudden death, presumably due to arrhythmia. Quality of life had improved significantly more in the vesnarinone 60 mg group than in the placebo group at 8 weeks (P < 0.001) and 16 weeks (P = 0.003) after randomization. Trends in mortality and quality of life measures in the vesnarinone 30 mg group were similar to those in the 60 mg group, but not significantly different from those in the placebo group. Agranulocytosis occurred in 1.2 percent of patients receiving vesnarinone 60 mg daily and 0.2 percent of those receiving vesnarinone 30 mg; Vesnarinone is associated with a dose-dependent increase in mortality among patients with severe heart failure, an increase that is likely related to an increase in deaths from arrhythmia.

These observations can be partially explained by an interaction between the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the fibrinolytic system. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of salt depletion on tissue-type plasminogen activator antigen (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity and antigen in normotensive subjects in the presence of and absence of quinapril (40 mg twice daily). ). Under low (10 mmol/d) and high (200 mmol/d) salt conditions, there was significant diurnal variation in PAI-1 antigen and activity and tPA antigen. PAI-1 antigen levels in the morning (8 am to 2 pm) were significantly higher during low salt intake compared to high salt intake conditions (ANOVA, F = 5.8, P = 0.048). PAI-1 antigen was correlated with aldosterone (r = 0.56, P < 10 (-7)) during low salt intake.

Enalapril therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the relative risk of mortality (RR = 0.819, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.98, P = 0.03). This resulted in a gain of 0.11 years (95% CI 0.00 to 0.20 years) in survival during the median follow-up of 2.8 years for this subgroup and was projected to result in a gain of 2.14 years (95% CI 0.05 to 4.21 years) over the patient's lifetime. Enalapril significantly reduced the risk of first hospitalization for heart failure by 37%. For all types of hospitalizations, there was an average reduction of 32 hospitalizations per 100 patients treated with enalapril during the trial period (95% CI: 11.8 to 52.2 hospitalizations averted per 100 patients), which was at an estimated net savings of $1,656 per patient over the trial period (95% CI: cost increase of $191 to savings of $3,502). Although the projected lifetime net savings of $1,456 were not significant (95% CI: cost increased from $9,243 to savings of $12,527), evaluation of the cost per life year saved indicated that enalapril represented a cost-effective strategy. The estimated clinical benefit of enalapril among the hypertensive subgroup in SOLVD supports the recommendation that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be considered as first-line drug therapy for hypertensive patients with left ventricular dysfunction.

We recruited 2996 men and 3454 women, aged 55 to 80 years, with placebo run-in blood pressure >150/95 mmHg or isolated systolic blood pressure >160 mmHg from nine countries. Treatment assignment to nifedipine GITS 30 mg daily or coamilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/amiloride 5 mg) once daily was performed by minimization rather than randomization to balance additional risk factors. This was followed by four optional increases in treatment: doubling the dose of the main drug, addition of atenolol 25/50 mg or enalapril 5/10 mg, and then any other hypotensive drug excluding calcium channel blockers or diuretics. Target blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg or a drop > or = 20/10 mmHg; Blood pressure at the time of randomization was 172+/-15/99+/-9 mmHg. Thirteen percent of patients had not been previously treated. The proportions of each additional risk factor were: smoking > 10/day, 29%; cholesterol > 6.43 mmol/l, 52%; family history of premature myocardial infarction or stroke, 21%; diabetes mellitus 20%; left ventricular hypertrophy, 10%; previous myocardial infarction, other presentations of coronary heart disease and peripheral vascular disease, each 6%; proteinuria, 3%. 55% of patients had one additional risk factor, while 33%, 9%, and 3% had two, three, or more additional risk factors, respectively. Blood pressure (and blood pressure drops) at the end of titration and 1 year after taper was 139+/-12/82+/-7 mmHg (33+/-15/17+/-9 ) in the 5,226 patients remaining on randomized treatment The numbers requiring the four treatment increments were, respectively, 1,591, 780, 597, and 294, meaning that almost 70% of patients on randomized treatment in INSIGHT receive only the main drug. At one year, 69% of patients had blood pressure < or = 140/90 mmHg; INSIGHT is one of the first double-blind comparisons of active antihypertensive treatments, which require high-risk patients to achieve sufficient potency. Despite this requirement, it is possible to achieve good blood pressure control in most patients without the addition of multiple additional treatments that can dilute the differences between the primary agents.",0,0
2533,9892479,Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in severe cardiotomy dysfunction: a prospective randomized study.,,"Sirivella, S; Gielchinsky, I; Parsonnet, V","The occurrence of severe cardiotomy dysfunction requiring prolonged postoperative intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and inotropic support, complicating surgery for coronary artery disease and valvular heart disease, carries significant in-hospital morbidity and mortality. This study evaluated the impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) therapy in these patients in the early postoperative period.; Over a 5-year period, 298 patients with prolonged decreased cardiac output required support (>48 to 72 hours) with IABP plus two or three inotropes. This cohort was randomized into two groups, group A (195 patients) continued on IABP and inotropes alone, and group B (103 patients) given an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. captopril 48 to 72 hours after the operation and continued with IABP and inotropes.; Tissue perfusion and hemodynamic parameters improved (p < 0.0001) in group B with early termination of IABP (mean duration of support 86 hours in group B vs. 169 hours in group A) and inotropes. Maximal improvement in tissue perfusion and hemodynamic parameters correlated with reduced serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels. Hospital mortality occurred in 31% of patients in group A and 14.5% in group B. Morbidity complications developed in 37% of patients in group A and 20% in group B. The mean length of hospital stay in group A was 27 days and 17 days. days in group B. Cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, gastrointestinal, renal, and neurological complications were common in both groups; Administration of ACE inhibitors in the early postoperative period to patients with severe postcardiotomy dysfunction resulted in improved tissue perfusion with decreases in mortality, morbidity, and length of hospital stay. These drugs, by effectively limiting the physiological effects induced by the renin angiotensin-aldosterone axis and other mechanisms, caused the recovery of the stunned myocardium. More randomized trials are needed before recommending these drugs for routine use in similar patients.",0,0

To investigate whether calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors increase vascular nitric oxide activity, we evaluated renal and systemic vascular sensitivity to nitric oxide synthase inhibition in hypertensives with and without medication; Ten essential hypertensive patients, aged 22 to 51 years, were studied 3 times: > or = 4 weeks without medication, after 3 weeks of treatment with enalapril 20 mg twice daily, and after 3 weeks with nifedipine 60 mg/day. Each time, a 24-h blood pressure recording was performed, followed by an elimination study to obtain a 3-h dose-response curve for NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) infused intravenously, respectively 0.75, 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/h).; L-NMMA dose-dependently increased mean arterial pressure by 5 +/- 2 mmHg and systemic vascular resistance by 24 +/- 5% at maximum dose, while cardiac output decreased (all P < 0.001). ). Treatment with enalapril and nifedipine lowered blood pressure, while the increase in systemic vascular resistance induced by L-NMMA was potentiated (enalapril: 45 +/- 7% and nifedipine: 46 +/- 8%; both P < 0 .01). L-NMMA also decreased renal blood flow in a dose-dependent manner by 58 +/- 8% at maximum dose (P < 0.001), but neither drug potentiated these effects; These results indicate that, in essential hypertensive patients, antihypertensive therapy with enalapril or nifedipine increases the nitric oxide dependence of systemic vascular tone, which may play a role in the hypotensive effect of these drugs. However, this phenomenon cannot be observed in the renal circulation, suggesting a different endothelium-dependent regulation of vasomotion in the hypertensive kidney.",0,0

Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) is the most important physiological inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator in plasma. An elevated level of PAI has been reported to be associated with decreased fibrinolytic capacity and is a marker of the risk of recurrent coronary thrombosis; We measured serum ACE activity and plasma PAI activity in 34 patients with recent myocardial infarction and evaluated the correlation between these two values by linear regression analysis. We also administered captopril (37.5 mg/day) to 17 of these patients and placebo to the other 17 patients at random, and compared changes in PAI and ACE activity in these two groups over a 1-month period; There was a significant correlation between serum ACE activity and plasma PAI activity at baseline in patients (r = 0.498, P < 0.01). Captopril-treated patients showed significantly (P < 0.01) reduced PAI activity and a concomitant decrease in ACE activity; These results suggest that elevated ACE activity is associated with impaired fibrinolysis and that treatment with an ACE inhibitor improves fibrinolytic function in patients with recent myocardial infarction. The results also suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a role in increasing the risk of ischemic cardiovascular events when activated, and in reducing the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction by ACE inhibition.",0,0
2536,9928746,Target organ compromise in hypertensive patients in eastern Sudan.,,"Hussain, A A; Elzubier, A G; Ahmed, M E","Hypertension has become one of the leading causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated the status of blood pressure (BP) control and the pattern of end-organ complications in 198 Sudanese patients treated at a university hospital in the city of Kassala in eastern Sudan (mean age 53 years, 76% women). Excellent BP control (BP <140/90 mm Hg) was achieved in 46% of patients. Stage 2 or stage 3 target organ involvement, particularly albuminuria and ischemic heart disease, was detected in a third of patients. These complications were found to be related to the severity and duration of hypertension, as well as the frequency of cigarette use. Factors such as poor compliance, adverse socioeconomic status, as well as obesity and smoking may explain poor BP control and thus the development of hypertensive complications. We conclude that optimal BP control is still not achieved in most hypertensives in Sudan. The reasons for this failure must be identified and corrected to avoid hypertensive target organ damage.",0,0

Both drugs similarly lowered BP without affecting glucose homeostasis. In the ramipril group, EAU decreased significantly after only 3 months of treatment, while a significant, although less, reduction in EAU was observed in the nitrendipine group only after 1 year. During the second year, the change in % UAE was not statistically different between the two treatments. Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance did not show significant changes with both drugs. The progression of renal failure as assessed by the rate of reduction in creatinine clearance over the 2 years of the study was similar in the ramipril and nitrendipine groups. In conclusion, both ramipril and nitrendipine were associated with a decrease in UAE, although this reduction was earlier and more marked with ramipril. Renal function decline did not differ significantly between the two treatments.",0,0
2538,9928753,Improved efficacy with maintained tolerability in the treatment of primary hypertension. Comparison between the combined tablet felodipine-metoprolol and enalapril monotherapy. Swedish Multicenter Group.,,"Andersson, O K","In this multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study, 120 outpatients with mild-to-moderate primary hypertension were randomised, after a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in period, to receive a combination tablet of felodipine and metoprolol 5/ 50 mg (Logimax, Mobloc, Astra) once a day or enalapril 10 mg once a day. If blood pressure (BP) remained suboptimally controlled after 4 weeks (supine diastolic BP >90 mm Hg 24 hours post-dose), the dose was doubled for an additional 4 weeks. After 8 weeks, felodipine-metoprolol reduced supine BP significantly more than enalapril (19.7/12.0 mmHg and 11.1/7.2 mmHg, respectively). Mean differences in BP change between treatments were 8.6/4.8 mm Hg in favor of felodipine-metoprolol (P = 0.001/P < 0.001). A statistically significant difference in benefit of felodipine-metoprolol in standing BP was also observed. Although the dose was increased in a greater proportion of patients in the enalapril group (61%) than in the felodipine-metoprolol group (40%), fewer enalapril-treated patients achieved adequate BP control (41% vs. 63% with felodipine-metoprolol). metoprolol, P < 0.05). Both treatments were well tolerated. Three patients treated with felodipine-metoprolol and four with enalapril discontinued treatment due to adverse events. A similar number of patients reported adverse events in each treatment group. In conclusion, a combination tablet of felodipine-metoprolol 5/50-10/100 mg once daily lowered BP more effectively than enalapril 10-20 mg once daily 24 h post-dose. The result was as expected, but a more important observation was that both treatments were tolerated to a similar degree. Obviously, a considerable reduction in BP can be well tolerated, as was the main objective of demonstrating in this study.",0,0

Treatment was initiated with a response-dependent 3-step dose titration period. All patients were started on dose step 1 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 120/0.5 mg once daily) and, if not normalized (DBP <90 mm Hg), titrated at 4-week intervals on the dose step 2 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/1 mg once daily). ) at the step 3 dose (verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 mg d) for the first 12 weeks. After 3 months of treatment, all patients who did not normalize were excluded from further participation in the study. The total duration of the treatment period was 6 months. Routine safety investigations were performed before, during, and at the end of the treatment period. Verapamil SR/trandolapril was highly effective in lowering blood pressure. At the last individual visit during active treatment (also accounting for non-responders), the mean SBP/DBP reduction was 21.9/17.1 mm Hg (95% CI: 19.8- 24.1/16.1-18.1 mm Hg), with most of this reduction occurring during the first 3 months of treatment. At 6 months, 81.9% of the included patients had normalized DBP (<90 mm Hg) and 85% were responders (normalized and/or reduced DBP by at least 10 mm Hg). Normalization and response rates appeared comparable when stratified by age subgroups (63-69, 70-79, and > or = 80 years) and were all greater than 80%. Verapamil SR/trandolapril was very well tolerated and there was no evidence of clinically relevant changes in routine laboratory safety variables or resting ECG. In conclusion, the fixed-dose combination of verapamil SR/trandolapril is an effective and safe treatment alternative for elderly hypertensive patients.",0,0

(1.5 x 10(6) U for 30 to 60 min). Trial therapy was stopped 48 hours before angiography at 3 weeks to determine regional wall motion and infarct artery flow; There were no differences in ejection fractions or end-systolic volumes between patients randomized to captopril and those randomized to placebo.

2541,9987043,The extent of regional wall motion abnormalities identifies patients at risk for extensive left ventricular remodeling: implications for post-myocardial infarction trial design.,,"Zanolla, L; Marino, P; Golia, G; Anselmi, M; Zardini, P; Borghi, C; Ambrosioni, E","The Fosinopril in Acute Myocardial Infarction Study (FAMIS) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of fosinopril in reducing left ventricular enlargement after acute anterior myocardial infarction. We evaluated the echocardiographic examinations performed during the trial to assess the trend of the remodeling process over time and to assess the role of infarct size in identifying patients at risk of progressive left ventricular dilatation; A complete echocardiographic examination was performed on admission, before discharge, and at three months. Patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery or PTCA had an additional examination before the procedure. Echocardiograms were analyzed at a central laboratory, and end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes were calculated using a modified Simpson's rule technique. Regional wall motion was assessed using the midline method, analyzing the boundary of the left ventricle along 100 chords perpendicular to the midline constructed midway between the end-diastolic and end-systolic contours. A quantitative index of infarct size was then calculated according to the number of chordae with a shortening fraction equal to or less than 5%; Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume index increased significantly over time (p < 0.0001); as a result, stroke volume increased (p < 0.0001) but ejection fraction did not change. Patients were then divided according to infarct size index at three months. For both end-diastolic and end-systolic volume, not only did larger infarcts have higher volumes, but there was also a greater increase from baseline to 3 months. Furthermore, larger infarcts had a lower ejection fraction, with a greater reduction over three months, while smaller infarcts had higher values and an increase over time. An infarct size index of 25 or greater allowed prospective identification at initial examination of patients at risk for posterior left ventricular dilatation; In conclusion, patients with the highest risk of left ventricular dilatation, that is, those with larger infarcts, constitute a group that is worth considering for any therapeutic effort to reduce the remodeling process. In fact, these patients could benefit from therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing left ventricular remodeling and should be studied in clinical trials.",0,0

Interleukin (IL)-5 regulates eosinophil count with the help of IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). IL-5 blood levels have been reported to be increased in patients with eosinophilia secondary to parasitic infections or idiopathic eosinophilia, but have never been evaluated in drug-induced eosinophilia. The aim of our study was to determine whether IL-5, IL-3 and GM-CSF are involved in eosinophilia in patients with drug-induced HSS. Plasma levels of IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF were analyzed by ELISA in seven patients with drug-induced HSS, in eight patients with cutaneous adverse drug reactions not associated with eosinophilia, and in five patients with eosinophilia not related to eosinophilia. pharmacological treatment. IL-5 levels were normal in the eight patients with drug eruptions without eosinophilia and increased in five of the seven patients with HSS. In these latter patients, IL-5 levels peaked several days before the highest eosinophil counts were observed and returned to normal within a few days, even when eosinophilia persisted. In patients with eosinophilia unrelated to drug treatment, IL-5 levels, although significantly increased, remained lower than in patients with HSS. IL-3 and GM-CSF could not be detected in any group, at any time. Our results show that IL-5 is involved in drug-related eosinophilia. As IL-5 production was only involved in the early stages of the reaction, it is suggested that IL-5 is derived primarily from activated lymphocytes rather than eosinophils. Our results support the clinical relevance of the above in vitro findings. Further studies are needed to test whether assays of IL-5 production by lymphocytes from patients stimulated by the suspect drug and/or its metabolites are useful in establishing causality in drug-induced reactions associated with eosinophilia.",0,0
