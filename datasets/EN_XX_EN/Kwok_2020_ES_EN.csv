3,"Recommendations for a standardized nomenclature of the avian coronavirus (AvCoV): result of the debates in the framework of the COST FA1207 action of the European Union: ""Towards the control of avian coronaviruses: vaccination, diagnosis and surveillance strategies""","Viruses within the Coronaviridae family show variations within their genomic sequences, especially within the main structural protein, the Spike (S) glycoprotein gene. Therefore, many antigenic forms, serotypes, or variant strains of avian coronaviruses (AvCoV) exist throughout the world. Only a few of them, the so-called protectotypes, provide cross-protection against different serotypes. New serotypes arise by recombination or spontaneous mutations. From time to time, antigenic virus variants appear that differ significantly from known serotypes. The result of this variability is inconsistent nomenclature and classification of virus strains. Furthermore, there are currently no defined standard classification methods. Within the framework of Action COST FA1207 ""Towards the control of avian coronaviruses: diagnostic, surveillance and vaccination strategies"" (""Molecular virology"" and ""Epidemiology"" working groups), we set out to define and develop a unified and standardized nomenclature internationally and classification of AvCoVs. We recommend using ""CoV Genus/AvCov/host/country/specimen id/year"" to refer to AvCoV strains.",,,2016.0,,10.1637/0005-2086-60.2.411,0

5,"Genotyping of bovine leukemia virus isolates, circulating in the stavropol territory","Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) circulating in the Stavropol Territory of Russia is characterized according to the modern classification of subspecies members. BLV proviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has been separated from the peripheral blood of animals that have been naturally infected with this virus. The subsequent amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a fragment of the env gene with a length of 444 nucleotide pairs (pn) allowed us to classify the isolates studied in genotypes 4 and 6. In addition, we have separated the BLV isolate located in addition to clusters of isolates of the eight known genotypes, which allowed it to be classified as atypical. During the sequencing of a section of the env gene of BLV provirus isolates separated in this area, the presence of 31 point mutations in the locus studied was detected, of which 11 were significant: 2 transversions and 9 transitions.",,"Abakin, S.

6,"Identification and phylogenetic analysis of sheep pox during an outbreak in sheep in Sharkia Governorate, Egypt","Sheep pox virus (SPPV) is one of the listed and notifiable diseases affecting sheep production with a significant effect on trade in new breeds of sheep. This study was conducted to identify sheep pox using cell culture, electron microscopy (EM), and the open reading frame (ORF) gene 103 during an outbreak of a landrace of sheep in Sharkia Governorate, Egypt. , in April 2017. Affected adult sheep showed pox lesions on the skin of the face, inner lips, inner thigh, and under the tail. The incidence rate of infection was 23.5% and the mortality rate in young lambs 3 to 6 months of age was 8.2%. Forty-three scabs and tissue samples were collected from clinically ill adult sheep and dead lambs and cultured on Vero cells. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed between 3 and 7 days in 40 samples. A typical Poxvirus was brick-shaped with round ends by EM negative staining and an ovoid-like structure with a bell-shaped DNA core with concave body sides by EM positive staining. By means of conventional PCR using the ORF103 gene, bands of around 570 bp referring to SPPV were obtained. The sequence amplicon was analyzed by NCBI-BLAST and registered in GeneBank under accession number MG873537 and a phylogenetic tree was designed which revealed that the SPPV isolate resembled other SPPV strains isolated in Egypt, India, China and China. Finally, both MS and PCR are considered sensitive, rapid and powerful methods to identify SPPV from tissue samples and scabs without the need for further culture, in addition to the useful and simple use of the ORF103 gene for differentiate SPPV from other Capripoxviruses. .",,"Abd-Elfatah, E.

7,Isolation and molecular characterization of new variants of infectious bronchitis virus from vaccinated chicken flocks in Egypt,"The present study aimed to determine the molecular characteristics of circulating infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains in vaccinated chicken flocks in Giza and Fayoum governorates. Thirty-four isolates were collected and egg propagation revealed their ability to induce typical IBV lesions after three to five successive passages. Three selected isolates were identified as IBV using a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene and further characterized by sequence analysis of the partial spike (S) gene. Phylogenetic analysis revealed their grouping into two groups of variants. Group I consisted of one variant (VSVRI_F3), which had 99.1% nucleotide sequence identity to the reference strain Q1. Group II consisted of the VSVRI_G4 and VSVRI_G9 variants, which showed 92.8% to 94.3% nucleotide identity with the Egyptian variants Eg/12120S/2012, Eg/12197B/2012, and Eg/1265B/2012. With respect to the deduced amino acid sequence, the three variants had a similarity of 77.1% to 85.2% with the vaccine strains currently used in Egypt. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring the prevalence of IBV variants in vaccinated broiler flocks, as well as adopting an appropriate vaccination strategy.",,"Abdel-Sabour, M.

8,"Retrotransposable elements on the W chromosome of the silkworm, Bombyx mori","The sex chromosomes of the silkworm, Bombyxmori, are named ZW(XY) for females and ZZ(XX) for males. The W chromosome of B. mori does not recombine with the Z chromosome and autosomes and genes for morphological characters have not yet been mapped to the W chromosome. Furthermore, femaleness is determined by the presence of a single W chromosome, regardless of the number of autosomes or Z chromosomes. To understand these interesting features of the W chromosome, it is necessary to analyze the W chromosome at the level of molecular biology. Initially, to isolate W chromosome-specific DNA sequences as randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, we compared genomic DNAs between males and females by PCR with arbitrary 10-mer primers. So far, we have identified 12 W-specific RAPD markers and, with the exception of one RAPD marker, all of the deduced amino acid sequences of these W-specific RAPD markers show similarity to previously reported amino acid sequences of retrotransposable elements from various organisms. After constructing a lambda phage library of B. mori genomic DNA, we obtained two lambda phage clones, one containing the W-Kabuki RAPD sequence and one containing the W-Samurai RAPD sequence, and found that these DNA sequences comprised nested structures of many retrotransposable elements. To further analyze the W chromosome, we obtained 14 W-specific bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones from three BAC libraries and subjected these clones to shotgun sequencing. The resulting sequence assembly did not produce a single contiguous sequence due to the presence of many retrotransposable elements. Therefore, we coupled PCR with shotgun sequencing. Through these analyses, we found that many retrotransposons, retroposons, DNA transposons, and their long terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR derivatives have accumulated on the W chromosome as strata. These results clearly indicate that retrotransposable elements are the main structural component of the W chromosome.",,"Abe, H.;Mita, K.;Yasukochi, Y.;Oshiki, T.;Shimada, T.",2005.0,,,0

10,Genomic and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of infectious bronchitis coronavirus,"Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) is a Gammacoronavirus that causes a highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens. A QX-like strain was analyzed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing and genetic variation throughout the viral genome at the subconsensus level was explored by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted in the order 5'-UTR-1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-EM-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3'UTR. Relative frequencies of missense:silent SNPs were calculated to obtain a comparative measure of variability in specific genes. The most variable ORFs in descending order were E, 3b, 5'UTR, N, 1a, S, 1ab, M, 4c, 5a, 6b. Protein products E and 3b play key roles in coronavirus virulence, and RNA folding demonstrated that mutations in the 5'UTR did not alter the predicted secondary structure. The SNP frequency in the Spike (S) protein ORF of 0.67% was below the genomic average of 0.76%. Only three SNPSs were identified in the S1 subunit, none of which were located in hypervariable region (HVR) 1 or HVR2. The S2 subunit was considerably more variable, containing 87% of the polymorphisms detected in the entire S protein. The S2 subunit also contained a previously unreported multi-A insertion site and a stretch of four consecutive mutated amino acids, which were mapped onto the stem region of the spike protein. Template-based protein structure modeling yielded the first theoretical model of the IBV spike monomer. Given the lack of diversity observed at the subconsensus level, the principle that HVRs in the S1 subunit are highly tolerant to amino acid changes caused by genetic drift is questioned.",,"Abolnik, C.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.033,0
11,Evolution of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5: Sequence Data Indicates Gradual Changes in Cleavage Site,"The genetic composition of a quasispecies H5 subtype hemagglutinin gene, obtained from ostrich tissues that had been infected with H5 subtype influenza virus, was analyzed using a next-generation sequencing approach. The first evidence for reiterative copying of a poly(U) stretch in the connecting peptide region at the hemagglutinin cleavage site (HACS) by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is provided. Multiple nonconsensual RNA species were detected in the infected host, corresponding to likely intermediate sequences between the putative low pathogenic precursor nucleotide sequence of influenza strain H5 and the gene sequence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. In silico analysis of the identified RNA sequences predicted that the intervening H5 sequence PQREKRGLF plays an important role in subsequent mutational events that relocate the HACS coding region from stable base-paired RNA regions to a single-stranded bulge, thus preparing the connecting peptide coding region. for RdRp slippage.",,"Abolnik, C.",2017.0,,10.1007/s00705-017-3337-x,0
12,Outbreaks of H6N2 avian influenza viruses in chickens were caused by a variety of H6N8 and H9N2 ostrich viruses.,"The first recorded outbreak of avian influenza (AI) in South African chickens (low pathogenic H6N2) occurred in Camperdown, KwaZulu/Province of Natal (KZN) in June 2002. To determine the source of the outbreak, we defined the phylogenetic relationships among several H6N2 and the previously unpublished genetic sequences of an H6N8 virus isolated in 1998 from ostriches in the Leeu Gamka region (A/Ostrich/South Africa/KK98/98). We showed that two distinct H6N2 genetic lineages (sublineages I and II) circulated in the Camperdown area, which then spread to other regions. Sublineages I and II shared a recent common ancestor H6N2, which arose from a reassortment event between two South African ostrich isolates A/Ostrich/South Africa/9508103/95 and (H9N2) A/Ostrich/South Africa/KK98/98 ( H6N8). In addition, sublineage I H6N2 viruses had several molecular genetic markers, including a 22-amino acid stem deletion in the neuraminidase (NA) protein gene, a predicted increase in N-glycosylation, and a D144 mutation of the NA protein gene. HA, all of which are associated with the adaptation of AI viruses to chickens. The H6N2 NS1 and PB1 genes shared recent common ancestors with those of contemporary HPAI Asian H5N1 viruses.

13,Phylogenetic analysis of low pathogenicity avian influenza H6N2 viruses from outbreaks in chickens (2001-2005) suggests that they are reassortments of historical ostrich low pathogenicity avian influenza H9N2 and H6N8 viruses.,"Low pathogenicity (LPAI) and high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses are periodically isolated from South African ostriches, but during 2002 the first recorded outbreak of LPAI (H6N2) occurred in South African chickens on commercial farms in the Camperdown area of KwaZulu. /Province of Natal (KZN). A sequence analysis of the eight genes and a phylogenetic analysis based on the hemagglutinin and neuraminidasc sequences were performed. Results of phylogenetic analyzes indicated that chicken H6N2 viruses likely arose from a reassortment between two South African LPAI ostrich isolates: an H9N2 virus isolated in 1995 and an H6N8 virus isolated in 1998. Two co-circulating sublineages of H6N2 viruses were detected, both sharing a recent common ancestor. One of these sublineages was restricted to the KZN province. The neuraminidase gene contained a 22-amino acid deletion in the NA stem region, which is associated with growth adaptation in chickens, while the other group, although lacking the NA stem deletion, spread to farms. business from other provinces. The persistence of particular types of H6N2 in some regions for at least 2 years supports reports from Asia and southern California suggesting that H6N2 viruses can form stable lineages in chickens. The H6N8 and H9N2 ostrich progenitors of the chicken H6N2 viruses are likely to have been introduced to ostriches by wild birds. Ostriches, in which AI infections are often subclinical, can serve as mixing vessels for LPAI strains that are occasionally transmitted to other poultry.",,"Abolnik, C.;Bisschop, S. P. R.;Gerdes, G.

14,Complete genome sequence of an African avian paramyxovirus type 4 strain isolated from a wild duck,"random amplification/deep sequencing approach was applied to determine the complete genome sequence of an avian paramyxovirus type 4 (APMV-4) strain isolated from a wild duck in South Africa in 2010. This sequence represents the fourth complete genome of APMV-4 in public sequence databases and the first for the African continent. A total of 87,402,081 Illumina double ended reads were obtained, of which 47,338,867 (54.16%) were assigned to the reference genome EU877976. The entire genomic sequence of 15,054 nt, including the intact ends, was recovered with high redundancy (coverage per base: average = 198,861.06, minimum = 52, and maximum = 1,790,889). Pairwise comparison of whole genomic nucleotide sequences indicated that APMV-4/Egyptian goose/South Africa/N1468/10 shared 97.3% sequence identity with APMV-4/KR/YJ/06, a sequence identity of 96.4% with APMV-4/mallard duck/Belgium/15129/07 and 90.8% nucleotide sequence identity with APMV-4/duck/HK/D3/75. Genomic features were consistent with previously sequenced viruses, including predicted open reading frames for the NP, P, F, and L genes, but variations were identified in the coding regions of the M and HN genes.

15,Characterization of pigeon paramyxoviruses (Newcastle disease virus) isolated in South Africa from 2001 to 2006,"Pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), a variant of Newcastle disease virus that primarily affects pigeons and pigeons, has been isolated in South Africa since the mid-1980s. Phylogenetic evidence indicates that the viruses Pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 were introduced into South Africa on multiple occasions, based on the presence of two separate lineages, 4bi and 4bii, which have been circulating in Europe and the Far East since the early 1990s. During 2006, A PPMV-1 virus was isolated from an African ground hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri) that became acutely infected with PPMV-1 and died, probably after rummaging through the carcasses of infected pigeons in the region, since a strain of PPMV- 1 closely related was also isolated from pigeons collected nearby. The hornbill isolate had ICPI and MDT values characteristic of PPMV-1 strains.

16,Characterization of a highly pathogenic influenza A virus of subtype H5N2 isolated from ostriches in South Africa in 2004,"Objectives: The H5N2 strain of HPAI that caused an outbreak in ostriches in the Eastern Cape, South Africa in 2004 was characterized. Design: Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were performed on sera from farms from ostriches in the region of the outbreak, and intravenous pathogenicity tests (IVPI), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), nucleic acid sequencing and phylogenetic comparisons were performed on HPAI H5N2 virus isolated during the outbreak. Results: The deduced amino acid sequence at the HA0 cleavage site determined by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing was PQREKRRKKRGLF and thus the virus fell within the definition of a highly pathogenic virus, but in an IVPI test in chickens on virus isolated from the case index and a value of 0.63 was recorded, which is below the criteria for highly pathogenic viruses in this in vivo test. After further passage in embryonated eggs, a second IVPI was performed and a high value of 1.19 was obtained. Cloacal swabs were taken from the initial IVPI birds, inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs, and then a third IVPI was performed on the resulting hemagglutinating infectious allantoic fluid. An index of 2.73 was recorded. Conclusions: HI tests appear to be the most sensitive tests compared to AGID when testing avian influenza antibodies in sera. An ostrich-derived virus with a virulent HA0 cleavage site was initially non-virulent in chickens, but after chicken passage, virulence increased.

18,Avian Influenza: Global Assessment of the Potential 21st Century Pandemic,"The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of Asian lineage and subsequent spread to other parts of the world and the continuing spread of the H5N1 epidemic in Eurasia and Africa to domestic birds, wild birds and humans have generated unprecedented attention in recent times and the threat of a possible pandemic through the avian-human link. Historically, from 1878 to 1955, avian plaque was described as a high-mortality disease of poultry in many countries in Europe, Asia, North and South America, and Africa, and the etiology was shown to be filterable virus. . In the 1930s to 1950s, avian plaque disappeared as an endemic disease in most parts of the world. In 1949, the first report of a low virulence disease in chickens caused by the LPAI virus was reported. In 1955, the aetiology of avian plaque was determined to be influenza A virus, which was later identified as the H7 subtype. In 1959, a ""fowl plaque-like"" outbreak in chickens was described, which was the first report of fowl plaque caused by a non-H7 AI virus, i.e. the first outbreak of fowl plaque of the H5 subtype of the AI virus. In 1961 the first wild bird infections and deaths in South African common terns were reported. In 1966 and 1971, the first LPAI H5 and H7 viruses were identified, respectively; prior to this period, only HPAI viruses had the H5 and H7 subtypes. In 1970, the AGID serological test was introduced, allowing rapid and easy identification of poultry flocks infected with the avian influenza virus. In 1972, there was the first isolation of LPAI virus from asymptomatic wild birds: ducks in the United States and shorebirds in Australia. In 1981, the term ""highly pathogenic avian influenza"" was accepted as the standard nomenclature for avian plaque and related synonyms. In 1983, LPAI virus was observed to mutate to HPAI virus during a field outbreak of LPAI and specific genomic changes were identified at the hemagglutinin proteolytic cleavage site responsible for the change in virulence. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, molecular criteria were added to the definition to classify an AI virus as HPAI. In 2002, there were the first reported infections and deaths in a wide variety of wild bird species from the AI virus H5N1, the HPAI virus. The main objective of this review is to highlight the global situation of HPAI and to provide baseline information to show the possible pandemic nature of the virus, so that prevention and control strategies can be improved.",,"Abubakar, M.

19,Phylogenetic and molecular characterization of the coronavirus that affects bovine and bird species in Cuba,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are pathogens of veterinary importance that affect birds and cattle in Cuba; however, the molecular characteristics and genetic diversity of these viruses are unknown. This study aimed to determine the molecular characteristics and genetic diversity of both agents, based on the S spike gene. Molecular analysis was performed from BCoV field strains collected between 2009 and 2011 and phylogenetic studies were performed. using partial or complete sequences of the S gene as phylogenetic markers. In addition, phylogenetic inference studies were performed on the S1 region of recent IBV isolates. All Cuban bovine coronavirus sequences were placed in a single group supported by bootstrap probability values of 100% and posterior of 1.00. Cuban BCoV sequences also clustered with US BCoV strains corresponding to GenBank accession numbers EF424621 and EF424623, suggesting a common origin for these viruses. This phylogenetic group was also the only group of sequences in which no recombination events were detected. Of the 45 amino acid changes found in the Cuban strains, four were unique. On the other hand, in the herds evaluated, two putative genotypes were found that were genetically different from the Massachusetts genotype H120 strain used in the Cuban vaccination program.

20,Viromic analysis of sewage inflow to a river basin reveals a diverse set of RNA viruses,"Virus detection in the environment relies heavily on PCR-based approaches that require reference sequences for primer design. While this strategy can accurately detect known viruses, it will not find new genotypes or emerging and invasive viral species. In this study, we investigated the use of viromics, i.e. high-throughput sequencing of the viral fraction of the biosphere, to detect human/animal pathogenic RNA viruses in the River Conwy catchment area in Wales, UK. Using a combination of filtration and nuclease treatment, we extracted the viral fraction from wastewater and estuarine river water and sediment, followed by high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis on the Illumina HiSeq platform. , for the discovery of RNA virus genomes. We found a higher richness of RNA viruses in sewage samples than in river water and sediment, and assembled a complete norovirus genotype GI.2 genome from sewage effluent, which was not simultaneously detected by conventional quantitative PCR. with reverse transcription (qRT-PCR). The simultaneous presence of various rotavirus signatures in wastewater indicated the potential for zoonotic infections in the area and suggested runoff from pig farms as a possible source of these viruses. Our results show that viromics can be an important tool in the discovery of pathogenic viruses in the environment and can be used to inform and optimize reference-based detection methods, provided that appropriate and rigorous controls are included. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Enteric viruses cause gastrointestinal illness and are commonly transmitted by the fecal-oral route. When wastewater is discharged into river systems, these viruses can contaminate the environment. Our results show that we can use viromics to find the range of potentially pathogenic viruses that are present in the environment and identify predominant genotypes. The ultimate goal is to trace the fate of these pathogenic viruses from their source to the point where they are a threat to human health, informing benchmark-based detection methods and water quality management.",,"Adriaenssens, E.

However, the detection of many new porcine parvoviruses has been increasing in recent years, but there is a paucity of information on the occurrence and prevalence of these viruses in South Africa. Molecular detection of some known parvoviruses, namely porcine parvovirus (PPV) - 1, 2, 3 and 4, porcine bocavirus-like virus (PBo-likeV) and porcine bocavirus (PBoV1/2), was carried out in 110 randomly selected archived pigs. samples collected in the years 2015 and 2016. The samples were taken from farms infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) previously examined and confirmed, with an incidence at the farm level that ranged between 5.6 and 60%. The findings showed that all parvoviruses examined were present as follows: PPV1 (29.1%), PPV2 (21.8%), PPV3 (5.5%), PPV4 (43.6%), PBo-likeV (21.8%) and PBoV1/2 (44.6%). %). The frequency of double virus infections reached 18.2% for PPV2/PPV4 and PPV4/PBoVs; while 17.3% and 7.3% of the samples analyzed showed multiple infections of the three and four viruses, respectively. Additional phylogenetic analyzes of partial sequences of PPV1, 2 and PBoV1/2 showed two major clades for each of the viruses.

22,Biological characterization and next generation genome sequencing of the unclassified cotia virus SPAn232 (Poxviridae),"Cotia virus (COTV) SPAn232 was isolated in 1961 from sentinel mice at the Cotia field station, São Paulo, Brazil. Attempts to classify COTV within a recognized genus of Poxviridae have generated conflicting findings. Studies by different investigators suggested some similarity to myxoma virus and swinepox virus, while other research characterized COTV SPAn232 as a vaccinia virus strain. Due to lack of consensus, we have performed an independent biological and molecular characterization of COTV. Virus growth curves reached maximal yields at approximately 24 to 48 h and were accompanied by virus DNA replication and a characteristic early/late pattern of viral protein synthesis. Interestingly, COTV did not induce detectable cytopathic effects in BSC-40 cells up to 4 days after infection and generated viral plaques only after 8 days. We determined the complete genomic sequence of COTV using a combination of 454 and Illumina next-generation DNA sequencing technologies. A single contiguous sequence of 185,139 bp was obtained containing 185 genes, including all 90 genes conserved in all cordopoxviruses. COTV has an interesting panel of open reading frames (ORFs) related to host defense evasion, including two novel genes encoding CC chemokine-like proteins, each present in duplicate copies. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the highest amino acid identity scores with Cervidpoxvirus, Capripoxvirus, Suipoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus, and Yatapoxvirus. However, COTV clustered as an independent branch within this clade, clearly precluding its classification as Orthopoxvirus. Therefore, our data suggest that COTV could represent a new genus of poxviruses. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Afonso, P. P.;Silva, P. M.;Schnellrath, L. C.;Jesus, D.

23,"Lumpy skin disease outbreaks in Greece during 2015 and 2016, implementation of emergency immunization and genetic differentiation between field isolates and vaccine virus strains","The aim of this study is to present epizootiological data of the contagious nodular skin disease (LSD) outbreaks in Greece during 2015-16, after the implementation of emergency vaccination and total stamping-out, together with laboratory data on the differentiation genetics among field isolates. and live attenuated strains of the vaccine virus. A descriptive geographic chronology analysis was performed to present the progressive shift of the foci to the west and, at the same time, the absence of new foci in the previously affected territorial units where high vaccination coverage was achieved. Isolation and molecular characterization of LSDV from the first recorded case in Greece (Evros/GR/15 isolate) was performed. The two live attenuated LSD vaccine viruses, currently used for emergency immunization in Greece, were sequenced and compared with the Evros/GR/15 isolate, in 3 genomic regions (GPCR gene, RPO30 gene and partial LSDV126/LSDV127 genes) . Sequence comparisons revealed important differences between the Evros/GR/15 isolate and the vaccine strains. Phylogenetic analysis resulted in the classification of the Evros/GR/15 isolate in the same clade with all field LSDV isolates, while the vaccine strains clustered in a distinct group within the LSDV clade. Additional samples from animals exhibiting skin nodules (N = 13) were characterized by sequencing at the 3 genomic regions mentioned above. Among them, in 5 animals that were vaccinated, the attenuated vaccine virus was identified. A PCR-RFLP method targeting the LSDV127 gene was developed and shown to discriminate between characterized field strains and vaccines. The findings of the present study corroborate the importance of timely and intensive vaccinations for the control of the LSDV epizootic and the genetic differences between the Evros/GR/15 isolate and the vaccine strains. This provides the basis for the development of PCR-based DIVA assays, which would be of great importance for effective disease surveillance and stamping-out during LSD vaccination campaigns.",,"Agianniotaki, E.

24,Spread of emerging new infectious laryngotracheitis viruses in Australia,"Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a major viral disease of chickens in many countries around the world. In this report, the status of ILT in Australia has been used as a model to assess the evolution of ILT viruses (ILTV). Due to its geographic isolation, Australia harbored a distinct lineage of ILT (ILTV) viruses until 2007. However, examination of ILT (ILTV) viruses involved in outbreaks between 2007 and 2009 has revealed that many of the outbreaks were caused by two new genotype viruses, class 8 and class 9. It was discovered that these two recombinant viruses arose as a result of recombination between previously existing live vaccine strains (SA2 and A20) and another live vaccine strain (Serva) introduced in the country in 2007. The new Recombinant ILTVs were also shown to possess significantly higher virulence and replication capacity compared to a previously predominant class 2 ILTV. In the current study, examination of a large number of ILTVs isolated from outbreaks between 2009 and 2015 revealed the emergence of another recombinant virus (class 10) that appears to have become a predominant genotype in New South Wales. However, in Victoria, recombinant class 9 gradually became the predominant virus, replacing class 2. Thus, there was an unusual pattern in the geographical spread of the newly emerged viruses in different states of the country. These results suggest that ILTV is rapidly evolving towards greater transmissibility and thus greater ability to spread in ILTV-free areas.",,"Agnew-Crumpton, R.;Vaz, P. K.;Devlin, J.

25,Detection and phylogenetic analysis of Orf virus in the Himalayas of Kashmir,"The Orf virus (ORFV) is a zoonotic pathogen that primarily infects sheep and goats and is responsible for significant economic losses. ORFV is endemic in all major sheep and goat farming areas of the world, including the Indian subcontinent. However, the nature of the ORFV circulating among sheep and goats in the Himalayas of Kashmir has yet to be characterized. In the present study, we describe natural outbreaks of ORFV in Himalayan sheep and goats from Kashmir. We detected the presence of ORFV in the crust lesion by PCR amplification of the major envelope protein gene (B2L). We sequenced the virus interferon resistance (VIR) gene and determined its phylogenetic relationship to that of published reference sequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on the VIR gene revealed that ORFV isolates from the Himalayan Kashmir were separated into two main groups. The sheep isolates showed genetic homology to the sheep strains reported in Greece and Italy, while the specific goat strain showed homology to the goat strains reported in China. This study demonstrates the presence of ORFV infection in sheep and goats, and reports the first phylogenetic analysis of ORFV strains prevalent in the Himalayan Kashmir.",,"Ahanger, S.

26,"The host-parasite relationships of bacteria and phages can be revealed by oligoadherence, a measure of relaxed sequence similarity.","Motivation: Recent metagenome analysis has been producing a large number of unassigned host viruses. Although the assignment of viruses to their hosts is basically important not only for virology but also for epidemic prevention, it has been a laborious and difficult task to date. The only effective method for this purpose has been to find them in the same microscopic view. Now, we tested a computational approach based on bacterial and phage genomic sequences, introducing a physicochemical parameter, SOSS (Oligo-adherence Similarity Score Set) derived from oligoadherence, a measure of the binding affinity of oligonucleotides to the DNA template. . Results: We were able to confirm the host-parasite relationships of the bacteria and their phages by SOSS analysis: all phages tested (25 species) had a markedly higher SOSS value with their host than with unrelated bacteria. Interestingly, according to SOSS values, lysogenic phages such as lambda phage (host: Escherichia coli) or SPP1 (host: Bacillus subtilis) have clearly higher similarity to their host than non-lysogenic (excretive or virulent) phages such as fd and T4. (host: E. coli) or gamma and PZA phages (host: B.subtilis). This finding is very promising for assigning unknown host viruses to their host. We also investigated the relationship in codon usage frequency or G+C content of genomes to interpret the phenomenon revealed by SOSS analysis, obtaining evidence supporting the hypothesis that higher SOSS values resulted from cohabitation in the same environment that can cause the common bias mutation. . Therefore, the lysogenic phages that remain inside the longest resemble the host. © The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press.

27,Genetic diversity and comparison of diagnostic tests for the characterization of Pakistan foot-and-mouth disease virus strains 2008-2012,"We present the laboratory analysis of 125 clinical samples from suspected cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Asian cattle and buffalo collected in Pakistan between 2008 and 2012. Of these samples, 89 were found to contain viral RNA by rRT-PCR, of which 88 also contained infectious foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) by virus isolation (VI), with a strong correlation between these tests (ÎºÂ = 0.96). Samples that were VI-positive were serotyped by antigen detection ELISA (Ag-ELISA) and VP1 sequence acquisition and analysis. Sequence data identified FMD virus serotypes A (n = 13), O (n = 36), and Asia-1 (n = 41), including three samples in which serotypes Asia-1 and O. Serotype A viruses have been classified into three different Iran-05 sublineages: HER-10, FAR-11, and ESF-10. All Asia-1 serotypes were within Group VII (Sindh-08 lineage), in a genetic clade that differs from viruses isolated before 2010. All O serotypes were classified as PanAsia-2 within two different sublineages: ANT- 10 and BAL-09. Using VP1 sequencing as the gold standard for serotyping, the overall sensitivity of Ag-ELISA for correct serotyping was 74%, and the serotype-specific sensitivity was 8% for serotype A, 88% for Asia-1 and 89% for O. The serotype-specific specificity was 100% for serotype A, 93% for Asia-1, and 94% for O. Interestingly, 12 of the 13 serotype A viruses were not detected by Ag-ELISA. This study confirms previous reports on the regional genetic diversity of FMD virus in Pakistan and highlights the importance of continued validation of diagnostic tests for rapidly evolving pathogens such as FMD virus.",,"Ahmed, Z.;Pauszek, S.

29,Whole genome analysis of porcine kobuviruses from pig feces in Japan,"Porcine kobuviruses (PoKoV) are ubiquitously distributed in pig populations worldwide and are believed to be enteric viruses in pigs. Although PoKoVs have been detected in pigs in Japan, complete genome data for Japanese PoKoVs are not available. In the present study, 24 near-complete or complete PoKoV genome sequences obtained from 10 diarrheal and 14 non-diarrheal feces of Japanese pigs were analyzed using a metagenomics approach. Japanese PoKoVs shared 85.2 to 100% identity to complete coding nucleotide (nt) sequences and the closest 85.1 to 98.3% relatedness to PoKoVs from other countries. Twenty of the 24 Japanese PoKoVs had a 90 nt deletion in the 2B coding region. Phylogenetic tree analyzes revealed that the PoKoVs were not clustered according to their geographic region of origin and that the phylogenetic trees of the L, P1, P2, and P3 genetic regions displayed different topologies from each other. Similarity plot analysis using strains from a single farm revealed partially different patterns of similarity between strains from identical farm origins, suggesting that recombination events had occurred. These results indicate that various PoKoV strains are prevalent and not geographically restricted in pig farms around the world and the coexistence of multiple strains leads to PoKoV recombination events and contributes to PoKoV genetic diversity and evolution.",,"Akagami, M.;Ito, M.;Niira, K.;Kuroda, M.;Masuda, T.;Haga, K.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Naoi, Y.;Kishimoto, M.;Sano, K.;Omatsu, T.;Aoki, H.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Oka, T.;Ichimaru, T.;Yamasato, H.;Ouchi, Y.;Shirai, J.;Katayama, K.;Mizutani, T.;Nagai, M.",2017.0,,10.1007/s11262-017-1464-9,1
30,Two new 'legumoviruses' (genus Begomovirus) naturally infect soybeans in Nigeria,"Two new 'legumoviruses' (genus Begomovirus; family Geminiviridae) naturally infecting soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) in Nigeria were molecularly characterized. Based on the characteristic symptoms of soybeans, the two viruses are provisionally designated as soybean mild mottle virus (SbMMV) and soybean chlorotic spot virus (SbCBV). SbCBV has a bipartite genome, while SbMMV has only one A-DNA component. The SbMMV A-DNA component is 2768 nucleotides (nt) in length and the SbCBV A and B DNA components are 2708 and 2647 nucleotides in length. nt, respectively. In pairwise comparisons, the A-DNA component of SbMMV and SbCBV showed 62% nt sequence identity, indicating that these two viruses are distinct. While SbMMV A-DNA contains two virion and four antisense open reading frames, that of SbCBV lacks AV2 virus sense, a characteristic gene present in ""Old World"" begomoviruses. A pairwise comparison with the corresponding nucleotide sequence of other begomoviruses in the databases indicated that SbCBV had a maximum of 74% identity with cowpea golden mosaic virus and SbMMV had a maximum of 65% identity with cowpea golden mosaic virus. Indian mung bean yellow and kudzu mosaic virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the A-DNA component of SbCBV and SbMMV along with those of other begomoviruses available in databases showed the two viruses clustering within the 'legumovirus' clade of the begomovirus phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, the A and B DNA components of SbCBV from Centrosema pubescens Benth were found to be identical to those from soybean, indicating that wild legume species are a potential alternative host for the virus.

Serological tests such as agar gel cross-precipitation test (AGPT), serum neutralization test (SNT), ELISA, indirect immunofluorescence test (IIF) and indirect immunoperoxidase test (IIP) revealed that viruses they were very related to each other. However, serotyping of these isolates using homologous and heterologous titration of their hyperimmune sera (HIS) in SNT and ELISA showed opposite results and did not allow classification of these viruses as of goat and sheep origin. Protein analysis of these isolates was carried out using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blotting, and physical staining and immunodetection of blotted protein profiles. The results revealed that these isolates differed mainly at the 41.5, 39.5 and 37.5 kD polypeptide bands.

These were compared to the sequences of 164 isolates published in GenBank, and the resulting alignment was analyzed phylogenetically using maximum likelihood. The results are presented as rootless phylogenetic trees. Briefly, the isolates were divided into six broadly distinct groups (lineages 1 to 6). Lineages 3 and 4 were subdivided into four sublineages (aad) and lineage 5 into five lineages (aae).

The authors' aim was to cover advances in Newcastle disease (ND) research over the last 40 years that they considered significant. During those 40 years there have been several panzootics of this serious disease in poultry and during the last 30 years there has been a continuous panzootic in domestic pigeons, which has spread to wild birds and poultry. The 40-year period began with worldwide outbreaks of severe ND, which served as a major impetus for ND research work. Although early work was concerned with disease control, specifically improving and developing new vaccines and vaccine regimens, even before the 1970s, Newcastle disease virus was considered a useful laboratory virus for replication studies and virulence. This review covers historical developments in the following areas: understanding the molecular basis of virulence; epidemiology and relatedness of different strains of ND, both antigenically and genetically; the appearance of virulent strains and their relationship with viruses of low virulence; sequencing and understanding of the viral genome and genes; the development of rapid molecular-based diagnostic tests; and the phylogeny and molecular taxonomy of Newcastle disease virus.

Here we investigate the involvement of AI H5N1 in outbreaks of acute respiratory disease that occurred in several commercial chicken farms in Egypt in 2011, and describe the pathology caused by the virus over the course of the outbreak. Twenty-one poultry farms with a history of acute respiratory symptoms and high mortalities were tested for AI H5N1. Virus identification was based on the hemagglutination inhibition test and PCR detection and sequencing of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. Virus distribution was determined by immunohistochemical staining of AI antigens in organs of infected birds. Standard H&E staining was performed for histological examination of affected organs. 81% of the birds tested, representing 100% of the selected farms, tested positive for the AI H5N1 virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the isolated virus reveals its affiliation to clade 2.2.1. Viral antigens were localized to endothelial cells of the heart, liver, lungs, and skin, where pathologic lesions including congestion, hemorrhage, multifocal inflammation, and necrosis were simultaneously observed. Based on the pattern of viral antigen and the distribution of lesions in visceral organs, we suggest cardiovascular and circulatory failure as the likely cause of death during these outbreaks. In conclusion, the present study further confirms the epidemic status of the AI H5N1 virus in Egypt and reveals the highly pathogenic nature of the local isolates.",,"Ali, A.;Elmowalid, G.;Abdel-Glil, M.;Sharafeldin, T.;Abdallah, F.;Mansour, S.;Nagy, A.;Ahmed, B.;Abdelmoneim, M.",2015.0,,10.1515/pjvs-2015-0101,0

Recently, two new field isolates (Car1 and Car2) of CCMV obtained from cowpeas showed distinct phenotypic symptoms when inoculated into cowpeas. CCMV-Car1 induced severe mosaic and interveinal chlorosis, while CCMV-Car2 produced mild mottling and leaf rolling. Both isolates produced asymptomatic infection in Nicotiana benthamiana. The complete genome of both isolates was amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using specific primers against CCMV sequences available in the GenBank database, cloned and sequenced. Both nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared between the newly sequenced CCMV isolates and the three previously characterized CCMV strains (T, M1, and R). Phylogenetic analysis of RNA 1 sequence showed that CCMV-Car1 was on a separate branch from the rest of the CCMV isolates, while CCMV-Car2 clustered together with CCMV-R. Based on the sequences of RNA 2 and RNA 3, two main clusters were obtained. One group included CCMV-Car1 and CCMV-Car2 isolates, while the other group contained CCMV-T, CCMV-M1, and CCMV-R strains. The recombination programs detected a possible recombination event in the RNA 1 sequence of the CCMV-Car2 isolate, but not in the RNA 2 and RNA 3 sequences.

Current methods, library screening or representation difference analysis (RDA), are very labor intensive and require selected sample sets. We have developed a simple and reproducible method for detecting viruses in individual serum samples that is based on DNase treatment of the serum followed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) of the fragments, and we have evaluated their performance in known methods. viruses Both DNA viruses and RNA viruses at a concentration of 106 genome equivalents per ml were reproducibly identified in 50 µl of serum. While the method was being evaluated, two previously unknown parvoviruses were discovered in the bovine sera used as diluent. The almost complete genome sequence of each virus was determined; its classification as two species (provisionally named bovine parvoviruses 2 and 3) was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Both viruses were found to be frequent contaminants of commercial bovine serum. DNase treatment of serum samples can be a very useful tool for virus discovery.

42,Cloning of a human parvovirus by molecular screening of respiratory tract samples,"The identification of new virus species is a key topic for the study of infectious diseases, but it is technically very difficult. We developed a system for large-scale molecular virus detection from clinical samples based on host DNA depletion, random PCR amplification, large-scale sequencing, and bioinformatics. The technology was applied to pooled samples of the human respiratory tract. The first experiments detected seven species of human viruses without the use of any specific reagent. Among the viruses detected were a coronavirus and a parvovirus, both of which were not characterized at the time. Parvovirus, tentatively named human bocavirus, was detected in a retrospective clinical study in an additional 17 patients and was associated with lower respiratory tract infections in children. The molecular virus detection method provides a general culture-independent solution to the problem of detecting unknown virus species in individual or pooled samples. We suggest that a systematic exploration of the viruses that infect humans, ""the human virome"", can be started.",,"Allander, T.;Tammi, M.

43,Estimation of viral richness from shotgun metagenomes using a frequency counting approach,"BACKGROUND: Viruses are important drivers of ecosystem functions, yet little is known about the vast majority of viruses. Viral shotgun metagenomics allows investigation of broad ecological questions in phage communities. An ecological characteristic is species richness, which is the number of different species in a community. Viruses do not have a phylogenetic marker analogous to the bacterial 16S rRNA gene with which to estimate richness, so contig spectra are used to measure the number of virus taxa in a given community. A contig spectrum is generated from a viral shotgun metagenome by assembling the random sequence reads into groups of overlapping sequences (contigs) and counting the number of sequences that cluster within each contig. Current tools available to analyze contig spectra to estimate phage richness are limited by relying on rank abundance data. RESULTS: We present statistical estimates of virus richness from contig spectra. The CatchAll program (http://www.northeastern.edu/catchall/) was used to analyze contig spectra in terms of frequency count data rather than abundance rank, allowing formal statistical analyses. Furthermore, the influence of potentially spurious low-frequency counts on richness estimates was minimized using two methods, empirical and statistical. The results show higher estimates of viral richness than previous estimates in nearly all environments tested, including pig feces and reclaimed freshwater. CONCLUSIONS: CatchAll yielded consistent estimates of richness across viral metagenomes from the same or similar environments. Furthermore, analysis of pooled viral metagenomes from different environments across mixed contig spectra resulted in higher richness estimates than those of the component metagenomes. Using CatchAll to analyze contig spectra will improve estimates of the richness of viral shotgun metagenomes, particularly from large data sets, by providing statistical measures of richness.",,"Allen, H.

44,In-feed antibiotics induce prophages in pig fecal microbiomes,"Antibiotics are a cost-effective tool for improving feed efficiency and preventing disease in farm animals, but the full extent of their side effects is not understood. Antibiotics have been shown to mediate gene transfer by inducing prophages in certain bacterial strains; therefore, a side effect could be the induction of prophages in the gut microbiome in general. Here we use metagenomics to assess the effect of two in-feed antibiotics (carbadox and ASP250 [chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine, and penicillin]) on porcine intestinal phage (virome) metagenomes. We also monitored bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. ASP250, but not carbadox, caused significant population changes in both the phage and bacterial communities. Antibiotic resistance genes, such as multidrug resistance efflux pumps, were identified in viromes, but antibiotics in food did not cause significant changes in their abundance. The abundance of genes encoding phage integrase was significantly increased in viromes from medicated pigs compared to viromes from non-medicated pigs, demonstrating prophage induction with antibiotic treatment. Phage-bacteria population dynamics were also examined. We observed a decrease in the relative abundance of Streptococcus bacteria (prey) when Streptococcus phages (predators) were abundant, supporting the ""kill the winner"" ecological model of population dynamics in the pig fecal microbiome. The data show that the dynamics of the intestinal ecosystem is influenced by phages and that the induction of prophages is a side effect of antibiotics in the feed. © 2011 Allen et al.",,"Allen, H.

47,Epidemiological study of air filtration systems for the prevention of PRRSV infection in large herds,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) is the most economically important pathogen in the US swine industry. Aerosol transmission between herds is a major concern in densely populated regions of swine and leakage has been shown of the incoming air, in combination with standard biosecurity procedures, prevents the transmission of PRRSV to susceptible herds. To quantify the impact of air filtration on reducing the risk of PRRSV outbreaks, we compared the incidence rate of new PRRSV introductions in 20 filtered and 17 unfiltered control sow herds in a swine-dense region of North America. North over a 7-year study period. New virus introduction events were determined by phylogenetic analysis of PRRSV ORF5 gene sequences. Putative new viruses were defined as exogenous (introduced) based on differences in the nucleotide sequence of ORF5 compared to previous agricultural isolates. The influence of sequence difference cut-off values ranging from 2% to 10% on case definition and relative risk was evaluated. Unfiltered farms suffered about 0.5 outbreaks per year, with a seasonal increase in risk in cooler periods. The baseline risk, before leaching, on treatment farms was approximately 0.75 per year, approximately 50% higher than on control farms. Air filtration significantly reduced the risk of PRRSV introduction events to 0.06-0.22 outbreaks per year, depending on the cut-off values used to classify an isolated virus as new to the herd. Overall, air filtration led to an approximately 80% reduction in risk of new PRRSV introduction, indicating that on large sow farms with good biosecurity in regions with high pig density, approximately four-fifths of PRRSV outbreaks can be attributed to aerosol transmission. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",,"Alonso, C.;Murtaugh, M.

48,"Characterization of H5N1 influenza, a virus that caused the first outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Saudi Arabia","Introduction: Saudi Arabia (SA) experienced an H5N1 outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in domesticated birds in 2007. Methodology: Forty-three hemagglutinin (HA) and 41 neuraminidase (NA) genes from HPAI H5N1 viruses were sequenced and Phylogenetic analyzes of fully sequenced genes were performed for comparison with other HA and NA viral gene sequences available in public databases. Results: Molecular characterization of H5N1 viruses revealed two genetically distinct clades, 2.2.2 and 2.3.1, of H5N1 viruses circulating in the area. Amino acid sequence analysis of the HA gene indicated that the 2.2.2 virus contained the SPQGERRRK-R/G sequence at the cleavage site, while the 2.3.1 virus contained the SPQRERRRK-R/G sequence. In addition, some mutations with amino acid substitutions such as M226I at the N-bond glycosylation site were identified in two of these isolates. The amino acid sequence of the NA gene showed a deletion of 20 amino acids in the NA stem region, necessary to increase the virulence of influenza viruses and their adaptation from wild birds to domestic chickens. Since close contact between humans and birds is unavoidable, a thorough understanding of virus epidemiology, factors affecting virus spread, and molecular characterization such as phylogeny and substitution rates of circulating H5N1 viruses is needed. in the region. Conclusion: Two genetically distinct clades were found to be circulating in the country, which could probably result in recombination and the appearance of more virulent viral strains.

50,Molecular characterization of the first bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) strains isolated from in vitro bovine embryo production in Argentina,"Bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) is increasingly considered responsible for various reproductive tract problems. The virus primarily infects blood mononuclear cells and shows a specific tropism for vascular endothelium, reproductive and fetal tissues. Epidemiological studies suggest its impact on reproductive performance, and its presence at various sites in the reproductive tract highlights its potential transmission in embryos at the transfer stage. This work describes the biological and genetic characterization of BoHV-4 strains isolated from an in vitro bovine embryo production system. BoHV-4 strains were isolated in 2011 and 2013 from bovine granulosa cells and oocytes from batches of ovaries collected at a local slaughterhouse, used as ""starting material"" for the in vitro production of bovine embryos. Compatible BoHV-4-CPE was observed in co-culture of granulosa cells and oocytes with MDBK cells. The identity of the isolates was confirmed by PCR assays targeting three ORFs of the viral genome. Phylogenetic analyzes of the strains suggest that they were not evolutionarily linked. Therefore, it is possible that BoHV-4 ovarian infections occurred regularly throughout the evolution of the virus, at least in Argentina, which may have implications for in vitro embryo production systems. Therefore, although BoHV-4 does not appear to be a frequent risk factor for in vitro embryo production, data is still limited. This study reveals the potential for transmission of BoHV-4 through embryo transfer. In addition, the high variability among BoHV-4 strains isolated from aborted cows in Argentina highlights the importance of further investigating the role of this virus as an agent with the potential to cause reproductive diseases in cattle. Genetic characterization of isolates provides data to better understand the pathogenesis of BoHV-4 infections. Furthermore, it will lead to fundamental insights into the molecular aspects of the virus and the means by which these strains circulate in herds.",,"Altamiranda, E. G.;Manrique, J. M.;PÃ©rez, S.

54,"A Broad Spectrum, One-Step Reverse Transcription PCR Amplification of the Neuraminidase Gene from Multiple Influenza A Virus Subtypes","BACKGROUND: The appearance of highly pathogenic strains of influenza A virus in a variety of human and animal hosts, with a wide geographic distribution, has highlighted the importance of rapid identification and subtyping of the virus for the management and treatment of outbreaks. Type A virus can be classified into subtypes based on viral envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin, and neuraminidase. Here we review the existing specificity and amplification of published primers for neuraminidase subtype genes and describe a new broad-spectrum primer pair that can detect all 9 neuraminidase subtypes. RESULTS: Bioinformatic analysis of 3,337 full-length influenza A neuraminidase segments in the NCBI database revealed semi-conserved regions not previously targeted by primers. Two M13 tagged degenerate primers, NA8F-M13 and NA10R-M13, were designed from these regions and used to generate a 253 bp cDNA product. One-step RT-PCR testing was successful in 31/32 (97%) of cases using an RNA challenge protocol from over 32 different cultured influenza A virus strains representing all 9 influenza A subtypes. neuraminidase. Frozen blinded clinical nasopharyngeal aspirates were also tested and were mostly of the N2 subtype. The amplified region was directly sequenced and then used in database searches to confirm the identity of the template RNA. The generated RT-PCR fragment includes one of the mutation sites related to oseltamivir resistance, H274Y. CONCLUSION: Our one-step RT-PCR assay followed by sequencing is a rapid, accurate, and specific method for the detection and subtyping of different neuraminidase subtypes from a variety of host species and from different geographic locations.",,"Alvarez, A.

55,High-throughput sequencing of double-stranded RNA reveals a novel cytohabdovirus in a common bean transgenic line resistant to bean golden mosaic virus,"Using high-throughput sequencing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we identified five RNA viruses in a common bean transgenic line resistant to bean golden mosaic virus (BGMV) with symptoms of viral infection. Four of the identified viruses had already been described as infecting common beans (cowpea mild mottle virus, bean rough mosaic virus, Phaseolus vulgaris alphaendornavirus 1 and Phaseolus vulgaris alphaendornavirus 2) and one is a new putative plant rhabdovirus (genus Cytorhabdovirus), tentatively named bean-associated cytorhabdovirus (BaCV). The BaCV genome featured all five open reading frames (ORFs) found in most rhabdoviruses: nucleoprotein (N) (ORF1) (451 amino acids, aa), phosphoprotein (P) (ORF2) (445 aa), matrix (M) (ORF4) ) (287 aa), glycoprotein (G) (ORF5) (520 aa), and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) (ORF6) (114 aa), as well as a putative movement protein ( P3) (ORF3) ( 189 aa) and the hypothetical small protein P4. The predicted BaCV proteins were compared with homologous proteins from the closest cytorhabdoviruses and a low level of sequence identity (15-39%) was observed. Phylogenetic analysis shows that BaCV clustered with yerba mate chlorosis-associated virus (YmCaV) and rice streak mosaic virus (RSMV). Overall, our results provide strong evidence that BaCV is indeed a new virus species in the genus Cytorhabdovirus (family Rhabdoviridae), the first rhabdovirus identified to infect common beans.",,"Alves-Freitas, D.

57,Bovine-type coronavirus in domestic and wild ruminants,"Coronaviruses (CoV) produce a wide spectrum of disease syndromes in different host species of mammals and birds. These viruses are well recognized for their ability to change tissue tropism, overcome species barriers, and adapt to ecological variations. The inherent genetic diversity of CoVs caused by the accumulation of point mutations and the high frequency of homologous recombination is predicted to be the main determinant of these competencies. Several CoVs (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV) have been reported to cross the species barrier, inducing different disease conditions in variable animal hosts. Bovine CoV (BCoV) is a leading cause of gastroenteritis and respiratory illness in calves, winter dysentery in lactating cows, and shipping fever pneumonia in feedlot cattle. Although long known as a restrictive pathogen of livestock, CoVs that are closely related to BCoV have been recognized in dogs, humans, and other ruminant species. Biological, antigenic, and genetic analyzes of so-called 'bovine-like CoVs' proposed classification of these viruses as host-range variants rather than distinct virus species. In this review, we discuss the different bovine-type CoVs that have been identified in domestic ruminants (water buffalo, sheep, goats, dromedaries, llamas, and alpacas) and wild ruminants (deer, feral cattle, antelope, giraffe, and feral goats). . in terms of epidemiology, transmission and characteristics of the virus.

58,Metagenomic analysis demonstrates fecal virome diversity in asymptomatic pigs in East Africa,"Pigs harbor a variety of viruses that are closely related to human viruses and are suspected of having zoonotic potential. Little is known about the presence of viruses on smallholder farms where pigs are in close contact with humans and wildlife. This study provides information on viral communities and the prevalence and characteristics of enteric viral coinfections in small-scale pigs in East Africa. Sequence-independent amplification and high-throughput sequencing were applied to metagenomic analysis of viruses in faeces collected from asymptomatic pigs. A total of 47,213 assembled de novo contigs were constructed and compared with sequences from the GenBank database. The Blastx search results revealed that 1039 contigs (>200 nt) were related to viral sequences in the GenBank database. Of the 1039 contigs, 612 were not assigned to any viral taxa because they had little similarity to known viral protein or genomic sequences, while 427 contigs had a high level of sequence similarity to known viruses and were assigned to viral taxa. The most frequent contigs related to mammalian viruses resemble members of the viral genera Astrovirus, Rotavirus, Bocavirus, Circovirus, and Kobuvirus. Other less abundant contigs were related to members of the genera Sapelovirus, Pasivirus, Posavirus, Teschovirus and Picobirnavirus. This is the first report on the diversity of the faecal virome of pig populations in East Africa. The findings of the present study help elucidate the etiology of diarrheal diseases in pigs and identify possible zoonotic and emerging viruses in the region.

59,Association of increased rate of broiler carcass condemnation due to liver abnormalities with immunosuppressive diseases in the Saskatchewan broiler industry,"The objective of this study was to identify the causative agents of hepatitis observed in broilers during processing. Livers were collected from chickens from 16 Saskatchewan broiler farms with gross hepatitis lesions during processing. In addition to routine bacterial isolation and histopathological examination, serological studies for infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and chicken anemia virus (CAV), calculation of the ratio of bursa weight to Fabricio (BF) and body weight (BBW), and histopathological examination of the BF were performed. Of the 264 livers with gross lesions, 83% had multifocal to coalescent necrotizing hepatitis, 16% had perihepatitis, and 1% had hemorrhages. No definitive causative organisms were isolated from the liver lesions; however, no significant bacterial isolates were made. Bursal atrophy, low BBW ratio, and high IBDV antibody titer were correlated with total conviction rate (P = 0.0188, P = 0.0001, and P = 0.0073, respectively). Nucleotide sequencing of IBDV isolated from BF identified variants of the Delaware-E and 586 strains. Conviction of liver injury correlated with IBDV and BBW antibody titer (P = 0.016 and P = 0.027). The results of this study demonstrate that liver lesions in Saskatchewan chickens are not currently caused by a primary bacterial pathogen, but rather are associated with markers of immunosuppression likely due to an IBDV variant.",,"Amini, K.;Zachar, T.;Popowich, S.;Knezacek, T.;Goodhope, B.;Willson, P.;Gomis, S.",2015.0,,,0

62,"Genetic characterization of 2008 recombinant influenza A (H5N1) virus, Thailand","In January and November 2008, outbreaks of avian influenza were reported in 4 provinces in Thailand. Eight influenza A H5N1 viruses were recovered from these 2008 AI outbreaks and were extensively characterized and analyzed for nucleotide identity, genetic relatedness, virulence determinants, and potential reassortment sites. The results show that the 2008 H5N1 viruses exhibited features of genetic drift (less than 3% genetic differences), such as those commonly found in influenza A viruses. Based on phylogenetic analysis, clade 1 viruses in Thailand were divided in 3 different branches (subclades 1, 1.1 and 1.2). Six of the 8 H5N1 isolates have been identified as H5N1 reassortant viruses, while other isolates belong to an original H5N1 clade. These viruses have reassorted between lineages between subclades 1.1 and 1.2 and therefore represent new 2008 H5N1 reassortants. The reassortant viruses have acquired gene segments from H5N1, subclade 1.1 (PA, HA, NP, and M) and subclade 1.2 (PB2, PB1, NA, and NS) in Thailand. Bootscan analysis of concatenated whole genome sequences of the 2008 H5N1 viruses supported reassortment sites between subclade 1.1 and 1.2 viruses. Based on the time estimate of the most recent common ancestors of the 2008 H5N1 viruses, the potential point of genetic rearrangement for the viruses dates back to 2006. Genetic analysis of the 2008 H5N1 viruses has shown that most of the determinants of virulence in all 8 virus genes have remained unchanged. In summary, two predominant lineages of H5N1 were circulating in 2008. The original CUK2-like lineage circulated mainly in central Thailand and the mixed lineage (subclades 1.1 and 1.2) circulated predominantly in northern Thailand. To prevent further reassortments, emphasis should be placed on prevention of H5N1 viruses circulating in high-risk areas. In addition, surveillance and whole genome sequencing of H5N1 viruses should be performed routinely to monitor genetic drift of the virus and new reassortant strains, especially in light of potential reassortment between avian and mammalian H5N1 viruses.",,"Amonsin, A.;Lapkuntod, J.;Suwannakarn, K.;Kitikoon, P.;Suradhat, S.;Tantilertcharoen, R.;Boonyapisitsopa, S.;Bunpapong, N.;Wongphatcharachai, M.;Wisedchanwet, T.;Theamboonlers, A.;Poovorawan, Y.;Sasipreeyajan, J.;Thanawongnuwech, R.",2010.0,2016-09-01 00:00:00,,0

We analyzed viral nucleotide sequences from mosquitoes collected in 2005, 2006, and 2007 from a known transmission ""hot spot"" in suburban Chicago, USA. Within this approximately 11 × 14 km area, the viral envelope gene there has been an increase of approximately 0.1% yr-1 in genetic diversity at the nucleotide level. In each year, viral diversity was higher at 'residential' sites characterized by dense housing than at sites of more open 'urban green space' such as cemeteries and parks. Phylodynamic analyzes showed an increase in incidence around 2005, consistent with a higher-than-average peak in mosquito and human infection rates that year. Time-to-most recent common ancestor analyzes suggest that WNV in 2005 and 2006 may have arisen predominantly from viruses present during 2004 and 2005, respectively, but that WNV in 2007 had an older common ancestor, perhaps indicating a predominantly mixed or exogenous origin.

66,Analysis of the complete genome of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus identified limited genomic constellations and preferential rearrangement,"Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) is a Culicoides-borne orbivirus that causes hemorrhagic disease in wild and domestic ruminants. A collection of 44 EHDV isolates between 2008 and 2012 was fully sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. Serotype 2 viruses were the dominant serotype every year, except in 2012, when serotype 6 viruses accounted for 63% of isolates. The high genetic similarity (>94% identity) between the VP1, VP3, VP4, VP6, NS1, NS2, and NS3 segments of virus serotypes 1 and 2 precluded the identification of reassortment events for these segments. Additionally, there was little genetic diversity (>96% identity) within serotypes for VP2, VP5, and VP7. A preferential rearrangement within the homologous serotype was observed for the VP2, VP5, and VP7 segments for type 1 and type 2 viruses. In contrast, type 6 viruses were all VP2- and VP5-containing rearrangements derived from an exotic type 6 with the remaining segments more similar to type 2 viruses. These results suggest that rearrangement between type 1 and type 2 viruses requires conservation of the constellation of VP2, VP5, and VP7 segments, whereas type 6 viruses require only VP2 and VP5 and are restricted to the type 2 VP7 lineage. As VP2 and VP5 type 6 segments were identified exclusively in VP7-derived type 2 viruses, these results suggest functional complementation between VP7 type 2 and type 6 proteins. © 2014 SGM.",,"Anbalagan, S.;Cooper, E.;Klumper, P.;Simonson, R.

67,Dietary energy drives the dynamic response of bovine rumen viral communities,"BACKGROUND: Rumen microbes play a more important role in host energy acquisition than gut-associated microbes in monogastric animals. Although advances facilitated by the genome are providing access to the great diversity of non-cultured microbes, our understanding of the variables that shape rumen microbial communities is in its infancy. Viruses have been shown to affect microbial populations through a myriad of processes, including cell lysis and reprogramming of host metabolism. However, little is known about the processes that shape the distribution of rumen viruses or how viruses may modulate microbial-driven processes in the rumen. To this end, we investigated how the structure and function of the rumen bacterial and viral community responded in five steers fed four randomized dietary treatments in a crossover design. RESULTS: Total digestible nutrients (TDN), a measure of dietary energy, best explained the variation in bacterial and viral communities. Additional ecological drivers of viral communities included dietary zinc content and microbial functional diversity. Using partial least squares regression, we demonstrate significant associations between the abundances of 267 viral populations and the variables driving variation in rumen viral communities. Although rumen viruses were dynamic, 14 nearly ubiquitous viral populations were identified, suggesting the presence of a central rumen virome composed largely of novel viruses. In addition, virus-encoded helper metabolic gene (AMG) analysis indicates that rumen viruses have glycosidic hydrolases to potentially increase the breakdown of complex carbohydrates to increase energy production. Other identified AMGs have a role in carbon redirection to the pentose phosphate pathway and a carbon moiety for folate to drive viral replication. CONCLUSIONS: We show that rumen bacteria and viruses have different responses and ecological drivers to dietary disturbance. Our results show that rumen viruses have implications for understanding the structuring of the previously identified core rumen microbiota and the impact on microbial metabolism across a wide range of AMG. AMGs in the rumen appear to have consequences for microbial metabolism that are largely consistent with the current paradigm established in marine systems. This study provides a basis for future hypotheses about the dynamics of virus-mediated processes in the rumen.",,"Anderson, C. L.;Sullivan, M. B.;Fernando, S. C.",2017.0,,10.1186/s40168-017-0374-3,0
68,Characterization of co-circulating swine influenza A viruses in North America and identification of a new H1 genetic clade with antigenic significance,"Multiple genetically and antigenically distinct hemagglutinin genes from influenza A virus (IAV) H1 and H3 subtypes co-circulate in North American pigs. This diversity has evolved by repeated transmission of IAV from humans to pigs and subsequent antigenic drift in pigs. To understand the evolutionary dynamics of these diverse HA lineages in North American pigs, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the 1576 H1 and 607 H3 HA gene segments, as well as the 834 N1 and 1293 N2 NA gene segments. , and the 2126 M gene. These data revealed annual co-circulation of H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 viruses, with three HA clades accounting for the majority of HA sequences: of H1 viruses, 42% were classified as H1Î´1 and 40.6% were classified as H1Î³ and 53% of the H3 viruses were classified as cluster IV-A H3N2. We detected a genetically distinct minor clade consisting of 37 H1 viruses isolated between 2003 and 2013, which we classify as H1γ-2. We estimate that this clade circulated in pigs since about 1995, but was not detected in pigs until 2003. Although this clade only represents 1.07% of the porcine H1 sequences reported in the last 10 years, hemagglutination inhibition assays ( HI) showed that representatives of this virus clade are antigenically distinct and, when measured using antigenic mapping, there were up to 7 antigenic units from other H1Î³ viruses. Therefore, vaccines against contemporary H1Î³ viruses are unlikely to provide cross-protection against Î³-2 viruses. The long-term circulation of these γ-2 viruses suggests that minor virus populations may be underreported in the national dataset due to long branch lengths and gaps in detections. The identification of these γ-2 viruses demonstrates the need for robust surveillance to capture the full diversity of IAVs in pigs in the US and the importance of antigenic drift in the diversification and emergence of new antigenic variants in pigs, which complicating vaccine design.",,"Anderson, T.

69,A global phylogeny-based nomenclature system and automated annotation tool for the hemagglutinin H1 genes of swine influenza A viruses,"The H1 subtype of influenza A viruses (IAV) has been circulating in pigs since the 1918 human influenza pandemic. Over time, and with the help of other introductions from non-porcine hosts, porcine H1 viruses have diversified in three genetic lineages. Due to limited global data, these H1 lineages were named based on colloquial context, leading to a proliferation of inconsistent regional naming conventions. In this study, we propose rigorous phylogenetic criteria to establish a globally consistent nomenclature of porcine H1 virus hemagglutinin (HA) evolution. These criteria applied to a dataset of 7,070 H1 HA sequences resulted in 28 distinct clades as the basis for nomenclature. We developed and implemented a web-accessible annotation tool that can map these biologically informative categories to new sequence data. The annotation tool assigned the combined data set of 7,070 H1 sequences to the correct clade more than 99% of the time. Our analyzes indicated that 87% of porcine H1 viruses from 2010 to the present had HAs belonging to 7 contemporary co-circulating clades. Our web-accessible nomenclature and classification tool provides an accurate method for researchers, diagnosticians, and health officials to assign clade designations to HA sequences. The tool can be easily updated to track the evolution of the nomenclature as new clades emerge, ensuring continued relevance. A common global nomenclature facilitates comparisons of IAVs infecting humans and pigs, within and between regions, and can provide information on the diversity of the H1 swine influenza virus and its impact on the selection of vaccine strains, diagnostic reagents, and vaccines. performance of the tests, which simplifies the communication of such data. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> A fundamental goal in the biological sciences is the definition of groups of organisms based on evolutionary history and the naming of those groups. For influenza A viruses (IAV) in pigs, understanding the hemagglutinin (HA) genetic lineage of a circulating strain aids in vaccine antigen selection and allows inferences about vaccine efficacy. Previous reports of H1 virus HA in pigs were based on colloquial names, often with incriminating and stigmatizing geographic toponyms, making comparisons between studies difficult. To overcome this, we developed an adaptable nomenclature using measurable criteria for the historical and contemporary evolutionary patterns of global H1 porcine IAVs. We also developed a web-accessible tool that classifies viruses according to this nomenclature. This classification system will aid agricultural production and pandemic preparedness through the identification of important changes in porcine IAVs and provides terminology that allows discussion of porcine IAVs in a common context between animal health initiatives and human.",,"Anderson, T.

70,Genetic classification of 'Norwalk-like viruses',"Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction has been used worldwide for the diagnosis of Norwalk-like virus (NLV) infection, but a commonly accepted genetic classification scheme has not been established. Amino acid sequences of four regions of open reading frame 2 (ORF2) were used to analyze 101 NLV strains, including 2 bovine strains. Based on this analysis, a genetic classification scheme is proposed that differentiates 99 human strains into 2 main genetic groups consisting of 5 and 10 genetic groups, respectively. The 2 bovine strains constitute a newly defined third main genetic group composed of 2 putative groups represented by each strain. This classification scheme is well supported by analysis of the complete ORF2 sequences of 38 strains selected to represent the genetic diversity of previously used human strains. This scheme should provide a firm scientific basis for the unified classification of NLV strains detected throughout the world.",,"Ando, T.;Noel, J. S.;Fankhauser, R. L.",2000.0,,10.1086/315589,0

73,"Emerging coxsackievirus A6 causing hand, foot, and mouth disease, Vietnam","Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a major public health problem in Asia and has global pandemic potential. Coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) was detected in 514/2230 (23%) of HFMD patients admitted to 3 major hospitals in South Vietnam during 2011-2015. Of these patients, 93 (18%) had severe HFMD. Phylogenetic analysis of 98 genomic sequences revealed that they belonged to group A and had been circulating in Vietnam for 2 years before their appearance. Movement of CV-A6 between localities within Vietnam occurred frequently, whereas viral movement across international borders seemed rare. Horizon plots identified fluctuations in the relative genetic diversity of CV-A6 corresponding to large outbreaks of CV-A6-associated HFMD around the world. These data show that CV-A6 is an emerging pathogen and emphasize the need for active surveillance and understanding of the mechanisms that shape the evolution and emergence of the pathogen, which is essential for the development and implementation of intervention strategies. .",,"Anh, N.

74,Origin of the 1918 Pandemic Influenza A H1N1 Virus as Studied by Codon Usage Patterns and Phylogenetic Analysis,"The 1918 pandemic was caused by an influenza A H1N1 virus, which is a negative-strand RNA virus; however, little is known about the nature of its direct ancestral strains. Here we apply extensive genetic and phylogenetic analysis of a wide range of influenza virus genes, in particular the PB1 gene, to gain insights into the phylogenetic relationship of the 1918 H1N1 virus. We compare the RNA genome of the 1918 strain with many other influenza strains of different origin by various means, including relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), effective number of codons (ENC), and phylogenetic relatedness. We found that the PB1 gene of the 1918 pandemic virus had ENC values similar to classical human and porcine H1N1 viruses, but different ENC values from avian and human H2N2 and H3N2 viruses. Furthermore, according to the RSCU of the PB1 gene, the 1918 virus clustered with all human isolates and ""classical"" swine H1N1 viruses. a swine H1N1 virus, which in turn might derive from an avian H1N1 precursor, which split from most other avian viruses entirely long ago.

75,Characterization of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 virus from Egyptian domestic waterfowl in 2017,"In 2016, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 virus was detected in wild birds for the first time in Egypt. In the present study, we identified clade 2.3.4.4 HPAI H5N8 virus from domestic waterfowl in Egypt, suggesting its transmission to domestic birds from migratory birds. Based on the partial sequence of the hemagglutinin gene, this virus is closely related genetically to viruses of the H5N8 subtype that circulate in Asia and Europe. Pathologically, H5N8 virus in hybrid duck induced nervous signs accompanied by encephalomalacia, hemorrhages, nonsuppurative encephalitis, and nonsuppurative vasculitis. The cerebellar granular layer showed multifocal areas of hydropic degeneration and Purkinje cell neurons were necrotic or missing. In addition, the lung, kidney, and spleen were congested, and necrotizing pancreatitis was also observed. Co-circulation of HPAI subtypes H5N1 and H5N8 with low pathogenic avian influenza subtype H9N2 complicates control of avian influenza in Egypt with the potential for new reassortant viruses to emerge. Therefore, continuous monitoring with the implementation of strict control measures is required. Research Highlights: HPAI H5N8 virus from clade 2.3.4.4 was detected in domestic ducks and geese in Egypt in 2017. Phylogenetically, the virus was closely related to HPAI H5N8 viruses identified in Asia and Europe Non-suppurative encephalitis was observed extensively in ducks infected with the HPAI H5N8 virus.

76,Two new species of bocaparvovirus identified in wild Himalayan marmots,"Bocaparvovirus (BOV) is a genetically diverse group of DNA viruses and a possible cause of respiratory, enteric, and neurological diseases in humans and animals. Here, two highly divergent BOVs (tentatively named Himalayan marmot BOV, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2) were identified in the livers and feces of wild Himalayan marmots in China, by viral metagenomic analysis. Five of 300 liver samples from Himalayan marmots were positive for HMBOV1 and five of 99 faecal samples from these animals were positive for HMBOV2. Their nearly complete genomic sequences are 4672 and 4887 nucleotides long, respectively, with a standard genomic organization and containing protein coding motifs typical of BOVs. Based on their NS1, NP1, and VP1, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 are most closely related to porcine BOV SX/1-2 (approximately 77.0%/50.0%, 50.0%/53.0%, and 79.0%/ 54.0% amino acid identity, respectively). ). Phylogenetic analysis of these three proteins showed that HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 formed two distinctly independent branches in BOV. According to these results, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 are two different new species of the genus Bocaparvovirus. Their identification expands our knowledge of the genetic diversity and evolution of BOVs.

77,Several new astroviruses identified in wild Himalayan marmots,"With advances in viral surveillance and next-generation sequencing, highly diverse new astroviruses (AstVs) and different animal hosts have been discovered in recent years. However, the existence of AstV in woodchucks had not yet been demonstrated. Here, we identified two highly divergent strains of AstV (provisionally named Qinghai Himalayanmarmot AstVs, HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2), by viral metagenomic analysis in liver tissues isolated from wild Marmota himalayana in China. Overall, 12 of 99 (12.1%) fecal samples of M. himalayana tested positive for the presence of genetically diverse AstVs, whereas only HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 were identified in 300 liver samples. The complete genomic sequences of HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 were 6681 and 6610 nt in length, respectively, with the typical AstV genomic organization. Analysis of the complete ORF 2 sequence showed that these new AstVs are most closely related to the rabbit AstV, mamastrovirus 23 (with 31.0 and 48.0% shared amino acid identity, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 indicated that HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 form two distinct groups among the mamastroviruses and may share a common ancestor with the rabbit-specific mamastrovirus 23. These results suggest that HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 are two new species of the genus Mamastrovirus in Astroviridae.

80,Phylodynamics of H5N1 avian influenza clade 2.2.1 viruses in Egypt,"Background: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5N1 subtype are widely distributed in poultry populations in Egypt and have caused multiple human infections. Linking epidemiological and sequence data is important to understand the transmission, persistence and evolution of the virus. This work describes the phylogenetic dynamics of H5N1 based on molecular characterization of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from isolates collected from February 2006 to May 2014. Methods: Complete HA sequences of 368 H5N1 viruses were generated and genetically analyzed for study their genetic characteristics. evolution. They were collected from different poultry species, production sectors and geographical locations in Egypt. The Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) method was applied to estimate the evolutionary rates between different groups of viruses; additionally, an analysis of selection pressures on the HA gene was performed using the Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting (SLAC) method. Results: Phylogenetic analysis of the H5 gene from 2006-14 indicated the presence of an introduction of viruses from the classical clade (2.2.1) from which two main subgroups originated, the variant subgroup which subdivided into 2 subdivisions (2.2. 1.1 and 2.2.1.1a) and the endemic subgroup (2.2.1.2). Clade 2.2.1.2 showed a high rate of evolution over a 6-year period (6.9 × 10-3 sub/site/year) compared to the variant group 2.2.1.1a (7.2 × 10-3 during a period of 4 years). Those two groups are under positive selection as they possess 5 distinct positively selected sites on the HA gene. Mutations at the 120, 154, and 162 HA antigenic sites and the other two mutations (129Î”, I151T) that occurred between 2009 and 2014 were found to be stable in clade 2.2.1.2. Furthermore, 13 groups of H5N1 HPAI viruses were identified based on their amino acid sequences at the cleavage site and ""EKRRKKR"" became the dominant pattern as of 2013. Conclusions: Continuous evolution of H5N1 HPAI viruses has been observed in Egypt in all poultry farms and production systems in almost all regions of the country. The widespread circulation of clade 2.2.1.2 carrying triple mutations (120, 129Î”, I151T) associated with increased binding affinity to human receptors is an alarming finding of public health importance.",,"Arafa, A.;El-Masry, I.;Kholosy, S.;Hassan, M.

Here we describe the complete genetic characterization of an avian influenza A (Qa/Egypt/11 ; H9N2) virus of subtype H9N2 that was previously isolated from a clinically normal quail flock in Giza, Egypt, in May 2011. the nucleotide sequence of the hemagglutinin gene of the Egyptian virus isolate showed the highest similarity to a group of recent Israeli strains (97%) circulating between 2006 and 2010. Sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the isolate Qa/Egypt/ 11 belonged to the A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/1997-like lineage with new mutations identified in all viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of the eight genes indicated the placement of the Egyptian virus within the same lineage of the H9N2 viruses that have circulated in the region since 2006, especially with a group of recent Israeli strains. However, phylogenetic analysis of internal genes such as the PB2, NP, and PA genes identified potential rearrangement events for these genes with unique Israeli strains.

84,Migratory birds in southern Brazil are a source of multiple avian influenza virus subtypes,"BACKGROUND: There is insufficient knowledge about the relationship of the avian influenza virus (AIV) with migratory birds in South America. Consequently, we studied samples obtained over a 4-year period (2009-2012) from wild birds at an important wintering site in southern Brazil. METHODS: We obtained 1212 oropharyngeal/cloacal samples from wild birds in Lagoa do Peixe National Park and tested them for influenza A virus by RT-PCR amplification of the array gene. Virus isolates were subjected to genomic sequencing and antigenic characterization. RESULTS: Forty-eight samples of 1,212 (3.96%) contained detectable influenza virus RNA. Partial viral sequences were obtained from 12 of these samples, showing the presence of H2N2 (1), H6Nx (1), H6N1 (8), H9N2 (1), and H12N5 (1) viruses. Since H6 viruses predominated, we generated complete genomes of all 9 H6 viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that they were most similar to viruses of the South American lineage. The H6N1 viruses did not cause signs of disease in infected ferrets and, despite genetic differences, were antigenically similar to North American isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Lagoa do Peixe National Park is a source of multiple AIV subtypes, with influenza virus levels in birds being highest at the end of their wintering period in this region.

As seen in previous seasons, the pandemic A/H1N1 09 virus was detected in severe cases during the 2011-2012 winter season and eventually became the most prevalent influenza virus during the 2013-2014 winter season. Molecular and phylogenetic analyzes of the entire viral genome are necessary to determine the antigenic and pathogenic characteristics of influenza viruses that cause severe disease outcomes. In this work we analyze the evolution, antigenic and genetic drift of Mexican isolates from 2009, at the beginning of the pandemic, until 2014. We found a clear variation of the virus in Mexico from the 2011-2014 season due to different markers and according to previous reports.

88,"Cocirculation dynamics and persistence of newly introduced clades from the 2012 outbreak associated with West Nile Virus in Texas, 2012-2015","The second largest outbreak of West Nile encephalitis and West Nile fever ever recorded occurred in the United States (USA) in the summer of 2012. The outbreak was related to the widespread circulation of closely related clades or groups of the virus West Nile (WNV) in multiple states where they were not previously found. Whether the 2012 invasive strains were able to circulate and overwinter in states with their own endemic WNV population is unknown, and the effect of viral genetics on adaptation and persistence in a new ecological niche is unclear. In this study, we sequenced 70 mosquito isolates from various Texas counties between 2012 and 2015. We identified representative isolates of the 2012 WNV groups described above (Groups 8-10) and discovered a new group that we call Group 11. Although we identified isolates representative of endemic WNV (2/70) from Texas, most isolates (68/70) were related to the 2012 invasive strains, and of these, Group 10 (45/68) was predominant. We also observed differences between the 2012 WNV groups in correlation with their genotype. Texas group 10 WNV, which carries two putative positively selected variants, had limited introductions in Texas, wide circulation, and strong evidence of continued persistence, perhaps indicative of hibernation. In contrast, Groups 8 and 11, with no positively selected variants, had multiple introductions into Texas, limited circulation, and limited persistence. Lastly, we identified a possible source of transmission in New York for Group 8 WNV entering Texas. Taken together, our study suggests that mutations in the WNV genome may influence the range and dynamics of WNV circulation and the ability of different strains to persist in new ecological niches.",,"Aroh, C.;Liang, C.;Raj, P.;Wakeland, B.;Yan, N.;Wakeland, E.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2018.08.025,0

91,Identification of a divergent lineage porcine pestivirus in suckling piglets with congenital tremors and disease reproduction after experimental inoculation,"Congenital tremors are a sporadic disease of newborn pigs characterized by action-related repetitive myoclonus. Most outbreaks of congenital tremor have been attributed to an unidentified virus. The objectives of this project were 1) to detect potential pathogens in samples from piglets with congenital tremors and 2) to develop an infection model to reproduce the disease. Using next-generation sequencing, a divergent lineage pestivirus was detected in piglets with congenital tremors. Originally, the virus was most closely related to a bat pestivirus, but is now more closely related to a recently published new swine pestivirus, tentatively named atypical swine pestivirus. A quantitative real-time PCR detected the virus in samples from newborn piglets with congenital tremors from two different farms, but not in samples from unaffected piglets from the same farm. To meet the second objective, pregnant sows were inoculated with serum containing the pestivirus or PBS (control) intravenously and intranasally simultaneously with direct inoculation of fetal amniotic vesicles by ultrasound-guided surgical technique. The inoculations were made at 45 or 62 days of gestation. All sows inoculated with the new pestivirus farrowed affected piglets with congenital tremors, while control piglets inoculated with PBS were unaffected. Tremor severity for each piglet was scored from videos taken 0, 1, and 2 days after farrowing. Tremor severity remained relatively constant from 0 to 2 days postpartum for most piglets. The prevalence of congenital tremors in pestivirus-inoculated litters ranged from 57% (4 of 7 affected piglets) to 100% (10 of 10 affected piglets). The virus was consistently detected by PCR in tissues from piglets with congenital tremors, but was not detected in control piglets. PCR-positive samples in more than 90% of piglets sampled included brain stem (37 of 41), mesenteric lymph node (37 of 41), tracheobronchial lymph node (37 of 41), and whole blood (19 of 20). Although the first description of congenital tremors was in 1922, this is the first reported reproduction of congenital tremors after experimental inoculation with a porcine pestivirus of divergent lineage. Studies investigating disease mechanism, epidemiology, and diagnostic assay development are needed to better understand the pathophysiology of congenital tremors due to this pestivirus.",,"Arruda, B.

92,Genetic ancestry of foreign antigens of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus,"The objective of the present investigation was to discover the genetic relationships of the external antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of the 2009 novel pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus (NIV) with other influenza viruses by performing phylogenetic analyses. , comparative and statistical. Phylogenetic trees for these two antigens show that the sequences of the NIV viruses are relatively homogeneous and were derived from various viruses circulating in pigs. The HA phylogenetic tree shows that NIV was most closely related to North American pig lineages, while NA was most closely related to European pig lineages. In both segments, the NIVs had the closest genetic relationship to the swine influenza virus lineages. It strongly suggests that pigs are the most likely animal reservoir. Comparative analysis shows that among clade A, NIVs had very low genetic divergence as well as high similarity and also underwent strong purifying selection, while neighboring clade B shows moderate values compared to those of CF clades. It indicates that the classical swine influenza viruses present in clade B could be an ancestor of the foreign antigens of NIV. The rearrangement process occurred in classical swine influenza viruses. The exclusively fixed mutation sites in pig and human NIV together with the vaccine strain provide an important suggestion for disease diagnosis and vaccine research.",,"Arunachalam, R.;Paulkumar, K.;Annadurai, G.",2012.0,,10.1007/s12539-012-0136-7,0
93,Phylogenetic analysis of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus,"The principle of the present study was to determine the evolution of the 2009 novel pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus (NIV) through phylogenetic, comparative, and statistical analyses. Phylogenetic trees of eight genome segments illustrate that, so far, the sequences of NIVs (bud group A) are relatively homogeneous and are derived from the multiple genetic rearrangement event of porcine, avian, and human viruses from Eurasia and North America. (B Group) . It implies that some of the influenza viruses in group B had a greater potential to evolve and achieve the ability to transmit from human to human after interspecies transmission from animal to human. The second analysis shows that NIV had attempted a small evolutionary change among humans and before its introduction in humans it had a long evolutionary history. Statistical analysis shows that the viruses from both the outbreak and the closest group have homologous genes in their genomes that could reflect the phylogenetic relationship of the strains, and also the presence of unique mutations between the AB groups can be associated with a higher virulence of the AB groups. NIV. Both phylogenetic and cluster analyzes confirm that gene sharing occurs between viruses originating from different species and could lead to NIV with unpredictable pandemic potential. Therefore, we conclude that an extensive study needs to be conducted to recognize which rearrangement groups are closely related to VNIs and determine the sites on VNI genes under greater or lesser selection pressure, which will ultimately be important in effective vaccine and drug design for 'swine flu'.",,"Arunachalam, R.;Paulkumar, K.;Annadurai, G.",2012.0,Feb,,0
94,Determination of rotavirus subgroups of group a recovered from piglets in Nigeria,"Subgroup analysis using subgroup-specific monoclonal ELISA revealed a preponderance of group A porcine rotavirus subgroup 2-specific antigens over subgroup 1. Of 113 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-positive test samples obtained from 4 states in Nigeria, 31 (27.4%) and 45 (39.8%) were determined to have subgroup specificities 1 and 2, respectively. However, 37 (32.7%) test specimens could not be classified into any of the known group A rotavirus subgroups. These 'unclassifiable' samples probably did not have subgroup 1 or 2 specificities in ELISA or could belong to a third unknown subgroup or not investigated in this study. In all age groups investigated, the specific antigens of subgroups 1 and 2 prevailed. This was also observed after the annual analysis of the specificity of the subgroups; however, a higher prevalence of subgroup 2 specificity was observed in 1990 and 1991. Subgroup 1 rotaviruses were found in all 4 sampled states (Plateau, Benue, Oyo, and Cross River), while subgroup 2 rotaviruses were detected only in Plateau state. All rotaviruses recovered in this study had genome-wide electrophoretic migration patterns, regardless of subgroup. Therefore, the genomic diversity of group A rotaviruses does not necessarily reflect antigenic diversity, since there is no obligatory correlation between the electropherotype pattern of the genome and subgroup specificity.",,"Atii, D.

97,Effects of orally administered Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on welfare and Salmonella colonization of young chicks,"Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a bacterium that attacks and kills Gram-negative bacteria, including the zoonotic pathogens Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Bdellovibrio has potential as a biocontrol agent, but no live animal test reports have been published, and no data is available on whether Bdellovibrio could spread between animals. In this study, we attempted to fill this knowledge gap by dosing B. bacteriovorus HD100 in poultry with a normal gut microbiota or pre-dosing with a colonizing Salmonella strain. In both cases, Bdellovibrio was administered orally together with antacids. After administering Bdellovibrio to Salmonella-uninfected birds, we measured the health and welfare of the birds and any changes in their gut pathology and cultivable microbiota, and found that although a dose of Bdellovibrio at 2 days of age altered the overall diversity of natural gut microbiota in 28-day-old birds, there were no adverse effects on their growth and welfare. Drinking water and fecal matter from pens in which birds were housed as groups showed no Bdellovibrio contamination after dosing. Predatory Bdellovibrio administered orally to birds that had previously received a prior dose of a type 4 phage strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis that colonizes the gut (a major zoonotic pathogen) significantly reduced Salmonella numbers in the cecal contents of the gut of birds. birds and reduced abnormal cecal morphology, indicating reduced cecal inflammation, compared to ceca from untreated controls or a non-predatory Î”pilA strain, suggesting that these effects were due to predatory action.

To better understand its complex epidemiology, involving multiple virus serotypes and host species, we characterized viruses recovered from FMD outbreaks in Ethiopia during 1981-2007. We detected 5 of the 7 FMD virus serotypes (O, A, C, Southern African Territories [SAT] 1 and SAT 2). Serotype O predominated, followed by serotype A; type C was not recognized after 1983. Phylogenetic analysis of virus protein 1 sequences indicated the appearance of a new topotype within serotype O, East Africa 4. In 2007, serotype SAT 1 was detected in Ethiopia and formed a new distinct topotype (IX), and serotype SAT 2 reappeared after an apparent interval of 16 years.

Applications for such sensors range from ensuring environmental monitoring to providing diagnostic measures for human health and early warning systems for bioterrorism. Certain pathogenic viruses and bacteria are of particular concern for their ability to spread rapidly in human populations during a pandemic, and emerging variants of these pathogens are difficult to detect. This article provides a reliable screening strategy to classify viruses from innocuous proteins. Our novel instrumentation is based on pyrolysis gas chromatography differential mobility spectrometry (PY/GC/DMS) and combines a genetic algorithm-based machine learning method for pattern recognition with a microfabricated solid-state biosensor. Together, this combination of hardware and software enabled extremely high classification accuracy (94%) among bacteriophage T4 bovine serum albumin (BSA), an unrelated protein.

100,"Evaluation of oxidative stress through total antioxidant status, sialic acid, malondialdehyde and RT-PCR findings in sheep affected with bluetongue","INTRODUCTION: Bluetongue (BT) is a non-contagious infectious disease of ruminants. The pathogenic agent bluetongue virus (BTV) is classified in the Orbivirus family of Reoviridae. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine serum malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant stress (TAS), total sialic acid (TSA), ceruloplasmin, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma- of glutamyltransferase (GGT), cholesterol, creatinine, albumin and total protein in sheep with and without bluetongue (BT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 13 crossbred Sakiz sheep, 1 to 4 years old and generally in the last stage of gestation, as a BT group and a control group composed of 10 healthy sheep. All sheep were clinically examined before blood samples were collected. Serum levels of ALT, AST, cholesterol, triglycerides, albumin, GGT, total protein, creatinine, and TAS were measured using commercially available kits according to manufacturer's recommendations using an automated biochemistry analyzer (Sinnowa D280, China). Serum lipid peroxidation was estimated using a previously described method in which MDA reacts with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) to form a colored complex at an absorbance maximum of 535 nm. The TSA value was measured at 549 nm using the method described by Warren (1959): sialic acid was oxidized to formyl-pyruvic acid, which reacts with TBA to form a pink product. Ceruloplasmin concentration was measured according to Sunderman and Nomoto (1970): ceruloplasmin and p-phenylenediamine formed a colored oxidation product that was proportional to serum ceruloplasmin concentration. Real-time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR were performed as described by Shaw et al. (2007). RESULTS: Biochemical analysis of serum showed that in the BT group, TSA, MDA, triglycerides, and ALT and AST were higher and ceruloplasmin and TAS were lower than in the control group. Serum albumin, cholesterol, creatinine, total protein, and GGT did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentrations of triglycerides, ceruloplasmin, TSA, MDA and TAS may be beneficial for the diagnosis, prognosis and biochemical analysis of BT.",,"Aytekin, I.;Aksit, H.;Sait, A.;Kaya, F.;Aksit, D.;Gokmen, M.;Baca, A.

Electric vehicles have posed a threat to children around the world, with outbreaks of aseptic meningitis and hand, foot and mouth disease being reported frequently. OBJECTIVE: To identify the EV strains circulating among healthy children in a small community in Limbe, Cameroon, two years apart. STUDY DESIGN: EV species and types were obtained by partial 5'UTR-VP4 and VP1 RNA sequencing of stool samples collected in October 2009 and September 2011 from 150 children in Cameroon. RESULTS: In total, 74 children (49%) were infected with 28 different types of EV. There were 29 (54%) children infected in 2009 and 45 (47%) in 2011. There was a significant difference between detected species of EV, with 15 (47%) children infected with EV-A in 2009 and 22 (71%) with EV-B in 2011 (p=0.0001). In 2009, a child was infected with a divergent EV, which was very similar to EV-A90. Based on the complete sequence of VP1, it was shown to be a new EV designated EV-A119. CONCLUSION: The current study shows a high heterogeneity of circulating EV types among children in Limbe, Cameroon, and a previously undescribed shift in predominant EV species.",,"Ayukekbong, J.;Kabayiza, J.

In recent years, HCV-related sequences have been found in bats, rodents, horses, and dogs, indicating a wide distribution of hepaciviruses among animals. By applying unbiased high-throughput sequencing, a new virus of the Hepacivirus genus was discovered in a bovine serum sample. De novo assembly produced a genome encoding a nearly full-length 2,779 amino acid polyprotein. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the virus represents a new species within the genus Hepacivirus. Detection of viral RNA found that 1.6% (n = 5) of 320 individual animals and 3.2% (n = 5) of 158 investigated cattle herds in Germany tested positive for bovine hepacivirus. Repeated reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyzes of animals from a dairy herd showed that a substantial percentage of cows were infected, some of them viraemic for more than 6 months. Clinical and post-mortem examination revealed no signs of disease, including liver damage.

108,Surveillance and characterization of low pathogenic H5 avian influenza viruses isolated from wild migratory birds in Korea,"Migratory waterfowl are the natural reservoir for influenza A viruses. However, interspecies transmission has occasionally caused outbreaks in various hosts, including humans. To characterize the genetic origins of H5 avian influenza viruses isolated from migratory birds in South Korea, phylogenetic analyzes were performed. A total of 53 H5 viruses were isolated between October 2005 and November 2008. Full genetic characterization indicated that most of these viruses belong to the Eurasian-type avian lineage. However, some segments of isolates AB/Korea/W235/07 and AB/Korea/W236/07 clustered with viruses of the North American lineage rather than those of the Eurasian lineage, suggesting the occurrence of reassortment between these two lineages of avian viruses. Phylogenetic analysis further demonstrated that the isolated H5N2 and H5N3 viruses were of the low pathogenicity H5 phenotype. H5 viruses appear to be antigenically similar to each other, but could be distinguished from a recent HPAI H5N1 virus (EM/Korea/W149/06) by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays. Experimental inoculation of representative viruses indicated that certain isolates, particularly AB/Korea/W163/07 (H5N2), could be detected in the trachea and lungs of chickens, but none could be transmitted by direct contact. Furthermore, all viruses could be detected in mouse lung without prior adaptation, which is indicative of their pathogenic potential in a mammalian host.

Cross-species (including zoonotic) poxvirus infections can have drastic consequences for the recipient host. Bats are a diverse order of mammals known to carry deadly viral zoonoses such as rabies, Hendra, Nipah, and SARS. Subsequent targeted research is revealing that bats are infected with a rich diversity of new viruses. Poxviruses were recently identified in bats, and the environments in which they were found were dramatically different. Here we review the natural history of poxviruses in bats and highlight the viruses' relationship to one another and their context in the family Poxviridae. In addition to considering the zoonotic potential of these viruses, we reflect on the broader implications of these findings. Specifically, the potential to explore and exploit this new relationship to study interspecies coevolution and transmission along with fundamental aspects of poxvirus host tropism, as well as bat virology and immunology. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Baker, K.

Recent studies have shown a high diversity of paramyxoviruses in an urban population of straw-colored fruit bats in Ghana. Here, we investigate this further through virus isolation and describe two novel rubulaviruses: Achimota virus 1 (AchPV1) and Achimota virus 2 (AchPV2). The viruses form a phylogenetic group with each other and with other bat-derived rubulaviruses, such as Tuhoko viruses, Menangle virus, and Tioman virus. We developed specific serological assays for AchPV1 and AchPV2 and found evidence of infection with both viruses in Eidolon helvum in sub-Saharan Africa and on islands in the Gulf of Guinea. Longitudinal sampling of E. helvum indicates virus persistence within fruit bat populations and suggests spread of AchPV through horizontal transmission. We also detected possible serological evidence of human infection with AchPV2 in Ghana and Tanzania.

113,Sequence and phylogenetic analyzes of structural genes of virulent isolates and vaccine strains of PPR virus from India,"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute, highly contagious, notifiable and economically important transboundary viral disease of sheep and goats. In this study, the sequence and phylogenetic analyzes of the structural protein genes, namely the nucleocapsid (N), matrix (M), fusion (F), and hemagglutinin (H) coding sequences of strains virulent and vaccine strains of PPR virus (PPRV), were carried out to determine genetic variations between field isolates and vaccine strains. The open reading frame (ORF) of these genes from the isolates/strains was amplified by RT-PCR, cloned and sequenced. The ORF of the N, M, F and H genes were 1578, 1008, 1641 and 1830 nucleotides (nt) in length and encoded polypeptides of 525, 335, 546 and 609 amino acids (aa), respectively, as previously reported. Comparative sequence analyzes of these four isolate/strain genes were performed with published sequences. It revealed an identity of 97.7-100% and 97.7-99.8% between the Asian IV lineage and 89.6-98.7% and 89.8-98.9% with other PPRV lineages at levels of nt and yy, respectively. Phylogenetic analyzes of these isolates based on aa sequences showed that all viruses belonged to lineage IV along with other Asian isolates. This is in agreement with previous observations that only PPRV lineage IV is in circulation in India since the disease was first reported. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the thermostable/thermoadapted vaccine strains showed no significant changes in the sequences of genes encoding functional or structural surface proteins. It is important to monitor PPRV circulation in susceptible animals using H-gene-based sequence comparisons in addition to F-gene and N-gene-based approaches to identify the distribution and spread of the virus in regular outbreaks occurring in endemic countries. as India ©2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,"Balamurugan, V.;Sen, A.;Venkatesan, G.;Yadav, V.;Bhanot, V.;Riyesh, T.;Bhanuprakash, V.;Singh, R.

114,Infectious bronchitis virus in different avian physiological systems: a field study in Brazilian poultry flocks,"Avian infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious viral disease with economic effects on the poultry industry. The disease presents multisystem clinical signs (respiratory, renal, enteric and reproductive) and is caused by a coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus, IBV). Infectious bronchitis virus is classified into different serotypes and genotypes (vaccine strains and field variants). This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of IBV in commercial poultry flocks from 3 important producing regions of Brazil and to determine the tropism of the main circulating genotypes to 3 different avian physiological systems (respiratory, digestive, urinary/reproductive). Clinical samples with signs suggestive of IBV infection were collected from 432 different commercial poultry flocks (198 broilers and 234 breeders). The total number of biological samples consisted of organ pools from the above 3 physiological systems obtained from farms in 3 major producing regions: Midwest, Northeast, and South. Infectious bronchitis virus was detected by real-time PCR with reverse transcription of the 5â€² untranslated region. Results showed 179 IBV-positive flocks (41.4% of flocks), with 107 (24.8%) broilers and 72 (16.8%) breeders. There were similar frequencies of IBV-positive flocks on farms in different regions of the country, with higher frequency in broilers (mean 54%) compared to breeders (mean 30.8%). reverse transcription was detected more frequently in the digestive system of breeders (40%), and in the digestive (43.5%) and respiratory (37.7%) systems of broilers. Infectious bronchitis virus genotyping was performed by nested reverse transcription PCR and S1 gene sequencing of a selection of 79 IBV-positive flocks (45 broilers and 34 breeders). More flocks were infected with the Brazilian variant genotype than the Massachusetts vaccine genotype. These results demonstrate the predominance of the Brazilian variant (mainly in the enteric tract) in commercial poultry flocks from 3 important producing regions of Brazil. © 2014 Poultry Science Association Inc.",,"Balestrin, E.;Fraga, A.

116,Complete genome sequence analysis of a wild-type Hungarian PRRSV type 2 variant unrelated to MLV isolated in Europe,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) is a widespread pathogen of swine causing significant economic losses to the swine industry. The growing diversity of PRRSV strains makes it increasingly difficult to diagnose, control and eradicate the disease. In the present study, the authors report on the complete genome sequencing of a PRRSV type 2 strain isolated from piglet carcasses in Hungary. Next-generation sequencing was used to determine the complete genome sequence of the isolate (PRRSV-2/Hungary/102/2012). Recombination analysis performed with the available full genome sequences showed no evidence of such an event with another known PRRSV. Single deletions and an insertion in the nsp2 region of PRRSV-2/Hungary/102/2012 were found when compared to the highly virulent prototype strains VR2332 and JXA-1. Most of the amino acid alterations in GP4 and GP5 of the virus were in the known antigenic regions, suggesting an important role for immunological pressure in the evolution of PRRSV-2/Hungary/102/2012. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that it belongs to PRRSV type 2 lineage 1 or 2. Considering the lack of related PRRSV in Europe, except for a partial sequence from Slovakia, the ancestor of PRRSV-2/Hungary/102/2012 was probably shipped from North America.

117,Two amino acid changes at the N-terminus of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus spike protein result in loss of enteric tropism,"To study the molecular basis of TGEV tropism, a library of recombinants was generated between the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) strain PUR46-MAD, which infects the enteric and respiratory tracts, and the PTV strain, which only infects the respiratory tract. The frequency of recombinant isolation was approximately 10 -9 recombinants per nucleotide and was 3.7 times higher at the 5' end of the S gene than at other areas of the genome. Thirty recombinants were plaque purified and phenotypically and genetically characterized. All recombinant viruses were single crossing over and inherited the 5' and 3' halves of their genome from enteric and respiratory parents, respectively. Recombinant viruses were classified into three groups, designated 1 to 3, based on the location of the crossover. The Group 1 recombinants had the crossover in the S gene, while in Groups 2 and 3 the crossovers were located at ORF1b and ORF1a, respectively. The tropism of the recombinants was studied. Group 1 recombinants had enteric and respiratory tropism, while Group 2 recombinants infected the respiratory tract, but not the enteric tract. Viruses from both groups differed by two nucleotide changes at positions 214 and 655. Both changes may be, in principle, responsible for loss of enteric tropism, but only the change at nucleotide 655 was found specifically in respiratory and respiratory isolates. it is most likely that this single nucleotide change, leading to a substitution at amino acid 219 of protein S, was responsible for the loss of enteric tropism in the closely related PUR46 isolates. The available data indicates that to infect enteric tract cells with TGEV, two different domains of the S protein are involved, mapping between amino acids 522 and 744 and around amino acid 219, respectively. The first domain binds porcine aminopeptidase N, the cellular receptor for TGEV. In the other domain maps a second factor of undefined nature but that may be the binding site of a co-receptor essential for the enteric tropism of TGEV.",,"Ballesteros, M. L.;SÃ¡nchez, C.

118,Investigation of FMD outbreaks in the Mbala and Kazungula districts of Zambia,"Foot-and-mouth disease is an acute and highly contagious viral infection of domestic and wild cloven-hoofed animals. It is known to be endemic in Zambia, with periodic outbreaks in different geographic areas of the country. This study was carried out to investigate the presence of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in reported suspected cases of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in the Kazungula and Mbala districts of Zambia. Sixty epithelial tissues or oesophageal-pharyngeal (OP) scrapings (probang samples) were collected from Mbala (n = 51) and Kazungula (n = 9) and examined for FMD virus. Viral RNA and FMD virus serotypes were examined by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Twenty-two samples (36.7%) were positive for FMD virus genome by qRT-PCR with cycle threshold (Ct) values ranging from 13 to 31. Samples positive for FMD virus from Epithelial tissues showed relatively higher Ct values compared to those obtained from OP scrapings, regardless of geographic location. Forty percent (40%; n = 4) of Mbala epithelial tissues were serotyped as SAT 2 serotype by antigen ELISA. Kazungula samples were serotyped at SAT 1. These findings indicated that Mbala and Kazungula districts had FMD outbreaks in 2012 that were attributed to at least SAT 2 and SAT 1 serotype field strains of FMD virus. . In addition, regular interaction between buffalo in Mosi-o Tunya Park and domestic animals in surrounding areas could contribute to regular outbreaks of FMD in Kazungula, while uncontrolled movements of animals across the borders between Mbala and Nsumbawanga could be responsible for disease outbreaks in Mbala. . In-depth molecular biology studies, including virus sequencing and phylogeny, should be undertaken to elucidate the complex FMD epidemiology in Zambia, thus providing valuable information needed for the rational FMD control strategy in Zambia and the neighbor countries.",,"Banda, F.;Kasanga, C.

119,Isolation and metagenomic identification of avian leukosis virus associated with mortality in broilers,"Avian leukosis virus (ALV) belongs to the Retroviridae family and causes considerable economic losses to the poultry industry. Following an outbreak associated with high mortality in a broiler flock in the northern part of Malaysia, kidney tissues from affected chickens were submitted for virus isolation and identification in embryonated chicken eggs and MDCK cells. Evidence of virus growth was indicated by hemorrhage and embryonic mortality in egg culture. While viral growth in cell culture was evidenced by the development of cytopathic effects. The isolated virus was purified by sucrose gradient and identified by transmission electron microscopy with negative staining. Further confirmation was achieved through next-generation sequencing and nucleotide sequence homology search. Analysis of viral sequences using the NCBI BLAST tool revealed 99-100% sequence homology to the exogenous ALV viral envelope protein. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial envelope sequences showed that the Malaysian isolate clustered with Taiwanese and Japanese ALV strains, which were closer to ALV subgroup J, ALV subgroup E, and recombinant A/E isolates. Based on these findings, it was concluded that ALV was associated with the current outbreak.

120,Unique genomic organization of a new Avipoxvirus detected in turkey (Meleagris gallopavo),"Avipoxviruses are emerging pathogens that affect more than 200 bird species worldwide. The genetic characterization of avipoxviruses is performed by analyzing the genomic regions that encode 4b and DNA polymerase. Whole genome sequence data is limited to a few avipoxvirus isolates. Based on phylogenetic analysis, three main genetic clades are distinguished. In this study we report on a new strain of avipoxvirus that causes skin lesions in domestic turkeys. The virus was identified in Hungary during 2011 in a flock of turkeys vaccinated against avipoxvirus infection. The genome of the isolate, TKPV-HU1124/2011, was extremely short (~188.5 kbp) and was predicted to encode a small number of proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of genes encoding 4b and DNA polymerase separated TKPV-HU1124/2011 from other avipoxviruses of turkey origin and classified it into a new genetic clade.

However, the deep evolutionary dynamics of PPRV during an epidemic are not well understood. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the genomic sequences of 25 PPRV strains from the 2013-2014 China outbreaks. All these strains were grouped into a new clade in lineage 4. An evolutionary rate of 2.61 × 10âˆ'6 nucleotide substitutions per site per day was estimated, dating to the most recent common ancestor of PPRV strains China 2013-2014 in early August 2013.

123,Isolation and whole genome sequencing of two reticuloendotheliosis virus strains from mixed infections with Marek's disease virus in China,"Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), classified as a gammaretrovirus, has a variety of hosts, including chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, and wild birds. REV causes a number of pathological syndromes, especially host immunosuppression, which can lead to increased susceptibility to other pathogens, seriously harming the poultry industry. Mixed infections of REV and Marek's disease virus (MDV) have been reported in many countries, including China. Previous reports revealed that MDV vaccines were not effective, and even less virulent MDV strains would cause some losses due to mixed REV infections. Furthermore, contaminants in the MDV vaccine could be the main source of REV. In this study, two clinical samples were collected from two batches of chickens that were diagnosed with MDV. Subsequently, two REV isolates were obtained from the clinical samples. The isolates, designated CY1111 and SY1209, were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy. The complete genomic sequences of the two REV strains were determined to test the relationship between them and other REV strains. Phylogenetic trees showed that the two REV strains were closely related to most REV strains that were isolated from a variety of hosts. Therefore, REVs could spread freely between these hosts under natural conditions. Furthermore, most of the REV strains in China were in the same clade.

In 2011, a new Orthobunyavirus was discovered in Northern Europe causing birth defects and abortions in ruminants. From field studies, Culicoides were implicated in the transmission of this virus, which was later named Schmallenberg virus (SBV), but no assessment of the susceptibility of populations to infection has been carried out to date. field under standardized laboratory conditions. We evaluated the influence of membrane type (chicken skin, collagen, Parafilm M®) when offered together with an artificial blood feeding system (Hemotek, UK) on blood feeding rates of Culicoides collected in the field. Susceptibility to SBV infection after blood feeding was then compared in a suspension of SBV blood provided via (i) the Hemotek system or (ii) a saturated cotton pellet. Schmallenberg virus susceptibility was defined by RT-qPCR of RNA extractions from head homogenates and related to Culicoides species and haplotype identifications based on the DNA barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene. (cox1). Results: Culicoides blood feeding rates were low on all membrane types tested (7.5% chicken skin, 0.0% collagen, 4.4% Parafilm M®, with 6029 female Culicoides who were offered a full blood meal). Susceptibility to SBV infection via membrane blood feeding (8 of 109 individuals tested) and pellet blood feeding (1 of 94 individuals tested) was demonstrated for the Obsoletus complex, both with C. obsoletus ( Meigen) as with C. scoticus Downes & Kettle susceptible to SBV infection through oral feeding. Potential evidence of cryptic species within UK populations for Obsoletus complex was found in phylogenetic analyzes of cox1 DNA barcodes from 74 individuals assessed at a single field site. Conclusions: The methods described in this study provide the means to blood feed Culicoides Palaearctic for vector competition studies and colonization attempts. Susceptibility to SBV infection was 7.3% for membrane-fed members of the Avaritia subgenus and 1.1% for pellet-fed members.

125,Mechanisms of persistence in tick-borne diseases,"The use of new highly sensitive diagnostic methods has revealed that persistent infections are a common feature of different tick-borne diseases, such as babesiosis, anaplasmosis and heart disease. Antigenic variation may contribute to disease persistence through the continual elaboration of new surface structures, and we know in several cases how this is achieved. Known or suspected mechanisms of persistence in babesial parasites include cytoadhesion and rapid adhesive ligand variation in Babesia bovis and genetic diversity in several merozoite-stage proteins from different Babesia species. In Anaplasma, a wide variation in the pfam01617 gene family accompanies the cycling of organism levels in chronic infection. One of the results of the pioneering research at Onderstepoort is the definition of a family of related polymorphic genes that are likely to be involved in immunity against heart disease. We are beginning to understand the sizes of antigenic repertoires and full definition is near, with the possibility of applying simultaneous high-throughput sequencing of the order of 1000 small genomes. Also, for the first time, we can consider modifying these genomes and look at the effects on persistence and virulence. However, important biological questions remain unanswered; for example, why we are seeing a new emerging Anaplasma infection in humans and is infection of endothelial cells by Anaplasma significant for persistence in vivo.",,"Barbet, A.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques are applied to detect PCV-2 antigen in animal tissue lesions. However, asymptomatic or subclinical pigs infected with PCV-2 can shed the virus in the herd. The serological survey in apparently healthy pigs could suggest the risk of virus entry. In this work, antigens and antibodies against PCVS-2 were investigated in pigs from commercial farms from seven and eight mesoregions of the State of Minas Gerais (MG). Thirty-two pigs aged five to eleven weeks showing clinical signs of MDS were necropsied. PCV-2 antigens were investigated from slaughtered pigs (Group I) and diagnostic demand samples (Group II) by IHC. 7.60% and more than 60% of the first and second groups, respectively, were positive for viral antigen. In both, the intense labeling of macrophages and histiocytes, especially in lymph nodes and lung, showed CVS-2 antigens. In parallel, the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) was applied to the antibody against PCV-2 examined in 955 pigs from 35 full-cycle commercial farms from the same mesoregions.

An extensive review is made of the main studies that have recently appeared in the scientific literature on the new 2nd generation rotavirus vaccines authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and also in the United States. Although the two vaccines authorized in Spain are based on different active ingredients, they have a common objective, the prevention of severe diarrhea due to rotavirus in children. Large safety study designs including more than 70,000 children have been required due to events that have occurred with Rotashield® (the first human-bovine reassortant rotavirus vaccine used in the United States and now withdrawn from the market) and its association with intussusception. It has been sufficiently demonstrated that there is no increased risk of intussusception associated with vaccination with both Rotarix® and RotaTeq™ vaccines. Trials on efficacy, immunogenicity, adverse events, etc. have also been reviewed. They have been statistically significant and sufficiently tested within permissible ranges relative to placebos. A list of recently issued ACID (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendations for RotaTeq™ is provided. Several of the pharmacoeconomic studies found in the literature are briefly discussed, some of them being cost-effective, although more advanced ones will be necessary once the vaccines are working and the immunization prices established for the public health system. Finally, the opportunities, challenges and prospects of current second-generation vaccines are discussed. In some of the futures, the difficulties they will have to face are indicated. It is concluded on the importance of convincing pediatricians about the use of these new vaccines, raising awareness among parents, providing health education to both regulatory authorities and themselves to include it within the usual vaccination practice. This requires pharmacoeconomic studies, with updated and real costs of the disease.",,"Barrio Corrales, F.;Cuenca Burgos, M. J.;GarcÃ­a FernÃ¡ndez, M. A.;Trillo BelizÃ³n, C.",2006.0,,,0
133,Molecular epidemiology of bluetongue virus in Portugal during the 2004-2006 outbreak,"After 44 years of epidemiological silence, the bluetongue virus (BTV) was reintroduced in Portugal in the fall of 2004. The first clinical cases of bluetongue disease (BL) were reported in sheep farms located in the south of Portugal, near the Spanish border. A total of six BTVs, five serotype 4 and one serotype 2, were isolated from sheep and cattle during the 2004-2006 epizootics. The nucleotide sequence of the L2, S7 and S10 gene segments of the prototype strain BTV-4 (BTV4/22045/PT04) obtained from the initial outbreak and of BTV-2 (BTV2/26629/PT05) was fully determined and compared with that of other parts of the world. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BTV4/22045/PT04 is related to other BTV-4 strains circulating in the Mediterranean basin since 1998, showing the highest identity (99%) with 2003 BTV-4 isolates from Sardinia and Corsica, while BTV2/26629/PT05 is almost indistinguishable from the live attenuated vaccine strain BTV-2 from Onderstepoort and its related field strain isolated in Italy. Since the live attenuated BTV-2 vaccine was never used in Portugal, the isolation of this strain may represent a natural circulation of the vaccine virus used in other Mediterranean European countries. © 2007 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Barros, S.

134,Macrophage infection by a lymphotropic herpesvirus: a new tropism for Marek's disease virus,"Marek's disease virus (MDV) is classified as an oncogenic lymphotropic herpesvirus of chickens. MDV productively and cytolytically infects B, αÎ²T, and γÎ´T lymphocytes and latently infects helper T lymphocytes. The aims of this study were to identify whether MDV infects macrophages in vivo and, if so, whether quantitative differences in macrophage infection are associated with MDV strain virulence. Chickens were infected with virulent MDV (HPRS-16) or ""hypervirulent"" MDV (C12/130). Flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies recognizing MDV pp38 antigen and leukocyte antigens was used to identify cells lytically infected by MDV. Macrophages from chickens infected with HPRS-16 and C12/130 were pp38+. Macrophages are shown to be pp38+ because they are infected and not because they have phagocytosed MDV antigens, assessed by confocal microscopy using antibodies that recognize MDV antigens from all three herpesvirus kinetic classes: infected cell protein 4 (ICP4, immediate early), pp38 (early) and glycoprotein B (gB, late). Spleen macrophages from MDV-infected chickens were ICP4+, pp38+ and gB+, and ICP4 had a nuclear localization indicating infection. Finally, MDV pp38+ macrophages had high inherent mortality rates, confirming cytolytic MDV infection, although viral particle production has not yet been detected. These results have two fundamental implications for understanding the pathogenesis of MDV: (i) MDV evolved to disrupt innate as well as acquired immunity, and (ii) macrophages are excellent candidates for transporting MDV to primary lymphoid organs during early stages of pathogenesis.",,"Barrow, A.

Taxonomically, it is a heterogeneous group of vertebrate viruses found in several viral families. With one exception, African swine fever virus, all TBVs have an RNA genome. To date, at least 160 tick-borne viruses are known, some of which pose a significant threat to human and animal health worldwide. Recently, several established TBVs have re-emerged and spread to new geographic locations due to the influence of anthropogenic activities and few available vaccines. In addition, new emerging tick-borne diseases are constantly being reported. Major advances in molecular biotechnologies have led to the discovery of new TBVs and further genetic characterization of unclassified viruses, leading to changes in the TBV classification created by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses. Although TBVs spend more than 95% of their life cycle within tick vectors and the role of ticks as vectors has been known for more than 100 years, our understanding of TBVs and the molecular processes involved in virus-virus interactions tick is scarce.",,"BartÃ­kovÃ¡, P.;HolÃ­kovÃ¡, V.;KazimÃ­rovÃ¡, M.;Å tibrÃ¡niovÃ¡, I.",2017.0,,10.4149/av_2017_403,0

Since 2010, cases have been reported in areas near the north, where, in 2011, both lineage 1a and 2 were detected. We describe here two new WNV whole genome sequences from human cases of WNV infection that occurred in 2011 in the Veneto region. Phylogenetic analysis showed that both genomic sequences belonged to lineage 1a and were related to WNV strains of the Western Mediterranean subtype. The new WNV genomes had a large nucleotide and amino acid sequence divergence from each other and from the WNV strain circulating in Italy in 2008-2009.

138,Swine influenza virus in North Vietnam in 2013-2014 article,"Pigs are an important intermediate host for the emergence of pandemic influenza. Vietnam is the largest pig producer in Southeast Asia. Systematic virological and serological surveillance for swine influenza viruses was carried out in northern Vietnam from May 2013 to June 2014 with monthly sampling of pigs in large and local collective slaughterhouses and in a live pig market. The seroprevalence of influenza A in local slaughterhouses and in the large collective slaughterhouse was 48.7% and 29.1%, respectively. 77 influenza A viruses were isolated, all from the large collective slaughterhouse. Genetic analysis revealed six virus genotypes, including pandemic 2009 H1N1 (H1N1pdm09), human-derived H1N2 with H1, H3N2 and H1N1pdm09 rearrangements, and H3N2 triple rearrangement viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the swine and human H1N1pdm09 viruses showed evidence of repeated transmission from humans to pigs rather than the establishment of H1N1pdm09 as a distinct long-term lineage in pigs.

139,A new type of bovine papillomavirus of the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus,"Papillomaviruses are a diverse group of viruses that are known to infect a wide range of animal species. Bovine papillomaviruses (BPV) are divided into at least 21 genotypes (BPV1 to BPV21), with the majority of BPV isolates/strains described to date belonging to one of four genera, including Deltapapillomavirus, Xipapillomavirus, Epsilonpapillomavirus, and Dyoxipapillomavirus . Here, we describe the identification and genetic characterization of a new type of BPV in the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus. A farm in New York State, USA, reported chronic cases of vulvovaginitis in Holstein cows in 2016. Biopsies and/or swab samples collected from the vaginal mucosa were submitted for diagnostic investigation. Conventional diagnostic assays were negative, and vaginal swab samples underwent viral metagenomic sequencing. Notably, BLAST searches revealed a papillomavirus genome 7480 bp in length (67% nt sequence identity to BPV16). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the papillomavirus L1 gene identified here (tentatively named BPV22) revealed that it clusters with members of the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus. Interestingly, the recently identified BPV16, which was detected in fibropapilloma lesions in cattle, is also grouped within the Dyokappapapillomavirus group. However, each virus forms a separate branch on the phylogenetic tree. These results indicate that putative BPV22 represents the second BPV within the Dyokappapapillomavirus genus.",,"Bauermann, F.

140,Analysis of porcine circovirus type 1 detected in Rotarix vaccine,"metagenomic analysis of live human vaccines has recently shown the presence of porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) DNA in the pediatric vaccine Rotarix used in the prevention of acute gastroenteritis. Using real-time PCR for PCV1, PCV1 DNA titers in various lots of Rotarix were found to be in the range of 6-7 log10 copies per dose. Pretreatment of the reconstituted vaccine with nuclease Benzonase, followed by nucleic acid extraction and quantification of PCV1 DNA by real-time PCR, revealed no loss of PCV1 DNA titer compared to untreated controls. suggesting that the porcine viral DNA was present in the vaccine in an encapsid form. PCV1-permissive PS cells, human HEK293 and Vero cells, used for vaccine production, were infected with Rotarix or PCV1, respectively, and subjected to immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. Viral genomes were present in Rotarix-incubated and PCV1-infected cells, whereas viral transcription was only observed in PCV1-infected cells. Similarly, PCV1-specific protein expression was observed in PCV1-infected cells, but not in Rotarix-treated cells. Passage of the supernatant indicated productive infection in PCV1-infected PS cells, but not in HEK293 and Vero cells or in any cell line incubated with Rotarix. The PCV1 DNA present in Rotarix was protected from benzonase digestion; however, PCV1 was not recognized by immune electron microscopy and was unable to infect PS, HEK293, or Vero cells, suggesting that the large amount of PCV1 DNA present in Rotarix does not reflect a corresponding proportion of biologically active viral particles. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Baylis, S.

This study describes the identification and genetic characterization of a bovine enterovirus (BEV) strain isolated from a calf with diarrhea. Two different next-generation sequencing platforms were used. Shotgun metagenomics achieved by MinION sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) allowed the identification of BEV RNA from a cell culture isolate. BEV was then confirmed by a specific real-time RT-PCR assay. To achieve the complete genome of this isolate, the sequence reads obtained by MinION were combined with those originating from NextSeq500 (Illumina).

143,Genetic and antigenic characterization of new pestivirus genotypes: implications for classification,"Currently, the genus Pestivirus comprises the four approved species of bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1), BVDV-2, classical swine fever virus (CSFV), and border disease virus (BDV) and a fifth tentative species represented by a single strain. (H138) isolated from a giraffe in Kenya more than 30 years ago. To further address the problem of pestivirus heterogeneity, we have determined the complete coding sequences of Npro and E2 for several new pestivirus isolates. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis revealed that a pestivirus isolated in the 1990s in Africa is closely related to the H138 strain. In addition, several new pestiviruses isolated from sheep cluster together with the previously described strain V60 (Reno-1) isolated from reindeer, while one strain of ovine pestivirus (Gifhorn) differs significantly from all previously described pestiviruses, including BDV. We propose to name these mainly sheep-derived pestiviruses BDV-2 (V60-like isolates) and BDV-3 (Gifhorn); consequently, ""classical"" BDV isolates should be referred to as BDV-1. As an additional criterion for pestivirus segregation, the antigenic relatedness of isolated pestiviruses covering all major genotypes observed was studied by cross-neutralization assays. Analysis of antigenic similarities indicated the presence of seven major antigenic groups corresponding to BVDV-1, BVDV-2, CSFV, BDV-1, BDV-2, BDV-3 and ""giraffe"". Taking into account host origin, lack of differences in disease course, and the results of our genetic and antigenic analyses, we suggest that BDV-1, BDV-2, and BDV-3 should be considered as major genotypes within the species.

BVDV was detected in 13 persistently infected (PI) cattle with a non-cytopathogenic biotype, whereas in five animals with fatal mucosal disease, isolates from spleen samples were of the cytopathogenic biotype. To reveal the genetic typing of Croatian BVDV isolates, viral RNA was extracted from infected cell cultures and amplified by RT-PCR, with primers targeting the 5'-UTR gene and Npro, followed by direct sequencing of purified PCR products. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 5'-UTR genome region determined that all Croatian isolates belonged to BVDV genotype 1; 11 isolates with BVDV-lb virus and 7 with BVDV-If virus were grouped. The phylogenetic tree inferred by the Bayesian approach, using combined 5'-UTR/Npro, supported the grouping of Croatian isolates into two subgroups.

Molecular dating suggests that the redistribution events likely occurred in wild birds in Russia or Mongolia. In addition, 2 genetically distinct H5N5 viruses were detected in wild birds in the Netherlands.

Genotype 1 circulates in humans while genotype 4 in pigs in India. The present study was designed to investigate the presence of anti-HEV and HEV-RNA antibodies in the swine population of North India, to investigate the predominant genotype in it, and to compare it with other strains of swine and human HEV from India. Methods: A total of 67 serum samples from pigs of age period (1-6 months) were collected from Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Izatnagar, Bareily and subjected to anti-HEV IgG detection. and HEV RNA. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor joining method and evaluated using the inner branch test method with MEGA 4 software. Results: anti-HEV IgG and HEV RNA were found at 38.8 and 4, 5 percent of the pig samples studied, respectively. The above samples were found to be of genotype 4e. The three new sequences had nucleotide similarity to other porcine sequences in genotype 4 ranging from 80 to 98 percent.

148,Relationships and history of live vaccine strains against Newcastle disease,"Previously, NDV (Newcastle disease virus) strains were classified solely on the basis of virulence, but recently grouping based on the genetic relationships of the strains is the method of choice. Live vaccine strains belong to the mild (lentogenic) or moderately virulent (mesogenic) categories, unlike the highly pathogenic epidemic viruses of the velogenic group. Using their genetic properties and lineage, the location of the vaccine strains in 'the NDV world' can be seen as described below (Figure 1). 1. Lentegenic vaccine strains are found in two of the dozen resident NDV genotypes in chickens. One of them is American group 11 (comprising vaccine strains B-1, LaSota and F), the other is genotype I (with strains Ulster 2C, V4/Queensland and NDV-6/10) which also reside in wild waterfowl. 2. Mesogenic strains are also present in only two genotypes: group 11 (Roakin and Komarov strains) and Asian genogroup III (H and Mukteswar strains). 3. While the vaccine strains of groups I and 11 were naturally occurring, the H, Mukteswar and Komarov strains were artificially attenuated, as reported in the 1940s. However, discrepancies between the actual genetic identity and the postulated origin of the mesogenic vaccine strains (Figure 2). a) Since the mesogenic strain H is not related to the virulent Herts'33, its ostensible parent, the reduced virulence of H cannot be attributed to egg passage procedures performed in England and even the presence of this strain is an enigma . b) The H and Mukteswar strains with less than 0.3% nucleotide distance between them must have been derived from the same isolate, so they cannot be the result of independent developments in England and India. c) The reduced (mesogenic) virulence of the H/Mukteswar strain cannot be associated with attenuation either; most likely a natural Indian country isolate. d) The Komarov mesogenic strain, which is said to be attenuated through intracerebral passage in ducklings of a local velogenic virus in Palestine, is identical to the American (genotype 11) Roakin vaccine strain, for which no explanation can be given scientific.",,"Bela, L.",2008.0,Jun,,0
149,"New viruses in veterinary medicine, detected by metagenomic approaches","In our world, facing exceptional environmental changes and dramatically intensifying globalization, we face challenges due to many new factors, including the emergence or re-emergence of new, hitherto ""unknown"" infectious diseases. Although we have a wide arsenal of diagnostic methods at our disposal, most conventional diagnostic tests are either highly virus-specific or entirely directed at a limited set of infectious agents. This specificity complicates or even makes it difficult to detect new or unexpected pathogens, such as new, emerging, or re-emerging viruses or novel viral variants. Newly developed viral metagenomics approaches provide a novel and efficient way to screen samples and detect viruses without prior knowledge of the infectious agent, enabling better disease diagnosis and control, in line with the principles of ""One World, one health"" (www.oneworldonehealth.org). Using metagenomic approaches, we have recently identified a wide variety of new viruses, such as new bocaviruses, Torque Teno viruses, astroviruses, rotaviruses, and kobuviruses in swine disease syndromes, new virus variants in bee populations, as well as a range of other infectious agents. . in other host species.

150,Advances in the diagnosis of viral diseases and molecular epidemiological technologies,"Early and rapid detection and characterization of veterinary-medical pathogen-specific nucleic acids have proven invaluable for diagnostic purposes. The integration of signal amplification and detection systems, including real-time on-line devices, has increased speed and sensitivity and greatly facilitated the quantification of target nucleic acids. They have also allowed the characterization of sequences by means of fusion or hybridization curves. Next-generation molecular diagnostic technologies offer unprecedented detection and discrimination methodologies so far, which are vital for the detection and positive identification of pathogens, as well as the effects of pathogens on antibody production. The development phase of new technologies involves a deep understanding of accurate diagnosis and discrimination of present and emerging diseases. The development of novel technologies can only be successful if they are transferred and used in the field with quality-assured, sustainable application that enables optimal detection and effective control of diseases. The objective of these new tools is to detect the presence of a pathogenic agent before the appearance of the disease.

152,Propidium Monoazide (PMA) and Ethidium Bromide Monoazide (EMA) Improve DNA Array and High Throughput Sequencing of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus Identification,"Panviral DNA array (PVDA) and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) are useful tools to identify new viruses of emerging diseases. However, both techniques have difficulties in identifying viruses in clinical samples due to the content of host genomic nucleic acid (hg/cont). Both propidium monoazide (PMA) and ethidium bromide monoazide (EMA) have the ability to bind free DNA/RNA, but are impermeable to the cell membrane. Therefore, both are unable to bind to protected nucleic acid such as viral genomes within intact virions. However, genetic material modified by EMA/PMA cannot be amplified by enzymes. In order to evaluate the potential of EMA/PMA to reduce the presence of amplifiable hg/cont in samples and improve virus detection, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) was added to serum and lung tissue homogenates and processed. with EMA/WFP. In addition, clinical samples positive for PRRSV RT-qPCR were also analyzed. EMA/PMA treatments significantly reduced amplifiable hg/cont and significantly increased the number of PVDA-positive probes and their signal intensity compared to untreated enriched lung samples. EMA/PMA treatments also increased HTS sensitivity by increasing the number of PRRSV-specific reads and percent PRRSV coverage. Interestingly, EMA/PMA treatments significantly increased the sensitivity of PVDA and HTS in two of three clinical tissue samples. Therefore, EMA/PMA treatments offer a new approach to reduce amplifiable hg/cont in clinical samples and increase the success of PVDA and HTS in identifying viruses.",,"Bellehumeur, C.;Boyle, B.;Charette, S.

Gerna, M. Battaglia, G. Milenesi, N. Passarani, E. Percivalle, and E. Cattaneo, Infect. Immun 43:722-729, 1984). Three strains from beef herds were associated with the UK bovine rotavirus and NCDV strains defined as serotype 6 (Y. Hoshino, TG Wyatt, HB Greenberg, J. Flores and AZ Kapikian, J. Infect. Dis. 149:694 -702, 1984). Two other dairy herd strains were classified as bovine viruses related to bovine strain B223 reported by Woode et al. (GN Woode, NE Kelso, TF Simpson, SK Gaul, LE Evans and L. Babiuk, J. Clin. Microbiol 18:258 -264, 1983) in the United States. A serotyping antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunoassay for detecting serotype 6 rotavirus using a serotype 6-specific monoclonal antibody was developed and evaluated for strain characterization. Characterization of 72 group A rotavirus-positive fecal samples from beef herds and 43 fecal samples from dairy herds showed a predominance of rotavirus serotype 6 in beef herds, but rotavirus serotype 6 and not serotype 6 in dairy herds. .

156,Newcastle disease virus genotype diversity in Nigeria: challenges for disease control and future prospects,"Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most important avian diseases with a considerable threat to poultry productivity worldwide. The disease is associated with severe respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological injuries in chickens leading to high mortality and various other production-related losses. The etiology of the disease is an avian paramyxovirus type 1 or Newcastle disease virus (NDV), whose isolates are serologically grouped into a single serotype but are genetically classified into a total of 19 genotypes, due to the emergence and continuous evolution of the disease. virus. In Nigeria, molecular characterization of NDV is generally very sparse, focusing mainly on partial F gene amplification for genotyping. However, with the introduction of more objective NDV genotyping criteria using full-length fusion protein coding sequences in phylogenetic taxonomy, the enormous genetic diversity of the virus in Nigeria became very noticeable. In this review, we examine the current ecological distribution of various NDV genotypes in Nigeria based on available full-length fusion protein nucleotide sequences (1662 bp) in the NCBI database. We then discuss the challenges of ND control as a result of the large genetic distance between currently circulating NDV isolates and the most common vaccines used to combat the disease in the country. Finally, we suggest future directions in the war against the economically devastating ND in Nigeria.",,"Bello, M. B.;Yusoff, K. M.;Ideris, A.;Hair-Bejo, M.;Peeters, B. P. H.;Jibril, A.

157,"Novel polyphenol oxidase extracted from a bovine rumen metagenome expression library: biochemical properties, structural analysis and phylogenetic relationships","RL5, a gene encoding a novel polyphenol oxidase, was identified through detection of activity from a bovine rumen microflora metagenome expression library. Characterization of the recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli revealed a multipotent ability to oxidize a wide range of substrates (syringaldazine > 2,6-dimethoxyphenol > veratryl alcohol > guaiacol > tetramethylbenzidine > 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol > 2,2â€²-azino- bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) henol red) over an unusually wide pH range of 3.5 to 9.0. Apparent Km and kcat values for ABTS, syringaldazine, and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol obtained from steady-state kinetic measurements at 40 °C, pH 4.5 yielded values of 26, 0.43, and 0.45 μM. and 18, 660 and 1175 s-1, respectively. Km values for syringaldazine and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol are up to 5-fold lower, and kcat values up to 40-fold higher than previously reported values for this enzyme class. RL5 is a 4-copper oxidase with oxidation potential values of 745, 400, and 500 mV against a normal hydrogen electrode for copper sites T1, T2, and T3. A three-dimensional model of RL5 and site-directed mutants were generated to identify the copper ligands. Bioinformatic analysis of the gene sequence and neighboring gene sequences and contexts suggested a tentative phylogenetic assignment to the genus Bacteroides. Kinetic, electrochemical, and EPR analyzes provide unequivocal evidence that the hypothetical proteins from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and E. coli, which are closely related to the deduced protein encoded by the RL5 gene, are also multicopper proteins with polyphenol oxidase activity. The present study shows that these three newly characterized enzymes form a new family of functional multicopper oxidases with laccase activity related to hypothetical conserved proteins harboring the DUF152 domain of unknown function and suggests that some other of these proteins may also be laccases. © 2006 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Beloqui, A.;Pita, M.;Polaina, J.;MartÃ­nez-Arias, A.;Golyshina, O.

159,"Prioritization of zoonotic viral diseases at the interface of wild boar, domestic pigs and humans","INTRODUCTION: Understanding the ecology of disease requires an understanding of pathogens at the wildlife-livestock interface. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) are a health concern as countries work to prevent and control zoonotic diseases, as their populations pose environmental and health concerns due to infectious agents transmissible to domestic pigs and other animal species, including pigs. humans. OBJECTIVE: Prioritize zoonotic diseases at the interface of wild boars, domestic animals and humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The evidence-based semi-quantitative prioritization method included 27 criteria based on recent publications. According to viral etiology, we classify them into five categories: epidemiology (eight), prevention/control (three), economy/commerce (four), public health (nine), and society (three). Each criterion had a coefficient from 0 to 7 according to its evidence-based impact (maximum sum of 189). The evidence on the criteria for the nine viral diseases analyzed came from the review of 81 sources published between 1977 and 2015. RESULTS: The three main diseases with the highest score and zoonotic potential were swine influenza (133), hepatitis E (123) , and hantavirus infection (103), whose highest scores were observed in epidemiology and public health criteria. CONCLUSION: Semi-quantitative prioritization methods impartially contribute to evidence-based decision making; however, they are rarely used in developing countries due to a lack of public health surveillance data. Control of shared diseases requires the development of strategies to reduce transmission of pathogens between wildlife and domestic animals and humans.",,"Benavides-Arias, D.;Soler-Tovar, D.",2015.0,,10.7705/biomedica.v36i0.2950,0
160,Characterization of the surface proteins of influenza A (H5N1) viruses isolated from humans in 1997-1998,"Influenza A (H5N1) viruses infected humans in Hong Kong between May and December 1997. Sixteen viruses were isolated during this outbreak, including 6 fatal cases. Molecular analysis of the surface protein genes encoding hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from these H5N1 isolates, a subtype not known to infect humans, is presented. The 16 human H5 HA sequences contain multiple basic amino acids adjacent to the cleavage site, a motif associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses. The phylogenetic relationship between both avian and human H5 hemagglutinins indicates that the human isolates are directly related to the isolates that circulated among chickens in the five Hong Kong poultry markets before and during the human outbreak. HA sequences from human isolates and a recent chicken isolate represent a separate clade, within which there are two subgroups distinguished antigenically and by the presence of a potential glycosylation site. Likewise, the N1 neuraminidases from human H5 isolates represent a clade that is evolutionarily distinct from the previously characterized N1 neuraminidases. The NA genes of the recent human H5N1 virus are similar to those of birds, indicating a direct introduction from an avian source rather than the evolution of a human NA N1. The 16 human NA genes encode a shortened stem due to a 19 amino acid deletion, which is also found in recent avian isolates of H5N1 from Hong Kong. Two unique amino acids were identified in the N1 NAs of recent human isolates; however, it is not known whether these residues influence host range. Neither the HA nor NA genes of human H5N1 virus isolates show evidence of adaptive changes during the outbreak. Although analyzes of the surface protein genes of HSN1 viruses from this outbreak did not provide immediate answers regarding the molecular basis of virulence, the analyzes provided clues about potentially important areas of the genes that merit further investigation.",,"Bender, C.;Hall, H.;Huang, J.;Klimov, A.;Cox, N.;Hay, A.;Gregory, V.;Cameron, K.;Lim, W.;Subbarao, K.",1999.0,,10.1006/viro.1998.9529,0
161,Analysis of Variability in the Non-Coding Regions of Influenza A Viruses,"Influenza A virus (IAV) genomes comprise eight negative-sense single-stranded RNA segments. In addition to the protein coding region, each segment possesses 5' and 3' non-coding regions (NCRs) that are important for transcription, replication, and packaging. NCRs contain conserved and segment-specific sequences, and the impacts of variability on NCRs are not fully understood. The complete NCRs of some viruses have been determined, but a detailed analysis of the potential variability in these regions between viruses from different host groups and locations has not been performed. To assess the degree of conservation of NCRs among different viruses, we sequenced IAV NCRs isolated from different wild bird host groups (ducks, gulls, and seabirds). We then expanded our study to include the NCRs available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) influenza virus database, which allowed us to analyze a broader range of host species and more HA and NA subtypes. We found that the amount of variability within NCRs varies between segments, with the greatest variation found in the HA and NA segments and the least in the M and NS segments. In general, variability in NCR sequences correlated with coding region phylogeny, suggesting vertical co-evolution of CDS and NCR (coding sequence) regions.",,"Benkaroun, J.;Robertson, G.

162,Molecular techniques: new opportunities in light of adenovirus research,"Presenting his latest achievements in the field of adenovirus research, the author summarizes the new possibilities that reside in modern molecular techniques that have revolutionized virus diagnostic and research methods. Among the new methods, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has the greatest importance. Due to the large and increasing number of known virus serotypes, classical serological identification of new isolates has now become exceptionally cumbersome. Furthermore, reliable collections of reference strains and sera are rarely available in laboratories. PCR combined with sequencing provides a fast and efficient alternative. New viruses identified and classified by such methods are called types rather than serotypes. In different veterinary laboratories, numerous strains of adenoviruses that have been isolated in different veterinary laboratories in the last two decades have not yet been characterized. These viruses can now be typed and classified by sequence analysis of certain genes. The other great advantage of the method is that it allows the molecular characterization of non-isolated viruses. This is especially valuable for the study of adenoviruses from live wild animals when virus isolation is usually not a realistic option. The author's research group was the first in the world to determine the complete genome sequence of an adenovirus exclusively by PCR from infected organ samples from sick and dead birds without achieving successful virus isolation. Organ samples from different vertebrate animals found dead in zoos, pet stores, or in the wild are continuously analyzed by PCR in the author's laboratory. Faecal samples are equally suitable for screening purposes. In addition to birds and reptiles, a high rate of adenovirus infection among domestic bats was recently demonstrated.",,"Benko, M.",2011.0,Aug,,0

164,Does the common architecture reveal a viral lineage spanning all three domains of life?,"Our discovery that the major coat protein of bacteriophage PRD1 resembles that of human adenovirus raised the unexpected possibility that viruses that infect bacteria might be related by evolution to those that infect animal hosts. We first review the development of this idea. We then describe how we have used structure-based modeling to show that several other viruses without detectable sequence similarity are likely to have envelopes built from similar proteins: the ""double-barrel trimer."" There is evidence that the group includes a diversity of viruses that infect very different hosts in the three domains of life: Eukarya; bacteria; and Archaea that diverged billions of years ago. The current classification of viruses obscures such similarities. We propose that the appearance of a double-barrel trimer coat protein in a large-faceted icosahedral dsDNA virus, independently of its host, is a very strong indicator of its belonging to a virus lineage with a common ancestor.",,"Benson, S.

165,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever: History, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical syndrome, and genetic diversity","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most important tick-borne viral disease of humans, causing sporadic cases or outbreaks of serious disease in a large geographic area, from western China to the Middle East and southeastern Europe and in most of Africa. CCHFV is maintained in cycles of vertical and horizontal transmission involving ixodid ticks and a variety of wild and domestic vertebrates, which show no signs of disease. The virus circulates in several genera of ticks, but Hyalomma ticks are the main source of human infection, probably because both immature and adult forms actively seek hosts to feed on blood required at each stage of maturation. CCHF occurs most often among agricultural workers following the bite of an infected tick and, to a lesser extent, among slaughterhouse workers exposed to blood and tissue from infected cattle and medical personnel through contact with ticks. bodily fluids of infected patients. CCHFV is the most genetically diverse arbovirus, with nucleotide sequence differences between isolates ranging from 20% for the viral S segment to 31% for the M segment. Viruses with diverse sequences can be found within the same area geographically, while closely related viruses have been isolated from widely separated regions, suggesting that widespread spread of CCHFV has occurred at times in the past, possibly by ticks carried on migratory birds or through the international network. cattle trade. Rearrangement between genome segments during tick or vertebrate co-infection appears to have played an important role in generating diversity and represents a possible future source of new viruses. In this article, we first review the current understanding of CCHFV, summarizing its molecular biology, maintenance and transmission, epidemiology, and geographic range. We also include an extensive discussion of the genetic diversity of CCHFV, including virus range maps with overlaid phylogenetic trees. We then review the features of CCHF, including the clinical syndrome, diagnosis, treatment, pathogenesis, vaccine development, and laboratory animal models of CCHF. The document ends with a discussion of the possible future geographic range of the virus. For the benefit of researchers, we include a supplemental table listing all published reports of CCHF cases and outbreaks in the English-language literature, plus some main articles in other languages, with total number of cases, case-fatality rates, and all CCHFV strains in GenBank. © 2013 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Bente, D.

166,Genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of host-range genes of camelpox virus isolates from India,"Camelpox virus (CMLV), a close variant of smallpox virus (VARV), infects camels worldwide. Reported zoonotic infections in India signify the need to study host range genes, responsible for host tropism. We present the sequence and phylogenetic analysis of five host-range genes: cytokine response modifier B (crmB), chemokine-binding protein (ckbp), viral schlafen-like (v-slfn), T4 myxomavirus-like ( a M-T4) and b5r of VSMC isolated from outbreaks in India. Comparative analysis revealed that these genes are conserved among VSMCs and share 94.5-100% identity at both the nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) levels. All genes showed identity (59.3-98.4%) with bovine pox virus (CPXV), while three genes, crmB, ckbp and b5r, showed similarity (92-96.5%) with viruses viral smallpox at nt and aa levels. Interestingly, three consecutive serine residue insertions were observed in the CMLV-Delhi09 isolate CKBP protein that was similar to CPXV-BR and VACV, in addition to five point mutations (K53Q, N67I, F84S, A127T, and E182G) that were also similar. to zoonotic OPXV. Furthermore, few inconsistent point mutations in other genes were also observed among Indian VSMCs. These indicate that different VSMC strains are circulating in India and these mutations could play an important role in VSMC adaptation in humans. Phylogeny revealed the clustering of all VSMCs together except VSMC-Delhi09 which clustered separately due to the presence of specific point mutations. However, the topology of the concatenated phylogeny showed a close evolutionary relationship of VSMC with VARV and TATV followed by CPXV-RatGer09/1 from Germany.

The host tropism of poxviruses is governed by host range genes. Among the host range genes: E3L, K3L, and C7L are essential for virus replication by preventing interferon resistance, while B5R is essential for virus spread and evasion of the host immune response as in the case of the VACV virus. We present sequence analysis of the host range genes: E3L, K3L, C7L and membrane protein gene (B5R) of BPXV from buffalo, cattle and humans from recent outbreaks in India: their phylogenetic relationship with the BPXV strain. reference (BP4) and other orthopoxviruses. . BPXVs revealed sequence homology to VACV viruses, including VACV-like Brazilian zoonotic viruses. The aa sequences of the E3L and K3L genes were 100% similar in buffalo, bovine, and human isolates. However, four significant point mutations (I11K; N12K and S36F in the C7L gene and D249G in the B5R gene) specific to the buffalo isolate only were observed. This means that different strains of BPXV were circulating during the outbreak. Mutations in C7L and B5R could play an important role in BPXV adaptation in humans and cattle, requiring further functional studies. The BPXV strain isolated from buffaloes may not be adopted in humans and cows. Several point mutations were observed in host range genes of the reference strain (BPXV-BP4) which may be due to multiple passages of the virus in cell culture. Phylogeny constructed on the basis of concatenated gene sequences revealed that BPXVs are not as closely related to the vaccine strain (Lister and Lister-derived strain - LC16m8), as previously stated, but more closely related to the strain reference (BPXV-BP4) and other vaccinia and vaccinia-like viruses such as Passatempo and Aracatuba viruses.

169,Phage-bacteria relationships and CRISPR elements revealed by a metagenomic study of the rumen microbiome,"Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on the planet and play an important role in the balance of microbes within an ecosystem and facilitate horizontal gene transfer. Although bacteriophages are abundant in rumen environments, little is known about the types of viruses present or their interaction with the rumen microbiome. We carried out random pyrosequencing of virus-enriched metagenomes (viromes) isolated from bovine rumen fluid and analyzed the resulting data using comparative metagenomics. A high level of diversity was observed with up to 28,000 different viral genotypes obtained from each environment. The majority (~78%) of the sequences did not match any previously described virus. Prophages outnumbered lytic phages approximately 2:1 and the most abundant bacteriophage and prophage types were associated with members of the dominant ruminal phyla (Firmicutes and Proteobacteria). Metabolic profiling based on SEED subsystems revealed an enrichment of sequences with putative functional roles in DNA and protein metabolism, but a surprisingly low proportion of sequences assigned to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism.

170,Using non-invasive metagenomics to characterize wildlife viral communities,"Microbial communities play an important role in the health of organisms and ecosystems. While high-throughput meta barcoding has revolutionized the study of bacterial communities, generating comparable viral communities has proven difficult to achieve, particularly in wildlife samples where virus diversity and limited amounts of viral nucleic acid present distinctive challenges. Metagenomic sequencing is a promising solution for the study of viral communities, but the lack of standardized methods currently prevents comparisons between taxa or host localities. Here, we developed a non-targeted shotgun metagenomic sequencing protocol to generate comparable viral communities from non-invasively collected fecal and oropharyngeal swabs. Using samples from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus), a key species for virus transmission to humans and domestic animals, we tested how different storage media, nucleic acid extraction procedures, and enrichment steps affect detection of the virus. viral community. Based on the finding of viral contamination in fetal bovine serum, we recommend storing swabs in RNAlater or other non-biological media. We recommend extracting nucleic acid directly from the swabs rather than the supernatant or pellet, which had undetectable levels of viral RNA. Results from a low-input RNA library preparation protocol suggest that ribosomal RNA depletion and light DNase treatment reduce bacterial and host nucleic acid and improve virus detection. Finally, applying our approach to twelve pooled samples from seven localities in Peru, we show that detected viral communities were saturated at the achieved sequencing depth, allowing unbiased comparisons of viral community composition. Future studies using the methods described here will clarify the determinants of viral communities across host species, environments, and time.",,"Bergner, L. M.;Orton, R.

171,Antigenic and genetic characterization of rabies viruses isolated from domestic and wild animals in Brazil identifies the gray fox as a reservoir of rabies,"Fifty Brazilian rabies viruses, collected from many different animal species and from various regions of the country, were characterized by partial sequencing of the central variable region of the P gene, a useful locus for sensitive molecular epidemiological studies. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences, including comparison with other rabies strains recovered from the Americas, identified three main groups of Brazilian viruses, arbitrarily designated BRL-1 through BRL-3. BRL-1 was found in terrestrial carnivores and in groups with other American strains of the cosmopolitan lineage. BRL-2 comprised two distinct isolates, recovered from two species of nonblood-eating bats, that had evolutionary links to strains derived from North American insectivorous bats. BRL-3 consisted of isolates from vampire bats and from livestock species likely infected through contact with vampire bats. The terrestrial group was subdivided into three subtypes: BRL-1a was associated exclusively with dogs and cats, while BRL-1b and BRL-1c were found exclusively in gray foxes. These observations strongly support the role of the Brazilian gray fox as a reservoir for rabies.

No significant association could be established by seroepidemiology between HHV-7 and CFS. HHV-7 is a T-lymphotropic virus that infects primary CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. HHV-7 can also infect SUP-T1, an immature T cell line, with variable success. Southern blot analysis with DNA probes scanning 58.8% of the human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) genome and hybridization with all HHV-6 strains tested so far revealed homology to HHV-7 with only 37.4% of the total length of the probe. HHV-7 contains the repetitive sequence GGGTTA, as do HHV-6 and Marek's disease chicken herpesvirus.

174,Absence of FMD virus transmission from persistently infected cattle to naive cattle under field conditions in Vietnam,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), caused by foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV; Aphthovirus, Picornaviridae), is a highly contagious and economically important disease of domestic cloven-hoofed cattle and wildlife species worldwide. After the clinical phase of FMD, a large proportion of FMD virus-infected ruminants become persistently infected carriers, defined by detection of FMD virus in oropharyngeal fluid (OPF) samples 28 days or more after infection. The aim of this prospective study was to characterize the FMD carrier status in cattle after natural infection under typical husbandry practices in Vietnam. Ten persistently infected cattle in eight farms in Long An province in southern Vietnam were monitored by monthly examination of serum and oropharyngeal fluid samples for 12 months. To evaluate the transmission of FMD virus carriers, 16 non-exposed cattle were intentionally placed in direct contact with persistently infected animals for 6 months and were monitored by clinical and laboratory methods. The restricted median duration of FMD carrier status was 27.7 months, and the rate of decline in the proportion of carrier animals was 0.03 per month. There was no evidence of transmission to naïve animals throughout the study period. In addition, there was no detection of FMDV infection or seroconversion in three calves born to carrier animals during the study. The infection strength for carrier-to-contact transmission was 0 per month, with a 95% upper confidence limit of 0.064 per month. Phylogenetic analysis of viral protein 1 (VP1) coding sequences obtained from carriers indicated that all viruses recovered in this study belonged to the O/ME-SA/PanAsia lineage and clustered phylogenetically with temporally and geographically related viruses. Analysis of FMD virus evolution within the host, based on full-length open reading frame sequences recovered from consecutive samples from one animal, indicated that most of the non-synonymous changes occurred in L<sub>pro </sub>, VP2 and VP3 protein coding regions. This study suggests that the duration of persistent FMD virus infection in cattle may be longer than previously believed, but the risk of transmission is low. Additional novel insights into viral evolution within the host under natural conditions in an endemic setting are provided.",,"Bertram, M. R.;Vu, L. T.;Pauszek, S. J.;Brito, B. P.;Hartwig, E.

175,Vasculitis alérgica durante ORF,"ORF is an infectious disease of sheep and goats caused by a parapoxvirus. It can be transmitted to humans and is considered an occupational hazard for those who handle sheep. The authors describe a case of ORF associated with allergic vasculitis, with an evolution that suggests a pathogenic role of the virus. A 69-year-old woman presented with erythematous, target-like plaques suggestive of ORF. Ten days after the appearance of the first lesion, both nonblanchable purpuric papules and necrotic purpura were evident on the legs, ankles, and dorsum of the feet. Histological evaluation showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. These latter lesions disappeared within ten days without treatment. At the same time, three weeks after their appearance, the ORF lesions also resolved spontaneously. After a six-month follow-up, neither the ORF lesions nor the allergic vasculitis had recurred. Viral infections are well known as etiological factors of vasculitis. Many elements led us to consider this case of allergic vasculitis correlated with ORF virus infection: time of onset, duration, resolution related to the clinical course of ORF, no need for therapy for recovery, and a six-month follow-up. months without relapse This indicates the possibility of classifying the ORF virus within the group of viruses responsible for allergic vasculitides.",,"Bettoli, V.;Trovato, C.;La Malfa, W.;Pazzaglia, M.",1997.0,,,0
176,Dynamics of acute Montipora white syndrome: bacterial communities of healthy and diseased colonies of M. capitata during and after a disease outbreak,"Coral diseases contribute to the decline of coral reefs globally and threaten the health and future of coral reef communities. Acute Montipora White Syndrome (aMWS) is a tissue loss disease that has caused the mortality of hundreds of Montipora capitata colonies in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii in recent years. This study describes the analysis of coral-associated bacterial communities using high-throughput sequencing generated by the PacBio RSII platform. Samples from three health states of M. capitata (healthy, healthy-sick, and sick) were collected during an ongoing aMWS outbreak and a non-outbreak period and bacterial communities were identified to determine if a change in structure had occurred. of the community between the two. periods. Bacterial communities associated with outbreak and non-outbreak samples were significantly different, and an important factor was the high abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified as Escherichia spp. in the outbreak sequences. In silico bacterial source tracking suggested that this UTO was likely due to sewage contamination from livestock, rather than human origin. The most abundant coliform OTU was a cultivable isolate of E. fergusonii, strain OCN300; however, it did not induce signs of disease in healthy colonies of M. capitata when used in laboratory infection assays. Furthermore, screening of the sequencing result found that the most abundant OTUs corresponded to the previously described M. capitata pathogens. The synergistic combination of known coral pathogens, sewage contaminants, and other stressors, such as fluctuating seawater temperatures and bacterial pathogens, has the potential to intensify the decline of coral reef ecosystems.",,"Beurmann, S.;Ushijima, B.;Videau, P.;Svoboda, C.

177,Prospects for control and eradication of capripox from the Indian subcontinent: a perspective,"Sheep pox and goat pox, two capripox infections endemic to India, represent a major economic threat to the productivity of small ruminants in the subcontinent. Vaccination of all susceptible sheep and goats is the feasible and sustainable means of control. The availability of effective live attenuated vaccines that are inherently heat stable and the development of improved diagnostics provide an opportunity to initiate effective control measures for capripox. All animals older than 4 months can be vaccinated with current homologous vaccines by means of a single intradermal or subcutaneous vaccination. The success of the control program needs to be monitored by active surveillance, particularly to detect the presence of the virus, since seromonitoring does not differentiate between infection and vaccination. And furthermore, seroconversion after capripox vaccination is not sufficiently detectable with the available tools. Sustained control efforts require socioeconomic and political stability, adequate infrastructure, and logistical support to store and transport vaccines to reach remote end users. The availability of veterinary services, improved extension services for greater awareness among farmers, contribute significantly to control campaigns. Poor vaccination coverage and inadequate infrastructure in most of the country are some of the main elements standing in the way of effective implementation of building herd immunity through immunization. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",,"Bhanuprakash, V.;Hosamani, M.;Singh, R.

178,The current status of sheep pox,"The sheep are mobile banks of shepherds and their economic contribution in meat, wool and skins is immense. Various infectious diseases compromise optimal productivity; among which sheep pox is more important since the disease restricts the export of sheep and their products in addition to other economic losses. Although clinical signs are indicative of the disease, laboratory confirmation is necessary for unequivocal diagnosis and epidemiological study. The causative agent, sheep pox virus (SPV), is closely related antigenically and genetically to goat pox virus (GPV) and contagious lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), the other members of the genus capripox virus. In some countries, SPV and GPV are cross-infectious for small ruminants, which poses a problem in diagnosis and epidemiology. However, recent studies have shown that viruses are phylogenetically distinct and can be differentiated using molecular tools. Prophylaxis with attenuated vaccines is the control measure of choice since immunity is long-lasting. Detailed information on isolation, identification, pathology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and prophylaxis would not only help update the knowledge of the scientific fraternity, but will be helpful to policymakers in formulating appropriate measures for the control and eradication of the disease. illness. This synthesis aims to present an updated review of the disease and its control to provide the reader with an overview of the problem. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

179,Fluorogenic RT-PCR (TaqMan) Assay for the Detection and Classification of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus,"single-tube fluorogenic RT-PCR-based 'TaqMan' assay was developed for the detection and classification of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). TaqMan-PCR was optimized to quantify BVD virus using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System and dual-labelled fluorogenic probes. Two different gene-specific labeled fluorogenic probes for the 5” untranslated region (5” UTR) were used to differentiate between BVD types I and II. The sensitivity of the one-tube TaqMan assay was compared to the two-tube TaqMan assay and standard RT-PCR using 10-fold RNA dilutions. The one-tube TaqMan assay was 10 to 100-fold more sensitive than the two-tube TaqMan assay and the one-tube standardized RT-PCR. The specificity of the assay was evaluated by testing different strains of BVD virus and other bovine viruses. A total of 106 single or pooled positive and negative serum samples were tested for BVD, field strains, and reference strains. Quantification of BVD virus types I and II cRNA was performed using a standard curve plotting cycle threshold (CT) values versus copy number. The single-tube TaqMan-PCR assay was sensitive, specific, and rapid for the detection, quantification, and classification of BVD virus. © 2001 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Bhudevi, B.;Weinstock, D.",2001.0,,10.1016/s0378-1135(01)00390-x,0
180,"Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus H5N1 Clade 2.3.2.1c in Migratory Birds, 2014-2015","new Clade 2.3.2.1c H5N1 reassortant virus caused several outbreaks in wild birds in some regions of China from late 2014 to 2015. Based on genetic and phylogenetic analyses, the viruses possess a stable gene constellation with a Clade 2.3.2.1c HA, a PB2 gene derived from H9N2 and the other six genes of Asian H5N1 origin. Clade 2.3.2.1c H5N1 rearrangements showed a high genetic relationship to a human H5N1 strain (A/Alberta/01/2014). Further analysis showed that similar viruses have been circulating in wild birds in China, Russia, Dubai (West Asia), Bulgaria and Romania (Europe), as well as in domestic birds in some regions of Africa. Affected areas include the Central Asian, East Asian-Australasia, West Asian-East African, and Black Sea/Mediterranean flyways. These results show that the new Clade 2.3.2.1c reassortant viruses are circulating worldwide and may have gained a selective advantage in migratory birds, posing a serious threat to wild birds and potentially humans.

Analysis of nucleotide sequence variability and detection of distinctive patterns for overlapping genes suggested that ORFs 1 and 2 are likely functional. However, this was not the case for a putative third ORF, ORF3. Throughout the viral genome, several nucleotide or amino acid motifs have been identified that are conserved in circoviruses such as TT virus (TTV) and chicken anemia virus. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished three main groups of TLMVs and allowed the identification of putative recombination breakpoints in the untranslated region. TLMV genomes were detected by PCR in the plasma of 38/50 French blood donors tested and were also identified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, feces, and saliva. A phylogenetic study of 37 TLMV strains originating from France, Japan, and Brazil showed that the groupings were not related to geographic origin.",,"Biagini, P.;Gallian, P.;Attoui, H.;Touinssi, M.;Cantaloube, J.

These sequences are also compared with the partial G gene sequences of VSV IND type 2 (Cocal) and type 3 (Alagoas) viruses and the complete G gene sequences of the more distantly related VSV New Jersey (NJ) and Chandipura viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of G gene sequences by maximal parsimony revealed four main lineages or subtypes within classical VSV IND (type 1) viruses, each with a distinct geographic distribution. A high degree of VSV genetic diversity was found in Central America, with several virus subtypes of the VSV IND and NJ serotypes existing in this region of primarily enzootic diseases. Nineteen percent sequence variation, but no deletions or insertions, were evident within the 5' coding and noncoding regions of the VSV IND type 1 G genes. In addition to numerous base substitutions, the noncoding regions 3' of these viruses also contained numerous base insertions and deletions. This resulted in a striking variation in the size of G genes, with gene lengths ranging from 1,652 to 1,868 nucleotides. As the VSV IND type 1 subtypes have diverged from the common ancestor with the NJ subtypes, their G mRNAs have accumulated more 3' non-coding sequence insertions, up to 303 nucleotides in length. These consist mainly of an imprecise reiteration of the sequence UUUUAA, apparently generated by a single polymerase stutter error. Analysis of inferred amino acid sequence differences between VSV IND type 1 viruses revealed numerous substitutions within defined antigenic epitopes, suggesting that immune selection may play a role in the evolution of these viruses.",,"Bilsel, P.

186,Different genotypes of co-circulating nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis viruses in the chicken population in China,"Nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis (IB) of chicken was prevalent in most poultry farms in recent years, although the IB vaccination program has been widely carried out in China. To characterize the Chinese infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) S1 protein, five representative nephropathogenic IB viruses isolated from chickens in different provinces were genetically and phylogenetically analyzed. The results showed that the length of the S1 genes of the isolates was quite different (1617, 1620, 1623, 1629 and 1632 nucleotides, respectively). The nucleotide and amino acid homology among the five isolates was 76.7% ± 92.1% and 73.9% ± 89.5%, respectively, indicating a large variation in the S1 genes of the isolates. Variation in S1 genes could affect the antigenicity and pathogenicity of viruses. Genetically, point mutations, insertions and deletions can be observed in the S1 protein at many positions, especially in the first 150 amino acids at the N-terminus of the S1 protein. Two motif cleavage sites (RRXRR/S, HRRRR/S) were observed in all five strains sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that they belonged to different lineages. These findings indicated that different nephropathogenic IB virus genotypes were co-circulating in the chicken population in China. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Bing, G.

187,Enterovirus serotypes in patients with respiratory and central nervous system infections in Viet Nam 1997-2010,"BACKGROUND: Enteroviruses are the most common causative agents of human disease. Enteroviruses have recently been associated with regional and global epidemics, including severe disease (Enterovirus A71 and D68), and are of interest as emerging viruses. Here, we write Enterovirus AD (EV) of central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory infections in Vietnam. METHODS: Data and specimens from prospective observational clinical studies conducted between 1997 and 2010 were used. Species and serotypes were determined by type-specific RT-PCR and sequencing of viral protein 1 or 4 (VP1, VP4). RESULTS: Samples from patients with CNS infection (51 children - 10 CSF and 41 respiratory/rectal smears) and 28 adults (28 CSF) and respiratory infection (124 children - 124 respiratory smears) were analyzed. Twenty-six different serotypes of the four Enterovirus (AD) species were identified, including EV-A71 and EV-D68. Enterovirus B has been associated with viral meningitis in children and adults. Enterovirus A (EV-A71 and Coxsackievirus [CV] A10) associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease were detected in children with encephalitis. Various serotypes of the four Enterovirus species were found in respiratory samples, including 2 polioviruses, but also 8 CV-A24 and 8 EV-D68. With the exception of EV-D68, the relevance of these viruses in respiratory infection is still unknown. CONCLUSION: We described the diverse spectrum of enteroviruses from patients with respiratory and CNS infections in Viet Nam between 1997 and 2010. These data confirm the worldwide circulation of enterovirus genera and their associations and are important for clinical diagnosis, treatment of patients and outbreak response.",,"B'Krong, N.;Minh, N.

189,Variable and constant regions in African swine fever virus DNA,"SalI restriction pattern analysis of African swine fever virus DNA showed that SalI recognition sites did not change after more than 100 virus passages in porcine macrophages. The BA71V virus strain, obtained from the BA71 virus isolate by adaptation to grow in VERO cells, differed from the unadapted virus in two deletions with a length of 2.5 and 7 kb located near the ends of the DNA. A restriction analysis of several virus clones obtained from a naturally infected pig revealed length heterogeneity in both variable regions. A comparison of the SalI restriction maps of 23 field isolates of African swine fever virus (8 African, 11 European, and 4 American) has shown that the virus genome consists of a core region with a constant length of approximately 125 kb and two variable regions located near the ends of the DNA with a length of 38-47 kb for the left end of the DNA and 13-16 kb for the right end of the DNA. The total length of ASF virus DNA varied between 178 (BA71) and 189 (MOZ64) kb. The 23 African swine fever virus isolates were classified into five groups, according to the arrangement of SalI sites in the central region. Four groups contained only African isolates, while all European and American isolates belonged to the same group.

KOOLV was previously shown to be antigenically related to kotonkon virus, an ephemeral virus that has caused a short-lived fever-like illness in cattle in Nigeria, but YATV did not react antigenically with any other virus tested. Here we report the complete genome sequences of KOOLV (16,133 nt) and YATV (14,479 nt). Each has a complex genomic organization, with multiple genes, including a second nonstructural glycoprotein (GNS) gene and a viroporin (α1) gene, between the G and L genes, as is characteristic of ephemeroviruses. Based on an analysis of genome organization, sequence identity, and cross-neutralization, we show that both KOOLV and YATV should be classified as two new species of the genus Ephemerovirus.",,"Blasdell, K.

Microscopic findings consisted of acute multifocal meningoencephalitis, with neuronal degeneration and necrosis and gliosis. Viral isolation yielded non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Virus genotyping classified the virus as BVDV type 2. Immunohistochemical labeling for BVDV antigens with the BVD MAb clone 3.12F1 was prominent in the cytoplasm of neurons, glial cells, ependymal epithelium, perivascular macrophages, and cells. spindle cells, smooth muscle cells, and intravascular monocytes of the brain and brainstem. Laboratory results support that tissue alterations occurred as a result of BVDV type 2 infection. In the absence of other clinical signs related to BVDV infection and using the presented microscopic and laboratory evidence, we propose that BVDV type 2 isolated from this case may represent a neurovirulent strain of the virus.

Sequences encoding proteins distantly related to the replicase protein of single-stranded circular DNA viruses were identified. Inverse PCR was used to amplify and sequence multiple small circular DNA viral genomes. The viral genomes were related in genome size and organization to vertebrate circoviruses and plant geminiviruses, but with a different location for the stem-loop structure involved in rolling-circle DNA replication. The replicase genes of these viruses were more closely related to those of the circular DNA chromosomes of much smaller plant nanoviruses (~1 kb).

A panel of flavivirus-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were tested in blocking assays with serum samples from WNV-infected chickens and ravens. Selected MAbs were further tested against serum samples from birds representing 16 species and 10 families. Serum samples were collected from birds infected with WNV or Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and from uninfected control birds. Serum samples from SLEV-infected birds were included in these experiments because WNV and SLEV are closely related antigenically, maintain similar transmission cycles, and have overlapping geographic distributions. The ELISA using MAb 3.1112G potentially discriminated between WNV and SLEV infections, as all serum samples from WNV-infected birds and none from SLEV-infected birds were positive in this assay. Assays with MAbs 2B2 and 6B6C-1 readily detected serum antibodies in all birds infected with WNV and SLEV, respectively, and in most birds infected with the other virus. Two other MAbs partially discriminated between infections with these two viruses. Serum samples from most WNV-infected birds, but none of the SLEV-infected birds, were positive with MAb 3.67G, whereas almost all serum samples from SLEV-infected birds, but few from infected with WNV, were positive with MAb 6B5A-5.

197,Detection of a new porcine mouth-like virus in the context of post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome induced by porcine circovirus type 2,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) has been found to be the causative agent of post-weaning multi-system wasting syndrome (PMWS). However, PCV-2 is a ubiquitous virus in the pig population and most pigs infected with PCV-2 do not develop disease. Different factors such as age, maintenance, PCV-2 genetics, other pathogens, etc. have been suggested. to contribute to the development of PMWS. However, so far no proven connection has been found between any of these factors and the development of the disease. In this study, we explored the possible presence of other hitherto unknown DNA-containing infectious agents in lymph nodes collected from Swedish pigs with PMWS confirmed by random amplification and high-throughput sequencing. Although the vast majority of the amplified genetic sequences belonged to PCV-2, we also found genomic sequences of Torque Teno virus (TTV) and a new parvovirus. Detection of TTV was expected as, like PCV-2, TTV has been found to have a high prevalence in pigs worldwide. We were able to amplify a longer region of the parvovirus genome, consisting of the full NP1 and partial VP1/2. Through comparative analysis of nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic studies, we propose that it is a new porcine parvovirus, genetically related to bocaviruses. © 2009 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"BlomstrÃ¶m, A.

198,Viral metagenomic analysis shows the situation of co-infection in healthy and PMWS-affected pigs,"The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has enabled the possibility of investigating and characterizing the entire microbiome of individuals, providing a better understanding of the complex interaction between different microorganisms. This will help understand how the microbiome influences susceptibility to secondary agents and disease development. We have applied viral metagenomics to investigate the lymph node virome of Swedish pigs suffering from the multifactorial disease post-weaning multisystem wasting syndrome (PMWS), as well as healthy pigs. The goal is to increase knowledge of potential viruses, other than porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), involved in the development of PMWS, as well as to increase knowledge about the virome of healthy individuals. In healthy individuals, a diverse viral flora was observed with several different viruses present simultaneously. Most of the viruses identified were small linear and circular DNA viruses, such as different circoviruses, anelloviruses, and bocaviruses. In pigs suffering from PMWS, PCV2 sequences were detected, as expected, to a large extent, but other viruses were also identified in the background of PCV2. In addition to DNA viruses, RNA viruses were also identified, including a porcine pestivirus that showed close similarity to an atypical porcine pestivirus recently (in 2015) discovered in the US. Most of the viruses identified in the background of PCV2 in PMWS pigs could also be identified in healthy pigs. PCV2 sequences were also identified in healthy pigs, but to a much lesser extent than in PMWS-affected pigs. Although the method used here is not quantitative, the very clear difference in the amount of PCV2 sequences in PMWS-affected pigs and healthy pigs most likely reflects the very strong PCV2 replication known to be a hallmark of PMWS. Taken together, these findings illustrate that pigs appear to have a considerable viral flora consisting largely of small, circular, single-stranded DNA viruses. Future research on this type of virus will help to better understand the role these ubiquitous viruses may have in pig health and disease. We also demonstrated for the first time, in Europe, the presence of a new pig pestivirus.",,"BlomstrÃ¶m, A. L.;Fossum, C.;Wallgren, P.;Berg, M.",2016.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0166863,1
199,A metagenomic analysis shows the diverse microbial community of a vermicomposting system in Uganda,"Background: Vermicomposting is a mesophilic process that uses earthworms to efficiently and inexpensively process large volumes of organic waste. It has been suggested not only to increase soil fertility, but also to increase the biomass of beneficial bacteria while reducing harmful bacteria. The objective of this study was to establish a strategy to investigate and characterize the viral and bacterial composition of a vermicomposting system. Material and Methods: The vermicomposting unit used in this study was placed at the Makerere Kabanyolo University Agricultural Research Institute outside Kampala, Uganda, and fed 80% cattle manure and 20% livestock waste. food. On day 172, composting was completed and compost samples were collected from three layers of the unit: the top, middle, and bottom layers. A metagenomic approach was then applied to characterize the viral and bacterial composition of the vermicomposting system. Results and discussion: A high abundance and diversity of bacteria were identified. Proteobacteria were the largest phyla in the compost (mainly alpha, gamma, and betaproteobacteria), making up nearly 65% of the bacterial reads in the data sets. DNA samples of various possible pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Enterococcus spp. and Clostridium spp, were detected in the vermicompost, suggesting that harmful bacteria could still be present in the vermicast. Phages constituted the main viral group; Apart from phages, mainly insect viruses were identified. The only animal or human virus identified was the kobuvirus. In summary, metagenomic analysis proved to be an efficient technology to characterize the microbial composition of vermicast. The data from this study contributes to a better understanding of the microbes present in this type of composting system and can help determine the measures necessary for safe manure management.",,"BlomstrÃ¶m, A.

201,Viral metagenomic analysis of wild boar (Potamochoerus larvatus) in Uganda identifies new variants of porcine parvovirus 4 and Torque teno virus 1 and 2,"Background: As a result of rapidly growing human populations, the intensification of livestock production, and the increasing exploitation of wildlife habitats for animal agriculture, the interface between wildlife, livestock, and humans is expanding, with potential impacts on both human and domestic animal health. Wild animals serve as reservoirs for many viruses, which can occasionally lead to new infections of domestic animals and/or the human population. With this background in mind, we used metagenomics to investigate the presence of viral pathogens in sera collected from wild boar (Potamochoerus larvatus), a nocturnal species of wild Suido known to move between national parks and farmland in Uganda. Results: The 454 pyrosequencing application demonstrated the presence of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), a similar virus to hepatitis C GB and a similar virus associated with hypovirulence of Sclerotinia in sera from bushpigs. Virus-specific PCR assays combined with Sanger sequencing revealed two TTSuV-1 variants, one TTSuV-2 variant, and PPV4 in the serum samples, confirming the 454 sequencing findings. Conclusions: Using a viral metagenomic approach, we have performed an initial analysis of viruses present in wild boar sera and demonstrated for the first time the presence of PPV4 in a wild African suid. Furthermore, we identified new variants of TTSuV-1 and 2 in bushpigs. © 2012 Blomstrom et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"BlomstrÃ¶m, A. L.;StÃ¥hl, K.;Masembe, C.;Okoth, E.;Okurut, A.

202,Characterization of the virome of tonsils of conventional pigs and pigs free of specific pathogens,"Porcine respiratory disease is a multifactorial disease that can be influenced by various microorganisms, as well as non-infectious factors such as the handling and environment of the animals. In general, the interaction between different infectious agents is believed to play an important role when it comes to respiratory diseases. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterize the viral community of pig tonsil samples from a conventional herd with airway lesions at slaughter. In parallel, samples from pigs free of specific pathogens were also analysed. This study showed a variable coinfection rate in the different pigs. The differences were not observed at the group level but in individual pigs. Some viruses, such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses, could be found in most pigs, while others, such as various parvoviruses and anelloviruses, were only identified in a few pigs. In addition, the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained, as well as the complete genomes of two teschoviruses. The results of this study will help to elucidate which viruses circulate both in healthy pigs and in pigs associated with respiratory diseases.

203,Phylogenetic analysis of partial S1 and N gene sequences of infectious bronchitis virus isolates from Italy revealed genetic diversity and recombination.,"total of ten infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates collected from commercial chickens in Italy in 1999 were characterized by RT-PCR and sequencing of the S1 and N genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequences of the S1 gene showed that five field viruses clustered together with 793/B-type strains, with 91.3-98.5% nucleotide identity within the cluster, and one isolate had a very close sequence relationship (94.6% identity) with 624/ I make an effort. These two types of IBV have been previously identified in Italy. The other three isolated variants formed a new genotype recently detected in many Western European countries. For one of these variant viruses, Italy-02, which later became the prototype strain, the entire S1 gene was sequenced to confirm its originality. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of the most conserved partial N gene sequences, comprising 1 to 300 nucleotides, revealed a different clustering. Thus, three IBV variants of the novel Italy-02 genotype, which had 96.7-99.2% S1 gene nucleotide identity with each other, belonged to three separate subgroups based on N gene sequences. The type 624/I isolate Italy-06 together with Italy-03, which was undetectable with the S1 gene primers, shared 97.7% and 99.3% identity, respectively, in the N gene region with the H120 vaccine strain. Only one of the 793/B type isolates, Italy-10, clustered with the 793/B strain and shared 99.3% partial identity of the N gene, while the other four isolates were genetically distant from them (only 87.7-89.7% identity) and formed a separate homogeneous subgroup. The results demonstrated that both mutations and recombination events could contribute to the genetic diversity of the Italian isolates. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Bochkov, Y.

204,Basic research on the transmission of BSE to people,"Animal and human prion diseases belong to neurological diseases with amyloid deposition of the respective proteins. In prion disease, the cellular prionprotein is in its abnormal isoform(s) an essential component of the prionprotein aggregates found in the affected tissue. Unlike all neurodegenerative diseases such as Morbus Alzheimer or Huntington's disease, prion diseases are transmissible. Therefore, prion diseases were called Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs). The diseases have been well known for decades. Scrapie was first described around 1750, a case of BSE was reported in 1850, most likely a misdiagnosis, and human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) was described in 1920/1930. Transmission of CJD, i.e. Kuru, was suspected in the early 1950s and misclassified as slow virus disease. Transmission of CJD posed a problem to humans when transplants from CJD cases were used for treatment. Fortunately, these iatrogenic transmissions remained limited. But with the advent of BSE and the appearance of variant CJD cases in the UK and parts of Europe, scientists suspected that transmission from cattle to man might have occurred. From animal models we know of successful transmission through several routes. Species barriers do not completely prevent transmission. Rather, there may be transmission barriers that control individual susceptibility to prions. Modes of transmission, susceptibility to transmission, identification of receptor molecules, and molecular mechanisms of the transmission process are intensively investigated. Current knowledge allows us to assume that the non-apparent stages of prion infection claim a (non-existent) species barrier. This inapparent infection precedes overt disease, and therefore most research is focused on the development of highly sensitive assay systems for the detection of trace amounts of pathologic prion protein in suspected cases. The absence should also warn us against underestimating cases of BSE or vCJD in humans; currently 124 in Europe and one probable case in Hong Kong (March 7, 2002).

206,New viruses in birds: fly through the roof or do you need a cage? Check,"Emerging viral diseases continue to have a major global impact on humans and animals. In order to take appropriate action in the event of an emerging disease outbreak, rapid detection of the causative agent is a crucial first step. In this review, various aspects of virus discovery are discussed, with a special focus on recently discovered viruses in birds. New viruses with a large potential impact on domestic and wild bird species have been discovered in recent years using various virus discovery methods. Only a few studies report the detection of new viruses in endangered bird species, although a better understanding of the viruses circulating in these species is important. Additional studies focusing on the exact role of a new virus in disease and the impact of a new virus on bird populations are often lacking. Intense collaboration between different disciplines is needed to obtain useful information on the role of these new viruses.",,"Bodewes, R.",2018.0,3,,0

209,"Spatio-temporal analysis of the genetic diversity of influenza A(H10N7) viruses from seals, northwestern Europe","UNLABELED: Influenza A viruses are important pathogens for humans, domestic animals, and wildlife, and these viruses occasionally cross the species barrier. In spring 2014, increased mortality of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina), associated with influenza A(H10N7) virus infection, was reported from Sweden and Denmark. Within a few months, this virus spread to seals in the coastal waters of Germany and the Netherlands, killing thousands of animals. Genetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of this seal influenza A(H10N7) virus revealed that it was most closely related to several avian influenza A(H10N7) viruses. Collecting samples from infected seals during the course of the outbreak provided a unique opportunity to follow the adaptation of the avian virus to its new seal host. Sequence data from samples collected from 41 different seals from four different countries between April 2014 and January 2015 were obtained using Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing to describe the molecular epidemiology of influenza A(H10N7) virus. of the seals. Most of the sequence variation occurred in the HA gene, with some mutations corresponding to amino acid changes not found in H10 viruses isolated from Eurasian birds. Furthermore, sequence variation in the HA gene was greater at the beginning than at the end of the epidemic, when several of the previously observed mutations had been corrected. These results imply that when an avian influenza virus jumps the species barrier from birds to seals, amino acid changes in HA can occur rapidly and are important for adaptation of the virus to its new mammalian host. SIGNIFICANCE: Influenza A viruses are important pathogens for humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. In addition to ongoing circulation of influenza A viruses among various host species, interspecies transmission of influenza A viruses occasionally occurs. Wild waterfowl and shorebirds are the primary reservoir for most subtypes. of influenza A viruses, and the spread of influenza A viruses from birds to humans or other mammalian species can lead to major outbreaks. In the present study, various sequencing methods were used to elucidate the genetic changes that occurred after the introduction and subsequent spread of the avian influenza A(H10N7) virus among harbor seals in northwestern Europe using various samples collected during the outbreak. This detailed knowledge of the genetic changes required for the introduction and adaptation of avian influenza A viruses to mammalian hosts is important for rapid risk assessment of such viruses soon after crossing the species barrier.",,"Bodewes, R.;Zohari, S.;Krog, J.

Although in many agricultural settings food particles are the main component of these dusts, the inflammatory responses they elicit are likely due to particle-associated bacteria, archaebacteria, fungi and viruses. In this study, we performed DNA shotgun pyrosequencing metagenomic analyzes of dust from pig confinement facilities or grain elevators, with comparisons to dust from households without pets. DNA sequence alignment showed that 19% or 62% of shotgun pyrosequencing metagenomic DNA sequence reads from swine facilities or house dust, respectively, were of swine or human origin, respectively. In contrast, only 2% of such grain elevator dust readings were of mammalian origin. These shotgun metagenomic reads of mammalian origin were excluded from our analyzes of the agricultural dust microbiota. The ten most prevalent bacterial taxa identified in swine facilities compared to grain elevators or house dust were comprised of 75%, 16%, and 42% gram-positive organisms, respectively. Four of the top five dust genera from swine facilities were assignable (Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, and Eubacterium, with a relative abundance of 4% to 19%). The relative abundances of these four genera were lower in dust from grain silos or in households without pets. These analyzes also highlighted the prevalence of Firmicutes (70%) at the phylum level, Clostridia (44%) at the Class level, and Clostridiales at the Order level (41%) in the swine facility dust.

Sample population: 17 noncytopathic BVDV (NCP) from PI calves from 11 beef or dairy herds. Procedures: Viral RNA was extracted from infected cell cultures and BVDV-specific PCR primers were used to amplify >1000 bases of the viral genome. The derived sequences were used for molecular phylogenetic analyzes to determine viral genotype and viral genogroup and to assess genetic similarity between BVDVs. Results: Analysis of the 17 NCP strains of BVDV failed to detect a viral genotype or viral genogroup not yet reported to exist in the United States. One virus was classified as genotype 1, genogroup 1b, and 16 viruses were classified as genotype 2, genogroup 2a. Genotype 2 strains were genetically diverse, and genetic similarities were not obvious among viruses from geographic regions larger than a small location. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Viruses isolated from herds administered a BVDV genotype 1, genogroup 1a vaccine prior to breeding were primarily genetically diverse BVDV genotype 2, genogroup 2a. Vaccination with multiple BVDV genotypes may be necessary to improve protection. The methods used in this study to obtain and test field strains are applicable to evaluating the efficacy of current BVDV vaccines.

217,Unexpected diversity and expression of avian endogenous retroviruses,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) were identified and characterized in three avian genomes to better understand early retroviral evolution. Using the RetroTector software to detect relatively intact VREs, we identified 500 VREs in the chicken genome, 150 in the turkey genome, and 1,200 in the zebra finch genome. Previous studies suggested that endogenous alphatroviruses were present in chicken genomes. In this analysis, a small number of alphatroviruses were observed in the chicken and turkey genomes; however, these were largely outnumbered by beta-type, gamma-type, and alphabetic proviruses. While avian ERVs belonged to the same major groups as mammalian ERVs, they were more heterogeneous. In particular, beta-like viruses revealed an evolutionary continuum with the gradual acquisition and loss of betaretroviral markers and a transition from beta to alpha and then to alphatrovirus. Thus, it appears that birds may resemble a crucible for early VRE evolution. Many of the ERVs have integrated into clusters on chromosomes, often near the centromeres. About 25% of chicken ERVs were located in or near cellular transcription units; this is almost random. Most of these integrations were in the sense orientation in introns. A greater than random number of integrations was >100 kb from the closest gene. Deep sequencing studies of chick embryo fibroblasts revealed that about 20% of the 500 ERVs were transcribed and translated. A subset of these was also transcribed in vivo in chickens, showing tissue-specific expression patterns. SIGNIFICANCE Studies of avian endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) have given us insight into an earlier retroviral world. Three different classes of VRE were observed with many features of mammalian retroviruses as well as some important differences. Many avian VREs were transcribed and translated.",,"Bolisetty, M.;Blomberg, J.;Benachenhou, F.;Sperber, G.;Beemon, K.",2012.0,2016-10-01 00:00:00,,0

229,Comparative genome-wide analysis of chicken and turkey megriviruses (family picornaviridae): long 3' untranslated regions with a potential second open reading frame and evidence of possible recombination,"UNLABELED: Members of the Picornaviridae family consist of small positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) capable of infecting various species of vertebrates, including birds. One of the recently identified avian picornaviruses, with a remarkably long genome (>9040 nucleotides) but still incompletely sequenced, is turkey hepatitis virus 1 (THV-1; species Melegrivirus A, genus Megrivirus), a virus associated with necrosis liver and enteritis. in commercial turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo). This report presents the results of genetic analysis of three complete megrivirus genomes from chicken fecal samples (chicken/B21-CHV/2012/HUN, GenBank accession number KF961186, and chicken/CHK-IV-CHV/2013/ HUN, GenBank Accession No. KF961187) (Gallus gallus domesticus) and turkey (Turkey/B407-THV/2011/HUN, GenBank Accession No. KF961188) (Meleagris gallopavo) with the largest picornavirus genome ( up to 9739 nucleotides) described so far. The close phylogenetic relationship with THV-1 in the region of the genome encoding the non-structural protein and the possession of the same type of internal ribosomal entry site (similar to IVB) suggest that the study strains belong to the Megrivirus genus. However, genome comparisons revealed numerous unique variations (eg, different amounts of potential 2A peptides, unusually long 3' genome parts with various lengths of a potential second open reading frame, and multiple repetitive sequence motifs in the 3' untranslated region) and heterogeneous. sequence relationships between the structural and nonstructural regions of the genome. These differences suggest the classification of chicken megrivirus-like viruses in a new candidate species in the genus Megrivirus. Based on the different phylogenetic positions of the chicken megrivirus-like viruses in the structural and non-structural regions of the genome, the recombinant nature of these viruses is plausible. SIGNIFICANCE: Comparative analysis of the genome of the novel turkey and chicken megriviruses revealed numerous unique genomic features, for example, up to four potential 2A peptides, unusually long 3' genomic portions of various lengths containing a potential second open reading frame, multiple repetitive sequence motifs and heterogeneous sequence relationships (possibly due to a recombination event) between structural and non-structural regions of the genome.

In studies on the antigenic conservation of these sites, the four antigenic/genetic groups of SVDV described showed distinguishable patterns, confirming this classification. By sequencing mAb-resistant mutants, all five sites were precisely mapped and localized to a three-dimensional model of the SVDV capsid. All were found to be oriented, to a different extent, towards the outer surface of the capsid. Three of the five sites, located at VP1, VP2, and VP3, correspond to epitopes previously identified in historical isolates as sites 1, 2a, and 3b, respectively. Another site, site IV, which maps to position 258 of VP1, corresponds to a recently reported epitope and is described in this study as being specific for isolates of the most recent antigenic group of SVDV. A fifth site is described for the first time and corresponds to the single neutralization site that is common to both SVDV and coxsackievirus B5; it maps to positions 95 and 98 of VP1, but may also include nearby positions belonging to site 1 in the BC loop of VP1, suggesting site Ia classification. These results may have useful diagnostic and epidemiological applications, as mAbs to the new conserved site Ia provide universal reagents for SVDV detection systems, while the specificity of mAbs to site IV makes them unique markers for SVDV strains. latest from SVDV.",,"Borrego, B.;Carra, E.;GarcÃ­a-Ranea, J.

233,The role of viral population diversity in the adaptation of bovine coronavirus to new host environments,"The high mutation rate of RNA viruses allows a diverse genetic population of viral genotypes to exist within a single infected host. Genetic diversity in the host could better position the virus population to respond and adapt to a wide range of selective pressures, such as host-change events. Multiple novel coronaviruses, including SARS, have been identified in human samples in the last ten years, demonstrating the potential of coronaviruses as emerging human pathogens. Deep sequencing was used to characterize genomic changes in coronavirus quasispecies during simulated host switching. Three bovine nasal samples infected with bovine coronavirus were used to infect human and bovine lung and macrophage cell lines. The virus reproduced relatively well in macrophages, but lung cell lines were not infected efficiently enough to allow passage of unadapted samples to the laboratory. Approximately 12 kb of the genome was amplified before and after passage and sequenced with average coverages of nearly 950x (454 sequencing) and 38,000x (Illumina). The consensus sequence of many of the passed samples had a 12-nucleotide insert in the spike gene consensus sequence, and multiple point mutations were associated with the presence of the insert. Deep sequencing revealed that the insert was present but very rare in the bypassed samples and could rapidly change to dominate the population when placed in a different environment. The insert, encoding three arginine residues, occurred in a region associated with fusion entry into host cells and may allow infection of new cell types through heparin sulfate binding. Analysis of the deep sequencing data indicated that two distinct genotypes circulated at different levels of frequency in each sample and support the hypothesis that mutations present in past strains were ""selected"" from a pre-existing pool rather than through a de novo mutation and a subsequent population. fixation.",,"Borucki, M.

Although commercial vaccines against these viruses exist, the cost of implementing regular vaccination regimens against multiple diseases is prohibitive for most African farmers. Therefore, a single, affordable multivalent vaccine that simultaneously protects against all 5 diseases would be of great benefit to the livestock sector in Africa. It could also serve as a platform for the development of new vaccines of importance to other developing countries around the world. In this article, we present an overview of the economic importance of livestock in Africa, the pathogens responsible for RVF, PPR, SPP, GTP, and LSD, and the vaccination strategies currently used to combat them. We then review experience with the development of attenuated capripoxviruses as vaccines against LSD, SPP, and GTP and of recombinant capripoxvirus-vectored vaccines against RVF and PPR. We conclude the article by presenting the rationale for a single polyvalent capripoxvirus-vectored vaccine that would protect against all 5 cattle diseases and by describing the approach being taken by a consortium of Canadian and South African researchers to develop such a vaccine.

It has been divided into 4 main mammalian genotypes. In this study, 3 new complete genomes of porcine HEV were sequenced and the results did not reveal any particular host determinants compared to human isolates belonging to the same genotype. Nucleotide composition and codon usage bias were determined to characterize HEV host restriction and genome evolution. A peculiar nucleotide bias for nucleotides A and C was observed in all HEV genotypes. Other than the hypervariable region of ORF1 and the overlapping region of ORF2/3, no nucleotide bias was observed between the 3 codon positions. CpG dinucleotides were also shown to be underrepresented in HEV as in most RNA viruses. The effective number of codons used in the HEV genome was high, indicating a lack of codon bias. Correspondence analysis of relative synonymous codon usage was performed and showed that HEV evolution is not driven by host or geographic factors, but is representative of HEV phylogeny. These results confirm that the evolution of the HEV genome is mainly based on mutational pressure. Natural selection, involving, for example, fine-tuning of translation kinetics and escape from the host immune system, may also play a role in shaping the HEV genome, particularly in the ORF1 hypervariable region and the overlapping ORF2/3. These regions could be involved in host restriction.

The complete genomes of strain A/mallard/Netherlands/10-Nmkt/1999 and its porcine cell passaged descendant were analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing with depth of coverage ranging from several hundred to several thousand reads at any point. This allowed the characterization of defined minority subpopulations of gene segments 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 present in the original isolate. These minority subpopulations ranged from 9.5% (for segment 2) to 46% (for segment 4) of their respective gene segments in the parental stock. They were probably contributed by one or more viruses circulating within the same area, at the same time period, and in the same or sympatric host species. Minor subpopulations of segments 3, 4, and 5 became extinct after viral passage in porcine cells, while minor subpopulations of segments 2, 7, and 8 completely replaced their majority counterparts. The porcine cell passaged virus was thus a three-segment rearrangement and also harbored point mutations in segments 3 and 4. The passaged virus was more homogeneous than the parental stock, with only 17 minor single nucleotide polymorphisms present per above 5% frequency in the whole set. genome Although limited to one sample here, this deep sequencing approach highlights the evolutionary versatility of influenza viruses whereby they exploit their genetic diversity, predilection for mixed infection, and rearrangement to adapt to a new host environmental niche .",,"Bourret, V.;Croville, G.;Mariette, J.;Klopp, C.;Bouchez, O.;Tiley, L.;Guerin, J.

Molecular testing using a combination of reverse transcription (RT-) PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) indicated that astrovirus infection accounts for about a quarter of cases of viral encephalitis of unknown aetiology in cattle. However, whether these animals were infected by BoAstV CH13 or other astrovirus species remained to be explored. In the present study, we sequenced the complete astrovirus genome in brain tissues of eight bovines positive for RT-PCR and/or ISH. Phylogenetic comparison of genomic RNA and encoded structural and nonstructural proteins revealed that all of these astrovirus strains were highly similar to BoAstV CH13, as well as to a bovine encephalitis strain reported in the US (BoAstV NeuroS1), and clearly distinct from other previously reported astroviruses. The conserved 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) were predicted to show distinct secondary RNA structures, likely playing a role in viral RNA replication and/or protein translation. Based on these data, we propose that BoAstV CH13/NeuroS1 represents a new genotype species within the Mammastrovirus genus. The high degree of similarity between the strains and their relative distance to other genotype species suggest that during evolution some astroviruses acquired factors that specifically contribute to neuroinvasion.

241,Neurotropic astrovirus in cattle with non-suppurative encephalitis in Europe,"Encephalitis is a condition frequently diagnosed in cattle with neurological diseases. Many affected animals show a pattern of non-suppurative inflammatory reaction in the brain. Although this pattern supports a viral etiology, the causative pathogen remains unknown in a large proportion of cases. Using viral metagenomics, we identified an astrovirus (bovine astrovirus [BoAstV]-CH13) in the brain of a cow with nonsuppurative encephalitis. In addition, BoAstV RNA was detected by reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization in approximately a quarter (5/22 animals) of cattle with non-suppurative encephalitis of unknown etiology. Viral RNA was found mainly in neurons and at the site of pathology. These findings support the idea that BoAstV infection is a common cause of encephalitis in cattle. Phylogenetically, BoAstV-CH13 was closely related to rare astrovirus isolates from animal cases of encephalitis and one human patient. Future research should be directed toward the pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiology, and potential interspecies transmission of these neurotropic astroviruses.

243,viral metagenomics approach in a non-metagenomics experiment: extraction of pig DNA next-generation sequencing datasets identified several porcine parvoviruses for a retrospective evaluation of viral infections,"Shotgun next-generation sequencing (NGS) on whole DNA extracted from samples collected from mammals often yields reads that are not mapped (i.e., unmapped reads) in the host reference genome and are typically discarded as by-products. of the experiments. In this study, we extracted Ion Torrent reads obtained by sequencing DNA isolated from archived blood samples collected from 100 performance-tested Italian Large White pigs. Two reduced representation libraries were prepared from two DNA pools each constructed from 50 equimolar DNA samples. Bioinformatic analyzes were carried out to extract unmapped reads from the reference pig genome that were obtained from the two NGS data sets. In silico analyzes included sequence assembly and read mapping approaches for viral metagenomic analysis using the NCBI Viral Genome Resource. Our approach identified sequences that were consistent with several viruses of the Parvoviridae family: porcine parvovirus 2 (PPV2), PPV4, PPV5 and PPV6 and porcine bocavirus isolate 1-H18 (PBoV1-H18). The presence of these viruses was confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing of individual DNA samples. PPV2, PPV4, PPV5, PPV6, and PBoV1-H18 were identified in samples collected in 1998-2007, 1998-2000, 1997-2000, 1998-2004, and 2003, respectively. For most of these viruses (PPV4, PPV5, PPV6, and PBoV1-H18), previous studies reported their appearance much later (from 5 to more than 10 years) than our identification period and in different geographic areas. Our study provided a retrospective evaluation of apparently asymptomatic parvovirus-infected pigs, providing information that could be important in defining the occurrence and prevalence of different parvoviruses in southern Europe. This study demonstrated the potential of extracting NGS datasets not originally derived from metagenomics experiments for viral metagenomics analyzes in a cattle species.",,"Bovo, S.;Mazzoni, G.;Ribani, A.;Utzeri, V.

244,"Molecular characterization of menangle virus, a new paramyxovirus that infects pigs, fruit bats and humans","Menangle virus (MenV), isolated in August 1997 following an outbreak of reproductive disease in a New South Wales pigsty, is the second member of the previously unclassified family Paramyxoviridae to be identified in Australia since 1994. Similar to virus Hendra (HeV), MenV appears to be a virus of fruit bats (flying foxes) of the genus Pteropus. Serological cross-reactivity between MenV and other known paramyxoviruses was not detected and, to facilitate virus classification, a cDNA subtraction method was used to obtain virus-specific cDNA from MenV-infected cells. The cloning and sequencing of the products made it possible to determine the complete sequences of the NP, P/V, M, F and HN genes. Comparison of the deduced nucleotide and amino acid sequences for each gene with members of the Paramyxoviridae family, determination of the P-gene mRNA editing strategy, and phylogenetic analyzes confirmed that MenV is a new member of the Rubulavirus genus. However, the MenV HN deduced protein sequence exhibited only limited sequence homology compared to binding proteins from other paramyxoviruses. Key differences within amino acid residues considered to be important determinants of neuraminidase activity suggest that MenV HN is unlikely to possess the same degree of neuraminidase activity characteristic of other rubulavirus and respirovirus HN proteins. © 2001 Academic Press.",,"Bowden, T.

246,Analysis of the differential nuclear proteome of the host cell induced by attenuated and virulent hemorrhagic arenavirus infection,"Arenaviruses are important emerging pathogens and include a number of hemorrhagic fever viruses classified as NIAID category A priority pathogens and CDC potential biothreat agents. Infection of guinea pigs with the New World Arenavirus Pichindé virus (PICV) has been used as a biosafety level 2 model for Lassa virus. Despite ongoing research, little is known about the molecular basis of pathogenesis, and this has hampered the design of new antiviral therapies. Modulation of the host response is a potential strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases. We have previously investigated the global host response to attenuated and lethal arenavirus infections by using high-throughput immunoblotting and kinetic approaches. In this report, we describe the differential nuclear proteomes of a murine cell line induced by mock infection and infection with attenuated and lethal variants of PICV, investigated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Spot identification by tandem mass spectrometry revealed the involvement of several proteins that regulate inflammation through possible modulation of NF-κB activity and of several heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear proteins. Pathway analysis revealed a potential role for the transcription factor XBP-1, a transcription factor involved in major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) expression; differential DNA-binding activity was revealed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and differences in surface MHC-II expression were observed after PICV infection. These data are consistent with the results of several previous studies and highlight possible differences between transcriptional and translational regulation. This study provides a number of differentially expressed targets for future research and suggests that key events in pathogenesis may be established early in infection.

247,Genomic sequences of prototype Australian bluetongue virus serotypes reveal global relationships and potential routes of entry to Australia,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes (Culicoides spp.). It causes disease mainly in sheep and occasionally in cattle and other species. BTV has spread to northern Europe, causing disease in sheep and cattle. The introduction of new serotypes, changes in vector species and climate change have contributed to these changes. Ten serotypes of BTV have been isolated in Australia with no apparent associated disease. Simplified methods for preferential isolation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and template preparation enabled high-throughput sequencing of all 10 genome segments of all prototype Australian BTV serotypes. Phylogenetic analysis reinforced the previously characterized western and eastern topotypes but revealed unique features of several Australian BTVs. Many of the Australian BTV (Seg-) genome segments were closely related and clustered within the eastern topotypes. A new Australian topotype for Seg-5 (NS1) was identified, with taxa spread across several serotypes and over time. Seg-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -7, -9 and -10 of BTV_2_AUS_2008 were more closely related to related segments of Taiwan and Asia viruses and not to other Australian viruses, supporting the conclusion that BTV_2 entered Australia recently. The Australian prototype BTV_15_AUS_1982 was revealed to be unusual among Australian BTV isolates, with Seg-3 and -8 distantly related to other BTV sequences from all serotypes. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Boyle, D.

248,The evolution of human influenza A viruses from 1999 to 2006: a complete genome study,"Background: Knowledge about the complete genome constellation of seasonal influenza A viruses from different countries is valuable for monitoring and understanding the evolution and migration of strains. Few complete genome sequences of European influenza A viruses are currently publicly available, and there have been few longitudinal studies of the genome of human influenza A viruses. We studied the evolution of circulating H3N2, H1N1, and H1N2 human influenza A viruses from 1999 to 2006, analyzed 234 Danish human influenza A viruses, and characterized 24 complete genomes. Results: H3N2 was the prevalent strain in Denmark during the study period, but H1N1 dominated the 2000-2001 season. H1N2 viruses were first observed in Denmark in 2002-2003. After years of few genetic changes in H1N1 viruses, the 2005-2006 season featured more variable H1N1 than before. This indicates that H1N1 viruses are evolving and that H1N1 is likely to become the prevalent strain again soon. In general, the influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) of H3N2 viruses formed seasonal phylogenetic groups. Different lineages co-circulating within the same season were also observed. Evolution has been stochastic, influenced by small ""jumps"" in genetic distance rather than constant drift, especially with the introduction of the Fujian-like viruses in 2002-2003. Periods of evolutionary stasis were also observed that could indicate well-adapted viruses. The evolution of H3N2 viruses has also been influenced by gene rearrangements between lineages from different seasons. None of the influenza genes was influenced by strong positive selection pressure. The B antigenic site in H3N2 HA was the preferred site for genetic change during the study period, probably because the A site has been masked by glycosylations. Substitutions in CTL epitopes were observed in genes encoding neuraminidase (NA), polymerase acidic protein (PA), matrix protein 1 (M1), nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), and especially nucleoprotein ( NP). The pattern of N-linked glycosylation varied over the study period and H3N2 isolates from 2004 to 2006 were highly glycosylated with ten sequences predicted in HA, the most glycosylations observed in this study period. Conclusion: The present study is the first, to our knowledge, to characterize the evolution of the complete genomes of influenza A H3N2, H1N1, and H1N2 isolates from Europe over a seven-year period, from 1999 to 2006. have a more precise knowledge about the circulating strains. implications for predicting next season's strains and thus better matching vaccine composition.",,"Bragstad, K.;Nielsen, L.

249,Genomic Evolution of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) Isolates Revealed by Deep Sequencing,"Most studies on the evolution of PRRSV have been limited to a particular region of the viral genome. A full genome-wide understanding of the impact of different mechanisms in shaping PRRSV genetic diversity is still lacking. To do this, deep sequencing was used to obtain genomic sequences from a diverse set of 16 isolates from a region of Hong Kong with a complex epidemiological record of PRRSV. Genome assemblies and phylogenetic typing indicated co-circulation of strains of both genotypes (type 1 and type 2) with variable Nsp2 deletion patterns and distinct evolutionary lineages (""high fever"" type and local endemic type). Recombination analyzes revealed genomic breakpoints in structural and nonstructural regions of the genomes of both genotypes with evidence of many recombination events originating from common ancestors. Furthermore, the high fold coverage per nucleotide allowed the characterization of minor variants arising from the quasispecies of each strain. Overall, 0.56-2.83% of the sites were found to be polymorphic with respect to the cognate consensus genomes. The distribution of minor variants in each genome was not uniform, indicating the influence of selective forces. The proportion of variants capable of causing an amino acid change at their respective codons ranged from 25-67% and many were predicted to be harmless. Low-frequency deletion variants were also detected, providing a possible mechanism for their sudden appearance, as cited in previous reports.",,"Brar, M. S.;Shi, M.;Hui, R. K.;Leung, F.

250,Border disease in cattle,"Within the family Flaviviridae, viruses of the genus Pestivirus, such as border disease virus (BDV) of sheep, can cause large economic losses in farm animals. Originally, the taxonomic classification of pestiviruses was based on the host species from which they were isolated, but many pestiviruses are now known to exhibit broad species tropism. This review provides an overview of BDV infection in cattle. The clinical, hematologic, and pathologic anatomic findings in cattle that were transiently or persistently infected with BDV closely resemble those of cattle infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), closely related to pestivirus. Consequently, diagnosis of BDV infection can be challenging as it must be differentiated from various pestiviruses in cattle. The latter is very relevant in countries with control programs to eradicate BVDV in Bovidae, since in most circumstances, pestivirus infections in sheep, which act as a reservoir for BDV, are not included in the eradication scheme. Interspecies transmission of BDV between sheep and cattle occurs regularly, but BDV in cattle appears to be of minor general importance. However, BDV outbreaks at the farm or local level can be very costly.",,"Braun, U.;Hilbe, M.;Peterhans, E.;Schweizer, M.",2019.0,,10.1016/j.tvjl.2019.01.006,0

253,Shotgun Metagenomics of Biological Stains Using Ultra-Deep DNA Sequencing,"Detailed molecular analysis of blood or other biological stains at crime scenes is often hampered by the low quantity and quality of extractable DNA. However, determining the origin and composition of a stain is, in most cases, a prerequisite for the final clarification of a criminal case. Standard methodologies, for example DNA amplification followed by microsatellite typing or mitochondrial DNA sequencing, are often not sensitive enough to generate sufficient and conclusive data. We have applied ultra-deep DNA sequencing using 454 pyrosequencing technology on a whole genome amplified (WGA) environmental biological stain, which was unsuccessfully analyzed with standard methodologies following WGA. However, with the combination of WGA and 454 pyrosequencing, we were able to generate 7242 individual sequences with an average length of 195 bp. A total of 1,441,971 bp DNA sequences were generated and compared to public DNA sequence databases. Using RepeatMasker and the Basic Logical Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) against known microbial and mammalian genomes, it was possible to determine the metagenomic composition of the stain, i.e. 4.2% bacterial DNA, 0.3% bacterial DNA. viral DNA, 2.7% fungal DNA, 10.3% repetitive mammalian. DNA, 0.9% porcine DNA, 0.13% human DNA and 81.5% DNA of unknown origin.

255,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus nucleocapsid protein gene sequence determination confirms that this virus is a coronavirus related to human coronavirus 229E and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus,"The nucleotide sequence of the 1.7 kbp cDNA, which comprises the region closest to the 3' end of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) genome, has been independently determined for two European strains of PEDV. Nearly identical results were obtained for the two isolates, which were derived from cases of PEDV infection in Belgium and Great Britain in 1977 and 1987, respectively. The sequences contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1323 nucleotides (nt), which showed moderate identity with the nucleocapsid (N) gene of other coronaviruses. The greatest similarity at both the nucleic acid and protein levels was with human coronavirus 229E. However, the PEDV N gene was markedly larger than that of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis and human 229E viruses. This reflects the presence of a putative insertion of approximately 135 nt located towards the middle of the N gene. A second ORF of 336 nt, which could encode a leucine-rich protein similar to the internal protein of bovine coronavirus, but shorter, was found. within the PEDV N gene. Several RNA motifs typical of coronaviruses were also observed. These results confirm the previous provisional classification of PEDV as a coronavirus.",,"Bridgen, A.;Duarte, M.;Tobler, K.;Laude, H.;Ackermann, M.",1993.0,,,0

257,Revision of the global distribution of the virus from the affective fever from 2007 to 2014,"The foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus affects livestock throughout the world. There are seven different serotypes, each with a diversity of topotypes, genetic lineages, and strains. Some lineages have different properties that may contribute to sporadic spread beyond their recognized endemic areas. The objective of this study was to review the most significant FMD epidemiological events that took place worldwide between 2007 and 2014. The FMDV lineage O/Asia/Mya-98 virus caused serious epidemics in Japan and South Korea in 2010, both previously disease-free. In India, where FMD is endemic, the most important event was the resurgence of the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage in 2008. In particular, this lineage, normally restricted to India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, is also found in Saudi Arabia and Libya in 2013 and has caused several outbreaks in Tunisia and Algeria in 2014-2015. In January 2011, positive wild boars for FMD virus were found in Bulgaria, where the disease last occurred in 1996, followed by 12 outbreaks in cattle infected with FMD virus O/ME-SA/PanAsia2 . In 2012, FMDV SAT2 caused outbreaks in Egypt and the Palestinian Autonomous Territories. Another significant event was the appearance of FMDV Asia1 Sindh-08 in the Middle East. In South America, an outbreak of FMD serotype O, topotype Euro-SA was reported in 2011 in Paraguay, which was recognized as FMD-free with vaccination at that time. Lessons learned from past events point to the need for an integrated strategy comprising coordinated global and regional efforts for FMD virus control and surveillance. The specific local characteristics related to the host, the environment and the virus that condition the appearance of FMD must be carefully considered and incorporated to adapt the appropriate strategies to local plans. In this review, we compile relevant FMD epidemiological events to provide an overview of the current situation. We also discuss the current challenges present in different FMD areas.",,"Brito, B.

259,Non-maternal transmission is the main mode of transmission of ovine lentivirus in a flock of sheep: a molecular epidemiology study.,"Transmission of ovine progressive pneumonia virus (OPPV), a lentivirus of sheep, occurs through both maternal and non-maternal means. Currently, the contribution of each route to the overall prevalence of OPPV in the flock is poorly understood, as previous serological epidemiological studies lacked the ability to accurately trace transmission routes within an infected flock. In this study, the amount of maternal transmission of OPP in a naturally infected sheep flock was assessed by applying molecular analysis to proviral sequences derived from peripheral blood leukocytes of OPP-positive mother-daughter pairs (N=40). . Proviral envelope (env) and long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences, separately and combined, were used in the following 2 methods of sequence analysis: phylogenetic analysis and pairwise distance calculations. True maternal transmission events were defined as concordance in 2 of the 2 methods of sequence analysis. Using this criterion, the proviral env sequences resulted in a maternal transmission frequency of 14.3%, and the proviral LTR sequences resulted in a maternal transmission frequency of 10%. Both proportions of maternal transmission varied significantly from equality (P<0.0001). This indicates that the remaining 85.7-90% of daughters are infected through non-maternal transmission. This is also the first study to calculate the proviral rate of change of OPP for the env gene and the LTR promoter. Precise definition of OPPV transmission routes provides critical epidemiological data that supports management aimed at reducing flock transmission and viral dose. © 2010.",,"Broughton-Neiswanger, L.

H1N1 viruses from swine and birds can be divided into three groups: avian, classic swine, and 'bird-like' swine. Low or no reactivity of porcine 'bird-like' viruses in HI tests with monoclonal antibodies raised against classical porcine viruses was associated with amino acid substitutions within the hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic sites. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene revealed that classical swine viruses from European pigs are most similar to each other and closely related to swine strains from North America, whereas ""bird-like"" swine viruses are grouped with the swine viruses. avians The 'bird-like' viruses introduced to pigs in the UK in 1992 apparently originated directly from strains in pigs in mainland Europe at the time. The HA genes of the swine viruses examined had limited variation in antigenic sites and also contained fewer potential glycosylation sites compared to human H1N1 viruses. HA exhibited antigenic drift that was more marked in swine 'bird-like' viruses than in classical swine strains.

As the etiological agent of an important emerging veterinary disease, several studies have tried to explain its origin. However, several key questions remain, including the full biological ancestry of the virus and its geographical and temporal origin. Methodology: We sequenced near-complete genomes of 27 SVDV and 13 coxsackievirus B5 samples, all originally isolated between 1966 and 2006, and analyzed them alongside existing sequence and historical information. Results: Although analyzes incorporating an additional 24 near-complete SVDV genomic sequences indicate clear signs of recombination within SVDV, all 51 SVDV isolates remain monophyletic. This supports the hypothesis of a single anthroponotic origin of transference. Analysis of individual coding and non-coding regions supports that SVDV has a recombinant origin between coxsackievirus B5 and another serotype of Enterovirus B, most likely coxsackievirus A9. Extensive Bayesian sequence-based analysis of the time of the most recent common ancestor of all analyzed sequences places it within a few years around 1961. Epidemiological evidence points to China as the origin, but no samples are available to prove this conclusively. . Conclusions and Implications: Historical research and clinical aspects of the Enterovirus B serotypes involved make the current results consistent with a hypothesis that SVDV originated through coinfection, recombination, and a single anthroponotic event, during major epidemics of viral meningitis around 1960/1961 involving the ancestral serotypes. The exact geographical origin of SVDV may remain unprovable due to historical aspects.",,"Bruhn, C. A. W.;Abel Nielsen, S. C.;Samaniego, J. A.;Wadsworth, J.;Knowles, N. J.;Gilbert, M. T.

265,A genetic study of the interaction of the Piry virus with drosophila. II. Classification of viral agD mutants and some preliminary characterizations,"Piry virus mutants selected for their altered growth properties in Drosophila melanogaster have previously been designated agD mutants. This article presents a classification scheme to group some of these mutants and also presents the characteristics of some members of each group. Analysis, for each agD clone, of the mean incubation time at 20 °C relative to time at 28 °C (tÌ„20, tÌ„28), compared to the range of similar data for wild-type virus , allowed us to define 4 classes of agD mutants: (1) mutants equally affected at both temperatures, (2) cold-sensitive mutants in drosophila (csD), (3) heat-sensitive mutants in drosophila (tsD), and (4) mutants whose average incubation time could not be estimated at 20 or 28Â°C. All agD mutants are listed. Most of them were also ts in chick embryo cells (CECs), and some were classified into complementation groups. Some correlations were observed. For example, agD mutants that were ts+ in CEC were often (7 of 12) weakly sensitive to cold in drosophila. Those tsD mutants that were also ts in CEC all belonged to complementation group I (protein L). The true csD mutants, whose incubation time divergence with wt increased steadily, and who were also ts in CEC, all belonged to group I except one belonging to group V (protein G). Three mutants fell into a distinct subclass of csD mutants, characterized by a defect in the expression of CO2-sensitive symptoms below a defined temperature. One of these, which was further characterized, was shown to be in complementation group V. Some mutants of the fourth class were examined for fly invasion ability. This was found to be more or less strongly affected. Among these mutants, independently of this phenomenon, mutations were assigned to the L, N and G proteins, suggesting that different physiological defects are involved. A comparison of the drosophila phenotypes of some of the agD mutants with other members of the vesiculovirus family was made. The analogy of sigma rhabdovirus with tsD mutants is also reported.",,"Brun, G.",1991.0,,10.1016/0923-2516(91)90018-x,0

267,"Bovine herpesvirus 4 genome: Cloning, mapping and analysis of strain variation","The restriction map of the bovine herpesvirus 4 (BHV-4) genome (strain V. Test) was established for the restriction enzymes EcoRI, BamHI and HindIII by analysis of clones from a lambda library (Sau3AI partial digestion) and from a plasmid library (EcoRI fragments). One unit of the genome was defined as the length of the single central part, flanked at both ends by one of the terminal tandem repeats called polyrepetitive DNA (prDNA), and was estimated to be 113 ± 2 kbp. A restriction map of prDNA from strain V. Test showed 200 bp internal tandem repeats of different sequences. This region in the rDNA was highly polymorphic among BHV-4 strains, even in a viral DNA preparation of a plaque-purified strain. The right junction between the single and repeat genome sequence occurred at a nearly constant site, but the left junction contained a modified rDNA and was variable between BHV-4 strains. The central single part of the genome was very similar in the four strains considered, with some variations due to the presence or absence of a restriction site and four length variations were observed, located at positions 0.006 to 0.034 (far left), 0.211 to 0.225, 0.864 to 0.881, and 0.962 to 0.984 (far right).

268,The ancient evolutionary history of polyomaviruses,"Polyomaviruses are a family of DNA tumor viruses that are known to infect mammals and birds. To investigate the deeper evolutionary history of the family, we used a combination of viral metagenomics, bioinformatics, and structural modeling approaches to identify and characterize polyomavirus sequences associated with fish and arthropods. Analyzes based on the new divergent sequences indicate that polyomaviruses have been gradually co-evolving with their animal hosts for at least half a billion years. Phylogenetic analyzes of individual polyomavirus genes suggest that some modern polyomavirus species arose after ancient recombination events involving distantly related polyomavirus lineages. The improved evolutionary model provides a useful platform to develop a more accurate taxonomic classification system for the viral family Polyomaviridae.",,"Buck, C.

270,"Rift Valley fever seroprevalence and abortion frequency among cattle in Kisoro district, southwestern Uganda (2016): a prerequisite for zoonotic infection","Background: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is classified as viral hemorrhagic fever and is endemic in East and West Africa. RVF is caused by an arthropod-borne virus (RVFV); the disease is zoonotic and affects human and animal health, as well as international trade. In cattle it causes abortions, while human infection occurs through close contact with infected animals or animal products. Methods: A quantitative observational study using stratified sampling was conducted in the western region of Uganda. Blood samples and abortion events were collected and recorded from 1000 head of livestock (goats, sheep and cattle). Serum was tested for antibodies that react with RVFV IgG using a competitive ELISA test. Results: The global seroprevalence of FVRV was 10.4% (104/1000). Cattle had the highest seroprevalence (7%), followed by sheep (2.2%) and then goats (1.2%). Species-specific RVFV seroprevalence was highest in cattle (20.5%), followed by sheep (6.8%) and then goats (3.6%). RVFV seroprevalence in the northern highlands (21.8%) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than in the southern lowlands (3.7%). The overall prevalence of abortion was (17.4%), sheep had the highest abortion prevalence (7.8%), followed by goats (6.3%) and then cattle (3.3%). Species-specific abortion prevalence was highest in sheep (24.1%), followed by goats (18.8%) and then 9.7% in cattle. Conclusion: RVFV is endemic in Kisoro district and highland cattle are more likely to be exposed to RVFV infection compared to southern lowland cattle. Outbreak outbreaks in cattle are most likely to lead to zoonotic infection in Kisoro district.",,"Budasha, N. H.;Gonzalez, J. P.;Sebhatu, T. T.;Arnold, E.",2018.0,,10.1186/s12917-018-1596-8,0
271,Molecular analysis of Australian and New Zealand H7 avian influenza viruses: genetic diversity and relationships from 1976 to 2007,"Whole genome sequencing of 11 avian influenza A virus isolates from Australia and 1 from New Zealand (all subtype H7) has enabled the sequences of each of the genome segments to be compared with those of other avian influenza viruses. A of subtype H7. The inference of phylogenetic relationships for each segment has been used to develop a model of the natural history of these viruses in Australia. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin segment indicates that the Australian H7 isolates form a monophyletic clade. This pattern is consistent with long-term independent evolution which, in this case, is associated with geographic regions. Based on analysis of the other hemagglutinin H7 sequences, three other geographic regions were confirmed for which similar monophyletic clades have been observed. These regions are Eurasia plus Africa, North America, and South America. Analysis of neuraminidase sequences from the H7N1, H7N3, and H7N7 genomes revealed the same region-based relationships. This pattern of independent evolution of the Australian isolates is supported by the results of analysis of each of the remaining six genome segments. These results, together with the occurrence of five different neuraminidase subtype combinations (H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N6, H7N7) among the 11 Australian isolates, suggest that the maintenance hosts are almost exclusively associated with Australia. The single lineage of Australian hemagglutinin H7 sequences, despite the occurrence of multiple neuraminidase types, suggests the existence of a genetic pool from which a variety of rearrangements arise rather than the presence of a small number of stable viral clones. This pattern of evolution is likely to occur in each of the regions mentioned above.",,"Bulach, D.;Halpin, R.;Spiro, D.;Pomeroy, L.;Janies, D.;Boyle, D. B.",2010.0,Oct,,0

Since the HCV 3'-UTR has a unique structure among 3'-UTRs, we verified the possible communication between the HCV 5'- and 3'-UTR during translation using chimeric reporter RNAs.

This arises especially in data derived from modern high-throughput DNA sequencing, where errors can cause sequences to be incorrectly assigned to new taxa rather than matching existing observed taxa. We discuss a spectrum of methods to address this problem, focusing in particular on fitting a parametric mixture model and removing the highest diversity component; we also consider the data to be left-censored and to effectively pool two or more low-frequency counts. We find that these purely statistical ""top-down"" corrections will depend heavily on their underlying assumptions, but that such methods can be useful nonetheless.",,"Bunge, J.;BÃ¶hning, D.;Allen, H.;Foster, J.

274,Clinical and pathological characterization of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N8 in commercial turkeys in southern Indiana.,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a fatal systemic disease of poultry caused by various subtypes of influenza A virus and classified according to serological reactions to the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. In January 2016, a new HPAI-H7N8 subtype was diagnosed in a commercial flock of turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) in southern Indiana. Clinical signs and history included increased mortality, dyspnea, head tremors, recumbency, and drowsy or unconscious birds. Post-mortem examination of six recently dead birds showed red-stained mucus in the choana and trachea and marked pulmonary edema. Histologic lesions in the brain included severe multifocal lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalitis with foci of malacia, neuronal necrosis, and neuronophagia. All anatomical locations in the brain were affected, although histological changes in the cerebellum were considered mild. Other histologic lesions included pulmonary congestion and edema, splenic congestion and lymphoid depletion, fibrinoid necrosis of vessels within the spleen, and multifocal pancreatic acinar necrosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was weakly positive for influenza A in the brain; IHC was negative in other tissues tested. The clinical and pathological features of this case were consistent with previously published material on HPAI and add to the cases of known or suspected mutation from a low pathogenic virus to a highly pathogenic virus.",,"Burcham, G.

However, no specific bovine subgroup II adenovirus antigen was demonstrated in classical mastadenoviruses. Until now, serodiagnosis of bovine adenoviral infections has been severely hampered by not taking these facts into account, leading to a gross underestimation of the frequency of such infections.

279,Classification as equine herpesvirus separate from equine coital exanthema isolate 53/69,"During an outbreak of equine coital exanthema (ECE), a virus strain designated ECE 53/69 was isolated from a vaginal swab. He induced plaques, polykaryotic giant cells, and Cowdry type A nuclear inclusion bodies in equine cell cultures. ECE 53/69 replication was completely inhibited by IUDR. It was sensitive to ether, trypsin, heat and low pH. All of these features, as well as electron microscopic data described elsewhere, allowed classification of the strain as a herpesvirus. That it was an equine herpesvirus was confirmed by natural and experimental infections in horses and by replication that occurred exclusively in equine cell cultures. Equine cytomegaloviruses also replicate only in equine cells. They do so, however, at a much slower rate and remain cell-bound. ECE 53/69, on the other hand, causes a very fast cpe and is released at high titers in the tc medium. Equine rhinopneumonitis virus differs from ECE by replicating in a broad spectrum of heterologous cells as well as by the lack of cross-neutralization, cross-complement fixation, and different clinical manifestations.

283,Influenza A virus subtypes in wild birds from northeastern Spain (Catalonia),"Since the spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus in 2005, many surveillance programs have been initiated in poultry and wild birds around the world. This study describes for the first time the detection of different avian influenza virus (AIV) subtypes in wild birds in the western Mediterranean area (Catalonia, northeastern Spain). Over a 3-year period (mid-2006 to mid-2009), 1374 birds from 16 different families were examined and a total of 62 AIVs were detected by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay. AIVs were most frequently detected in the families Anatidae, Phoenicopteridae, Rallidae, and Laridae. Of the 62 positive samples, 28 AIV could be isolated from embryonated eggs. All isolates were subtyped by hemagglutinin and neuraminidase inhibition techniques and 10 different hemagglutinins (HA) and 7 neuraminidases (NA) were found in 13 different subtype combinations. The most common combinations were H4N6 (22.2%) and H1N1 (18.5%). HA and NA gene sequences of different AIV subtypes were compared and aligned with AIV strains available in genome databases. Our studies on the phylogenetic analysis of AIV revealed that all sequenced AIV genes from wild birds in northeastern Spain clustered within Eurasian bird clades, including H8, N4, and N5 gene sequences analyzed for the first time in Europe.

After a brief introduction on the subject , the negative results obtained by the author on inhibitors are discussed. Next, the peculiarities of the three tested procedures, based on the determination of NADH as a measure of silaidase activity, are discussed. The spectrofluorometric measurement of NADH concentration is a more sensitive and convenient procedure than spectrophotometry, although it is less sensitive than that based on bioluminescence. Sialidase activity is generally higher in type A than in type B influenza viruses; however, some differences have been found between the three A subtypes analyzed. In addition, the thermal stability and stability against changes in pH values are higher for influenza viruses from ducks, followed by humans and, finally, influenza from pigs. Influenza type C virus O-acetyl terase shows broad specificity; it acts on O-acetyl-containing compounds that may not be sialic acids. It seems that this enzyme could contribute to facilitating the sialidase action of type A and B influenza viruses. The peculiarities of type C influenza virus suggest including this type as a new genus in the future classification of viruses.",,"Cabezas, J. A.",1991.0,,,0

It is transmitted to humans mainly through the bite of domestic or wild animals infected with the virus. This article shows the circulation of this virus in non-hematophagous bats in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Methods: A survey was conducted on the number of bats that had been sent for diagnosis by the Department of Virology of the Municipal Institute of Veterinary Medicine Jorge Vaitsman and were positive for rabies. The positive animals were identified and the isolated viruses were sent for antigenic typing with indirect immunofluorescence. The results were compared with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention antigen panel. Results: During 2001-2010, the laboratory received 555 non-hematophagous bats for rabies diagnosis, of which 198 (35.7%) were from the city of Rio de Janeiro.

During 2010-2013, a total of 21,832 clinical samples were examined for EV and the detection frequency was 6.5% (1,430). Of the total EV-negative samples, only 1,873 samples from 2011 to 2013 were available for HPeV testing. HPeV was detected in 42 (2%) of them. Positive samples were genotyped by PCR and sequencing. EV infections occurred in all patient age groups: neonates (17%), children 28 days to 2 years (29%), children 2 to 14 years (40%), and adults (14%). Thirty-four different types of electric vehicles were identified. HPeV infections were detected exclusively in infants <8 mo (70% of neonates, P < 0.05). All but one HPeV were HPeV-3. Differences were found in the detection of type frequency according to age and clinical manifestation. Coxsackievirus (CV)-B4 (61%), CV-B5 (83%), and HPeV-3 (64%) were more common in neonates than in older patients (P < 0.05).

287,"Molecular evolution of H1N1 swine influenza in Guangdong, China, 2016-2017","Pigs are the main host of the H1N1 swine influenza virus (SIV); however, H1N1 can also infect humans and occasionally cause severe respiratory illness. To track the evolution of SIV in Guangdong, China, we conducted an epidemic investigation during the period of 2016-2017. Nine H1N1 influenza viruses were isolated from porcine nasal swabs. Antigenic analysis revealed that these viruses belonged to two distinct antigenic groups, represented by A/Swine/Guangdong/101/2016 and A/Swine/Guangdong/52/2017. In addition, through phylogenetic analysis, three genotypes were identified, known as GD52/17-like, GD493/17-like and GD101/16-like. Importantly, genotypes including minimal internal genes of 4 pdm/09 origin have become predominant in China in recent years. A total of 2966 pig serum samples were used to perform hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests, and the results showed that the seroprevalence values of SW/GD/101/16 (32.2% in 2016, 32.1 % in 2017) were significantly higher than the seroprevalence values of SW/GD/52/17 (18.0% in 2016, 16.7% in 2017). Our study showed that the three rearranged genotypes of H1N1 SIV currently circulating in China are stable, but H1N1pdm09 poses human health challenges by introducing internal genes into these rearranged genotypes.

Phylogenetic analysis using all six genes provides a high-resolution profile for genotype designation as genotype I for strains D3 and R8 and genotype VI for strains W4 and P4. Furthermore, molecular dating based on different genes suggests that D3 and R8 split from their common ancestor around 1998; W4 and P4 diverged from their common ancestor around 1999.

289,Identification and analysis of microRNAs differentially expressed in PK-15 cells infected with Japanese encephalitis virus with deep sequencing,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne Flavivirus, causes acute viral encephalitis with high morbidity and mortality in humans and animals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are important modulators of the intricate host-pathogen interaction networks. However, our knowledge of the changes that occur in miRNAs in host cells after JEV infection is still limited. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of JEV at the level of post-transcriptional regulation, we used Illumina deep sequencing to sequence two small RNA libraries prepared from PK-15 cells before and after JEV infection. We identified 522 and 427 miRNAs in the infected and uninfected cells, respectively. Overall, 132 miRNAs were expressed significantly differently after JEV challenge: 78 were upregulated and 54 downregulated. The sequencing results of the selected miRNAs were confirmed with RT-qPCR. GO analysis of host target genes revealed that these dysregulated miRNAs are involved in complex cellular pathways, including the metabolic pathway, inflammatory response, and immune response. To our knowledge, this is the first report of comparative miRNA expression in PK-15 cells after JEV infection. Our findings will support further studies on the roles of miRNAs in JEV replication and identify potential candidates for JEV antiviral therapies.",,"Cai, Y.;Zhu, L.;Zhou, Y.;Liu, X.;Liu, X.;Li, X.;Lang, Q.;Qiao, X.;Xu, Z.",2015.0,2020-01-01 00:00:00,,0

291,SYMPOSIUM ON RUMIN NUTRITION: Tiny but mighty: the role of rumen microbes in livestock production,"Rumen-dwelling microbes convert low-quality fibrous plant material into usable energy for the ruminant host. Composed of bacteria, protozoa, fungi, archaea, and viruses, the rumen microbiome composes a sophisticated network of symbiosis essential for the maintenance, immune function, and overall production efficiency of the ruminant host. Robert Hungate laid the groundwork for ruminal microbiome research. This area of research has expanded immensely with advances in methodology and technology that have not only improved the ability to describe microbes in taxonomic and density terms, but also to characterize microbial populations, their functions, and their interactions with each other and with the host. The interaction between the rumen microbiome and the host contributes to the variation of many phenotypic traits expressed by the host animal. A better understanding of how the rumen microbiome influences host health and performance may lead to new strategies and treatments to improve traits. Furthermore, elucidation of maternal, genetic, and environmental factors that influence the establishment and development of the rumen microbiome may provide new insights into potential mechanisms for manipulating rumen microbial composition to improve long-term host health and performance. . The potential for these small but powerful rumen microbes to play a role in improving livestock production is appreciated despite being relatively obscure.",,"Cammack, K. M.;Austin, K.

294,Lambda display phage as a mucosal vaccine delivery vehicle for peptide antigens,"Bacteriophages are structurally stable in the gastrointestinal tract and have favorable features of safety, stability, ease of production, and immunogenicity. These attributes make them potential candidates as oral vaccine delivery vehicles, but little is known about their ability to induce mucosal immune responses in the small intestine. Whole-body imaging of mice confirmed that bacteriophage lambda (LP) was distributed throughout the gastrointestinal tract 24 h after oral administration. In newborn calves, targeted administration of LPs into the small intestine confirmed that LPs were immunogenic in a dose-dependent manner and were taken up by Peyer's patches. LP-specific IgA responses were induced in both Peyer's patches and draining mesenteric lymph nodes. A lambda display phage (LDP) was constructed to display three immunogenic disease-specific epitopes (DSE) of cervid prion protein (amino acids 130-140 [YML]; 163-170 [YRR]; and 171-178[YRR]. ]) fused to phage capsid head protein D (LDP-DSE). Targeted delivery of purified LDP-DSE to intestinal segments induced IgA responses to all three peptide epitopes. Furthermore, administration of bacteria expressing soluble D-DSE also induced epitope-specific IgA responses in targeted Peyer's patches. These are the first studies to report the use of LDP to induce epitope-specific IgA responses in the small intestine and confirm that Peyer's patches function as a site for LP uptake. Furthermore, IgA responses to peptide epitopes were observed in LDP in the absence of a mucosal adjuvant. These observations confirm that LDP has the ability to function as a mucosal delivery vehicle with protein D as an efficient vehicle for peptide epitopes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

295,Two new parvoviruses in New and Old World fruit bats,"Bats, a globally distributed group of mammals with great ecological importance, are increasingly recognized as natural reservoirs of viral agents of importance to human and animal health. In the present study, we evaluated pools of blood samples obtained from two phylogenetically distant families of bats, in particular from flying foxes (Pteropodidae), Eidolon helvum in West Africa, and from two species of New World leaf-nosed fruit bats ( Phyllostomidae), Artibeus jamaicensis and Artibeus lituratus in Central America. A sequence-independent virus discovery technique (VIDISCA) was used in combination with high-throughput sequencing to detect two new parvoviruses: a PARV4-like virus called Eh-BtPV-1 in Eidolon helvum from Ghana and the first member of a new putative genus in Artibeus jamaicensis from Panama (Aj-BtPV-1). These viruses circulated in the corresponding bat colony at rates of 7-8%. Aj-BtPV-1 was also found in Artibeus lituratus (5.5%). Both viruses were detected in the blood of infected animals at high concentrations: up to 10E8 and 10E10 copies/ml for Aj-BtPV-1 and Eh-BtPV-1, respectively. Furthermore, Eh-BtPV-1 was detected in all organs collected from bats (brain, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and intestine), with the spleen and kidneys identified as the most likely sites where viral replication takes place. Our study shows that bat parvoviruses share common ancestors with known human and cattle parvoviruses. We also provide evidence that a variety of Parvovirinae are capable of causing active infection in bats and that they are widely distributed in these animals with different geographic origins, ecologies, and climatic ranges. © 2011 Canuti et al.",,"Canuti, M.;Eis-Huebinger, A.

296,Swine flu outbreak in Argentina reveals non-contemporary human virus H3N2 highly transmissible between pigs,"Sporadic outbreaks of human influenza A H3N2 virus (IAV) infections have been reported in pig populations in Asia, Europe, and North America since 1970. In South America, serological surveys in pigs indicate that IAVs of subtypes H3 and H1 are currently in circulation; however, virus isolation and characterization have not been reported. In November 2008, an outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs consistent with swine influenza virus (SIV) infection was detected in Argentina. The current study describes the clinical epidemiology, pathology, and molecular and biological characteristics of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolated virus shared 96-98% nucleotide identities with H3N2 IAVs that circulated in humans between 2000 and 2003. Antigenically, sera from experimentally inoculated animals cross-reacted primarily with H3N2 influenza viruses of IAV origin. non-contemporary human. In an experimental infection in a commercial pig breed, the virus was of low virulence but was efficiently transmitted to contact pigs and caused severe disease when an infected animal acquired a secondary bacterial infection. This is the first report of a fully human H3N2 IAV associated with clinical disease in pigs in South America. These studies highlight the importance of bidirectional transmission of IAV and SIV between pigs and humans, and call for increased surveillance of influenza in the pig population worldwide. © 2011 SGM.",,"Cappuccio, J.

It affected industrially raised poultry, dealer flocks, and backyard flocks, with a total of 254 outbreaks reported as of December 31, 2000. Virological investigations yielded virulent isolates of Newcastle disease virus, producing pathogenicity indices intracerebral ranging between 1-6 and 2-0. and that, based on their binding patterns to monoclonal antibodies, they could be classified as belonging to group C1. Clinical, macroscopic, and microscopic findings were typical of Newcastle disease, and different bird species were susceptible to different degrees. Chickens and guinea fowl appear to be the most susceptible, followed by pheasants, turkeys, and ostriches. The epidemiological investigation highlighted the crucial role of a broiler farm in starting the epidemic and of traffickers in its perpetuation.

Virus-induced virulence is generally quantified by measuring the mean time to death or onset of symptoms after viral inoculation. In this review we make a distinction between general virulence and neurovirulence. We define neurovirulence as the degree of pathogenesis in the nervous system, but we intend this to encompass more than just the ability of the virus to grow in the central nervous system (CNS). This distinction is made possible by recent advances that allow an integrated assessment of the degree of pathology, reactive gliosis, and inflammatory response to infection in the intact organism with specific antisera and molecular probes.",,"Card, J.

301,Virological and phylogenetic characterization of attenuated small ruminant lentivirus isolates that elude efficient serological detection,"Three small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) field isolates were obtained from a mixed herd of goats and sheep certified for many years free from caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV). Phylogenetic analysis of the pol sequences allowed these isolates to be classified as subtype A4. None of the animals showed clinical signs of SRLV infection, confirming previous observations that suggested that this particular subtype is highly attenuated, at least for goats. A real-time quantitative PCR strategy based on primers and probes derived from a highly variable env region allowed us to classify animals as uninfected, single or double infected. The performance of different serological tools based on this classification revealed their profound inadequacy in monitoring animals infected with this particular subtype of SRLV. In vitro, the isolates showed differences in their cytopathicity and a tendency to replicate more efficiently in goat cells than in sheep cells, especially in goat macrophages. In contrast, in vivo, these viruses achieved significantly higher viral loads in sheep than in goats. Both env subtypes infected goats and sheep with equal efficacy. One of these, however, achieved significantly higher viral loads in both species. In conclusion, we characterized three isolates of the SRLV A4 subtype that circulate efficiently in a mixed herd of goats and sheep despite their apparent attenuation and strict physical separation between goats and sheep. The poor performance of applied serological tools indicates that, to support an SRLV eradication campaign, it is imperative to develop new subtype-specific tools. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",,"Cardinaux, L.;Zahno, M.

An unusual outbreak of skin disease in fattening calves in southern Brazil is described. Fourteen of 17 male cattle (82%), 6 to 48 months of age, that fed on grasses were affected. The animals developed papules, vesicles, and crusted proliferative lesions on the snout in a clinical course of approximately 10-15 days. Crusty lesions often present with oozing and bleeding. Histological examination of mucocutaneous tissue in loosened crusts revealed acanthosis with thickening of the corneal layer and premature keratinization (parakeratotic hyperkeratosis). The dermis presented multifocal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. Electron microscopic examination of scab samples revealed typical parapoxvirus particles: oval in shape (260 nm × 160 nm), enveloped, and covered with a helical shell. Polymerase chain reaction using a pan-parapoxvirus primer set for the B2L gene amplified a 590 bp product from DNA extracted from scabs.

It is one of the earliest described members of the Orthopoxvirus genus, which includes the viruses that cause smallpox and monkeypox in humans. Both historical and current literature describe ""cowpox"" as a disease with a single etiologic agent. The genotypic data presented in this paper indicate that CPXV is not a single species, but rather a composite of several (up to 5) species that can infect cattle, humans, and other animals. The practice of naming agents after the host in which the resulting disease manifests obfuscates the true taxonomic relationships of ""cowpox"" isolates. These data support the elevation of up to four new species within the traditional ""cowpox"" group and suggest that both wild and modern vaccine strains of Vaccinia virus are more closely related to CPXV from continental Europe than to the UK. the country of the vaccine.",,"Carroll, D.

307,Vaccinia and other viruses with available vaccines show marked homology to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein: the prospect of using existing vaccines to stop the AIDS pandemic,"Cross-reactive immunity occurs when infection or vaccination against one virus protects against another related family member. A homologue search of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein revealed that it is composed of thousands of interspersed and overlapping pentapeptide viral matches or consensuses with longer gaps, belonging to more than 70% of the currently sequenced virome, infecting all the kingdoms, from bacteria to man. It was also highly homologous to proteins from Visna/Maedi and other sheep viruses, while other proteins (nef/tat/gag/pol) were homologous to proteins from equine infectious anemia virus and HTLV-2/HTLV-2 viruses. 3. This phenomenon suggests that horizontal gene transfer from coinfecting RNA and DNA viruses to retroviruses is extensive, providing a pathway for subsequent insertion of non-retroviral genes into human and other genomes by retroviral integration. This homology includes all viruses for which vaccines already exist. Cross-reactive immunity may be operative in AIDS, since the Vaccinia vaccine decreases viral replication in the cells of patients infected with HIV-1, for the tropic form CCR5. Infections with measles, dengue virus or GB virus C also decrease the viral load of HIV-1. The resumption of smallpox/Vaccinia vaccination can be expected to have a significant effect on the AIDS pandemic, and careful study of the potential uses of other existing viral and bacterial vaccines deserves special attention. This phenomenon may also be relevant for other recalcitrant viruses, bacteria and parasites for which there is no vaccine and the arsenal of existing vaccines may have a role to play in diseases other than those for which they were designed. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",,"Carter, C.

The presence of viral RNA in human and swine samples was also evaluated, and phylogenetic analysis was performed on HEV-positive samples. Forty-two pig farms were sampled; 142 workers were enrolled in the study and classified into two groups: (i) 69 workers with occupational contact with pigs (including veterinarians and farmers) recruited from the 42 sampled farms; (ii) 73 without occupational contact with pigs. Forty-one of 42 (97%) pig farms were enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay positive for HEV antibodies (Abs). The overall seroprevalence in pigs was 50% (441/879), with a higher seropositivity rate in sows (333/469, 71%). HEV RNA was detected in fecal samples in animals from 13 of 42 farms tested (31%), with higher positivity resulting in weanlings (40/246, 16.3%). Phylogenetic analysis classified all HEV isolates within genotype 3 (subtypes 3f, 3e, 3c). All humans were negative for HEV viral genome in blood. Five of 142 sera were positive for IgG anti-HEV with an overall prevalence of 3.52% with no statistically significant difference in prevalence rates between workers at zoonotic risk and the control group (5.7% vs. 1.3% ). In contrast, a significant difference (OR 10.1) was observed within the subgroup that included subjects exposed for short periods (veterinarians) compared to those who worked for long periods (farmers), suggesting a correlation between exposure and the probability of HEV infection.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that one sample showed similarity with a sequence from the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) (So-TTV2) and with one from the douroucoulis (Aotes trivirgatus) (At-TTV3). Two samples showed similarity to a human Torque Teno Mini Virus (TLMV). The other sample clustered with a chimpanzee sequence (Pt-TTV6) and with the human TTV strain TA278. All chicken plasma samples tested were negative.

312,Circulation of human hepatitis E virus in Bulgaria: deep Bayesian phylogenetic analysis for the control of viral spread in the country,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in Bulgaria is endemic, as evidenced by the seroprevalence of antibodies against the virus in the general population and the high prevalence of recorded clinical cases. In this study, a deep Bayesian phylogenetic analysis has been performed to provide insights into the genetic diversity and spread of HEV genotypes in Bulgaria. Three different HEV virus datasets were constructed for genotyping using the maximum likelihood method, for evolutionary rate estimated using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, for demographic history investigation, and for selective pressure analysis. The evolutionary rate for genotype 3e was 351 × 10âˆ'3 substitutions/site/year (95% highest posterior density [95% HPD]: 145 × 10 âˆ'3-575 × 10 âˆ'3). The root of the time to the most recent common ancestor of the maximum Bayesian clade credibility tree of the HEV 3e genotype corresponded to 1965 (HPD 95% 1949-1994). The Bulgarian sequences were mainly grouped into the main clade (clade A). The monophyletic clade included all sequences of the Bulgarian 3e genotype. The demographic history showed a slight growth from 1995 to 2000, followed by something of a bottleneck in the 2010s, a peak in 2011, and a new growth in 2015. Selection pressure analysis showed no sites under positive pressure, but 64 statistically significant sites under negative selection. . Molecular epidemiological surveillance by Bayesian phylogeny of the HEV virus can contribute to trace the form of human infection after contact with the pig source directly or heating the meat, improving public health control.",,"Cella, E.;Golkocheva-Markova, E.;Sagnelli, C.;Scolamacchia, V.;Bruni, R.;Villano, U.;Ciccaglione, A.

313,First report of cowpea mild mottle virus in chia (Salvia hispanica),"Chia (Salvia hispanica), a herbaceous plant of the Lamiaceae family, has gained popularity due to its high concentrations of beneficial Omega-3 fatty acids for health. Plants showing different virus-like symptoms were observed in the main chia-producing areas of Argentina. Some plants had yellowish, mottled and blistered leaves, and others had shortened internodes and deformed leaves and stems. The objective of this study was to identify the viruses that infect this crop. Forty symptomatic chia plants were collected from nine production fields in northeastern Argentina. Samples were analyzed for alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), cowpea mild mottle virus (CPMMV), cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), and group tospovirus (I, II and III) by DAS-ELISA, for the genera Potyvirus by PTA-ELISA and for Begomovirus by PCR. CPMMV was detected in three plants with different types of symptoms. In these plants, feather-like inclusions formed by virions were observed with transmission electron microscopy. ORF2 to ORF6 (2462 nucleotides) of the CPMMV viral genome was amplified by RT-PCR. The nucleotide sequence (nt) of the coat protein gene (CP-ORF5) of the chia virus isolate was obtained and compared with 31 CPMMV sequences reported in GenBank. The results showed between 75.5% and 99.0% nt identity, which is above the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses criteria for Carlavirus species differentiation. Phylogenetic analysis with the nt sequences of the CP gene revealed that the CPMMV chia isolate clustered with other CPMMV isolates from other plant species from Brazil, Ghana, India, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, and the USA, but separated from other CPMMV isolates. four from India. This is the first report of the presence of CPMMV in chia in the world. Although the other viruses were not detected in this work, it is possible that the different symptoms observed could be produced by a mixture of viruses since CPMMV was found in chia plants with different symptoms.

314,Ordering taxa in phylogenetic trees using evolutionary algorithms,"BACKGROUND: In a typical ""left to right"" phylogenetic tree, the vertical order of taxa is meaningless, as only the branching path between them reflects their degree of similarity. To make unresolved trees more informative, here we propose an innovative Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) method to search for the best graphical representation of unresolved trees, in order to give biological meaning to the vertical order of taxa. METHODS: Starting from a West Nile virus phylogenetic tree, we developed it in a (1 + 1)-EA by randomly rotating the internal nodes and selecting the tree with the best fitness in each generation. Fitness is a sum of genetic distances between the considered taxon and the following r (radius) taxa. After having adjusted the radius to the best performance, we develop the trees with (lambda + mu)-EA to study the influence of the population on the algorithm. RESULTS: The (1 + 1)-EA consistently outperformed a random search, and better results were obtained by setting the radius to 8. The (lambda + mu)-EA performed as well as (1 + 1), except for the largest population. big. (1000 + 1000). CONCLUSIONS: Trees after evolution showed improvement in both fitness (based on a genetic distance matrix, so close taxa are actually genetically close) and biological interpretation. Samples collected in the same state or year moved closer to each other, making the tree easier to interpret. Biological relationships between samples are also easier to observe.",,"Cerutti, F.;Bertolotti, L.;Goldberg, T. L.;Giacobini, M.",2011.0,2001-07-01 00:00:00,,0

Phylogenetic analyzes classified Korean field isolates between 1988 and 1999 in subgroup 3.2, forming an independent clade distinct from classical swine fever viruses identified in other countries. In contrast, viruses isolated during the 2002-2003 classical swine fever epidemics were classified in a different subgroup (2.1). The 2.1 viruses showed a close genetic relationship (92.1-100% nucleotide similarity) to classical swine fever viruses reported from China and Taiwan in 1998-2001. As no evidence of CSFV infection was detected in the wild boar (Sus scrofa coreanus) population inhabiting Korea, the results of molecular characterization strongly suggest that CSF epidemic outbreaks in swine populations Korean strains during 2002-2003 were attributed to the introduction of a new strain or strains, probably from neighboring countries. © 2007 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Cha, S.

316,Molecular characterization of bovine ephemeral fever virus in Thailand between 2013 and 2017,"Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) is an arthropod-borne disease caused by bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV), a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus. BEFV is endemic to tropical and subtropical regions, including Thailand, a country in mainland Southeast Asia. However, there are few studies on BEFV and no information is available on the molecular characteristics of BEFV in Thailand. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to genetically characterize Thai BEFVs and reveal their evolutions through phylogenetic analysis of G gene ectodomain sequences. From 2013 to 2017, bovine blood samples matching the definition of BEF case of three regions of Thailand. Thai BEFV G genes and a complete genome from one isolate, East Asia/TH/LRI0045/2016, were sequenced and characterized. In addition, their phylogenies were constructed. This is the first report on the genetics of BEFV in Southeast Asia. The Thai BEFV ectodomain G coding region found during 2013–2017 is closely related to the second and third subclades of the East Asian lineage. In addition, we observed a mutation in the putative P' ORF of all Thai BEFVs that generated a premature stop codon. The Thai G gene sequences are closely related to those of isolates from mainland China and Taiwan. The complete genome sequences of Thai BEFV and East Asia/China/JT02 L/2002 have common features, suggesting a shared evolutionary relationship between the East and Southeast Asian strains. Further studies on the relationship between animal translocation, BEFV circulation in the Greater Mekong subregion, and the acquisition of more G gene sequences may improve understanding of the epidemiology of BEFV in mainland Southeast Asia.",,"Chaisirirat, T.;Sangthong, P.;Arunvipas, P.;Petcharat, N.;Thangthamniyom, N.;Chumsing, W.;Lekcharoensuk, P.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.10.013,0
317,Metagenomic analysis of antibiotic resistance genes in feces of dairy cows after therapeutic administration of third-generation cephalosporins,"Although dairy manure is widely applied to land, it is relatively understudied compared to other livestock as a potential source of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to the environment and ultimately to human pathogens. Ceftiofur, the most widely used antibiotic in US dairy cows, is a third-generation cephalosporin, a class of antibiotics critically important to human health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of typical antibiotic treatment with ceftiofur on ARG prevalence in the fecal microbiome of dairy cows using a metagenomics approach. β-lactam ARGs were found to be elevated in the feces of Holstein cows administered ceftiofur (n = 3) relative to control cows (n = 3). However, the total number of ARGs in all classes was not appreciably affected by ceftiofur treatment, likely due to the dominance of unaffected tetracycline ARGs in metagenomic libraries. Functional analysis via MG-RAST further revealed that ceftiofur treatment resulted in increases in gene sequences associated with ""phages, prophages, transposable elements, and plasmids"", suggesting that this treatment also enriched the ability to transfer ARGs. horizontally. Additional functional changes were observed with ceftiofur treatment (eg, upregulation of genes associated with stress, chemotaxis, and resistance to toxic compounds; downregulation of genes associated with aroma compound metabolism and cell division). cell cycle and cell cycle), along with measurable taxonomic changes (increase in Bacterioidia and decrease in Actinobacteria). This study demonstrates that ceftiofur has a broad, measurable and immediate effect on the cow fecal metagenome. Given the importance of third-generation cephalospirins to human medicine, their continued use in dairy cattle should be carefully considered and waste treatment strategies should be explored to slow the spread of ARGs from dairy cattle manure.

318,Interspecies transmission and emergence of new avian viruses,"Birds, the only living member of the clade Dinosauria, are warm-blooded, flying vertebrates displaying high species biodiversity, resting and migratory behavior, and a unique adaptive immune system. Birds provide the natural reservoir for many viral species and, therefore, the source of genes for the evolution, emergence and spread of new viruses. Human intrusions into the natural habitats of wild birds, the domestication of wild birds as pets or racing birds, and the increasing consumption of poultry by humans have made it easier for avian viruses to cross species barriers to cause disease. zoonosis. Recently, a new adenovirus was found exclusively in birds that caused an outbreak of Chlamydophila psittaci infection among birds and humans. Rather than being the primary cause of an outbreak by passing directly from bird to human, a new avian virus may be an enhancer of another zoonotic agent causing the outbreak. A comprehensive avian virome will improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of birds.",,"Chan, J. F. W.;To, K. K. W.;Chen, H.;Yuen, K. Y.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.coviro.2015.01.006,0

320,"Analysis of genomic sequences of 95 types of papillomaviruses: linking typing, phylogeny and taxonomy","Our aim was to study the phylogenetic relationships of all known papillomaviruses (PVs) and the possibility of establishing a supratype taxonomic classification based on this information. Of the many detectable homologous segments present in PV genomes, a 291-bp segment of the L1 gene stands out because it is flanked by consensus primers MY09 and MY11 and contains highly conserved amino acid residues that simplify sequence alignment. We determined the sequences MY09-MY11 of human PV type 20 (HPV-20), HPV-21, HPV-22, HPV-23, HPV-24, HPV-36, HPV-37, HPV-38, HPV-48, HPV -50, HPV-60, HPV-70, HPV-72, HPV-73, ovine (sheep) PV, bovine PV type 3 (BPV-3), BPV-5, and BPV-6 and created a database that now it encompasses HPV-1 through HPV-70, HPV-72, HPV-73, seven HPV genomes not yet typed, and 15 animal PV types. Three additional animal PVs were analyzed based on other sequence data. We construct phylogenies based on partial sequences of L1 and E6 genes and distinguish five main clades that we call supergroups. One of them unites 54 types of genital PV, which can be divided into eleven groups. The second supergroup has 24 types and unites most of the PVs typically found in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, but also includes several typical types of other skin lesions, such as HPV-4. The third supergroup unites the six known ungulate fibropapillomaviruses, the fourth includes the cutaneous ungulate PVs BPV-3, BPV-4, and BPV-6, and the fifth includes HPV-1, HPV-41, HPV-63, the oral PV canine. , and the cottontail rabbit PV. The PV finch and two PV rodents, Micromys minutus PV and Mastomys natalensis PV, are left ungrouped due to the relative isolation of each of their lineages. Within most supergroups, groups formed on the basis of cladistic principles unite phenotypically similar PV types.

The genomes of the two vaccine ILTV strains were sequenced using Illumina Genome Analyzer 2X 36 cycles of single-ended reads. The results revealed that few nucleotide differences were found (23 in Vaccine 1; 31 in Vaccine 2) and indicate that the US CEO strains are virtually identical to the Australian Serva CEO strain, which is a vaccine of European origin. Sequence differences demonstrated the spectrum of variability between vaccine strains. Only eight amino acid differences were found in ILTV proteins including UL54, UL27, UL28, UL20, UL1, ICP4 and US8 in vaccine 1. Similarly, in vaccine 2, eight amino acid differences were found in UL54, UL27 , UL28, UL36, UL1, ICP4, US10 and US8. Further comparison of the US CEO vaccines with various ILTV genome sequences revealed that the US CEO vaccines are genetically close to both the Serva and 63140/C/08/BR vaccines ( GenBank accession: HM188407) and are distinct from the two Australian-derived CEO vaccines, SA2 (GenBank accession: JN596962) and A20 (GenBank accession: JN596963), which showed high similarity to each other. These data demonstrate the potential of high-throughput sequencing technology to gain insight into the sequence variation of different ILTV strains.

324,"Lessons from the major epidemia of influenza virus in Taiwan, 2015","The largest avian influenza (AI) epidemic in history attacked poultry and wild birds throughout Taiwan starting on January 6, 2015. This study analyzed surveillance results, epidemiological characteristics, and viral sequences using information published by the government, with the intention of providing recommendations to minimize future influenza pandemics. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) H5 clade 2.3.4.4 had not been detected in Taiwan before 2015. During this epidemic, four types of etiologic agents were identified: the three new subtypes H5N2, H5N8, and H5N3 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIV and a chicken-endemic H5N2 (Mexican-like lineage) subtype of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Co-circulation of mixed subtypes also occurred, with HPAIV from the 2.3.4.4 H5N2 clade accompanied by H5N8 and H5N3 subtypes or older H5N2 viruses on the same farm. More than 90% of domestic geese died from this AI epidemic; geese were the most affected in the first outbreaks. The epidemic peaked in mid-January for the three new H5 subtypes. Spatial epidemiology found that the most affected areas were located in the coastal areas of the Southwest. In terrestrial poultry (mainly chickens), different geographic distributions of avian influenza virus subtypes were detected, with hot spots of the H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 versus former H5N2 viruses endemic in the past in the counties of Changhwa (P = 0.03) and Yunlin (P = 0.007). , respectively, from central Taiwan. Sequence and phylogenetic analyzes of all the first 10 H5 isolates from the 2.3.4.4 clade from Taiwan covering all three subtypes showed that they were very different from the HA of previous local H5 viruses of domestic ducks (75%-80%) and chickens (70%-75%). However, they had the highest percentages of sequence identity (99.53%-100%), with HA from A/crane/Kagoshima/KU13/2014(H5N8) isolated on December 7, 2014, in Japan, the most higher than that of recent Americans and Americans. Korea HPAIV H5 [A/Northern Rufouswood/Washington/40964/2014 (H5N2) and A/Gyrfalcon/Washington/41088-6/2014 (H5N8): 99.02%-99.54% and A/Baikal Teal /Korea/Donglim3/2014 ( H5N8): 98.61%-99.08%], implying a likely common ancestor of these H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses. The multiple HPAIV subtypes of clade H5 2.3.4.4 imply high viral reassortment.

325,Dual infection of gnotobiotic calves with bovine group A and porcine group C rotavirus strains influences the pathogenesis of group C rotavirus,"There is serologic evidence that group C bovine rotaviruses exist in the United States, but there are no reports of their isolation. Ninety fecal samples from calves with diarrhea, 81 samples from adult cows with diarrhea (winter dysentery), and 20 fecal samples from healthy adult cows were analyzed for group C rotavirus by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunological electron microscopy, and reverse transcription PCR. (RT-PCR). Three samples from adult cow diarrhea cases were positive only by RT-PCR, and a group C rotavirus was isolated from a positive sample in monkey kidney cells (MA104) (WD534tc/C). Genetically and serologically, the WD534tc/C strain was more closely related to the Cowden porcine group C strain than to the Shintoku bovine strain. Because the original cow faeces also contained a group A rotavirus (detected after passage in cell culture), we hypothesized that such dual rotavirus infections might play a role in pathogenesis and host adaptation to rotaviruses. . Therefore, we examined the pathogenesis of WD534tc/C alone or in combination with virulent (IND/A) or attenuated (NCDV/A) bovine group A rotavirus in gnotobiotic calves. WD534tc/C only induced diarrhea with no (or limited) virus shedding in inoculated calves (n = 3). In contrast, all WD534tc/C and IND/A coinfected calves (n = 2) developed diarrhea and shed both viruses, whereas WD534tc/C and NCDV/A coinfected calves (n = 3) developed diarrhea but did not. they excreted none of the virus. . Infection with either WD534tc/C or NCDV/A alone caused only mild villous atrophy (jejunum and/or ileum), whereas dual infection with both viruses induced lesions throughout the small intestine. Although IND/A only caused villous atrophy, more generalized lesions occurred in the small intestine in calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A. In conclusion, coinfection of calves with group A rotavirus improved faecal excretion of a group C bovine rotavirus and the extent of histopathologic lesions in the small intestine. Therefore, our findings suggest a new potential hypothesis involving dual infections for the adaptation of heterologous rotaviruses to new host species.",,"Chang, K. O.;Nielsen, P. R.;Ward, L.

326,Nipah virus: phylogeny and replication,"Phylogenetic analysis of Nipah virus isolates from Malaysia, Bangladesh, and Cambodia suggested the presence of at least two different groups of NiV strains. Based on the major glycoprotein (G) gene, the Nipah-Tambun virus isolate was grouped with Nipah virus isolates from Cambodia and Bangladesh, while the remaining Malaysian isolates were grouped in a separate group. Sequence heterogeneity was observed among Malaysian Nipah virus isolates, but the overall genomic sequence divergence value was small, suggesting a possible recent introduction of the virus. Nipah virus replicated well in stable porcine kidney cells and human lung fibroblast cells. Human monocytes, on the other hand, were infected with Nipah virus but the cells did not support productive infection. Similarly, infection of human neuronal cells did not result in the release of a high yield of infectious virus. Monocytes may serve to spread Nipah virus from the site of infection, including across the blood-brain barrier.

Little is known about the prevalence of TTMV in humans. Globally, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women. This study aimed to estimate the frequency of TTMV infection in cases of cervicitis and cervical tumors, including intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and adenocarcinoma, and the possible role of this virus in their etiology in a population of Isfahan. Methods: 79 cases of cervicitis and 42 tumors were collected from the histopathology files of Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, Iran. DNA was extracted and subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction. Results: Totally 62% of the analyzed samples were positive for TTMV. It was positive in 52.4% of adenocarcinomas, 68.4% of CIN, and 100% of SCC. In cervicitis, 48% of the cases were positive. In the phylogenetic construction, two of the cervical tumor isolates and two of the cervicitis isolates were placed in the same group with already reported isolates from Japan (EF538880 and AB041962). In addition, three of the isolated cervical tumors (JQ734980, JQ734981, and JQ734982) were placed in another group.

329,"Host specificity, pathogen exposure, and superinfections affect the distribution of Anaplasma phagocytophilum genotypes in ticks, roe deer, and cattle in a fragmented agricultural landscape.","Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a bacterial pathogen transmitted mainly by Ixodes ricinus ticks in Europe. It infects wild mammals, livestock, and occasionally humans. Roe deer are considered to be the main reservoir, but the genotypes they carry differ from those found in cattle and humans. Here, we investigated whether roe deer was the main source of A. phagocytophilum genotypes circulating for I. ricinus nymphs in a fragmented agricultural landscape in France. First, we evaluated pathogen prevalence in 1,837 I. ricinus nymphs (sampled along georeferenced transects) and 79 roe deer. The prevalence was radically different between ticks and roe deer: 1.9% vs. 76%, respectively. Second, using high-throughput amplicon sequencing, we characterized the diversity of A. phagocytophilum genotypes found in 22 infected ticks and 60 infected roe deer; the objective was to determine the frequency of coinfections. Only 22.7% of infected ticks carried roe deer-associated genotypes. This finding fits with others suggesting that livestock density is the main factor explaining the density of infected ticks. To explore epidemiological scenarios capable of explaining these patterns, we constructed compartmental models that focused on how A. phagocytophilum exposure and infection dynamics affected pathogen prevalence in roe deer. At the exposure levels predicted by the results of this study and the literature, the high prevalence in roe deer was only observed in the model where superinfections could occur during all phases of infection and when the probability of post-exposure infection was greater than 0.43.

331,Variations in lentiviral gene expression in naturally infected sheep monocyte-derived macrophages,"Seventy-nine 1-year-old lambs from three individual farms and one feedlot were tested for natural lentivirus infection. We used three different methods to detect infection and to identify the life cycle stage of ovine lentivirus in blood-derived macrophages. Infectious cytopathic virus was obtained from 14/14 Border Leicester animals obtained from a naturally infected herd. No virus particles, virus proteins, virus-specific antibodies, or viral DNA were detected in samples from 34 lambs from two farms south of Kansas City. However, among 31 fattening lambs, we identified 11 infected animals. Specific viral proteins were immunoprecipitated from macrophages of one animal, but no infectious cytopathic virus was isolated from these cells. Cells from ten of the other fattening animals harbored viral DNA, but our techniques could not detect viral particles or proteins. Thus, in these naturally infected animals, the virus life cycle was either completed, subject to differentiation of infected precursor cells in the blood, or remained arrested at the DNA stage despite maturation from monocytes to macrophages. Analysis of the env gene sequence of viral genomes from two of the ten feedlot sheep showed sequences distinct from those of known sheep and goat lentiviruses. Surprisingly, these sequences have greater identity (of nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences) to caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus than to the sheep prototype, maedi-visna virus. These data suggest that the ovine and caprine lentiviruses found in North American sheep may have a common ancestral genotype that is closely related to the caprine virus.",,"Chebloune, Y.;Karr, B.;Sheffer, D.;Leung, K.;Narayan, O.",1996.0,,,0
332,Infer clonal structure of viral populations from time series sequencing,"RNA virus populations will undergo mutation and selection processes resulting in a mixed population of viral particles. High-throughput sequencing of a viral population subsequently contains a mixed signal from the underlying clones. We would like to identify the underlying evolutionary structures. We use two sources of information to try this; within segment linkage information and mutation prevalence. We show that the haplotypes of clones, their prevalence, and the maximally parsimonious crosslinked evolutionary structures can be identified, although the solutions may not be unique, even for complete information sets. This applies to an influenza chain of infection, where we infer evolutionary structures, including rearrangement, and demonstrate some of the interpretation difficulties that arise from deep sequencing due to artifacts such as template switching during PCR amplification.",,"Chedom, D.

333,Transfer of viral communities between human individuals during fecal microbiota transplantation,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for refractory Clostridium difficile infections. However, concerns remain about unwanted co-transfer of pathogenic microbes such as viruses. Here we study FMT from a single healthy human donor to three pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis, each of whom received a course of 22 to 30 FMT treatments. Viral particles were purified from donor and recipient stool samples and sequenced; The reads were then assembled into contigs corresponding to viral genomes or partial genomes. Transfer of selected viruses was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Viral contigs present in the donor could be readily detected in recipients, with up to 32 different donor viral contigs appearing in a recipient sample. Reassuringly, none of these viruses replicate in human cells. Instead, the viral contigs were classified as bacteriophages or could not be taxonomically attributed, suggesting unstudied phages. The two most frequently transferred gene types were associated with moderate phage replication. In addition, members of the Siphoviridae, the typically temperate phage group that includes phage lambda, were found to transfer with significantly higher efficiency than other groups. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the moderate phage replication style may promote the efficient transfer of phages between human individuals. In summary, we documented the transfer of multiple viral lineages between human individuals via FMT, but in this case series, none belonged to viral groups known to infect human cells. SIGNIFICANCE Transfer of entire virus communities between humans has rarely been studied, but is likely to be of medical importance. Here we study fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a very successful treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and potentially other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. We investigated the transfer of viral communities during FMT and documented the transfer of multiple viral lineages between humans. None of these were viruses that replicated in animal cells or were known to be pathogenic. We found that temperate bacteriophages, which form stable associations with their hosts, were significantly more likely to transfer during FMT. This supports a model in which the viral temperate replication style may have evolved in part to support efficient viral transmission between environments.",,"Chehoud, C.;Dryga, A.;Hwang, Y.;Nagy-Szakal, D.;Hollister, E.

In this article, we report the complete genome sequence of the hitherto unsequenced Indian vaccinia virus strain R2B. The viral genome is 15,186 nucleotides long and contains the polybasic amino acid motif at the fusion protein cleavage site, indicating that this vaccine strain has evolved from a virulent virus.

335,Minimal Core Genome Sequence Typing of Bacterial Pathogens: A Unified Approach to Public Health and Clinical Microbiology,"Bacterial pathogens impose a heavy health burden worldwide. In the new era of high-throughput sequencing and online bioinformatics, real-time genome typing of infectious agents, and particularly those with potentially serious clinical outcomes, promises to guide clinical care to limit the detrimental effects of infectious agents. infections and prevent possible local infections. or global outbreaks. Here, we sequence and compare 85 isolates of Streptococcus suis, a human and swine zoonotic pathogen, where we analyze 32 recognized serotypes and 75 sequence types representing species diversity and human clinical isolates with high public health importance. We found that 1,077 of the 2,469 genes are shared by all isolates. Excluding 201 common but mobile genes, 876 genes were defined as the minimal core genome (MCG) of the species. Of 190,894 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified, 58,501 were located in MCG genes and were designated MCG SNPs. An analysis of the population structure of these MCG SNPs classified the 85 isolates into seven MCG groups, of which MCG group 1 includes all isolates from human infections and outbreaks. Our MCG typing system for S. suis provided a clear separation of groups containing human-associated isolates from those containing animal-associated isolates. It also separated the group containing isolates from outbreaks, including those causing life-threatening streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome, from isolates from sporadic or less severe meningitis or bacteremia. The typing system facilitates the application of genome data to the fields of clinical medicine and epidemiology and to S. suis surveillance. MCG groups can also be used as taxonomic units of S. suis to define bacterial subpopulations with the potential to cause serious clinical infections and large-scale outbreaks.",,"Chen, C.;Zhang, W.;Zheng, H.;Lan, R.;Wang, H.;Du, P.;Bai, X.;Ji, S.;Meng, Q.;Jin, D.;Liu, K.;Jing, H.;Ye, C.;Gao, G.

336,Genetic analysis of virulence and antimicrobial resistance of plasmid pOU7519 in Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis,"Background: Zoonotic Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis (S. Choleraesuis), which causes paratyphoid in pigs and bacteremia in humans, commonly carries a separate or fused virulence plasmid and sometimes an antimicrobial resistance plasmid. This study aimed to analyze the likely mechanism of how to form a virulence resistance plasmid chimera in S. Choleraesuis. Methods: The complete plasmid sequence of pOU7519 in S. choleraesuis strain OU7519 was determined using shotgun cloning and sequencing. Annotations and sequence comparisons were performed to determine the sequence responsible for the formation of a virulence resistant chimeric pOU7519. Other chimeric plasmids were also confirmed among the collected strains of S. Choleraesuis. Results: The pOU719 sequence, 127,212 bp in length, was identified as a chimera of the virulence plasmid pSCV50 and a multidrug resistant plasmid pSC138 that have been found in S. choleraesuis strain SC-B67. pOU7519 is a conjugative plasmid that carries several mobile DNAs, including prophages, insertion sequences, integrons, and transposons, especially a Tn. 6088-like transposon. Dissecting the pSCV50-pSC138 chimera binding site in pOU7519 found defective sequences in the scv50 integrase gene (int) and its binding site (att), and that likely resulted in a plasmid stable chimera due to failure to cleave the pSCV50-pSC138 chimera. A similar chimeric structure was also found in other large plasmids. Conclusion: Removal of int and att sties could likely block chimera cleavage and result in an irreversible and stable pSCV50-pSC138 chimera. The emergence of antimicrobial resistant and conjugative virulence plasmids in S. Choleraesuis could represent a threat to public health.",,"Chen, C. L.;Su, L. H.;Janapatla, R. P.;Lin, C. Y.;Chiu, C.

One of the putative genes is homologous to a gene implicated in Graves' disease and ANT2, and two others are confirmed by EST matches.

Pbi, Micromonas pusilla and Chrysochromulina spp.). Phylogenetic trees d in DNA pol sequences and total genomic DNA hybridization showed similar branching patterns. Genetic relatedness calculated from hybridization and sequence data showed good agreement (r = 0.90), indicating that pol DNA sequences can be used to determine genetic relatedness and infer phylogenetic relationships between these viruses. The phylogenetic tree inferred from the DNA pol deduced amino acid sequences of 24 dsDNA viruses, including phycodnaviruses, herpesviruses, poxviruses, baculoviruses, and African swine fever virus, corresponded well with groupings based on the Committee International Taxonomy of Viruses. Microalgal viruses are more closely related to each other than to the other dsDNA viruses and form a distinct phyletic group, suggesting that they share a common ancestor and belong to the Phycodnaviridae. Furthermore, the Phycodnaviridae are more closely related to the Herpesviridae than to other virus families for which DNA pol sequences are available.",,"Chen, F.;Suttle, C.

However, the differences between somatic cells and post-infection immune cells remain poorly understood. The objective of our study was to detect the different responses in chicken to ALV-J infection in different cell lines. In this study, we detected changes in transcriptome expression during ALV-J infection in chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) and HD11 cell lines. RNA-Seq was used to determine the expression levels of mRNA transcripts from the two cell types after ALV-J infection at 1, 4, and 7 dpi, and gene ontology analyzes were used to cluster differentially expressed genes. on tracks.

Timely identification of new viruses using NGS technologies is also important for us to control emerging infectious diseases caused by new viruses. In this study, we identified a novel duck coronavirus (CoV), distinct from chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), using RNA-Seq. The new duck-specific CoV was a potential new species within the Gammacoronavirus genus, as indicated by the sequences of three regions in the viral 1b gene. We also conducted a CoV survey in domestic birds in China using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene. A total of 102 CoV positives were identified through the survey. Phylogenetic analysis of N viral sequences suggested that CoVs in domestic birds have been divided into several region- or host-specific clades or subclades in the world, and IBVs can infect ducks, geese, and pigeons, although they mainly circulate. in chickens. Furthermore, this study provided novel data supporting the idea that some host-specific CoVs, in addition to IBVs, circulate in ducks, geese, and pigeons, and indicated that the novel duck-specific CoV identified via RNA-Seq in this study is genetically closer to some CoV. circulating in wild waterfowl.

347,"Isolation, genome sequencing and functional analysis of two T7-type coliphages of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli","Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) causes colibacillosis, resulting in significant economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Due to drug residues and increased antibiotic resistance caused by the use of antibiotics, bacteriophages and other alternative therapeutic agents are expected to control APEC infection in poultry. Two APEC phages, designated P483 and P694, were isolated from feces at a farmers' market in China. We then studied their biological properties and carried out high-throughput genome sequencing and homology analyzes of these phages. Assembly results from high-throughput sequencing showed that the structures of the P483 and P694 genomes consist of linear and double-stranded DNA. The results of electron microscopy and homology analysis revealed that both P483 and P694 belong to the T7-like virus, which is a member of the family Podoviridae of the order Caudovirales. Comparative genomic analysis showed that most of the predicted proteins from these two phages showed stronger sequence similarity to Enterobacteria phage BA14 and 285P, Erwinia phage FE44, and Kluyvera phage Kvp1; however, some proteins such as gp0.6a, gp1.7 and gp17 showed less similarity (<.85%) with the homologues of other phages of the T7 subgroup. We also found some unique features of P483 and P694, such as the two gene types of P694 and no lytic activity of P694 against its host bacteria in liquid medium.

348,Deep sequencing details the cross-mapping of chimeric genes in two infectious porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus clones,"BACKGROUND: Recombination is a major contributor to the genetic diversity of most viruses. A reverse genetics system using green fluorescence protein (GFP) and infectious clones expressing enhanced GFP (EGFP) was developed to study the requirements for recombination. However, it is still unclear what types of interbreeding events occurred to produce the viable offspring. OBJECTIVE: We used 454 sequences to infer recombination events in this system. METHOD: Two infectious porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) clones, P129-EGFP-97C and P129-GFPm-d(2-6), were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells. P129-EGFP-97C is a fully functional virus that contains a non-fluorescent EGFP. P129-GFPm-d(2-6) is a defective virus but contains a fluorescent GFPm. Successful recombination was evident by the appearance of fully functional virus progeny expressing fluorescence. Total RNA was extracted from infected cells expressing fluorescence and the entire fluorescent gene was amplified to prepare an amplicon library for 454 sequencing. RESULTS: Deep sequencing showed that nucleotide identities changed from ~37% (in the region variable from 21 nt to 165 nt) to 20% (T<sub>289</sub>C) to ~38% (456-651 nt) and then 100% (672-696nt) compared to EGFP. Results indicated that crossover events occurred in three conserved regions (166-288 nt, 290-455 nt, 652-671 nt), which were also supported by sequence alignments. Surprisingly, the short conservation region (652-671 nt) proved to be a crossover hotspot. In addition, four crossover patterns (two single crossovers and two double crossovers) could be used to produce viable recombinants. CONCLUSION: The reverse genetics system incorporating the use of high-throughput sequencing creates a genetic platform to study the generation of viable recombinant viruses.",,"Chen, N.;Chand, R.

Real-time RT-PCR revealed a unique course of infection for the SCID group. During the course of infection, viraemia was initially significantly lower than that of normal littermates, but by 21 days it was significantly elevated. Deep sequencing of viral structural genes at days 11 and 21 identified seven amino acid substitutions in both normal and SCID pigs. The most significant change was a substitution of W99R in GP2, which was present in the inoculum at a frequency of 35%, but eventually disappeared from all pigs regardless of immune status. Therefore, the amino acid substitutions that appear during acute infection are probably the result of adaptation of the virus to replication in pigs and not of immune selection.",,"Chen, N.;Dekkers, J.

However, the virome of PEDV-infected pigs and its effect on disease severity is still unknown. Advances in sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites for any given host. Methods: The aim of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomic approach based on next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive porcine fecal swab samples collected from diarrheal piglets in 17 US states during 2015-2016 were tested. Results: A bioinformatic analysis based on the Kraken algorithm revealed the presence of up to 9 different RNA genera in addition to PEDV (genus Alphacoronavirus), including Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31%, 67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Passivirus (9%, 20/217), and Deltacoronavirus (3%, 6/217). There were 58 of 217 piglets (27%) that only had PEDV infection, while the remaining 159 (73%) shed 2 to 9 different viruses.

351,"A new species of astrovirus in the intestine of yaks with diarrhea in the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau, 2013","The yak (Bos grunniens) is an iconic symbol in the high altitude region of the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau. Diarrhea is a common disease in yaks, resulting in large economic losses. To investigate viral species diversity, we report the metagenomic-derived virome in a pooled fecal sample from 20 diarrheal yaks. The nine viruses found in the pooled diarrhea samples, in order of nucleic acid sequence abundance, were influenza A virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), rotavirus, ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (bovine hokovirus), astrovirus ( AstV), bovine enterovirus, hepatitis E virus, kobuvirus and woodchuck hepatitis virus. Compared to healthy yaks, only AstV had a significantly higher prevalence rate in diarrheal samples, indicating a correlation with clinical symptoms of diarrhea in yaks. To further investigate the molecular characterization of yak AstV, a nearly complete genome was obtained from a diarrheal sample. It was 6243 bp in length and shared 46.4-66.2% similarity with other related bovine AstVs from faeces. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome showed that yak AstV was within the bovine AstV group, but was located in a single lineage, suggesting that a new AstV species was identified in yaks. Interestingly, the yak AstV ORF2 region had a closer similarity and genetic relationship to the deer AstV strain CcAstV-2 than to bovine AstVs. Further analysis showed that a possible interspecies recombination event occurred at ORF2. In summary, this study furthered our understanding of the viral communities of diarrheal yaks and identified a new AstV that was associated with diarrhea in yaks.",,"Chen, X.;Zhang, B.;Yue, H.;Wang, Y.;Zhou, F.;Zhang, Q.;Tang, C.",2015.0,,10.1099/jgv.0.000303,1
352,Cloning and molecular characterization of the ORF5 gene of a PRRSV-SN strain from Southwest China,"To monitor the genetic variation of PRRSV, the ORF5 gene of the PRRSV-SN strain found in Suining City, Sichuan Province was cloned and sequenced. The results showed that the PRRSV-SN strain was a highly pathogenic variant strain of PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) with the North American (NA) genotype. Homology analysis showed that the ORF5 gene of the PRRSV-SN isolate shared 89.4% (86.5%) nucleotide (amino acid) sequence similarity with the North American strain VR-2332, a similarity of 98.8% (96%) with JXA1 and a similarity of 63.8% (57.7%) similarity with the representative strain of the European type of Lelystad virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PRRSV-SN belongs to the NA genotype and has the same subtype as other highly pathogenic PRRSV strains. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that, compared to strain VR2332, PRRSV-SN has different degrees of variation in the signal peptide, transmembrane (TM) region, primary neutralizing epitope (PNE), non-neutral epitopes and the N-glycosylation sites. Antigenicity analysis showed that PRRSV-SN ORF5 and JXA1 gene products have similar antigenic characteristics, and antigenic epitopes are found mainly in the aa30-39, aa50-60, aa128-141, aa146-155 and aa161-183 regions. . In contrast, the antigenic characteristics of PRRSV-SN are quite different from those of the VR2332 strain. The main differences were that the PRRSV-SN strain was significantly narrower than the VR2332 strain in the aa30-39 and aa50-60 regions, but was significantly broader in the aa136-141 region. The results of this study showed that the epidemic strains causing PRRSV outbreaks on the farm are still mainly variants of JXA1, but due to the more frequent use of immunizations with live vaccines, the genes of the epidemic strain of PRRSV still show constant variation. . Vaccination with live PRRSV should be reduced and surveillance of PRRSV strains should be improved.",,"Chen, X. W.;Li, L.;Yin, M.;Wang, Q.;Luo, W. T.;Ma, Y.;Pu, Z. H.;Zhou, J. L.",2017.0,Nov,,0
353,Phylogenetic Analysis of Human/Swine/Avian Gene Recombinant H1N2 Influenza Virus Isolated from a Pig in China,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective in this study was to determine the genetic characterization and probable origin of the H1N2 (A/Swine/Guangxi/13/2006) swine influenza virus (Sw/GX/13/06) from the lung tissue of a pig in Guangxi province, China. METHODS: Eight genes from Sw/GX/13/06 were cloned and genetically analyzed. RESULTS: Hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix (M), and nonstructural (NS) genes from Sw/GX/13/06 were most closely related to genes from the classical lineage of H1N1 swine influenza virus. . The neuraminidase (NA) and PB1 genes were most closely related to the corresponding genes of the H3N2 human influenza virus lineage. The remaining two polymerase genes PA and PB2 were more closely related to genes from the avian influenza virus lineage. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic analyzes revealed that Sw/GX/13/06 was a human/swine/avian H1N2 virus and closely related to H1N2 viruses isolated from pigs in the United States (1999-2001) and Korea (2002). To our knowledge, Sw/GX/13/06 was the first triple reassortant influenza A H1N2 virus isolated from a pig in China. It remains to be further investigated whether SW/GX/13/06 poses a potential threat to breeding farm and human health.",,"Chen, Y.;Meng, X.;Liu, Q.;Huang, X.;Huang, S.;Liu, C.;Shi, K.;Guo, J.;Chen, F.;Hu, L.",2008.0,,,0
354,Gene expression profile after RIG-I activation in DF1 challenged with 5'ppp-dsRNA,"Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) can recognize influenza viruses and elicit the innate immune response. RIG-I is absent in the chicken genome but is conserved in the duck genome. The lack of RIG-I makes chickens more susceptible to avian influenza infection and clinical symptoms are more prominent than in other poultry. It is unknown whether introduction of duck RIG-I into chicken cells can establish immunity as seen in ducks and the role of RIG-I in established immunity is unknown. In this study, a chicken cell strain with stable expression of duRIG-I was established by lentiviral infection, giving rise to DF1/LV5-RIG-I, and a DF1/LV5 control strain was established in parallel. To verify stable and high-level expression of duRIG-I in DF1 cells, duRIG-I mRNA and protein levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. In addition, double-stranded 5'triphosphate RNA (5'ppp-dsRNA) was used to mimic an RNA virus infection, and infected DF1/LV5-RIG-I and DF1/LV5 cells were subjected to high-performance RNA sequencing. yield, yielding 193.46 M reads and 39.07 G bases. A total of 278 differentially expressed genes (DEG), ie duRIG-I mediated responsive genes, were identified by RNA-seq. Among the 278 genes, 120 DEGs are annotated in the KEGG database, and the most reliable KEGG pathways are likely to be RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways. Functional gene ontology (GO) analysis indicates that the functions of these DEGs are mainly related to type I interferon (IFN) signaling, IFN-β-mediated cellular responses, and upregulation of the RIG-I signaling pathway. . Based on the genes shared between different pathways, a network representing crosstalk between RIG-I and other signaling pathways was constructed using Cytoscape software. The network suggests that the RIG-mediated pathway may interact with the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, the Wnt signaling pathway, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and the MAPK signaling pathway during transduction of antiviral signals. After selection, the differential expression of a group of key response genes in RIG-I-mediated signaling pathways, such as ISG12-2, Mx1, IFIT5, TRIM25, USP18, STAT1, STAT2, IRF1, IRF7 and IRF8.

Phage vB_BbrM_PHB04 exhibited growth in a wide range of temperature and pH conditions and showed different efficiency of plaque values and lytic spectra within the same strains at 25 °C and 37 °C. High-throughput sequencing revealed that vB_BbrM_PHB04 has a linear double-stranded DNA genome with 124 putative open reading frames. Overall, the vB_BbrM_PHB04 genome showed very low similarity (highest 82% nucleotide identity, 1% coverage) to other phage sequences in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that vB_BbrM_PHB04 is a new member of the Myoviridae family.

358,Genetic Diversity in Envelope Genes of Contemporary US Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus Strains Influences Viral Antigenicity,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically important diseases in pigs caused by the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Genome sequences of sixty-six strains of PRRSV were obtained by metagenomic sequencing of serum samples collected in the US in 2014 to explore contemporary genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analysis of genes encoding envelope proteins identified four to eight distinct lineages with >87% intraclade identity. To explore the effect of observed genetic diversity on antigenicity, the genome regions encoding GP2a-GP3-GP4 or GP5-M in strain SD95-21 were replaced with alleles from each of eight distinct PRRSV strains using genetics. reverse. The GP2a-GP3-GP4 region of only four of the eight strains produced viable recombinant viruses. When viable, both GP2a-GP3-GP4 and GP5-M variably affected antigenicity. A significant strain-dependent loss in cross-reactivity was variably observed by indirect immunofluorescence assays using antisera from pigs vaccinated with commercial modified live vaccines after replacement of GP2a-GP3-GP4 or GP5-M. Significantly reduced neutralizing titers were similarly measured using antisera from pigs naturally exposed to PRRSV.

Evolutionary rates in the E2 gene were slightly faster than in other regions. We also identify population structures below the subgenotype level that are likely to have phenotypic implications. Two distinct groups within BVDV2a are present and can be differentiated, in part, by a tyrosine to isoleucine mutation at position 963 in the E2 protein, a position implicated in the antigenicity of BVDV1 isolates.

Our previous work shows that orf is ubiquitous in the Chinese province of Fujian, a region where there is considerable heterogeneity among ORFVs. In this study, we sequenced complete genomes of four Fujian goat ORFV strains (OV-GO, OV-YX, OV-NP, and OV-SJ1). The four strains were 132-139 kb in length, and each contained 124-132 genes and approximately 64% G+C content. The most notable differences between the four strains were found near the ends of the genome. OV-NP lacked seven and OV-SJ1 lacked three genes near the far right compared to other ORFVs. We also investigated the cutaneous virulence of the four Fujian ORFVs in goats. ORFVs with gene deletions showed low virulence, while ORFVs without gene deletions showed high virulence in goats, suggesting that gene deletion possibly leads to ORFV attenuation. Gene 134 was disrupted in the OV-NP genome due to lack of initial code. Phylogenetic tree based on complete genomes of Parapoxviruse showed that ORFVs originating from sheep and goats formed clearly separate branches with 100% bootstrapping. Based on the single-gene phylogenetic tree of 132 ORFV genes, 47 genes can be easily distinguished as originating from sheep or goats. In order to further reveal the genetic variation exhibited in goat and sheep ORFVs, we analyzed the deduced amino acid sequences of the 008 gene, the multiple alignment of amino acid sequences of the 008 gene from the genome of five goat ORFVs and four ORFVs. from sheep revealed 33 unique amino acids. acids differentiating it by having sheep or goats as host.

Sequences were compared to other GenBank sequences using phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches. Our results show a high sequence variability in Brazil, since, in this work, the Brazilian isolates were classified in subgroup 1AB, 2D and 2, which reveals that the virus was introduced in Brazil more than once. On the other hand, most of the Brazilian isolates seem to derive from a single introduction. According to data from the Pig Breeders Association, the multiple introductions of the virus probably occurred through the importation of animals with the asymptomatic form of the virus or through the importation of contaminated semen.

368,Ranaviruses and other members of the Iridoviridae family: Their place in the virosphere,"Members of the family Iridoviridae, collectively called iridovirids, are large, double-stranded DNA-containing viruses that infect cold-blooded (ectothermic) invertebrates and vertebrates. Infections in the former often lead to massive levels of virus replication resulting in iridescence of the infected animal and ultimately death. Among the latter, infections target a variety of organs and are capable of causing high levels of morbidity and mortality among commercially and ecologically important fish and amphibian species. The viral replication strategy has been elucidated mainly through the study of frog virus 3 (FV3) with additional contributions from other iridovirids of ecological or commercial importance. Replication occurs within the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments and involves the synthesis of genome-length and concatemeric DNA, extensive methylation of the viral genome (only among vertebrate viruses), coordinated expression of three classes of viral gene products, and the formation of icosahedral virions within the cytoplasmic viral assembly.

It has a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 19.2 kb, containing the small, medium, and large segments. CCHFVs are relatively divergent in their genome sequence and are grouped into seven distinct clades based on S-segment sequence analysis and six clades based on M-segment sequences. Our goal was to gain new insights into the molecular epidemiology of CCHFV in Iran. . Methods: We analyzed partial and complete nucleotide sequences of the S and M segments derived from 50 Iranian patients. The extracted RNA was amplified by one-step RT-PCR and then sequenced. Sequences were analyzed using Mega5 software. Results: Phylogenetic analysis of partial S-segment sequences showed that clade IV-(Asia 1), clade IV-(Asia 2), and clade V-(Europe) accounted for 80%, 4%, and 14% of the circulating genomic variants of CCHFV in Iran respectively. However, one of the Iranian strains (Iran-Kerman/22) did not associate with any of the other sequences and formed a new clade (VII). Phylogenetic analysis of complete S-segment nucleotide sequences of selected Iranian CCHFV strains complemented with representative strains from GenBank revealed similar topology as partial sequences with eight main groups. A partial phylogeny of the M segment positioned the Iranian strains in association with clade III (Asia-Africa) or clade V (Europe).

Two recent PCV isolates (CT-PCV-P5, CT-PCV-P6) were from 2 affected newborn pigs, from different farms, with unrelated outbreaks of CT; type A2. Four isolates (PMWS-PCV-Pl, PMWS-PCV-P2, PMWS-PCV-P3, PMWS-PCV-P4) originated from pigs with PMWS from 4 different farms. A comparative analysis of these PMWS and PCV isolates demonstrated 99% sequence identity with each other and greater than 96% sequence identity with previously sequenced PCV2 isolates. However, the CT-PCV-P5 and CT-PCV-P6 isolates shared 99% of the same identity with each other and, interestingly, also with the PMWS PCV isolates.

Twenty-two of 99 indigenous Korean calves with diarrhea were identified as positive for BVDV and 3 different sequences of 50 untranslated regions (UTRs) were determined. The results indicated that BVDV infections in the Republic of Korea were found mainly in winter and when calves were less than 20 days old. Phylogenetic analysis based on 50-UTR revealed that our indigenous Korean calf cases belonged to BVDV-2a. Therefore, the result of this study will be useful to understand the epidemiology and enable farmers in the Republic of Korea to better protect their cattle. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.",,"Choi, K.

374,Avian influenza viruses in Korean live bird markets and their pathogenic potential,"We surveyed live poultry markets in Korea in 2003 and isolated 9 H9N2, 6 H3N2, and 1 H6N1 influenza viruses. Antigenic and phylogenetic analyzes showed that the 9 H9N2 isolates were of the lineage similar to A/Chicken/Korea/25232-96006/96 (which caused disease in chickens in Korea in 1996), but were different from H9N2 viruses from the southeast from China. They had at least 4 genotypes and replicated in chickens but not mice. The H3N2 and H6N1 viruses were new to Korea and were likely a mixture of avian influenza viruses from southeast China and recent Korean H9N2 viruses. The 8 segments of the H3N2 viruses formed a single phylogenetic group with 99.1 to 100% homology. H3N2 viruses replicated in chickens and mice without prior adaptation, but H6N1 viruses did not. Our results show an increasingly diverse group of avian influenza viruses in Korea that are potential pandemic influenza agents. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,"Choi, Y.

375,Viral metagenomics reveals the presence of highly divergent quaranjaviruses in Rhipicephalus ticks from Mozambique,"Background: Ticks are primary vectors for many known disease-causing agents that affect human and animal populations globally, such as tick-borne encephalitis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and African swine fever. In this study, viral metagenomics was used to identify which viruses are present in Rhipicephalus spp. ticks collected in the Zambezi Valley in Mozambique. Methods: RNA was amplified with sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and high-throughput sequencing was performed on the Ion Torrent platform. The generated sequences were subjected to quality control and classified by BLAST. CodonCode and SeqMan aligners were used to assemble the sequences. Results: Most viral sequences showed closer sequence identity to the family Orthomyxoviridae, although viruses similar to Parvoviridae and Coronaviridae were also identified. Nearly complete sequences of five orthomyxoviral segments (HA, NP, PB1, PB2, and PA) were obtained, showing 32-52% amino acid identity with known quaranjaviruses. The sequences were most closely related to Wellfleet Bay virus, detected and isolated from the common eider during a mortality event in the US. Conclusions: In summary, this study has identified a highly divergent virus within the family Orthomyxoviridae associated with ticks. Rhipicephalus from Mozambique.

377,Effect of seasonal vaccination on the selection of epidemic variants of influenza A/H3N2,"The effect of vaccination on influenza virus variant dynamics remains largely unknown in humans, as opposed to poultry. In this study, we compared influenza hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences isolated from vaccinated and unvaccinated populations with annual vaccine strains. In total, 181 influenza A/H3N2 virus samples isolated from 82 vaccinated and 99 unvaccinated patients (2011-15, four Japanese influenza seasons) were genetically analyzed using a next-generation sequencer. Amino acid (AA) differences from the corresponding vaccine strains were found in 74 of 329 HA1 sites. There were a maximum of four AA differences within epitopes in the previous three seasons (2011-14) and fifteen in the last season (2014-15). The shift to a higher number of AA differences was found to be more significantly found in isolates from vaccinated patients compared to unvaccinated patients (P = 0.0005 in 2011-14; P = 0.0096 in 2014-15) . AA difference rates within epitopes were also significantly higher in isolates from vaccinated patients than in unvaccinated patients (2.64% vs. 2.14% for 2011-14, P=0.033; 7.78 % vs. 6.59% for 2014-15, P=0.058). AA differences at seven sites (48I-278K, 128A-142G, 145S, 158K, and 193S) became dominant in subsequent seasons. In all of these sites, dominance was retained during mismatching of isolates with vaccine strains and was lost after vaccine pairing.

In this study, NGS was applied to clinical samples from poultry in Jordan to detect eleven low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAIV) H9N2 viruses. All viruses tested belonged to the Middle East A genetic group of the G1 lineage. Deep sequencing demonstrated a high degree of heterogeneity of the glutamine and leucine residues at position 226 in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene, increasing specificity for avian or mammalian receptors. Furthermore, additional amino acid changes in PB1, PA, M1, M2 and NS1 were identified among the viruses tested.

Objectives: to identify new viruses in human stool samples from patients with diarrhea and to investigate the ecology and clinical importance of these viruses. Study Design: Nucleic acid extracted from stool samples of patients with diarrhea of unknown aetiology was subjected to random PCR amplification and Roche/454 pyrosequencing. The newly identified viruses were characterized genetically and epidemiologically. Results: Four gyroviruses were identified, chicken anemia virus (CAV), human gyrovirus (HGV)/avian gyrovirus 2 (AGV2), gyrovirus 3 (GyV3), and one new gyrovirus (tentatively designated gyrovirus 4 ( GyV4)) in human stool samples. . GyV4, as well as CAV and AGV2/HGV, were also detected in chicken skin and meat used for human consumption. Conclusions: A new gyrovirus (GyV4) was identified in human feces and in chicken meat sold for human consumption.

384,Pathotyping and phylogenetic characterization of Newcastle disease virus isolated in Peru: definition of two new subgenotypes within genotype XII,"Infections of poultry with virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1), also known as Newcastle disease virus (NDV), cause Newcastle disease (ND). This highly contagious disease affects poultry and many other bird species around the world. In countries where the disease is prevalent, constant monitoring and characterization of isolates causing outbreaks is necessary. In this study, we report the results of pathogenicity tests and phylogenetic analyzes of seven VEN isolates from various regions of Peru between 2004 and 2015. Six viruses had intracerebral pathogenicity indices (ICPI) between 1.75 and 1.88, corresponding to a velogenic pathotype. The remaining virus had an ICPI of 0.00, corresponding to alentogenic pathotype. These results were consistent with the amino acid sequences at the fusion protein (F) cleavage site. All velogenic isolates had the polybasic amino acid sequence 112RRQKRâ†“F117 at the F cleavage site. Phylogenetic analyzes of the complete F gene sequences showed that all isolates fall into APMV-1 class II. The velogenic viruses are classified as genotype XII, while the lentegenic virus is classified as genotype II, closely related to the LaSota vaccine strain. Furthermore, the tree topology, bootstrap values, and observed genetic distances within genotype XII resulted in the identification of new subgenotypes XIIa (in South America) and XIIb (in China) and possibly two clades within genotype XIIa. All Peruvian velogenic viruses belonged to the XIIa subgenotype. In general, our results confirm the presence of genotype XII in Peru and suggest that it is the prevalent genotype currently circulating in our country. Phylogenetic characterization of these isolates helps characterize the evolution of NDV and may help with the development of vaccines specific to our regional needs.",,"Chumbe, A.;Izquierdo-Lara, R.;Tataje, L.;Gonzalez, R.;Cribillero, G.;GonzÃ¡lez, A.

385,Introduction to the ecology of arboviruses (Russian),"Arboviruses comprise the largest group of vertebrate viruses. By 1972, approximately 400 arboviruses had been recorded in the world, of which some 260 viruses were classified into 41 groups on the basis of their antigenic properties; 130 viruses are ungrouped so far. In the Universal Classification System for viruses, arboviruses are included in 6 genes: Alphaviruses, Flaviviruses, Rhabdoviruses, Reoviruses, Arenaviruses, and Enteroviruses. Members of these genera differ markedly in biology, morphology, and biochemical and antigenic properties, indicating the heterogeneous nature of the arbovirus group. The heterogeneity of this group suggests that arthropod transmission of the viruses as a mode of spread originated independently in different systematically remote virus genera. All known arboviruses are pathogenic only for vertebrates. They also multiply in the tissue of arthropods (in vivo and in vitro) but do not exert any pathogenic effect on them. It should be noted that arthropod-specific viruses do not multiply in vertebrate tissues. The circulation cycles of arboviruses are essentially determined by the trophic relationships of hematophagous arthropods with vertebrates. These relationships are more numerous with the group of mammals that are parasitized by approx. 2,500 species of mosquitoes, gnats, sandflies, and Ixodid, Argasid, and Gamasid ticks. The trophic relationships of arbovirus vectors with birds are considerably lower than those of mammals. Apparently, no more than 500 species of bloodsuckers in this category are associated with birds. The most numerous relationships with this group of vertebrates are found in Argasid mosquitoes and ticks. Mosquitoes of the genus Deinocerites, some sandflies of the genus Sergentomyia, and all Ixodid ticks of the genus Aponoma show close reptilia reptilla trophic relationships. The total number of arbovirus vector species parasitizing reptiles does not exceed 50. Ecologically, 212 arboviruses can be called mammalian viruses, 39 avian viruses, and 3 reptilian arboviruses. There is a close positive correlation (coefficient 0.90) between the number of vectors related trophically to one or another group of terrestrial vertebrates and the number of arboviruses specific to this group. Most arboviruses occur on one continent, but spread across two or three continents if they have continental connections (North and South America, Africa, and Eurasia). Arboviruses found in the western and eastern hemispheres are ecologically associated with man (dengue 2 and 3, yellow fever), domestic animals (sheep bluetongue, Wad Medani), or with migratory birds and their specific parasites (Tyuleniy virus). .

390,Metasecretome-selective phage display approach to extract the functional potential of a rumen microbial community,"BACKGROUND: In silico, secretome proteins can be predicted from fully sequenced genomes using several available algorithms that identify membrane-targeting sequences. For the metasecretome (a collection of surface, secreted, and transmembrane proteins from environmental microbial communities), this approach is not practical, considering that the open reading frames (ORFs) of the metasecretome comprise only 10% to 30% of the total metagenome, and are poorly represented in the dataset due to low overall coverage of the metagenomic genepool, even in large-scale projects. RESULTS: By combining secretome-selective phage display and next-generation sequencing, we focused sequence analysis of the complex rumen microbial community on the metasecretome component of the metagenome. This approach achieved a high (29-fold) enrichment of fibrolytic enzymes secreted from the plant-adherent microbial community of the bovine rumen. In particular, we identified hundreds of hitherto rare modules belonging to cellulosomes, cell surface complexes specialized for plant fiber recognition and degradation. CONCLUSIONS: As a method, metasecretome phage display combined with next-generation sequencing has the power to sample the diversity of low-abundance secreted and surface proteins that would otherwise require exceptionally large metagenomic sequencing projects. As a resource, the metasecretome display library supported by the next-generation sequencing dataset is ready for i) affinity selection using standard phage display methodology and ii) easy purification of the displayed proteins as part of the virion for individual functional analysis.",,"Ciric, M.;Moon, C.

BVDV is an RNA virus with high genomic variability that has practical consequences in epidemiology, diagnosis, and disease control. Genetic monitoring was suggested as the first step in BVDV control. Thirty-seven bovine viral diarrhea viruses were identified in persistently infected cattle, animals affected by mucosal diseases, and in bulk milk, and genetically characterized. The 5-UTR region was amplified and sequenced, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed comparing all Italian BVDV sequences available in the Genbank database. An unusual number of persistently infected animals were found in more than one farm.

392,Evidence of the presence of Tunisian-type pestiviruses in small ruminants in Italy since 2007,"The Pestivirus genus, which belongs to the Flaviviridae family, includes ssRNA+ viruses responsible for infectious diseases in pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, and other domestic and wild ruminants. Like most RNA viruses, pestiviruses have high genomic variability with practical consequences for epidemiology, diagnosis, and disease control. In addition to the officially recognized species of the Pestivirus genus, such as BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BDV and CSFV, other pestiviruses have been detected. Furthermore, most ruminant pestiviruses show little or no species specificity observed in serological tests and are capable of infecting multiple species. Small ruminants in particular are receptive hosts to the more heterogeneous group of pestiviruses. The aim of this study was to carry out the molecular characterization of pestiviruses isolated from sheep and goats in Sicily, Italy. Phylogenetic analysis of two viral genomic regions (a 5'-UTR fragment and the complete Npro regions) revealed the presence of different pestivirus genotypes in the analyzed goat and sheep herds. Two of five viral isolates clustered with BVDV-1d virus, a strain widespread in Italy but never reported in Sicily. The other three isolates formed a distinct group with a high similarity to the Tunisian isolates, recently proposed as a new pestivirus species. This represents the first evidence of the presence of Tunisian-type pestiviruses in small ruminants in Italy. In addition, one of the isolates was obtained from a goat, representing the first Tunisian-type pestivirus isolation of this species.",,"Ciulli, S.;Purpari, G.;Agnello, S.;Di Marco, P.;Di Bella, S.;Volpe, E.;Mira, F.;de Aguiar Saldanha Pinheiro, A.

393,Correlates of protection against human rotavirus disease and factors influencing protection in low-income settings.,"Rotaviruses (RVs) are the leading cause of gastroenteritis in infants and children worldwide and are associated with high mortality predominantly in low-income settings. The virus is classified into serotypes G and P and further into genotypes P based on differences in surface-exposed VP7 and VP4 proteins, respectively. Infection results in a variable level of protection against subsequent reinfection and disease. This protection is predominantly homotypic in some settings, while broader heterotypic protection is reported in other cohorts. Two antigenically distinct oral antiretroviral vaccines are licensed and are being widely deployed, including in resource-poor settings, with funding provided by the GAVI alliance. The former is a monovalent vaccine derived from a live attenuated human strain of RV, while the latter is a pentavalent bovine-human reassortant vaccine. Both vaccines are highly effective in high-income settings, but very low levels of protection are reported in low-income countries. Here, current challenges facing mucosal immunologists and vaccinologists are considered with the goal of defining immunological correlates and understanding the varying levels of protection conferred by these vaccines in humans. Such an understanding is critical for maximizing the public health impact of current vaccines and also for the development of the next generation of RV vaccines, which are needed.",,"Clarke, E.;Desselberger, U.",2015.0,,10.1038/mi.2014.114,0

This analysis showed that while mobility variations were always associated with detectable nucleotide sequence changes, sequence changes at least as large as those found in segments showing electrophoretic mobility variations were also detected in segments showing no electrophoretic mobility variation. mobility. Evidence for the occurrence of genome segment rearrangement among viruses in the field was obtained by analyzing RNAs from species 11 of these five isolates. The general conclusion from these results is that great care is required in interpreting simple genome profile analysis of different isolates for epidemiological purposes and that classification of these viruses solely on the basis of genome electropherotype could be misleading.",,"Clarke, I.

The two Hong Kong strains could be easily distinguished from the earlier A(2) strains by the resistance of their hemagglutinins to trypsin treatment and their failure to regain hemagglutinating capacity after dithiothreitol was removed from the treated virus preparations. In these respects, the equine strain more closely resembled the Hong Kong variants. The hemagglutination inactivation pattern also differentiated the swine, PR8, and CAME strains from each other, as well as from the other five strains. The results suggest that the separation of type A viruses into groups by the inactivation pattern of their hemagglutinins may be a valuable adjunct to standard serology for a more defined classification of these viruses.",,"Cleeland, R.;Grunberg, E.;Prince, H.

397,"complex mosaic of enteroviruses shapes the transmission and course of community-acquired hand, foot, and mouth disease within a single hospital","Human enteroviruses (EVs) represent a significant risk to public health. This is especially true in the Asia-Pacific region, where there have been an increasing number of cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and large outbreaks of serious neurological illness associated with EV-A71. Despite their importance, key aspects of the emergence, epidemiology, and evolution of electric vehicles remain unclear, and most studies of electric vehicle evolution have focused on a limited number of genes. Here, we describe the genome-wide evolution of EV-A viruses sampled from pediatric patients with mild disease attending a single hospital in western Sydney, Australia, over an 18-month period. This analysis revealed the presence of eight viral serotypes: Coxsackievirus (CV) A2, A4, A5, A6, A8, A10, A16, and EV-A71, with up to four different serotypes circulating in any given month. Despite the absence of large-scale outbreaks, high levels of geographic and temporal admixture of serotypes were identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that there were multiple strains of the same serotype present in the community, and that this diversity was shaped by multiple introductions into the Sydney population, with only a single lineage of CV-A6 exhibiting in situ transmission throughout the study period. . Genome-scale analyzes also revealed the presence of new and historic EV recombinants. Notably, our analysis revealed no association between viral phylogeny, including serotype, and patient age, sex, or disease severity (for uncomplicated disease).

398,Enhanced arbovirus surveillance with deep sequencing: identification of novel rhabdoviruses and bunyaviruses in Australian mosquitoes,"Viral metagenomics characterizes and identifies unknown viruses based on sequence similarities to any previously sequenced viral genome. A metagenomics approach was used to identify sequences of viruses in Australian mosquitoes that cause cytopathic effects in inoculated mammalian cell cultures. Sequence comparisons revealed strains of Liao Ning virus (Reovirus, Seadornavirus), previously detected only in China, Stretch Lagoon virus that infects cattle (Reovirus, Orbivirus), two new dimarhabdoviruses, called Beaumont and North Creek viruses, and two new orthobunyaviruses, called Murrumbidgee and salt ash viruses. The novel virus proteomes diverged by ‰¥50% relative to their closest previously genetically characterized viral relatives. Deep sequencing also generated genomes of Warrego and Wallal viruses, orbiviruses linked to kangaroo blindness, whose genomes had not been fully characterized. This study highlights viral metagenomics alongside traditional arbovirus surveillance to characterize new and known arboviruses in field-collected mosquitoes.

399,Characterization of ncRNA in human pathogenic protists using high-throughput sequencing technology,"ncRNAs are key genes in many human diseases, including cancer and viral infections, as well as providing critical functions in pathogenic organisms such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, and protists. Until now, identification and characterization of disease-associated ncRNAs has been slow or imprecise, requiring many years of testing to understand the complicated relationships between protein genes and RNAs. High-throughput sequencing now offers the opportunity to characterize miRNAs, siRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and long ncRNAs at the genome scale, making it faster and easier to clarify how these ncRNAs contribute to disease state. However, this technology is still relatively new and ncRNA discovery is not a high priority application for optimized bioinformatics. Here we summarize basic concepts and practical approaches to ncRNA analysis by high-throughput sequencing and how it relates to understanding human disease. As a case study, we focus on the parasitic protists Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis, where the great evolutionary distance has meant difficulties in comparing the ncRNAs with those of model eukaryotes. A combination of biological, computational, and sequencing approaches has allowed easier classification of ncRNA classes as snoRNAs, but has also helped identify novel classes. It is hoped that a higher level of understanding of ncRNA expression and interaction may aid in the development of less severe treatment for protist-based diseases.",,"Collins, L. J.",2011.0,,,0
400,"The recently identified flavivirus, Bamaga virus, is horizontally transmitted by Culex mosquitoes and interferes with in vitro replication and in vivo transmission of West Nile virus.","Arthropod-borne flaviviruses, such as yellow fever viruses (YFV), Zika, and dengue, continue to cause significant human disease worldwide. These viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes when a female ingests an infected blood meal from a viremic vertebrate host and expectorates virus from a subsequent host. Bamaga virus (BgV) is a recently discovered flavivirus in mosquitoes of the Culex sitiens subgroup collected from Cape York Peninsula, Australia. This virus clusters phylogenetically with the YFV group, but is potentially restricted to most vertebrates. However, high levels of replication in an opossum cell line (OK) indicate a potential association with marsupials. To determine whether BgV could be horizontally transmitted by mosquitoes, vectorial competition between two members of the Cx. subgroup sitians, Cx. annulirostris and Cx. sitiens, for BgV was investigated. Eleven to thirteen days after ingesting an infectious blood meal, infection rates were 11.3% and 18.8% for Cx. annulirostris and Cx. sites, respectively. Cx. annulirostris transmitted virus at low levels (5.6% had positive saliva for BgV overall); Cx. sitians did not transmit the virus. When mosquitoes were injected with BgV intraracially, the infection and transmission rates were 100% and 82%, respectively, for both species. These results provided evidence for the first time that BgV can be transmitted horizontally by Cx. annulirostris, the main vector of pathogenic zoonotic flaviviruses in Australia. We also evaluated whether BgV could interfere with in vitro replication and in vivo infection and transmission of superinfecting Culex-associated pathogenic flaviviruses. BgV significantly reduced the growth of Murray Valley and West Nile encephalitis viruses (WNV) in vitro. While prior infection with BgV by injection did not inhibit WNV superinfection of Cx. annulirostris, significantly fewer BgV-infected mosquitoes could transmit WNV than sham-injected mosquitoes. Overall, these data contribute to our understanding of flavivirus ecology, Australian mosquito modes of transmission, and interference mechanisms of superinfections.",,"Colmant, A. M.

401,Viromes as a genetic reservoir for microbial communities in aquatic environments: a focus on antimicrobial resistance genes,"Although studies of virome isolated from aquatic environments are becoming more frequent, most of them are limited to the characterization of viral taxonomy. Bacterial reads in viromes are abundant, but the extent to which this genetic material is playing a role in the ecology of aquatic microbiology remains unclear. To this end, we developed a useful approach for the characterization of viral and microbial communities in aquatic environments with a particular focus on the identification of microbial genes harbored in viromes. Virus-like particles were isolated from water samples collected along the Lambro River, from the spring to the urbanized area of Milan. Derived viromes were analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing for the presence and relative abundance of bacterial genes with a particular focus on those genes involved in antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes have been identified in all virome samples along with a large number of reads mapped to cellular processes and signaling. Virome data compared to those identified in the microbiome isolated from the same sample revealed differences in terms of functional categories and their relative abundance. To verify the role of the aquatic viral population in bacterial gene transfer, water-based mesocosms were perturbed or undisturbed with a low dose of tetracycline. The results obtained by the qPCR assays revealed a variation in the abundance of tet genes in the virome and the microbiome, which highlights a relevant role of viral populations in the mobilization of microbial genes.",,"Colombo, S.;Arioli, S.;Neri, E.;Della Scala, G.;Gargari, G.;Mora, D.",2017.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2017.01095,0

403,Identification of a recombinant enterovirus with torovirus-like gene insertion during an outbreak of diarrhea in fattening pigs,"Diarrhea outbreaks on pig farms have caused great concern in Europe and the US as they can lead to dramatic losses of pigs. During a suspected outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in Belgium, we performed viral metagenomics to assess other potential viral pathogens. Although PEDV was detected, its low abundance indicated that other viruses were involved in the outbreak. Interestingly, a porcine bocavirus and several enteroviruses were the most abundant in the sample. We also observed the presence of a porcine enterovirus genome with a gene insertion, resembling a C28 peptidase gene found in toroviruses, which was confirmed using resequencing, bioinformatics, and proteomics approaches. Furthermore, the predicted cleavage sites for the insertion suggest that this gene was expressed as a single protein, rather than a fused protein. Recombination in enteroviruses has been reported to be an important mechanism for generating genetic diversity, but gene insertions in viral families are rare. Although such interfamilial recombinations are rare, our finding suggests that these events may contribute significantly to viral evolution.",,"Conceicao-Neto, N.;Theuns, S.;Cui, T.;Zeller, M.;Yinda, C.

406,Hepatitis E virus is prevalent in the pig population of the Lao People's Democratic Republic and there is evidence of homogeneity with Chinese Genotype 4 human isolates.,"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and genotypic range of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in the pig population of northern Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). We collected 181 fecal samples from landrace pigs ‰¤ 6 months of age and the feces were stored in RNA stabilization buffer due to cold chain and transport limitations. Twenty-one pigs (11.6%) had detectable HEV RNA and 43.5% of the herds in the village were infected.

407,Highly divergent hepaciviruses of African cattle,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV; genus Hepacivirus) is a highly relevant human pathogen. Single hepaciviruses (HV) have recently been discovered in animal hosts. The direct ancestor of HCV has not been found, but the most closely related genetically animal HVs exist in horses. To investigate whether other peridomestic animals also carry HV, we analyzed Ghanaian cattle sera for HV by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Nine of 106 specimens from different sampling sites contained HV RNA (8.5%) with median viral loads of 1.6 × 105 copies/mL. The infection appeared to be unrelated to the age and sex of the cattle. Near-complete sequencing of the genome of five representative viruses confirmed the taxonomic classifications. Cattle HVs formed two distinct phylogenetic lineages that differed by up to 17.7% at the nucleotide level in the polyprotein coding region, suggesting co-circulation of different virus subtypes. A conserved microRNA122 binding site at the 5' internal ribosomal entry site suggested liver tropism of cattle HV. Phylogenetic analyzes suggested HV circulation in cattle for several centuries. Cattle HVs were genetically highly divergent from all other HVs, including HCV. HVs from genetically related equine and bovine hosts were not monophyletic, corroborating host changes during the evolution of the Hepacivirus genus. Similar to equine HVs, the genetic diversity of bovine HVs was low compared to that of HCV genotypes. This suggests an influence of the human-modified ecology of peridomestic animals on virus diversity. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the occurrence of HV in cattle in other geographic areas and breeds, the pathogenicity of the virus in cattle, and the potential exposure of human risk groups such as farmers, butchers, and slaughterhouse workers.",,"Corman, V.

409,Heterosubtypic neutralizing antibodies are produced by individuals immunized with a seasonal influenza vaccine.,"The target of neutralizing antibodies that protect against influenza virus infection is the viral protein HA. Genetic and antigenic variation in HA has been used to classify influenza viruses into subtypes (H1-H16). The neutralizing antibody response to influenza virus is believed to be specific for some antigenically related isolates within a given subtype. However, although heterosubtypic antibodies capable of neutralizing multiple influenza virus subtypes have recently been isolated from phage display libraries, it is not known whether such antibodies are produced in the course of an immune response to influenza virus infection. from the flu or the vaccine. Here we report that, after vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine containing influenza virus subtypes H1 and H3, some individuals produce antibodies that cross-react with H5 HA. By immortalizing IgG-expressing B cells from 4 individuals, we isolated 20 heterosubtypic mAbs that bound and neutralized viruses belonging to several HA subtypes (H1, H2, H5, H6, and H9), including pandemic A/California/07/09 H1N1 isolate. The mAbs utilized different VH genes and carried a high frequency of somatic mutations. With the exception of one mAb that bound to the globular head of HA, all of the heterosubtypic mAbs bound to acid-sensitive epitopes on the stem region of HA. Four mAbs were tested in vivo and protected mice against challenge with representative influenza viruses of different subtypes. These findings reveal that seasonal influenza vaccination can induce polyclonal heterosubtypic neutralizing antibodies that cross-react with pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses of swine origin and highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses.",,"Corti, D.;Suguitan Jr, A.

Part of the 5"" untranslated region and the 5"" end of the gp53(E2) coding sequence were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the field isolates segregated into genotypes Ib or II. Only one of the 28 field isolates belonged to genotype Ia. Interestingly, some type I strains were equally divergent from type Ia and Ib strains and grouped into additional subtypes within genotype I. Immune sera from young calves experimentally inoculated with field isolates first identified on the basis of their sequences in two-way neutralization experiments. . The results clearly differentiated type I from type II strains, although some degree of cross-neutralization was observed. Within type I, the new groups could not be differentiated antigenically from the more prevalent type Ib strains or from the NADL type Ia strain, suggesting that BVDV genotype I is antigenically homogeneous.

412,Animal genomics in natural reservoirs of infectious diseases,"Natural virus reservoirs, such as wild bats, birds, rodents, and nonhuman primates, are generally non-model organisms that, until recently, presented limited opportunities for in-depth study. Next-generation sequencing provides a way to partially circumvent this limitation, as the methods required for data acquisition and analysis are largely species-independent. Comparative genomics and other ""omics"" provide new opportunities to study the structure and function of various biological systems of wild species that would otherwise be beyond our reach. Genomes of natural reservoir hosts can help identify the dominant pathways of virus-host interaction and reveal differences between susceptible and resistant organisms, populations, and species. This is of great scientific interest and may also provide a resource for the rational design of treatments for viral diseases in humans and cattle. In this way, we will 'learn from nature' and one day apply this knowledge to create disease-resistant cattle or develop new prevention and therapeutic strategies. Reservoir host genomics will also open up possibilities for developing new vaccines for wildlife, aid in the development of new diagnostic platforms, and have broad implications for developmental and evolutionary biology. In this review, the authors focus on natural reservoirs of viral pathogens, although most of the discussion points should be equally applicable to natural reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria, fungi, or other parasites.",,"Cowled, C.;Wang, L.

Although pigs are the natural host for pseudorabies virus (PRV), the virus has a wide host range and can cause fatal encephalitis in many species. The United States achieved PRV-free status in 2004 after the virus was eradicated from domestic pig farmers, but the virus is still present in feral pig populations. The current report describes PRV infection in 3 dogs that were used to hunt wild pigs. The dogs developed clinical signs that included facial itching with facial abrasions, dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea, ataxia, muscle rigidity, and death. Two were sacrificed and 1 died within approximately 48 hours after the onset of clinical signs. The salient histologic changes consisted of neutrophilic trigeminal ganglioneuritis with neuronophagia and equivocal intranuclear inclusion bodies. Pseudorabies virus was isolated from fresh tissues of 2 of the dogs, and immunohistochemistry detected virus in the third dog. Sequencing and phylogeny of the virus, based on available GenBank sequences, revealed that the virus was likely a field strain that was closely related to a group of PRV strains previously identified in Illinois. Although eradicated from domestic pigs in the United States, PRV is present in feral swine populations and therefore should continue to be considered a possible cause of disease in dogs and other domestic animals with compatible history and clinical signs.

417,Main molecular aspects of human coronaviruses and homologies with animal coronavirus strains,"Starting in 1965, after the discovery of several new human respiratory pathogens, a group of viruses began to emerge, which had been known since 1937, although not under the name of coronaviruses. Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and some recently described human respiratory viruses, designated OC43 and 229E, were found to have similar appearances. These viruses displayed a characteristic stripe of large, distinctive, petal-shaped peplomeres or spikes that resembled a crown. They were named 'coronavirus' after this feature. Shortly thereafter, several new viruses that cause illness in pigs, rats, turkeys, dogs, cats, and cattle were added to the group of coronaviruses. The variety of infected animal species and the multiplicity of organ systems involved have made Coronaviridae one of the most important viral families in veterinary medicine. The two human coronaviruses (HCVs) HCV-OC43 and HCV-229E belong to different antigenic groups. HCV-OC43 shares antigenic correlation with neonatal calf diarrhea coronavirus (NCDCV), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), and MHV. HCV-229E is antigenically related to porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and canine coronavirus (CCV). The coronaviruses, as a group, contain a 27 to 31 kb positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome with an estimated molecular weight of 6 x 106 to 8 x 106 daltons. In infected cells, the viral RNA genome is first transcribed into a full-length negative-strand RNA which, in turn, is transcribed into a positive-sense genomic RNA and six to eight subgenomic mRNAs by a primed transcription mechanism. by leader.",,"Cristallo, A.;Gambaro, F.;Battaglia, M.;Cereda, P.

The progeny were tested both in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and in tissue culture for resistance to representative viruses of the tentatively defined subgroups A, B and C. The segregation ratios of resistance to subgroups A and B viruses were consistent with the previously suggested hypothesis of single autosomal recessive genes controlling resistance to each subgroup. Mixed infection in CAM and replicated plaque infection in tissue culture with subgroup A and B viruses showed that resistance to subgroups A and B was inherited independently. Assays with viruses tentatively classified as subgroup C indicated that they were largely composed of a mixture of viruses from subgroups A and B or of particles possessing the host range specificity of both.

However, the evolution and pathogenicity of the H3 avian influenza virus (AIV) circulating in domestic birds in China remain unclear. In this study, seven H3 AIVs (four H3N2 and three H3N8) were isolated from poultry in the live bird market (LPM) in China. Phylogenetic analyzes of the whole genomes showed that all viruses clustered in the Eurasian lineage, except that the N8 genes of two H3N8 isolates fell into the North American lineage. Interestingly, the N8 gene of one H3N8 and PB2, PB1, NP, and NS of two H3N2 isolates have a close relationship with those of highly pathogenic H5N8 viruses circulating in Korea and the United States, suggesting that H3-like AIV may contribute internal genes to the highly pathogenic H5N8 viruses. The HA gene phylogenetic tree and antigenic cross-reactivity results indicated that two antigenically different H3 viruses are circulating in LPM in China. Most of the H3 viruses replicated in the lung and nasal turbinate of naïve mice, and representative H3 viruses infected chickens without causing clinical signs.

The CKE93 and CKE96 viruses were classified as Genotype 4. Genotypes 1-3 correspond to the HA gene-containing viruses of clade 2.3.2, and Genotype 4 is the HA gene-bearing virus of clade 7.2. To better understand the pathogenicity and transmission of the viruses, we infected chickens with 103 EID50/0.1 ml of either GSE43 (clade 2.3.2) or CKE93 (clade 7.2) virus. Our results revealed that 6 of 7 specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens inoculated with GSE43 virus were dead within 7 days post-infection, but all SPF chickens inoculated with CKE93 virus survived infection. Both GSE43 and CKE93 viruses replicated systemically in chickens. The virus titers of the GSE43 virus in the analyzed organs were obviously higher than those of the CKE93 virus. Our results revealed that the pathogenicity and replication of GSE43 in chickens was much higher than that of CKE93. The GSE43 virus could be transmitted between chickens, but CKE93 could not be transmitted between chickens by naive contact. Therefore, different clades of H5N1 AIVs possessed variable pathogenicity and transmission capabilities between chickens.

The virus, named human respiratory-associated PSCV-5-like virus (HRAPLV), has a genome comprising 3018 bases, with two major putative ORFs that reverse encode capsid protein (Cap) and replicase (Rep). and are separated by two intergenic regions. A stem-loop structure was predicted in the largest intergenic region (LIR). The predicted amino acid sequences of the HRAPLV Cap and Rep proteins showed the highest identity with those of the CP3 isolate of porcine faeces-associated circular virus 5 (PoSCV 5) (53.0% and 48.9%, respectively). The host tropism of the virus is unknown, and further studies are warranted to determine whether this new virus is associated with human disease.",,"Cui, L.;Wu, B.;Zhu, X.;Guo, X.;Ge, Y.;Zhao, K.;Qi, X.;Shi, Z.;Zhu, F.;Sun, L.;Zhou, M.",2017.0,,10.1007/s00705-017-3481-3,0
422,Analysis of microRNA expression profiles in DEF cells infected with duck Tembusu virus,"Duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV), belonging to the Flaviviridae family, is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Since April 2010, the DTMUV outbreak in China's southeastern provinces has caused heavy economic losses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important regulatory roles in viral infection by binding to host target genes or viral genomes. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of virus-host interaction, here we identify miRNA expression profiles in DTMUV-infected and uninfected DEF cells by high-throughput sequencing. A total of 287 known and 63 new miRNAs were identified. 48 miRNAs, including 26 known miRNAs and 22 novel miRNAs, were differentially expressed in response to DTMUV infection. Among these miRNAs, 37 miRNAs were upregulated and 11 miRNAs were downregulated. 9 miRNAs were randomly selected for validation by qRT-PCR experiment. The results of the qRT-PCR experiment were consistent with the sequencing data. GO enrichment showed that the predicted targets of these differentially expressed miRNAs were mainly involved in the regulation of the immune system, cellular process, and metabolic process. Analysis of KEGG pathways showed that predicted target genes were involved in several signaling pathways, such as Wnt signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, and FoxO signaling pathway. This is the first study to assess changes in miRNA expression in DEF cells after DTMUV infection. Our findings provide important clues to better understand DTMUV-host interaction.",,"Cui, M.;Jia, R.;Huang, J.;Wu, X.;Hu, Z.;Zhang, X.;Wang, M.;Zhu, D.;Chen, S.;Liu, M.;Zhao, X.;Wu, Y.;Yang, Q.;Zhang, S.;Liu, Y.;Zhang, L.;Yin, Z.;Jing, B.;Cheng, A.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2018.05.020,0

424,Precision Surveillance of Viral Respiratory Pathogens: Virome Capture Sequencing for Detection and Genomic Characterization of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections in Uganda,"Background: Precision public health is a novel set of methods for targeting disease prevention and mitigation interventions to high-risk subpopulations. We apply a precision public health strategy for SARI syndromic surveillance in Uganda by combining spatiotemporal analysis with genome sequencing to detect and characterize viral respiratory pathogens with epidemic potential. Methods: Using a national surveillance network, we identified unexplained influenza-negative SARI patients between 2010 and 2015. Spatiotemporal analyzes were performed retrospectively to identify clusters of unexplained SARIs. Within groups, respiratory viruses were detected and characterized in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples using a new oligonucleotide probe capture (VirCapSeq-VERT) and high-throughput sequencing platform. The link with conventional epidemiological strategies further characterized the transmission dynamics of the identified pathogens. Results: Among 2,901 unexplained SARI cases, 9 clusters were detected, representing 301 (10.4%) cases. Cumulus clouds were more likely to occur in urban areas and during bi-annual rainy seasons. Within the clusters detected, we identified an unrecognized outbreak of SARI associated with measles; sequence analysis implicated co-circulation of endemic genotype B3 and genotype D4 probably imported from England. We also detected a cluster of nosocomial SARIs likely associated with a new picobirnavirus more closely related to swine and camel viruses. Conclusions: Using a precision approach to public health surveillance, we detected and characterized the genomics of zoonotic and vaccine-preventable respiratory viruses associated with clusters of severe respiratory infections in Uganda. Future studies are needed to assess the feasibility, scalability, and impact of applying similar approaches during real-time public health surveillance in low-income settings.",,"Cummings, M.

Although it persisted through the 19th century, this common view was all but forgotten by the early 20th century. It is now experiencing a renaissance, coinciding with an awakening to the role evolutionary biology plays in human and animal health, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Several STIs in humans have comparable infections in animals; Similarly, both humans and animals have STIs unique to each group of mammals.

Neutralization tests were used to classify these viruses into four serotypes with isolates D'Aguilar B8112, CSIRO 11, CSIRO 58, and CSIRO 82 as type strains. The last three were new to Australia. Like other orbiviruses, these four serotypes were partially sensitive to chloroform treatment. Neutralizing antibodies against D'Aguilar, CSIRO 11, and CSIRO 58 viruses were detected in bovine, buffalo, deer, and sheep sera, but not in human, horse, pig, or marsupial sera. Antibodies against CSIRO 82 virus were detected in 85% of 26 buffalo and 0.4% of 495 bovine sera tested. The distribution of antibodies in Australia for D'Aguilar, CSIRO 11 and CSIRO 58 viruses was within the distribution limits of Culicoides brevitarsis, the insect from which these viruses were most commonly recovered. The distribution of antibodies to CSIRO 82 virus, which was isolated from a pool containing C. schultzei and C. peregrinus, was within the much more restricted distributional limits of these species.

427,Third Genome Size Category of Avian Paramyxovirus Serotype 1 (Newcastle Disease Virus) and Evolutionary Implications,"The aim of the study was to establish whether there was a relationship between the molecular patterns and the evolution of the virus. Thus, the complete genome sequence of two distinct strains of apathogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was determined and a third genome size category was recognized, containing 15,198 nucleotides. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two major splits occurred during the history of NDV, resulting in three genome size categories. An ancient split in the primordial reservoir (wild waterfowl species) led to two sister basal clades, class I and II, with genome sizes of 15,198 (due to a 12-nucleotide insertion in the phosphoprotein gene) and 15 186 nucleotides, respectively. The ancestors of only class II viruses colonized populations of chickens and subsequently developed into virulent forms. These occurred more than once and resulted in an early lineage [including genotypes I-IV and H33(W)] with a genome size of 15,186 nucleotides. A second division occurred in the 20th century in the secondary host (chicken). This resulted in branching of a clade (including recent genotypes V-VIII consisting only of pathogenic viruses) with concomitant insertion of six nucleotides into the 5â€² non-coding region of the nucleoprotein gene, thus increasing the size of the clade. genome at 15,192 nucleotides. © 2006 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"CzeglÃ©di, A.;UjvÃ¡ri, D.;Somogyi, E.;Wehmann, E.;Werner, O.;Lomniczi, B.",2006.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2005.11.009,0

The program culminated in the elimination of the disease, one of the most important achievements of modern medicine. Interestingly, one of the key factors in the success of the vaccination campaign, the VACV virus itself, is not well understood in relation to its natural reservoirs, evolutionary history, and origins, and is often considered extinct as a natural virus. However, orthopoxviruses other than smallpox virus have been known to circulate in Brazil since the early 1960s. More specifically, VVAC has been associated with naturally acquired infections in humans, cattle, and possibly other reservoirs since 1999, when bovine vaccinia outbreaks began to be reported year after year. In this article, we list and discuss the most important VVAC outbreaks that have occurred in Brazil in the last 20 years.

432,A fatal case of lupa disease in a dog: immunolocalization and complete sequencing of the virus genome,"Lupa disease (LI), caused by the lupa disease virus (LIV), causes a frequently fatal encephalitis that primarily affects sheep and capercaillie (Lagopus lagopus scotica), but occurs in other species. An adult male border collie dog was definitively diagnosed with fatal LI and the lesion profile, LIV antigen distribution and the complete genome sequence of the responsible LIV were investigated to determine if this differed significantly from sheep-derived LIV. No macroscopic lesions were observed. Histologic lesions were confined to the central nervous system and included lymphocytic perivascular cuffing, glial foci, neuronal necrosis, and neuronophagia. Immunolocalization of viral antigen showed small amounts present only in neurons. These histological and immunohistochemical findings were similar to those reported in affected sheep. Compared to the published full genome sequences of sheep-derived LIV, only very minor differences were observed and, phylogenetically, the virus clustered individually between a subclade containing Scottish strains, LIV 369/T2 and G, and another subclade containing a English isolate LIV A. LIV isolated from the dog shares a common parent with LIV A. These findings suggest that there is no canine-specific LIV strain, dogs are susceptible to sheep-associated LI strains, and with the increase in the prevalence of ticks and thus exposure to LIV, a safe strain, an effective vaccine for dogs may be necessary.",,"Dagleish, M.

Because no information exists on the evolution of TMUV, we performed comprehensive phylogenetic analyzes using the largest collection of complete TMUV open reading frame (ORF) sequences. Our results indicated that two virus lineages were associated with the 2010 outbreak in China, with lineage II, in particular sublineage II-c, emerging as the dominant lineage currently circulating. We infer that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of this TMUV arose around 1996. Evidence for natural recombination was also detected in TMUV. Molecular fitness analyzes revealed that strong negative selection shaped the evolution of TMUV, while several codons subject to positive pressure were also identified.

434,Next generation sequencing strategies to characterize the turkey genome,"The turkey genome sequencing project began in 2008 and has relied primarily on next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Our early efforts used a synergistic combination of 2 NGS platforms (Roche/454 and Illumina GAII), detailed bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) maps, and unique assembly tools to sequence and assemble the genome of the domesticated turkey, Meleagris gallopavo. Since the first launch in 2010, efforts continue to improve genome assembly, gene annotation, and genomic analyses. The initial assembly build (2.01) represented approximately 89% of the genome sequence at 17X depth of coverage (931 Mb). Sequence contigs were assigned to 30 of the 40 chromosomes with approximately 10% of the assembled sequence corresponding to unassigned chromosomes (ChrUn). The sequence was refined through genome-wide and area-focused sequencing, including paired-end and shotgun sequencing, and targeted sequencing of chromosomal regions with low or incomplete coverage. These additional efforts have improved sequence assembly, resulting in 2 subsequent genomic builds of greater genomic coverage (25X/Build3.0 and 30X/Build4.0) with the current sequence totaling 1010 Mb. In addition, BAC with final sequences assigned to chromosomes Z/W and MG18 (MHC), ChrUn, or not placed in the previous build, were isolated, deep sequenced (Hi-Seq), and incorporated in the most recent build (5.0). To aid in annotation and generate a gene expression atlas of major tissues, a comprehensive set of RNA samples at various stages of development were collected from male and female turkeys. The transcriptome sequencing data (using Illumina Hi-Seq) will provide information to improve final assembly and ultimately improve sequence annotation. The most current sequence covers more than 95% of the turkey genome and should yield a much better level of genetic annotation, making it a valuable resource for studying genetic variations underlying economically important traits in poultry.",,"Dalloul, R.

However, information on the genetic characteristics of Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) circulating in commercial chickens and wild birds is scarce. In this study, we characterized isolates obtained from suspected ND outbreaks during 2012-2014 from poultry farms (n = 8) and feral pigeons (n = 4). NDV isolated from pathological specimens, by inoculation into embryonated chicken eggs, were characterized biologically by conventional intracerebral pathogenicity indices (ICPI) and genetically on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences of the F gene (260 bp) spanning the site of excision ICPI values of chicken isolates ranged from 0.9 to 1.8; while the ICPI of pigeon isolates was 1.4. All isolates contained multiple basic amino acids at the deduced cleavage site of the fusion protein, which is a typical feature of virulent viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial cleavage site of the F gene (260 bp) indicated that all virus sequences obtained from pigeons were identical and clustered within the hIV genotype, while virus sequences obtained from chickens clustered within the fIV genotype. The similarity between the viruses obtained from chickens and those obtained from pigeons ranged from 82.5 to 85.6%. This suggests that different subgenotypes of genotype VI circulate in the population of feral chickens and pigeons in Ethiopia. This warrants further study to understand the role of wild birds in the epidemiology of NDV in Ethiopia and also highlights the importance of continued surveillance in both wild birds and domestic poultry.",,"Damena, D.;Fusaro, A.;Sombo, M.;Belaineh, R.;Heidari, A.;Kebede, A.;Kidane, M.;Chaka, H.",2016.0,,,0

PCR screening of organ samples from pigs suspected of being affected by PMWS or PDNS revealed the presence of PCV-2 in 80% of cases. Six PCV-2 genomes from Hungarian isolates were completely sequenced. Phylogenetic comparison with all available PCV-2 sequences showed that circulating porcine circoviruses in Hungary are more variable than in several other European countries.

All PaPV are zoonotic and can infect humans after direct or indirect contact with infected animals. Here we report the development and validation of a highly sensitive real-time PCR assay for the rapid detection of PaPV. The new assay (referred to as the RVSS assay) was specific only for PaPVs and did not cross-react with other poxviruses. Using a recombinant plasmid as a positive control, the analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined to be 16 copies of the PaPV genome per assay. The estimate of the amplification efficiency (91-99%), the estimate of the intra-assay and inter-assay variability (standard deviation [SD]: 0.28-1.06 and 0.01-0.14, respectively) and the estimate of operator variability (SD: 0.78 between laboratories and 0.28 between operators within a laboratory) were within the acceptable range. Diagnostic specificity was evaluated on 100 samples from healthy normal animals and all but 1 were negative (99%). Diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) was evaluated in 77 clinical samples (skin/mange) from infected sheep, goats and cattle, and all were positive (100%). The assay was multiplexed with beta-actin as internal positive control and the multiplex assay showed the same DSe as the singleplex assay. Further characterization of PaPV samples by species-specific real-time PCR and nucleotide sequencing of PCR products after conventional PCR showed the presence of Orf virus not only in sheep and goats but also in 1 bovine. The validated RVSS assay demonstrated high specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and robustness, which are critical for PaPV detection in the laboratory.",,"Das, A.;Ward, G.;Lowe, A.;Xu, L.;Moran, K.;Renshaw, R.;Dubovi, E.;Reising, M.;Jia, W.",2017.0,,10.1177/1040638716680676,0

446,Frog adenovirus DNA sequence,"The frog adenovirus (FrAdV-1) genome was sequenced and found to be the smallest of all known adenovirus genomes. The obtained sequence was 26,163 bp in size and contains a substantial direct repeat near the right end, implying that it was derived by recombination from a parental genome of only 25,517 bp. The closest relative of FrAdV-1 turned out to be turkey adenovirus 3, an avian adenovirus with no previously known close relative. Sequence comparisons showed that the two viruses have equivalent gene complements, including a gene whose product is related to sialidases. Phylogenetic analyzes supported the establishment of a fourth adenovirus genus containing these two viruses, in addition to the established genera Mastadenovirus and Aviadenovirus and the proposed genus Atadenovirus. Sixteen conserved genes were identified among these four lineages and were presumably inherited from an ancestral adenovirus.",,"Davison, A. J.;Wright, K. M.;Harrach, B.",2000.0,,,0
447,Metagenomic analysis of the turkey gut RNA virus community,"Viral enteric disease is a continuing economic burden on poultry producers around the world, and despite considerable research, no single virus has emerged as a possible causative agent and target of prevention and control efforts. Historically, electron microscopy has been used to identify suspect viruses, with many small, round viruses eluding classification based on morphology alone. National and regional surveys using molecular diagnostics have revealed that suspect viruses circulate continuously in poultry in the United States, with many viruses appearing concomitantly and in healthy birds. High-throughput nucleic acid pyrosequencing is a powerful diagnostic technology capable of determining the complete genomic repertoire present in a complex environmental sample. We used the Roche/454 Life Sciences GS-FLX platform to compile a metagenome of RNA viruses from turkey flocks experiencing enteric disease. This approach produced numerous virus-homologous sequences in the BLAST nr protein database, many of which have not been described in turkeys. Our analysis of this turkey intestine RNA metagenome focuses in particular on turkey-origin members of the Picornavirales, Caliciviridae, and turkey Picobirnaviruses. © 2010 Day et al licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Day, J.

448,Comparative Analysis of Gut Bacterial and Viral RNA Communities of Sentinel Birds Placed in Selected Broiler Farms,"There is great interest in characterizing the complex microbial communities in the bird gut and in understanding the effects of these dynamic communities on bird performance, disease status, animal welfare, and microbes of importance to human health. . Research characterizing the poultry enteric virome has identified new avian viruses, but the roles these viruses play in disease and performance problems have not yet been fully characterized. The complex bacterial community present in the bird gut influences gut development, immune status and animal health, each of which can be an indicator of overall performance. The present metagenomic investigation was carried out to provide information on the colonization of specific pathogen-free chickens by enteric microorganisms under field conditions and to compare the gut microbiome prior to contact with the microbiome altered after contact with free-range birds. Gut virome analysis of contact (""sentinel"") birds placed on the farms revealed colonization by members of the Picornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Reoviridae, and Astroviridae that were not present in the birds prior to contact or were present in proportionately lower numbers. Sentinel gut bacterial community analysis revealed a disrupted community in post-contact birds, particularly by members of the Lachnospiracea/Clostridium and Lactobacillus families and genera. Members of the avian enterics Reoviridae and Astroviridae have been well characterized and have historically been implicated in enteric disease of birds; members of the Picobirnaviridae and Picornaviridae have recently been described in poultry and in the avian gut, and their roles in recognized disease syndromes and overall bird performance have not been determined. This metagenomic analysis has provided insights into the colonization of the poultry gut by enteric microbes circulating in commercial broiler flocks, and has identified enteric viruses and virus communities that warrant further study to understand their status.

449,Molecular and phylogenetic analysis of a new Picobirnavirus of Turkish origin,"An earlier metagenomic analysis of the turkey gut RNA virus community identified novel enteric viruses that may play a role in enteric diseases of birds or performance problems observed in the field. As part of the molecular characterization of these new enteric viruses, a reverse transcriptase-PCR diagnostic assay was developed, targeting a novel picobirnavirus (PBV) of turkey origin initially identified in a pooled intestinal sample from turkeys in North Carolina. Little detailed molecular information exists on the Picobirnaviridae family, particularly for PBVs that have been described in avian species. This diagnostic assay targets the turkey PBV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene and produces a 1135 bp amplicon. This assay was validated using in vitro transcribed RNA and tested using archived enteric samples collected from turkey flocks in the southeastern United States. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis suggests that the turkey PBV is unique in that it does not cluster closely with the recognized PBV genogroups that circulate in mammalian hosts. © American Association of Avian Pathologists.",,"Day, J.

450,Investigation of turkey enteric picornavirus and its association with enteric diseases in poults,Previous investigations of the viral community in the gastrointestinal tract of poultry have revealed a number of new and partially described enteric viruses. It is evident that the poultry gut viral community remains minimally characterized and incompletely understood. Research on the poultry gut microbiome has provided insights into the geographical distribution and rapidly evolving taxonomy of avian enteric picornaviruses. The present investigation was carried out to produce a comparative metagenomic analysis of the intestinal virome of a flock of healthy turkeys versus a flock placed in the field. This investigation revealed a number of enteric picornavirus sequences that were present in commercial birds in the field and completely absent in the healthy flock. A novel molecular diagnostic assay was used to track the excretion of turkey enteric picornavirus field strains in commercial poults inoculated with picornavirus-positive intestinal homogenates prepared from turkeys that were experiencing moderate enteric disease. Spread of this new enteric picornavirus in commercial poults resulted in a significant reduction in weight gain and suggests that this common inhabitant of the turkey gut may cause performance problems or enteric disease in the field.,,"Day, J.

451,Molecular characterization of enteric picornaviruses in archived turkey and chicken samples from the United States,"Recent metagenomic analyzes of enteric viromes in turkeys and chickens have revealed complex viral communities composed of multiple viral families. Of particular importance are the new avian picobirnaviruses (family Picobirnaviridae), multiple genera of tailed phages (family Siphoviridae), and undescribed enteric avian picornaviruses (family Picornaviridae). In addition to these largely undescribed and therefore relatively poorly understood families of poultry enteric viruses, these metagenomic analyzes have also revealed the presence of well-known groups of enteric viruses, such as the chicken and turkey astroviruses ( family Astroviridae) and avian rotaviruses and reoviruses (family Reoviridae). The order Picornavirales is a changing group of viruses, particularly among avian picornaviruses, as several new genera have recently been described based on community analyzes of enteric viromes from poultry and other avian species worldwide. Our previous investigation of turkey enteric picornaviruses suggests that avian enteric picornaviruses may contribute to enteric disease syndromes and performance problems often seen in turkeys in the southeastern United States. This report describes our recent phylogenetic analysis of turkey and chicken enteric samples archived at the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory from 2004 to the present and is a first step in placing these novel avian picornaviruses within the larger family Picornaviridae.",,"Day, J.

452,High global diversity of cycloviruses among dragonflies,"Members of the family Circoviridae, specifically the genus Circovirus, were thought to infect only vertebrates; however, members of a sister group of the same family, the proposed genus Cyclovirus, have recently been detected in insects. In an effort to explore the diversity of cycloviruses and better understand the evolution of these new ssDNA viruses, here we present five cycloviruses isolated from three species of dragonflies (Orthetrum sabina, Xanthocnemis zealandica, and Rhionaeschna multicolor) collected in Australia, New Zealand, and the USA. respectively. The genomes of these five viruses share a similar genomic structure to other cycloviruses, with a circular genome of ~1.7 kb and two bidirectionally transcribed major ORFs. Genomic sequence data collected during this study were combined with all available cyclovirus genomes in public databases to identify conserved motifs and regulatory elements in intergenic regions, as well as determine diversity and recombinant regions within their genomes. The genomes reported here represent four different cyclovirus species, three of which are new. Our results confirm that cycloviruses circulate widely in winged insect populations; in eight different cyclovirus species identified in dragonflies to date, some of them exhibit a wide geographic distribution. Recombination analysis revealed both intra- and interspecies recombination events among cycloviruses, including genomes recovered from disparate sources (eg, goat meat and human feces). Similar to other well-characterized circular ssDNA viruses, recombination may play an important role in the evolution of cycloviruses. © 2013 SGM.",,"Dayaram, A.;Potter, K. A.;Moline, A.

453,"Detection of hepatitis E virus in liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, serum, bile and feces of naturally infected pigs affected by different pathological conditions","The objective of the present study was to detect the hepatitis E virus (HEV) in different samples from naturally infected pigs and to genetically characterize the detected strains. Serum, bile, liver, lymph nodes and feces were collected from 69 animals from 1 week to 4 months of age with different pathological conditions. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect HEV and tissue histopathology. RT-PCR positive samples were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. HEV was detected in at least one sample in 26 of 69 animals (37.7%). Bile was the most frequent positive sample, followed by mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, feces, and serum. HEV was detected in pigs at 1 (n = 7), 2 (n = 8) and 3 (n = 11) months of age. A total of 22 of 69 (31.9%) pigs had mild to moderate hepatitis and 15 of them were RT-PCR positive for HEV in at least one of the samples tested. The highest sensitivity of viral detection was achieved using samples that cannot be obtained from live pigs, such as liver, mesenteric lymph node, and bile. Phylogenetic analyzes confirmed that all the Spanish porcine HEV strains detected belonged to genotype III. Therefore, genotype III strains are present in a relatively high proportion of pigs between 1 and 3 months of age. Through this study, it cannot be ruled out whether concomitant infections may influence the distribution of HEV in infected pigs. © 2006 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"de Deus, N.;Seminati, C.;Pina, S.;Mateu, E.;MartÃ­n, M.;SegalÃ©s, J.",2007.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.08.027,0
454,Antigenic and molecular heterogeneity in recent swine influenza A(H1N1) virus isolates with potential implications for vaccination policy,"In order to explore the occurrence of antigenic drift in swine influenza A(H1N1) viruses and overlap between epidemic and vaccine strains, 26 viruses were isolated from respiratory disease outbreaks among fattening pigs in the Netherlands in the 1995/1996 season and reference strains from previous outbreaks were examined by serological and molecular methods. Unlike porcine H3N2 viruses, no significant antigenic variation was observed in porcine H1N1 viruses isolated from the late 1980s to 1996 inclusive. However, marked genetic and antigenic heterogeneity was detected by hemagglutination inhibition tests and nucleotide sequence analyzes among the 26 recent swine H1N1 strains. Interestingly, the antigenic and molecular variants observed were not randomly distributed across farms. This finding indicates independent introductions of different variants of the swine H1N1 virus in the various farms in the study and points to a marked difference between the epidemiology of the human and swine influenza viruses. The observed heterogeneity may make it difficult to control swine influenza by vaccination and indicates that the efficacy of current swine influenza vaccines requires reassessment and that the antigenic reactivity of swine influenza viruses should be monitored periodically. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

455,Evolutionary origin of 2A-like sequences in Totiviridae genomes,"In recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of new species potentially belonging to the Totiviridae family. Most of these new viruses have not yet been covered by the official classification of the Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). In this study, a phylogenetic analysis including new Totiviridae candidate sequences revealed a clade that included Giardiaviruses and a large diversity of new totiviruses, which infect arthropods, protozoa, and molluscs. This expanded Giardiavirus clade comprises two monophyletic groups, one of which includes Giardia lamblia virus (GLV) grouped with viruses that infect arthropods and vertebrates (GLV-like group), and the other includes the previously proposed Artivirus group (GLV-like group). IMNV). A screening of members of the GLV-like group for genomic elements already described in the IMNV-like group revealed the existence of sites with a high propensity to convert to 2A-like oligopeptides, mainly in a specific subgroup of arthropod viruses, suggesting that these viruses retained ancestral characteristics. The existence of these ""pseudo 2 A-sites"" associated with the phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that these sequences appear at a decisive stage for viral evolution. If they are changed to functional 2A-like sequences, an irreversible pathway to increase genome complexity will be initiated.",,"de Lima, J. G. S.;Teixeira, D. G.;Freitas, T. T.;Lima, J. P. M.

456,"Akabane, Aino and Schmallenberg viruses: where are we and what do we know about the role of domestic ruminant hosts and Culicoides vectors in virus transmission and hibernation?","Akabane, Aino, and Schmallenberg viruses belong to the Simbu serogroup of Orthobunyaviruses and depend on Culicoides vectors to spread among ruminant hosts. Adult infections are mostly asymptomatic or associated with only mild symptoms, whereas transplacental crossover of these viruses to the developing fetus can have significant teratogenic effects. Research focused primarily on congenital malformations has established a correlation between the stage of development at which a fetus becomes infected and the outcome of an Akabane virus infection. Available data suggest that a similar correlation also applies to Schmallenberg virus infections, but is not yet entirely conclusive. Furthermore, experimental and field data suggest that Akabane virus is more effective in inducing congenital malformations than Aino and Schmallenberg viruses, especially in cattle. The mechanism by which these Simbu viruses undergo annual periods of very low vector abundance in temperate climates remains undefined. Annual wind-borne reintroductions of infected mosquitoes from tropical endemic regions with year-round vector activity have been proposed, as has hibernation in long-lived adult mosquitoes. However, experimental and field data indicate that a role for vertical transmission of the virus in the ruminant host as a mechanism of hibernation cannot currently be excluded. Further studies on the biology of Culicoides and specific groups of transplacentally infected newborn ruminants without severe malformations are needed to shed light on this matter.",,"De Regge, N.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.coviro.2017.10.004,0

458,Bovine papular stomatitis affecting dairy and milking cows in midwestern Brazil,"Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) is a parapoxvirus associated with papular and erosive lesions on the snout, lips, and oral mucosa of cattle. Occasionally the teats of dairy cows are affected and the infection is frequently transmitted to humans. This report describes an outbreak of BPSV infection that affected cows in the midwest of Brazil, with human involvement. The disease was observed in neighboring small hand milking farms and affected 20 dairy cows. Signs included painful reddish papules, ulcers, and proliferative crusted lesions on the nipples, with a clinical course of 7-12 days. The affected cows presented intense local pain, which did not allow milking to be completed. Histologically, acanthosis, spongiosis, and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis with focally adjacent extensive ulcers and multifocal inflammatory infiltrate were observed in the epidermis. Eosinophilic inclusion bodies were observed in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. The milking personnel of the affected cows developed lesions on the hands, painful papules that progressed to ulcerative and crusted lesions in 4-7 days. A polymerase chain reaction using a pan-parapoxvirus primer set for the B2L gene performed on DNA extracted from scabs amplified a 590 bp product, which when sequenced revealed 99%, 85% and 84% similarities with BPSV, Pseudocowpox virus, and Orf virus, respectively. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the B2L sequence, which showed that the virus clustered with BPSV isolates.

459,Laboratory decision making during the 1997-1998 classical swine fever epidemic in the Netherlands,"The National Reference Laboratory for classical swine fever (CSF) virus in the Netherlands examined more than two million samples for CSF virus or serum antibodies during the 1997-1998 CSF epizootic. The immense number of samples and the prevalence of border disease virus (BD) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVD) infections in Dutch pig herds required that laboratory diagnostic efforts be focused in generating CSF-specific test results throughout the eradication campaign. Detection of 82% of the 429 outbreaks was achieved by the combined use of a direct immunofluorescence and peroxidase assay (FAT/IPA) with samples (tonsils) collected from clinically suspect pigs. This suggests that in most of the outbreaks, the pigs had clinical signs that were recognized by the farmer and/or veterinarians, indicating the presence of CSFV in a herd of pigs. The FAT established a positive diagnosis of 74% of all tissue samples (tonsils) collected from infected pig farms. More than 140,000 heparinized blood samples were screened for virus isolation, resulting in the detection of 4.5% of infected herds. CSFV was isolated from approximately 29% of all blood samples collected from pigs on suspected or infected farms. Several serological surveys, each carried out within a different framework, led to the detection of 13.5% of the total number of outbreaks. Detection of antibodies against CSF virus in serum was carried out by semi-automated blocking ELISA. Approximately 28.5% of the ELISA reacting sera were classified as positive for CSF virus neutralizing antibodies and 26.5% as positive for other pestiviruses after virus neutralization test (VNT). We conclude that two of the CSF laboratory diagnostic methods described were decisive in the eradication campaign: first, FAT for screening sick pigs; and second, ELISA and VNT when millions of predominantly healthy pigs needed to be screened for the presence of serum antibodies against CSF. However, decision-making based on the results generated by either method can be seriously hampered when testing samples from herds with a high prevalence of pestiviruses other than CSF.",,"De Smit, A.

Molecular characterization of the virus was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification, cloning, and DNA sequencing of conserved orthopoxvirus genes, such as vaccinia growth factor (VGF), thymidine kinase (TK), and hemagglutinin. We used TK gene and VGF homologue nucleotide sequences to construct a phylogenetic tree for comparison with other poxviruses. The gene sequences showed 99% homology to the vaccinia virus genes and were grouped together with the virus isolate in the phylogenetic tree. Araçatuba virus is very similar to Cantagalo virus, showing the same characteristic deletion in the gene.

Many parvoviral pathogens of medical, veterinary, and ecological importance have been identified. In this study, we use high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to investigate the diversity of parvoviruses that infect wild and domestic animals in Brazil. We identified 21 parvovirus sequences (including twelve near-complete genomes and nine partial genomes) in samples derived from rodents, bats, opossums, birds, and cattle in the states of Pernambuco, São Paulo, Paraná, and Rio Grande do Sul. These sequences were investigated using phylogenetic and distance-based approaches and thus classified into eight parvovirus species (six of which have not been previously described), representing six distinct genera in the subfamily Parvovirinae. Our findings extend the known biogeographic range of previously characterized parvovirus species and the known host range of three parvovirus genera (Dependovirus, Aveparvovirus, and Tetraparvovirus).

463,Clinical neurological signs in cattle with astrovirus-associated encephalitis,"Background: Evidence for neurotropic astroviruses has been established using novel genetic methods in cattle suffering from viral encephalitis of previously unknown origin. Objectives: To describe the clinical signs observed in cattle with astrovirus-associated encephalitis. Animals: Eight bovines (4 cows, 3 heifers and 1 bull of 4 different breeds) admitted to the Ruminant Clinic due to neurological disease and 1 cow investigated in the field. Methods: The cases were selected based on the neuropathological diagnosis of non-suppurative encephalitis, positive result of in situ hybridization for astrovirus and availability of the results of the physical and neurological evaluations. Laboratory results were evaluated if available. Results: The most frequently observed clinical signs were decreased awareness of surroundings (7), cranial nerve dysfunction (5), and decubitus (5). The cow seen in the field was the only animal that had severe behavioral changes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell counts increased in 4 animals and protein concentration increased in 3 of 5 samples. In 1 case, the presence of astrovirus could be identified in a CSF sample by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Other laboratory abnormalities were nonspecific. Conclusions and Clinical Significance: Astrovirus infection may be an important differential diagnosis in cattle with clinical signs of brain disease and should be considered after exclusion of other causes.

Single cycle growth in IBR'S2 cell can be detected at 2h 30min and peaks at 5h. The multiplication takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. By fluorescein immunofluorescence, a specific green fluorescence can be shown in the cytoplasm within four hours after infection. Virions produced by this cell system were concentrated with PEG and analyzed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Thus, two populations of particles have been separated. The first has a sedimentation coefficient of 150S, the other 75S. After isopycnic centrifugation, a density of 1.34 g/cm3 is attributed to the heaviest particles and 1.30 g/cm3 to the lightest. Electron microscopic examination shows that the particles are between 30 and 32 nm in diameter. The particles having a density of 1.30 g/cm3 are all penetrated by the dye and correspond to empty capsids. With these viral antigens, a specific antiserum effective in pigs has been prepared. It can be used for all serological reactions. Therefore, it is used for differential diagnosis by complement fixation tests (classical reaction at 37 °C) using vesicular fluid extracted from diseased pigs. An inactivated oil-adjuvanted vaccine has also been prepared. The protection rate of vaccinated animals is between 75% and 100% with a 95% probability.",,"Delagneau, J.

Data was generated using the Illumina MiSeq 2 × 250 bp and HiSeq 2 × 150 bp sequencing platforms for 16S and WGSM amplicon sequencing, respectively. Each approach revealed a distinct microbial community profile, with Pseudomonas and Psychrobacter as the predominant genus for the WGSM dataset and Clostridium and Methanosaeta for the 16S rRNA gene amplicon dataset. Virome characterization revealed the presence of two viral families with Bacteria and Archaea as hosts, Myoviridae and Siphoviridae. A wide functional diversity was found with a predominance of genes involved in the metabolism of acetone, butanol and ethanol synthesis; and one-carbon metabolism (eg, methanogenesis). Genes related to acetotrophic methanogenesis pathways were more abundant than methylotrophic and hydrogenotrophic, which corroborates the taxonomic results that showed the prevalence of the acetotrophic genus Methanosaeta. Furthermore, the data set indicated a variety of metabolic genes involved in the sulfur, nitrogen, iron and phosphorus cycles, with many genera capable of acting in all cycles. BLAST analysis against the Antibiotic Resistance Gene Database (ARDB) revealed that the microbial community contained 43 different types of antibiotic resistance genes, some of them associated with chicken growth promotion (eg. g., bacitracin, tetracycline, and polymyxin).",,"Delforno, T.

469,Physicochemical characterization of bovine ephemeral fever virus as a member of the Rhabdoviridae family,"This study of the physical-chemical properties of the bovine ephemeral fever virus was initiated to establish whether or not it should be classified as a rhabdovirus. In contrast to the regular bullet-shaped morphology of some rhabdoviruses, virus particles are usually cone-shaped or slightly variant of the bullet-shaped. The virion contains 42S pelleted single-stranded RNA and six proteins with mol. weight of 164, 101, 64, 53, 43 and 29 x 103. The P101 protein is found on the surface of the virus and is glycosylated. It is removed by treating the viral particles with trypsin. The P64 protein, the nucleoprotein, was found to be a phosphoprotein, like the N protein of rabies virus, whereas in vesicular stomatitis virus, the NS is the phosphorylated protein. Virus harvests contain defective particles that interfere. The particles are short conical shapes approximately one-third the length of the infectious virion and similar in morphology to the defective interfering particles of vesicular stomatitis virus. These particles interfere with the replication of bovine ephemeral fever virus but not with the Indiana serotype of vesicular stomatitis virus. They contain single-stranded RNA that settles between 18 and 20S. The particles appear to have a protein composition identical to that found in the virus particle. The physicochemical properties of bovine ephemeral fever virus justify its inclusion in the Rhabdoviridae family. The protein composition differs in detail from that found for vesicular stomatitis and rabies viruses, but is similar to that found for Obodhiang and kotonkan, two viruses of the rabies serogroup isolated from insects in Africa.",,"Della-Porta, A.

Animal sample sources and molecular methods for identification of new viral pathogens and steps to determine their pathogenicity are listed. The difficulties in predicting future interspecies transmissions are highlighted by the wide diversity of known viral zoonoses. Recent surveys of viruses in wild and domestic animals have characterized numerous viruses, including some closely related to those that infect humans. The detection of multiple genetic lineages within viral families infecting a single host species, interspersed phylogenetically with viruses found in other host species, reflects past transmissions between species.

472,Monitoring of the immune response to vaccination with an inactivated vaccine associated with bovine neonatal pancytopenia by deep sequencing transcriptomic analysis in cattle,"Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP) is a new fatal alloimmune/antibody-mediated disease of newborn calves induced by ingestion of colostrum from cows that had been vaccinated with a specific bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) vaccine. . Pathogenic MHC class I molecules had been hypothesized in the vaccine, but no formal proof of specific causal alleles of MHC class I has yet been provided. However, the unique characteristics of the vaccine obviously result in titers. of extremely high specific antibodies in the vaccinated animals, but apparently also in other molecules that induce BNP. Therefore, a complete picture of the immune response to the vaccine is essential. By applying the novel next-generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq) approach, our study provides a new holistic and comprehensive analysis of blood transcriptome regulation after vaccination with the specific BVDV vaccine. Our RNAseq approach identified a new cytokine-like gene in the bovine genome that is highly regulated after vaccination. This gene has never been described before in any other species and could be specific to the immune response of ruminants. Furthermore, our data revealed a highly coordinated immune response to double-stranded (ds) RNA or a dsRNA analogue after vaccination with inactivated single-stranded (ss) RNA vaccine. This would suggest substantial contamination of the vaccine with dsRNA from host cells after culture of the virus or a dsRNA analog applied to the vaccine. The first option would highlight the potential risks associated with growing viruses in homologous cells during vaccine production; the latter option would emphasize the potential risks associated with immunostimulatory adjuvants used in vaccine production.",,"Demasius, W.;Weikard, R.;Hadlich, F.;Muller, K.

To determine the chicken skin virome compared to the human skin virome, a chicken swab sample from fifteen healthy indoor chickens of five genetic origins was screened for the presence of DNA viruses by high-throughput sequencing (HTS). ). The results indicate a predominance of herpesviruses of the Mardivirus genus, either of vaccine origin or of presumably asymptomatic infection. Despite the high sensitivity of the HTS method used here to detect small circular DNA viruses, we did not detect any papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, or circoviruses, indicating that these viruses may not reside in chicken skin. The results suggest that turkey herpesvirus resides on the skin of vaccinated chickens. This study indicates important differences between chicken and human skin viromes. The origin of this difference in relation to skin physiology, environment, or virus population dynamics remains to be studied further.",,"Denesvre, C.;Dumarest, M.;RÃ©my, S.;Gourichon, D.;Eloit, M.",2015.0,,10.1007/s11262-015-1231-8,1

477,Transmission of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 viruses in Australian pigs,"Background Pigs have receptors for human and avian influenza viruses and are a natural host for influenza A viruses. The 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (H1N1pdm) that was derived from avian influenza viruses , human and swine has infected pigs in several countries. Objectives To investigate the relationship between H1N1pdm viruses isolated from pig outbreaks in Australia and human samples associated with one of the outbreaks by phylogenetic analysis, and to determine if there were any reassortment events during human-pig interspecies transmission. Methods Real-time RT-PCR and whole genome sequencing were performed on RNA isolated from nasal swabs and/or virus cultures. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Geneious package. Results Outbreaks of H1N1pdm influenza were detected in three pig farms located in three different states of Australia. Further analysis of the Queensland outbreak led to the identification of two different virus strains in pigs. Two staff members who worked in the same pigsty were also infected with the same two strains found in the pigs. Full genome sequence analysis of the viruses isolated from pigs and humans did not identify any reassortment of these H1N1pdm viruses with seasonal or avian influenza A viruses. Conclusions This is the first report of pigs infected with influenza in Australia and marked the end of the influenza-free era for the Australian pig industry. Although no reassortment was detected in these cases, the ability of these viruses to cross between pigs and humans highlights the importance of monitoring pigs for new influenza infections. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Deng, Y.

478,The porcine virome and xenotransplantation,"The composition of the porcine virome includes viruses that infect pig cells, elements derived from ancient viruses, including endogenous retroviruses inserted into pig chromosomes, and bacteriophages that infect a wide range of pig-inhabiting bacteria. Viruses that infect pigs, including viruses that also infect human cells, as well as porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are important when evaluating the safety of viruses in xenotransplantation. Bacteriophages associated with bacteria primarily in the gut are not relevant in this context. Xenotransplantation using pig cells, tissues or organs is being developed to alleviate the shortage of human transplants. Here, for the first time, published data describing viromes in different pigs and their relevance to xenotransplantation virus safety are reviewed. In conclusion, analysis of the porcine virome has resulted in the description of numerous new viruses, although their impact on xenotransplantation is unclear.

479,Identification of the novel human-bovine reassortant rotavirus strain G8P 6 from Ghana by next-generation sequencing,"Group A rotaviruses (RVA) are the most important etiologic agent of acute gastroenteritis in children under 5 years of age worldwide. The monovalent rotavirus vaccine Rotarix was introduced into the National Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in Ghana in May 2012. However, there is a paucity of genetic and phylogenetic data on the complete genomes of circulating human RVAs prior to introduction. of the vaccine. The common bovine rotavirus VP7 genotype G8 has been detected sporadically in Ghanaian children, usually in combination with the VP4 P genotype[6]. To investigate the genomic constellations and phylogeny of circulating RVA strains prior to vaccine introduction, the complete genomes of two unusual G8P[6] strains, GH018-08 and GH019-08, detected during load surveillance of the disease, were characterized by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. . Isolates from Ghana, GH018-08 and GH019-08, exhibited the unusual and previously unreported constellation of genotypes G8-P[6]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H3. Phylogenetic analyzes confirmed that 10 of the 11 genes of GH018-08 and GH019-08 were identical/near identical, with significant variation detected only in their VP1 genes, and clearly established the occurrence of multiple independent interspecies rearrangement and transmission events. between circulating bovine/ovine/caprine corotaviruses and human DS-1-like RVA strains.

480,Circovirus host range information from the genomic fossil record,"wide range of DNA sequences derived from circoviruses (family Circoviridae) have been identified in samples obtained from humans and domestic animals, often in association with pathological conditions. In most cases, however, little is known about the natural biology of the viruses from which these sequences are derived. Endogenous circoviral elements (CVe) are DNA sequences derived from circoviruses that are found in animal genomes and provide a useful source of information on circovirus-host relationships. In this study, we examined genome assemblies from 675 animal species and identified numerous circovirus-related sequences, including the first examples of CVe derived from cycloviruses. We confirmed the presence of these CVe in the germ line of the elongated twig ant (Pseudomyrmex gracilis), thus establishing that cycloviruses infect insects. We examined the evolutionary relationships between CVe and contemporary circoviruses, showing that ant and mite CVe cluster relatively closely to cycloviruses in phylogeny. Furthermore, the relatively random intercalation of CVe from insect genomes with cyclovirus sequences recovered from vertebrate samples suggested that contamination might be an important consideration in studies reporting these viruses. Our study demonstrates how endogenous viral sequences can inform metagenomics-based virus discovery. In addition, it raises questions about the role of cycloviruses as pathogens of humans and other vertebrates.",,"Dennis, T. P. W.;Flynn, P. J.;de Souza, W. M.;Singer, J. B.;Moreau, C. S.;Wilson, S.

481,Deep sequencing of viral genomes provides insights into the evolution and pathogenesis of varicella zoster virus and its vaccine in humans,"Immunization with the vOka vaccine prevents chickenpox in susceptible children and adults. The vOka vaccine strain comprises a mixture of genotypes and, despite attenuation, causes rashes in a small number of recipients. Like the wild-type virus, the vaccine establishes latency in neuronal tissue and can then be reactivated to cause Herpes zoster (shingles). Using hybridization-based methodologies, we have purified and sequenced vOka directly from skin lesions. We show that alleles present in the vaccine can be recovered from lesions and demonstrate the presence of a severe bottleneck between inoculation and lesion formation. The genotypes in any one lesion appear to descend from one to three vaccine genotypes with a low frequency of new mutations. Neither individual vOka haplotypes nor novel mutations are consistently present in flares, indicating that neither new mutations nor recombination with the wild type are critical to the evolution of vOka flares. In contrast, alleles arising from attenuation (ie, not derived from free-living virus) are less frequently present in exanthematous genotypes. We identify 11 loci at which the ancestral allele is selected for in vOka rash formation and show genotypes in rashes that have reactivated from dormancy that are indistinguishable from rashes that occur immediately after inoculation. We conclude that the vOka vaccine, although heterogeneous, has not evolved to form rashes through positive selection in a quasispecies fashion, but rather has selected against alleles that were essentially neutral during vaccine production in human subjects. which allows us to identify key places for the formation of eruptions.",,"Depledge, D.

Deducing the function(s) of VLT and the molecular mechanisms involved should now be considered a priority to improve our understanding of the factors that govern VZV latency and reactivation.

483,Deep sequencing of different live attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine preparations reveals a conserved core of attenuating single nucleotide polymorphisms,"UNLABELED: The continued success of the live attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine in preventing varicella-zoster and shingles is well documented, as are many of the mutations that contribute to attenuation of the vOka virus for replication in the skin. At least three different preparations of vOka are marketed. Here, we show the use of deep sequencing of seven lots of vOka vaccine (including ZostaVax, VariVax, VarilRix, and the working seed Oka/Biken) from three different manufacturers (VariVax, GSK, and Biken) showing 137 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP) mutations are present in all batches of vaccines. This includes six sites where the vaccinia allele is fixed or nearly fixed, which we assume is likely to be important for attenuation. We also show that despite differences in vaccine populations between preparations, batch-to-batch variation is minimal, as is the number and frequency of unique mutations for individual batches. This suggests that the vaccine manufacturing processes are not introducing new mutations and that despite the mix of variants present, live VZV vaccines are extremely stable. SIGNIFICANCE: The continued success of vaccines in preventing chickenpox and shingles, combined with the extremely low incidence of adverse reactions, indicates the quality of these vaccines. The vaccine itself is composed of a heterogeneous population of live attenuated viruses and therefore requires deep sequencing technologies to explore the differences and similarities in virus populations between different vaccine preparations and batches. Our data demonstrate minimal lot-to-lot variation, an important safety feature, and provide new insights into the extent of mutations present in this attenuated virus.",,"Depledge, D.

The BHV1 UL28 ORF, located at positions 53,058 â†' 55,538 of the viral genome, encodes a 3.4 kb viral-specific transcript detected at 6 h postinfection (pi), after which its levels accumulated up to 12 h pi and then remained constant up to 24 h pi.

A BHV1 UL28-specific antiserum, raised against a T7-Tag/UL28 fusion protein expressed in E. coli, reacted specifically with a 100 kDa protein in Western blots of protein cell lysates infected with BHV1. The kinetics of protein expression was delayed by 6 h in relation to that of its transcript, suggesting that the gene is regulated at the translational level. Unlike the UL28 genes of HSV and pseudorabies, which belong to the viral genes of the early (β) class, BHV1 was unambiguously classified as a γ2 gene.

Of specific interest are viral agents associated with RSS which have been difficult to fully characterize to date. Previous research on the etiology of RSS has implicated a wide variety of RNA and DNA viruses; however, to date, no single virus has been identified as the main agent of RSS and current opinion is that it may be caused by a community of viruses. collectively known as the virome.

491,Enrichment of viral nucleic acids by hybrid selection in solution with genus-specific oligonucleotides,"Despite recent advances, our knowledge of rare and potential human pathogens is far from exhaustive. Current molecular diagnostic tools are mainly based on the specific amplification of marker sequences and can miss infections caused by rare and unknown pathogens. The use of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) can solve this problem; but, due to the extremely low fraction of genetic material of the pathogen in clinical samples, its application is only profitable in special and non-routine cases. In this study, we present a method for the semi-specific enrichment of viral conservative sequences in an HTS library by solution hybridization with biotinylated degenerate genus-specific oligonucleotides. The nucleic acids of the test viruses (yellow fever virus and Japanese encephalitis virus) were enriched by hybrid selection in solution using pan-flavivirus oligonucleotides. In addition, enterovirus (family: Picornaviridae, genus: Enterovirus) sequences were successfully enriched using oligonucleotides from foot-and-mouth disease virus (family: Picornaviridae, genus: Aphthovirus). The enrichment factor relative to background nucleic acid was approximately 1,000-fold. Since hybridization has less stringent oligonucleotide matching requirements than PCR, few oligonucleotides are sufficient to cover possible sequence variation across the genus and can even enrich for nucleic acids of viruses from other related genera. Efficient enrichment of viral sequences makes their use in diagnostics cost-effective.",,"Deviatkin, A. A.;Lukashev, A. N.;Markelov, M. M.;Gmyl, L. V.;Shipulin, G. A.",2017.0,2029-08-01 00:00:00,,0
492,Megaphages infect Prevotella and variants are widespread in gut microbiomes,"Bacteriophages (phages) dramatically shape the composition of the microbial community, redistribute nutrients through host lysis, and drive evolution through horizontal gene transfer. Despite their importance, much remains to be learned about phages in the human microbiome. We investigated the gut microbiomes of humans from Bangladesh and Tanzania, two social groups of African baboons, and Danish pigs; many of these microbiomes contain phages belonging to a clade with genomes greater than 540 kilobases in length, the largest yet reported in the human microbiome and close to the maximum size ever reported for phages. We refer to these as Lak phages. The orientation of the CRISPR spacer indicates that Lak phages infect bacteria of the genus Prevotella. We hand-curated to completion 15 distinct Lak phage genomes recovered from metagenomes. The genomes display several interesting features, including the use of an alternative genetic code, large, highly expressed intergenic regions, and up to 35 putative transfer RNAs, some of which contain enigmatic introns. Different individuals have different phage genotypes, and changes in variant frequencies over consecutive sampling days reflect changes in the relative abundance of phage subpopulations. Recent homologous recombination has resulted in extensive genomic pooling of nine populations of baboon Lak phage. We infer that Lak phages are widespread in gut communities containing Prevotella species, and conclude that megaphages, with fascinating and underexplored biology, may be common but largely ignored components of human and animal gut microbiomes.",,"Devoto, A.

Recently, a new PRV (formerly PRV-Om, here called PRV-3) was found in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with HSMI-like disease. PRV is considered an emerging pathogen in farmed salmonids. In this study, the molecular and antigenic characterization of PRV-3 was performed. Erythrocytes are the main target cells for PRV, and blood samples that were collected from experimentally challenged fish were used as the source of virus. Virus particles were purified by gradient ultracentrifugation and the complete PRV-3 coding sequences were obtained by Illumina sequencing. Compared to PRV-1, the nucleotide identity of the coding regions was 80.1%, and the amino acid identities of the predicted PRV-3 proteins ranged from 96.7% (lambda1) to 79.1% ( sigma3). Phylogenetic analysis showed that PRV-3 belongs to a separate group. The sigma3 coding region was sequenced from PRV-3 isolates collected from rainbow trout in Europe. These sequences clustered but were distant from the PRV-3 that was isolated from rainbow trout in Norway. Bioinformatic analyzes of PRV-3 proteins revealed that the predicted secondary structures and functional domains were conserved between PRV-3 and PRV-1. Rabbit antisera raised against purified virus or various recombinant viral proteins of PRV-1 cross-reacted with PRV-3. Our findings indicate that despite the different species preferences of PRV subtypes, several genetic, antigenic, and structural properties are conserved between PRV-1 and PRV-3.",,"Dhamotharan, K.;Vendramin, N.;Markussen, T.;Wessel, O.;Cuenca, A.;Nyman, I.

494,Recent epidemiology of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV),"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an economically important viral disease of goats and sheep first described in West Africa in the 1940s. The virus has been circulating in parts of sub-Saharan Africa for several decades and in the East Middle and South Asia since 1993, although the first description of the virus in India dates from 1987. Studying the genetic relationship between isolates from different geographical origins, a selected region of the fusion protein (F) gene of the viruses was amplified using RT/PCR and the resulting DNA product was sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Viruses from 27 outbreaks in countries in Asia and the Middle East, reported between 1993 and 2000, and two recent outbreaks from the African continent were compared with the prototype African strain. Of the four known PPR virus lineages, lineages 1 and 2 viruses have been found exclusively in West Africa. Virus from an outbreak in Burkina Faso in 1999 fell into lineage group 1. Lineage 3 viruses have been found in East Africa, where an outbreak in Ethiopia in 1996 was of this type, and also in Arabia and the South India. However, there have been no further lineage 3 virus isolates in India since the one reported in 1992 in Tamil Nadu. A virus from this lineage was found circulating in Yemen in 2001. In the past 8 years, virus exclusively from the fourth lineage has spread throughout the Middle East and the Asian subcontinent, reaching as far east as Nepal and Bangladesh. This lineage of the virus was also reported in Kuwait in 1999. The geographic source of the new lineage 4 virus is unknown, although it is more closely related to the African lineage 1. The possibility that its earlier presence in northern India was masked from circulation of rinderpest virus, a related virus of cattle, is considered unlikely. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",,"Dhar, P.;Sreenivasa, B.

496,Temperate coliphages: classification and correlation with habitats,"Temperate coliphages were recovered from sewage, mammalian feces, and lysogenic strains of Escherichia coli. A total of 32 phages of independent origin were divided into six groups using the criteria of host range, antigenic homology, and ultraviolet inducibility of the prophage. The demonstration of genetic interactions in some cases has confirmed the classification scheme. Nine phages were assigned to the P2 family and 19 to the lambda family. The remaining four isolates may represent some novel phylogenetic types. Phage recovered from lysogenic strains of E. coli were all found to be P2-related, whereas most phage recovered as cell-free plaque-forming units were assignable to the lambda family. It is proposed that the biological attributes of the phages belonging to the two main families are reflected in the observed distribution patterns. Virions of phage HK256 show multiple tail fibers and thus may represent a 'new' virion form among temperate coliphages.",,"Dhillon, E. K. S.;Dhillon, T. S.;Lam, Y. Y.;Tsang, A. H. C.",1980.0,,,0

498,Plasticity of the triple reassortment influenza A H1N1 virus genome during infection of vaccinated pigs.,"To obtain information on the evolution of influenza A viruses (IAVs) during infection of vaccinated pigs, we experimentally infected a 3-week-old naïve pig with a triple reassortment H1N1 IAV and placed the seeding pig in direct contact with a group of age-matched vaccinated pigs (n510), we indexed the genetic diversity and evolution of the virus at the intrahost level by deep whole-genome sequencing directly from nasal swabs collected in two separate samplings during infection, we obtained 13 metagenomes IAV from 13 samples, which included the virus inoculum and two samples from each of the six pigs that tested positive for IAV during the study. Infection produced a population of heterogeneous alleles (sequence variants) that was dynamic over time. Overall, 794 polymorphisms were identified across all samples, producing 327 alleles, 214 of which were unique sequences, a total of 43 distinct hemagglutinin proteins were translated, two of which were observed in multiple pigs, w while neuraminidase (NA) was conserved and only one dominant NA was found throughout the study, the genetic diversity of IAVs changed dynamically within and between pigs, however, most of the observed substitutions in internal gene segments were synonymous. Our results demonstrated remarkable diversity of IAVs and the complex, rapid and dynamic evolution of IAVs during infection of vaccinated pigs that can only be appreciated with repeated sampling of individual animals and deep sequence analyses.",,"Diaz, A.;Enomoto, S.;Romagosa, A.;Sreevatsan, S.;Nelson, M.;Culhane, M.;Torremorell, M.",2015.0,,10.1099/jgv.0.000258,0
499,Molecular characteristics of Nipah virus glycoproteins,"Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus that emerged in 1998 from fruit bats in Malaysia and caused an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in pigs and fatal encephalitis in humans with high mortality rates. Unlike most paramyxoviruses, NiV can infect a wide variety of mammalian species. Due to this wide host range, its zoonotic potential, its high pathogenicity for humans, and the lack of effective vaccines or therapies, NiV was classified as a biosafety level 4 pathogen. This article provides an overview of the molecular characteristics of NiV by focusing on the structure, functions, and unique biological properties of the two surface glycoproteins of NiV, receptor-binding protein G and fusion protein F. Since Viral glycoproteins are important determinants for cell tropism and virus propagation, a detailed understanding of these proteins can help understand the molecular basis of viral pathogenicity. © 2007 New York Academy of Sciences.",,"Diederich, S.;Maisner, A.",2007.0,,10.1196/annals.1408.003,0
500,Genetic analysis of avian paramyxovirus-1 (Newcastle disease virus) isolates from pig populations in China related to commonly used commercial vaccine strains,"Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is thought to only infect avian species. However, at least eight NDV strains were isolated from pig populations in China during 1999-2006, four of which were genetically and phylogenetically characterized. Genetic analysis revealed that JL106 and SP13 had a 112G-RQGR-L117 motif at the F protein cleavage site, while JL01 and MP01 had a 112G-KQGR-L117 motif, indicating that they were all typical of viruses. of low virulence. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete sequences of the F gene showed that JL106 and SP13 belonged to genotype II, similar to the commercial La Sota vaccine strain commonly used in China. While JL01 and MP01 were grouped within genotype I, genetically identical to the V4 vaccine strain. Animal tests showed that JL106 can effectively infect chickens. The present results indicated that the use of live vaccines La Sota and V4 and close contact between birds and pigs can result in an infection between species, therefore, it is necessary to carry out a greater epidemiological surveillance of swine VEN. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Ding, Z.;Cong, Y.

501,MicroRNA modulation in two genetically disparate chicken lines showing different susceptibility to necrotic enteritis disease,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in post-transcriptional regulation by influencing the 3'-UTR of target genes. Using two inbred White Leghorn chicken lines, line 6.3 and line 7.2 that display resistant and susceptible phenotypes to Marek's disease, respectively, we used small RNA high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to investigate whether miRNAs are expressed in a nonspecific manner. different in these two chicken lines after inducing necrotic enteritis (NE). The 12 miRNAs, selected from the most down- or up-regulated miRNAs after NE induction, were confirmed by their expressions in real-time PCR. Among these miRNAs, miR-215, miR-217, miR-194, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-216a, miR-216b, and miR-429 were highly expressed in line 7.2-derived gut, while that miR-1782 and miR-499 were downregulated. In the spleen, miR-34b and miR-1684 were the most highly regulated miRNAs in line 6.3. Notably, five of the six target genes, CXCR5, BCL2, GJA1, TCF12, and TAB3, were differentially expressed between line 6.3 and line 7.2, and were suppressed in the MD-susceptible chicken line. Their expression levels were inversely correlated with those of miRNA obtained from both HTS and quantitative real-time PCR. These results suggest that some miRNAs are differentially altered in response to NE and modulate the expression of their target genes in the two inbred lines. Taken together, HTS analysis of intestinal miRNAs from ND-affected inbred chickens displaying different disease phenotypes led to the identification of miRNA-regulated host immunity genes. Future studies of the function of these miRNAs and their target genes in the host will lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control host-pathogen interaction in NE. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,"Dinh, H.;Hong, Y.

504,Metagenomic analysis of RNA viruses in a freshwater lake,"Freshwater lakes and ponds present an ecological interface between humans and a variety of host organisms. They are a habitat for the larval stage of many insects and can serve as a medium for intraspecies and interspecies transmission of viruses such as avian influenza A virus. In addition, freshwater bodies are already known reservoirs of disease-causing viruses, such as Norwalk virus, Coxsackievirus, Echovirus and Adenovirus. While RNA virus populations have been studied in marine environments, there has been very limited analysis of the viral community in freshwater to date. Here we present a survey of RNA viruses in Lake Needwood, a freshwater lake in Maryland, USA. Our results indicate that, as in studies of other aquatic environments, most of the recovered nucleic acid sequences they did not show any significant similarity to known sequences. The remaining sequences are primarily from viral types with significant similarity to approximately 30 viral families. We speculate that these new viruses can infect a variety of hosts, including plants, insects, fish, domestic animals, and humans. Among these viruses, we have discovered a previously unknown dsRNA virus closely related to Banna virus, which is responsible for a febrile illness and is endemic to Southeast Asia. In addition, we found multiple viral sequences distantly related to Israeli acute paralysis virus that has been implicated in bee colony collapse disorder. Our data suggest that, due to their direct contact with humans, domestic and wild animals, freshwater ecosystems could serve as reservoirs for a wide range of viruses (both pathogenic and non-pathogenic) and possibly be involved in the spread of emerging diseases. and pandemics. © 2009 Djikeng et al.",,"Djikeng, A.;Kuzmickas, R.;Anderson, N.

Most studies of their genetic diversity focus on the VP7 and VP4 genes, but the complete genomes of 18 human RVCs have been described in independent studies. The genetic background of RVCs from Far East Asia is different from other human RVCs found in India and Bangladesh. Recently, an RVC detected in 2010 in South Korea had a similar genetic background to RVCs from India and Bangladesh. This study was carried out to determine the complete genome of eight Japanese RVCs detected between 2005 and 2012, and compare them with other global human and animal RVCs to better understand the genetic background of contemporary Far East Asian RVCs. By phylogenetic analysis, human RVCs appeared to be distinct from animal RVCs. Among human RVCs, three lineage constellations had prolonged circulation. The genetic background of RVC from Far East Asia was distinguished from RVC from India and Bangladesh, as previously reported. However, we found one Japanese RVC in 2012 that had an Indian-Bangladeshi RVC genetic background, while the remaining seven Japanese RVCs had the typical Far East Asian RVC genetic background. This is the first RVC report from India and Bangladesh in Japan. With that observation and the human RVC redistribution event in Hungary, our study indicates that RVCs are spreading from one region to another.",,"Doan, Y.

The genome was found to contain a large open reading frame encoding a leader protein before the capsid protein region. This showed no sequence identity with other picornavirus leader regions and sequence data suggested that it does not possess proteolytic activity. Protease 2A was small and showed considerable sequence identity to aphthoviruses and equine rhinovirus serotype 2. The 2A/2B junction possessed the typical cleavage site (NPG/P) exhibited by these viruses. The other proteins shared less than 40% sequence identity with equivalent proteins from other picornavirus genera. Phylogenetic analyzes of the P1 and 3D sequences indicated that this virus forms a distinct branch of the family Picornaviridae.

508,Functional characterization of a monoclonal antibody epitope using a lambda phage display deep sequencing platform,"Recently, we have described a method, called PROFILER, for the identification of antigenic regions preferentially targeted by polyclonal antibody responses after vaccination. To test the ability of the technique to provide insight into the functional properties of monoclonal antibody (mAb) epitopes, we here used a well-characterized epitope of meningococcal factor H-binding protein (fHbp), which is recognized by mAb 12C1. An fHbp library, engineered into a lambda phage vector that allows surface expression of polypeptides of widely different lengths, was subjected to massive parallel sequencing of phage inserts after affinity selection with mAb 12C1. We detected dozens of unique antibody-selected sequences, the most enriched of which (designated FrC) could largely recapitulate the ability of fHbp to bind mAb 12C1. Computational analysis of the cumulative enrichment of individual amino acids in the antibody-selected fragments identified two stretches of overrepresented residues (H248-K254 and S140-G154), the presence of which was subsequently found to be required for FrC binding to mAb 12C1.

512,Phylogenetic Diversity and Genotypic Complexity of Influenza A H9N2 Viruses Revealed by Genomic Sequence Analysis,"Influenza A H9N2 viruses have become established worldwide in terrestrial and wild birds, and are occasionally transmitted to mammals, including humans and pigs. To comprehensively elucidate the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of H9N2 influenza viruses, we performed a large-scale sequence analysis of 571 viral genomes from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource Database, representing the spectrum of influenza viruses. influenza H9N2 isolates from 1966 to 2009. Our study provides a panoramic framework to better understand the genesis and evolution of H9N2 influenza viruses, and to describe the history of H9N2 viruses circulating in various hosts. Panorama's phylogenetic analysis of the eight viral gene segments revealed the complexity and diversity of H9N2 influenza viruses. The 571 H9N2 viral genomes were classified into 74 separate lineages, which had marked host and geographic differences in phylogeny. Panorama's genotypic analysis also revealed that H9N2 viruses include at least 98 genotypes, which were divided according to their HA lineages into seven series (AG). Phylogenetic analysis of internal genes showed that H9N2 viruses are closely related to influenza virus subtypes H3, H4, H5, H7, H10, and H14. Our results indicate that H9N2 viruses have undergone extensive reassortments to generate multiple reassortments and genotypes, suggesting that continued circulation of multiple genotypic H9N2 viruses worldwide in diverse hosts has the potential to cause future influenza outbreaks in poultry. and epidemics in humans.

To assess the role of black-billed magpies (Pica pica) in influenza A virus evolution, we conducted two epidemic surveys of avian influenza viruses in wild black-billed magpies in Guangxi, China in 2005 and we characterized three isolated black-billed magpies. H9N2 virus (BbM virus). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that three BbM viruses were nearly identical, with 99.7 to 100% nucleotide homology in their entire genomes, and were reassignments containing BJ94-like HA, NA, M, and NS genes (Ck/BJ/ 1/94), SH/F/98-like PB2, PA, and NP genes (Ck/SH/F/98), and H5N1-like PB1 genes (Ck/YN/1252/03, clade 1). Genetic analysis showed that BbM viruses were likely the result of multiple reassortments between co-circulating H9N2-like and H5N1-like viruses, and were genetically different from other H9N2 viruses due to the existence of H5N1-like PB1 genes. Genotypic analysis revealed that BbM viruses evolved from various sources and belonged to a new genotype (B46) discovered in our recent study. Molecular analysis suggested that the BbM viruses were probably low pathogenic rearrangements. However, the results of our pathogenicity study demonstrated that BbM viruses replicated efficiently in chickens and a mammalian mouse model, but were not lethal to infected chickens and mice. Antigenic analysis showed that the BbM viruses were antigenic heterologous to the H9N2 vaccine strain. Our study is probably the first report documenting and characterizing H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from black-billed magpies in southern China.

However, the ecology and evolution of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses in this region are limited. This project-based avian influenza surveillance in the Qinghai Lake region began in 2012. Method: Wild bird feces and lake surface water samples were collected in Qinghai Lake in 2012. Virus isolation was performed on embryonated chicken eggs. Influenza A virus was determined by rRT-PCR. Virus sequences were acquired by deep sequencing. Phylogenetic correlation and molecular characteristics of the viruses were analyzed. Virus growth and infection characteristics, receptor binding preference, and in vitro pathogenicity were studied. Results: Two influenza viruses subtype H13N8 were isolated. Viruses belong phylogenetically to the Eurasian lineage. Most of the genes are associated with the gull-derived influenza virus, except for the PB1 gene, which is most likely derived from the Anseriformes virus. Evidence of rearrangement between species was presented. Both viruses have limited growth capacity in MDCK and A549 cells, while they grow well in embryonated eggs. The double receptor binding characteristics of the two viruses were shown. Characteristics of low pathogenicity were determined by the trypsin-dependent plaque formation assay. Conclusions: The two influenza viruses subtype H13N8 are highly associated with the origin of seagulls. The interspecies reassortment of the H13 subtype virus among Anseriformes and Charadriiformes wild birds emphasizes the importance of strengthening avian influenza surveillance in this region.

In this study, ZJ01 caused fatal illness, while the prototypic Chinese PRV LA strain caused mild respiratory disorders. Whole genome sequencing results indicate that the two viruses can be classified into two subgroups that differ from traditional European and American strains. To examine the potential role of gE and gI proteins in ZJ01 virulence, we generated several recombinant viruses. In two chimeric viruses (rZJ01-LA/gEI and rLA-ZJ01/gEI), the gE and gI genes were swapped using the corresponding genes from ZJ01 and LA. rZJ01-LA/gEI and the parent virus rZJ01 maintained high virulence in piglets, although the survival time for piglets infected with rZJ01-LA/gEI was obviously prolonged. In contrast, rLA-ZJ01/gEI exhibited greater virulence than its parent virus rLA.

517,Dynamic coevolution and interaction of avian leukosis virus genetic variants and host immune responses,"Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J), a typical retrovirus, is characterized by the existence of a cloud of diverse variants and considerable genetic diversity. Previous studies describing the evolutionary dynamics of ALV-J genetic variants focused mainly on the early infection period or on a few randomly selected clones. Here, we inoculated 30 specific pathogen free chickens with the same ALV-J founder stock of known genetic background. Six chickens (three antibody positive and three antibody negative) were selected from 15 viraemic chickens. Viruses were serially isolated at 36 weeks and then sequenced using the MiSeq high-throughput sequencing platform. This produced the largest ALV-J dataset to date, made up of more than three million clean reads. Our results showed that host humoral immunity could greatly enhance the genetic diversity of ALV-J genetic variants. In particular, selection pressures promoted dynamic proportional changes in the frequency of ALV-J genetic variants. The cross-neutralization experiment showed that, along with the change of the dominant variant, the specific antibody titers of the infectious clones corresponding to the most dominant variants at weeks 12 and 28 also changed significantly in sera collected at weeks 16 and 28. 32. In contrast, no change of dominant variant was observed in antibody-negative chickens. Furthermore, we identified a new hypervariable region in the gp85 gene.

519,Phylogenetic analysis of rotavirus A NSP2 gene sequences and evidence of intragenic recombination,"The rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP2 is one of the most abundant and earliest viral proteins produced during infection. This protein has multiple essential functions in the replication cycle involving RNA binding, viroplasm formation, helicase, and can hydrolyze RNA γ-phosphate and NTPs that act as RTPase and NTPase. Studying sequences of rotavirus strains isolated in Australia between 1984 and 2009, the NSP2 gene was found to be highly conserved and clustered with NSP2 genotypes N1 and N2 defined by the genome-wide rotavirus classification system. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that NSP2 gene sequences isolated from Australian rotavirus strains formed four distinct lineages. Temporal variation was observed in several groups over the 26-year period, with lineage D identified throughout the study period and lineage A only detected since 1999. Phylogenetic analysis and dendrograms identified NSP2 genes that exhibited rearrangement between different genotypes of VP7 virus, as well as a sequence from a human strain that clustered closely with the NSP2 genes of bovine rotavirus strains. This study also identified a sequence that was across lineages and exhibited evidence of recombination, the first time that intergenic recombination has been detected in an NSP2 gene sequence. This study increases the understanding of the mechanisms of NSP2 evolution in view of improved vaccine design. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",,"Donker, N. C.;Boniface, K.;Kirkwood, C.

520,Fungal identification in shotgun metagenomics datasets,"Metagenomics uses nucleic acid sequencing to characterize the diversity of species in different niches, such as environmental biomes or the human microbiome. Most studies have used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to identify bacteria. However, the declining cost of sequencing has resulted in a gradual shift away from amplicon analyzes towards shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Shotgun metagenomic data can be used to identify a wide range of species, but has rarely been applied to fungal identification. Here, we develop a sequence classification pipeline, FindFungi, and use it to identify fungal sequences in public metagenome datasets. We focus primarily on animal metagenomes, especially the microbiomes of pigs and mice. We identified fungi in 39 of 70 datasets comprising 71 fungal species. At least 11 pathogenic species with zoonotic potential were identified, including Candida tropicalis. We identified Pseudogymnoascus species from 13 Antarctic soil samples initially analyzed for the presence of bacteria capable of degrading diesel fuel. We also show that Candida tropicalis and Candida loboi are probably the same species. Furthermore, we identified several examples where contaminating DNA was mistakenly included in fungal genome assemblies.",,"Donovan, P. D.;Gonzalez, G.;Higgins, D. G.;Butler, G.;Ito, K.",2018.0,,,0

522,Assessing the diversity of rodent-borne viruses: exploring high-throughput sequencing and classical amplification/sequencing approaches,"Rodents are distributed throughout the world and interact with humans in many ways. They provide vital ecosystem services, some species are useful models in biomedical research, and some are kept as companion animals. However, many rodent species can have adverse effects, such as damage to crops and stored products, and are of health concern due to transmission of pathogens to humans and livestock. The first rodent viruses were discovered using isolation approaches and resulted in revolutionary knowledge in immunology, molecular and cell biology, and cancer research. In addition to rodent-specific viruses, rodent-borne viruses are causing a large number of zoonotic diseases. The most prominent examples are the re-emerging outbreaks of human hemorrhagic fever cases caused by sand and hantaviruses. In addition, rodents are reservoirs for vector-borne pathogens, such as tick-borne encephalitis virus and Borrelia spp., and may carry human pathogens but are not likely to be involved in their transmission to humans. Today, next-generation sequencing or high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is revolutionizing the speed of discovery of new viruses, but other molecular approaches, such as RT-PCR/generic PCR and rolling circle amplification, contribute significantly to the rapidly advancing process. However, current knowledge still represents only the tip of the iceberg, when known human viruses are compared with those known for rodents, the mammalian taxon with the largest number of species. The diagnostic potential of HTS-based metagenomic approaches is illustrated by their use in the discovery and genome-wide determination of novel borna and adenoviruses as disease-causing agents in squirrels. In conclusion, HTS, in combination with conventional RT-PCR/PCR-based approaches, resulted in a much better understanding of the diversity of rodent viruses. Future enhancements to the workflows used, including bioinformatic analysis, will further improve our knowledge and preparedness should new viruses emerge. Additional classical and molecular virological approaches are needed for genome annotation and functional characterization of new viruses, discovered by these technologies, and evaluation of their zoonotic potential.",,"Drewes, S.;StrakovÃ¡, P.;Drexler, J.

Here we identify approximately 66 new paramyxoviruses in a worldwide sample of 119 bat and rodent species (9278 individuals). Major discoveries include evidence for the origin of Hendra and Nipah viruses in Africa, the identification of a bat virus conspecific to the human mumps virus, the detection of close relatives of respiratory syncytial virus, mouse pneumonia, and distemper virus. canine in bats, as well as direct evidence of Sendai virus in rodents. Phylogenetic reconstruction of host associations suggests a predominance of host shifts from bats to other mammals and birds. Hypothesis tests in a maximum likelihood framework allow for the phylogenetic placement of bats as tentative hosts at the ancestral nodes of the two main subfamilies of Paramyxoviridae (Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae).

524,Bats around the world carry viruses related to hepatitis E virus that form a putative novel genus within the family Hepeviridae.,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the most common causes of acute hepatitis in tropical and temperate climates. Tropical genotypes 1 and 2 are associated with foodborne and waterborne transmission. Zoonotic reservoirs (mainly pigs, wild boars and deer) are considered for genotypes 3 and 4, which exist in temperate climates. In view of the association of several zoonotic viruses with bats, we screened 3,869 bat specimens from 85 different species and from five continents for hepevirus RNA. HEVs were detected in African, Central American, and European bats, forming a new phylogenetic clade in the family Hepeviridae. Bat hepeviruses were highly diversified and comparable to human HEV in sequence variation. No evidence of transmission of bat hepeviruses to humans was found in more than 90,000 donations of human blood and sera from individual patients. Analysis of the complete genome of a representative virus confirmed the formal classification within the family Hepeviridae. Taxonomic evaluations based on sequences and distances suggested that bat hepeviruses constitute a distinct genus within the family Hepeviridae and that at least three other genera can be designated comprising human, rodent and avian hepeviruses. This may imply that hepeviruses invaded mammalian hosts not recently and underwent speciation according to their host constraints.

525,Next-generation sequencing shows diversification of West Nile virus quasispecies after a single passage in an in vivo infection model of a carrion crow (Corvus corone),"West Nile virus (WNV) occurs as a population of genetic variants (quasispecies) that infect a single animal. Previous low-resolution estimates of viral genetic diversity in sampled wild birds and mosquitoes, and in multi-passage adaptation studies in vivo or in cell culture, suggest that WNV genetic diversification is primarily limited to the mosquito vector. This study investigated the genetic diversification of WNV in avian hosts during a single passage using next-generation sequencing. Wild-caught carrion crows were infected subcutaneously using a clonal WNV from the Middle East. Blood samples were collected 2 and 4 days after infection. A reverse transcription (RT)-PCR approach was used to amplify the WNV genome directly from serum samples prior to next-generation sequencing, resulting in an average depth of at least 700x in each sample. Appropriate controls were sequenced to discriminate biologically relevant low frequency variants from experimentally introduced errors. WNV populations in wild crows showed significant diversification away from the quasispecies structure of the seed virus. In contrast, WNV populations in intracerebrally infected day-old chicks did not diversify from those in the inoculum. Where previous studies concluded that WNV genetic diversification is only experimentally demonstrated in its permissive insect vector species, we have experimentally demonstrated significant WNV population diversification in a wild bird reservoir species.",,"Dridi, M.;Rosseel, T.;Orton, R.;Johnson, P.;Lecollinet, S.;Muylkens, B.;Lambrecht, B.;Van Borm, S.",2015.0,Oct,,0
526,Complete nucleotide sequence of a Chinese vaccine strain of serotype Asia1 of foot-and-mouth disease virus,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the Chinese vaccine strain Asia1/YNBS/58 of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was determined. The results showed that the entire genome of YNBS/58 is 8164 nucleotides (nt) in length, including a 1061 nt 5-inch untranslated region (UTR), a 6990 nt open reading frame (ORF), and a 5-in. 3-inch 113 nt untranslated. €²UTR. The genome sequences of Asia1/YNBS/58 and other known strains of FMD virus were compared. Homology analysis indicated that nonstructural proteins are more conserved than structural proteins in FMDV and that the 5'UTR is more conserved than the 3'UTR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Asia1/YNBS/58 is clustered in the serotype Asia1 and is linked to three other isolates, Asia1/IND/63/72, Asia1/3kimron/63, and Asia1/2ISRL/63, suggesting that they have a close relationship. genetic relationship. Phylogenetic trees based on VP1, VP2, and VP3 were divided into distinct groups according to different serotypes, while other gene-based phylogenetic trees exhibited some degree of interbreeding between serotypes. Based on the nucleotide similarities between Asia1/YNBS/58 and two recent Chinese isolates from Asia1, Asia1/HKN/05 and Asia1/JS/05, each forms a distinct genotype.

527,MicroRNA expression profile of sheep primary testicular cells in response to bluetongue virus infection,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a member of the Orbivirus genus within the Reoviridae family and causes a non-contagious insect-borne disease in domestic and wild ruminants, primarily sheep and occasionally in cattle and some species of deer. Virus infection can trigger changes in the expression profile of cellular microRNAs (miRNAs), which play important post-transcriptional regulatory roles in gene expression and can greatly influence viral replication and pathogenesis. Here, we employed deep sequencing technology to determine which cellular miRNAs were differentially expressed in testicular (ST) cells from BTV-infected primary sheep. A total of 25 known miRNAs and 240 novel miRNA candidates that were differentially expressed in BTV-infected and uninfected ST cells were identified, and 251 and 8428 predicted target genes were annotated, respectively. Nine differentially expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets were validated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Target prediction and functional analysis of these regulated miRNAs revealed significant enrichment for several signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K-Akt, endocytosis, Hippo, NF-kB, viral carcinogenesis, FoxO, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways.

We collected 574 pharyngeal and anal swab samples from 287 rodents of 10 different species from eight representative regions of China from October 2013 to July 2015. Seven identified representative sequences from six rodent species were amplified as complete genomes and classified into four lineages. .

It has a wide distribution throughout the world and has also been reported to infect humans. Although many strains have been isolated from different parts of mainland China, rarely have any strain been reported from the southern provinces of China. We studied a case of orf virus infection that occurred in Qingyuan city, Guangdong province in southern China. An orf virus strain, GDQY, was successfully isolated and identified by cell culture techniques and transmission electron microscopy. The complete genes of ORFV011, ORFV059, ORFV106 and ORFV107 were amplified for sequence analysis based on their nucleotide or amino acid level. To discuss genetic variation, precise sequences were used to compare with other reference strains isolated from different districts or countries. Phylogenetic trees based on these strains were constructed and evolutionary distances were calculated based on the alignment of their complete sequences. The typical orf virus structure was observed in cell culture suspensions inoculated with GDQY, and the full length of four genes was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that GDQY is homologous to FJ-DS and CQ/WZ at nucleotides ORFV011. ORFV059 may be more variable than ORFV011 based on comparison between GDQY and other isolates.

The virus was highly virulent for chickens and killed them within two days of experimental inoculation. with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 2.88. For genetic and phylogenetic analyses, whole genome sequencing of 4 viral isolates was performed. The isolates revealed multiple basic amino acids in their hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site, similar to other ""Qinghai-like"" H5N1 isolates. The receptor binding site of the HA molecule contained avian-type amino acids (222Q and 224G). The isolates also contained the K amino acid residue at position 627 of the PB2 protein and other markers on the NS 1 and PB1 proteins, highlighting the risk to mammals. However, the isolates were sensitive to currently available anti-influenza drugs. Sequence analysis indicated that the Bhutanese viruses shared 99.1-100% nucleotide homology in all eight genes between them and the 2010 chicken isolate from Bangladesh (A/chicken/Bangladesh/1151-11/2010), indicating a common parent virus. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Bhutanese isolates belonged to subclade 2.2.3 (EMA 3) and shared a common parent virus with the 2010 Bangladesh virus.

Phylogenetic analysis of the complete spike 1 (S1) gene sequences revealed a new IBV genotype that we refer to as 'IBADAN'. The minimum genetic distance to the closest 'non-IBADAN' strains (UK/7/93 at the nucleotide level; H120 and M41 at the amino acid level) reached 24 and 32% at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively. The complete genome of the IBADAN reference strain (NGA/A116E7/2006) had a genetic distance of 9.7-16.4% at the nucleotide level with all fully sequenced strains available. Since IBV S1 plays an important role in antigenicity, the antigenic relationship of NGA/A116E7/2006 was compared with strains of other serotypes. NGA/A116E7/2006 did not cross-react with antisera against strains IT02, M41, D274, Connecticut, or 793/B in virus neutralization assays. NGA/A116E7/2006 cross-reacted with the QX-like strain ITA/90254/2005 but only at a low level (33% antigenic ratio), suggesting that IBADAN also represents a new serotype.

This study used high-throughput sequencing to assess the richness and diversity of poultry litter bacterial communities and to search for connections between these communities and the environmental characteristics of a poultry house, including its history of gangrenous dermatitis (GD). Cluster analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed differences in the distribution of bacterial phylotypes between wet and dry litter samples and between houses. The wet litter contained a higher diversity with 90% of the total bacterial abundance within the 214 major groups of OTUs. In contrast, only 50 clusters accounted for 90% of the bacterial abundance in dry litter. The sixth largest OTU cluster among all samples classified as Arcobacter sp., an emerging human pathogen, occurring only in wet litter samples from a house with a modern evaporative cooling system. Ironically, the main pathogenic species of clostridia and staphylococci associated with GD were not found in any house; however, there were thirteen 16S rRNA gene phylotypes of mostly Gram-positive phyla that were unique to GD-affected houses and occurred primarily in wet litter samples. Overall, the poultry house environment appeared to have a substantial impact on the composition of bacterial communities in the litter and may play a key role in the emergence of foodborne pathogens. © 2011 Dumas et al.",,"Dumas, M.

537,Molecular and microscopic evidence of viruses in marine copepods,"As dominant members of marine mesozooplankton communities, copepods play critical roles in oceanic food webs and biogeochemical cycling. Despite the ecological importance of copepods, little is known about the causes of copepod mortality, and up to 35% of total copepod mortality cannot be explained by predation alone. Viruses have established themselves as ecologically important infectious agents in the oceans; however, viral infection in mesozooplankton communities has not been investigated. Here we use molecular and microscopic techniques to document viral infection in natural populations of the calanoid copepods Acartia tonsa (Dana) and Labidocera aestiva (Wheeler) in Tampa Bay, FL. Viral metagenomics revealed viruses not previously documented in each species, named Acartia tonsa copepod circus-like virus (AtCopCV) and Labidocera aestiva copepod circus-like virus (LaCopCV). LaCopCV was found to be extremely prevalent and abundant in L. aestiva populations, with a prevalence of up to 100% in some samples and mean viral loads of 1.13 x 10(5) copies per individual. LaCopCV transcript was also detected in the majority of L. aestiva individuals, indicating viral activity. AtCopCV was detected sporadically in A. tonsa populations throughout the year, suggesting temporal variability in the dynamics of viral infection. Finally, virus-like particles of unknown identity were observed in the connective tissues of A. tonsa and L. aestiva by transmission electron microscopy, demonstrating that the viruses were actively proliferating in the connective tissue of copepods rather than infecting the intestinal contents, parasites or symbionts. Taken together, these results provide strong independent lines of evidence for active viral infection in dominant copepod species, indicating that viruses can significantly influence mesozooplankton ecology.",,"Dunlap, D.

538,"Bovine enteroviruses in the calf: an attempt at serological, biological and pathological classification","Bovine enteroviruses have been classified into 8 serotypes to provide a basis for pathogenicity studies. Oral and subcutaneous inoculation of the virus in calves from 1 day to 8 weeks generally resulted in leukopenia and fever. Of 6 colostrum-deprived calves inoculated before receiving their first milk, 3 died; however, a comparable proportion (9/17) of noninoculated colostrum-deprived calves also died. In calves 4 to 8 weeks old exposed to the virus, fever and leukopenia developed, but less than half of the calves developed diarrhea and few died. None of the calves fed colostrum and not inoculated died. Infection of the fetus in utero seemed to be common, judging by the finding of antibodies against one or more bovine enteroviruses in fetuses aborted at 4 months or more of gestation. The antibodies were believed to be of fetal origin. It was postulated that intrauterine infection may contribute to premature death or lack of resistance of the newborn calf to bacterial infection.",,"Dunne, H. W.;Huang, C. M.;Lin, W. J.",1974.0,,,0
539,Characterization of novel bovine leukemia virus (BLV) antisense transcripts by deep sequencing reveals constitutive expression in tumors and transcriptional interaction with viral microRNAs,"Background: Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is a deltaretrovirus closely related to human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1). Cattle are the natural host for BLV where it integrates into B cells, producing a lifelong infection. Most infected animals remain asymptomatic, but after a prolonged latency period, about 5% develop aggressive leukemia/lymphoma, reflecting the disease trajectory of HTLV-1. The mechanisms by which these viruses cause cell transformation remain opaque. In both viruses little or no transcription from the 5'LTR is observed in tumors, however, the proviruses are not transcriptionally silent. In the case of BLV, a group of microRNAs transcribed with RNA polymerase III are highly expressed, while the HBZ antisense transcript of HTLV-1 is consistently found in all tumors examined. Results: Here, using RNA-seq, we show that the BLV provirus also constitutively expresses antisense transcripts in all leukemic and asymptomatic samples examined. The first transcript (AS1) can be alternatively polyadenylated, generating a ~600 bp transcript (AS1-S) and a less abundant ~2200 bp transcript (AS1-L). Alternative splicing creates a ~400 bp second transcript (AS2). The coding potential of AS1-S/L is ambiguous, with a small open reading frame of 264 bp; however, the transcripts are primarily retained in the nucleus, suggesting an lncRNA-like function. The AS1-L transcript overlaps BLV microRNAs and using RNA ligase-mediated (RLM) 5'RACE high-throughput sequencing, we show that RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) cleaves AS1-L. Furthermore, experiments using altered BLV proviruses with the microRNAs deleted or inverted point to additional transcriptional crosstalk between the two viral RNA species. Conclusions: The identification of new antisense viral transcripts shows that the BLV provirus is far from silent in tumors. Furthermore, the consistent expression of these transcripts in leukemic and non-malignant clones points to a vital role in the life cycle of the virus and its tumorigenic potential. Furthermore, cleavage of the AS1-L transcript by BLV-encoded microRNAs and transcriptional crosstalk between the two viral RNA species suggest a shared role in BLV regulation.",,"Durkin, K.;Rosewick, N.;Artesi, M.;Hahaut, V.;Griebel, P.;Arsic, N.;Burny, A.;Georges, M.;Van den Broeke, A.",2016.0,,10.1186/s12977-016-0267-8,0
540,Phylogenetic analysis of beak and feather disease virus in an annular host species complex,"Pathogens have been hypothesized to play an important role in host diversity and speciation. Susceptibility of hybrid hosts to pathogens is thought to be a common phenomenon that could promote host population divergence and subsequently speciation. However, few studies have tested pathogen infection in the hybrid zones of animals while testing co-divergence of pathogens in the host hybridization complex. For 8 years, we studied natural infection by a rapidly evolving single-stranded DNA virus, beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), which infects parrots, exploiting a ring host species complex (Platycercus elegans) in Australia. We found that host subspecies and their hybrids varied markedly in both BFDV prevalence and burden: both hybrid subspecies and phenotypically intermediate subspecies had lower prevalence and burden compared to parental subspecies, while controlling for age. , sex, longitude and latitude of the host, as well as temporal effects. . We sequenced viral isolates across the range, revealing patterns of genomic variation analogous to the Mayr ring species hypothesis, to the best of our knowledge for the first time in any host-pathogen system. Viral phylogeny, geographic location, intraspecific host density, and parrot community diversity and composition did not explain differences in BFDV prevalence or burden between subpopulations. Overall, our analyzes suggest that functional host responses to infection, or strength of infection, differ between subspecies and hybrids. Our findings highlight the role of host hybridization and clines in altering host-pathogen interactions, a dynamic that may have important implications for gene-flow models of speciation, and offer insights into how pathogens may adapt to populations. of divergent hosts.",,"Eastwood, J.

541,Novel Atlantic bottlenose dolphin parainfluenza virus TtPIV-1 clustered with bovine PIV-3 genotype B strains,"Parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV-3) is a common viral infection not only in humans, but also in many other species. Serologic evidence suggests that nearly 100% of children in the United States have been infected with PIV-3 by 5 years of age. Similarly, in cattle, PIV-3 is commonly associated with the bovine respiratory disease complex. A new dolphin PIV-3 (TtPIV-1) was described by Nollens et al. in 2008 of a dolphin diagnosed with an unknown respiratory illness. At that time, TtPIV-1 was found to be very similar to, but distinct from, bovine PIV-3 (BPIV-3). In the present study, similar viral growth kinetics and proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, and CXCL8) production were observed between BPIV-3 and TtPIV-1 in BEAS-2B, MDBK, and Vero cell lines. The initial nomenclature of TtPIV-1 was based on the partial sequence of the fusion and RNA polymerase genes. Based on the similarities we saw with in vitro work, it was important to examine the TtPIV-1 genome in more detail. Whole genome sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed that all six viral genes of TtPIV-1 clustered within the recently described genotype B strains of BPIV-3, and TtPIV-1 is proposed to be reclassified with genotype B strains.

542,"Characterization of the structural proteins of porcine epizootic diarrhea virus, strain CV777","Porcine epizootic diarrhea virus cannot be grown in cell culture; For its characterization, intestinal perfusion material from a pig infected with the CV777 strain had to be used. In isopycnic sucrose gradients, a peak of virus-specific ELISA activity was detected at a density of 1.17 g/ml. Using immunoprecipitation of purified viral material with radioactive iodine followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 3 low molecular weight proteins (20,000 to 32,000 daltons [D]) were found; after nitrocellulose blotting and identification of glycoproteins with concanavalin A and horseradish peroxidase, 1 of the proteins (23,000 D) gave a signal. Another 58,000 D protein was found, which was the only protein that bound an RNA probe. Finally, an 85,000 D protein was visible, associated with minor bands around 110,000 and 135,000 D in most experiments. Using the concanavalin A-blot technique, the same bands were visualized. The demonstration of a polydisperse group of 20,000 to 32,000 D proteins (of which at least 1 is glycosylated), of 85,000 to 135,000 D glycosylated proteins, and of a 58,000 D RNA-binding protein is taken as structural evidence that the swine epizootic Diarrhea virus should be classified with Coronaviridae, regardless of the apparent lack of antigenic relationship to other members of that family.",,"Egberink, H.

543,Detection and molecular characterization of FMD viruses from outbreaks in some northern states of Nigeria 2013-2015,"Control measures for FMDV have not been implemented in Nigeria due to the absence of locally produced vaccines and risk-based testing due to insufficient data on circulating FMDV serotypes/strains. . In 2013-2015, blood and epithelial samples were collected from FMD outbreaks reported in four states (Kaduna, Kwara, Plateau and Bauchi) in northern Nigeria. The seroprevalence of FMDV nonstructural protein (NSP) for outbreaks was estimated to be 80% (72 of 90) and 70% (131 of 188) after the outbreak. Antibodies against FMD virus serotypes O, A, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3 were detected in all states by competitive solid-phase ELISA. The FMD virus genome was detected in 99% (73 of 74) of samples from FMD-affected animals using rRT-PCR, and a cytopathic effect in cell culture was found in 59% (44 of 74) of these samples. Three FMD virus serotypes O, A and SAT2 were isolated and characterized. Phylogenetic evaluations of the isolated viruses showed that two FMD virus serotype O topotypes were circulating, East African-3 (EA-3) and West African (WA) topotypes, as well as FMD virus strains belonging to the Africa genotype (G-IV) of serotype A and strains of FMDV SAT2 topotype VII. While the serotype O (EA-3) strains from Nigeria were most closely related to a 1999 virus strain from Sudan, the WA strain from Nigeria shares a genetic relationship with three 1988 viruses from Niger. The FMD virus serotype A strains were closely related to a known virus from Cameroon, and the SAT2 strains were more closely related to virus subtypes in Libya. This study provides evidence for the coexistence of FMD virus serotypes and topotypes in West, Central, East and North Africa, and this has implications for control. The findings help fill the knowledge gap of FMD virus dynamics in Nigeria and the West African sub-region to support local and regional development of control plans based on vaccination and international risk assessment.",,"Ehizibolo, D.

545,First outbreaks and phylogenetic analyzes of H9N2 avian influenza viruses isolated from poultry flocks in Morocco,"Background: H9N2 avian influenza viruses continue to spread in poultry and wild birds throughout the world. Morocco has just faced its first outbreaks of the H9N2 influenza virus in early 2016 that affected different types of poultry production. After its introduction, the virus spread very quickly throughout the country. Methods: Samples were collected from 11 chicken flocks with high morbidity and mortality rates. Four viruses from broilers and one from broiler breeders were successfully isolated and fully sequenced. Results: Phylogenetic and molecular marker analyzes showed that the Moroccan viruses belonged to the G1 lineage and probably originated in the Middle East. As is known for H9N2 viruses, Moroccan isolates possess several genetic markers that increase virulence in poultry and transmission to humans. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that, under field conditions, H9N2 could have a devastating effect on egg production and mortality and highlighted the lack of surveillance data on the pathogen in the region.",,"El Houadfi, M.;Fellahi, S.;Nassik, S.;GuÃ©rin, J.

547,Detection of the first strain of human rotavirus G6P[14] from a child with diarrhea in Egypt,"We report the first detection of a G6P[14] rotavirus strain in Egypt from the stool of a child who participated in a hospital diarrhea surveillance study conducted during 2004. Rotavirus infection was initially detected by a rotavirus group A VP6 enzyme immunoassay; the P (VP4) and G (VP7) genotypes of the strain were identified by RT-PCR. We sequenced the VP7 gene and the VP8* portion of the VP4 gene and the strain showed the highest identity to VP7 [>94% nucleotides (nt), >97% amino acids (aa)] and VP4 (>93% nt, > 98% aa) of PA169, a new G6P[14] strain first isolated from a child in Italy during the winter of 1987. Further sequencing and analysis of the other remaining structural (VP1-VP3, VP6) and non-structural ( The proteins NSP1-NSP5) support this animal-to-human rearrangement theory. According to the whole genome classification system, strain G6P[14] (EGY3399) was assigned to genotypes G6-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A11-N2-T6-E2-H3. The greatest sequence similarity of the EGY3399 NSP4 and NSP5 genes was with those of sheep and simian origin, respectively. Together with other observations, our results suggest that G6P[14] isolates rarely cause severe diarrhea in Egyptian children and support other studies indicating that animal rotavirus contributes to the genetic diversity of rotavirus detected in humans through inter-infection transmission. species and rearrangement of one or more segments. © 2011.",,"El Sherif, M.;Esona, M.

548,"Avian influenza: Virology, diagnosis and surveillance","Avian influenza virus (AIV) is the causative agent of a zoonotic disease that affects populations around the world with often devastating health and economic consequences. Most AIV subtypes cause little or no disease in waterfowl, but outbreaks in poultry can be associated with high mortality. Although transmission of AIV to humans occurs rarely and is strain dependent, the virus has the ability to mutate or reassort in a way that triggers a life-threatening infection. The constant emergence of new strains of influenza makes it particularly difficult to predict behavior, spread, virulence, or the potential for person-to-person transmission. Because it is difficult to anticipate which viral strain or location will initiate the next pandemic, it is difficult to prepare for that event. However, rigorous implementation of biosecurity, vaccination, and education programs can minimize the threat of AIV. Global surveillance programs help record and identify newly evolving and potentially pandemic strains harbored by the reservoir host. © 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.",,"El Zowalaty, M. E.;Bustin, S.

549,The F gene sequence of ovine respiratory syncytial virus and its diagnostic application,"Ruminant respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) are classified into 2 subgroups, sheep RSV and bovine RSV. Although sheep RSV infects cattle, its contribution to bovine respiratory tract disease has not been established, which is an important issue for vaccine development in cattle. Diagnosis by virus isolation or serology has low or variable sensitivity and/or specificity, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been recommended as a rapid and sensitive technique for RSV detection. A simple procedure has been developed to detect and identify bovine and ovine RSV. First, the nucleotide sequence of the ovine RSV fusion (F) gene was determined and compared with representative strains of bovine RSV subgroups A and B and human RSV. RSV and human RSV, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of the F gene of ovine RSV has 94% and 83-84% amino acid identity with that of bovine RSV and human RSV, respectively. Then, PCR primers targeting a fragment of the F gene specific for bovine and ovine RSV were designed. The primers represented bases 85-103 and the sequence complementary to bases 510-493 of the sheep RSV F gene. A similar PCR product (426 bp) was obtained on agarose gel electrophoresis of bovine RSV and ovine RSV. The products, however, were unique to the parent virus and could be distinguished by EcoRI or MspI restriction endonuclease cleavage. EcoRI split the sheep product into 2 bands (285 and 141 bp) but did not affect the bovine RSV PCR product. However, MspI cleaved the bovine product into 2 bands (229 and 197 bp) but had no effect on the ovine product. In addition, this assay did not amplify any human RSV PCR products. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by restriction enzyme digestion is a useful and practical approach for the detection and differentiation of ruminant respiratory syncytial viruses.",,"Eleraky, N.

Hidden Markov models (HMM), decision trees, and associative classification were generated for each influenza A virus subtype and its main hosts (human, avian, swine). Characteristics of the HA protein signatures that were host- and subtype-specific were sought. Host-associated signatures that occurred in different subtypes of the virus were identified. Evaluation of classification models based on ROC curves and support and confidence indices for amino acid class association rules was performed. Host classification based on HA subtype achieved accuracies between 91.2% and 100% using decision trees after feature selection. Host-specific class association rules for avian-host origins gave better support and trust ratings, followed by human and finally porcine origin. This finding indicated the lower specificity of the porcine host, perhaps pointing to its ability to mix different strains. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,"ElHefnawi, M.;Sherif, F.

558,Viral discovery as a tool for pandemic preparedness,"Emerging diseases are often caused by new or previously unrecognized zoonotic viral pathogens that tend to originate and emerge from wildlife. When human or animal cases are first recognized, there are still no specific molecular or serological diagnostic tests for them, which causes a delay in identifying the etiological agent of an outbreak, as well as its origin. Preparing for the next virus to emerge is a major public health challenge, hampered by a poor understanding of the diversity of potential candidates that exist in wildlife reservoirs. Characterization of virus diversity in key wildlife species will help reduce the time between detection and response in an outbreak situation, and inform public health strategies that reduce the risk of spread from animal reservoirs. Pathogen discovery techniques, such as consensus polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), have been used to identify known and novel viruses in animals and humans, but have not been widely used. in surveillance programs. Metagenomic studies have identified new viruses, new strains of known viruses, and characterized host microbiomes. While NGS represents an unbiased approach to viral sequence detection, it is limited by lower sensitivity than conventional PCR, requires substantial bioinformatics capabilities, and is cost-prohibitive, and is therefore not widely available in regions of the world that are more vulnerable to the appearance of zoonotic diseases. In contrast, consensus PCR uses standard and widely available technologies, has higher sensitivity than NGS, and has also been used to identify novel viruses in wildlife, livestock, and humans, although it is limited to detecting genetic sequences. target conserved in known groups of viruses. The use of cPCR, in combination, if possible, with NGS and serology, can offer a powerful approach to rapidly identify the etiologic agents in an outbreak and characterize the virome of key wildlife known to carry zoonotic viruses.

However, significant discrepancies between reference antisera and field isolates have been observed during serological surveillance of influenza A viruses in pig and poultry farms. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of genetic and antigenic variation of the influenza virus on serological tests using standard HI assays and reference reagents. LPHA H5N2 viruses isolated in Mexico between 1994 and 2008 were used for phylogenetic analysis of AI hemagglutinin genes and for serological testing using antisera raised with year-specific AI virus isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a significant divergence between the earliest LPAI H5N2 viruses (1994 - 1998) and more recent virus field isolates (2002 - 2008). The results of the HI test were markedly influenced by the selection of the AI H5N2 virus (year of isolation) used as the reference antigen for the assay. These analyzes indicate that LPAI H5N2 viruses in Mexico are constantly genetically drifting and that serologic surveillance of AI viruses is significantly influenced by the antigen or antiserum used for HI testing. Reference viral antigens and/or antisera must be constantly replaced during AI virus surveillance to keep pace with AI antigenic drift. This strategy should improve the estimation of antigenic differences between circulating avian influenza viruses and the selection of suitable vaccine strains.",,"Escorcia, M.;Carrillo-SÃ¡nchez, K.;March-Mifsut, S.;Chapa, J.;Lucio, E.;Nava, G.

563,Identification of New Fusion Protein-Based Newcastle Disease Virus Subgenotype VII-(j),"Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is believed to be the cause of fatal diseases in poultry worldwide. The fusion protein (F) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the virus and is also used for the classification of Newcastle disease virus. In this study, we determined the complete coding sequence of the F gene in novel velogenic NDV isolates with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 1.8 and a mean time of death (MDT) of 72 or 48 h. The complete sequences of the F genes of the new Iranian isolates were amplified and sequenced in both directions. These isolates were compared to 195 nucleotide sequences from GenBank (available as of 07/17/2016). A phylogenetic tree for the F gene was constructed using MEGA6 software with statistical analysis based on 500 bootstrap replicates. Evolutionary distances revealed that the new virulent isolates from Iran belonged to genotype VII in a distinct new subgenotype designated VII-(j). This new subgenotype showed a 3% divergence from the VIId genotype. Recombination analysis showed that these new isolates were not recombinant NDV.",,"Esmaelizad, M.;Mayahi, V.;Pashaei, M.;Goudarzi, H.",2017.0,,10.1007/s00705-016-3189-9,0
564,Horsepox (smallpox inoculation): an early alternative to vaccination (cowpox inoculation) and the potential role of smallpox virus in the origin of smallpox vaccine Review,"For almost 150 years after Edward Jenner published ""Inquiry"" in 1798, it was generally assumed that the cowpox virus was the smallpox vaccine. It was not until 1939 that vaccinia, the smallpox vaccine virus, was shown to be serologically related to but different from cowpox virus. In the absence of a known natural host, vaccinia has been considered to be a laboratory virus that may have originated from mutational or recombination events related to cowpox virus, smallpox virus, or some unknown ancestral orthopoxvirus. . A favorite candidate for a vaccinia ancestor has been the horsepox virus. Edward Jenner himself suspected that cowpox was derived from horsepox and also believed that ""stuff"" obtained from either disease could be used as a smallpox preventative. During the 19th century, cowpox inoculation (vaccination) was used in Europe along with horsepox (horsepox) inoculation to prevent smallpox. Vaccine manufacturing practices during the 19th century may have resulted in the use of mixtures of viruses, leading to different genetic modifications resulting in today's vaccinia strains. Smallpox, a disease previously reported only in Europe, has been disappearing on that continent since the early 20th century and now appears to be extinct, though the virus may still be circulating in an unknown reservoir. Genomic sequencing of a horsepox virus isolated in Mongolia in 1976 indicated that, while closely related to vaccinia, this horsepox virus contained additional potentially ancestral sequences absent in vaccinia. Recent genetic analyzes of extant vaccinia viruses have revealed that some strains contain ancestral horsepox virus genes or are phylogenetically related to horsepox virus. We recently reported that a commercially produced smallpox vaccine, manufactured in the United States in 1902, is genetically very similar to horsepox virus, providing a missing link in this 200-year-old mystery.",,"Esparza, J.;Schrick, L.;Damaso, C.

565,Orthopoxvirus DNA: strain differentiation by restriction endonuclease fragmented virion DNA electrophoresis,"Procedures were developed to purify intact intracytoplasmic poxvirus particles from infected cells and to isolate DNA from virions by equilibrium centrifugation in sodium diatrizoate density gradients. The buoyant density of twelve closely related orthopoxviruses purified on these gradients was determined to be 1.25 g/ml, and that of isolated virion DNAs was 1.1 g/ml. Virion DNA from each of the 12 selected prototype and wild-type viruses was cleaved with three separate site-specific restriction endonucleases, Hin d III, Sal I, and Bam HI, and the fragments (molecular weights of 0.5 x 106 to 20 x 106) were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The migration patterns of characteristic DNA fragments observed in the gels allowed the classification of the viruses. By comparing the profiles of the Hin d III cleaved DNAs, we were able to group the viruses into 4 species: cowpox, vaccinia, monkeypox (2 isolates), and smallpox (8 isolates). Variola major infection viruses could be differentiated from variola minor infection viruses. Isolates were also differentiated within species (strains), primarily by comparing gel electrophoresis profiles of Sal I-digested DNA of the viruses.",,"Esposito, J. J.;Obijeski, J. F.;Nakano, J.

566,Poxvirus zoonóticos,"Poxviruses comprise a long-known group of important pathogens, including some zoonotic members that affect animals and humans. While whole genome sequence analysis has begun to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell infection, viral replication, and virulence, our understanding of poxvirus maintenance in nature and its transmission to humans has yet to improve. it is deficient. Over the past two decades, reports of emerging outbreaks of human monkeypox in Africa and North America, the increasing number of cowpox virus infections in cats, exotic animals, and humans, and cases of infections by vaccinia virus in humans in South America and India reminded us that, in addition to the eradicated smallpox virus - there are other poxviruses that can cause harm to humans. We are beginning to learn that the host range of some poxviruses is much broader than initially thought and that mainly rodents seem to function as virus reservoirs. The following review aims to provide an updated overview on the epidemiology of zoonotic poxviruses, with an emphasis on orthopoxviruses. By outlining current knowledge on poxvirus transmission, we hope to raise awareness of modes of infection acquisition and proper diagnosis. © 2009 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Essbauer, S.;Pfeffer, M.;Meyer, H.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.08.026,0
567,Antigenic and genetic relationships between European highly virulent infectious bursal disease viruses and a primitive West African isolate,"The antigenic and genetic relationships between highly virulent (vv) infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDV) from different countries were investigated. Antigenic characterization was performed using an antigen capture ELISA based on a panel of seven neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Mabs), which probe at least three antigenic domains located in VP2. All of these domains are reactive in the reference strain Faragher 52/70 (F52/70) for classical European serotype 1 IBDV. Genomic characterization was achieved by reverse transcription, amplification, and direct sequencing of a genome fragment encoding the VP2 variable domain. Eleven vv isolates from France were compared with the British, Dutch, and Belgian viruses UK661, DV86, and 849VB, and with an early vv isolate obtained from the Ivory Coast in 1988. All viruses exhibited antigenic profiles characterized by the absence of Mab 3 binding. and 4. Therefore, the non-binding of Mab 3 and 4 could be useful in differentiating classic IBDV and vv. None of the non-French strains resembled French isolates 91168 and 94432, which did not bind Mabs 6, 7, or 8. Genetic analysis revealed close relationships. among all European viruses, they differed from each other by no more than 12 nucleotides and 3 amino acids. The African isolate was markedly different, with at least 22 nucleotides and six amino acids different from all European viruses, including the F52/70 virus. Phylogenetic analysis based on parsimony and neighbor-joining methods suggest that the African virus may belong to a genetically distinct lineage of highly pathogenic IBDV.",,"Eterradossi, N.;Arnauld, C.;Tekaia, F.;Toquin, D.;Le Coq, H.;Rivallan, G.;Guittet, M.;Domenech, J.;van den Berg, T.

569,Antigenic characterization of hepatitis virus with inclusion bodies,"Proof that chicken inclusion body hepatitis (IBHC) is caused by a virus (IBHV) was established in 1973. Characterization of IBHV has been performed using standard criteria for virus classification. The results have indicated that IBHV is a member of the avian adenovirus group. However, no antigenic relationship was found between IBHV and two other avian adenovirus isolates (CELO and Indiana C) as observed by hemagglutination (HA) and virus serum neutralization tests. Another adenovirus isolate was found to be serologically different from IBHV (Tipton strain) but to cause typical IBHV. This antigen was able to give a specific precipitin reaction with sera from chickens previously exposed to IBHV. Repeated passage of the IBHV embryo reduced its pathogenicity for susceptible chickens. Protection of chickens against IBHV challenge was obtained by vaccination with high embryonic passage IBHV (Tipton strain). It was also found that the subcutaneous administration of the vaccinia virus induced a better immune response than the eye drop route, as observed by the virus serum neutralization index obtained.",,"Fadly, A.

570,Reappearance of the Peste des Petits Rumiants virus in 2015 in Morocco: Molecular characterization and experimental infection in alpine goats,"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a transboundary viral disease of small ruminants that causes huge economic losses in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. In Morocco, the first PPR outbreak was reported in 2008. Since then, no cases have been reported for seven years, probably due to three successive vaccination campaigns during 2008-2011 and close surveillance in border areas. In June 2015, the disease resurfaced in Morocco, raising questions about the origin of the virus. PPR virus was confirmed by qRT-PCR and the virus was isolated from clinical samples on VeroNectin-4 cells. The disease was experimentally reproduced in alpine goats using isolates from outbreaks derived from sheep and goats. Molecular characterization of the 2015 Moroccan PPR isolate confirmed the identity of the virus as lineage IV, closely related to the 2012 Algerian (KP793696) and 2012 Tunisian (KM068121) isolates and significantly different from the earlier Morocco 2008 PPRV strain.

572,Frequency of bovine viral diarrhea virus detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cell subpopulations in persistently infected animals and health outcome,"Bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV) cause acute and persistent infections. Acute infection results in generalized immunosuppression characterized by a decrease in circulating lymphocytes as a result of depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations. Persistent infection with BVDV is the result of immunological tolerance and is not usually associated with lymphocytopenia. The health outcome of persistently infected (PI) calves varies widely; some die from mucosal diseases, some succumb to the bad economy, and others appear normal and survive into adulthood. Detection of BVDV at the level of individual lymphoid cells is important for studying peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subpopulations during BVDV infections; however, few methods are available for the detection and quantification of BVDV at this level. To circumvent this difficulty, a new flow cytometry-based PrimeFlow RNA assay using in situ detection of BVDV was developed. This assay was used to assess differences in viral distribution within PBMC subpopulations over time in PI calves carrying one of two different BVDV species (type 1 and type 2). Calves were sampled at 3 different time points approximately one month apart. During the course of the study, a subset of the calves died from lack of sparing. Mucosal disease was not indicated in any of the deaths. Using RNA probes specific for the N<sup>pro</sup>-E<sup>rns</sup> coding regions of BVDV for each respective virus, BVDV RNA was detected in all PBMC from PI that appeared clinically healthy. . Calves that succumbed to the poor economy were found to have little or no virus in their T cells. Elimination of virus from T cells suggests a failure of immune tolerance in these calves. This is the first report of an observed pattern in viral load in T cell subpopulations and survival in PI calves.",,"Falkenberg, S. M.;Dassanayake, R. P.;Walz, P.;Casas, E.;Neill, J. D.;Ridpath, J.

To identify the cause of PR outbreaks, especially among vaccinated pigs, 11 field strains of pseudorabies virus (PRV) were isolated from Guangdong province during 2013-2014. In this study, its main viral genes (gE, TK, gI, PK, gD, 11K and 28K) were analyzed. Insertions or deletions in the gD, gE, gI and PK genes were observed compared to other PRV isolates from around the world. Furthermore, the sequence alignment showed that the insertions in gD and gE were unique molecular features of the new PRV strains prevalent in China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that our isolates clustered in an independent branch together with other isolates from China in recent years, and that they showed a closer genetic relationship with earlier isolates from Asia. Our results suggest that these isolates are novel PRV variants with unique molecular signatures.",,"Fan, J.;Zeng, X.;Zhang, G.;Wu, Q.;Niu, J.;Sun, B.;Xie, Q.;Ma, J.",2016.0,,10.4142/jvs.2016.17.3.369,0

Analyzes included examination of the phylogenetic tree, evolutionary rates, amino acid substitutions, egg-adapted mutation, and homology modeling. We found differences between egg-adapted viruses and MDCK cell-derived viruses based on phylogenetic trees and evolutionary rates; the viruses showed a trend of ""NA>HA>MP"". Four amino acid substitutions (Q223R, V527 I, M19I and H275Y) were found in three egg-adapted viruses. Q223 R and V527I were present in the hemagglutinin protein, while M19I and H275Y were detected in the neuraminidase. The Q223R mutation changed the structure of the antigenic sites between Sb and Ca2. H275Y is a classic neuraminidase resistance mutation. The results suggest that egg-adapted mutations were introduced when influenza viruses were isolated from chick embryos from the Hubei influenza surveillance network. These mutations may affect the selection of vaccine candidates and the efficacy of the vaccine; therefore, monitoring of egg-adapted mutations in the influenza surveillance network should be strengthened.",,"Fang, B.;Liu, L.;Ye, G.;Li, X.;Yu, X.;Jiang, Y.",2016.0,,,0

Therefore, many PIPs undoubtedly identify positions involved in virus-host interactions. Phylogenetically important regions (PIRs) are defined as several PIPs close to each other. There are 15 PIRs in N1 and 12 in N2, seven of which are shared between the two subtypes. Many PIRs coincide with antigenic or glycosylation sites.

577,Selection of vaccine strains of foot-and-mouth disease virus for use in southern Africa,"In southern African countries, FMD virus types SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 (SAT: Southern African Territories) are the most represented, especially SAT 2 virus. 139 isolates of these types of viruses. Other viruses, type O and A, have been detected in the north of this area. Virus typing and subtyping with the complement fixation (CF) test can be improved by the use of monoclonal antibody panels (MAbs), which provide an accurate antigenic profile of a new strain. A total of 33 SAT 2 strains have been investigated using MAbs and the results allow the viruses to be classified into groups with the same profile. The author presents comparisons of vaccine isolates and viruses using conventional serotyping methods (CF and virus neutralization (VN) tests), as well as profiles of isolates using MAbs. Both forms of analysis provide information about relationships between viruses. The CF and VN tests provide details on how animals responded against a particular isolate and how this antibody response would recognize another isolate; From this, serological relationships can be proposed regarding how different isolates might induce a humoral immune response. With MAb profiling, details of the antigenic relationships between isolates are obtained, allowing the identification of individual epitopic variations. These analyzes may provide the potential to place different isolates into 'antigenic' groups. When compared with vaccine viruses, one can try to identify the vaccine virus with the closest profile to the isolated group. Immunological analysis (eg, using the CF tests used in this paper) can provide more information about the relationship between a particular vaccine and an antigenic group identified by MAb profiling. Of course, this MAb profile can provide essential information in a very short time, which is especially beneficial in an emergency situation. Confirmation of the profiling conclusions would then be obtained through serological analysis. Such combined analyzes offer a broader identification of antigenic and immunogenic relationships between FMD virus isolates, as well as between isolates and vaccine viruses.",,"Fargeaud, D.",1995.0,,,0
578,Intraepidemic genome variation in highly pathogenic African swine fever virus (ASFV) from the country of Georgia,"BACKGROUND: African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes an acute hemorrhagic infection in suidae with a mortality rate of up to 100%. There is no vaccine available and the potential for catastrophic disease in Europe remains high due to the ongoing African swine fever epidemic in Russia and the Baltic countries. To date, intraepidemic variation of the entire genome of African swine fever virus has not been reported. To provide a more complete baseline for genetic variation early in the African swine fever outbreak, we sequenced two Georgian African swine fever virus samples, G-2008/1 and G-2008/2, derived from domestic pig blood. collected in 2008. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted directly from low-volume ASFV PCR-positive porcine blood samples and subjected to next-generation sequencing on the Illumina Miseq platform. Mapped and de novo sequence assemblies were performed using CLCBio software. Genomic illustrations, sequence alignments, and assembly figures were generated using Geneious v10.2.4. Sequence repeat architecture was analyzed using DNASTAR GeneQuest 14.1.0. RESULTS: The G-2008/1 and G-2008/2 genomes differed from each other by encoding changes in seven genes, including MGF 110-1 L, X69R, MGF 505-10R, EP364R, H233R, E199L, and MGF 360-21R. plus eight homopolymer tract variations. The 2008/2 genome possessed a new allele state at a previously undescribed intergenic repeat locus between the C315R and C147L genes. The C315R/C147L locus represents the earliest observed variable repeat sequence polymorphism reported among isolates from this epidemic. No sequence variation was observed in conventional ASFV subtyping markers. The two genomes exhibited complete collinearity and gene content identical to that of the Georgia 2007/1 reference genome. Approximately 56 unique variations of the homopolymer A/T tract were identified that were unique to the Georgia 2007/1 genome. In both 2008 genomes, within-sample sequence read heterogeneity was evident in six homopolymeric G/C stretches confined to the known ~7 kb hypervariable region in the left terminal region of the genome. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported intraepidemic comparative genomic analysis for ASFV and provides insights into the intraepidemic microevolution of ASFV. The genomes reported here, in addition to the G-2007/1 genome, provide an early baseline for future genome-level comparisons and epidemiological tracking efforts.",,"Farlow, J.;Donduashvili, M.;Kokhreidze, M.;Kotorashvili, A.;Vepkhvadze, N.

579,Detection of foreign agents in vaccines: a review of the technical aspects,"The quality and safety of commercial vaccines are of great importance. Contrary to all precautions and efforts, the use of biological material in vaccine development and production can lead to potential contamination of vaccines with known and unknown foreign agents (EAs). In the veterinary field, official AE lists have been compiled as a legal framework to describe potential agents, which must be tested during vaccine manufacturing. However, detection of known and unknown contaminants in vaccines is a common duty for manufacturers and authorities in the veterinary and human fields who share similar needs for special technical approaches. State-of-the-art molecular methods, such as random primed PCR combined with massively parallel sequencing (MPS) or microarrays, may open up new perspectives in foreign agent testing. The robustness and effectiveness of this technical approach in vaccine control was clearly demonstrated in an example of a human vaccine when porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) contamination was revealed in Rotarix, a human rotavirus vaccine.

580,Xenosurveillance mirrors traditional sampling techniques for human pathogen identification: a comparative study in West Africa,"Background New surveillance strategies are needed to detect the rapid and continuous emergence of infectious disease agents. Ideally, new sampling strategies should be simple to implement, technologically straightforward, and applicable to areas where emergency events are known to occur. To this end, xenosurveillance is a technique that makes use of blood collected by hematophagous arthropods to monitor and identify vertebrate pathogens. Mosquitoes are largely ubiquitous animals that often exist in sizeable populations. Additionally, many species of domestic or peridomestic mosquitoes will prefer to feed on the blood of humans, making them a unique and largely untapped reservoir for collecting human blood. Methodology/ Main Findings We sought to take advantage of this phenomenon by systematically collecting blood-fed mosquitoes during a field trial in northern Liberia to determine whether pathogen sequences from blood-fed mosquitoes accurately mirror those obtained directly from humans. Specifically, blood was collected from humans through finger pricks and by vacuuming blood-fed mosquitoes from inside homes. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of RNA and DNA derived from these specimens was performed to detect pathogen sequences. Samples obtained from xenosurveillance and fingerstick blood collection produced a similar quantity and quality of reads that aligned with two human viruses, GB C virus and hepatitis B virus. Conclusions/Significance This study represents the first systematic comparison between xenosurveillance and more traditional sampling methodologies, while also demonstrating the feasibility of xenosurveillance as a tool for sampling human blood for circulating pathogens.",,"Fauver, J.

The emergence of new viruses is attributed to the coexistence of multiple virus types and subtypes in the reservoir hosts. For effective prediction of future viral epidemics or pandemics, a thorough understanding of virome status in key reservoir species is highly essential. METHODS: To obtain an unbiased measure of viral diversity in the enteric tract of ducks using a viral metagenomics approach, we sequenced viral nucleic acid extracted from cloacal swabs collected from the flock of 23 ducks that shared water bodies with birds. wild migrants. RESULT: In total, 7,455,180 reads with an average length of 146 bases were generated, of which 7,354,300 reads were assembled de novo into 24,945 contigs with an average length of 220 bases and the remaining 100,880 reads were singletons. The duck virome was identified by sequence similarity comparisons of contigs and singletons (BLASTx E score, <10(-3)) against the viral reference database. Numerous duck virome sequences were homologous to animal viruses of the Papillomaviridae family; and phages from the families Caudovirales, Inoviridae, Tectiviridae, Microviridae and unclassified phages. In addition, several duck virome sequences had homology to insect viruses in the families Poxviridae, Alphatetraviridae, Baculoviridae, Densovirinae, Iflaviridae, and Dicistroviridae; and plant viruses of the families Secoviridae, Virgaviridae, Tombusviridae, and Partitiviridae, reflecting the diet and habitat of ducks.

The spatial distribution of their larvae and the feeding preferences of the females were investigated to assess the potential role of each form in the spread of the virus. The taxonomic status of mosquitoes was determined from their autogenicity (543 specimens) and mitochondrial DNA type (348 specimens). Form pipiens mosquitoes were shown to develop in urban and rural open reservoirs and females were not autogenous. Cx. pipiens form molestus was found only in urban biotopes, mainly in flooded basements and, in some years, also in open reservoirs where it formed a mixed population with Cx. pipiens form pipiens. Among the females with the molestus form mitotype, both autogenous (85-95.2%) and non-autogenous specimens were identified. Genetic analysis of Cx. Pipiens females collected under Berezantsev's bell and in the trap with a bird showed that both forms were attracted to man and bird.

This study did not demonstrate an association between gyrovirus shedding from ferrets and observed background disease; however, it provides evidence of genetic diversity among gyroviruses and raises the possibility that domestic ferrets may transmit gyroviruses to heterologous hosts, eg, humans.",,"FehÃ©r, E.;PazÃ¡r, P.;KovÃ¡cs, E.;Farkas, S.

585,Analysis of the genome sequence of a virus characteristic of the infectious disease Italian bursitis,"In a recent study, an emerging genotype (ITA) of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) was detected in broilers vaccinated with live IBDV virus without clinical signs of infectious bursal disease (IBD). Sequence analysis of VP2 showed that ITA genotype strains clustered separately from vaccine strains and from other IBDV reference strains, either classical or highly virulent. In order to obtain a more exhaustive molecular characterization of the IBDV ITA genotype and to speculate on its origin, the genome sequencing of the field isolate IBDV/Italy/1829/2011, previously assigned to the ITA genotype, was performed and the sequences were compared. obtained. to the corresponding sequences currently available. In addition, phylogenetic and recombination analyzes were performed. Interestingly, multiple amino acid (AA) sequence alignments revealed that the IBDV/Italy/1829/2011 strain shared several AA residues with highly virulent IBDV strains, as well as some virulence markers, especially in the VP1 protein. However, sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of several residues typical of IBDV strains with a low degree of virulence in the IBDV/Italy/1829/2011 strain. Although homologous recombination and reassortment phenomena can occur naturally between different IBDV strains, no evidence of such events was found in the genome of the IBDV/Italy/1829/2011 strain, which was confirmed as a genetically distinctive IBDV genotype.",,"Felice, V.;Franzo, G.;Catelli, E.;Di Francesco, A.;Bonci, M.;Cecchinato, M.;Mescolini, G.;Giovanardi, D.;Pesente, P.;Lupini, C.",2017.0,,10.3382/ps/pex278,0
586,First evaluation of the candidate classical swine fever marker vaccine CP7_E2alf for oral immunization of wild boar under field conditions,"Oral vaccination against classical swine fever (CSF) is a powerful tool to control outbreaks of the disease in wild boar. Until now, vaccination campaigns have been carried out with live attenuated vaccines that do not allow serological differentiation between infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA). Although this drawback is acceptable for wild boar, the use of marker vaccines would facilitate studies on the dynamics of the disease and vaccination. Recently, oral immunization under laboratory conditions of the CSF marker vaccine candidate CP7_E2alf was evaluated. Promising results prompted efforts to study the candidate vaccine under field conditions and in bait formulation. In this context, two oral vaccination campaigns with CP7_E2alf bait vaccines were carried out in two areas called 'fauna hunting farms' in the Umbria region, Italy. One campaign was carried out with single vaccination, the second with the routinely used double vaccination strategy. Both campaigns were carried out before concerted hunting actions were carried out. Bait uptake, vaccine virus detection, and antibody responses were evaluated along with inspections during evisceration. As a comparison, seven wild boars were hand-fed baits under laboratory conditions. In the field, bait uptake ranged from 63.7% to 98.7%, while antibody prevalence reached only 33.3-35.1%. The marker serology showed a strong influence of the sample quality on the test result with a total of 85% of the samples classified correctly. The vaccine virus was not detectable. Under hand-feeding conditions, six of seven wild boars took at least one bait, and five of them showed detectable levels of antibodies seven weeks after vaccination. These results were complemented with stability tests. Adequate stability of the vaccine virus was demonstrated under both field and laboratory conditions. In total, most results were in line with our expectations. However, optimization of the DIVA assay should be attempted in the future. © 2014.",,"Feliziani, F.;Blome, S.;Petrini, S.;Giammarioli, M.;Iscaro, C.;Severi, G.;Convito, L.;Pietschmann, J.;Beer, M.;De Mia, G.

587,Colocalization and interaction between glycoprotein H and L of duck enteritis virus,"Background: Duck enteritis virus (DEV), belonging to the α-herpesvirus subfamily, is a linear double-stranded DNA virus. Glycoproteins H and L (gH and gL), encoded by UL22 and UL1, are conserved in the herpesvirus family. They play important roles as gH/gL dimers during viral entry into host cells through cell-cell fusion. The interaction between gH and gL has been confirmed in several human herpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). In this article, we study the interaction between DEV gH and gL. Results: Recombinant plasmids pEGFP-N-gH and pDsRED-N-gL were successfully constructed. Expressions of DEV gH and gL were observed after incubation of COS-7 cells transfected with plasmids pEGFP-N-gH and pDsRED-N-gL after 12 h, respectively. In addition, co-localization of a proportion of gH and gL in the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells was detected after co-transfection for 24 h. Then, the recombinant plasmids pCMV-Flag-gL and pCMV-Myc-gH were constructed and co-transfected into COS-7 cells. Both gH and gL were shown to be tested positive by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated not only the colocalization of DEV gH and gL in COS-7 cells, but also the interaction between them. It will provide insight for further studies in terms of protein-protein interaction in DEV.",,"Feng, D.;Cui, M.;Jia, R.;Liu, S.;Wang, M.;Zhu, D.;Chen, S.;Liu, M.;Zhao, X.;Wu, Y.;Yang, Q.;Yin, Z.;Cheng, A.",2018.0,,10.1186/s12917-018-1553-6,0
588,Analysis of the S1 gene of avian infectious bronchitis virus isolated in southern China during 2011-2012.,"Sixty-two avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains were isolated from sick chickens in different farms in southern China during 2011-2012, and 66.1% of the isolated strains were associated with typical nephritis. Analysis of the amplified S1 gene sequences from the 62 isolates along with the 40 reference strains published in Genbank showed nucleotide homologies ranging from 63.5 to 99.9% and amino acid homologies from 57.9%. and 100%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all Chinese IBV strains clustered into six distinct genetic groups (I-VI). Most of the isolates belonged to group I, and the isolation of group V strains increased compared to a previous surveillance period. The current vaccine strains used in China (H120, H52, W93, and Ma5) formed the Mass group, which is evolutionarily distant from the Chinese isolates. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of S1 revealed diverse and polymorphic substitutions, insertions, and deletions, and the S1 protein of the major pandemic strains contained 540 amino acids with a cleavage site sequence of HRRRR or RRF(L/S)RR. Further analysis showed that the recombination events formed a new subgroup. Taken together, these findings suggest that several IBV variants were circulating and undergoing genetic evolution in southern China during the observation period. Therefore, continuous long-term surveillance is significantly important for the prevention and control of IBV infection. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"Feng, K.;Xue, Y.;Wang, F.;Chen, F.;Shu, D.;Xie, Q.",2014.0,,10.1007/s11262-014-1097-1,0

Picornavirus infections activate a cytosolic RNA sensor, MDA5, which in turn induces a type I interferon response, a crucial component of antiviral immunity. In addition, picornaviruses activate the formation of stress granules (SG), large aggregates of mRNP (messenger ribonucleoprotein particles) preassembled to temporarily store these molecules in the event of cellular stress. Meanwhile, picornaviruses actively suppress these antiviral responses to ensure efficient replication.

A total of 626 patients diagnosed with HFMD in Shanghai, China from January 2012 to September 2013 were enrolled in this study. Of these, 292 cases infected with CVA6 underwent clinical analysis. Phylogenetic, recombination and whole genome sequencing analyzes were also performed. A monophyletic recombinant CVA6 lineage was found during an outbreak of CVA6-associated HFMD in Shanghai, China, in November 2012, and represented 21.9% (64/292) of CVA6 isolates during the study period. Recombination analyzes showed that the 2C gene of the new CVA6 virus was probably derived from a strain of coxsackievirus A4 (CVA4) circulating in the population. Clinical observation showed that this recombinant CVA6 virus caused a more generalized rash than the non-recombinant CVA6 virus.

593,Influenza D virus pathogenia in cattle,"UNLABELED: Cattle have been proposed as a natural reservoir for a new member of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses, which has been tentatively classified as influenza D virus (IDV). Although isolated from diseased animals, it is not clear whether IDV causes any clinical disease in cattle. To address this aspect of Koch's postulates, three dairy calves (treatment animals) kept in individual pens were inoculated intranasally with IDV strain D/bovine/Mississippi/C00046N/2014. One day after inoculation, one seronegative calf (contact animal) was added to each of the treatment animal pens. Cattle in the treatment and contact groups seroconverted and virus was detected in their respiratory tract. Histologically, there was a significant increase in neutrophil tracking in the tracheal epithelium of treated calves compared to control animals. Although infected and contact animals demonstrated various symptoms of respiratory tract infection, these were mild and calves in the treatment group did not differ from controls in terms of heart rate, respiratory rate, or rectal temperature. To mimic zoonotic transmission, two ferrets were exposed to a plastic toy fomite soaked with infected nasal discharge from treated calves. These ferrets did not shed virus or seroconvert. In summary, this study demonstrates that IDV causes mild respiratory disease following experimental infection of cattle and can be effectively transmitted between cattle by in-pen contact, but not from cattle to ferrets through fomite exposure. These findings support the hypothesis that cattle are a natural reservoir of the virus. SIGNIFICANCE: A new influenza virus, tentatively classified as influenza D virus (IDV), has been identified in pigs, cattle, sheep, and goats. Among these hosts, cattle have been proposed as a natural reservoir. In this study, we show that cattle experimentally infected with IDV can shed the virus and transmit it to other cattle through direct contact, but not to ferrets via fomites. IDV caused minor clinical signs in infected cattle, fulfilling another of Koch's postulates for this new agent, although other objective clinical endpoints were not different from control animals. Although the disease observed was mild, IDV induced neutrophil tracking and epithelial attenuation in the trachea of cattle, which could facilitate co-infection with other pathogens and, in doing so, predispose animals to bovine respiratory disease.",,"Ferguson, L.;Olivier, A.

594,Molecular and phylogenetic characterization based on the complete genome of a virulent Newcastle disease virus pathotype isolated in the 1970s in Brazil,"Newcastle disease (ND) is caused by avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) or Newcastle disease virus (NDV) which comprises a diverse group of viruses with a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome. ND is one of the most important diseases of chickens, since it severely affects poultry production worldwide. In the 1970s, outbreaks of virulent ND were reported in Brazil and the NDV strain APMV-1/Chicken/Brazil/SJM/75 (SJM) was isolated. This strain was characterized as highly pathogenic for chickens but not pathogenic for other bird species. Here we present the complete genome of the NDV strain SJM and investigate the phylogenetic relationships of this virus with other NDV strains in terms of genome and protein composition, as well as characterizing its evolutionary process. NDV strain SJM is classified as a velogenic virus and the complete genome is 15,192 nucleotides long and consists of six genes in the order 3'-NP-PMF-HN-L-5'. The presence of the main pathogenic determinant of the NDV strains (112R-RQK-Râ†“F117) was identified in the Fusion protein of the NDV strain SJM. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis classified the NDV strain SJM as a member of class II, genotype V, and indicates that this virus helps us understand the evolutionary process of the strains belonging to this genotype. This study contributes to the growing interest in characterizing NDV isolates to improve our current understanding of the epidemiology, surveillance, and evolution of pathogenic strains. © 2014 The authors.",,"Fernandes, C.

595,Molecular detection of bovine Norovirus in Argentine dairy calves: Circulation of a new tentative genotype,"Bovine noroviruses are enteric pathogens detected in fecal samples from diarrheal and non-diarrheal calves from several countries around the world. However, epidemiological information on bovine noroviruses is still lacking for many major cattle-producing countries in South America. In this study, three bovine norovirus genogroup III sequences were determined by conventional RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing in feces of diarrheal dairy calves from Argentina (B4836, B4848, and B4881, all collected in 2012). Phylogenetic studies based on a partial coding region for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, 503 nucleotides) of these three samples suggested that two of them (B4836 and B4881) belong to genotype 2 (GIII.2) while the third (B4848 ) was more closely related to genotype 1 strains (GIII.1). Using deep sequencing, the capsid region of two of these strains could be determined. This confirmed the circulation of genotype 1 (B4848) along with the presence of another sequence (B4881) that shares its closest genetic relationship with genotype 1, but is distant enough to constitute a new genotype. This latter strain was shown in silico to be recombinant: phylogenetic divergence was detected between its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coding sequence (genotype GIII.2) and its capsid protein coding sequence (genotype GIII.1 or a potential genotype of norovirus). According to these data, this strain could be the second recombinant bovine norovirus of genotype GIII.2_GIII.1 described in the literature worldwide. Further analysis suggested that this strain might even be a potential norovirus GIII genotype, tentatively named GIII.4. The data provide important epidemiological and evolutionary information on bovine noroviruses circulating in South America.",,"Ferragut, F.;Vega, C.

596,Oligonucleotide microarray for influenza A virus subtyping,"BACKGROUND: Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on the antigenic properties of their two external glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Sixteen subtypes of HA and nine of NA are known. Lately, the circulation of some subtypes (H7N7, H5N1) has been closely watched due to the epidemiological threat they present. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the potential of using gel-based microarray technology for rapid and sensitive molecular subtyping of influenza A virus. METHODS: The method employs a microarray of 3D gel-based elements containing immobilized probes. HA and NA gene segments are amplified by multiplex RT-PCR and then hybridized to the microarray. RESULTS: The developed microarray was validated using a panel of 21 known reference strains of influenza virus. The selected strains represented different HA and NA subtypes derived from avian, porcine, and human hosts. The entire procedure takes 10 hours and allows the identification of 15 subtypes of HA and two subtypes of NA. Forty-one clinical samples isolated during bird drops in Novosibirsk (Russia, 2005) were successfully identified using the proposed technique. The sensitivity and specificity of the method were 76% and 100%, respectively, compared to 'gold standard' techniques (virus isolation followed by characterization by immunoassay).

597,"Epidemiological investigation and analysis of non-primate hepacivirus NS5B gene and protein variability in several horse cohorts in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.","Among the recently described hepacivirus species, non-primate hepacivirus/hepacivirus A found in horses and donkeys is closely related to human hepatitis C virus (HCV). Therefore, the equine is an attractive surrogate large animal model for studying HCV therapy, pathogenesis, and prophylaxis. Despite global efforts, epidemiological and genetic studies have not clarified the risk factors, virus distribution, or genetic variability of hepacivirus A, which are also important issues for equine welfare. Little information is available on this background scenario in Brazil. The objectives of this study were to investigate possible risk factors associated with hepacivirus A infection among different cohorts of horses throughout the state of Rio de Janeiro and to assess the diversity of the NS5B viral gene and protein. Hepacivirus A RNA was detected in horse cohorts from all geographic mesoregions, regardless of horse activity or breed investigated. Statewide prevalence ranged from 4.0% to 27.5%. Potential risk factors, such as geographic location and age of mares, were significantly associated with the presence of virus RNA. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the circulation of subtype 2 in all mesoregions. NS5B gene sequences were grouped according to geographic origin, while NS5B fragments did not allow discriminant analysis. The predicted NS5B protein showed marked conservation, especially in the thumb domain. In conclusion, the higher frequency of detection of hepacivirus A RNA in horses raised for breeding purposes, as well as in young females, suggests a direct link between breeding practices and the spread of the virus.

Environmental changes and deforestation have severely affected many ecosystems, intensifying contact between wildlife and humans. In recent years, bats have been found to harbor a number of different viruses with zoonotic potential, as well as a great diversity of astroviruses, for which the question of zoonotic potential remains unanswered to date. Human astroviruses have been identified as the causative agent of diarrhea in children and immunocompromised patients. For a long time, astroviruses have been considered strictly species-specific. However, great genetic diversity has recently been discovered between animal and human astroviruses which could indicate the potential of these viruses to cross species barriers. Furthermore, our knowledge about the tissue tropism of astroviruses has been extended to some neurotropic strains that have recently been shown to be responsible for encephalitis in humans and cattle. This review provides an overview of what is known about astroviruses in bats, humans, and livestock, especially cattle and pigs.

609,"Genomic analysis of the multihost pathogen Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae reveals extensive recombination, as well as the existence of three generalist clades with wide geographic distribution.","BACKGROUND: Knowledge about how bacterial populations are structured is an important prerequisite for studying their ecology and evolutionary history and facilitates research on host specificity, pathogenicity, geographic dispersal, and molecular epidemiology. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is an opportunistic pathogen that is currently making a resurgence in the pig and poultry industries worldwide. This bacterium causes sporadic deaths in captive marine mammals and has recently been implicated in large-scale wildlife die-offs. However, despite its economic relevance and wide geographic and host distribution, including zoonotic potential, the global diversity, recombination rates, and population structure of this bacterium remain poorly characterized. In this study, we performed a large-scale genomic comparison of E. rhusiopathiae based on a diverse collection of isolates to address these knowledge gaps. RESULTS: Eighty-three E. rhusiopathiae isolates from a variety of host species and geographic origins, isolated between 1958 and 2014, were sequenced and assembled using reference-based mapping and de novo assembly. We found that a high proportion of the core genome (58%) had undergone recombination. Therefore, we used three independent methods robust to the presence of recombination to define the population structure of this species: a phylogenetic tree based on a set of conserved protein sequences, in silico chromosome painting, and network analysis. All three methods were in broad agreement and supported the existence of three distinct clades within the species E. rhusiopathiae. Although we found some evidence of geographic and host clustering, each clade included isolates from diverse host species and from multiple continents. CONCLUSIONS: Using whole genome sequence data, we confirm recent suggestions that E. rhusiopathiae is a weakly clonal species that has been extensively shaped by homologous recombination. Despite frequent recombination, we can reliably identify three distinct clades that do not clearly segregate by host species or geographic origin. Our results provide an essential baseline for future molecular, ecological, and evolutionary epidemiological studies of E. rhusiopathiae and facilitate comparisons with other multihost recombinogenic bacteria.",,"Forde, T.;Biek, R.;Zadoks, R.;Workentine, M.

610,Genetic diversity among 2009 pandemic influenza viruses isolated from a chain of transmission,"BACKGROUND: Influenza viruses such as influenza A(H1N1) virus of swine origin (A(H1N1)pdm09) generate genetic diversity due to the high error rate of their RNA polymerase, often resulting in populations of mixed genotype (intrahost variants) within a single infection. This variation helps influenza respond rapidly to selection pressures, such as those imposed by the host's immune response and antiviral therapy. We have applied deep sequencing to characterize the intra-host variation of influenza in a chain of transmission consisting of three cases due to oseltamivir-susceptible viruses and one derived case resistant to oseltamivir. METHODS: Following detection of A(H1N1)pdm09 infections, we sequenced the entire NA gene from two of the oseltamivir-susceptible virus-infected cases and the eight gene segments from the viruses causing the remaining two cases. RESULTS: No evidence of the resistance-causing mutation (resulting in the H275Y NA substitution) was observed in oseltamivir-susceptible cases. Furthermore, deep sequencing revealed a subpopulation of viruses sensitive to oseltamivir in the event that they carried resistant viruses. We detected higher levels of intrahost variation in cases carrying oseltamivir-resistant viruses than in those infected with oseltamivir-susceptible viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Oseltamivir resistance was only detected after oseltamivir prophylaxis, suggesting that the mutation was selected for as a result of antiviral intervention. The persistent population of oseltamivir-susceptible virus in the case of resistant virus carriers suggests either that a small proportion survive treatment or that oseltamivir-susceptible virus rapidly re-establishes itself in the post-bottleneck virus population. Furthermore, the increased intra-host variation in the oseltamivir-resistant case is consistent with the hypothesis that the population diversity of an RNA virus can increase rapidly after a population bottleneck.",,"Fordyce, S.

611,Detection of hepatitis E virus in samples of animal origin collected in Hungary,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an enterically transmitted human pathogen. HEV infections are primarily associated with acute, self-limited icteric hepatitis, with an average mortality rate of 1%. Animal reservoirs are considered to play an important role in maintaining the virus and spreading HEV to humans. HEV-induced seroconversion has been described in several species, however, no clinical hepatitis has been observed in animals to date. Animal HEV strains are genetically closely related to human HEV isolates, supporting views of zoonotic transmission of the virus. In this extensive study, the occurrence of HEV in samples from Hungarian wild and domestic animals was investigated. HEV RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in wild boar, roe deer and deer liver samples. Investigations of samples from domestic pigs detected HEV in 39% of Hungarian pig farms investigated. Simultaneous investigation revealed no definitive difference between liver and fecal samples from domestic pigs in the frequency of HEV positivity. The highest incidence (36%) of HEV infection was found among pigs 11 to 16 weeks of age. Domestic cattle and rodent samples collected from pig farms, forests, and grasslands were negative for HEV RNA. Phylogenetic analysis of amplified partial sequences within the ORF1 and ORF2 regions of selected strains revealed that the detected viruses belong to three subgroups of the third HEV genogroup, and are closely related to human and porcine HEV strains detected in different countries. Investigations revealed a widespread distribution of HEVs in Hungarian wild ungulates and domesticated pig populations, with considerable genetic diversity between strains. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.",,"ForgÃ¡ch, P.;Nowotny, N.;ErdÃ©lyi, K.;Boncz, A.;Zentai, J.;Szucs, G.;Reuter, G.;Bakonyi, T.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.11.004,0
612,A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for differentiation of Massachusetts vaccine and Brazilian field genotypes of avian infectious bronchitis virus,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus is classified into serotypes or genotypes (or both) in different poultry-producing countries of the world. In Brazil, the Massachusetts (Mass) type, used as a live vaccine, and local Brazilian field variants (genotypes; BR) predominate in commercial poultry flocks. This study describes the development and validation of two real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) for the specific detection of Mass and BR genotypes in allantoic fluids and clinical samples. Genotype-specific primers, combined with a generic probe targeting the S1 gene, resulted in specific Mass RT-qPCR and BR RT-qPCR assays. The analytical sensitivity and linearity of these assays were determined in comparison with a generic IBV real-time RT-PCR based on the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR RT-qPCR). Mass RT-qPCR detected five Mass field isolates, three vaccine samples, and one coinfected sample (BR and Mass), while BR RT-qPCR detected 16 BR field isolates. Both assays were linear (R(2) > 0.98), reproducible, and as sensitive as classical 5'UTR RT-qPCR used to detect IBV. In the analysis of 141 IBV clinical samples, 8 were positive for Mass RT-qPCR, 76 for BR RT-qPCR, and 2 for both assays. In the remaining 55 samples, 25 were positive for 5'UTR RT-qPCR only and 30 were negative for all three assays. In conclusion, both assays were able to detect the Mass and BR genotypes, allowing rapid and easy molecular typing of IBV from allantoic fluids and clinical samples.",,"Fraga, A.

613,Discovery of parvovirus-related sequences in an unexpectedly wide range of animals,"Our knowledge of the genetic diversity and host ranges of viruses is fragmentary. This is particularly true for the Parvoviridae family. Studies of the genetic diversity of single-stranded DNA viruses within this family have largely focused on species that infect arthropods and vertebrates that cause disease in humans and our domestic animals: an approach that has biased our perception of parvovirus diversity. . While metagenomic approaches could help rectify this bias, transcriptomic studies could as well. Vast amounts of transcriptomic data are available for a wide variety of animal species and as long as these data were inadvertently collected from virus-infected individuals, they could contain detectable viral transcripts. Therefore, we performed a systematic search for parvovirus-related sequences (PRS) in publicly available protein, genome, and transcript databases and eleven new transcriptome datasets. This revealed 463 PRS in the transcript databases from 118 animals. At least 41 of these PRSs are likely to be integrated into animal genomes, as they were also found in genomic sequence databases. In addition to illuminating the ubiquity of parvoviruses, the number of parvovirus sequences discovered in public databases revealed numerous previously unknown parvovirus-host combinations; particularly in invertebrates. Our findings suggest that the host ranges of existing parvoviruses could span the entire animal kingdom.",,"FranÃ§ois, S.;Filloux, D.;Roumagnac, P.;Bigot, D.;Gayral, P.;Martin, D.

614,Classification of cowpox viruses into several distinct clades and identification of a new lineage,"The bovine pox virus (CPXV) was considered as a uniform species within the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV). The above phylogenetic analysis indicated that CPXV is polyphyletic and that isolates can be grouped into different clades, with two of these clades showing genetic similarities to variola (VARV) or vaccinia (VACV) viruses. Additional analyzes were initiated to assess both the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of circulating CPXVs. Here we report the complete sequences of 20 CPXV strains isolated from different animal species and humans in Germany. A phylogenetic analysis of a total of 83 complete OPV genomes confirmed the polyphyletic character of the CPXV species and suggested at least four different clades. The German isolates in this study mainly grouped into two CPXV-like clades, and VARV- and VACV-like strains were not observed. A single strain, isolated from a marmoset, clustered distantly from all other CPXVs and could represent a new and unique evolutionary lineage. The classification of CPXV strains into clades roughly followed their geographic origin, with the highest clade diversity observed so far in Germany. Furthermore, we found evidence of recombination between OPV clades without significant disruption of the observed clustering. In conclusion, this analysis markedly expands the number of available complete CPXV sequences and confirms the co-circulation of several CPXV clades in Germany, and provides the first data on a new evolutionary lineage of CPXV.",,"Franke, A.;Pfaff, F.;Jenckel, M.;Hoffmann, B.;HÃ¶per, D.;Antwerpen, M.;Meyer, H.;Beer, M.;Hoffmann, D.",2017.0,,10.3390/v9060142,0
615,Exploratory metagenomic analyzes of periweaning pigs affected by growth failure syndrome,"Modern pig farming is characterized by the appearance of several syndromes whose etiology is unclear or multifactorial in origin, including periweaning growth retardation syndrome (PFTS). In fact, its specific etiology remains elusive, although various causes have been investigated over time. The present study aimed to investigate the potential role of viral agents in healthy and PFTS-affected animals by evaluating the virome composition of different organs using a metagenomics approach. This analysis allowed to demonstrate an increased abundance of porcine parvovirus 6 (PPV6) in healthy subjects, while ungulate bocaparvovirus 2 (BoPV2), ungulate protoparvovirus 1 (PPV) and porcine circovirus 3 (PCV-3) were increased in pigs with PFTS. No differential abundance of RNA virus was found between PFTS-affected and control pigs. It should be noted that this is the first molecular characterization of PPV6 and BoPV2 in Spain and one of the few worldwide, supporting their apparent widespread circulation. Interestingly, PCV-3 has recently been identified in various clinicopathological conditions as well as in healthy pigs, while the pathogenic potential of BoPV2 is unknown. Although the results obtained should be taken as preliminary, they open the door to more studies on the potential role of these viruses or their combination as predisposing factors for the appearance of PFTS.",,"Franzo, G.;Kekarainen, T.;Llorens, A.;Correa-Fiz, F.;SegalÃ©s, J.",2019.0,,10.1136/vr.105125,0
616,Subpopulations in aMPV vaccines are unlikely to be the sole cause of reversion to virulence,"Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) infects the respiratory and reproductive tracts of domestic poultry, often with secondary infections, causing serious economic loss in most parts of the world. Although, in general, the disease is effectively controlled by live vaccines, reversion to virulence of these vaccines has been demonstrated on several occasions. Consensus sequence mutations involved in the process have been identified in more than one case. In a previous MPVa subtype A vaccine candidate study, small subpopulations were implicated. In the current study, the presence of subpopulations in a subtype B vaccine was investigated by deep sequencing. Of the 19 positions at which the consensus sequences of the vaccine (strain VCO3/50) and the parent (strain VCO3/60616) differed, the subpopulations were found to have a matching parent sequence at 4 positions. However, none of these mutations occurred in a virulent revertant of that vaccine, showing that the majority of the parent virus population had not survived the attenuation process and was therefore obviously not involved in any return to the virulence. However, within the vaccine, a single nucleotide variation was found that matched the consensus sequence of a derived revertant virulent virus, thus this and other undetected potentially virulent subpopulations may be involved in reversion. Much deeper sequencing of the parent, vaccine, and reverter can clarify whether problematic virulent subpopulations exist, and thus whether they need to be routinely removed during aMPV vaccine preparation prior to registration and release.",,"Franzo, G.;Naylor, C.

In vertebrates, the LEP gene symbol is reserved for leptin, the key regulator of energy balance in mammals. Results: A comprehensive search for this gene was initiated in the genome data that was submitted to public databases along with the duck genome manuscript, and this search was extended to all avian genomes in the Duck genome sequencing database. genome-wide shotgun, we were able to report the first identification of coding sequences capable of encoding the entire precursor protein leptin in wild birds. Genetic structure, synteny, and sequence similarity (up to 54% identity and 68% similarity) to the reptilian leptin evident in falcons (Falco peregrinus and cherrug), chickadees (Pseudopodoces humilis), finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and pigeons (Columba livia) that the bird's leptin was a true ortholog of its mammalian form. However, in the duck, as in other domestic birds, the LEP gene was not identifiable. Conclusion: The lack of the LEP gene in birds suggests that birds that have lost it are particularly suitable for domestication. The identification of an intact avian gene for leptin in wild birds could partly explain the evolutionary conservation of its receptor in leptin-negative birds. © 2014 Friedman-Einat and Seroussi; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Friedman-Einat, M.;Seroussi, E.",2014.0,,10.1186/1471-2164-15-551,0
619,Crystal structure of swine vesicular disease virus and implications for host adaptation,"Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) is an Enterovirus of the Picornaviridae family that causes symptoms indistinguishable from those of foot-and-mouth disease virus. Phylogenetic studies suggest that it is a recently evolved genetic sublineage of the important human pathogen coxsackievirus B5 (CBV5), and consistent with this, it has been shown to use the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) for cell entry. The 3,0-Ã… crystal structure of strain UK/27/72 SVDV (highly virulent) reveals the expected similarity in core structure with that of other picornaviruses, showing the greatest similarity to the closest available structure to CBV5, the of coxsackievirus B3 (CBV3). Features that help cement and harden protein subunits are widespread in this virus, perhaps explaining its extreme tolerance to environmental factors. Using the large number of available capsid sequences for both SVDV and CBV5, we have mapped the amino acid substitutions that may have occurred during putative adaptation of SVDV to a new host into the SVDV structure and a model of the SVDV/CAR complex. generated. by reference to the complex visualized by cryoelectron microscopy of CBV3 and CAR. The changes are divided into three groups as follows: one lines the quintuple pore, a second maps the CAR binding site, and partially overlaps the site for decay accelerating factor (DAF) to bind to echovirus 7 (ECHO7 ), and the third is located near the quintuple axis, where the low-density lipoprotein receptor binds to the minor group of rhinoviruses. Later changes in SVDV (post 1971) fall into the first two groups and may, by optimizing recognition of a pig CAR and/or DAF homologue, have improved adaptation of the virus to pigs.",,"Fry, E.

620,Molecular detection and typing of duck hepatitis A virus directly from clinical samples,"To develop a new approach for the detection and typing of duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV), a pair of non-degenerate primers was designed to amplify a genomic region of 250 bp in UTR 5. 3 reference strains and 6 isolates derived from duck embryos from various regions of China, involving 2 serotypes, were successfully amplified with the primer set. By determining the nucleotide sequence of the amplicon, a molecular typing method was developed. When the isolated sequences were compared to the DHAV 5â€²UTR sequences available in public databases, the nucleotide identity was ‰¥94% with the homologous serotype and ‰¤73% with the heterologous serotypes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a monophyletic clustering of 5-UTR sequences from a homologous serotype, confirming the new classification of DHAV (serotype 1 and the two new serotypes recently described in Taiwan and South Korea, respectively) into three genotypes (A, B and C) defined by the capsid coding region. Analysis of the results showed that the primer pair should aid in the detection of DHAV, and that the amplicon sequence contains type-specific information and can be used for rapid and efficient molecular typing. Molecular methods demonstrated their utility through the detection and typing of DHAV directly from 28 liver samples collected from ducklings killed during viral hepatitis outbreaks in ducks in different regions of China between 2001 and 2007. The results confirmed the presence of DHAV in all 28 samples. and showed that genotypes A (13/28) and C (15/28) of DHAV circulate simultaneously in China. © 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Fu, Y.;Pan, M.;Wang, X.;Xu, Y.;Yang, H.;Zhang, D.",2008.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.03.011,0
621,Comparative transcriptome analyzes indicate increased cellular protection against FMDV in PK15 cells pretreated with IFN-γ,"Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) can induce a host antiviral response to foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the mechanism of FMDV IFN-γ infection in host cells, high-throughput RNA sequencing was analyzed to detect systemic changes in gene expression profiles in FMDV-infected PK15 cells. FMD with or without pretreatment with IFN-γ. More than 25 million reads, spanning between 1.2 and 1.5 Gb, were analyzed from each panel of experiments. FMD virus challenge altered the transcription of genes involved in positive and negative regulation of cell death or apoptosis; however, the expected immune suppression response was not obvious. IFN-γ pretreatment combined with FMDV infection normalized increased apoptosis. In addition, transcription factors required for IFN-γ function, STAT1 and IRF1, were upregulated by IFN-γ pretreatment and stimulated downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These induced ISGs are primarily responsible for antigen processing, antigen presentation, or antiviral defense. Interestingly, a synergistic effect on some ISGs, including OAS1, OAS2, MX1, MX2, RIG-I, and IFIT1, was observed in combination treatment compared to IFN-γ treatment alone. Suggested effects identified by RNA sequencing were consistent with changes in cell morphology and confirmed by related protein markers. This is the first report to explore transcriptome alterations introduced by FMDV infection with or without IFN-γ pretreatment.

Control programs often include vaccination with a modified live viral vaccine (MLV). BoHV-1 strains are occasionally isolated from diseased animals or fetuses after vaccination. There are currently no markers to differentiate MLV strains from BoHV-1 field strains. In this study, several BoHV-1 strains were sequenced using whole genome sequencing technologies and the data analyzed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Strains sequenced included the BoHV-1 Cooper reference strain (GenBank Accession JX898220), eight commercial MLV vaccine strains, and 14 field strains from cases submitted for diagnosis. Based on SNP analyses, viruses could be classified into groups that have similar SNP patterns. The eight MLV strains could be differentiated from each other, although some were closely related to each other. Several field strains isolated from animals with a history of previous vaccination had SNP patterns similar to specific MLV viruses, while other field isolates were very different from all vaccine strains. The results indicate that some BoHV-1 isolates from clinically ill cattle/fetuses may be associated with a previous history of MLV vaccination, but more information on the rate of change of the BoHV-1 genome sequence is needed before it can be established. irrefutable associations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Fulton, R.

Antigenic drift is driven by an accumulation of point mutations in HA. And, the receptor binding specificity of HA is responsible for the host range restriction of the virus. In April 2009, large outbreaks of novel H1N1 influenza were reported in the human population in North America. The pandemic H1N1 virus originated from the swine flu virus. The evolutionary process of the pandemic virus after its introduction into the human population remains to be clarified. We performed phylogenetic analyzes by constructing a phylogenetic tree and calculating site-by-site selective pressures on the HA gene. The phylogenetic tree showed that the pandemic viruses were not clearly grouped by geographic location or time of isolation in the phylogenetic tree. The virus has been circulating widely throughout the world with multiple introductions in most geographic areas. We found 3 positively selected sites in the HA gene for the H1N1 pandemic virus.

627,Unexpected dynamics of transmission between farms during an epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza,"UNLABELED: Next-generation sequencing technology is now being increasingly applied to study virus population dynamics within and between hosts. However, information on the evolution and transmission of the avian influenza virus during a natural epidemic is still limited. Here, we use deep sequencing data obtained from clinical samples collected from five industrial farms and one backyard farm infected during the 2013 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N7 epidemic in Italy to unravel (i) the diversity of the virus population. epidemic, (ii) the evolution of the pathogenicity of the virus, and (iii) the routes of viral transmission between different farms and sheds. We show a high level of genetic diversity of HPAI H7N7 viruses within a single farm as a consequence of separate bottlenecks and founder effects. In particular, we identified cocirculation in the index case of two viral strains showing a different insertion at the hemagglutinin cleavage site, as well as nine nucleotide differences at the consensus level and 92 minor variants. To assess inter-farm transmission, we combined epidemiological and genetic data and identified the index case as the main source of the virus, suggesting spread of different viral haplotypes from the index farm to other industrial farms, probably at different times. Our results revealed inter-farm transmission dynamics that epidemiological data alone could not disentangle and showed that delayed detection of the disease and stamping-out was the main cause of the emergence and spread of the HPAI strain. SIGNIFICANCE: The evolutionary dynamics within and between hosts of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain during a natural epidemic is currently poorly understood. Here, we perform for the first time an in-depth sequence analysis of all samples collected during an HPAI epidemic and demonstrate the importance of complementing outbreak investigations with genetic data to reconstruct transmission dynamics of viruses and assess the relationship within and between -Genetic diversity of the viral population. We show that the evolutionary transition from the low pathogenicity form to the high pathogenicity form occurred within the first infected flock, where we identified haplotypes with hemagglutinin cleavage sites of different lengths.

In order to classify the identified virus strain, real-time PCR must often be supported by time-consuming capillary electrophoresis sequencing analysis. Here we provide a protocol for the rapid and reliable identification of 5 closely related herpesviruses using the PyroMark Q24 sequencing system. PyroMark performs DNA sequencing analysis using pyrosequencing, a technology based on the detection of pyrophosphate released during DNA elongation [1]. PyroMark is designed to detect changes at specific variable positions in DNA. It can efficiently detect single nucleotide differences in sequences [2]. In this article we describe a protocol to pyrosequencing a small polymorphic segment of the US8 gene. Based on the identified nucleotide sequence differences, we could easily classify herpesviruses as bovine herpesvirus 1.1, bovine herpesvirus 1.2, bovine herpesvirus 5, buffalo herpesvirus 1, or caprine herpesvirus. The protocol setup offers several advantages over commonly used techniques: it requires less than a day's work to perform; offers the possibility of analyzing, at reasonable costs, up to 24 samples at the same time; and allows highly reliable and specific detection of highly genetically correlated organisms such as the herpesviruses mentioned above.

Phenotypic characteristics of the six complementation groups,"Fifty temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of the rhabdovirus Chandipura virus have been classified into six complementation groups designated ChI to ChVI. The ChI pool contains 44 mutants, the ChII pool contains 2 mutants, and the remaining pools have 1 mutant each. Mutants in the ChI, ChIII, ChIV, and ChVI groups had negative RNA phenotypes in experiments that measured amplification of RNA synthesis at limiting temperature. The two ChII group mutants had RNA-positive phenotypes and the virions were thermolabile. The ChV group ts Ch851 mutant was also positive for RNA, and the M polypeptide of this mutant appeared to be unstable in cells incubated at the restrictive temperature. It is likely, therefore, that the ChII and ChV complementation groups represent the genes encoding the two viral virion envelope proteins. A precise assignment cannot be made in the case of the four RNA negative groups, since all the mutants examined showed some polymerase activity in vitro at limiting temperature. An attempt to obtain polymerase mutants by screening for rifampicin sensitivity was unsuccessful.

631,Unbiased High Throughput Sequencing Analysis of Viral Diversity in Fetal Bovine Serum and Trypsin Used in Cell Culture,"Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and trypsin are reagents used in cell culture and have been a source of viral contamination of pharmaceuticals. We performed high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of two sets of commercial FBS lots and three commercial trypsin lots. Taxonomies were assigned by comparing sequences of contigs and singletons to NCBI's comprehensive nucleic acid and protein databases. The same major viral species were evident between lots of a given reagent, but the ratio of viral reads to total reads varied markedly between samples (0.002% to 22.7%). In FBS, the sequences found were mainly bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) 1 to 3 and bovine parvovirus 3 (BPV3). FBS-derived BVDV sequences showed only minor discrepancies with primers generally used for BVDV detection. The viral sequences in the trypsin were mainly from porcine circovirus type 2. Other known viral sequences were evidenced at lower read counts and potential new viral species (bovine parvovirus and bovine pegivirus). The load of some known and new viruses detected by HTS could be quantified by qPCR. HTS results provide a framework to assess the appropriateness of control measures, including PCR design, bioassays, and inactivation procedures. © 2014 The International Alliance for Biological Standardization.",,"Gagnieur, L.;Cheval, J.;Gratigny, M.;HÃ©bert, C.;Muth, E.;Dumarest, M.;Eloit, M.",2014.0,,10.1016/j.biologicals.2014.02.002,0
632,Genetic characterization and evolutionary analysis of Newcastle disease virus isolated from domestic duck in South Korea,"Domestic ducks are considered a potential reservoir for Newcastle disease virus. In the study, a Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolated from a domestic duck during surveillance in South Korea was characterized. The complete genome of the NDV isolate was sequenced and the phylogenetic relationship with the reference strains was studied. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the genotype I clustered strain of class II ND viruses has high phylogenetic similarity with NDV strains isolated from waterfowl in China, but was distant from viruses isolated from chickens and strains of vaccines used in South Korea. The pathogenicity experiment in chickens revealed that it was a lentegenic virus. The deduced amino acid sequence of the fusion protein (F) cleavage site confirmed that the isolate contained the avirulent 112GKQGRL117 motif at the cleavage site and caused no apparent disease in chickens and ducks. Using fusion gene-based phylogeographic analyses, we estimate the origin of an ancestral virus from the isolate and its sister strain located in China around 1998. It highlights the need for continued surveillance to improve the current understanding of the molecular epidemiology and evolution of diseases. pathogenic strains. .",,"Gaikwad, S.;Kim, J. Y.;Lee, H.

None of the sera collected from pigs with clinical symptoms were positive in the serological tests prescribed by the OIE. However, seven hemadsorbent viruses were isolated in macrophage culture and genotyped by partial full-length p72 and p54 gene sequencing. Four of these viruses were isolated directly from serum samples. All viruses were classified within the domestic swine cycle-associated p72 and p54 genotype IX, which also includes the viruses responsible for the African swine fever outbreaks in Kenya in 2006 and 2007 and in Uganda in 2003. amino acid repeat regions within the central variable region (CVR) of the B602L gene. Sequences from isolates from Uganda exhibited 100% identity to viruses isolated from outbreaks in Kenya in 2007. The identity was higher than that of viruses obtained from a previous outbreak in Kenya in 2006.

636,Genetic information of DNAIII mycobacteriophages and their antituberculous potential,"Objective: To understand the genetic information of the mycobacteriophage DNAIII and to explore its antituberculous potential. Methods: Mycobacteriophage DNAIII DNA was isolated and purified using the lambda DNA extraction protocol. Shotgun sequences were assembled with Phred and PhraD and edited with Consed, then gaps were filled by sequencing PCR fragments. General features of the genome were analyzed using EditSeq software from the DNAStar software package. The genome was scanned for open reading frames using Glimmer 3.0. The genetic information of the DNAIII mycobacteriophage genome was further explored by collinearity analysis and phylogenetic tree construction. The ability of DNAIII to lyse M. tuberculosis was investigated in vitro and the effects of temperature, alcohol, and pH values on DNAIII survival were determined. Results: The DNAIII genome was 39,520 bp in size, and was linear double-stranded DNA, with a G+C content of 66.83%. DNAIII contained 60 predicted protein-coding genes and did not encode any tRNAs. There was no tandem repeat sequence in the DNAIII genome. DNAIII gene 32 encoded integrase, and there was also no gene encoding a repressor. DNAIII was very similar and colinear at the nucleotide acid level to Angel and BP. At three different time points (1 day, 2 days, and 3 days), the number of M. tuberculosis in the DNAIII group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). DNAIII was unstable at temperature, alcohol and pH values. Conclusion: DNAIII, which belongs to group G, is a mycobacteriophage capable of lysing M.tuberculosis.",,"Gan, Y. L.;Liu, P.;Wu, T.

637,Newcastle disease virus: current status and our understanding Review,"Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the highly pathogenic viral diseases of avian species. Newcastle disease is economically significant due to the enormous mortality and morbidity associated with it. The disease is endemic in many third world countries where agriculture is the main source of national income. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae and is a well-characterized member of the avian paramyxovirus serotypes. In recent years, NDV has attracted virologists not only for its pathogenic potential, but also for its oncolytic activity and its use as a vaccine vector for both humans and animals. The NDV-based recombinant vaccine offers a pertinent option for the construction of live attenuated vaccines due to its modular nature of transcription, minimal frequency of recombination, and lack of DNA phase during replication. Our current understanding about the biology of NDV is rapidly expanding due to the availability of modern molecular biology tools and high-throughput whole genome sequencing.",,"Ganar, K.;Das, M.;Sinha, S.;Kumar, S.",2014.0,2012-05-01 00:00:00,,0

Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) is a type of retrovirus that can infect multiple species of birds, causing exhaustion syndrome, immunosuppression, and oncogenesis. In this study, we analyzed AS in REV-infected chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) that were inoculated with the second generation of REVs (group VB) and compared to normal CEFs (group C) by high-throughput RNA sequencing technology. . A total of 6,939 alternatively spliced genes were detected, among them, skipped exon (SE) was the most common pattern. Furthermore, 5,607 differentially expressed AS genes were detected; Compared to group C, group VB has 2825 genes significantly upregulated and 2782 genes significantly downregulated. These 5,607 differentially expressed AS genes are involved in many important biological processes. Many of them are involved in apoptosis and tumorigenesis. We also demonstrate, using agarose gel electrophoresis, that the AS events predicted by our study are authentic and AS is closely related to apoptosis and tumorigenesis in REV-infected CEFs. Our study provides the best analysis to date of the potential link between AS and CEF in response to REV infection.

640,"Classification of a new member of the TBE flavivirus subgroup by its immunological, pathogenetic and molecular characteristics: Identification of specific pentapeptides of the subgroup","The antigenic, pathogenic, and molecular characteristics of Turkish ovine encephalitis (TSE) virus, strain TTE80, were compared with other members of the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus complex. Monoclonal antibodies with defined specificity for the flavivirus envelope glycoprotein distinguished TSE virus from louping ill (LI), western or far TBE, Langat, and Powassan viruses in indirect immunofluorescence, hemagglutination inhibition, and neutralization tests. On the other hand, TSE virus, which produces LI-like disease in sheep, resembled LI virus in mouse neurovirulence tests. Molecular homology data of all structural genes of TSE virus compared to other tick-borne flaviviruses demonstrated that TSE virus is a distinct member of the TBE virus subgroup. The data are consistent with the conclusion that the TSE virus has evolved by a separate evolutionary pathway compared to the close antigenic relatives, the Western European and Far Eastern TBE viruses and the LI virus. By aligning amino acids encoded in the viral envelope glycoprotein of mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses, we have also identified subgroup-specific pentapeptide motifs for tick-borne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, and the dengue virus subgroup of the genus Flavivirus.

We present here information on the clinical characteristics of two patients from the same family infected with this virus, the genomic sequences of the harbored viruses and the sensitivity to antiviral drugs. Methods: Clinical and epidemiological data of two patients from the same family were collected and analyzed. Sequencing of the viruses isolated from these two patients and from an epidemiologically related chicken was performed, and the sequences of the eight genetic segments of the viruses were analyzed phylogenetically. Virus sensitivity to antiviral drug treatment was determined by neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility testing. Results: The two patients in a family group shared the same symptoms but had different outcomes and had a strong epidemiological link. Three strains were isolated, two from these two patients and one from the chicken. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic tree analyzes showed that the two viruses were nearly identical. We observed the presence of the PB2 E627K amino acid substitution that was not present in the first wave isolates, as well as two new mutations in the NA gene and six in the PB2 gene. Drug susceptibility testing showed that the new isolates were resistant to oseltamivir but sensitive to peramivir.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with the differential expression of miRNAs during influenza A virus infection, we performed a global expression profile of miRNAs and mRNAs in A549 cells infected with seasonal influenza A virus of human origin H3N2. (Human_Br07), influenza A virus of swine origin H1N1 (SW_3861) or influenza A virus of avian origin H3N2 (AVI_9990). miRNA and mRNA expression profiles were obtained by microarray analysis and high-throughput sequencing, respectively. Integrated analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed using bioinformatics tools, and miRNA and mRNA expression was validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We identified 20 miRNAs (6 upregulated and 14 downregulated) and 1286 mRNAs (935 upregulated and 351 downregulated) that show the same differential expression trends in three groups of infected cells compared to a non-infected control. infected. An integrated analysis of these expression profiles identified 79 miRNA-mRNA pairs associated with the influenza A reference pathway, and 107 miRNA-mRNA interactions correlated with virus defense.

644,"Biological heterogeneity, including systemic replication in mice, of influenza A H5N1 virus isolates from humans in Hong Kong","An avian influenza A H5N1 virus was transmitted to humans in Hong Kong in 1997. Although the virus causes systemic infection and is highly lethal in chickens due to susceptibility of hemagglutinin to furin and PC6 proteases, it is not known whether it also causes systemic infection. . infection in humans. The clinical outcomes of infection in Hong Kong residents varied widely, from mild respiratory illness to multi-organ failure leading to death. Therefore, to understand the pathogenesis of influenza due to these H5N1 isolates, we investigated their virulence in mice. The results identified two distinct groups of viruses: group 1, for which the lethal dose for 50% of mice (MLD50) was between 0.3 and 11 PFU, and group 2, for which the MLD50 was higher at 103 PFU. One day after intranasal inoculation of mice with 100 PFU of group 1 virus, the virus titer in the lungs was 107 PFU/g or 3 logs higher than that of group 2 viruses. had replicated to high titers (>106 PFU/g) in the lungs on day 3 and maintained these titers through day 6. More importantly, only group 1 viruses caused systemic infection, replicating in non-respiratory organs, including the brain. . Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated replication of a group 1 virus in brain neurons and glial cells and in cardiac myofibers. Phylogenetic analysis of all viral genes showed that both groups of Hong Kong H5N1 viruses had formed a distinct lineage from those of other viruses and that no genetic rearrangement had occurred between human H5N1 and H1 or H3 viruses. Since mice and humans harbor the proteases furin and PC6, we suggest that the virulence mechanism responsible for the lethality of influenza viruses in birds also operates in mammalian hosts. The failure of some H5N1 viruses to produce systemic infection in our model indicates that multiple factors, yet to be identified, contribute to the severity of H5N1 infection in mammals. Furthermore, the ability of these viruses to produce systemic infection in mice and the clear differences in pathogenicity between the isolates studied here indicate that this system provides a useful model for studying the pathogenesis of avian influenza virus infection in mammals.",,"Gao, P.;Watanabe, S.;Ito, T.;Goto, H.;Wells, K.;McGregor, M.;James Cooley, A.;Kawaoka, Y.",1999.0,,,0

Cattle, a major reservoir for the pathogen, harbor E. coli O157:H7 in their gastrointestinal tract and shed variable concentrations of E. coli O157:H7 into the environment. Genetic characterization of E. coli O157 strains from cattle farms is of interest to the livestock industry, the feed business, and the public health community. The present study applied whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) and single nucleotide variant (SNV) to characterize 279 cattle barn E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated from a single feedlot located in the region Southwestern US. More than 4,000 SNVs were identified among the strains, and the resulting phylogenomic tree revealed three main groups. Using the Sakai strain genome as a reference, more than 2000 SNVs were annotated and a detailed SNV map was generated. The results clearly revealed highly polymorphic loci throughout the E. coli O157:H7 genome that aligned with prophage regions and highly variant genes involved in bacterial genetic information processing. WGS data was further profiled against a comprehensive virulence factor database (VFDB) for the identification of virulence genes. Of the total of 285 identified virulence genes, only 132 were present in all strains. There were six virulence genes unique to individual isolates. Our findings suggested that variations in the E. coli O157:H7 genome were primarily attributed to the dynamics of certain phages, and that the bacterial strains have variable virulence genetic profiles, despite originating from a single population of cattle, which which may explain differences in pathogenicity, host prevalence, and transmissibility by E. coli O157:H7.",,"Gao, X.;Yang, X.;Noll, L.;Shi, X.;Worley, J.;Allard, M.;Brown, E.;Nagaraja, T.

The other viruses, namely the simian strain S:USA:79:2, the Ohio State University swine strain P:USA:77:1, and the human strain WA, had already adapted to cell culture, although were cloned for this work. The serum neutralization test was used to classify viruses into serotype groups. Viruses exhibiting a 20-fold or greater difference in neutralization titer were separated into different serotype groups. In this study, four main groups of serotypes were found, and these groups were represented by bovine, human, porcine, and canine-ape strains. From cross-protection studies, these serotype groups were found to be significantly different. With the exception of the swine strain, none of the viruses used as vaccines protected gnotobiotic piglets from challenge with the virulent Ohio State University strain of swine rotavirus. In addition, the canine virus protected piglets from challenge with the simian virus. RNA electropherotyping confirmed that the canine and simian strains were different in eight RNA segments and eliminated the possibility that they were the same virus. From these findings, it was concluded that only viruses belonging to the same serotype group can confer cross-protection and therefore vaccines should be made with the serotypes to which the animal is likely to be exposed.",,"Gaul, A.

653,Genetic diversity of novel circular ssDNA viruses in bats in China,"Novel circular ssDNA genomes have recently been detected in animals and the environment using high-throughput sequencing and metagenomics approaches. In this study, five full-length circular ssDNA genomes were recovered from bat fecal samples by inverse PCR with sequences designed based on circovirus-related sequences obtained from Solexa sequencing data derived from a random amplification method. . These five sequences shared a genomic organization similar to the recently proposed circovirus or cyclovirus of the Circoviridae family. The newly obtained circovirus/cyclovirus-like genomes ranged from 1,741 to 21,77 bp, and each consisted of two major ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2, encoding putative replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins, respectively. The potential stem-loop region was predicted in all five genomes, and three of them had the conserved nonanucleotide motif typical of cycloviruses. A set of primers targeting the conserved Rep region was designed and used to detect the prevalence of circovirus/cyclovirus sequences in individual bats. Of the 199 samples tested, 47 (23.6%) were positive for the circovirus genome and two (1.0%) for the cyclovirus genome. In total, 48 partial Rep sequences plus the five complete genomes were obtained in this study. Detailed analysis indicated that these sequences are distantly related to known circovirus/cyclovirus genomes and may represent 22 new species belonging to the Circoviridae family.",,"Ge, X.

654,"Wild H1NX Avian Influenza Virus Outbreak in Anhui, China","Background: As natural hosts of avian influenza viruses (AIVs), aquatic and migratory birds provide a gene pool for interspecies and interspecies gene transfer, forming transient ""genomic constellations."" This work describes the phylogenetic dynamics of H1NX based on the complete molecular characterization of eight virus genes that were collected between 2014 and 2015 in Anhui province, China. Methods: Hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition tests were used to determine hemagglutination activity (HA) of HA subtypes. The complete genomes of the viruses were sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3500xl DNA analyzer. The sequences were genetically analyzed to study their genetic evolution using DNASTAR and MEGA 6. The pathogenic effects of the viruses were evaluated using infection models in mice. Results: Seven strains of the avian influenza virus subtype H1 were isolated. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a natural recombination of H1 influenza viruses between the Eurasian lineage and the North American lineage. Some genes had high sequence identity with A/bean goose/Korea/220/2011(H9N2), which is a typical case involving viral reassortment between Eurasian lineage and North American lineage. The results of the mouse infection experiments showed that the viruses could acquire the ability to multiply in the respiratory organs of the mice without adaptation. Conclusions: These findings suggest that ongoing surveillance of wild birds, particularly migratory birds, is important to provide early warning of potential H1 influenza epidemics and to understand the ecology of the virus.",,"Ge, Y.;Yao, Q.

655,Genetically diverse and low pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtypes co-circulate among poultry in Bangladesh,"Influenza virus surveillance, poultry outbreak investigations, and genome sequencing were evaluated to understand the ecology and evolution of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A viruses in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2013. We analyzed 506 specimens. avians collected from birds at live bird markets and backyard flocks. to identify influenza A viruses. Samples with positive virus isolation (n = 50) were subtyped and their entire coding genomes sequenced. The most frequently identified subtypes among LPAI isolates were H9N2, H11N3, H4N6, and H1N1. Less commonly detected subtypes included H1N3, H2N4, H3N2, H3N6, H3N8, H4N2, H5N2, H6N1, H6N7, and H7N9. Gene sequences were compared to publicly available sequences using phylogenetic inference approaches. Among the 14 subtypes identified, most of the viral gene segments were most closely related to poultry or wild bird viruses commonly found in Southeast Asia, Europe, and/or North Africa. LPAI subtypes were distributed across various geographical locations in Bangladesh, and surface and internal protein gene segments clustered phylogenetically with a diverse number of viral subtypes, suggesting extensive shuffling among these LPAI viruses. Viruses of the H9N2 subtype differed from other LPAI subtypes in that the genes of these viruses clustered consistently, indicating that this subtype is enzootic in Bangladesh. The H9N2 strains identified in Bangladesh were phylogenetically and antigenically related to H9N2 viruses of human origin previously detected in Bangladesh and represented a potential source of human infection. In contrast, circulating LPAI H5N2 and H7N9 viruses had no phylogenetic or antigenic relationship to previously identified H5 viruses in humans in Bangladesh and to H7N9 strains isolated from humans in China. In Bangladesh, domestic birds sold in live bird markets carried a wide range of LPAI virus subtypes and a great diversity of genotypes. These findings, combined with the seven-year sampling period, indicate continued circulation of these viruses in the country.",,"Gerloff, N. A.;Khan, S.

656,Microarray resources for genetic and genomic studies in chicken: a review,"The advent of microarray technologies revolutionized the nature and scope of genetic and genomic research in humans and other species by allowing massive parallel analysis of thousands of genomic sites. They have been used for various purposes, such as transcriptome analysis, CNV detection, SNP and CNV genotyping, DNA-protein interaction study, and genome methylation detection. Microarrays have also made invaluable contributions to research on chickens, which is an important model organism for studying embryology, immunology, oncology, virology, evolution, genetics, and genomics, and for other bird species as well. Despite its enormous contributions to life science research, the future of microarrays is now in question with the advent of massively parallel next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, which promise to overcome some of the limitations of existing technologies. microarray platforms. In this article we review the various microarray resources developed for chicken and their past and potential future applications. We also discuss the future of microarrays in the NGS era, particularly in the context of livestock genetics. We argue that although NGS promises some important advantages, in particular offering the opportunity to discover novel elements in the genome, microarrays will remain important tools for research and practice in the field of livestock genetics/genomics due to their affordability, high performance nature, mature established technologies and ease of application. Furthermore, with the advent of new microarray technologies such as capture arrays, NGS and microarrays are expected to complement each other in future life science research. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Gheyas, A.

657,Transformation of animal genomics by next-generation sequencing technologies: a decade of challenges and their impact on genetic architecture,"For more than a quarter of a century, sequencing technologies, from the Sanger method to next-generation high-throughput techniques, have provided exciting opportunities in the life sciences. The continued upward trajectory of sequencing technologies will enhance livestock research and accelerate the development of several new genomic and technological studies with farm animals. The use of high-throughput technologies in livestock research has increased interest in metagenomics, epigenetics, genome-wide association studies, and the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variations. Such studies are beginning to provide revolutionary insights into biological and evolutionary processes. Farm animals, such as cattle, pigs, and horses, have played a dual role as economically and agriculturally important animals, as well as models for biomedical research. The first part of this study explores the current state of sequencing methods, many of which are already used in animal genomics studies, and the second part summarizes the state of bovine, porcine, equine and chicken genome sequencing and illustrates his achievements over the past few years. few years. Finally, we describe several high-throughput sequencing approaches to improve detection of known, unknown, and emerging infectious agents, leading to better diagnosis of infectious diseases. Insights from viral metagenomics and the advancement of next generation sequencing will strongly support the development of targeted and efficient vaccines and provide strategies to control the transmission of infectious diseases between animal populations and/or between animals and humans.

658,Genetic Screening and Characterization of Emerging HoBi-Like Viruses in Archival Fetal Bovine Serum Batches,"Bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV) are members of the Pestivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family. Based on antigenic and nucleotide differences, BVDVs are classified into two recognized species, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. More recently, a new putative species of pestivirus, tentatively named ""HoBi-like"", has been associated with bovine viral diarrhea. HoBi-like viruses were first identified in fetal bovine serum (FBS) imported from Brazil. Subsequently, several HoBi-like viruses have been detected as contaminants in FBS or cell culture and in live ruminants. To further investigate potential pestivirus contamination in commercially available FBS lots, 26 FBS lots with various countries of origin were tested for the presence of bovine pestiviruses in this study. All 26 lots tested positive by RT-PCR for at least one bovine pestivirus species. HoBi-like viruses were detected in 15 batches. Analysis of the 5'UTR and Npro sequences of 15 newly identified HoBi-like viruses, combined with analysis of additional sequences from GenBank, identified 4 genetic clusters tentatively designated 3a-3d. The current study confirmed the presence of emerging HoBi-like viruses in labeled FBS products with different geographic origins.

Understanding the genomic characteristics and taxonomy of the virus is essential to sustain control and prophylactic programs. Given the various recent studies reporting a relatively high number of new strains, particularly from Asian countries, 482 genomic sequences have been evaluated in the present study using the palindromic nucleotide substitution method for genotyping.

The biological and physicochemical characteristics of the virus indicate that it is closely related to the measles, rinderpest, and canine distemper viruses.

The use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in outbreak analysis facilitates rapid and accurate identification of pathogen virulence factors and can be used to identify the route of disease transmission within a population and provide information on the likely source. Molecular tools such as WGS are being refined and advanced at a rapid rate to provide robust, higher resolution methods for identifying, comparing, and classifying pathogenic organisms. If these pathogen characterization methods are applied correctly, they will enable a better public health response, whether a disease outbreak was initiated by natural events or by accidental or deliberate human activity.

664,Massive depletion of bovine leukemia virus proviral clones located at transcriptionally active genomic sites during primary infection,"Deltaretroviruses such as human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and bovine leukemia virus (BLV) induce a persistent infection that is usually asymptomatic but can also lead to leukemia or lymphoma. These viruses replicate by infecting new lymphocytes (ie, the infectious cycle) or by clonal expansion of infected cells (the mitotic cycle). The relative importance of these two cycles in viral replication varies during infection. Most infected clones are created before the onset of an effective immune response. Subsequently, the main route of replication is the mitotic expansion of pre-existing infected clones. Due to the scarcity of available samples and for ethical reasons, only scant data on early HTLV-1 infection are available. Therefore, we address this question in a comparative BLV model. We used high-throughput sequencing to map and quantify provirus insertion sites to monitor the clonality of the BLV-infected cell population (ie, the number of distinct clones and the abundance of each clone). We found that BLV spread switches from cellular neoinfection to clonal proliferation in approximately 2 months from inoculation. Initially, proviral integration of BLV significantly favors the transcribed regions of the genome. Negative selection then eliminates 97% of clones detected at seroconversion and disfavors BLV-infected cells that carry a provirus located near a promoter or gene. However, among surviving proviruses, the abundance of clones is positively correlated with the proximity of the provirus to a transcribed region. Two opposing forces operate during primary infection and dictate the long-term fate of clonal composition: (1) initial integration within genes or promoters and (2) negative host selection that disfavors proviruses located adjacent to transcribed regions. The outcome of this initial response will contribute to the proviral load set point value, as clonal abundance will benefit from carrying a provirus in the transcribed regions. © 2013 Gillet et al.",,"Gillet, N.

665,Bovine leukemia virus small non-coding RNAs are functional elements that regulate replication and contribute to oncogenesis in vivo,"Retroviruses are not expected to encode miRNAs due to the potential problem of self-cleavage of their genomic RNAs. This assumption has recently been challenged by experiments showing that bovine leukemia virus (BLV) encodes miRNA from intragenomic Pol III promoters. BLV miRNAs are abundantly expressed in B cell tumors in the absence of significant levels of genomic and subgenomic viral RNA. Using deep RNA sequencing and functional reporter assays, we show that miRNAs mediate the expression of genes involved in cell signaling, cancer, and immunity. Furthermore, we show that BLV miRNAs are essential for inducing B-cell tumors in an experimental model and for promoting efficient viral replication in the natural host.",,"Gillet, N.

666,Sequence analysis of bovine herpesvirus type 5 (BHV-5) alpha trans inducer factor,"Bovine herpesvirus (BHV), a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, is classified into neurovirulent and non-neurovirulent subtypes on the basis of differential neuropathogenicities. Transcription of viral immediate early (IE) genes during alphaherpesvirus gene expression is mediated by a multicomponent immediate early complex (IEC) composed of viral tegument protein alpha transinducing factor (α-tif), a protein host cell (HCF) and a host octameric protein (Oct). In this article we present a sequence analysis of the α-tif of the encephalitic BHV subtype, bovine herpesvirus type 5 (BHV-5). Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) and BHV-5 α-tifs share 98% amino acid sequence homology. However, BHV-5 α-tif is 23 residues shorter at the amino terminus than BHV-1 α-tif. The amino acid alignment of the α-tifs of BHV-1 and BHV-5 with other alphaherpesviruses indicates areas of conserved motifs but also important differences located mainly at the amino and carboxyl termini.",,"Gillette, K.;Misra, V.;Bratanich, A.",2002.0,,10.1023/a:1014520616362,0
667,Neuropathotyping: a new system to classify Marek's disease virus,"statistical approach was used to establish a new classification system for Marek's disease virus (MDV) based on neurological responses. To develop the system, neurological response data from 15x7 chickens inoculated with 30 MDV serotype 1 strains were statistically analyzed using cluster analysis. The goal was to identify a statistical system that would verify whether three neurovirulence clusters correlated with the three pathotypes described above. The system was also validated on two additional specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken strains, SPAFAS and the SC (Hy-Vac) line. The proposed system is based on the analysis of three variables: 1) frequency of birds showing transient paralysis between 9 and 11 days post-inoculation (dpi), (2) mortality before 15 dpi, and (3) frequency of birds showing disease persistent neurological between 21 and 23 dpi. Using this system, an MDV can be classified into one of three groups, termed neuropathotypes A, B, and C, which roughly correspond to the virulent, highly virulent, and highly virulent plus pathotypes, respectively. However, the correlation between neuropathotype and pathotype was not absolute, and neuropathotyping is more of a complement to the current pathotyping system than a replacement for it. Our results showed that neuropathotyping studies can be performed on two types of commercial SPF chickens by using the same variables, although the system would first have to be standardized by using virus prototypes. Neuropathotypes can also be estimated with our statistical analysis with reasonable precision. Using this analysis, we established that MDV strains within the highly virulent pathotype can be subdivided into neuropathotypes B and C, thus establishing a previously unrecognized pathotypic classification. This finding illustrates how neuropathotyping can amplify important information not identified by conventional pathotyping.",,"Gimeno, I. M.;Witter, R. L.;Neumann, U.",2002.0,Oct-Dec,,0
668,Natural transmission and comparative analysis of small ruminant lentiviruses in Norwegian sheep and goat populations.,"Serologic surveys for small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infections have revealed seropositive sheep in several mixed herds, where sheep are kept together with seropositive goats. Here we have examined the genetic relationships in the LTR, pol and env surface unit (SU) and growth patterns in goat (GSM) and sheep (FOS) synovial membrane cell cultures of SRLV isolates obtained from mixed herds and of a single species. Phylogenetic analyzes of pol and env SU revealed that Norwegian SRLVs derived from goats and sheep in mixed herds are distributed in group C, while isolates obtained from unmixed sheep herds are grouped in group A, together with representatives of the subtype A1 similar to maedi-visna. . In this study, the direction of transmission of group C virus is proposed to be from goat to sheep. The replication efficiency in GSM and FOS cultures and the cytopathic phenotype induced by the SRLV isolates did not indicate any species-specific characteristics. No particular nucleotide sequences of the LTR-U3 or env SU region that could be related to the cytopathic phenotype were identified. This study shows that sheep in Norway harbor SRLVs belonging to phylogenetic groups A and C, and this provides further evidence that cross-species infection is a regular feature of SRLVs, which may represent an important source of viral persistence. © 2007 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Gjerset, B.;Jonassen, C.

669,Characterization of microRNAs encoded by the genome of bovine herpesvirus 1,"Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) is a ubiquitous and important pathogen of cattle worldwide. This study reports the identification of 10 microRNA (miRNA) genes, Bhv1-mir-B1-Bhv1-mir-B10, encoded by the BoHV-1 genome that were processed into 12 detectable mature miRNAs as determined by cell sequencing bioinformatic analyses. ultra high performance. of small RNA libraries and expression studies. We found that four of the miRNA genes were present as two copies in the BoHV-1 genome, resulting in a total of 14 miRNA-coding loci. Unique features of BoHV-1 miRNAs include evidence of bidirectional transcription and a close association of two miRNA genes with the origin of replication, including one miRNA that is encoded at the origin of replication. The Bhv1-mir-B5 miRNA gene encoded on the opposite DNA strand from the latency-associated transcript, potentially giving rise to antisense transcripts originating from this locus. The association of herpesvirus miRNAs with latency appears to be a common feature in alphaherpesviruses. Analyzes of the BoHV-5 genome for putative miRNA gene orthologs identified a high degree of evolutionary conservation for nine of the BoHV-1 miRNA genes.

670,Epidemiological and molecular analysis of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 in a German zoo: effective disease control with minimal culling,"Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N8, clade 2.3.4.4, were first reported in January 2014 in South Korea. These viruses spread rapidly to Europe and the North American continent during the fall of 2014 and caused five outbreaks in poultry farms in Germany up to February 2015. In addition, birds in a zoo in north-eastern Germany were affected. Only a few individual white storks (Ciconia ciconia) showed clinical symptoms and eventually died in the course of infection, although further in-depth diagnostic investigations showed that other birds kept in the same white stork enclosure were either acutely positive or had been subjected to infection. a Asymptomatic HPAIV H5N8 infection. The competent authority granted an exception to the sacrifice of the 500 remaining birds of the zoo. Restriction measures included grouping zoo birds into eight epidemiological units in which 60 birds from each unit repeatedly tested negative for H5N8. Epidemiological and phylogenetic investigations revealed that the most likely source of introduction was direct or indirect contact with infected wild birds, as white storks had access to a small pond frequented by wild mallards and other wild waterfowl over a period of 10 days in December 2014. Median network analysis showed that zoo bird viruses segregated into a distinct group from the 2.3.4.4 clade with closest links to H5N8 isolates obtained from mute swans (Cygnus olor) in Sweden in April 2015.

671,Swine influenza virus subtyping using a high-throughput real-time PCR platform,"Influenza A viruses (IAV) are important human and animal pathogens with a high impact on human and animal health. In Denmark, a passive surveillance program for IAV in pigs has been carried out since 2011, where detection tests and subsequent subtyping are carried out using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). A disadvantage of the current subtyping system is that multiple assays are needed to cover the wide range of circulating subtypes, making the system costly and time consuming. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to develop a high-throughput method that could improve swine influenza virus (swIAV) surveillance and reduce virus subtyping costs. Twelve swIAV-relevant hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene lineage-specific qPCR assays and six internal IAV gene-specific assays were developed and optimized for the BioMark high-throughput qPCR platform (Fluidigm). The qPCR assays were validated and optimized to run under the same reaction conditions using a 48.48 dynamic array (48.48DA). Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated by testing virus isolates and field samples with known subtypes. The results revealed a performance of swIAV 48.48DA similar to the conventional real-time assay, and in addition, the specificity of swIAV 48.48DA was very high and there was no cross-reactivity between assays.

672,"Potential for coinfection of a mosquito-specific flavivirus, nhumirim virus, to block transmission of West Nile virus in mosquitoes","Nhumirim virus (NHUV) is an insect-specific virus that is phylogenetically affiliated with dual-host mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Previous in vitro coinfection experiments demonstrated that prior or concurrent infection of Aedes albopictus C6/36 mosquito cells with NHUV resulted in a 10,000-fold reduction in West Nile virus (WNV) viral production. This interference between WNV and NHUV was observed here in an Ae. albopictus mosquito cell line, C7-10. A WNV 2K peptide mutant (V9M) capable of superinfecting with a pre-established WNV infection demonstrated a comparable level of NHUV interference as the parent WNV strain in C6/36 and C7-10 cells. Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex pipiens mosquitoes inoculated intrathoracicly with NHUV and WNV, or with WNV alone as a control, were allowed to extrinsically incubate virus for up to nine and 14 days, respectively, and WNV transmissibility and replication were determined. The proportion of Cx. quinquefasciatus capable of transmitting WNV was significantly lower for the WNV/NHUV group than the WNV control at seven and nine days post inoculation (dpi), while no difference was observed in Cx. pipiens inoculation group. At nine dpi, a 40% reduction in transmissibility was observed in mosquitoes in the double inoculation group compared to the WNV-only control.

673,Interaction between MDV and HVT affects viral miRNA expression,"It is well established that herpesviruses encode numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) and that these small virally encoded RNAs play multiple roles in infection. The present study was conducted to determine how co-infection of a pathogenic strain of MDV serotype one (MDV1) (MD5) and a vaccine strain (herpesvirus of turkeys [HVT]) alters viral miRNA expression in vivo. We first used deep small RNA sequencing to identify MDV1-encoded miRNAs that are expressed in tumorigenic spleens of MDV1-infected birds. The expression patterns of these miRNAs were subsequently assessed at an early time point (7 days post infection [dpi]) and a late time point (42 dpi) in birds with and without HVT vaccination using real-time PCR. (RT-PCR). Furthermore, the effect of MDV1 coinfection on HVT-encoded miRNAs was determined by RT-PCR. A diverse population of miRNAs was expressed in MDV-induced tumorigenic spleens at 42 dpi, with 18 of the 26 known mature miRNAs represented. Of these, both mdv1-miR-M4-5p and mdv1-miR-M2-3p were the most highly expressed miRNAs. RT-PCR analysis further revealed that nine MDV miRNAs were differentially expressed between 7 dpi and 42 dpi infected spleens. At 7 dpi, three miRNAs were differentially expressed between the spleens of birds coinfected with HVT and MD5 compared with birds individually infected with MD5, whereas at 42 dpi, nine miRNAs were differentially expressed. At 7 dpi, the expression of seven HVT-encoded miRNAs was impaired in the spleens of coinfected birds compared to birds that received the HVT vaccine alone. At 42 dpi, six HVT-encoded miRNAs were differentially expressed between the two groups. Target prediction analysis suggests that these differentially expressed viral miRNAs are involved in the regulation of several cellular processes, including cell proliferation and adaptive immune response. © American Association of Avian Pathologists.",,"Goher, M.;Hicks, J.

674,Application of phylogeny reconstruction and character evolution analysis to infer patterns of directional microbial transmission,"used phylogenetic analyzes to reconstruct patterns of directional interspecific transmission during an outbreak of pseudorabies virus in Illinois, USA, in 1989. Isolates from five species were recovered: cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and raccoons (Procyon lotor). I generated DNA sequences for 16 pseudorabies virus isolates in the glycoprotein C gene, from which I constructed phylogenetic trees. I then used these trees, in combination with parsimony-based analyzes of character evolution, to infer the frequency and direction of interspecific transmission events. Comparison of the inferred frequencies and directions of transmission with the null expectations based on 10,000 random trees indicated a significant excess of pig-to-pig transmission events and a corresponding lack of transmission events from non-porcine species. These results are consistent with the known biology and natural history of pseudorabies virus, and demonstrate that retrospective phylogenetic reconstruction and character evolution analyzes can be used to investigate the transmission ecology of pathogens. © 2003 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Goldberg, T.

675,Bluetongue virus serotype 24 (BTV-24) in Israel: phylogenetic characterization and clinical manifestation of the disease,"Bluetongue (BT), an arthropod-borne viral disease of ruminants, affects sheep more severely than other domestic animals. Bluetongue virus serotype 24 (BTV-24) is one of 26 known serotypes of bluetongue virus (BTV). In this article, we present data from the phylogenetic analysis of 9 viral genes (Seg1, Seg2, Seg3, Seg4, Seg5, Seg6, Seg8, Seg9 and Seg10) from 8 Israeli isolates of BTV-24 and relate the genotype of BTV-24. isolates to their phenotype with respect to clinical manifestations. The high level of genetic identity (>99.6%) between Seg2, Seg4 and Seg5 in the 8 BTV-24 isolates indicated that these segments shared the same viral ancestor. Phylogenetic analysis of Seg1, Seg3, Seg5, Seg8, Seg9 and Seg10 revealed that the Israeli strains of BTV-24 comprised 4 variants. Five of the viruses revealed high identity among all 9 segments and represented variant 1. A second variant (BTV24/3027/6/10), isolated in 2010, showed significant variant 1 variation in 3 gene segments (VP -1, VP-3 and NS-3 genes). A third variant (BTV24/3027/1/10) showed significant variation from variant 1 in 6 segments (VP-1, VP-3, VP-6 and NS-1, NS-2 and NS-3 genes) , while a fourth variant (BTV24/2214/1/10) showed a significant variation of variant 1 in 4 segments (VP-1, NS-1, NS-2 and NS-3 genes). These marked differences in sequence identity indicate that a high level of genetic rearrangement is occurring among co-circulating BTV strains in Israel.",,"Golender, N.;Panshin, A.;Brenner, J.;Rotenberg, D.;Oura, C.;Khinich, E.;Bumbarov, V.",2016.0,,10.12834/VetIt.643.3163.3,0

The viral component of the microbiome (the virome) is receiving increasing attention for its role in neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD). Rotavirus and coronavirus have long been associated with NCDs, and commercial vaccines against these agents have been produced. Recently, several other viruses that may play a role in diarrhea have been discovered in calf fecal samples, mainly by sequence-based methods. These viruses include toroviruses, noroviruses, neboviruses, astroviruses, kobuviruses, and enteroviruses. Most of the studies have involved epidemiological investigations seeking to show the association with diarrhea for each virus alone or in combination with potential pathogens. However, determining the contribution of these viruses to calf diarrhea has been challenging, and much uncertainty remains regarding their roles as primary pathogens, co-infection agents, or commensals.",,"Gomez, D.

Previous studies have reported the prevalence of BVDV species and subgenotypes in cattle from the United States and Canada. We investigated the genetic diversity of BVDV strains detected in bovine serum samples from 6 different Mexican regions. Sixty-two BVDV isolates from Mexico were genetically typed based on sequence comparison of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the viral genome. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicated that 60 of the samples belonged to the BVDV-1 genotype and 2 to the BVDV-2 genotype. Partial 5â€²-UTR sequence comparison pooled 49 samples within BVDV-1c, 8 samples within BVDV-1a, 3 samples within BVDV-1b, and 2 samples pooled with the BVDV-2a subgenotypes.

This paper describes an ultrastructural study of the sequence of lesions produced in the perisinusoidal functional unit of the liver of pigs inoculated with the Malawi '83 strain of African swine fever virus, classified as hemadsorbent and highly virulent. Virus replication was observed in Kupffer cells and monocytes from three days after inoculation, in hepatocytes and fat-storing cells at five and seven days after inoculation, and in sinusoidal endothelial cells at seven days. after inoculation. Other observations included intravascular coagulation, which peaked five days after inoculation, and fibroblast and myofibroblast transformation of fat-storing cells seven days after inoculation.

681,"Molecular investigation of bovine viral diarrhea virus infection in yaks (Bos gruniens) from Qinghai, China","Background: Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a pestivirus that infects both domestic animals and wild species throughout the world. In China, cattle are often infected with BVDV of different genotypes, but there is very limited knowledge about BVDV infection in Chinese yaks and the genetic diversity of the virus. The objectives of this study were to detect viral infection in yaks in Qinghai, China and to determine BVDV genotypes based on analysis of the 5” untranslated region (5”UTR) and N-terminal protease (N <sup>pro). </ sup>) region. Results: Between 2010 and 2012, 407 blood samples were collected from yaks with or without clinical signs in six counties in Qinghai province. Ninety-eight samples (24%) were positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting a conserved region of BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. The nucleotide sequences of the entire 5â€²UTR and N<sup>pro</sup> region were determined for 16 positive samples. Phylogenetic reconstructions showed that the 16 samples belong to the subgenotypes BVDV-1b, BVDV-1d and BVDV-1q. Conclusions: This study provides, for the first time, molecular evidence of BVDV infection in yaks in Qinghai involving multiple BVDV-1 subgenotypes. This may have occurred under three possible scenarios: interspecies transmission, natural infection, and use of BVDV-contaminated vaccines. The results have important implications for yak production and management in China, specifically indicating that unscientific vaccination practices should be stopped and biosecurity increased. © 2014 Gong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Gong, X.;Liu, L.;Zheng, F.;Chen, Q.;Li, Z.;Cao, X.;Yin, H.;Zhou, J.;Cai, X.",2014.0,,10.1186/1743-422x-11-29,0

Here, we report the discovery of two novel lineages of retroelements, which we designate hepadnavirus-like retroelement (HEART1 and HEART2), within insect genomes through the screening of 1,095 eukaryotic genomes. Both phylogenetic and similarity analyzes suggest that HEART retroelements represent the closest non-viral relatives of hepadnaviruses to date.

683,Global spread of hemorrhagic fever viruses: predicting pandemics,"As successive epidemics have swept the world, the scientific community has quickly learned from them about the occurrence and transmission of communicable diseases. Epidemics often occur when health systems are unprepared. During an unexpected epidemic, health authorities engage in damage control, fear drives action, and the desire to understand the threat is greater. As humanity recovers, policymakers are looking to scientific expertise to improve their ""preparedness"" for future events. The global spread of disease is exemplified by the spread of yellow fever from Africa to the Americas, the spread of dengue fever through the transcontinental migration of mosquitoes, the ongoing pandemics of the influenza virus, and more recently, the unexpected appearance of the Ebola virus. distributed by motorcycles and long-distance carriers. Other pathogens that are notable for their epidemic expansions include arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers and hantavirus diseases transmitted by rodents over great geographic distances and arthropod-borne viruses (West Nile, chikungunya, and Zika) enabled by ecology and vector adaptations. . Did we learn from past epidemics? Are we prepared for the worst? The ultimate goal is to develop a resilient global health infrastructure. In addition to acquiring treatments, vaccines and other preventive medicine, biosurveillance is essential to prevent the appearance of diseases and counteract their spread. So far, only the Western Hemisphere has a large and established monitoring system; however, diseases continue to emerge sporadically, particularly in Southeast Asia and South America, highlighting the imperfections of our surveillance. Epidemics destabilize fragile governments, devastate the most vulnerable populations and threaten the global community. Pandemic risk calculations employ new technologies such as computerized maintenance of geographic and historical data sets, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), next-generation sequencing, and metagenomics to track molecular changes in pathogens during their emergence, and mathematical models to assess the risk. Predictions help identify emergency hotspots, populations at risk, and genetically evolving pathogens. Preparedness anticipates the risks, the needs of the population, the capacities of the infrastructure, the sources of emergency financing and, finally, the international alliances necessary to manage a disaster before it occurs. The world is currently in an intermediate phase of trying to reduce health disparities despite exponential population growth, political conflict, migration, global trade, urbanization, and major environmental changes due to global warming. . For the sake of humanity, we must focus on building the necessary capabilities for health surveillance, epidemic preparedness, and pandemic response.",,"Gonzalez, J.

684,"Origin, distribution and possible risk factors associated with influenza A virus in pigs in two production systems in Guatemala","Background: Guatemala is the country with the largest pig production in Central America; however, the evidence for influenza A virus (IAV) in pigs has not been clearly delineated. Objectives: In this study, we analyzed the presence and spatial distribution of IAV in populations of commercial and backyard pigs. Methods: Samples from two national surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011 were analyzed by virological (rRT-PCR and virus isolation) and serological (ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition) assays for IAV. Results: Influenza A virus was detected in 15.7% of sampled pigs (30.6% of herds) in 2010 and in 11.7% (24.2% of herds) in 2011. The percentage of seropositive pigs was 10.6% (16.1% of herds) and 1.4% (3.1% of herds) for each year, respectively. Three pandemic H1N1 viruses and one seasonal human-like H3N2 virus were isolated. Antibodies against viruses of different genetic groups were detected. No reassortant strains with porcine viruses were detected. The H3N2 virus was closely related to human viruses that circulated in Central America in 2010, distinct from the more recent human seasonal vaccine lineages. Each year spatial groups of rRT-PCR positive herds were detected by scanning statistics. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the circulation of IAV in Guatemala and identify commercial farms, animal health status, and age as potential risk factors associated with IAV infection and exposure. The detection of viruses of human origin in pigs suggests a role for humans in the molecular epidemiology of IAV in pigs in Guatemala and evidences gaps in local animal and human surveillance.",,"Gonzalez-Reiche, A.

689,Detection and genome characterization of bovine polyomaviruses in beef muscle and ground beef samples from Germany,"Polyomaviruses are small, circular, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses. Some polyomaviruses can induce tumors and cancer under certain circumstances. Bovine polyomaviruses (BPyV) 1-3 have been poorly analyzed so far. It was hypothesized that consumption of polyomavirus-containing beef might contribute to the development of cancer in humans. To assess the distribution of the BPyV genome in meat from Germany, 101 beef muscle samples and 10 ground beef samples were analyzed here. A specific sample preparation method combined with or without rolling circle amplification (RCA) and BPyV-specific PCR was developed and applied. BPyV-1 DNA was detected in 1/101 (1%) of beef samples and 2/10 (20%) of ground beef samples. BPyV-2 DNA was detected in 3/10 (30%) of the ground beef samples, while BPyV-3 was not detected in the samples. The application of RCA did not increase the detection rate in ground beef samples. Sequence analysis of the PCR products indicated the presence of BPyV-1, BPyV-2a and BPyV-2b. The complete genome of a ground beef BPyV-1 strain showed 97.8% sequence identity with the BPyV-1 reference strain and that of a ground beef BPyV-2a strain showed 97.8% sequence identity. 99.9% with the 2aS11 strain. It can be concluded that BPyV genomes can be frequently detected in ground beef samples, although a larger number of samples should be investigated in the future to confirm this finding. Further studies should focus on the infectivity, tumorigenicity, and heat resistance of contained viruses to assess the risk of cancer induction through consumption of BPyV present in beef products.

690,Advances in the development of antiviral vaccines,"Antiviral vaccines have been the most successful biomedical intervention to prevent epidemic viral diseases. Vaccination against smallpox in humans and rinderpest in cattle was the basis for the eradication of the disease, and recent advances in polio eradication are promising. Although the first vaccines were developed empirically by passage in live animals or eggs, more recent vaccines have been developed due to the advent of new technologies, notably cell culture and molecular biology. Recent technological advances in gene delivery and expression, nanoparticles, protein manufacturing, and adjuvants have created the potential for new vaccine platforms that may provide solutions for vaccines against viral pathogens for which no interventions currently exist. Furthermore, the technological convergence of human monoclonal antibody isolation, structural biology, and high-throughput sequencing is providing new opportunities for the design of immunogens at the atomic level. Screening of human monoclonal antibodies can identify immunodominant antigenic sites associated with neutralization and provide reagents to stabilize and resolve the structure of viral surface proteins. Understanding the structural basis of neutralization can guide vaccine target selection. Deep sequencing of the antibody repertoire and definition of the ontogeny of desired antibody responses can reveal the somatic mutation and junctional recombination requirements for B-cell recognition and affinity maturation. Taken together, this information will provide new strategic approaches to selecting vaccine antigens, formulations and regimens. Furthermore, it creates the potential for rational vaccine design and the establishment of a catalog of vaccine technology platforms that would be effective against any given family or class of viral pathogens and would improve our readiness to address new emerging viral threats.

691,Genital zoster: the great impostor,"Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) are taxonomically closely related viruses that cause clinically distinct diseases but share common features of infection. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 cause primary cutaneous and mucocutaneous infections, followed by reactivation of disease occurring at or near the same anatomic site. Primary VZV infection, also known as chickenpox, is usually a childhood disease that produces smallpox-like skin lesions distributed throughout the body. Reactivation of VZV infection, often called herpes zoster, usually occurs later in life but, unlike HSV disease, produces smallpox-like lesions in a different anatomic location, typically along the the dermatomes. As such, the clinical differential diagnosis of reactivation of HSV infection and herpes zoster is generally based on the anatomic location and appearance of the lesion(s). The recent availability of molecular assays has resulted in the unexpected diagnosis of zoster infections in male and female patients presenting with genital lesions. The purpose of this article is to present a brief description of HSV and VZV infections and to report a laboratory experience that resulted in the diagnosis of zoster infections using a molecular assay in which nearly 10% of 282 samples positive for VZV originated from genital sites.",,"Granato, P.

This has been largely attributed to the emergence of a variety of new known and ""unknown"" emerging diseases. Previous studies have shown that colonies can often harbor more than one pathogen, making it difficult to identify etiologic agents with classical methods. By employing an unbiased metagenomics approach, which allows detection of unexpected and previously unknown infectious agents, detection of three viruses, lethal aphid paralysis virus (ALPV), Israel acute paralysis virus (IAPV) and Lake Sinai virus (LSV), in bees from Spain is reported in this article. The existence of a subgroup of ALPV with the ability to infect bees was recently reported and this is the first identification of such a strain in Europe. Similarly, LSV appears to be an unclassified group of viruses with an unclear impact on colony health, and these viruses have not previously been identified outside of the United States. Furthermore, our study also reveals that these bees carried a plant virus, turnip ringspot virus (TuRSV), which could serve as important vector organisms.

693,Whole genome sequence comparison of vtx2 converting phage from enteroaggregative hemorrhagic Escherichia coli strains,"BACKGROUND: Enteroaggregative hemorrhagic E. coli (EAHEC) is a new pathogenic group of E. coli characterized by the presence of a vtx2 phage integrated into the genomic backbone of enteroaggregative E. coli (EAggEC). To date, four different EAHEC serotypes have been described that caused, in addition to the large outbreak of infection that occurred in Germany in 2011, a small outbreak and six sporadic cases of HUS in the period 1992-2012. In the present work, we determine the complete genome sequence of the phage vtx2, called Phi-191, present in the first described EAHEC O111:H2 isolated in France in 1992, and we compare it with those of the vtx phages whose sequences were available. RESULTS: The complete genome sequence of phage Phi-191 was identical to that of phage vtx2 P13374 present in strain EAHEC O104:H4 isolated during the German outbreak 20 years later. In addition, it was also almost identical to those of the other vtx2 phages of EAHEC O104:H4 strains described so far. In contrast, Phi-191 phage appeared to be different from the vtx2 phage carried by EAHEC O111:H21 isolated in Northern Ireland in 2012. Comparison of vtx2 phage sequences from EAHEC strains with those of vtx phage from EAHEC strains. Typical verocytotoxin-producing E. coli showed the presence of a 900 bp sequence associated only with EAHEC phage and encoding a tail fiber. CONCLUSIONS: At least two different vtx2 phages, both characterized by the presence of a peculiar gene encoding the tail fiber, were involved in the appearance of EAHEC. The finding of an identical vtx2 phage in two EAggEC strains isolated after 20 years despite the high variability described for vtx phages is unexpected and suggests that these vtx2 phages remain under strong selective pressure. The observation that different EAHEC infections have been traced to countries where EAggEC infections are endemic and human sewage treatment is often ineffective suggests that such countries may represent the cradle for the emergence of the EAHEC pathotype. In these regions, EAggECs of human origin can widely contaminate the environment where they can be found with free vtx phages that are likely to be spread in ruminant excreta.",,"Grande, L.;Michelacci, V.;Tozzoli, R.;Ranieri, P.;Maugliani, A.;Caprioli, A.;Morabito, S.",2014.0,2008-07-01 00:00:00,,0

Gene collinearity with the KSHV genome was observed, and core herpesvirus genes had strong sequence homology to the corresponding KSHV genes. RFHVMn lacked homologues of open reading frame 11 (ORF11) and KSHV ORFs K5 and K6, which appear to have been generated by duplication of ORFs K3 and K4 after divergence of KSHV and RFHV. RFHVMn contained positional homologues of all other unique KSHV genes, although some showed limited sequence similarity. RFHVMn contained several candidate microRNA genes. Although there was little sequence similarity to KSHV microRNAs, one candidate contained the same seed sequence as the positional homologue, kshv-miR-K12-10a, suggesting functional overlap. RNA transcript splicing was highly conserved between RFHVMn and KSHV, and strong sequence conservation was observed at specific promoters and putative origins of replication, predicting important functional similarities. Sequence comparisons indicated that RFHVMn and KSHV developed in long-term synchrony with the evolution of their hosts, and both viruses cluster phylogenetically within the RV1 lineage of Old World primate rhadinoviruses. RFHVMn is the closest fully sequenced homologue of KSHV and the first sequenced rhadinovirus RV1 homologue of KSHV from an Old World non-human primate. The strong genetic and sequence similarity between RFHVMn and KSHV, together with similarities in biology and pathology, demonstrate that RFHVMn infection in macaques offers an important and relevant model for the study of KSHV in humans. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Gregory Bruce, A.;Ryan, J.

697,A metagenomic analysis of pandemic influenza A (2009 H1N1) infection in North American patients.,"Although metagenomics has previously been employed for pathogen discovery, its cost and complexity have precluded its use as a practical first-line diagnostic for unknown infectious diseases. Here we demonstrate the utility of two metagenomics-based strategies, a panviral microarray (Virochip) and deep sequencing, for the identification and characterization of the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus. Using nasopharyngeal swabs collected during the early stages of the pandemic. in Mexico, Canada, and the United States (n = 17), the Virochip was able to detect a new virus more closely related to swine influenza viruses without prior information. Deep sequencing yielded 2009 H1N1 influenza reads in each sample (percentage of 2009 H1N1 aligned sequences ranged from 0.0011% to 10.9%), with up to 97% coverage of the H1N1 genome. influenza in a sample. Detection of 2009 H1N1 by deep sequencing was possible even at titers close to the detection limits for specific RT-PCR, and the percentage of sequence reads correlated linearly with virus titer. Deep sequencing also provided information on upper respiratory microbiota and host gene expression in response to 2009 H1N1 infection. An unbiased analysis combining sequence data from all 17 outbreak samples revealed that 90% of the genome of the 2009 H1N1 flu could be assembled de novo without the use of any reference sequence, including the assembly of several nearly complete genome segments. These results indicate that an optimized metagenomics screening strategy can potentially replace the multiple conventional diagnostic tests required to investigate a new pathogen outbreak and provide a model for the comprehensive diagnosis of acute illness or unexplained outbreaks in clinical and public health settings. . © 2010 Greninger et al.",,"Greninger, A.

698,The complete klassevirus genome: a new picornavirus in pediatric feces,"Background: Diarrhea kills 2 million children worldwide each year, yet no etiologic agent is found in approximately 30-50% of cases. Picornaviral genera such as enteroviruses, kobuviruses, cosaviruses, parechoviruses, hepatoviruses, teschoviruses, and cardioviruses have been found in human and animal diarrhoea. Modern technologies, especially deep sequencing, enable rapid, high-throughput screening of clinical samples, such as stool, for novel infectious agents associated with human disease. Results: A pool of 141 pediatric gastroenteritis specimens that were previously negative for known diarrheal viruses underwent pyrosequencing. From a total of 937,935 sequence reads, a collection of 849 reads distantly related to Aichi virus was assembled and found to comprise 75% of a novel picornavirus genome. The entire genome was subsequently cloned and found to share 52.3% nucleotide pairwise identity and 38.9% amino acid identity with Aichi virus. The low level of sequence identity suggests a new genus of picornaviruses that we have named klasseviruses. Blind examination of 751 stool samples from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals revealed a second positive case of klassevirus infection, which was later found to be from the 11-month-old twin of the index case. Conclusion: We report the discovery of human klassevirus 1, a member of a novel genus of picornaviruses, in the feces of two Northern California infants. Additional characterization and epidemiological studies will be required to establish whether klasseviruses are significant causes of human infection.",,"Greninger, A. L.;Runckel, C.;Chiu, C.

700,Molecular characterization of influenza A H3N2 viruses isolated from Ontario pigs in 2011 and 2012,"Background: Data on the molecular diversity of type A influenza viruses that commonly circulate in Ontario pigs are sparse. However, this information is essential for animal and public health surveillance, vaccine updates, and understanding the evolution of the virus and its large-scale spread. Methods: The study population consisted of 21 pig herds with clinical problems due to respiratory disease. Nasal swabs were collected from individual pigs and analyzed by virus isolation on MDCK cells and by rtRT-PCR. All eight segments of 10 H3N2 viruses were sequenced by high-throughput sequencing and molecularly characterized. Results: The prevalence within the herd ranged from 2 to 100%. Structurally, the Ontario H3N2 viruses could be classified into three different groups. Group 1 was the most similar to the original 2005 trH3N2 virus. Group 2 was the most similar to the Ontario turkey H3N2 isolates with PB1 and NS genes that originated from the trH3N2 virus and M, PB2, PA and M genes. NPs that originated from the A(H1N1 )pdm09 virus. All Group 3 internal genes were genetically related to A(H1N1)pdm09. Analysis of HA1 antigenic sites showed that Group 1 had 8 aa changes within 4 antigenic sites, A(1), B(3), C(2), and E(2). Group 2 viruses had 8 aa changes within 3 antigenic sites A(3), B(3), and C(2), while Group 3 viruses had 4 aa changes within 3 antigenic sites, B( 1), D(1), and E(2), compared to group IV H3N2 virus [A/swine/Ontario/33853/2005/(H3N2)]. Conclusions: Characterization of the Ontario H3N2 viruses clearly indicates a reassortment of genetic segments between the North American swine group IV trH3N2 virus and the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.",,"GrgiÄ‡, H.;Costa, M.;Friendship, R.

701,"Prevalence of hepatitis E virus infection in pigs at slaughter, UK, 2013","Since 2010, reports of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection have increased in England and Wales. Despite mounting evidence on the zoonotic potential of porcine HEV, there are limited data on its prevalence in pigs in the UK. We investigated the prevalence of antibodies, active infection, and virus variation in serum samples and cecal contents from 629 pigs at the slaughterhouse. The prevalence of antibodies against HEV was 92.8% (584/629) and HEV RNA was detected in 15% of cecal contents (93/629), 3% of plasma samples (22/629) and 2% of both (14/629). 629). However, although HEV is prevalent in UK pigs and viremic pigs are entering the food chain, most viral sequences (22/23) clustered separately from the dominant type seen in humans. Therefore, pigs farmed in the UK are unlikely to be the main source of human HEV infections in the UK. More research is needed to identify the source of these infections.",,"Grierson, S.;Heaney, J.;Cheney, T.;Morgan, D.;Wyllie, S.;Powell, L.;Smith, D.;Ijaz, S.;Steinbach, F.;Choudhury, B.;Tedder, R.

Although clinically unapparent in pigs, HEV infection is the cause of hepatitis E in humans and transmission through the food chain has been established. Following a 2013 study investigating the prevalence of HEV infection in UK slaughter-age pigs, samples indicating the highest viral load were selected for further characterization. High-throughput sequencing was used to obtain the complete coding sequence for five samples. An in-frame insertion within the HEV hypervariable region was observed in two samples. To question whether this mutation may be the cause of the high level of viremia and fecal excretion, as observed in the sampled pigs, virus isolation and culture were carried out. Based on viral growth kinetics, there was no evidence that these insertions affected replication efficiency in vitro, suggesting that as yet undetermined host factors may affect the course of infection and, consequently, the risk of transmission. food.",,"Grierson, S.

703,Genomic epidemiology of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus through colonization and infection of skin and soft tissues,"OBJECTIVES: Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI-Sa) places a significant burden on healthcare systems. New Zealand has a high incidence of Sa-SSTI, and here most of the morbidity is caused by a polyclonal methicillin-sensitive bacterial population (MSSA). However, MSSA also asymptomatically colonizes the cornified epithelium of approximately 20% of the population, and its division between commensalism and pathogenicity is poorly understood. Our goal was to see if MSSA differ genetically through colonization and SSTI; and given the close interactions between people and pets, whether strains isolated from pets differ from human strains. METHODS: We compared genomes from contemporary colonization and clinical isolates of MSSA obtained in New Zealand from humans and pets. RESULTS: Core and accessory genome comparisons revealed a homogeneous bacterial population across colonization, disease, humans, and pets. The MSSA colonization rate in dogs was comparatively low (5.4%). CONCLUSIONS: In New Zealand, most Sa-SSTI morbidity is caused by a random sample of the colonizing MSSA population, according to the opportunistic infection model rather than the paradigm that distinguishes strains according to their pathogenicity. Therefore, studies of the factors that determine colonization and immune escape may be more beneficial than comparative virulence studies.

Using this technique, an unambiguous species assignment was achieved for 34 potyvirus-infected vanilla samples collected from the Indian and Pacific Ocean areas between 1997 and 2005. Virus identification was based on BLAST homology and nucleotide identities of 162 to 327 nt fragments with known potyvirus sequences. Species assignment was confirmed by neighbor binding of the 149 nt common to 32 known vanilla and 51 potyvirus sequences. Subject to further identification, these data revealed four additional species of Potyvirus that can infect vanilla: bean yellow mosaic virus, cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus, Ornithogalum mosaic virus, and cowpea mosaic virus.

706,"Varicella-zoster virus-specific gp140: a highly immunogenic, disulfide-linked structural glycoprotein","140,000-dalton disulfide-linked glycoprotein (gp140) specified by varicella-zoster virus (VZV) was identified in infected cultured cells and precipitated by two murine monoclonal antibodies (VZ-151 and VZ-158). When analyzed under reducing conditions by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gp140 was predominantly cleaved to a lower 66,000 molecular weight product (gp66). This protein was classified as a viral structural component, as it was observed in the polypeptide profile of metrizamide gradient-purified enveloped virions. Using immunofluorescence analysis with a monoclonal antibody probe, it was documented that gp140 expression was highly conserved both in cultured cells inoculated with homologous (VZV-Oka) and heterologous (VZV-32) strains and in infected human tissues from chickenpox patients. and shingles. That the glycoprotein was highly immunogenic was confirmed by the presence of high titer anti-gp140 antibodies in the sera of hyperimmunized laboratory animals and naturally infected humans. Temporally, the humoral response to gp140 after primary VZV infection preceded the response to the other viral glycoproteins. These studies therefore describe an immunogenic disulfide-linked viral structural glycoprotein to be included among the five other previously described VZV-specific fucosylated species: gp118, gp98, gp88, gp62 and gp45.",,"Grose, C.;Edwards, D.

The data is accumulated from the literature and own experiences. The clinical picture of this new disease, which led to significant economic losses, is dominated by 1. a higher rate of reduction in the duration of pregnancy with late abortion before day 110 or a longer duration of pregnancy; 2. an increase in stillborn piglets; 3. a higher scale of mortality before weaning combined with a higher frequency of secondary infections. Pathological findings in piglets are subcutaneous oedema, fluid accumulation in body cavities, and interstitial pneumonia is occasionally seen. In sows from affected farms examined before farrowing, mononuclear placentitis occurs. Currently, an unclassified virus isolated by Dutch investigators is proposed to be the causative agent and is named Lelystad virus.",,"grosse Beilage, E.;Stockhofe-Zurwieden, N.;SchÃ¶ttker-Wegner, H.

Therefore, we first established a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based protocol, which enables unbiased identification of transcripts in virus particles. Subsequently, we applied our protocol to analyze RNA in an emerging zoonotic member of the Poxviridae family, namely Cowpox virus. Our results revealed the incorporation of 19 viral transcripts, while host identifications were restricted to ribosomal and mitochondrial RNA. Most of the viral transcripts had an unknown immunomodulatory function, suggesting that transcript incorporation may be beneficial for poxvirus immune evasion. In particular, the most abundant transcript originated from the D5L/I1R gene that encodes a viral inhibitor of the host cytoplasmic DNA sensing machinery.",,"Grossegesse, M.;Doellinger, J.;Haldemann, B.;Schaade, L.;Nitsche, A.",2017.0,10 13,,0
709,Combined proteomics/genomics approach reveals proteomic changes of mature virions as a novel adaptation mechanism of poxviruses,"DNA viruses, such as poxviruses, have a very stable genome, suggesting that adaptation of viral particles to specific cell types is not limited to genomic changes. Cowpox viruses are zoonotic poxviruses with an extraordinarily wide host range, demonstrating their adaptive potential in vivo. To elucidate the adaptation mechanisms of poxviruses, we isolated cowpox virus particles from a rat and passaged them five times in a human and rat cell line. Subsequently, we analyzed the proteome and genome of the non-passage virions and each passage. While the overall viral genome sequence remained stable during passage, proteomics revealed multiple changes in virion composition. Interestingly, higher viral fitness was observed in human cells in the presence of higher amounts of immunomodulatory protein. As the only minor variant with increasing frequency during passage was localized to a viral RNA polymerase subunit and, in addition, most of the minor variants were found in transcription-associated genes, protein amounts were presumably down-regulated. transcript level. This study is the first comparative proteome analysis of virus particles before and after cell culture propagation, revealing proteomic changes as a novel mechanism of poxvirus adaptation.",,"Grossegesse, M.;Doellinger, J.;Tyshaieva, A.;Schaade, L.;Nitsche, A.",2017.0,11 10,,0

Here we present a method for the detection of biological samples by optical mapping of their DNA. We use a novel one-step chemoenzymatic reaction to covalently attach fluorophores to DNA at the four-base recognition sites of a DNA methyltransferase. Due to the diffraction limit of light, the dense distribution of labels results in a continuous fluorescent signal throughout the DNA. Amplitude modulations (AM) of fluorescence intensity along stretched DNA molecules exhibit a unique molecular fingerprint that can be used for identification. We show that this labeling scheme is highly informative, allowing for accurate genotyping. We demonstrate the method by labeling the genomes of bacteriophages lambda and T7, resulting in a unique and consistent AM profile for each genome. These profiles are also successfully used for the identification of phages from a background phage library. Our method can provide an easy route for the detection and typing of various organisms and has potential applications in metagenomic studies of various ecosystems.",,"Grunwald, A.;Dahan, M.;Giesbertz, A.;Nilsson, A.;Nyberg, L.

The main clinical symptoms were abortion in pregnant sows, fatal neurological signs in piglets and respiratory disease in growing pigs. Histopathological examination revealed necrotic splenitis, hepatitis and lymphadenitis, hemorrhagic nephritis, and non-suppurative encephalitis. Typical eosinophilic inclusion bodies were found in the nuclei of liver cells. Using PCR, 110 samples among 395 clinical cases tested positive for the gE gene. Fifteen vPRV strains were isolated and confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the gE gene. The strains shared 97.1% to 99.9% nucleotide (nt) and 96.6% to 99.5% amino acid (aa) homology with the PRV reference strains. Selection pressure analysis showed that a site in the codons of glycoprotein E was under positive selection. Of the 5,033 serum samples, 2,909 were positive by ELISA for a positivity rate of 57.8%.

To investigate the genetic makeup, Dk/SD/009/08 underwent genome sequencing. The cleavage site amino acid motif was ""PLRERRRK-R/GL"", which was consistent with the characterization of HPAIV. Under the newer unified nomenclature system for H5N1, Dk/SD/009/08 was classified in Clade 2.3.4. BLAST results showed that four gene segments (HA, NA, NP, and NS) had the highest nucleotide identities with AIVs of the H5N1 subtype, while the remaining four (PB2, PB1, PA, and M) showed the highest relationship. closest to the H9N2 subtype. Therefore, Dk/SD/009/08 could be a natural recombinant virus.

Orf virus was identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), recurrent infection test, transmission electron microscopy, and PCR. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of two Orf virus genes were analyzed. The results showed that under electron microscopy the virus had the presence of typical parapoxvirus virions and there were many eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. In the ELISA test, the optical density (OD) readings of the sample showed a positive result, and the virus-infected rabbits showed an appearance typically infected by Orf virus. All of these findings proved that the sample was an Orf virus. Phylogenetic studies of Orf B2L and Orf F1L genes showed that the virus clustered in different branches and was closer to Orf Nantou virus (DQ904351) and OV-SA00 (AY386264) isolates.

According to a differential expression analysis between mock-infected and PRV-infected cells, 4151 host lncRNAs were significantly upregulated and 2327 host lncRNAs were significantly downregulated in the latter group. Viral lncRNAs and several host lncRNAs were verified by Northern blot and real-time PCR. The findings showed that the viral LDI lncRNA could regulate the expression of IE180, a potent transcriptional activator of viral genes.

718,Detection and characterization of new bocaviruses (genus Bocaparvovirus) and gastroenteritis viruses from asymptomatic pigs in Ireland,"BACKGROUND: Livestock have been the putative source of several human epidemics in recent years, eg, H1N1 influenza, G8/G9 rotavirus, and MERS-CoV. Surveillance of new viruses in animals is essential to assess the risk to human and animal health and to determine any economic impact, for example growth failure. There is a paucity of data on the detection and characterization of gastroenteritis viruses, particularly novel viruses, in pigs in Ireland. Recently, a number of novel small porcine DNA viruses have emerged worldwide, for example, torque teno sus virus, porcine bocavirus, and parvoviruses 2 and 4, and little is known about the biology and potential pathogenicity of these viruses. . Bocaparvovirus is a genetically distinct group of viruses that has recently been detected in humans and animals. METHODS: In this study, the presence of gastroenteritis viruses (rotavirus A, porcine circovirus, adenovirus, and porcine bocavirus) was investigated in a selection of archived faecal samples from asymptomatic piglets from a commercial farm in Ireland. A total of 104 samples were pooled and analyzed using conventional molecular techniques (PCR and RT-PCR), then a subset of samples (n=44) were examined individually. Viral diversity was then investigated using statistical and phylogenetic techniques. RESULTS: The initial detection showed a high prevalence of PBoV in this farm, with the formation of three distinct groups in the phylogenetic analysis.

719,H1N1 Influenza Virus Epitopes Classified by Monoclonal Antibodies,"Epitopes play an important role in influenza infection. It can be useful in screening for universal influenza virus vaccines by analyzing epitopes on multiple hemagglutinin (HA) protein subtypes. A total of 40 previously derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from influenza virus HA antigens (development and characterization of 40 mAbs generated with H1N1 influenza virus split vaccines were previously published) were used to detect and classify mAbs. in different subcategories of influenza viruses using the ELISA method. Following this, common continuous amino acid sequences were identified by multiple sequence alignment analysis with the GenBank database and DNAMAN software, for use in predicting HA protein epitopes. Peptides synthesized from these common sequences were prepared and used to verify and determine predicted linear epitopes through localization and distribution analysis. Using these methods, nine linear HA epitopes distributed among different influenza virus strains were identified, including three for influenza A, four for 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza, and two for H1. The present study showed that considering a combination of the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction, the variation in the influenza virus HA protein, and the linear epitopes may present a useful approach to design effective multi-epitope vaccines. In addition, the study aimed to clarify the cause and pathogenic mechanism of influenza HA virus-induced influenza, and presents a novel idea to identify the epitopes of other pathogenic microorganisms.",,"Guo, C.

720,Highly pathogenic influenza A(H5Nx) viruses with altered H5 receptor binding specificity,"The emergence and intercontinental spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5Nx) viruses from clade 2.3.4.4 is unprecedented. The H5N8 and H5N2 viruses have caused great economic loss in the poultry industry in Europe and North America, and fatal human infections with the H5N6 virus have occurred in Asia. Knowledge of the evolution of receptor binding specificity of these viruses, which could affect host range, is urgently needed. We report that the appearance of these viruses is accompanied by a change in receptor binding specificity. Unlike the ancestral clade 2.3.4 H5 proteins, the new clade 2.3.4.4 H5 proteins bind fucosylated sialosides due to the K222Q and S227R substitutions, which are unique to highly pathogenic influenza virus H5 proteins. . Virus isolates from clade 2.3.4.4 from North America have retained only the K222Q substitution but still bind fucosylated sialosides. Altered receptor-binding specificity of H5 proteins from virus clade 2.3.4.4 could have contributed to the emergence and spread of H5Nx viruses.",,"Guo, H.;de Vries, E.;McBride, R.;Dekkers, J.;Peng, W.;Bouwman, K.

722,Identification and genomic characterization of a new CRESS DNA virus from a calf with severe hemorrhagic enteritis in China,"In this study, a single-stranded DNA virus (CRESS) encoding a circular replication-associated protein (Rep) was discovered in a diarrheal sample from a calf with severe hemorrhagic enteritis. The virus, called Bo-Circus type CH virus, has a circular genome with 3909 nucleotides (nt). Six putative open reading frames (ORFs), including Rep, capsid (Cap), and four proteins of unknown function, were identified. Both in terms of genome size and the number and organization of encoded ORFs, the Bo-Circo-like virus CH is most closely related to the Po-Circo-like virus 21 detected in pig feces. A preliminary survey using primers specific to the Rep region showed that 5.3% (4/75) of the diarrheal samples were positive for Bo-Circus-like virus, and all 42 healthy samples were negative. In conclusion, our results indicate that the Bo-Circo-like CH virus may represent a new virus in cattle.

723,Detection and molecular characteristics of neboviruses in dairy cows in China,"In this study, 98 diarrheal and 70 non-diarrheal samples were collected from 13 dairy farms located in 5 provinces of China from April 2017 to May 2018. Approximately 41.8% (41/98) of the diarrheal samples and 5 .7% (4/70) of non-diarrheal samples were positive for neboviruses based on RT-PCR results, and some diarrheal samples were co-infected with bovine rotavirus (73.2%), bovine coronavirus (36.6%) and/or bovine viral diarrhea virus (31.7%). A phylogenetic analysis of 23 nebovirus RdRp fragments showed that these strains were closely related to the Nebraska-like (NB-like) strains, but all were located on a single large branch. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of the 18 complete VP1 sequences from this study revealed that 14 strains belonged to lineage 1 and 4 strains belonged to lineage 3. Notably, all four lineage 3 strains shared the same recombination event, with a point of rupture located within the P1A. domain. The complete genome of a nebovirus strain, Bo/YLA-2/17/CH, that had a recombination event within the P1A domain of its VP1, was successfully sequenced and found to be 7453 nt in length, and this may represent a new nebovirus strain based on phylogenetic analysis of its complete genome sequence. In conclusion, this study reveals that neboviruses circulate widely in dairy cows in China and exhibit unique RdRp evolution. To our knowledge, this is the first reported recombination event located within the P1A domain of nebovirus VP1.",,"Guo, Z.;He, Q.;Zhang, B.;Yue, H.;Tang, C.",2019.0,Jan,,0
724,Sequence analysis of the Meq oncogene among Indian isolates of Marek's disease herpesvirus,"Marek's disease (MD), caused by Marek's disease virus (MDV), is a highly contagious neoplastic disease of chickens that can be prevented by vaccination. However, in recent years many cases of vaccine failure have been reported around the world, as chickens develop symptoms of MD despite adequate vaccination. Various polymorphisms and point mutations in the MDV Meq gene have been reported to be associated with virulence and oncogenicity. The present study was carried out with the aim of isolating and characterizing field isolates of MDV on the basis of the Meq gene. Twenty-five samples from suspected MDV cases were collected and processed for virus isolation in primary culture of duck embryo fibroblasts (DEF), where 28% (7 of 25) of the samples showed cytopathic effects characteristic of MDV in the form of plates and syncytia. PCR confirmed additional evidence for the presence of MDV in these samples. To analyze the diversity in the seven MDV isolates, a polymorphism study was carried out by cloning and sequencing the full length of the Meq gene (1020 bp). The sequence homology of 7 isolates with 23 reference strains showed a similarity of 98.10 to 99.40% in the nucleotide sequences and 95.90 to 98.50% in the amino acid sequences. Six isolates revealed 5 repeat sequences of 4 prolines (PPPP), while one isolate revealed only 4 repeats. In the phylogenetic analysis, these isolates formed a separate group that showed a close relationship with the Chinese isolates. The study indicates a high mutation rate in MDV field isolates that may be the likely cause of vaccination failure.",,"Gupta, M.;Deka, D.;Ramneek",2016.0,,10.1016/j.mgene.2016.07.009,0

Therefore, this isolate could be grouped into BHV-1.1 (respiratory form of BHV-1). Few restriction endonucleases produced a distinct restriction profile of BHV-1 DNA.

The sequences were compared with each other and with those from other Asian countries. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, viruses could be grouped into four genotypes (genotypes I-IV). The 61 isolates from India belong to a single genotype (genotype-II) which is subdivided into three lineages (B1, B2 and B3) under the same genotype. B1 and B3 lineage viruses were found to be more prevalent before 1996, while B2 lineage viruses appeared to be new variants responsible for most of the recent outbreaks. Most B1 lineage isolates lack an amino acid in the VP1 protein (position 44) while most B2 and B3 lineage isolates do, indicating the possibility that these lineages may have evolved independently. The rate of evolution of FMDV Asia 1 virus was also estimated and found to be 2.7 x 10(-2) synonymous substitutions per nucleotide per year.",,"Gurumurthy, C.

727,Turkey's coronavirus is more closely related to avian infectious bronchitis virus than to mammalian coronaviruses: a review,"Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) is the cause of a highly contagious acute enteric disease of turkeys. In recent years, TCoV has been increasingly recognized in North America as a major pathogen of young turkeys, leading to economic losses due to poor growth and poor feed conversion. Although the epidemiology and pathogenesis of TCoV have been extensively studied, TCoV remains one of the least characterized coronaviruses. Bird and mammalian coronaviruses have been subdivided into distinct antigenic/genotypic groups; however, the classification of TCoV has been controversial. Previous studies indicated that TCoV was closely related to bovine coronavirus and other mammalian group 2 coronaviruses, but more recent genomic and antigenic sequence analyzes contradict these findings and instead provide evidence that TCoV is closely related to avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Furthermore, experimental studies have indicated that the host range of TCoV, once thought to be restricted to turkeys, includes chickens. These studies have raised additional questions regarding the classification of TCoV; particularly if IBV and TCoV are taxonomically distinct viruses, or if TCoV is simply a variant of IBV. Sequence analyzes of TCoV have given credence to the idea that TCoV is a variant of IBV, as these studies have shown that TCoV and IBV are closely related. However, these studies have been limited to only three TCoV strains and relatively small portions of the TCoV genome. TCoV is easily distinguished from IBV based on antigenic and biological differences, and these differences suggest that TCoV should be considered a distinct virus species. Additional studies will be needed to better define the relationship between TCoV and IBV and to resolve this taxonomic question. Based on our current understanding, it seems prudent to consider TCoV and IBV as distinct virus species that share a close phylogenetic relationship and together comprise group 3 of the major coronavirus antigenic groups.",,"Guy, J.

728,Hemagglutinin structures of H5 avian and H9 swine influenza viruses: possible origin of influenza subtypes,"There are 15 influenza A virus subtypes (H1-H15), all of which are found in avian species. Three have caused pandemics in the past century: H1 in 1918 (and 1977), H2 in 1957, and H3 in 1968. In 1997, an avian H5 virus and in 1999 an H9 virus caused outbreaks of respiratory illness in Hong Kong. We have determined the three-dimensional structures of hemagglutinins (HA) from avian H5 and porcine H9 viruses closely related to viruses isolated from humans in Hong Kong. We have compared them with known structures of H3 HA from the virus that caused the 1968 H3 pandemic and of the HA glycoprotein esterase fusion (HEF) from an influenza C virus. Structure and sequence comparisons suggest that HA subtypes may have originated from the diversification of properties that affected the metastability of HAs necessary for their membrane fusion activities in viral infection.",,"Ha, Y.;Stevens, D.

731,Potential sources and routes of spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 infections in poultry and wild birds in Central Europe in 2007 inferred through probability analyses.,"Recurrent outbreaks of H5N1 HPAIV occurred in several Central European countries in 2007. In-depth phylogenetic analyzes including full genome sequences of the viruses involved were performed to elucidate possible origins of incursions and routes of transmission. Tree reconstructions, as well as inferences of host change and ancestral area, were performed in a maximum likelihood framework. All viruses belonged to a separate subgroup (designated ""EMA-3"") within clade 2.2 and thus were distinct from two lineages of HPAIV H5N1 viruses (designated ""EMA-1"" and ""EMA-2"") present. in the same geographic area in 2006. Analysis of the concatenated coding regions of all eight genome segments significantly improved the resolution and robustness of the reconstructed phylogenies compared to single-gene analyses. At the same time, the methodological limits to retrospectively establishing transmission networks in a comparatively small geographic region and spanning a short period of time became apparent when only few corroborating field epidemiological data were available. Ambiguities remained about the origin of the EMA-3 viruses from a region covering southeastern Germany and the Czech Republic, as well as the routes of spread to other European countries. AIV monitoring programs implemented for wild birds and poultry in these countries did not reveal the presence of these viruses in any of the populations. Host changes between domestic and wild bird populations occurred several times. Analysis of outbreaks in northeastern Germany and near northern Poland in December 2007 showed that the geographical and even temporal proximity of the outbreaks does not necessarily indicate a common source of incursion. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",,"Haase, M.;Starick, E.;Fereidouni, S.;Strebelow, G.;Grund, C.;Seeland, A.;Scheuner, C.;Cieslik, D.;Smietanka, K.;Minta, Z.;Zorman-Rojs, O.;Mojzis, M.;Goletic, T.;Jestin, V.;Schulenburg, B.;Pybus, O.;Mettenleiter, T.;Beer, M.;Harder, T.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2010.07.005,0

This virus, which is serologically distinct from classical DHV (Type I), replicated in duck liver and kidney cell cultures. Replication was limited in cultures of duck embryo and quail and chicken kidney fibroblasts. It did not replicate in a variety of other cell cultures of avian or mammalian origin. The virus was successfully cultured in embryonated duck eggs, but not in chickens. DHV-III passed through a 50 nm membrane filter, was stable at pH 3.0, and resisted treatment with 5% chloroform. Virus growth was not inhibited by treatment with 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine.

734,Metagenomic detection of viruses in aerosol samples from animal slaughterhouse workers,"Published studies have shown that animal slaughterhouse workers have an increased risk of lung cancer compared to the general population. No specific causative agents have been identified, and exposures to various chemicals have been examined and found to be unrelated. Evidence suggests a biological etiology as the risk is greatest for workers who are exposed to live animals or biological material containing animal feces, urine, or blood. To investigate potential biological exposures in animal slaughterhouses, we used a metagenomics approach to characterize the profile of organisms present in an aerosol sample. An assessment of aerosol exposures for individual workers was achieved by collecting personal samples representing the inhalable fraction of dust/bioaerosol in workplace air in cattle and sheep slaughterhouses. Two sets of nine personal spray samples were pooled for cattle and sheep processing areas, respectively, with a total of 332,677,346 sequence reads and 250,144,492 85-bp-long sequence reads produced for each. Eukaryotic genome sequence was found at both sampling locations, and bovine, ovine, and human sequences were common. WU polyomavirus and human papillomavirus 120 sequences were detected in the cattle processing area metagenomic dataset, and these sequences were confirmed to be present in the original personal aerosol samples. This study presents the first metagenomic description of personal aerosol exposure and this methodology could be applied to a variety of settings.

735,Detection of arboviruses and other microorganisms in experimentally infected mosquitoes by massively parallel sequencing,"The incidence of human disease attributed to arbovirus infection is increasing worldwide, with effective control interventions limited by sustainability issues, insecticide resistance, and the lack of effective vaccines. Several promising control strategies are currently being developed, such as the release of mosquitoes transinfected with the virus-blocking bacteria Wolbachia. Implementation of any control program depends on effective virus surveillance and a thorough understanding of virus-vector interactions. Massively parallel sequencing has enormous potential to provide comprehensive genomic information that can be used to assess many aspects of arbovirus ecology, as well as to evaluate new control strategies. To demonstrate proof of principle, we tested Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus experimentally infected with dengue, yellow fever, or chikungunya viruses. Random amplification was used to prepare a sufficient template for sequencing on the Personal Genome Machine. The viral sequences were present in all infected mosquitoes. Furthermore, in most cases, we were also able to identify mosquito species and mosquito microorganisms, including the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia. Importantly, naturally occurring Wolbachia strains could be differentiated from strains that had been transinfected into the mosquito. The method allowed us to assemble almost complete viral genomes and detect other microorganisms without prior knowledge of the sequence, in a single reaction. This is a step towards the application of massively parallel sequencing as a surveillance tool for arboviruses. It has the potential to provide insight into virus transmission dynamics and has applicability for post-release monitoring of Wolbachia in mosquito populations.",,"Hall-Mendelin, S.;Allcock, R.;Kresoje, N.;van den Hurk, A.

However, studies on the eukaryotic component of the gut microbiota have only just begun and have not yet been performed in HIV-infected patients. Furthermore, profiling of the eukaryotic community is influenced by the use of different methodologies at each step of the culture-independent techniques. Here, four DNA extraction protocols were initially compared to test the efficacy of each method in recovering eukaryotic DNA from fecal samples. Our results revealed that the recovery of eukaryotic components from fecal samples differs significantly between DNA extraction methods. Subsequently, the composition of the eukaryotic gut microbiota in HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers was assessed by clone sequencing, high-throughput sequencing of ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and 2 (ITS2) amplicons, and real-time PCR. . Our results revealed that not only richness (Chao-1 index) and alpha diversity (Shannon diversity) differ between HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers, depending on the molecular strategy used, but also the composition of the eukaryotic community. global, with few overlapping taxa. between techniques. In addition, our results based on ITS1/ITS2 meta barcode sequencing and cloning libraries showed significant differences in fungal composition between HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers, but with no distinct groups separating the two groups.

737,Using Bayesian network models to disentangle farm management risk factors for bovine viral diarrhea virus infection,"Understanding the risk factors for transmission of bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) is important for planning national disease control programs. However, traditional statistical approaches may miss important features of BVD epidemiology due to the highly correlated nature of many risk factors at the farm level. In this cross-sectional study, we used data collected from 304 cattle herds in New Zealand during 2015/2016 to compare the results of multivariate logistic regression with Bayesian network (BN) analysis. Blood samples from 15 heifers from each farm were pooled and tested with an antibody ELISA test to classify BVD virus exposure status. Farmers were surveyed about their general management practices, knowledge about BVD and risk factors for disease transmission, including movements on and off the farm, contacts on and between farms, and whether they implemented BVD control measures for their farms. service bulls. Multiple imputation was used to infer missing values in the data set before statistical analysis. The results showed that 57/116 (49.1%) cattle farms and 95/188 (50.5%) dairy farms were likely to be actively infected with BVD virus. Almost 60% of the farms had movements of heifers/cows to the farm and 13.8% of the ranchers reported contact with cattle from other farms. Multivariate logistic regression results showed that farms where heifers/cows had been moved to the facility for all or most of the past five years had a higher risk of being seropositive for BVD than farms without such movements (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.29). â€“4.24). Farms where cattle had occasional or rare contact with cattle from other farms were also at increased risk compared with farms without any contact with animals between farms (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.33 to 5.41), although this association was not dependent on frequency. Only close animal contacts between farms were directly associated with BVD status in the BN model; however, this approach further unraveled other complex associations between correlated management factors and provided important additional insights into the epidemiology of BVD. Compared to other countries with intensive production systems, contact over the fence appears to play a larger role in New Zealand's grazing-based production systems and should be considered when developing strategies for a national pest control program.

The predicted nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared phylogenetically with those of known animal and human enteric caliciviruses. Based on these analyses, 15 BECVs belonged to Norovirus genogroup III and genotype 2 (GIII/2) and were genetically distinct from human Norovirus GI and GII. Six BECVs had capsid gene sequences similar to those of the unclassified Nebraska (NB)-like BECV. All 15 bovine noroviruses (BoNVs) were more closely related to Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK (GIII/2) and other known genotype 2 BoNVs than to genotype 1 Bo/NLV/Jena/80/DE. The BoNV Bo/CV521-OH/02/US showed high nucleotide and amino acid identities (84 and 94%, respectively) with the Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK capsid gene, while the sequences of nucleotides and amino acids of the RNA polymerase gene were more closely related to those of Bo/NLV/Jena/80/DE (77 and 87% identities, respectively) than to those of Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK (69 and 69% of identities, respectively). identities, respectively), suggesting that Bo/CV521-OH/02/US is a genotype 1-2 recombinant.

The technology consists of host nucleic acid removal, random PCR amplification, large-scale sequencing, and bioinformatics. The technology was applied to detect classical swine fever virus (CSFV)-infected cells and a tissue sample from a pig infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). We amplified 13.7% of the CSFV genome sequences and 47.2% of the PCV2 genome sequences, respectively. In addition, we amplified 16.4% of the simian parainfluenza virus type 5 genome sequences from cell culture of unknown viruses using the developed method.

In the late summer of 2006 and 2012, severe outbreaks of pneumonia occurred with mortality rates of 25-30%. During the 2012 epidemic, high-quality samples were obtained from euthanized diseased animals for microbiological and pathological analysis. High-throughput sequencing (pyrosequencing) of pneumonic lung tissue revealed high concentrations of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae in all six animals examined by this method and Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida in four animals, while no virus sequences could be identified. Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae and P. multocida multocida were also isolated by culture. Using real-time PCR on lung smears, M. ovipneumoniae was detected in all 19 pneumonic lungs examined. Gross pathological examination revealed strong consolidations mainly in the cranial parts of the lungs and also identified a case of otitis media. Histologically, the lung lesions were characterized as acute to subacute exudative and moderately proliferative mixed bronchoalveolar pneumonia. Immunohistochemical (IHC) examination revealed a high load of M. ovipneumoniae antigens within the lung lesions, with particularly intense staining in neutrophils. Similar IHC findings were observed in archived lung tissue blocks from animals examined during the 2006 epidemic. An ELISA specific for M. ovipneumoniae was applied to muskox sera from biobanks of stray muskox killed in the period 2004-2013 and slaughtered diseased muskox, as well as serum from wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Dovre and Greenland muskox. A serologic and mycoplasma culture was also performed on sheep that had been grazing in the muskox area during the 2012 outbreak.

743,Porcine epidemic diarrhea in Europe: detailed analyzes of disease dynamics and molecular epidemiology,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease of pigs caused by the virus of the same name (PEDV) belonging to the Alphacoronavirus genus within the Coronaviridae virus family. Following disastrous outbreaks in Asia and the United States, PEDV has also been detected in Europe. To better understand the general situation, the molecular epidemiology and the factors that may influence the impact of the most variable disease; Forty pig faeces samples from different PED outbreaks in Germany and other European countries were collected and sequenced using next-generation sequencing. A total of 38 new complete PEDV coding sequences were generated. When compared on a global scale, all sequences investigated from central and southeastern Europe formed a fairly homogeneous group of PEDV S INDELs, suggesting a recent reintroduction. However, detailed analyzes revealed two new groups and putative ancestor strains. Based on the available history, no correlations between groups and location, farm type, or clinical presentation could be established. Additionally, the impact of secondary infections was explored using the metagenomic datasets. Although several coinfections were observed, no correlation with the course of the disease was found. However, in addition to the PEDV genomes, ten complete viral coding sequences were reconstructed from nine different data sets, each representing new virus strains. In detail, three strains of passivirus A, two astroviruses, one porcine sapelovirus, one kobuvirus, one porcine torovirus, one posavirus, and one enterobacteria phage were almost completely sequenced.",,"Hanke, D.;Pohlmann, A.;Sauter-Louis, C.;HÃ¶per, D.;Stadler, J.;Ritzmann, M.;Steinrigl, A.;Schwarz, B.

744,High diversity of picornaviruses in rats from different continents revealed by deep sequencing,"Outbreaks of zoonotic diseases in humans and livestock are not uncommon, and an important component in containing such emerging viral diseases is rapid and reliable diagnosis. Such methods are often based on PCR and therefore require the availability of pathogen sequence data. Rattus norvegicus (R. norvegicus) is a known reservoir of important zoonotic pathogens. Transmission can be direct through contact with the animal, for example through exposure to its faeces, or indirectly mediated by arthropod vectors. Here we investigate the viral content in rat faeces (n=29) collected from two continents by analyzing 2.2 billion next-generation sequencing reads derived from both DNA and RNA. Among other virus families, we found sequences of Picornaviridae members abundant in the microbiome of all samples. Here we describe the diversity of picornavirus-like contigs, including nearly complete genomes closely related to Boone cardiovirus and Theiler encephalomyelitis virus. From this study, we conclude that picornaviruses within R. norvegicus are more diverse than previously recognized.

745,"Human sapoviruses: genetic diversity, recombination and classification","The family Caliciviridae contains four genera Sapovirus, Norovirus, Lagovirus, and Vesivirus, which include Sapporo virus (SaV), Norwalk virus (NoV), rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), and feline calicivirus (FCV), respectively. . SaV is a causative agent of gastroenteritis in children and adults. SaV can be divided into five genogroups (GI-GV), among which GI, GII, GIV and GV are known to infect humans, while SaV GIII infects porcine species. Detection methods include ELISA, RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR. Since few studies of SaV have been conducted, it is difficult to draw correlations or conclusions on incidence, detection, and overall prevalence rates. However, most studies agree that SaV infection is more common in young children than in adults and that infection in children almost always occurs by age 5 years. In addition, children in daycare centers and institutions are at the greatest risk of SaV-associated infection and transmission. Recently, a number of important findings related to human SaV were discovered. SaV strains were detected in water samples, including untreated sewage samples, treated sewage samples, and river samples. SaV strains have also been detected in samples of shellfish intended for human consumption, and recombinant SaV strains have been identified in several different countries. The purpose of this review was to highlight current knowledge of human SaV, which appears to be an increasingly important virus causing gastroenteritis in humans.

All three viruses share additional similarities in that they have a high percentage of AT content in their genome and are characterized by more compact genomes than other adenoviruses. The protease gene of all three viruses contained the active site residues (H55-D72-C122 triad) and C104 (providing a disulfide bond to cofactor pVIc). However, P137, which is found in all other members of the Mastadenovirus genus and is thought to be involved in trafficking, was missing from the EDS virus protease BAV-7 and OAV287.

DlEPV is introduced into the host of the tephritid fruit fly larva along with the wasp egg at oviposition. We sequenced a shotgun genomic library of DlEPV DNA and analyzed and compared the predicted protein sequences of eight ORFs with those of selected poxviruses and other organisms. BlastP searches showed that five of these are homologous to putative poxvirus proteins, such as metalloprotease, a putative membrane protein, late transcription factor 3, virion surface protein, and regulatory small subunit of poly(A) polymerase (PAP) . Three of them are similar to those of other organisms, such as gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) from Arabidopsis thaliana, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) from Caenorhabditis briggsae, and phage lambda integrase (Î»-Int) from Enterococcus faecium. . Transcriptional motifs for early (TGA,A/T,XXXXA) or late (TAAATG, TAAT, or TAAAT) gene expression conserved in poxviruses were identified with those ORFs. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple alignments of five ORFs and 20 homologous poxvirus sequences and of a concatenation of multiple alignments suggested that DlEPV likely diverged from the ancestral node between fowlpox virus and EPVs of genera B, Lepidoptera and Orthoptera, to which belong Amsacta moorei and Melanoplus sanguinipes. EPV, respectively, belong. Putative DlEPV GGT, eIF4A, and β-Int contained many conserved domains that typified these proteins. These homologues may be involved in viral pathogenicity or enhancement of parasitism through the gamma-glutamyl cycle and compensation of eIF4A levels in the parasitized fly, or through integration of a portion of the viral genome in the wasp and/or wasp. or the parasitized fly. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In other geographic areas, the transmission of this virus is poorly understood. We used large sequence datasets (of the gene encoding viral protein 1, VP1) and a Bayesian phylogenetic approach to compare the molecular epidemiology and geographic spread patterns of EV-B4, B5, C1, C2, and C4 subgenogroups. 71 in Europe relative to other parts of the world. For the study, the European countries considered were the Member States of the European Union (EU) and Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Viruses of subgenogroups B4, B5, and C4 circulate primarily in East and Southeast Asia. Sporadic introductions of these subgenogroups are observed in Europe, however C1 and C2 viruses predominate. Phylogenies showed evidence of multiple C1 and C2 virus spread events within Europe since the mid-1990s. Two waves of sporadic C2 infections also occurred in 2010 and 2013. The 2007 Dutch outbreak caused by C2 and the occurrence of B5 and C4 infections in the EU between 2004 and 2013 occurred when C1 virus circulation was low. A chain of transmission involving a C4 virus was traced from Japan to the EU and then to Canada between 2001 and 2006.

They are believed to be reservoirs and vectors of zoonotic pathogens. However, there is scant reporting of evidence of pathogenic bacteria maintained in bats. Precise knowledge of the pathogenic bacteria in the bat microbiota is important for the control of zoonoses. Therefore, metagenomic analysis targeting the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region of the rectal microbiota in Rousettus amplexicaudatus was performed by high-throughput sequencing. The results revealed that 103 genera of bacteria were detected, including Camplyobacter. Campylobacter was the second predominant genus, and Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni were identified in the microbiome of R. amplexicaudatus. Campylobacteriosis is one of the serious bacterial diarrheas in humans, and the species most frequently implicated as the causative agent of campylobacteriosis is C. jejuni. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of C. jejuni in 91 wild bats using PCR. As a result of the PCR assay targeting the 16S-23S intergenic spacer, a partial C. jejuni genome was detected in only five R. amplexicaudatus. This is the first report of C. jejuni detection in bat rectal swab samples. C. jejuni is the most common cause of campylobacteriosis in humans, transmitted through water and contact with livestock.

ALV is highly pathogenic and induces a wide spectrum of diseases in infected animals. ALV can be divided into five subgroups (AE). The envelope glycoprotein (env gp85) is the major determinant of the antigen and is responsible for subgroup classification.

Subsequently, restriction endonuclease analysis confirmed the identity of the product and discriminated between subgroups. In specific pathogen free (SPF) eggs experimentally inoculated with ALV, viral RNA was found in allantoic fluids, as well as in vaccines spiked with different ALV subgroups. No adventitious virus was detected in commercially available preparations.

In the US, only bovine rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) has been identified, while bovine rhinitis A virus 2 (BRAV2) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) have only been identified previously in England and Japan, respectively. Metagenomic sequencing of a nasal swab from a Kansas bovine respiratory disease (BRD) diagnostic submission identified contigs with approximately 90% nucleotide similarity to BRAV2 and BRBV. A combination of de novo and templated assemblies using reference genomes produced nearly complete BRAV2 and BRBV genomes. The near complete genome of bovine rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) was also determined from a historical isolate to allow further molecular epidemiological studies. A 3D polymerase gene-targeted 5'-nuclease reverse transcription PCR assay was designed and used to screen 204 archived BRD clinical samples. Thirteen (6.4%) were positive. Metagenomic sequencing of six positive samples identified mixed BRAV1/BRAV2, BRAV1/BRBV, and BRAV2/BRBV infections in five samples. One sample showed infection only with BRAV1. Seroprevalence studies using an adapted BRBV cell culture found that antibodies reactive to the immunofluorescence assay were common in the herds tested. Taken together, these results demonstrate that BRV infections are common in cattle with respiratory disease and that BRAV1, BRAV2, and BRBV co-circulate in US cattle and are highly similar to viruses isolated more than 30 years ago from various locations.",,"Hause, B.

758,Characterization of a new influenza virus in cattle and pigs: proposal of a new genus in the family Orthomyxoviridae,"We recently reported the isolation of a new virus, provisionally designated C/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK), with 50% overall homology to human influenza C viruses (ICVs), from a pig in Oklahoma. Deep sequencing of C/OK virus RNA found a matrix protein 1 (M1) expression strategy that differed from that of ICV. The novelty of the C/OK virus prompted us to investigate whether the C/OK virus could exist in a non-porcine species. Significantly, we found that C/OK virus was widespread in US cattle herds, as demonstrated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and serological assays. Genome sequencing of three bovine viruses isolated from two herds in different states further confirmed these findings. To determine whether porcine/bovine C/OK viruses can reassort with human ICVs, and clarify the taxonomic status of C/OK, in vitro reassortments and serological typing by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were performed. In vitro reassortment using two human ICVs and two porcine and bovine C/OK viruses demonstrated that the human ICV and C/OK viruses were unable to reassort and produce viable progeny. Antigenically, no cross-recognition of detergent-cleaved virions in AGID was observed between human and non-human viruses using polyclonal antibodies that were reactive with related antigens. Taken together, these results demonstrate that C/OK virus is genetically and antigenically distinct from ICV. Classification of the new virus in a separate genus of the family Orthomyxoviridae is proposed. The finding of C/OK virus in pigs and cattle indicates that this new virus can spread and establish infection in other mammals, including humans. © 2014 Hause et al.",,"Hause, B. M.;Collin, E.

763,The virome of feral pigs is dominated by single-stranded DNA viruses and contains a new Orthopneumovirus that circulates in both feral and domestic pigs.,"Feral pigs are known reservoirs for several pathogens that can adversely affect domestic animals. To assess the viral ecology of feral pigs in the US, metagenomic sequencing was performed on 100 pooled nasal swabs. The virome was dominated by small ssDNA viruses belonging to the Circoviridae, Anelloviridae, and Parvovirinae families. Only four RNA viruses were identified: porcine kobuvirus, porcine sapelovirus, atypical porcine pestivirus, and a new orthopneumovirus, provisionally named porcine orthopneumovirus (SOV). SOV shared ~90% nucleotide identity with murine pneumonia virus (MPV) and canine pneumovirus. A commercially available ELISA modified for MPV found that approximately 30% of sera from wild and domestic pigs were positive for MPV cross-reactive antibodies. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR identified two (2%) and four (5.0%) pools of positive nasal swabs from feral and domestic pigs, respectively, confirming that SOV circulates in both herds.",,"Hause, B.

Eighteen posavirus genomes were assembled from 10 of 25 (40%) pools of fecal swabs collected from healthy adult pigs. Phylogenetic analysis of the conserved domain of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) found that posaviruses form a large and highly diverse monophyletic clade, including similar viruses identified in feces or intestinal contents of humans (husaviruses) and fish (physaviruses), respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis of water samples collected from commercial pig barns identified that four of 19 (21%) samples were positive by a 5-nuclease assay targeting the Pol region of posavirus 1. detection by PCR) to explore serological evidence of posavirus infection found only one positive sample, suggesting that posaviruses do not commonly infect pigs, and taken together, these results suggest a likely aquatic host.",,"Hause, B.

766,The Pseudocowpoxvirus Genome: Comparison of a Reindeer Isolate and a Reference Strain,"Parapoxviruses (PPV), of the Poxviridae family, cause a pustular skin disease in sheep and goats (orf virus, ORFV) and cattle (pseudocowpoxvirus, PCPV, and bovine papular stomatitis virus, BPSV). Here we present the first genomic sequence of a PCPV reference strain (VR634) together with the genomic sequence of a PPV (F00.120R) isolated in Finland from reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus). The F00.120R and VR634 genomes are 135 and 145 kb in length and contain 131 and 134 putative genes, respectively, and their genomic organization is similar to that of other PPVs. The predicted proteins of F00.120R and VR634 have an average amino acid sequence identity of more than 95%, while sharing only 88 and 73% amino acid identity with the ORFV and BPSV proteomes, respectively. The most notable differences were found near the ends of the genome. F00.120R lacks six and VR634 lacks three genes seen near the right terminus of other PPVs. Four genes at the far left of F00.120R and one in the middle of both genomes appear to be fragmentary paralogs of other genes within the genome. VR634 has larger than expected terminal inverted repeats, possibly as a result of genomic rearrangements. The high G+C content (64%) of these two viruses along with amino acid sequence comparisons and genome-wide phylogenetic analyzes confirm the classification of PCPV as a separate species within the genus Parapoxvirus and verify that the virus responsible for an outbreak of contagious stomatitis in reindeer during the winter of 1999-2000 can be classified as PCPV. © 2010 SGM.",,"Hautaniemi, M.;Ueda, N.;Tuimala, J.;Mercer, A.

767,History of prions and transmission of protein misfolding,"Given that J. Cuillé and PL Chelle successfully transmitted scrapie between sheep by experimental inoculation in 1936 and DC Gajdusek kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to chimpanzees in 1966 and 1968, respectively, the nature of the agents causing these ""diseases of slow viruses"" remains a mystery. In 1982, S. Prusiner named them ""PRIONS"" (for ""INfectious PROteinaceous particles"") because they appeared to be devoid of the nucleic acids that would classify them as viruses. Although infectious or genetic mechanisms were rarely found, most of the rare human PRION diseases appeared ""sporadically"". They shared many clinical and neuropathological properties with human neurodegenerative diseases (slow growth, significant nervous system involvement, amyloid deposits, poor immune response) whose mechanism was not usually considered infectious. In 1991, H. Braak showed, in the brain of Alzheimer's disease, the low spread of tau-associated neuropathological lesions along anatomical pathways. They appear long before the clinical signs. The abnormally misfolded proteins characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases are thought to aggregate after an initial seeding. This leads to its cell-cell transmission and dissemination through neuronal and extraneuronal pathways, the unexpected extent of which is under study. Whether the seed is infectious or not is still being debated. This new paradigm to understand its natural history and phenotypic diversity, which has already led to evaluating the diagnostic value of skin biopsy, should open the door to a new therapeutic approach.",,"Hauw, J.

768,Evidence for microevolution of Salmonella Typhimurium during a series of egg-associated outbreaks linked to a single chicken farm,"BACKGROUND: The bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is one of the most frequent causes of outbreaks of foodborne gastroenteritis. Between 2005 and 2008, a series of outbreaks of S. Typhimurium occurred in Tasmania, Australia, traced back to eggs originating from a single chicken farm. We sequenced the genomes of 12 isolates linked to these outbreaks to investigate the microevolution of a pathogenic clone of S. Typhimurium in a spatiotemporally restricted natural population. RESULTS: The isolates, which shared a DT135-like phage type known locally as 135@ or 135a, formed a clade within the S. Typhimurium population with high similarity to the reference genome SL1334 (160 single nucleotide polymorphisms , or SNP). Ten of the isolates belonged to a single clone (<23 SNPs between pairs of isolates) that probably represents the population of S. Typhimurium circulating in the chicken farm; the other two were from sporadic cases and were genetically distinct from this clone. Divergence dating indicated that the 12 isolates diverged from a common ancestor in the mid-1990s, and the clone began to diversify in 2003-2004. This clone spilled into the human population several times between 2005 and 2008, during which time it continued to accumulate SNPs at a constant rate of 3-5 SNPs per year or 1x10-6 substitutions site-1 year-1, faster than the older clone. long. Forward rates (~50 years) previously estimated for S. Typhimurium. Our data suggest that approximately half of the non-synonymous substitutions are rapidly eliminated from the S. Typhimurium population, after which purifying selection is no longer important and the remaining substitutions become fixed in the population. Isolates of S. Typhimurium 135@ were nearly identical to SL1344 in terms of virulence gene and plasmid content. Their phage content was close to SL1344, except that they carried a different variant of Gifsy-1, lacked the P2 remnant found in SL1344, and carried a new P2 phage, P2-Hawk, instead of the P2 SopEphi phage of SL1344. DT135 lacks a P2 prophage. Two additional plasmids were identified in the S. Typhimurium 135@ isolates, pSTM2 and pSTM7. Both plasmids were IncI1, but phylogenetic analysis of the plasmids and their bacterial hosts shows that these plasmids are genetically distinct and result from independent plasmid acquisition events. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a high-resolution view of the short-term microevolution of the important human pathogen S. Typhimurium. It indicates that purifying selection occurs rapidly in this population (<= 6 years) and then declines, and provides an estimate of the short-term replacement rate. The latter is likely to be more relevant to foodborne outbreak investigation than earlier estimates based on longer time scales.",,"Hawkey, J.;Edwards, D.

769,"Diversity in VP3, NSP3 and NSP4 of rotavirus B detected in Japanese cattle","Bovine rotavirus B (RVB) is an aetiological agent of diarrhea mainly in adult cattle. Currently, some sequences of viral protein (VP) 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 and nonstructural protein (NSP) 1, 2 and 5 of bovine RVB are available in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases, and none have reported for VP3, NSP3 and NSP4. To fill this gap in the genetic characterization of bovine RVB strains, we used a metagenomic approach and sequenced and analyzed the full coding sequences (CDS) of the VP3, NSP3, and NSP4 genes, as well as partial or full CDS of other genes. . RVB genes detected in Japanese cattle. Bovine RVB VP3, NSP3, and NSP4 shared low nucleotide sequence identities (63.3-64.9% for VP3, 65.9-68.2% for NSP3, and 52.6-56.2% for NSP4) with those of murine, human, and porcine RVB, suggesting that bovine RVB belong to a new genotype. In addition, significantly low amino acid sequence identities for NSP4 (36.1-39.3%) were observed between bovine RVBs and RVBs from other species. In contrast, hydrophobic plot analysis of NSP4 revealed profiles similar to those of RVB from other rotavirus A (RVA) species and strains. Phylogenetic analyzes of all gene segments revealed that bovine RVB strains formed a group that branched distantly from other RVB. These results suggest that bovine RVBs have evolved independently of other RVBs but similarly to other rotaviruses. These findings provide insight into the evolution and diversity of RVB strains.",,"Hayashi-Miyamoto, M.;Murakami, T.;Minami-Fukuda, F.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Kishimoto, M.;Sano, K.;Naoi, Y.;Asano, K.;Ichimaru, T.;Haga, K.;Omatsu, T.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Aoki, H.;Shirai, J.;Ishida, M.;Katayama, K.;Mizutani, T.;Nagai, M.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2017.01.003,1

771,Analysis of peptide motifs of the third variable region of subtype B of HIV-1 for the induction of neutralizing antibodies against primary isolates of HIV-1,"The gp120 V3 loop of HIV-1 is a potent inducer of neutralizing antibodies for the HIV-1-adapted T-cell line, but less so for primary isolates. We hypothesize that peptides representative of the diversity of natural variants of the HIV-1 V3 loop could capture elements of conserved higher-order structures and thus stimulate broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies. We designed a panel of 29 postulated subtype B V3 sequences to reflect the range of diversity of V3. These peptides were used to immunize guinea pigs. The most effective peptide (62.19) clustered around the subtype B consensus sequence and induced antibodies that reproducibly neutralized 31% of primary HIV-1 subtype B isolates tested, but showed limited cross-neutralization of antibodies. HIV-1 strains that are not subtype B. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the limited neutralization profile of antibodies induced by the optimal subtype B V3 motifs likely represents the maximum neutralization breadth of primary isolates of subtype B.

772,"Group A Rotaviruses in Chinese Bats: Genetic Composition, Serology, and Evidence for Transmission and Redistribution from Bats to Humans","Bats are natural reservoirs for many pathogenic viruses, and mounting evidence supports the idea that bats may also harbor rotavirus group A (RVA), important agents of diarrhea in children and young animals. Currently, 8 RVA strains have been identified in African and Chinese bats that possess entirely new constellations of genotypes or genotypes possibly originating from other mammals. However, all data were primarily based on the detection of RVA RNA, present only during acute infections, which does not allow the true exposure of a bat population to RVA to be assessed. To systematically investigate the genetic diversity of RVAs, 547 bat anal swabs or intestinal samples were collected along with 448 bat sera from five provinces in southern China. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) specific screening found four RVA strains. The GLRL1 strain possessed an entirely new constellation of genotypes, while the other three possessed a constellation consistent with the genotype similar to MSLH14, a newly characterized group of viruses that is widely prevalent in Chinese insectivorous bats. Among the latter, strain LZHP2 provided strong evidence for interspecies transmission of RVA from bats to humans, while strains YSSK5 and BSTM70 were likely reassignments between typical MSLH14-type RVAs and human RVAs. RVA-specific antibodies were detected in 10.7% (48/448) of bat sera by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). Bats from Guangxi and Yunnan had higher RVA-specific antibody prevalence than those from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. These observations provide evidence for interspecies transmission of RVA from MSLH14-like bats to humans, highlighting the impact of bats as reservoirs of RVA on public health. SIGNIFICANCE Bat viruses, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses, are important pathogens causing outbreaks of serious emerging infectious diseases. However, little is known about bat viruses capable of causing gastroenteritis in humans, despite the fact that 8 group A viruses (AVR) have been identified in bats so far. In this study, 4 other RVA strains were identified, one of which provided strong evidence for zoonotic transmission from bats to humans. Serological research has also indicated that RVA infection in bats is much more common than expected based on detection of viral RNA.",,"He, B.;Huang, X. H.;Zhang, F. Q.;Tan, W.

774,Characterization of a new G3P[3] rotavirus isolated from a lesser horseshoe bat: a distant relative of feline/canine rotaviruses,"Bats are considered important animal reservoirs for many pathogenic viruses for humans. A viral metagenomics-based approach was used to study intestinal samples from 78 insectivorous bats in Yunnan Province, China. Seventy-four reads were found to be related to rotavirus group A (RVA). Additional reverse transcription-PCR detection and viral isolation in cell cultures confirmed the presence of a new RVA strain, named RVA/Bat-tc/MSLH14/2012/G3P[3], in 1 (6%) of 16 bats minor horseshoe. Whole genome sequencing analyzes showed that MSLH14 possessed the genotype constellation G3-P[3]-I8-R3-C3-M3-A9-N3-T3-E3-H6, which is similar to human and animal rotaviruses found in believed to be feline/canine in origin. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that VP7 was most closely related to bovine strains of RVA from India, while VP4 was most closely related to an unusual human strain of RVA, CMH222, with animal characteristics isolated in Thailand. The remaining gene segments were only distantly related to a variety of animal RVA strains, most of which are believed to be related to feline/canine RVA. Experimental infection showed that the bat RVA strain MSLH14 was highly pathogenic for suckling mice, causing 100% mortality when inoculated orally at as low a titer as 5 × 102 50% infective doses in tissue culture. . As this virus is not closely related to any known RVA strain, it is tempting to speculate that it is a true bat RVA strain rather than a cross-species transmitted virus. However, additional detection of bat populations, preferably young animals, will be crucial in determining whether this virus is widely distributed in the bat population.",,"He, B.;Yang, F.;Yang, W.;Zhang, Y.;Feng, Y.;Zhou, J.;Xie, J.;Feng, Y.;Bao, X.;Guo, H.;Li, Y.;Xia, L.;Li, N.;Matthijnssens, J.;Zhang, H.;Tu, C.",2013.0,,10.1128/jvi.02013-13,0
775,Genome-wide mapping of DNase I hypersensitive sites and association analysis with gene expression in MSB1 cells,"DNase I hypersensitive (DHS) sites mark various classes of cis-regulatory regions, such as promoters and enhancers. MSB-1 derived from chicken Marek's disease (MD) lymphomas is an MDV-transformed CD4+ T-cell line for the study of MD. Previously, DNase IHS sites were studied mainly in mammalian human cell types. To capture MSB1 cell-specific regulatory elements and explore the molecular mechanisms of MDV-caused T cell transformation into MD, we generated a high-quality DHS map and gene expression profile for functional analysis in the MSB1 cell line. . A total of 21,724 significant DHS peaks were identified from around 40 million short reads. The distribution of DHSs varied between chromosomes and they preferred to be enriched on gene-rich chromosomes. More interesting, DHS enrichments appeared to be low in the CpG-island abundant regions. Furthermore, we integrated DHSs into gene expression data and found that DHSs tended to be enriched for high-expressing genes over entire gene regions, whereas DHSs did not show significant changes for low-expressing and silent genes. Furthermore, the correlation of DHS with lincRNA expression was also calculated and implied that enhancer-associated lincRNAs likely originated from enhancer-like regions of DHS. Together, our results indicated that DNase I HS sites correlate highly with the expression of active genes in MSB1 cells, suggesting that DHS can be considered markers to identify cis-regulatory elements associated with chicken Marek's disease. © 2014 He, Carrillo, Luo, Ding, Tian and Song.",,"He, Y.;Carrillo, J.

776,"Whole genome sequencing of Newcastle disease virus genotype VI from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of wild pigeons reveals ongoing evolution and previously unrecognized genetic diversity in the US.","Background: Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) are highly contagious and cause disease in both wild birds and poultry. A pigeon-adapted genotype VI NDV variant, often referred to as pigeon paramyxovirus 1, is commonly isolated from pigeons in the United States and worldwide. Complete genomic characterization of these genotype VI viruses circulating in wild pigeons in the United States is limited, and because of the genetic variability of the virus, rapid diagnostic screening has been reported to have failed. Therefore, in this study, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify and characterize these circulating viruses, providing valuable genetic information. NGS allows deep sequencing of multiple samples in parallel. When used on FFPE samples, this methodology allows for retrospective studies of infectious organisms. Methods: Wild pigeon FFPE tissue samples (kidney, liver, and spleen) from 10 mortality events in the US between 2010 and 2016 were analyzed using NGS to detect and sequence NDV genomes from randomly amplified total RNA. Results were compared with previously published immunohistochemistry (IHC) results performed on the same samples. In addition, phylogenetic analyzes were performed on the full and partial fusion gene and coding sequences of the entire genome. Results: Twenty-three of 29 samples from IHC-positive FFPE pigeons were identified as positive for NDV by NGS. Positive samples produced an average genomic coverage of 99.6% and an average median depth of 199. A previously described subgenotype (VIa) and a new subgenotype (VIn) of NDV were identified as the causative agent of 10 pigeon mortality events. in the US from 2010 to 2016. The distribution of these viruses from North American lineages is consistent with the distribution of collared turtle doves and Eurasian rock pigeons in the US. Conclusions: This paper reports the first evolutionary study successful using deep genome sequencing FFPE samples from wild birds. There are at least two distinct lineages in the US of genotype VI NDV maintained in wild pigeons that are continually evolving independently and have no obvious epidemiologic connections to viruses circulating abroad. These findings support the hypothesis that pigeons serve as reservoirs for virulent NDV in the US.",,"He, Y.;Taylor, T. L.;Dimitrov, K. M.;Butt, S. L.;Stanton, J. B.;Goraichuk, I.

777,Electrostatic hemagglutinin variation as a hallmark of avian influenza virus evolution,"The avian influenza virus is a zoonotic agent that significantly affects public health and the poultry industry. Monitoring the evolution and spread of the virus is essential for surveillance and tracking programs, which are currently based on serological or phylogenetic DNA sequencing analysis. However, virus-host interactions, antigenic drift, and the spread of viral clades are highly dependent on variation in the surface characteristics of capsid proteins. We report here that in silico comparative structural analysis of hemagglutinin can reveal relevant evolutionary fingerprints, particularly when integrated with sequence-based analyses. Phylogenetic analyzes of H9 viral strains from wild birds and poultry, performed with different methods, reliably led to the grouping of viruses into five main groups. Subsequent comparison of structural features showed congruence between such clustering and surface electrostatic fingerprints. These latter fingerprints relate group-specific variations in electrostatic charges and isocontours to well-known hemagglutinin sites involved in the modulation of immune escape and host specificity. This work suggests that the integration of structural and sequence comparisons can improve investigations of relevant trends and mechanisms in viral evolution.",,"Heidari, A.;Righetto, I.;Filippini, F.",2018.0,,10.1038/s41598-018-20225-3,0

Background The MChip uses data from hybridization of amplified viral RNA with 15 different oligonucleotides that target the influenza A matrix (M) gene segment. An artificial neural network (ANN) automates the interpretation of subtle differences in patterns fluorescence intensity of the microarray. The entire process, from clinical specimen to identification, including viral RNA amplification, can be completed in <8 hours for less than US$10. Objectives The work presented here represents an effort to expand and test the capabilities of the MChip to differentiate influenza A/H1N1 from various species of origin. Methods The ANN MChip was trained to recognize fluorescence imaging patterns of a variety of known influenza A viruses, including examples of human H1N1, human H3N2, porcine H1N1, pandemic 2009 influenza A H1N1, and a wide variety of avian, equine , canine and swine influenza viruses. The robustness of MChip ANN was assessed using 296 blinded isolates. Results ANN training was expanded by the addition of 71 well-characterized influenza A isolates and yielded relatively high accuracy (small misclassification) in distinguishing unique H1N1 strains: nine human A/H1N1 (88 9% correct), 35 human A/H1N1 H3N2 (97 1% correct), 31 North American swine A/H1N1 (80 6% correct), 14 pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 (87 7% correct), and 23 negative samples (91 3% correct). Genetic diversity among swine H1N1 isolates may have contributed to the lower success rate of these viruses.

Methods. The full length of the known variable protein ÏƒC and part of the genes encoding ÏƒB were amplified with RT-PCR, using conserved primers. The PCR products were sequenced and the sequences analyzed and aligned with avian reovirus sequences from the Genbank database. Results: The sequences of the genes encoding ÏƒC of all the isolated strains indicated their close relationship with the American, Chinese and Indian strains. Taking as reference the American strain S1133, the two Tunisian isolates 97.1 and 97.2 showed some nucleotide substitutions. For isolate 97.1, the substitution was silent while for strain 97.2 the mutation was in the first position of the corresponding codon and induced the substitution of the encoded amino acid. For the gene encoding ÏƒB, the sequences of the Tunisian strains showed mutations at positions two or three of the corresponding codons, inducing amino acid substitutions at these positions. Phylogenetic trees based on the genes encoding ÏƒC and ÏƒB indicated a closer relationship between Tunisian, US, and Taiwanese isolates of genotype I. Conclusion: Our study describes the genotype of avian reoviruses that are not yet well characterized genetically. The characterization and classification of these viruses could be important to understand the epidemiology of malabsorption syndrome and viral arthritis, and improve our knowledge of the genotype of the strains circulating in Tunisian flocks. In addition, the study of its variable pathogenicity could be of great importance in choosing the appropriate vaccine strain to control the disease. © 2013 Hellal Kort et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Hellal Kort, Y.;BourogÃ¢a, H.;Gribaa, L.;Scott-Algara, D.;Ghram, A.",2013.0,,10.1186/1743-422x-10-12,0

781,Emergence of a new strain of foot-and-mouth disease virus type O: Its phylogenetic and evolutionary relationship with the panAsia pandemic strain,"In India, serotype O of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) has been associated with more than 75% of outbreaks. Previous studies with this serotype have indicated that the viruses circulating in India belong to a single genotype. Recent FMD epidemics in Europe (February 2001) have focused world attention on the source of the virus and have been traced to a strain, PanAsia (serotype O), which has been present in India since 1990. In this study, To better characterize isolates belonging to the PanAsian strain, we sequenced the entire VP1-encoding gene (1D) for 71 isolates of serotype O FMD virus from India recovered from field outbreaks during the last 4 decades (1962- 2001). All isolates in the tree were distributed in three main branches (designated as A, B and C); branch C is further divided into four groups (I-IV), of which group IV belongs to the PanAsia strain. Furthermore, we show that the PanAsia strain has been circulating endemically since 1982 (not since 1990 as previously reported) and has been the most dominant outbreak strain in recent years and distributed in at least 17 states in the country. During 2001, another new group (group III) of viruses with 5.4-11.1% genetic divergence at the nucleotide level from the PanAsia strain was found to be circulating endemically and slowly replacing it. At the amino acid level, this strain differed from the PanAsia strain at five amino acid positions in VP1. Although these strains are divergent at the nucleotide level, they maintained a good antigenic relationship with one of the vaccine strains (IND R2/75) widely used in the country. Given the ability of the PanAsia virus to persist, spread and outcompete other strains, the current trend could be of great concern as the emerging virus is replacing it. If this is true, then there is another equally divergent strain like PanAsia that may pose a serious threat to the global meat and dairy industries.",,"Hemadri, D.;Tosh, C.;Sanyal, A.;Venkataramanan, R.",2002.0,,10.1023/a:1020165923805,0
782,Genetic analysis of FMDV type O isolates responsible for field outbreaks in India between 1993 and 1999.,"The partial nucleotide sequence at the 3” end of the 1D gene (coding for VP1) was determined from 90 isolates of FMD virus type O recovered from field outbreaks in India between 1993 and 1999. The sequences were compared with each other and with reference virus. Published sequences of 15 O-type isolates recovered from different parts of Asia and one isolate (O1BFS) from Europe and one from Egypt (O1/Sharquia/Egypt/72) were also included in the analysis for comparison. Based on phylogenetic analysis, viruses could be grouped into four distinct genotypes (genotypes I-IV). All 90 isolates from India were genotype I, as were reference isolates from Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Turkey. Genotype I isolates were subdivided into 16 subgenotypes. The Indian isolates were found to be extremely heterogeneous in nature and clustered into 12 different genetic pools. In genotype I, the observed nucleotide sequence difference between isolates was 0-11.6%, while between Indian isolates it is 0-8.8%. Viruses of similar genetic pools are circulating in India, Bangladesh, and countries in the Middle East. Genotypes II and III are represented by isolates from Lebanon (O1/South Lebanon) and Europe (O1-BFS), respectively. Genotype IV is made up of isolates from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The present study reveals the appearance of viruses belonging to multiple genetic groups during a short period of time and the persistence of a single genetic group in the same geographic area for several years. This is consistent with the endemic nature of the disease in the country.",,"Hemadri, D.;Tosh, C.;Venkataramanan, R.;Sanyal, A.;Samuel, A. R.;Knowles, N. J.;Kitching, R.

Viral growth curves revealed that >99% of the infectious SLE virus (Paton) remained cell-associated in Vero cells but was slowly released into the medium of infected BHK-21 cells. In contrast, RB virus (M-64) was released upon maturation in Vero and BHK-21 cell culture fluids. Forty times more SLE virus than RB virus adsorbed on monolayer cultures of Aedes dorsalis cells. The SLE but not RB virus replicated and reached high titers (108 pfu/ml) in Ae. dorsalis cell cultures maintained in media that were expected to enhance recovery of RB virus. Furthermore, SLE but not RB virus replicated in cultured bat epithelial cells and in primary duck embryo cells incubated at 42°C.

785,Human biliary glycoproteins function as receptors for interspecies transfer of hepatitis virus in mice,"variant of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), designated MHV-H2, was isolated by serial passage in mixed cultures of permissive DBT cells and non-permissive Syrian hamster kidney (BHK) cells. MHV-H2 replicated efficiently in hamster, mouse, primate kidney (Vero, Cos 1, Cos 7), and human adenocarcinoma (HRT) cell lines, but did not replicate in porcine testis (ST), feline kidney (CRFK ) and canine kidney (MDCK cells). To understand the molecular basis of cross-species transfer of coronaviruses to human cell lines, we studied MHV-H2 replication in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells expressing high levels of the human homologue of the normal murine receptor, biliary glycoprotein (Bgp). ) . MHV-H2 replicated efficiently in human HepG2 cells, at low levels in breast carcinoma cells (MCF7), and poorly, if at all, in human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (LS 174T) expressing high levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). These data suggested that MHV-H2 may use the human Bgp homologue as a receptor to enter HepG2 cells. To further study the use of the MHV-H2 receptor in human cell lines, blocking experiments were performed with a panel of different monoclonal or polyclonal antisera directed against human CEA genes. Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with a polyclonal antiserum directed against all members of the CEA family, or with a monoclonal antibody, Kat4c (cd66abde), directed against Bgp1, CGM6, CGM1a, NCA, and CEA, significantly reduced virus replication and ability of MHV-H2 to infect HepG2 cells. The use of another panel of monoclonals with more restricted cross-reactivities between human CEAs, Col-4 and Col-14, but not B6.2, B1.13, Col-1, Col-6 and Col-12 blocked infection by MHV-H2 in HepG2 cells. These antibodies did not block sindbis virus (SB) replication in HepG2 cells, nor did they block SB, MHV-A59, or MHV-H2 replication in DBT cells. Monoclonal antibodies Col-4, Col-14, and Kat4c (cd66abde) reacted strongly with human Bgp and CEA, but showed variable binding patterns with other CEA genes. Following expression of human Bgp in normally non-permissive porcine testicular (ST) and feline kidney (KRF) cells, the cells became susceptible to MHV-H2 infection. These data suggested that phylogenetic homologues of virus receptors represent natural conduits for virus xenotropism and interspecies transfer.",,"Hensley, L. E.;Baric, R. S.",1998.0,,,0
786,"Metagenomic identification, seasonal dynamics and possible transmission mechanisms of a Daphnia-associated single-stranded DNA virus in two temperate lakes","We use a metagenomic approach to identify viruses that may be involved in the ecology of Daphnia spp. in Oneida and Cayuga Lakes (New York State). We identified several highly represented putative eukaryotic, single-stranded, circular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viral genomes. Among these, we discovered a genotype similar in both sequence and genomic architecture to a previously reported hyperthermal lake virus that shares characteristics of both single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) and single-stranded DNA viruses. We used quantitative polymerase chain reactions to study the prevalence and viral load of positive and negative sense strains of hybrid virus (DMClaHV) associated with Daphnia mendotae (Cladocera) during a summer season in Oneida and Cayuga Lakes. DMClaHV had a high prevalence within Daphnia populations, where viral load and the proportion of virus-positive individuals were highest before host population decline. DMClaHV viral load was different between two Daphnia species (D. mendotae and D. retrocurva), and the dynamics between viruses and their hosts varied between the two lakes. We detected DMClaHV in eggs (ephipia) recovered from Oneida Lake sediments with an estimated age of 30 years. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observed small (20 nm diameter) virus-like particles in Daphnia that were well removed from gut tissues and not associated with intracellular parasites. Because Daphnia play a critical role in many lake ecosystems, DMClaHV can have important effects on herbivory and thus carbon flux through the lake ecosystem.",,"Hewson, I.;Ng, G.;Li, W.

787,Application of High Resolution Melting Curve Analysis for Infectious Bronchitis Virus Classification in Field Samples,"Objective: A high-resolution melting curve (HRM)/real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis protocol was developed in our laboratory to differentiate reference strains of infectious bronchitis (IB) virus. In the current study, this method was used to detect and classify IB viruses in field presentations. Procedure: Over a period of 11 months, samples were received from 40 suspected IB virus cases and 17 shipments tested positive for IB virus by polymerase chain reaction. HRM curve analysis classified each strain as a subgroup 1, 2, or 3 strain (12 presentations) or a strain that could not be classified (5 presentations). Nucleotide sequences of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) and partial S1 gene for the 17 IB virus strains were determined and their identity was compared with that of the relative reference strains to confirm the rankings generated by analysis of the HRM curve. Results: Of the 12 field IB viruses classified as subgroup 1, 2, or 3 by HRM curve analysis, the 3'UTR and S1 gene nucleotide sequences had ≥99% identities with the reference strain of the respective subgroup. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the 3'UTR and the S1 gene for the five BI virus strains that could not be classified indicated that four belonged to one of the subgroups and one was a potentially recombinant strain (among the strains of subgroups 2 and 3). A new recombinant strain was also detected. Conclusion: HRM curve analysis can quickly assign most IB viruses present in field presentations to known subgroups. Importantly, HRM curve analysis also identified variant genotypes that require further investigation. © 2010 The authors.

It possesses a tripartite single-stranded RNA genome of negative polarity consisting of large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segments. The CCHF virus is enzootic in livestock and wildlife in many parts of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa, and is also recognized in southeastern Europe. Severe disease, manifesting as hemorrhagic fever and high mortality rates (up to 50%), is only recognized in humans. We have determined the complete sequence of the small genomic RNA segment of several CCHF virus strains from outbreaks in Pakistan 2000, Baghdad 1976, and Uzbekistan 1967. Phylogenetic analysis of three available small genomic RNA segment sequence datasets from a variety of strains indicates that they can be divided into seven subtypes. Superimposed on this pattern are links between distant geographic locations, pointing to the existence of a global reservoir of CCHFv. In some cases, these links may originate from the livestock trade and the long-distance transport of viruses or infected ticks during bird migration. © 2004 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Hewson, R.;Chamberlain, J.;Mioulet, V.;Lloyd, G.;Jamil, B.;Hasan, R.;Gmyl, A.;Gmyl, L.;Smirnova, S.

Phylogenetic comparisons of these strains, known as T1, T3, T5, T6, and T7, and related sequences showed that these strains are, in fact, PStV strains. Furthermore, PStV strains appear to be related to each other based on their geographic origin. That is, the Thai strains are more closely related to each other than to the US or Indonesian strains, despite the variety of symptoms caused by these strains and the overlapping of symptom types between strains from different locations. Like other PStV strains, PStV-Thai can be considered bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) strains, but can be distinguished from BCMV strains that infect beans and cowpea peek mosaic virus (B1CMV). across sequence and host range. No evidence was found that PStV-Thai strains, unlike PStV-Ib, are recombinants of PStV and B1CMV, although strain T3 may be a recombinant of different PStV sequences.

791,High-throughput sequencing methods for microbiome profiling: Application to animal feeding systems Review,"Analysis of microbial communities using high-throughput sequencing methods began in the mid-2000s, allowing the production of thousands to tens of thousands of sequence reads per sample and megadatabases per sequence run. This unprecedented sequencing depth enabled, for the first time, the discovery of the 'rare biosphere' in environmental samples. The technology was quickly applied to studies in various human subjects. Perhaps these early studies served as a reminder that although mammalian-dwelling microbes are known to outnumber host cells by an order of magnitude or more, most of these are unknown members of our second genome, or microbiome (as coined by Joshua Lederberg), due to our inability to culture them. High-throughput methods for the microbial 16S ribosomal RNA gene and whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) have now begun to reveal the composition and identity of archaeological, bacterial, and viral communities at many sites, within and on the body. Surveys of the microbiota of food-producing animals have been published in recent years, and future studies should benefit from protocols and tools developed from large-scale human microbiome studies. However, resources related to animal production, such as improved host genome assemblies and a greater number and diversity of host-specific microbial reference genome sequences, will be needed to enable meaningful and robust analysis of WGS sequence data and 16S rDNA.",,"Highlander, S.

792,Influenza transmission reflects the seasonality of wild birds throughout the annual cycle,"Influenza A viruses (IAV) in nature must overcome changing transmission barriers caused by the mobility of their main host, wild migratory birds, which changes throughout the annual cycle. Using a phylogenetic network of viral sequences from North American wild birds (2008-2011), we demonstrate a shift from intraspecific to interspecific transmission that, together with rearrangement, allows IAV to achieve viral flow in successive seasons from summer to midsummer. winter. Our study supports IAV amplification during summer breeding seeded by locally persisting hibernation virus and introduced virus from a wide range of latitudes. As birds migrate from breeding sites to lower latitudes, they engage in transmission networks with increased connectivity with other bird species, with interspecies transmission of reassortant viruses peaking during winter. We propose that changing transmission dynamics may be a critical strategy for pathogens infecting mobile hosts that inhabit regions with strong seasonality.",,"Hill, N. J.;Ma, E. J.;Meixell, B.

793,Microbial ecology throughout the gastrointestinal tract,"The ecosystem of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract undergoes a series of environmental, chemical, and physical conditions as it extends from the oral cavity to the anus. These differences in conditions along with the foods or other ingested substrates affect the composition and density of the microbiota as well as their functional functions by selecting those that are most suitable for that environment. Previous studies have focused mainly on bacteria, and the number of studies on Archaea, Eukarya, and viruses is limited despite their important roles in this ecosystem. Additionally, due to the challenges associated with collecting samples directly from inside humans, many studies are still exploratory, with a primary focus on the composition of microbiomes. Therefore, mechanistic studies to investigate functions are carried out using animal models. However, the differences in physiology and microbiomes need to be clarified to aid in the translation of the animal model findings to the context of humans. This review will highlight bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses, discuss differences along the GI tract of healthy humans, and make comparisons with three common animal models: rats, mice, and pigs.",,"Hillman, E.

794,"TTV, a new human virus with single-stranded circular DNA genome","TT virus (TTV) was found in 1997 in a patient with hepatitis without viral markers. However, the actual impact of TTV on liver diseases remains uncertain to date. Due to the lack of adequate cellular systems to support the growth of TTV, the biology of TTV is still obscure. This review attempts to summarize the current status of TTV in aspects other than the taxonomic diversity of TTV. TTV was the first human virus with a single-stranded circular DNA genome. TTV was considered to be a member of the Circoviridae, but others suggested that it fit into a new family. TTV is distinct from the ambisense viruses of the Circovirus genus in that the anterior genome is negative-stranded. The genome structure of TTV is most closely related to chicken anemia virus of the genus Gyrovirus, however, sequence similarity is minimal except for a short stretch at 3816-3851 of TA278. Currently, the working group proposes the full name for TTV as TorqueTenoVirus and TTV-like mini virus as TorqueTenoMiniVirus (TTMV) in a new genus Anellovirus (ring). TTVs are prevalent in nonhuman primates, and human TTV can cross-infect chimpanzees. Furthermore, TTV sequences have been detected in chickens, pigs, cattle and sheep. TTV can be transmitted by infection from mother to child. However, within a year after birth, the prevalence reaches the same level for children born to TTV-positive and TTV-negative mothers, even without breastfeeding. The non-coding region surrounding a short GC-rich stretch of 113 nt and occupying approximately one-third of the genome is considered to contain the putative origin of replication. Three mRNAs are expressed by TTV, 3.0 and 1.2 and 1.0 kb species. A 3.0 kb mRNA translated protein is considered to be the major capsid protein as well as the replicase. The nature of the proteins translated by the other two mRNAs remains putative. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Hino, S.",2002.0,,10.1002/rmv.351,0
795,Torque teno virus (TTV): current status,"Torque teno virus (TTV), currently classified in the Circoviridae family, Anellovirus genus, was found for the first time in a patient with non-AD hepatitis. TTV has a single-stranded circular DNA of 3.8 kb. TTVs are extraordinarily diverse, spanning five groups, including SANBAN and SEN viruses. Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) with a 2.9 kb genome also has wide variants. Recently, two related species of 2.2 and 2.6 kb joined this community. Recombinations between variants are frequent. This wide diversity of TTV remains unexplained; it is not clear how TTVs could be viable and why they require such genetic variation. An unambiguous cultural system is not yet available. TTVs are ubiquitous in >90% of adults worldwide, but the pathogenicity of TTV in humans has not been fully established. Epidemiological surveys should specify the variants being studied and the clinical objectives, and should gauge the sensitivity of the assay used. Potentially interesting observations include increased viral load in patients with severe idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, cancer, and lupus. Active replication was also found in infants with acute respiratory illnesses. TTV/TTMV-related viruses were found in chimpanzees, apes, African monkeys, and tupaias, and also in chickens, pigs, cattle, sheep, and dogs. Experimentally, rhesus monkeys were persistently infected by TTV, but only 1/53 chimpanzees. TTV transcribes three mRNA species, 3.0, 1.2 and 1.0 kb in a ratio of 60:5:35. Recently, at least three mRNAs were shown in chicken anemia virus. Genomic region -154/-76 contains a critical promoter. TTV appears to have at least three proteins; however, the defined functions of these proteins await further investigation.

796,Relationship of the Torque teno virus with the anemia virus of chickens,"This chapter examines the correlation between Torque teno virus (TTV) and avian anemia virus (CAV). Each has a circular single-stranded (ss) DNA genome with each of its known open reading frames (ORFs) on its antigenomic strand. This structure is distinct from those of the circoviruses. The genome sizes of TTV and CAV are different, 3.8 kb and 2.3 kb, respectively. While the spectrum of the TTV genome is enormously diverse, that of the CAV genome is quite narrow. Although a 36 nt stretch near the origin of replication of TA278 TTV has more than 80% similarity to that of CAV, the sequence of the other genomic regions does not show significant similarity. However, the relative assignment of ORFs in each frame in these viruses mimics each other. Three or more messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are generated by transcription in both. The structural protein with the replicase domain is encoded by framework 1 in each virus, and a nonstructural protein with a phosphatase domain is encoded by framework 2. A protein in framework 3 in each virus induces apoptosis in cells transformed. Recently, we confirmed that apoptin is required for CAV replication. TTV has been proposed to constitute a new family, Anelloviridae. Considering these similarities and differences between CAV and TTV, it seems more reasonable to place CAV, the only member of the Gyrovirus genus, in the Anelloviridae together with TTV, or in a new independent family. © 2009 Springer.",,"Hino, S.;Prasetyo, A.

797,Conservation of proteinase L and 3C activities in distantly related aphthoviruses,"The leader proteinase (L) of FMDV is an important determinant of virulence in FMDV infections. It has two distinct catalytic activities: (i) C-terminal processing at the L/VP4 junction; and (ii) the induction of cleavage of the translation initiation factor eIF4G, an event that inhibits cap-dependent translation in infected cells. The only other member of the Aphthovirus genus, equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), also encodes an L protein, but shares only 32% amino acid identity with its FMDV counterpart. Another more distantly related picornavirus, equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV), which is not classified as an aphthovirus, also encodes an L protein. Using in vitro transcription and translation analysis, we have shown that the L proteins of ERAV and ERBV have C-terminal processing activity. Furthermore, expression of ERAV L, but not ERBV L, in BHK-21 cells resulted in efficient inhibition of cap-dependent translation in these cells. We have shown that the EBAV and FMDV L proteinases induce cleavage of eIF4GI at very similar or identical positions. Interestingly, ERAV 3C also induces eIF4GI cleavage and again produces distinct products that comigrate with those induced by FMDV 3C. ERBV L proteinase does not induce cleavage of eIF4GI, consistent with its inability to stop cap-dependent translation. We have also shown that another unique feature of FMDV L, stimulation of enterovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity, is also shared by the proteinase ERAV L but not by ERBV L. Functional conservation of divergent proteinases of ERAV and FMDV indicates the likelihood that these enzymes play a similar and important role in the pathogenesis of infections caused by these distantly related FMDVs.",,"Hinton, T.

798,"Epidemiology of rabies virus transmitted by vampire bats in Goias, central Brazil: reassessment based on the GL intergenic region","BACKGROUND: Vampire bat-related rabies harms both the livestock industry and the public health sector in central Brazil. The geographic distributions of rabies virus variants transmitted by vampire bats are delimited by mountain ranges. These findings were elucidated by analysis of a highly conserved nucleoprotein gene. This study aims to elucidate the detailed epidemiological characters of rabies virus transmitted by vampire bats by phylogenetic methods based on the 619 nt sequence, including the non-conserved GL intergenic region. FINDINGS: Vampire bat-transmitted rabies virus isolates divided into 8 phylogenetic lineages in the previous nucleoprotein gene analysis divided into 10 phylogenetic lineages with significant bootstrap values. The distributions of most variants were reconfirmed to be bounded by mountain ranges. Also, variants in rolling areas have narrow distributions and are apparently separated by mountain ranges. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the 619 nt sequence including the GL intergenic region is more useful for a state-level phylogenetic analysis of rabies virus than the partial nucleoprotein gene and, at the same time, that the distribution of RABV variants transmitted by vampire bats tend to be separate. not only by mountain ranges but also by mountain ridges, suggesting that the diversity of RABV variants transmitted by vampire bats was bounded by geographic undulations.",,"Hirano, S.;Itou, T.;Carvalho, A.

The hypothesis that HIV-2 (and SIVmac) arose by interspecies transmission from black mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) has been strengthened by further characterization of the SIVsm/SIVmac/HIV-2 group of viruses. The SIV of the four subspecies of African green monkeys (SIVagm) has been characterized with an apparent chimeric genomic structure of SIVagm from West African green monkeys. Although these naturally infected primates remain healthy, interspecies transmission to other primate species can result in immunodeficiency, such as that caused by SIVsm infection of macaque monkeys (Macaca sp.) and more recently, SIVsm infection of tailed macaques. pig (M. nemestrina).

This MAb also blocked infection of fcwf-4 cells by feline enteric coronavirus type II (FECV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). On the other hand, it did not block FIPV type I infection. MAb RG-4 recognized a polypeptide of relative molecular mass of 120-130 kDa in feline intestinal brush border membrane (BBM) proteins. The polypeptide possessed aminopeptidase activity, and the first N-terminal 15 amino acid sequence was identical to that of feline APN. Feline intestinal BBM proteins and polypeptide reacted with MAb RG-4 (feline APN) inhibited the infectivity of FIPV type II, FECV type II, CCV, and TGEV to fcwf-4 cells, but did not inhibit the infectivity of FIPV type I .",,"Hohdatsu, T.;Izumiya, Y.;Yokoyama, Y.;Kida, K.;Koyama, H.",1998.0,,,0
806,"Characterization of monoclonal antibodies against type II feline infectious peritonitis virus and antigenic relationship between feline, porcine and canine coronaviruses","Seven monoclonal antibodies (MAb) with neutralizing activity against feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) strain 79-1149 (type II) were prepared. When the polypeptide specificity recognized by these monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was investigated by immunoblotting, all MAbs reacted with the virus peplomer glycoprotein (S). By competitive binding assay these MAbs were found to recognize at least 3 different epitopes. The reactivity of these MAbs with 6 viruses classified as FIPV type I (UCD-1, UCD-2, UCD-3, UCD-4, NW-1 and Black), feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) type II strain 79-1683, canine coronavirus (CCV) strain 1-71 and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strains TO-163 and SH were examined by neutralization tests. All MAbs neutralized FECV strain 79-1683, CCV strain 1-71, and TGEV strains TO-163 and SH, while they did not neutralize all 6 FIPV type I viruses. In addition, the MAb against TGEV strain TO- 163, which has strong neutralizing activity against 7 TGEV viruses, neutralized CCV strain 1-71, FECV strain 79-1683, and FIPv strain 79-1146, but did not neutralize all 6 FIPV type I viruses. These results showed that there are at least 3 epitopes involved in the neutralization of FIPV type II strain 79-1146, and that these epitopes are not present in FIPV type I viruses but are present in FECV strain 79-1683 which does not induce feline infection. peritonitis, TGEV strains TO-163 and SH, and CCV strain 1-71. These results suggest the presence of 2 serotypes of FIPV that can be clearly distinguished by the neutralization test with MAbs.",,"Hohdatsu, T.;Okada, S.;Koyama, H.",1991.0,,,0

809,Tembusu-like flavivirus (Perak virus) as a cause of neurological disease outbreaks in young Pekin ducks,"In 2012, a neurological disease of young Pekin ducks characterized by ataxia, lameness and paralysis was observed in several duck farms in Malaysia. Gross pathologic lesions were absent or inconsistent in most cases, but severe and consistent microscopic lesions were found in the brain. and spinal cord, characterized by nonpurulent panencephalomyelitis. Several viruses isolated from embryonated duck eggs and from cell cultures (Vero and DF-1) were obtained inoculated with brain homogenates from affected ducks. After exclusion of other viruses, isolates were identified as flaviviruses by flavivirus-specific reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Inoculation of 2-week-old Pekin ducks with an isolated flavivirus subcutaneously or intramuscularly resulted in typical clinical signs and histological lesions in the brain and spinal cord. The inoculated virus was detected by RT-PCR from duck organ samples with clinical signs and histological lesions. With a few days delay, the disease was also observed among mixed contact control birds. Phylogenetic analysis of the NS5 and E gene sequences showed that the isolates were representatives of a new phylogenetic group within clade XI (Ntaya virus group) of the Flavivirus genus. This Malaysian Duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV), named Perak virus, has moderate genomic RNA sequence similarity to a related DTMUV identified in China. In our experiment, the Malaysian strain of DTMUV could be transmitted in the absence of mosquito vectors. These findings may have implications for the control and prevention of this emerging group of flaviviruses.",,"Homonnay, Z. G.;KovÃ¡cs, E.

810,The high genetic variation of viruses of the genus Nairovirus reflects the diversity of their predominant tick hosts.,"The genus Nairovirus (family Bunyaviridae) contains seven serogroups consisting of 34 predominantly tick-borne viruses, including several associated with serious disease in humans and cattle [eg. eg, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and Nairobi sheep disease (NSD), respectively]. Prior to this report, no comparative genetic studies or molecular detection assays had been developed for this genus of viruses. To characterize at least one representative of each of the seven serogroups, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) primers targeting the polymerase L-encoding region of the RNA genome of these serogroups were successfully designed. viruses based on conserved amino acid motifs present in the predicted catalytic core region. Sequence analysis showed that the nairoviruses were a highly diverse group, exhibiting nucleotide and amino acid identity differences of up to 39.4% and 46.0%, respectively. The genetic relationships of the virus correlated well with serological groupings and with tick host associations. Hosts of these viruses include both hard (family Ixodidae) and soft (family Argasidae) ticks. Phylogenetic analysis of viruses reveals two main monophyletic groups: viruses vectored by hard ticks and soft ticks. In addition, tick-borne viruses of the genera Ornithodoros, Carios, and Argas also form three separate monophyletic lineages. The striking similarities between the phylogenies of ticks and nairoviruses are consistent with the possible co-evolution of viruses and their tick hosts. Fossil and phylogenetic data placing the divergence between the hard tick and the soft tick between 120 and 92 million years ago suggest an ancient origin for viruses of the genus Nairovirus. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

811,"Rapid detection, characterization and enumeration of foodborne pathogens","As food safety management develops further, microbiological testing will continue to play an important role in assessing whether food safety objectives are achieved. However, traditional microbiological culture-based methods are limited, particularly in their ability to provide timely data. This review discusses the reasons for the growing interest in rapid methods, current developments in the field, research needs, and future trends. The advent of biotechnology has introduced new technologies that have led to the emergence of rapid diagnostic methods and altered food testing practices. Rapid methods are comprised of many different detection technologies, including specialized enzyme substrates, antibodies, and DNA, ranging from simple differential plating media to the use of sophisticated instruments. The use of noninvasive sampling techniques for live animals came into sharp focus with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy outbreak in the 1990s that was linked to the human outbreak of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease. Serology remains an important tool in preventing foodborne pathogens from entering the human food supply through animal meat and milk. One of the main uses of rapid methods is the rapid detection of a large number of samples, where most of them are expected to be negative, leading to a faster release of the product for sale. This has been the main strength of rapid methods such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Enrichment PCR, in which a primary culture broth is analyzed in PCR, is the most common approach in rapid testing. Recent reports show that it is possible to enrich a sample and enumerate by pathogen-specific real-time PCR, if the enrichment time is short. This can be especially helpful in situations where food producers are requesting the pathogen level in a contaminated product. Another key issue is automation, where the key drivers are miniaturization and multiple testing, meaning that not only is one instrument flexible enough to detect many pathogens, but many pathogens can be detected with a single test. The review is based primarily on the scientific work of the author who has contributed the following new developments in this field: (i) serological tests for large-scale screening, surveillance or eradication programs, (ii) same-day detection of Salmonella that was otherwise considered difficult to achieve, (iii) enumeration of pathogens after a brief log-phase enrichment, (iv) detection of foodborne pathogens in air samples, and finally (v) biological tracking of pathogens based on mathematical models, even in the absence of isolation. The rapid methods are analyzed from a broad perspective of global health, the international food supply and the improvement of quantitative microbial risk assessments. The need for quantitative sample preparation techniques, culture-independent metagenomics-based detection, online monitoring, a global validation infrastructure has been emphasized. The cost and ease of use of rapid assays remain difficult obstacles to overcome. © 2011 The author. APMIS © 2011 APMIS.",,"Hoorfar, J.",2011.0,,10.1111/j.1600-0463.2011.02767.x,0
812,Biological and biochemical characterization of sheep scrapie in Japan,"Due to the apparent absence of an agent-specific nucleic acid genome, scrapie strains cannot be classified by genome characterization, which is commonly used for classification of many viruses. However, scrapie strains can be distinguished to some extent by their biological properties, such as transmissibility to experimental animals and the distribution of neuropathological lesions, and by their biochemical properties, such as molecular mass and relative resistance to infection. disease-specific isoform protease of prion protein (PrPSc). . In order to preliminarily characterize scrapie strains prevalent in Japan, we analyzed the transmissibility of sheep scrapie isolates to mice and the relative proteinase K (PK) resistance of the corresponding PrPSc. The results indicate that Japanese scrapie strains can be divided into at least three groups based on their biological and biochemical properties. The first group includes isolates that cause disease in mice with an incubation period of 400 days and possess PrPSc with relatively high PK resistance. Isolates from the second group contain PrPSc which is highly resistant to PK digestion but transmits poorly to mice. The final group consists of isolates that cause disease in mice with an incubation period of less than 300 days and are associated with PrPSc with reduced PK resistance. Sheep scrapie has occurred sporadically in Japan since 1982, with only 60 cases officially reported so far. However, the diversity of scrapie strains in the field suggested by our data raises concern that a scrapie strain similar to the parent agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy may exist or arise in Japan. Therefore, continued scrapie surveillance will be required to prevent further spread of scrapie, not only among the sheep population but also among other species, and to eliminate any potential risk of sheep scrapie to public health.",,"Horiuchi, M.;Nemoto, T.;Ishiguro, N.;Furuoka, H.;Mohri, S.;Shinagawa, M.",2002.0,,10.1128/jcm.40.9.3421-3426.2002,0
813,Rabies in Iraq: Trends in human cases 2001-2010 and characterization of animal rabies strains from Baghdad,"Rabies control requires a constant supply of reliable resources, constructive cooperation between veterinary and public health authorities, and systematic surveillance. These are challenging in any circumstance, but particularly during conflict. Here we describe available human rabies surveillance data from Iraq, the results of renewed sampling for rabies in animals, and the first genetic characterization of circulating rabies strains from Iraq. Human rabies is notifiable, with an increase in reported cases since 2003 and a marked increase in Baghdad between 2009 and 2010. These changes coincide with an increasing number of reported dog bites. There is no laboratory confirmation of disease or virus characterization and no systematic surveillance of rabies in animals. To address these issues, brain samples were collected from domestic animals in the Baghdad metropolitan region and tested for rabies. Three of the 40 brain samples were positive by fluorescent antibody test and semi-nested RT-PCR for rabies virus (RABV). Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using sample-derived partial nucleoprotein gene sequences showed that the viruses belong to a single virus variant and share a common ancestor with viruses from neighboring countries, 22 years ago (95% HPD 14-32). These include countries to the west, north and east of Iraq, some of which also have other variants of the virus circulating at the same time. These results suggest possible multiple introductions of rabies into the Middle East and regular transboundary movement of the disease. Although 4,000 years have passed since the original description of the disease consistent with rabies, animals and humans continue to die from this neglected and preventable zoonosis. © 2013 Horton et al.",,"Horton, D.

814,A new family of vertebrate viruses: Toroviridae,"The proposed family Toroviridae is characterized by peplomer-enveloped particles containing an elongated tubular nucleocapsid with helical symmetry. The capsid can be folded into an open torus, conferring a biconcave disk or kidney-shaped morphology to the virion (major diameter 120-140 nm), or the capsid can be straight, resulting in a rod-shaped particle (35 x 170 nm). nm). Morphogenesis is by budding of preformed nucleocapsids across membranes, primarily the Golgi system and the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The Berne virus, which is proposed as a prototype family, contains a single strand of infectious positive-sense RNA, M(r) of approximately 6.5 x 106, which is polyadenylated. The RNA is surrounded by the major nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (M(r) about 20,000), which in turn is enveloped by a membrane containing a major protein (M(r) 22,000) and a phosphoprotein (M( r) 37,000). Viral peplomers, about 20 nm long, carry determinants for neutralization and hemagglutination; they are made up of a polydisperse N-glycosylated protein (M(r) 75,000-100,000). Four major subgenomic polyadenylated RNAs have been identified in infected cells, with M(r)s of 3.0, 0.71, 0.46, and 0.26 x 106. Torovirus replication is inhibited by actinomycin D, alpha-amanitin and pre-irradiation of the host cell with UV light. All toroviruses identified to date cause enteric infections and are probably transmitted by the fecal-oral route.

In this study, bulk tank milk from 36 dairy cattle herds in eastern China underwent serological investigations, 77.8% of the herds were positive for BVDV antibodies. The status of individual animals in two herds was further investigated by collecting blood samples, the positive proportion was 49.74% and 24.64%, and the average positive proportion of calves, heifers and lactating cows it was 15.94%, 40.16% and 41.7%, respectively. In addition, a clinical survey was conducted among 8,170 dairy cows from 36 herds, for diarrhea syndrome, respiratory problems, and reproductive failure, and pathogens of all clinical cattle were further investigated. The results showed that BVDV was one of the main pathogens infecting animals, combining with several other viruses. Then, nine strains of BVDV were isolated; Phylogenetic analysis showed that the BVDV subtypes currently circulating in eastern China were BVDV 1a and BVDV 1c. In addition, of 377 cows analyzed, 1.86% detected positive for the BVDV antigen.

The rabbit genome was used as a reference to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at different time points post-infection. The top 10 DEGs were filtered according to their importance and we searched for their biological functions through the Uniprot and NCBI databases. The first three time points have 10 genes that are co-expressed, many of which have a relationship to immunity and inflammation. The last two time points for the top 10 DEGs are identical, and B2M, RLA-DR-ALPHA, CD74, and IGJ are involved in the antiviral immune response. The GO functional annotation revealed that in the biological processes at each time point, except for 24 hours post-infection, the immune response has the largest number of terms, followed by metabolism and regulation. Consistent with the KEGG database, DEGs for 24 hours post-infection were enriched for RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway and DEGs for 30 hours post-infection were found to have focal adhesion and an ECM-receptor interaction pathway. Furthermore, DEGs for 36 hands 48 h after infection have seven identical pathways, of which were directly or indirectly related to antiviral response. These pathways included the proteasome, lysosome, ribosome, chemokine signaling pathways, B-cell receptor signaling pathway, antigen processing and presentation pathway, and the Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis pathway. -strain C infection, and provides a theoretical basis for further understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which rabbits adapt to strain C infection.",,"Hou, Y.;Zhao, D.;Liu, G.;He, F.;Liu, B.;Fu, S.;Hao, Y.;Zhang, W.",2016.0,,,0
817,Molecular and phylogenetic analysis of a new amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV-1313),"Background: Amphotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLV-A) are naturally occurring, exogenously acquired gammaretroviruses that are indigenous to wild mice in southern California. These viruses replicate in a wide range of cell types, including human cells in vitro, and can cause both hematologic and neurologic disorders in wild-type and inbred laboratory mice. Since MuLV-A also exhibit discrete interference and neutralization properties, the envelope proteins of these viruses have been extremely useful in studying virus-host cell interactions and as vehicles for the transfer of foreign genes to a variety of hosts. including human cells. However, the genomic structure of any of the several known MuLV-As has not been established, and the evolutionary relationship of amphotropic retroviruses to the numerous exogenous or endogenous MuLV strains remains elusive. Here we present a complete genetic structure of a new amphotropic virus named MuLV-1313 and show that this retrovirus, along with other MuLV-A, belongs to a distinct molecular, biological, and phylogenetic class among MuLV strains isolated from a large number of strains. laboratory inbreds. or wild mice. Results: The host range of MuLV-1313 is similar to that of previously isolated MuLV-As, except that this virus replicates efficiently in mammalian cells as well as chicken cells. Compared to ENV proteins from other MuLV-As (4070A, 1504A, and 10A-1), MuLV-1313 gp70 protein has differences in its signal peptides and proline-rich hinge regions. However, the MuLV-1313 coat protein is completely unrelated to those present in a wide range of murine retroviruses that have been isolated from various inbred and wild-type mice worldwide. Genetic analysis of the entire MuLV-1313 genome using dot plot analysis, which compares each nucleotide of one genome with the corresponding nucleotide of another, revealed that the genome of this virus, with the exception of the env gene, is most closely related. with the biologically distinct ecotropic wild-type mouse retrovirus (Cas-Br-E) isolated from another region of southern California, than with any of the 15 MuLV strains whose complete sequences are present in GenBank. This finding was corroborated by phylogenetic analyzes and hierarchical clustering of the complete genome sequence of MuLV-1313, which also placed all MULV-As in a genetically distinct category among the large family of retroviruses isolated from numerous strains of mice worldwide. . Furthermore, the construction of separate dendrograms for each of the MuLV-1313 Gag, Pol and Env proteins demonstrated that amphotropic retroviruses belong to a phylogenetically exclusive group of gammaretroviruses compared to all known MuLV strains. Conclusion: The molecular, biological, and phylogenetic properties of amphotropic retroviruses, including MuLV-1313, are distinct compared to a large family of ecotropic, polytropic, and xenotropic MuLV strains transmitted exogenously or endogenously from wild-type and laboratory mice. Furthermore, both the naturally occurring amphotropic and the biologically discrete ecotropic retroviruses of wild mice from southern California are more closely related to each other on the evolutionary tree than any other mammalian gammaretroviruses, indicating a common origin of these viruses.

Cloacal and tracheal swabs were taken each month from 30 randomly selected birds that appeared healthy. All swabs were negative for influenza A virus recovery, while 87.5% of tracheal swabs and 100% of cloacal swabs collected in September 2007 were positive for influenza A virus isolation. Newcastle. Several NDV isolates were recovered from tracheal and cloacal swabs of apparently healthy ducks. All isolates were nonpathogenic as determined by the MDT and ICPI. The HN gene and the variable region of the F gene (nt 47-420) from four randomly selected isolates were sequenced. A 374 bp region of the F gene and the full length of the HN gene were used for phylogenetic analysis. Four isolates were identified as the same isolate based on nucleotide sequence identities of 99.2-100%, showing a closer phylogenetic relationship to thelentogenic class I viruses. There were nucleotide differences of 1.9-9.9 % between isolates and other Class I viruses in the variable region of the F gene (nt 47-420), while there were nucleotide differences of 38.5-41.2% between isolates and Class II viruses. The amino acid sequences of the F protein cleavage sites in these isolates were 112-ERQERL-117. The total length of the HN gene from these isolates was 1851 bp, encoding 585 amino acids. Homology analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the HN gene indicated that there were 2.0-4.2% nucleotide differences between isolates and other Class I viruses, while there were 29.5-40.9% differences. between isolates and Class II viruses. The results show that these isolates are not phylogenetically related to the vaccine strain (LaSota).

Vaccination with strain C is one of the most effective ways to contain this disease. Since 2014, sporadic outbreaks of classical swine fever have occurred in some provinces of China vaccinated with the C strain. To decipher the etiology of the disease, 25 CSFV E2 genes from 169 clinical samples were cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analyzes revealed that all 25 isolates belonged to the 2.1 subgenotype. Twenty-three of the 25 isolates clustered into a newly defined subgenotype, 2.1d, and shared some consistent molecular features. To determine whether the entire E2 gene was under positive selection pressure, we used site-by-site analysis to identify specific codons that underwent evolutionary selection, and seven positively selected codons were found. Three positively selected sites (amino acids 17, 34 and 72) in the B/C domains relevant to the antigenicity of the amino-terminal half of the E2 protein were identified. In addition, another positively selected site (amino acid 200) exhibited a change in polarity from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, which may change CSFV antigenicity and virulence. The results indicate that CSFV strains circulating in Shandong province mainly clustered in the 2.1d subgenotype. Furthermore, identification of these positively selected sites could help reveal molecular determinants of virulence or pathogenesis and clarify the driving force behind CSFV evolution in eastern China.",,"Hu, D.;Lv, L.;Gu, J.;Chen, T.;Xiao, Y.;Liu, S.",2016.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2016.00085,0

However, its role in influenza A virus (IAV) pathogenicity remains largely unexplored. Here, using next-generation sequencing, we systematically compare the whole transcriptome response of infected mouse lung with highly pathogenic (A/Chicken/Jiangsu/k0402/2010, CK10) or nonpathogenic (A/Goose/Jiangsu/k0403). / 2010, GS10) H5N1 virus. A total of 126 significantly differentially expressed (SDE) lncRNAs from three replicates were identified associated with high virulence of CK10, while 94 SDE lncRNAs were related to GS10. Functional category analysis suggested that mRNAs coexpressed by CK10-regulated SDE lncRNAs were highly related to aberrant and uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Additional canonical pathway analysis also confirmed that these targets were highly enriched for pathways related to inflammation. Furthermore, 9 lncRNAs and 17 co-expressed lncRNAs-mRNAs associated with a large number of specific genes were successfully verified by qRT-PCR. A targeted lncRNA (NONMMUT011061) that was markedly activated and correlated with a large number of mRNAs was selected for further analysis, including predication of transcription factors, potential interacting proteins, genomic location, coding ability, and construction of the protein. secondary structure. More importantly, NONMMUT011061 was also clearly stimulated during highly pathogenic H5N8 virus infection in mice, suggesting a possible universal role of NONMMUT011061 in the pathogenesis of different H5 IAVs. Taken together, these results provide a subset of lncRNAs that could play an important role in influenza virus pathogenesis and add lncRNAs to the broad repertoire of host factors used by IAVs for infection and persistence.",,"Hu, J.;Hu, Z.;Wang, X.;Gu, M.;Gao, Z.;Liang, Y.;Ma, C.;Liu, X.;Hu, S.;Chen, S.;Peng, D.;Jiao, X.;Liu, X.",2018.0,,,0

825,Computational study of interdependence between hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic,"Type A influenza viruses are classified into subtypes based on their two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The HA protein facilitates viral attachment and entry into a host cell, and the NA protein aids in the release of viral progeny from the infected cell. The complementary functions of HA and NA imply their collaboration, which has important implications for viral replication and fitness. The HA protein from early 2009 pandemic H1N1 strains of porcine origin preferentially binds to human-like receptors with weak binding to avian-like receptors. This virus caused several human deaths in December 2013 in Texas, USA, which prompted us to investigate changes in genetic characteristics that could contribute to increased virulence of the virus. Our time-series analysis on strains of this virus collected between 2009 and 2013 implied that the HA-binding preference of this virus in the US, Europe, and Asia has been the hallmark of swine H1N1 since 2009. Binding avidity for avian-like receptors were steadily increasing and had a clear increase in 2013, with American strains showing the most pronounced increase. The first change could improve viral transmission and replication in humans, and the second could increase its ability to cause infections deep in the lungs, which could explain the recent human deaths in Texas. In light of HA and NA co-adaptation and evolutionary interactions, we also explored the NA activity of this virus to reveal the functional balance between HA and NA during the course of virus evolution. Finally, we identified amino acid substitutions in virus HA and NA that were critical for the observed evolution.",,"Hu, W.",2015.0,,10.1109/tnb.2015.2406992,0

827,Rapid Genome Sequencing and Characterization of Novel Influenza A H7N9 Virus of Avian Origin Directly from Clinical Specimen Using Semiconductor Sequencing,"BACKGROUND: Recent outbreaks of severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome have attracted much public interest. The rapid and accurate diagnosis of the causal agent is key to an adequate response to suspected outbreaks. OBJECTIVES: We present a case that highlights the potential of semiconductor sequencing to rapidly determine the genome sequences of the new virus. STUDY DESIGN: We have developed a method for rapid de novo assembly of novel H7N9 influenza A virus genome directly from a patient's tracheal aspirate using a semiconductor sequencer without culture and prior sequence information. In addition, characteristic amino acids and phylogenetic analyzes were performed for key influenza A virus genes. RESULTS: Deep sequencing yielded 435,239 reads assigned to H7N9 viruses, with an average length of 172 bp, representing 18 .6% of total reads (2,339,680). The complete genome of the virus was obtained by the de novo assembly method in 2 days. The average genomic coverage depth of the Ion Torrent PGM was up to 5679 times. Selected characteristic amino acids were observed and phylogenetic analyzes showed that the new H7 virus was genetically close to the 2011 Zhejiang duck H7N3 viruses. The new N9 sequences were most closely related to N9 gene sequences derived from H11N9 ducks in 2011 in Jiangxi and H2N9 sequences from Hong Kong in 2010 in China, and thus may share a common ancestor. CONCLUSIONS: Sequence-independent semiconductor sequencing is a powerful tool to investigate the outbreak of a new pathogen.",,"Hu, Y.;Ren, X.;Li, L.;Xiao, Y.;Dong, J.;Sun, L.;Zhu, Y.;Yang, F.;Zhang, X.;Jin, Q.",2015.0,Dec,,0
828,Different microRNA alterations contribute to different outcomes after EV71 and CA16 infections: insights from high-throughput sequencing in rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) are the predominant pathogens of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Although these viruses exhibit genetic homology, the clinical manifestations caused by the two viruses have some discrepancies. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms leading to these differences remain unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in numerous biological or pathological processes, including host responses to viral infections. Here, we focused on differences in miRNA expression patterns in EV71- and CA16-infected rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at various time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 106 known and 13 new miRNAs showed significant differences, and 32 key miRNAs between them for target prediction showed opposite trends in the EV71- and CA16-infected samples. GO and pathway analysis of predicted targets showed enrichment in 14 biological processes, 10 molecular functions, 8 cellular components, and 104 pathways. Subsequently, regulatory networks of miRNA transcription factors, predicted miRNA targets, miRNA-GO, and miRNA pathways were constructed to reveal the complex regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during the infection phase. Ultimately, we analyzed the hierarchical GO categories of predicted targets involved in immune system processes, indicating that innate and adaptive immunity after EV71 and CA16 infections may be markedly distinct. In conclusion, this report is the first to describe miRNA expression profiles in PBMC with EV71 and CA16 infections using high-throughput sequencing. Our findings could provide a valuable basis for future studies on the regulatory functions of miRNAs related to the different immune responses caused by EV71 and CA16 infections.",,"Hu, Y.;Song, J.;Liu, L.;Li, J.;Tang, B.;Wang, J.;Zhang, X.;Zhang, Y.;Wang, L.;Liao, Y.;He, Z.;Li, Q.",2016.0,,10.1016/j.biocel.2016.10.011,0
829,Comparative analysis of microRNAs in response to EV71 and CA16 infection in human bronchial epithelial cells by high-throughput sequencing to reveal differential infectious mechanisms,"Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) caused mainly by Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) infections that presented significantly different clinical manifestations. However, the factors underlying these differences remain unclear. Recently, the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pathogen-host interactions have been highlighted. Here, we performed a comprehensive miRNA profile in human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE) infected with EV71 and CA16 at multiple time points using high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that 154 known and 47 new miRNAs exhibited striking differences in expression. Of these, 65 miRNAs, including 58 known and 7 new miRNAs, exhibited opposite trends in the EV71 and CA16-infected samples. Subsequently, we mainly focused on the 56 known differentially expressed miRNAs by additional screening for target prediction. GO and pathway analysis of these targets showed that 18 biological processes, 7 molecular functions, 1 cellular component, and 123 pathways were enriched. Among these pathways, Cadherin signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, and angiogenesis showed significant alterations. The regulatory networks of these miRNAs with predicted targets, GOs, pathways, and transcription factors were determined, suggesting that the miRNAs displayed complex regulatory mechanisms during the infection phase. Accordingly, we specifically analyzed the hierarchical GO categories of the predicted targets involved in adherence. The results indicated that the distinct changes induced by EV71 and CA16 infection may be partially related to airway epithelial barrier function. Taken together, our data provide useful information that helps elucidate the different host-pathogen interactions following EV71 and CA16 infection and could offer new therapeutic targets for these infections.",,"Hu, Y.;Song, J.;Liu, L.;Li, J.;Tang, B.;Zhang, Y.;Wang, J.;Wang, L.;Fan, S.;Feng, M.;Li, Q.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2016.11.024,0

The orientation of the transcript of US10 and SORF3 was tail-to-tail, and that of SORF3 and US2 was the same. Potential polyadenylation sites (poly(A)) and core promoters were predicted for US10, SORF3, and US2 and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction.

831,MicroRNA expression profiles of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-infected porcine kidney cell line 15,"To explore the effect of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) on microRNA expression profiles of porcine kidney 15 (PK-15) cells, total RNA was isolated from PK-15 cells with or without PEDV infection. . We then obtained miRNAs using solexa sequencing technology and analyzed these differentially expressed miRNAs. Heat map cluster analysis and GO (ontology, GO) analysis (gene function, MF, molecular) were performed on the significant differences in miRNA expression, and 10 significant differences in miRNA expression were selected by RT -qPCR. The result showed that the expression levels of 214 types of microRNAs (miRNAs) were significantly different in PEDV-infected cells, compared to normal PK-15 cells. Among them, 175 miRNA types were significantly upregulated, while 39 miRNA types were significantly downregulated. Furthermore, the qPCR results of miRNA expression trends were similar to those of solexa sequencing. Heat map cluster analysis showed that the vast majority of viral groups were differentially expressed in miRNA compared to the control group. Go analysis showed that miRNAs are widely involved in the combination, binding protein, protein kinase activity, transfer enzyme activity, transfer of phosphorus-containing radicals, phosphotransferase enzyme activity, and others. biological effects. MiRNA-verified RT-qPCR expression trends were consistent with high-throughput sequencing results. The results showed that porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection had a significant impact on the expression level of miRNA in PK-15 cells, thus providing a new idea for the further study of miRNA preparation for the treatment of PK-15.

832,Pseudorabies viral replication is inhibited by a novel miR-21 target,"Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a swine virus classified as a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily of Herpesviridae. Recent studies have confirmed that viruses regulate gene expression in host cells. Commonly affected genes include oxidative stress response genes, genes involved in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway, and genes related to interferon and interleukin. However, the post-transcriptional regulation of host genes after PRV infection is so far unclear. In this study, we used miRNA microarray approaches to assess miRNA expression in the PRV-infected porcine kidney cell line 15 (PK-15) and observed that miR-21 was expressed at a high level 12 h after PRV-infected cells. cells were infected with PRV. In addition, we identified the chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) (CXC motif), also called interferon-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), as a novel miR-21 target gene. IP-10 was downregulated at 4 h after PRV infection.

833,"Detection of a new porcine parvovirus, PPV4, in Chinese herds","To determine whether the new porcine parvovirus type 4 (PPV4) recently reported in the United States is prevalent in China, a set of specific primers was designed and used for the molecular study of PPV4 among clinical samples collected in various provinces of China between 2006 and 2010. The results showed that PPV4 is present in Chinese herds at a rate of 2.09% (12/573) among clinical samples examined and 0.76% (1/132) among samples taken from healthy animals. We also noted that PPV4 was not detected in samples taken before 2009. Analysis of the coding sequences showed that the Chinese and US genome sequences of PPV4 are closely related with greater than 99% nucleotide sequence identity. Similar to a previous study, viral genomes in head-to-tail configuration of various lengths of the non-coding region were detected. Our findings confirmed that PPV4 is a recently discovered unique virus in pigs. Phylogenetically, PPV4 is most closely related to bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2, which is not a Bocavirus and is not assigned to any Parvovirinae genus) and shares limited amino acid identity ORF1 (33.6%) and ORF2 (24.5%). %). With regard to genome structure and organization, PPV4 encodes an ORF3 in the middle of the viral genome that resembles the Bocavirus genus. However, the PPV4 ORF3-encoded protein shares minimal amino acid identity with the ORF3-encoded proteins of the genus Bocavirus. © 2010 Huang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Huang, L.;Zhai, S.

834,Differences in the intestinal microbiota between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus.,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea, a disastrous gastrointestinal disease, causes great economic losses due to its high infectivity, morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets despite the development and application of various vaccines. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to explore differences in gut microbiota between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The results revealed that the small intestinal microbiota of PEDV-infected suckling piglets showed low diversity and was dominated by Proteobacteria (49.1%). In addition, the composition of the small intestinal microbiota of PEDV-infected suckling piglets showed marked differences from that of uninfected piglets. Some of the taxa that showed differences in abundance between uninfected and PEDV-infected piglets were associated with cellular transport and catabolism, energy metabolism, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, and amino acid metabolism, as determined through the prediction of microbial function based on bacteria. 16S rRNA gene.

835,A selective bottleneck shapes the evolutionary mutant spectra of enterovirus A71 during viral shedding in humans,"RNA viruses accumulate mutations to rapidly adapt to environmental changes. Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) causes various clinical manifestations with occasional serious neurological complications. However, the mechanism by which EV-A71 evolves within the human body is unclear. Using deep sequencing and virus haplotype analysis of various tissues from an autopsy patient, we sought to define the evolutionary pathway by which enterovirus A71 evolves to invade the central nervous system in humans. Broad mutant spectra with divergent mutations were observed at sites of initial infection in the respiratory and digestive systems. After viral invasion, we identified a haplotype switch and a dominant haplotype, with glycine at residue 31 of VP1 (VP1-31G) in viral particles disseminated in the integumentary and central nervous systems. In vitro viral growth and fitness analyzes indicated that VP1-31G conferred growth and a fitness advantage in human neuronal cells, while VP1-31D conferred enhanced replication in human colorectal cells. A higher proportion of VP1-31G was also found among the fatal cases, suggesting that it may facilitate central nervous system infection in humans. Our data provide the first glimpse of EV-A71 quasispecies from oral tissues to the central nervous system in humans, showing broad implications for the surveillance and pathogenesis of this re-emerging viral pathogen.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> EV-A71 remains a global public health burden. Although EV-A71 is the main etiologic agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease, it can also cause neurological pulmonary edema, encephalitis, and even death, especially in children. Understanding the selection processes that enable dissemination and accurately estimating the diversity of EV-A71 during invasion in humans is critical for applications in viral pathogenesis and vaccine studies. Here, we define a selection bottleneck that appears in the respiratory and digestive tissues. The glycine substitution at residue 31 of VP1 helps viruses pass through the bottleneck and invade the central nervous system. This substitution is also advantageous for replication in neuronal cells in vitro. Considering that fatal cases contain an enhanced glycine substitution in VP1-31, we suggest that the higher prevalence of VP1-31G may alter viral tropism and aid central nervous system invasion. Our findings provide new insights into a dynamic mutant spectral switch active during acute viral infection with emerging viral pathogens.",,"Huang, S. W.;Huang, Y. H.;Tsai, H. P.;Kuo, P. H.;Wang, S.

836,Dual ATPase and GTPase activity of replication-associated protein (Rep) from beak and feather disease virus,"Background: Psittacine beak and feather disease affects parrots, resulting in an immunosuppressive disease often characterized by abnormal shape and growth of the animal's beak, feathers, and claws. Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) is a single-stranded circular DNA virus and is classified as a member of the Circoviridae family. Two major open reading frames (ORFs) are known, encoding replication-associated protein (Rep) and capsid-associated protein (Cap). Methods: BFDV Rep and Cap genes were fused with tags and then expressed and purified, respectively. The ATPase and GTPase activities of the recombinant Rep protein are measured. Substrate and ion preference, optimal conditions, effects of ATPase and GTPase inhibitors, and the presence of Cap protein on Rep protein ATPase and GTPase activity are examined. Finally, several mutants study the effects of the motif Walker A, the Walker B motif and a new GYDG motif of the Rep protein in the ATPase and GTPase activities. Results: The recombinant Rep protein was able to show ATPase activity and GTPase activity. The Rep protein was able to hydrolyze both deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. Among the nucleoside triphosphates and deoxynucleoside triphosphates, the substrate preference orders were found to be ATP > GTP > CTP >= UTP and dATP > dGTP > dTTP > dCTP, respectively. Both BFDV Rep protein ATPase and GTPase activity required magnesium ions and the presence of calcium ions significantly inhibited Rep protein ATPase and GTPase activity. Optimal temperatures for ATPase activity and GTPase activity were both 56 degrees C, while their optimal pH values were both pH 7.5. Both the ATPase activity and the GTPase activity of the BFDV Rep protein were significantly downregulated by the polynucleotides and the 36 bp dsDNA (located at the origin of replication) of the BFDV genome. The ATPase activity of the BFDV Rep protein was found to be more sensitive to sodium azide than to sodium orthovanadate and N-ethylmaleimide. Linoleic acid more strongly inhibited Rep protein GTPase activity than dynasore. This suggested that the BFDV Rep protein should be classified as an F-type ATPase and a GTPase sensitive to polyunsaturated fatty acids. In the presence of 10 ng of the Cap protein, the ATPase activity and the GTPase activity of the BFDV Rep protein were significantly increased. In addition, the BFDV Rep protein contains the Walker A motif, the Walker B motif, and a new GYDG motif. Both the ATPase activity and GTPase activity of several Rep protein site-directed and deletion mutants affecting these motifs were significantly reduced, suggesting that all three motifs contribute to ATPase and GTPase activities; specifically. In addition, the ATPase activity and GTPase activity of Rep protein deletion mutants were reversed in the presence of Cap protein. This is the first example of dual ATPase and GTPase activity reported in the BFDV Rep protein. (C) 2015 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Huang, S. W.;Liu, H. P.;Chen, J. K.;Shien, Y. W.;Wong, M.

The seroprevalence of AIV was high in Newfoundland gulls, with 50% of sampled gulls showing evidence of prior infection. Sequences from 16 gull AIVs were determined and analyzed to shed light on the transmission, redistribution, and persistence dynamics of gull AIVs in Atlantic North America. The regrouping of intercontinental and waterfowl lineages prevailed. Of particular interest were a fully Eurasian AIV and another with an intercontinental reassortant waterfowl lineage virus.

Here, we report a 4-year avian influenza virus (AIV) epidemiological study in ducks in the St. John's region of Newfoundland. The overall prevalence of AIV detection in ducks during this study was 7.2%, with American black ducks contributing the vast majority of samples collected and AIV positives. Juvenile ducks showed a significantly higher detection rate of AIV (10.6%) compared to adults (3.4%). Seasonally, AIV prevalence rates were highest in fall (8.4%), but positives were still detected in winter (4.6%). Preliminary serological tests showed a high incidence of prior AIV infection (20/38, 52.6%). A total of 43 viruses were characterized by their HA-NA or HA subtypes, revealing a high diversity of AIV subtypes and little recurrence of subtypes from year to year. Investigation of duck movement patterns in this region showed that this is a largely non-migratory duck population, which may contribute to the observed pattern of high turnover of AIV subtypes. Phylogenetic analysis of 4 H1N1 and one H5N4 AIV showed that these viruses were highly similar to other waterfowl low pathogenicity AIV sequences in North America and assigned all gene segments to American bird clades. In particular, the H1N1 viruses, which were identified in consecutive years, possessed homologous genomes.

841,"Molecular characterization of a highly pathogenic swine: reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus variant in Hubei, China","Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been recognized as one of the most important pathogens of pigs worldwide. In 2006, more than 10 provinces in China suffered from an epizootic outbreak of swine diseases characterized by high fever, red skin, and high morbidity and mortality. From June 2006 to April 2007, we investigated some clinical samples in Hubei province by RT-PCR and cloned several major genes, N gene, GP5 and NSP2, which are shown in this study. Phylogenetic analysis of these genes revealed that the highly pathogenic PRRSV variant, ZB, was responsible for the emerging outbreak of swine disease in 2006 in Hubei province, similar to variants isolated from other Chinese provinces in 2006, and belongs to PRRSV.

842,Clinical Characteristics and Phylogenetic Analysis of Coxsackievirus A9 in Northern Taiwan in 2011,"Background: Coxsackie virus A9 (CA9) was one of the most prevalent serotypes of enterovirus infections in Taiwan in 2011. After several series of patients were reported in the 1960s and 1970s, few studies have focused on the manifestations. symptoms of CA9 infections. Our study explores and deepens the current understanding of CA9. Methods: We analyzed the clinical presentations of 100 culture-tested CA9-infected patients in 2011 by reviewing their medical records and plotted the CA9 phylogenetic tree. Results: Of the 100 patients with culture-proven CA9 infections, the mean (SD) age was 4.6 (3.4) years and the male:female ratio was 1.9. For clinical manifestations, 96 patients (96%) presented with fever and the mean (SD) duration of fever was 5.9 (3.4) days. Sixty-one patients (61%) developed a skin rash, and the predominant pattern was a generalized maculopapular rash without pruritus and without vesicular changes. Although most of the patients had injections in the throat, oral ulcers were found in only 19 cases (19%), of which 6 were diagnosed as herpangina. Complicated cases included: aseptic meningitis (n=8), bronchopneumonia (n=6), acute cerebellitis (n=1), and polio-like syndrome (n=1). Phylogenetic analysis of current CA9 strains is the closest to the CA9 isolate 27-YN-2008 from the border area of mainland China and Myanmar. Conclusions: The most common feature of CA9 during the 2011 epidemic in Taiwan is generalized febrile rash rather than herpangina or foot-and-mouth disease. Since prolonged fever and some complications are possible, caution should be exercised in evaluating patients as well as in predicting the clinical course. © 2013 Huang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Huang, Y.

844,Newcastle disease virus hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein determines tropism and virulence,"The Newcastle disease virus (NDV) hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein plays a crucial role in the infection process. However, the exact contribution of the HN gene to the pathogenesis of NDV is unknown. In this study, the role of the HN gene in NDV virulence was examined. Using reverse genetics procedures, the HN genes of a virulent recombinant NDV strain, rBeaudette C (rBC), and an avirulent recombinant NDV strain, rLaSota, were swapped. The hemadsorption and neuraminidase activities of the chimeric viruses showed significant differences from those of their parental strains, but the F and HN heterotypic pairs were equally effective in promoting fusion. It was shown that the tissue tropism of viruses depends on the origin of the HN protein. Chimeric virus with virulent virus-derived HN protein showed similar tissue predilection as virulent virus, and vice versa. Chimeric viruses with reciprocal HN proteins gained or lost virulence, as determined by a standard chicken intracerebral pathogenicity index test and by mean time to death in chicken embryos (a measure designed to classify these viruses), indicating that virulence is a function of amino acid differences in the HN protein. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that NDV virulence is multigenic and that F protein cleavage alone does not determine the virulence of a strain.",,"Huang, Z.;Panda, A.;Elankumaran, S.;Govindarajan, D.;Rockemann, D.

845,Comparison of microbiomes between populations of poultry red mites (Dermanyssus gallinae): predominance of Bartonella-like bacteria,"Red blood-feeding bird mites (RPMs) serve as vectors of pathogenic bacteria and viruses among vertebrate hosts, including wild birds, chickens, mammals, and humans. The RPM microbiome has yet to be studied by high-throughput sequencing. Samples of congested RPM eggs, larvae, and adults/nymphs obtained from four poultry houses in the Czech Republic were used for microbiome analysis by Illumina amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. A laboratory RPM population was used as a positive control for transcriptome analysis by pyrosequencing with identification of sequences from bacteria. The congested adult/nymphal stage samples had 100-fold more copies of the 16S rRNA gene than the egg and larval samples. The composition of the microbiome showed differences between the four chicken coops and between the developmental stages observed. In the adult microbiome, 10 OTUs comprised 90-99% of all sequences. Bartonella-like bacteria covered 30-70% of the sequences in the RPM microbiome and 25% of the bacterial sequences in the transcriptome. Phylogenetic analyzes of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed two distinct groups of Bartonella-like bacteria that form sister groups: (i) ant symbionts; (ii) genus Bartonella. Cardinium, Wolbachia and Rickettsiella sp. were found in the microbiomes of all stages analyzed, while Spiroplasma eriocheiris and Wolbachia were identified in the laboratory RPM transcriptome. The microbiomes of swollen eggs, larvae, and adults/nymphs differed. Bartonella-like symbionts were found at all stages and sampling sites. Bartonella-like bacteria were the most diversified group within the RPM microbiome. The presence of identified putative pathogenic bacteria is relevant with respect to human and animal health issues, while the identification of symbiotic bacteria may lead to new control methods aimed at destabilizing the arthropod host.",,"Hubert, J.;Erban, T.;Kopecky, J.;Sopko, B.;Nesvorna, M.;Lichovnikova, M.;Schicht, S.;Strube, C.;Sparagano, O.",2017.0,Nov,,0

Phylogenetic comparison of the HA gene revealed a fairly homogeneous group with other local isolates from recent years, the A36R gene being mainly related to strains derived from elephants from Germany. Despite causing disease in humans, the AT/Carinthia/788/07 isolate surprisingly, even at high titers, showed greatly reduced virulence in BALB/c mice after intranasal inoculation compared to vaccinia virus. This is in contrast to previous reports on other CPXV isolates. Using shotgun DNA sequencing, several insertions and deletions were found in genes presumably involved in host range, immune regulation, and established virulence factors. These preliminary data could be an indication that CPXV strains with proven pathogenicity for humans may have reduced virulence in mice and vice versa. Furthermore, strains with reduced virulence may have the advantage of persisting in less dense rodent populations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Huemer, H.

849,Oral fluids as a source of live animal samples to assess cross-reactivity and cross-protection after intranasal vaccination against influenza A virus in pigs.,"Numerous antigenically distinct influenza A virus (IAV) H1 variants currently circulate in North American pigs, hampering vaccine development due to the inability to formulate a vaccine that provides broad cross-protection. Experimentally, live attenuated influenza virus vaccines (LAIV) demonstrate greater cross-protection compared to inactivated vaccines. However, there is no standardized test to predict cross-protection after LAIV vaccination. Serum hemagglutination inhibitor (HI) antibody is the gold standard correlate of protection after IAV vaccination. LAIV does not induce a robust serum HI antibody titer; however, a local mucosal antibody response is elicited. Therefore, there is a need for a live animal sample source that can be used to assess the immunogenicity and cross-protection of LAIV. Here, we evaluated the use of oral (OF) and nasal wash (NW) fluids collected after IAV inoculation as a sample source from live animals in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to predict cross-protection compared to non-infectious immunosorbent assays. traditional serology. Both live virus challenge and LAIV vaccination provided heterologous protection, although protection was greater against phylogenetically more closely related viruses. IAV-specific IgA was detected in NW and OF samples and was cross-reactive with representative IAVs from each H1 group. Cross-reactive IgA endpoint titers in OF from pigs challenged with live virus were associated with heterologous protection. Although the LAIV vaccine provided significant protection, the immunogenicity of LAIV was reduced compared to live virus challenge. These data suggest that OF from pigs inoculated with wild-type IAVs, with surface genes matching the seed strain of LAIV, could be used in an ELISA to assess cross-protection and antigenic relationship of circulating and emerging IAVs in pigs. .",,"Hughes, H.

850,The properties of the capsid protein of cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus and blackeye cowpea mosaic virus confirm the existence of two major subgroups of aphid-borne potyviruses that infect legumes.,"study of the capsid proteins of different legume-infecting potyviruses using specific monoclonal antibodies in immunoblots of crude extracts from infected plants revealed that cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CAMV) and cowpea blackeye mosaic virus (BlCMV) ) have coat protein M(r) values of 32K and 35K, respectively. Western blot comparisons of BlCMV, Peanut streak mosaic virus (PStV), Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), and Azuki bean mosaic virus (AzMV) revealed the same reactivity of their 35K coat proteins. . Similar comparisons between CAMV and the necrotic strain of BCMV (isolate NL3) showed a serological relationship between their 32K coat proteins, results that provide the first evidence of a possible similarity between CAMV and BCMV NL3. Peptides from trypsin digestion of the coat proteins of several of these legume-infecting potyviruses were analyzed by HPLC. Comparison of peptide profiles confirmed the serological results by distinguishing the two subgroups. The coat protein peptide profiles of BICMV, PStV, AzMV and BCMV were almost identical, suggesting that they could be considered strains of one virus. In contrast, the peptide profiles of various serotypes of CAMV and BCMV NL3 were distinct from the first group and showed limited similarities to each other.",,"Huguenot, C.;Furneaux, M.

Using biotin-labeled MAbs, B1CMV isolates were subdivided into two serotypes and CAMV isolates into five serotypes.

853,"Addressing global ruminant agricultural challenges through understanding the rumen microbiome: past, present and future","The rumen is a complex ecosystem composed of anaerobic bacteria, protozoa, fungi, methanogenic archaea, and phages. These microbes closely interact to break down plant material that humans cannot digest, while also providing metabolic energy to the host and, in the case of archaea, producing methane. Consequently, ruminants produce meat and milk, which are rich in high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals and thus contribute to food security. With the world population projected to reach approximately 9.7 billion by 2050, there is a need to increase ruminant production to meet global demand for protein, despite limited land availability, while ensuring the impact is minimized. environmental. Although challenging, these goals can be met but depend on our understanding of the rumen microbiome. Attempts to manipulate the rumen microbiome to benefit global agricultural challenges have been pursued for decades with limited success, primarily due to a lack of detailed understanding of this microbiome and our limited ability to culture most of these microbes outside of the rumen. of the rumen. The potential to manipulate the rumen microbiome and address global livestock challenges through animal husbandry and the introduction of dietary interventions during early life have recently emerged as promising new technologies. Our inability to phenotype ruminants in a high-throughput manner has also hampered progress, although the recent increase in ""omics"" data may allow further development of mathematical models and rumen microbial genetic biomarkers as surrogates. Advances in computational tools, high-throughput sequencing technologies, and culture-independent ""omics"" approaches continue to revolutionize our understanding of the rumen microbiome.

We used a metagenomics approach to examine the composition and diversity of viral communities in ballast water from ships originating in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, New York, and Panama, and in destination port water in Busan, Korea. Myoviridae was the most abundant virus family in ballast water, followed by Podoviridae and Siphoviridae. We also identified viruses that infect invertebrates, amoebae, and algae in ballast water and in Busan port water.

856,Molecular identification of three new herpesviruses found in farmed Australian saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) and captive Australian freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus johnstoni),"As part of a larger investigation into three emerging disease syndromes highlighted by conjunctivitis and pharyngitis, systemic lymphoid proliferation and encephalitis, and lymphonodular infiltrates in the skin of farmed saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) and an emerging systemic lymphoid proliferation syndrome in In captive freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus johnstoni), cytopathic effects (CPE), including syncytial cell formation, were observed in primary crocodilian cell lines exposed to clarified tissue homogenates from affected crocodilians. Ten CPE cell cultures were then screened for herpesviruses using two broadly reactive herpesvirus PCRs. Amplicons were obtained from 9 of 10 cell cultures and sequenced. Three new herpesviruses were discovered, and phylogenetic analysis of these viruses showed that there was a 63% Bayesian posterior probability value supporting grouping of these viruses with the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, and a 100% posterior probability of grouping with a clade containing Alphaherpesvirinae and other unassigned reptile herpesviruses. They are proposed to be named Crocodyline herpesviruses (CrHV) 1, 2 and 3. CrHV1 and 2 were only isolated from saltwater crocodiles and CrHV3 was only isolated from freshwater crocodiles. A duplex PCR was designed that was able to detect these herpesviruses in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, a sample type in which none of the broadly reactive PCRs could detect these herpesviruses. This work describes the isolation, molecular detection, and phylogeny of these new herpesviruses, but their association with emerging disease syndromes requires further investigation.",,"Hyndman, T.

857,Autochthonous hepatitis E in England and Wales from 2003 to 2012: Evidence for an emerging new virus phylotype,"Bottom. Since 2003, enhanced surveillance and molecular characterization studies of hepatitis E virus (HEV) have been carried out in England and Wales. The dynamics of hepatitis E have changed recently with an increase in the number of autochthonous cases and viral change observed. Methods. HEV RNA and antibody data were analyzed to determine the annual number of acute infections, HEV genotype arrangement, and viral phylogeny. These data were investigated in the context of collected travel history and demographic data. Results. In total, 2,713 cases of acute hepatitis E were diagnosed, of which 1,376 were autochthonous infections. Travel-associated cases remained stable and primarily associated with Genotype 1 infections. In contrast, significant fluctuations were observed in domestically-acquired cases with a dramatic year-over-year increase during 2010-2012. Molecular characterization showed that autochthonous infections are grouped into two distinct phylogenetic groups with the appearance of a new group of Genotype 3 viruses that coincides with the recent increase in cases. Conclusions. HEV infection rates are dynamic in England and Wales, influenced by changing trends in indigenously acquired cases. The recent increase in indigenous cases and the appearance of indigenous viruses that were not commonly circulating before 2010 suggest that the risk of acquiring HEV has changed.",,"Ijaz, S.;Said, B.;Boxall, E.;Smit, E.;Morgan, D.;Tedder, R.

Two samples out of 41 fecal samples collected for diagnostic purposes from diarrheal cattle in Aulendorf, Germany, tested positive for BEC. Samples were amplified with new degenerate BEC-specific primers, which amplify a 263 bp portion of the RNA polymerase region.

859,Herd immunity and fatal cases of influenza among the population exposed to poultry and wild birds in Russian Asia in 2013-2014,"In October 2013, a total of 1,525 blood serum samples were collected in Russian Asia from people residing in territories at high risk of emergence of influenza viruses with pandemic potential. The presence of antibodies against influenza viruses in sera was tested in the hemagglutination inhibition test. None of the samples were positive for A/H5 and A/H7 antigens. Twelve strains of influenza A(H1N1pdm09) virus were isolated from people who likely died from influenza during the 2013-2014 epidemic season. All strains were similar to the vaccine strain A/California/07/09 in terms of their antigenic properties and sensitivity to anti-neuraminidase drugs (oseltamivir and zanamivir). Genetic analysis revealed that all strains belong to group 6, subgroup 6B of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Substitutions in HA1: S164F add E235K, as well as E47G, A86V, K331R, N386K, N397K in NA and K131E, N29S in NS1 and N29S, R34Q in NEP separate the investigated strains into two groups: 1st group-A/Chita/1114 /2014, A/Chita/1115/2014, A/Chita/853/2014, A/Barnaul/269/2014 and 2nd group-A/Chita/655/2014, A/Chita/656/2014, A/Chita/ 709/2014, A/Chita/873/2014.

An exciting new subdiscipline of metagenomics considers the ways in which microbes, particularly those found in the gut, have facilitated the ecological and phylogenetic radiation of mammals. However, the vast majority of these studies focus on domestic animals, laboratory models, or charismatic megafauna (eg, pandas and chimpanzees). The result is a plethora of studies that cover few taxa in the mammalian tree of life, leaving broad patterns of microbiome function and evolution unclear. Wildlife microbiome research urgently needs a model system in which to test hypotheses about metagenomic involvement in host ecology and evolution. We propose that bats (Order: Chiroptera) represent an ideal model system for comparative microbiome research, providing opportunities to examine host phylogeny, diet, and other natural history features in relation to the evolution of the gut microbiome.",,"Ingala, M.

864,Identification and Characterization of Highlands J Virus from a Mississippi Sandhill Crane Using Unbiased Next-Generation Sequencing,"Advances in massively parallel DNA sequencing platforms, commonly referred to as next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, have greatly reduced the time, labor, and costs associated with DNA sequencing. Therefore, NGS has become a routine tool for the discovery of new viral pathogens and is likely to become the standard for routine laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases in the near future. This study demonstrated the application of NGS for the rapid identification and characterization of a virus isolated from the brain of an endangered Mississippi Sandhill Crane. This bird was part of a population restoration effort and was found in an emaciated state several days after Hurricane Isaac passed over the refuge in Mississippi in 2012. Post-mortem examination identified trichostrongyliasis as the possible cause of the disease. death, but because a virus with morphology consistent with a togavirus was isolated from the bird's brain, an arboviral etiology was strongly suspected. Because individual molecular assays for several known arboviruses were negative, unbiased Illumina MiSeq NGS was used to definitively identify and characterize the causative viral agent. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed the viral isolate to be Highlands J virus, a known avian pathogen. This study demonstrates the use of unbiased NGS for the rapid detection and characterization of an unidentified viral pathogen and the application of this technology to wildlife disease diagnosis and conservation medicine.",,"Ip, H.

865,Viral pathotyping and deep sequencing of the HA gene of a low pathogenicity H7N1 avian influenza virus causing mortality in turkeys,"Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses of the H7 subtype generally cause mild disease in poultry. However, the evolution of an LPAI virus to a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus results in the generation of a virus that can cause severe illness and death. Classification of these two pathotypes is based, in part, on signs of disease and death in chickens, as assessed in an intravenous pathogenicity test, but the effect of LPAI viruses on turkeys is less well understood. During an investigation of LPAI virus infection in turkeys, groups of three-week-old birds inoculated with A/chicken/Italy/1279/99 (H7N1) showed severe signs of illness and died or were euthanized within seven days. post infection. The virus was detected in many tissues and internal organs of slaughtered birds. To examine the possible evolution of the infecting virus to a highly pathogenic form in these turkeys, hemagglutinin (HA) gene cleavage site sequence analysis was performed by analyzing multiple cDNA amplicons made from swabs. and extracts from tissue samples using Sanger and Next Generation Sequencing. . In addition, an RT-PCR assay was developed to detect the HPAI virus. There was no evidence of the presence of HPAI virus in the virus used as inoculum or in swabs taken from infected birds. However, a small proportion (<0.5%) of the virus carried in individual tracheal or liver samples contained a molecular signature typical of an HPAI virus at the HA cleavage site. All signature sequences were identical and similar to HPAI viruses collected during the Italian epizootic in 1999/2000. We hypothesize that the detection of HPAI virus in tissue samples after infection with A/chicken/Italia/1279/99 reflected amplification of a virus present at very low levels within the mixed inoculum but, surprisingly, we did not observe new virus signatures.

The nucleotide sequence encoding VP1, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, from BD 3/99 aligned with that of 17 other IBDV strains, including six highly virulent, three classically virulent, five classically attenuated, one antigenic variant, and two serotype 2 strains. The VP1 genes of all highly virulent strains were 97.5% to 99.8% identical. With the exception of one Australian outlier strain, 002-73, all antigenic and virulent or attenuated classical variants were also 97.5% to 100% identical. Serotype 2 strains showed only 4-6% divergence from classical virulent or attenuated serotype 1 strains; in contrast, however, highly virulent strains diverged by 10.5% to 12.5% from classical virulent or attenuated strains, as well as from serotype 2 strains. Deduced amino acid sequence analysis of VP1 revealed 17 common amino acid substitutions, including 8 unique ones, in the highly virulent strains. In the phylogenetic tree, highly virulent strains formed a distinct group and all other strains, including classical virulent, attenuated, and antigenic variants, and even serotype 2 strains, clustered together. It is suggested that the highly virulent IBDV VP1 is phylogenetically distinct from that of all other IBDV strains and probably originated from a hitherto unidentified source.",,"Islam, M.

Since PoAstVs are detected in apparently healthy pigs, the clinical significance of the infection is unknown. However, AstVs have recently been associated with serious neurological disorder in animals, including humans, and a zoonotic potential has been suggested. To date, little is known about the epidemiology of PoAstVs among the pig population in Japan.

Based on phylogenetic analysis and pairwise sequence comparison, 10, 5, 15, and 6 sequences were classified as PoAstV2, PoAstV3, PoAstV4, and PoAstV5, respectively. Coinfection with two or three strains was found in individual fecal samples from eight pigs. The phylogenetic trees of ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 of PoAstV2 and PoAstV4 showed differences in their topologies. PoAstV3 and PoAstV5 strains shared high sequence identities within each genotype in all ORFs; however, one PoAstV3 strain and one PoAstV5 strain showed considerable sequence divergence from the other PoAstV3 and PoAstV5 strains, respectively, in ORF2. Recombination analysis using whole genomes revealed evidence for multiple possible intragenotypic recombination events in PoAstV2 and PoAstV4, suggesting that recombination might have contributed to genetic diversity and played an important role in the evolution of Japanese PoAstVs.",,"Ito, M.;Kuroda, M.;Masuda, T.;Akagami, M.;Haga, K.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Kishimoto, M.;Naoi, Y.;Sano, K.;Omatsu, T.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Aoki, H.;Ichimaru, T.;Mukono, I.;Ouchi, Y.;Yamasato, H.;Shirai, J.;Katayama, K.;Mizutani, T.;Nagai, M.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2017.02.008,1
870,Whole genome analysis of Japanese bovine toroviruses reveals natural recombination between porcine and bovine toroviruses,"Bovine toroviruses (BToV), belong to the Toroviridae subfamily within the Coronaviridae family, and are pathogens that cause enteric diseases in cattle. In Japan, BToVs are distributed throughout the country and cause gastrointestinal infections in calves and cows. In the present study, the full genome sequences of two Japanese BToVs and partial genome sequences of two Japanese BToVs and one porcine torovirus (PToV) from distant regions of Japan were determined and genetic analyzes were performed. Nucleotide pairwise comparison and phylogenetic analyzes revealed that the Japanese BToVs shared high identity with each other and showed high similarities to the BToV strain Breda1 in the S, M and HE coding regions. Japanese BToVs showed strong similarities to porcine toroviruses in the ORF1a, ORF1b, and N coding regions and in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions, suggesting a natural recombination event. Recombination analyzes mapped putative recombinant breakpoints to the 3' ends of the ORF1b and HE regions. These findings suggest that the cross-species recombinant nature of the Japanese BToVs resulted in a closer relationship between BToV Breda1 and PToV.",,"Ito, M.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Naoi, Y.;Otomaru, K.;Sato, M.;Masuda, T.;Haga, K.;Oka, T.;Yamasato, H.;Omatsu, T.;Sugimura, S.;Aoki, H.;Furuya, T.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Shirai, J.;Katayama, K.;Mizutani, T.;Nagai, M.",2016.0,Mar,,0

872,Novel bioinformatics strategies for predicting directional sequence changes in influenza virus genomes and for surveillance of potentially dangerous strains,"Background: With the remarkable increase in microbial and viral sequence data obtained from high-throughput DNA sequencers, novel tools are needed for comprehensive analysis of large sequence data. We have developed the ""Batch Learning Self-Organizing Map (BLSOM)"" that can characterize many, even millions of genomic sequences in one plane. Influenza virus is one of the zoonotic viruses and shows a clear tropism for the host. Important topics for bioinformatic studies of influenza viruses are predicting changes in genome sequence in the near future and monitoring potentially dangerous strains. compositions of mono-, di-, tri- and tetranucleotides in all genomic sequences of influenza A and B viruses and found a clear host-dependent clustering (self-organization) of the sequences. Results: Viruses isolated from humans and birds differed in the mononucleotide composition of each. Furthermore, oligonucleotide BLSOMs revealed host-dependent oligonucleotide compositions that could not be explained by host-dependent mononucleotide composition. Time-dependent retrospective directional changes of mononucleotide and oligonucleotide compositions, which were visualized for human strains in BLSOM, could provide predictive information about sequence changes in newly invaded viruses from other animal hosts (eg, pandemic H1N1 /09 derived from pigs). Conclusions: On the basis of host-dependent oligonucleotide composition, we proposed a strategy for the prediction of directional changes of virus sequences and for the surveillance of potentially dangerous strains when they are introduced into human populations from non-human sources. Millions of genome sequences of viruses and infectious microbes are available due to their medical and societal importance, and BLSOM can characterize big data and support efficient knowledge discovery. © 2013 Iwasaki et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Iwasaki, Y.;Abe, T.;Wada, Y.;Wada, K.;Ikemura, T.",2013.0,,10.1186/1471-2334-13-386,0

874,Molecular Characteristics of Infectious Bursal Disease Viruses from Asymptomatic Broiler Flocks in Europe,"Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) exists in several different antigenic and pathogenic forms. The immune suppression caused by this virus in young chickens is not always associated with clinical signs of disease. Antigenic variants of viruses originally described in the United States usually do not cause clinical signs of disease, but can cause marked immunosuppression through destruction of B lymphocytes. Using a transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR), we surveyed asymptomatic broiler flocks in Europe for IBDV. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the viral protein 2 (VP2) gene of four isolates from Spain and four isolates from France indicated that they may be different from the classical and very virulent (vv) strains of IBDV found in in all Europe. Nucleotide sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the hypervariable region of the VP2 gene indicated that all eight viruses were more similar to variant US viruses than classical viruses. In two viruses, one from France and one from Spain, threonine was observed at amino acid position 222 and serine at position 254. These two substitution mutations are characteristic of Delaware variant viruses. In addition, all eight viruses had amino acid position 318 mutated from glycine to aspartic acid, another substitution mutation commonly found in US virus variants. Although import restrictions prevented us from directly testing these viruses for antigenicity. , their predicted nucleotide and amino acid sequences suggest that they might be antigenically distinctive compared to classical and vvIBDV commonly found in Europe. Confirmation of the presence of antigenic variants of IBDV strains in Europe requires additional immunological studies to elucidate the exact nature of the viral epitopes. Our data support the need for these immunological studies.",,"Jackwood, D. J.;Cookson, K. C.;Sommer-Wagner, S. E.;Le Galludec, H.;De Wit, J. J.",2006.0,,10.1637/7528-032006r1.1,0
875,Genome segment B diversity of infectious bursal disease viruses in the United States,"Several phylogenetic lineages of the B segment of the infectious bursalitis virus (IBDV) genome have been identified. Although this segment of the genome has been shown to contribute to virulence, little is known about the genetic lineages that exist in the United States. The nucleotide genome segment B sequences of 67 IBDV strains collected between 2002 and 2011 in the United States were examined. Although they were from nine different states, the majority (47) of these viruses were from California. A 722 base pair region near the 5' end of genome segment B, beginning at nucleotide 168 and ending at 889, was examined and compared with sequences available in GenBank. Nucleotide sequence alignment revealed that mutations were observed frequently and were evenly spaced throughout the region. When the predicted amino acids were aligned, the amino acids at positions 145, 146 and 147 were found to change frequently. Six different amino acid triplets were observed and all very virulent (vv) IBDV strains (based on the presence of vvIBDV genome segment A sequence) had the T145, D146 and N147 triplet. None of the non-vvIBDV strains had this TDN triplet. Phylogenetic analysis of the 67-nucleotide sequences revealed four significant lineages of the B segment of the genome among US viruses. One included genome segment B normally found in vvIBDV and three contained non-vvIBDV genome segment B sequences. When sequences available in GenBank were added to the analysis, two additional lineages that did not contain US viruses were observed; one included viruses from China and the other contained viruses from Côte d'Ivoire. Although the samples analyzed do not represent all poultry-producing regions in the United States, all serotype 1 viruses from states outside of California belonged to a genome segment B lineage. The other three lineages observed in the United States were populated with viruses found exclusively in California, except for the serotype 2 lineage, where the type strain was a serotype 2 virus from Ohio. The data provide further evidence of the importance of genome segment B identification during routine molecular diagnosis of all IBDV strains. © 2012 American Association of Avian Pathologists.",,"Jackwood, D.

876,Different evolutionary trajectories of vaccine-controlled and uncontrolled avian infectious bronchitis virus in commercial poultry,"To determine the genetic and epidemiological relationship of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates from commercial poultry to live attenuated IBV vaccines, we performed a phylogenetic network analysis on the full-length S1 sequence for Arkansas (Ark) , Massachusetts (Massachusetts) and Delmarva/1639. (DMV/1639) virus type isolated in 2015 from clinical cases by 3 different diagnostic laboratories. Phylogenetic network analysis of Ark isolates showed two predominant groups linked by 2 mutations, consistent with the subpopulations found in commercial vaccines for this type of IBV. In addition, several satellite groups were observed surrounding the two predominant populations for Ark-like virus, which is likely due to mutations associated with the nature of this vaccine to persist in flocks. Phylogenetic network analysis of Mass-like viruses shows two groupings corresponding to vaccine sequences from different manufacturers. No satellite groups were observed for the Masstype viruses, which is consistent with the lack of persistence of this type of vaccine in the field. At the time of collection, no vaccine was being used for DMV/1639-like viruses and phylogenetic network analysis showed a sparse network suggesting no clear change in genetic distribution. Selection pressure analysis showed that the DMV/1639 and Mass-like strains were evolving under negative selection, while the Ark-like viruses had evolved under positive selection. These data support the hypothesis that the use of live attenuated vaccines plays a role in the genetic profile of similar IB viruses in the field and phylogenetic network analysis can be used to identify vaccines and isolates of vaccine origin, which is important. for our understanding of living paper. vaccines play into the evolutionary trajectory of those viruses.",,"Jackwood, M.

878,"Genetic analysis of avian influenza A viruses isolated from domestic waterfowl in live bird markets in Hanoi, Vietnam, prior to fatal human H5N1 infections in 2004","The first known cases of human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses in Vietnam occurred in late 2003. However, HPAI H5N1 and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N2 and H9N3 viruses were isolated of domestic waterfowl during live bird tests. market surveillance (LBM) in Vietnam in 2001 and 2003. To understand the possible role of these early viruses in the genesis of H5N1 strains that infect humans, we performed sequencing and molecular characterization. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the hemagglutinin (HA) genes of two HPAI H5N1 strains of geese belonged to clade 3, and their surface glycoprotein genes and replication complexes were more closely related (98.5-99.7% homologous). ) with A/duck/Guangxi/22/01 (H5N1), detected contemporaneously in southern China, while the M and NS genes were derived from a virus similar to A/duck/Hong Kong/2986.1/00 (H5N1) . The H5 HA gene of the duck strain HPAI H5N1 belonged to clade 5 and acquired a gene constellation of A/quail/Shantou/3846/02 (H5N1), A/teal/China/2978.1/02 (H5N1), and A/ Partridge/ Viruses similar to Shantou/2286/03 (H5N1). Phylogenetic analysis further indicated that all eight genetic segments of HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H5N2 viruses from geese and ducks were distinct from clade 1 H5N1 viruses known to have caused fatal human infections in Vietnam since late 2003. Isolates from duck H9N3 derived genes from waterfowl influenza viruses, and their H9 HA belonged to the Korean lineage. The PB2 gene of the A/duck/Vietnam/340/01 (H9N3) virus had lysine at position 627. Based on molecular characterization of specific amino acid residues on the surface and relevant internal protein-coding genes, the Vietnamese H5N1 virus and H9N3 isolates indicated avian cell surface receptor specificity and susceptibility to currently licensed influenza A virus chemotherapeutics. Our findings suggest that the H5N1 and H5N2 viruses that circulated among geese and ducks in LBM in Hanoi, Vietnam, during 2001 and 2003 were not the immediate ancestors of the clade 1 viruses associated with fatal human infections in Vietnam.

879,Genetic analysis of avian influenza viruses: co-circulation of avian influenza viruses with nonstructural genes of alleles A and B in reddish ducks (Anas acuta) wintering in Japan,"The 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), 1968 (H3N2), and 2009 (H1N1) pandemic influenza virus strains have genes related to avian influenza viruses (AIVs). The nonstructural (NS) gene of AIVs plays an important role in host-viral interaction. However, little is known about the degree of diversity of this gene in ruddy ducks (Anas acuta) wintering in Japan. This study describes the characteristics of the H1N1, H1N2, H1N3, H5N2, H5N3, H5N9, and H7N7 viruses originating from ducktail. Most of the viruses were revealed to be avian strains and unrelated to seasonal and pandemic influenza strains. However, the NP genes of 62.5% (5/8) of the viruses were found to be closely related to A/swine/Korea/C12/08, indicating exchange of genetic material and continued evolution of AIV linked to mammals. Furthermore, all viruses except Aomori/422/07 H1N1 contain the PSIQSRGLF motif that is generally found in avian, porcine, and human H1 strains. Aomori/422/07 H1N1 has a PSVQSRGLF motif identical to a North American strain. These findings were linked to a major intercontinental Asian-American biogeographical interface.

Virus isolation from allantoic fluid inoculated with tracheal aspirates and whole genome sequencing of two isolates were performed on an Ion-Torrent sequencer. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two H9N2 isolates are reassortant viruses showing a G1-like lineage for HA, NA and NP, a Hok/49/98-like lineage for PB1 and PA, a PK/UDL-01/ 05 for PB2, IL/90658/00-like lineage for NS, and an unknown lineage for the M gene. HA cleavage site analyzes showed a sequence of (333PARSSRGL340) indicating that these isolates are low pathogenic.

881,Emergence of a genotype I variant of avian infectious bronchitis virus in northern India,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the main causes of a persistent economic burden for poultry industries worldwide. IBV belongs to the Gammacoronavirus genus within the Coronaviridae family. IBV infection leads to respiratory and nephrogenic symptoms in broilers. In addition, its infection reduces the fertility and hatchability of laying birds. We determined the first complete genome sequence of an IBV variant from an outbreak in the state of Haryana, northern India, using next-generation sequencing. In the phylogenetic analysis of the IBV isolate, it was grouped with genotype I lineage 1 (GI-1). The deduced amino acid sequence of the S gene of the IBV isolates showed a high level of identity with the Tamil Nadu isolates and the reference vaccine strains. Our result suggests that the IBV virus isolated from unvaccinated chicken flocks in North India might be a revertant strain that originally evolved from the live attenuated vaccine strains used in the region.

The nature and molecular epidemiology of the NDVs that are prevalent in the recent outbreaks in India are poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize the NDV prevalent in vaccinated flocks in India using whole genome sequencing and biological pathotyping. Twelve field isolates were collected from outbreaks that occurred in different parts of India and were characterized as velogenic based on their intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and amino acid sequence at the F-protein cleavage site. The 12 field isolates and the five commonly used vaccine strains were selected for whole genome sequencing using Ion Torrent PGM technology, yielding complete genome sequences for ten field isolates and all vaccine strains. The genome of all isolates was found to be 15 192 nt long with a high level of conservation in multiple genomic features with APMV-I viruses. Phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary distance calculations placed the isolates into genotypes II, IV, and XIII. Review of other recently reported strains provided preliminary evidence for genotypes VI, VII and XVIII circulating in India. Comparison between field and vaccine virus sequences revealed single amino acid and genomic differences in important antigenic regions of the F and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) genes that can be targeted for site-directed mutagenesis to assess the impact of these differences. substitutions in virus pathogenicity.

884,Sequence analysis of the glycoprotein S1 gene of infectious bronchitis viruses: identification of a new phylogenetic group in Korea,"Twelve Korean infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs) were field isolated from chickens suspected of carrying infectious bronchitis between 2001 and 2003. The S1 glycoprotein genes of these IBV isolates were amplified by the reaction in reverse transcriptase polymerase chain (RT-PCR) and analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. These Korean IBV isolates were classified into three groups based on their RFLP patterns obtained using the restriction enzyme HaeIII. Half of the twelve isolates were similar to RFLP pattern KM91, which is a common pattern in Korea. Three more isolates were related to the pattern of Arkansas strains, but with some unique variations. The other three viruses showed variant RFLP patterns. For comparison with published sequences for non-Korean IBV strains, amplified PCR products from all twelve isolates were cloned and sequenced. Korean IBV field isolates had 71.2-99.7% nucleotide sequence homology to each other and 45.9-80.7% nucleotide sequence homology to non-Korean IBV strains. Regarding the deduced amino acid sequence, the Korean IBV isolates had 71.5 to 99.3% similarity to each other and 44.9 to 80.3% similarity to non-Korean IBV strains. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that some of the IBV isolates appear to belong to a new group, different from non-Korean IBV strains or previously isolated Korean IBV strains. Specifically, the new Korean IBV isolates K10217-03, K3-3, and K1255-03 represented a separate group. These findings suggest that Korean IBVs appear to be continually evolving.",,"Jang, J.

885,Genetic and antigenic analyzes of FMDV type A isolates for candidate vaccine strain selection reveal the emergence of a variant of the virus that is responsible for the most recent outbreaks in India,"Recent reports indicated the presence of two antigenic and genetic groups (genotypes VI and VII) of FMDV type A in India and they are different from the vaccine strains. To choose a suitable field isolate as a candidate vaccine strain, antisera against representative isolates of the genotypes and two vaccine strains in use are tested in a neutralization assay. Two candidate vaccine strains of both genotypes with close antigenic match to field isolates are selected. From the result it is evident that IND 81/00 (genotypes VII), gave a better antigenic coverage (antigenic ratio (r)-value >0.40 with 79% of isolates from 2002-2003) than IND 258/99 (genotype VI; r-value > 0.40 with 42% of the isolates from 2002-2003). Phylogenetic analysis based on the P1 genomic region placed all recent isolates (2001–2003) in genotype VII, with the appearance of a new virus variant (VIIb-VP359del) that has an amino acid deletion at an antigenically critical residue ( VP359), indicating an important evolutionary evolution. jump probably due to immune selection.

889,ViQuaS: An Enhanced Reconstruction Pipeline for Viral Quasispecies Spectra Generated by Next Generation Sequencing,"RATIONALE: The combined effect of a high replication rate and low fidelity of the viral polymerase in most RNA viruses and some DNA viruses results in the formation of a viral quasispecies. Uncovering information about quasispecies populations significantly benefits the study of disease progression, antiviral drug design, vaccine design, and viral pathogenesis. We present a new analysis pipeline called ViQuaS for spectrum reconstruction of viral quasispecies using short next-generation sequencing reads. ViQuaS is based on a novel reference-assisted de novo assembly algorithm to build local haplotypes. A significantly expanded version of an existing global stress reconstruction algorithm is also used. RESULTS: Benchmarking results showed that ViQuaS outperformed three other previously published methods called ShoRAH, QuRe, and PredictHaplo, with improvements of at least 3.1-53.9% in recall, 0-12.1% in accuracy, and 0-38.2% F-score in terms of warp sequence assembly and improvements of at least 0.006-0.143 in KL divergence and 0.001-0.035 in mean square error in terms of warp frequency estimation, over the next best algorithm in various simulation settings.

While the majority (approx. 95%) of the population harbored a duplication of a 222-nucleotide (nt) segment within the p7-NS2 coding region, the minority reflected the standard structure of a BVDV-2 genome. Furthermore, unusual mutations were found in both variants, within the highly conserved p7 protein and near the p7-NS2 cleavage site. Using a reverse genetics system with a BVDV-2a strain harboring a similar duplication, it was possible to show that during replication, unduplicated genomes are generated de novo from duplicated genomes. The major variant with duplication is compulsorily accompanied by the minor variant without duplication. RNA secondary structure prediction allowed analysis of the unique but stable mixture of three BVDV variants and also provided the explanation for their generation. Finally, our results suggest that the duplicative variant plays the main role in the highly virulent phenotype. IMPORTANCE: This study emphasizes the importance of deep whole-genome sequencing in combination with in-depth manual data analysis for virus investigation in basic research and diagnostics. Here we investigate recent isolates of highly virulent bovine viral diarrhea virus from a series of 2013 outbreaks. We discovered a unique special feature of the viral genome, an unstable duplication of 222 nucleotides that is ultimately removed by viral polymerase activity, leading to gives rise to an unexpectedly mixed population of viral genomes for all isolates investigated. Our study is of great importance to the field because we demonstrate that these insertion/deletion events enable another level of genome plasticity of positive-stranded RNA viruses, in addition to the well-known polymerase-induced single nucleotide variations that are usually they are considered the main basis for viral adaptation and evolution.",,"Jenckel, M.;Hoper, D.;Schirrmeier, H.;Reimann, I.;Goller, K.

891,"Identification of two new recombinant avian influenza a (H5N6) viruses in whooper swans in Korea, 2016","Background: On November 20, 2016, two new strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N6 were isolated from three whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) in Gangjin Bay, Guangdong province. South Jeolla, South Korea. The identification of HPAIV in wild birds is important as there is a potential risk of transmission of these viruses to birds and humans. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Gangjin H5N6 viruses were classified in the Asian lineage H5 clade 2.3.4.4 and distinguished from HPAIV H5N8 and H5N1 previously isolated in Korea. With the exception of the polymerase acid (PA) gene, the viruses were most closely related to A/duck/Guangdong/01.01SZSGXJK005-Y/2016 (H5N6) (98.90 ~ 99.74%). The PA genes of the two new Gangjin H5N6 viruses were most closely related to previously characterized AIV isolates from Korea, A/hooded crane/Korea/1176/2016 (H1N1) (99.16%) and A/environment/Korea /W133/2006 (H7N7) (98.65%). The lack of newer viruses for A/environment/Korea/W133/2006 (H7N7) indicates the need to test recent AIVs from wild birds isolated in Korea because they might provide further clues to the origin of these new reassortant H5N6 viruses. Conclusions: Although research on the origins and epidemiology of these infections is ongoing, the most likely route of infection for whooper swans was through direct or indirect contact with reassortant viruses shed by migratory wild birds in Korea. Since HPAIV H5N6 can potentially be transmitted to poultry and humans, continued monitoring of AIVs among wild birds will help mitigate this risk.",,"Jeong, J.;Woo, C.;Ip, H.

The enzymes are large proteins (approximately 120 kDa), their enzymatic activities are affected by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), they recognize similar asymmetric cognate sites and cleave at a distance of 11/9 nucleotides (nt). Enzymes exhibit similarities in their amino acid (aa) sequences and DNA catalytic motifs. Thermo sp. Enzymes are an example of functional aa sequence homologies between REases that recognize different but related DNA sequences. The family consists of the TspGWI and TspDTI subfamilies. TsoI appears to be a non-identical 'triplet', related to TspDTI and Tth111II/TthHB27I. The discovery of TsoI, purified from Thermus scotoductus, is described. This prototype, showing novel specificity, was determined by: (i) cleavage of a reference plasmid and bacteriophage DNA, (ii) cleavage of custom PCR DNA substrates, (iii) runoff sequencing of cleavage products and (iv) shotgun cloning and DNA sequencing of bacteriophage lambda (Î») digested with TsoI. The enzyme recognizes a degenerate 5'-TARCCA-3' sequence, while the DNA strands are cut 11/9 nt downstream.

RNA-seq transcriptome comparisons were performed, showing that 1928, 3219, and 2646 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between T3 vs. T0, T7 vs. T0, and T15 vs. T0, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) analyzes of DEGs from these comparisons revealed that ORFV could elicit a vigorous immune response from host cells during the early stage of infection. Furthermore, GO and network analysis showed that positive and negative regulatory mechanisms of apoptosis were integrated into host cells by upregulating or downregulating the expression level of DEGs involved in apoptotic pathways, in order to achieve a homeostasis of oral mucosal tissues during exposure. to ORFV infection. In conclusion, our study describes for the first time the direct effects of ORFV on the global host gene expression of its host using high-throughput RNA sequencing, providing a resource for future characterization of the mechanism of mammalian-host interaction. and ORFV.",,"Jia, H.;Zhan, L.;Wang, X.;He, X.;Chen, G.;Zhang, Y.;Feng, Y.;Wei, Y.;Zhang, Y.;Jing, Z.",2017.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0186681,0

900,Transcriptome analysis reveals dynamic changes in HEK 293T cells infected with coxsackievirus A16,"BACKGROUND: Coxsackie virus A16 (CVA16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) are two of the leading causes of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide. Although many studies have focused on infection and pathogenic mechanisms, the host cell transcriptome profile following CVA16 infection is still largely unknown. RESULTS: In this study, we compared the mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of CVA16-infected and uninfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells. We note that transcription of SCARB2, a cellular receptor for both CVA16 and EV71, was upregulated nearly 10-fold in infected cells compared to uninfected cells. CVA16-induced upregulation of SCARB2 transcription may increase the possibility of subsequent CVA16/EV71 infection, resulting in co-infection with two viruses in a single cell. This explanation would partly explain the cocirculation and genetic recombination of a large number of EV71 and CVA16 viruses. Based on the correlation analysis of miRNAs and genes, we speculate that the high expression of SCARB2 is modulated by the downregulation of miRNA has-miR-3605-5p. At the same time, we found that differentially expressed miRNA target genes were mainly reflected in extracellular membrane (ECM)-receptor interaction and circadian rhythm pathways, which may be related to clinical symptoms of CVA16-infected patients. , such as aphthous ulcers, cough, myocarditis, drowsiness, and potentially meningoencephalitis. The miRNAs hsa-miR-149-3p and hsa-miR-5001-5p may upregulate genes in these CVA16-related disease pathways and cause additional clinical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The present study elucidated the changes in 293T cells following CVA16 infection at the transcriptome level, which contain highly regulated SCARB2 genes in the ECM-receptor interaction and circadian rhythm pathways, and key miRNAs in the regulation of gene expression. . These results provided novel information on the pathogenesis of HFMD induced by CVA16 infection.",,"Jin, J.;Li, R.;Jiang, C.;Zhang, R.;Ge, X.;Liang, F.;Sheng, X.;Dai, W.;Chen, M.;Wu, J.;Xiao, J.;Su, W.",2017.0,01 25,,0

The complete genome sequence of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), isolated from Beijing, was determined by cloning sequencing and primer walking. The complete genome is 27,733 nucleotides long, has ten open reading frames: 5'-orf1a-orf1ab-s-3a-3b-em-6a-6b-n-3'. Genome sequence alignments of the IBV Beijing isolate were performed with those of two AIBV strains and a SARS coronavirus, respectively. The genome sequence of the IBV Beijing isolate compared to that of the IBV strain LX4 (unfilled, 19440 bp in size) was 91.2% similar. However, the complete genome sequence of the IBV Beijing isolate had 85.2% identity to that of the IBV Beaudette strain, and only 50.8% homology to that of the SARS coronavirus. The results showed that the IBV genome has a remarkable variation. And the IBV Beijing isolate is not closely related to the SARS coronavirus.

Detection of HEV-specific antibodies in rats and other rodents has suggested that these animals may represent an additional source for HEV transmission to humans. Recently, a new HEV (ratHEV) was detected in Norwegian rats from Hamburg, Germany, showing typical genome organization but large nucleotide and amino acid sequence divergence from other mammalian and avian HEV strains. Here we describe the multiplex detection of ratHEV RNA and HEV-specific antibodies in Norwegian rats from additional cities in northeastern and southwestern Germany. Whole genome analysis of two new strains from Berlin and Stuttgart confirmed the association of ratHEV with Norwegian rats. Current data indicated a continued existence of this virus in the Berlin and Hamburg rat populations. Phylogenetic analysis of a short segment of open reading frame 1 confirmed a geographic clustering of corresponding sequences. Serological investigations with recombinant rat HEV and genotype 3 capsid protein derivatives demonstrated antigenic differences that could be due to large amino acid sequence divergence in the immunodominant region. The large number of animals showing exclusively rat HEV RNA or rat anti-HEV antibodies suggested a non-persistent infection in the Norway rat.

910,Sequence analysis of the genome segment encoding VP6 of group F and G avian rotaviruses,"Rotavirus groups A through E are defined primarily by antibody reactivity to the VP6 capsid protein. In addition, two putative groups of rotaviruses (F and G) have been identified in birds. Here, we report the first nucleotide sequences of the genome segment encoding VP6 of group F (strain 03V0568) and group G (strain 03V0567) rotaviruses, both derived from chickens. Group F rotavirus is most closely related to avian group A and D rotaviruses, with 49.9-52.3% nucleotide and 36.5-39.0% amino acid sequence identity. Group G rotavirus is most closely related to mammalian group B rotaviruses, with 55.3-57.5% nucleotide and 48.2-49-9% amino acid sequence identity. Terminal genome segment sequences were similar in groups A, D, and F, and in groups B and G.

911,Epidemiology of rabies in southeastern Europe.,"Rabies remains endemic in several countries in southeastern Europe, including Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey. With the likely eastward expansion of the European Union, rabies elimination programs are likely to increase to reduce the disease burden in the new candidate countries. A clear understanding of the epidemiology of the virus in this area of Europe is vital before such programs are introduced. With the exception of Turkey, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the main reservoir of disease in southeastern Europe. However, cases of rabies in dogs (Canis familiaris) are periodically reported. Unlike in northern Europe, the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) does not appear to be a vector in the south. This study summarizes the current rabies situation in South-East Europe and demonstrates the phylogenetic relationships between the viruses in several countries in the region. Rabies virus RNA was extracted from the original samples and a fragment of the nucleoprotein gene was amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR. Automated sequencing was used to derive nucleoprotein gene sequences and these were used to prepare a molecular phylogeny of rabies viruses in southeastern Europe. In Bulgaria, the dog is the main contact vector of rabies with humans and livestock. However, other species can also act as reservoirs for the disease, complicating the development of elimination strategies. The fox is the main reservoir species for rabies in Romania, although cases in dogs are regularly reported. Despite a gradual decline in canine rabies, urban foci of the disease remain in many regions of Turkey. In addition, there is some evidence that the fox has been an important vector of rabies and may be responsible for the increase in rabies in cattle in the Aegean region of the country. Throughout the region there is evidence of transboundary movement of rabies by both wildlife and canine vectors.",,"Johnson, N.;Freuling, C.;Vos, A.;Un, H.;Valtchovski, R.;Turcitu, M.;Dumistrescu, F.;Vuta, V.;Velic, R.;Sandrac, V.;Aylan, O.;MÃ¼ller, T.;Fooks, A.

912,In-feed antibiotic carbadox induces phage gene transcription in the pig gut microbiome,"Carbadox is a quinoxaline-di-N-oxide antibiotic that is fed to over 40% of young pigs in the United States and has been shown to induce phage DNA transduction in vitro; however, the effects of carbadox on the functions of the porcine microbiome are poorly understood. We investigated the in vivo longitudinal effects of carbadox on porcine gut microbial gene expression (faecal metatranscriptome) and phage population dynamics (faecal dsDNA viromes). Microbial metagenome, transcriptome, and virome sequences were annotated for taxonomic inference and gene function by using FIGfam (isofunctional homologous sequences) and SEED subsystem databases. When the beta diversities of the FIGfam microbial annotations were compared, the control and carbadox communities were distinct 2 days after carbadox introduction. This effect was driven by carbadox-associated lower FIGfams expression (n = 66) related to microbial respiration, carbohydrate utilization, and RNA metabolism (q < 0.1), suggesting bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects within of certain populations. Interestingly, carbadox treatment caused increased expression of FIGfams related to all stages of the phage lytic cycle 2 days after carbadox introduction (q‰¤0.07), suggesting carbadox-mediated prophage induction and recombination. of the phage DNA. These effects diminished with 7 days of continuous in-feed carbadox, suggesting an acute impact. In addition, the viromes included some genes encoding resistance to tetracycline, aminoglycoside, and beta-lactam antibiotics, but these did not change in frequency over time or with treatment. The results show decreased bacterial growth and metabolism, induction of prophages, and possible transduction of bacterial fitness genes in bacterial communities of the pig intestine as a result of carbadox administration. SIGNIFICANCE FDA regulations on agricultural antibiotic use have focused on antibiotics that are important to human medicine. Carbadox is an antibiotic that is not used in humans, but is used frequently on US pig farms. It is important to study the potential side effects of using carbadox because it has been shown to promote bacterial growth, which could affect indirectly antibiotic resistance in bacteria of clinical importance. Interestingly, the present study shows higher prophage gene expression in feces from carbadox-fed animals than in feces from non-medicated animals 2 days after initiation of in-feed carbadox treatment. Importantly, the phage genetic material isolated in this study contained genes that could provide resistance to antibiotics that are important in human medicine, indicating that human-relevant antibiotic resistance genes are mobile between bacteria through phages. This study highlights the side effects of antibiotics and demonstrates the need to consider various effects of antibiotics whenever antibiotics are used or new regulations are considered.",,"Johnson, T.

913,Illumina MiSeq 16S Amplicon Sequence Analysis of Bovine Respiratory Disease-Associated Bacteria in Pulmonary and Mediastinal Lymph Node Tissue,"Background: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is caused by the growth of single or multiple species of pathogenic bacteria in lung tissue after stress and/or viral infection. Next-generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR amplicons (16S NGS amplicon analysis) is a powerful culture-independent open reference method that has recently been used to increase understanding of BRD-associated bacteria in the digestive tract. upper respiratory tract of BRD cattle. However, it has not yet been used to examine the bovine lower respiratory tract microbiome. The aim of this study was to use 16S NGS amplicon analysis to identify bacteria in post-mortem lung and lymph node tissue samples collected from fatal cases of BRD and clinically healthy animals. Post-mortem tissue samples were collected from the cranial lobe and corresponding mediastinal lymph node from calves diagnosed as cases of BRD by veterinary laboratory pathologists and from clinically healthy calves. Libraries of 16S NGS amplicons, targeting the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Quantitative information on microbial ecology (QIIME) was used to determine the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that corresponded to the 16S rRNA gene sequences. Results: Leptotrichiaceae, Mycoplasma, Pasteurellaceae and Fusobacterium were the most abundant OTUs identified in the lungs and lymph nodes of calves that died from BRD. Leptotrichiaceae, Fusobacterium, Mycoplasma, Trueperella, and Bacteroides had higher relative abundances in postmortem lung samples collected from fatal cases of BRD in dairy calves, compared to clinically healthy calves without lung lesions. Leptotrichiaceae, Mycoplasma, and Pasteurellaceae showed higher relative abundances in postmortem lymph node samples collected from fatal cases of BRD in dairy calves, compared to clinically healthy calves without lung lesions. Two Leptotrichiaceae sequence contigs were subsequently assembled from shotgun sequences enriched with bacterial DNA. Conclusions: The microbiomes of the cranial lung lobe and mediastinal lymph nodes of calves that died of RBBB and of clinically healthy calves with HF have been characterized. Contigs corresponding to the abundant Leptotrichiaceae OTU were sequenced and found not to be identical to any known bacterial genus. This suggests that we have identified a new bacterial species associated with BRD.",,"Johnston, D.;Earley, B.;Cormican, P.;Murray, G.;Kenny, D. A.;Waters, S. M.;McGee, M.;Kelly, A. K.;McCabe, M.

914,Identification of subtype H9N2 avian influenza virus in chicken farms in Indonesia,"Avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 (AIV-H9N2) has become established in domestic poultry in Asia and Africa. AIV-H9N2 has not previously been reported in Indonesia. Here we describe the presence of AIV-H9N2 in chicken farms in Indonesia. 99 cases were observed in various provinces of Indonesia. Clinical signs, pathological lesions and egg production were recorded. Confirmation was by virus isolation, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), and sequencing. To construct the hemagglutinin (HA) phylogeny, secondary data for Eurasian lineages were downloaded from GenBank. For neuraminidase, five sequences with the highest similarities to all sequences found in this study were downloaded. Phylogeny was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method in the MEGA6 package. Forty-nine positive cases for AIV-H9N2 were observed, of which 35 were positive for AIV-H9N2 only. The age of the infected chickens was 43.17 ± 16.56 weeks and their egg production was 35.85 ± 17.80% lower than before the outbreak. The BLAST search revealed that the nucleotide sequence of the HA-encoding gene identified in this study shared 98% sequence identity with that of A/Mallard duck/Vietnam/LBM719/2014(H9N2), while the coding gene sequences neuraminidase strains shared 94%, 98%, and 100% identities with three different influenza viruses. The phylogeny shows that the HA of AIV-H9N2 found in this study forms a distinct group with some sequence data from Vietnam and China. The NA sequence data form three distinct groups. We conclude that AIV-H9N2 is widespread in many provinces of Indonesia. To decrease economic losses to the poultry industry, flock biosecurity and vaccination against this virus subtype must be implemented quickly. Comprehensive and strict surveillance of AIV is essential to prevent further veterinary and public health consequences of the circulation of this virus in Indonesia.",,"Jonas, M.;Sahesti, A.;Murwijati, T.;Lestariningsih, C.

915,"Molecular identification and characterization of novel coronaviruses that infect wild geese (Anser anser), wild pigeons (Columbia livia) and mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos)","In light of the finding of a previously unknown coronavirus as the etiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), it is likely that other coronaviruses, in addition to those recognized to date, are circulating in animal populations. Presented here are the results of a coronavirus screening test, using a universal RT-PCR for coronavirus, from Greylag Goose (Anser anser), Wild Pigeon (Columbia livia) and Mallard Duck (Anas platyrhynchos) bird species. Coronaviruses were found in cloacal swab samples from all three bird species. In the greylag goose, 40 of 163 sampled birds tested positive for coronavirus, while two of 100 sampled pigeons and one of five sampled mallard ducks tested positive. Infected gray geese showed lower body weights compared to virus-negative birds, suggesting the clinical importance of the infection. Phylogenetic analyzes performed on the replicase gene and nucleocapsid protein sequences indicated that all novel coronaviruses described in the present study are derived from group III coronaviruses. All of the new avian coronaviruses harbored the conserved s2m RNA structure in their 3-inch untranslated region, like other previously described group III coronaviruses, and like the SARS coronavirus. Sequencing of the entire nucleocapsid gene and downstream regions of goose and pigeon coronaviruses evidenced the presence of two additional open reading frames for goose coronavirus with no sequence similarity to known proteins, but with transmembrane domains predicted for one of the encoded proteins, and one additional open reading frame for pigeon coronavirus, with a predicted transmembrane domain, downstream of the nucleocapsid gene. © 2005 SGM.",,"Jonassen, C.

916,Phylogenetic analysis of bovine pestiviruses: testing the evolution of clinical symptoms,"This study presents a phylogenetic analysis of 115 bovine pestiviruses. A sequence dataset was analyzed against the genomic 5' untranslated region with maximum parsimony, bootstrapping, and parsimony jackknifing. We tested the group's proposed classifications and analyzed the evolution of symptoms associated with Pestivirus infections in cattle. Based on the historical framework provided by our phylogenetic trees, we also characterize the extent and importance of contamination caused in biologicals by the virus. Our phylogenetic analyzes showed that the previously defined genotypes are monophyletic. except genotype 1a. Based on our cladograms, we propose the existence of more than 12 monophyletic groups within the BVDV 1 species. Mapping of clinical symptoms suggests that the appearance of some genotypes could have been driven by a change in the pathogenic process. Enteric problems seem to be ancestral, while reproductive and respiratory problems arise with the appearance of genotypes 1b, 1d and the Arg 1 genotype proposed here. The distribution of contaminating strains in the cladograms shows that pestivirus contamination is a common process and also suggests that a contaminated product may be a vehicle for virus dispersal. Implications for virus evolution, virus taxonomy, veterinary medicine, and biotechnology are discussed. (C) The Willi Hennig Society 2004.",,"Jones, L. R.;Cigliano, M. M.;Zandomeni, R. O.;Weber, E.

917,Homologous recombination in bovine pestiviruses - Phylogenetic and statistical evidence,"Bovine pestiviruses (Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus 1 (BVDV 1) and Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus 2 (BVDV 2)) belong to the genus Pestivirus (Flaviviridae), which is composed of positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause significant economic losses throughout the world. world. We use bootstrap and phylogenetic analyzes to systematically scan alignments of previously sequenced genomes to further explore the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for variation in the virus. Previously published data suggested that homologous crossing over might be one of the mechanisms responsible for the genomic rearrangements observed in bovine pestivirus cytopathic (cp) strains. However, homologous recombination involves not only homologous crossovers, but also the replacement of a homologous region of the acceptor RNA. Furthermore, cytopathic strains represent dead pathways in evolution, as they are isolated exclusively from fatal cases of mucosal disease. Herein, we report evidence of homologous recombination between genotypes in the genome of a noncytopathic (ncp) strain of bovine viral diarrhea virus 1, the type species of the genus Pestivirus. We also show that intragenotypic homologous recombination could be a common phenomenon in both Pestivirus species. This evidence demonstrates that homologous recombination contributes to the diversification of bovine pestiviruses in nature.

918,Occurrence of the virulence-associated substitution PB2 E627K in a fatal human case of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N7) virus infection as determined by Illumina ultra-deep sequencing,"Avian influenza viruses are capable of crossing the species barrier and infecting humans. Although the evidence for human-to-human transmission of avian influenza viruses to date is limited, the evolution of variants toward more efficient human-to-human transmission could result in a new influenza virus pandemic. In both the avian influenza A(H5N1) virus and the recently emerging avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, the E627K mutation of polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) appears to be of key importance for human adaptation . During a large outbreak of influenza A(H7N7) virus in the Netherlands in 2003, A(H7N7) virus isolated from a fatal human case contained the PB2 E627K mutation as well as a hemagglutinin (HA) K416R mutation. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether these mutations occurred in the avian or human host by Illumina Ultra-Deep sequencing of three previously uninvestigated clinical samples obtained from the fatal case.

920,Detection of fowlpox virus carrying different segments of the reticuloendotheliosis virus genome,"Fowlpox virus (FWPV), the type species of the genus Avipoxvirus, family Poxviridae, is a large double-stranded DNA virus that causes fowlpox in chickens and turkeys. In particular, the avian retrovirus reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) sequences are frequently found integrated into the FWPV genome. While some FWPV strains carry remnants of the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of REV, other strains have been shown to contain inserts of almost the entire REV provirus in their genome. In the present study, we detected heterogeneous populations of FWPVs carrying either the REV LTR or the nearly complete REV provirus genome in a Merriam's wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo merriami). The bird had papules distributed over the non-feathered areas of the head. Avipoxvirus-like virions were observed in the lesions by transmission electron microscopy and the presence of FWPV was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Metagenomic sequencing performed on nucleic acid extracted from skin lesions revealed two genomic populations of FWPV carrying either a 197 nt remnant of the REV LTR or a 7939 nt long fragment corresponding to the full-length REV provirus. In particular, PCR amplification with primers targeting FWPV sequences flanking the REV insertion site confirmed the natural occurrence of heterogeneous genomic populations of FWPV in an additional clinical sample from another fowlpox-affected turkey. Furthermore, sequencing of a historical isolate of FWPV obtained from chickens in the US in 2000 also revealed the presence of the two genomic populations of FWPV-REV. The results here demonstrate distinct populations of FWPV that contain variable segments of the REV genome integrated into their genome. These distinct genomic populations are likely the result of homologous recombination events that occur during FWPV replication.",,"Joshi, L. R.;Bauermann, F. V.;Hain, K. S.;Kutish, G. F.;ArmiÃ©n, A.

These viruses are currently classified in the new genus Henipavirus, within the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, family Paramyxoviridae. The genes encoding the HeV and NiV nucleocapsid proteins were cloned into the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression vector pFGG3 under the control of the GAL7 promoter. A high level of expression of these proteins was obtained (18-20 mg l-1 yeast culture). Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the primary structure of both proteins with 92% sequence coverage obtained by MS/MS analysis. Electron microscopy demonstrated the assembly of typical spike structures of purified recombinant nucleocapsid proteins, characteristic of other paramyxoviruses. The nucleocapsid proteins revealed stability in yeast and can be easily purified by cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation.

Five-day-old chick embryos were infected with this virus, and the chicks developed myeloid leukosis and hemangiomas within 2 months of hatching. To investigate the mechanism of pathogenesis, we employed high-throughput sequencing to analyze proviral integration sites in these tumors. We found expanded clones with integrations in the MET gene in two of the five hemangiomas studied. This integration locus was not observed in previous work characterizing ALV-J-induced myeloid leukosis.

924,Common Sites of Viral Integration Identified in Avian Leukosis Virus-Induced B-Cell Lymphomas,"Avian leukosis virus (ALV) induces B-cell lymphoma and other neoplasms in chickens by integrating into or near cancer genes and disrupting their expression. Four genes, MYC, MYB, Mir-155, and TERT, have previously been identified as common integration sites in these virus-induced lymphomas and are thought to play a causal role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we employ high-throughput sequencing to identify additional genes that drive tumorigenesis in ALV-induced B-cell lymphomas. In addition to the four genes implicated above, we identified other genes as common integration sites, including TNFRSF1A, MEF2C, CTDSPL, TAB2, RUNX1, MLL5, CXorf57, and BACH2. We also analyzed the genome-wide ALV integration landscape in vivo and found a higher frequency of ALV integration near transcription start sites and within transcripts. Previous work has shown that ALV prefers a weak consensus sequence for integration into cultured human cells. We confirm this consensus sequence for ALV integration in vivo in the chicken genome. SIGNIFICANCE Avian leukosis virus induces B-cell lymphomas in chickens. Previous studies showed that ALV can induce tumors through insertional mutagenesis, and several genes have been implicated in the development of these tumors. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to reveal the genome-wide landscape of ALV integration in ALV-induced B-cell lymphomas.

A total of 30 virus isolates obtained from 15 provinces of the country between 1997 and 2005 were included in the phylogenetic analysis. The virus isolates originated mainly from cattle with one isolate from sheep. All bovine isolates belonged to BVDV-1, the ovine isolate to BVDV-2. Fifteen isolates formed a new subgroup within BVDV-1, tentatively named BVDV-1l. The remaining bovine isolates were typed as BVDV-1a (n = 4), BVDV-1b (n = 4), BVDV-1d (n = 3), BVDV-1f (n = 2), and BVDV-1h (n = 1). ). Isolates assigned to BVDV-1l originated from various geographic regions in different years. There was no correlation between the genetic grouping and the places where the isolates were obtained. Viruses originating from one farm in most cases belonged to the same subgroup (n = 5). This study indicates that the recently detected BVDV-1l subgroup is predominant and widespread in Turkey.

These viruses were successively passaged in monocyte cultures regardless of the appearance of CPE. Cultures were assessed for infectivity at the third passage level using KSEK6 cells. Of the viruses examined, only Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) was able to propagate in monocytes. Four ADV strains, two virulent and two attenuated strains, were compared for their growth on two cell lines. The final amount of infective progeny measured at 72 hours incubation at 36.5 degrees C was almost in a similar order between 2 cell lines. However, the amount of infectious progeny produced at 24 hours of incubation was higher in SW/K99 cells than in KSEK6 cells. The appearance of CPE was also more evident in SW/K99 cells at early incubation. The data indicate that the viral susceptibility of monocytes to ADV is greater than that of epithelium.

929,Partial sequence of the avian adenovirus DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene: a reference panel for a general diagnostic PCR in poultry,"Adenoviruses are common infectious agents in different species of birds. Traditional serological typing of new isolates using virus neutralization tests is now in transition to be replaced by PCR and sequencing. The first PCRs, recommended for the detection of adenoviruses, had been designed to target the gene for the main capsid protein, the hexon. In birds, members of three different genera of the Adenoviridae family may occur. Consequently, three specific hexon PCRs had to be developed for the detection of adenoviruses in poultry. A significantly more sensitive PCR targeting the viral DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene has recently been described. This method proved to be an efficient alternative for the general detection of adenoviruses regardless of their genus affiliation. Avian adenoviruses (FAdV), isolated from chicken to date, comprise twelve serotypes classified into five virus species (FAdV-A to E). The polymerase gene sequence has yet only been determined from three FAdV types representing three species.

930,Japanese encephalitis in a 114-month-old cow: pathological investigation of the affected cow and genetic characterization of the Japanese encephalitis virus isolate,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is classified in the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. JEV can cause febrile illness and encephalitis primarily in humans and horses, and occasionally in cattle. In late September 2010, a 114-month-old cow presented with neurological symptoms similar to symptoms seen in previous cases of Japanese bovine encephalitis (JE); therefore, we perform virological and pathological tests on the cow. As a result, JEV was isolated from the brain of the affected cow. We determined the complete genome sequence of the JEV isolate, which we named JEV/Bo/Aichi/1/2010, including the envelope gene region (E) and the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). Our phylogenetic analyzes of the E region and the whole genome showed that the isolate belongs to JEV genotype 1 (G1). The isolate, JEV/Bo/Aichi/1/2010, was most closely related to several JEV G1 isolates in Toyama Prefecture, Japan, in 2007-2009 based on phylogenetic analysis of the E region. In addition, the nucleotide alignment revealed that the deletion in the 3'UTR was the same between JEV/Bo/Aichi/1/2010 and several other JEV G1 isolates identified in Toyama Prefecture in 2008-2009. A hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test for the detection of anti-JEV antibodies was performed in the affected cow, and the test detected 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) sensitive HI antibodies against JEV in the serum of the affected cow. . Histopathological investigation revealed nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis in the affected cow, and immunohistochemical assay detected JEV antigen in the brain. We diagnosed the case as JE from a cow based on the findings of nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis observed in the central nervous system, JEV antigen detected in the brain, JEV isolated from the brain, and 2-ME-sensitive HI antibodies against JEV detected in the serum. . . This is the first reported case of JE in a cow older than 24 months.",,"Kako, N.;Suzuki, S.;Sugie, N.;Kato, T.;Yanase, T.;Yamakawa, M.;Shirafuji, H.",2014.0,,10.1186/1746-6148-10-63,0
931,Genetic reclassification of porcine enteroviruses,"The genetic diversity of porcine teschoviruses (PTV; previously called porcine enterovirus 1) and most serotypes of porcine enteroviruses (PEV) was studied.

Sequences were obtained by RT-PCR and 3â€²-RACE with primers based on Talfan sequences and available PEV strains. Phylogenetic analysis of RdRp/VP2 and analysis of the predicted RNA secondary structure of the 3â€²-NTR indicated that PEVs should be genetically reclassified into at least three groups, one to be assigned to PTVs and two subspecies of PEVs represented by strain PEV-8 V 13 and strain PEV-9 UKG4 10/73.",,"Kaku, Y.;Sarai, A.;Murakami, Y.",2001.0,,,0
932,Influenza Vaccine Review,"Influenza viruses belong to the RNA virus family Orthomyxoviridae and are classified into three different types based on their main antigenic differences; Influenza A, Influenza B, and Influenza C. Influenza viruses cause annual, seasonal, and pandemic human epidemics. Seasonal influenza epidemics caused by influenza A and B viruses cause between 3 and 5 million severe cases and thousands of deaths worldwide each year. Influenza pandemics caused by influenza A viruses occur at unpredictable intervals. Influenza A virus will cause epidemics and pandemics due to its spread through migratory birds, pigs, horses and humans. Transmission can be from person to person via fomites, coughs, and sneezes. Pandemics are responsible for higher morbidity and mortality, compared to seasonal influenza. Four of these pandemics occurred in the last century, during 1918, 1957, 1968 and 2009. Influenza B only causes person-to-person spread with particular emphasis on the fact that no other hosts are involved, therefore no are involved in pandemics. Influenza C is a mild illness.[1] It causes seasonal episodes of influenza, such as northern infections, when they occur from September to March, while southern infections occur from May to September. Due to the variation of viruses responsible for infections in these two seasons; you need two different sets of shots. Influenza generally has an incubation period of 2 days, which ranges from 1 to 4 days.",,"Kalarikkal, S. M.;Jaishankar, G. B.",2018.0,1,,0

Virus 793/B IB is a major genotype of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) currently circulating in several countries, including Iran. One hundred confirmed IBV samples (between 2014 and 2015; from 15 provinces of Iran) were selected for genotyping based on S1 sequencing. After phylogenetic analysis, it was found that 30% of IBV isolates belonged to the 793/B genotype. The results showed that the 793/B-like Iranian IBV isolates could be divided into three groups: 4/91-like (50%), 1/96-like (40%), and IB88-like (10%). The sequence similarity between Iranian IBV isolates similar to 793/B is 87.69% to 100%.

934,Avian influenza (highly pathogenic) as a zoonotic agent,"The zoonotic agents that challenge the world each year are influenza A viruses. In the past, human pandemics caused by influenza A viruses occurred periodically. Wild waterfowl carry the full range of influenza A virus subtypes and therefore most likely constitute the natural reservoir for all influenza A viruses. their natural avian reservoir are generally low pathogenic (LPAIV), some have gained virulence by mutation after transmission and adaptation to susceptible gallinaceous poultry. So-called highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) cause massive deaths in susceptible birds and lead to huge economic losses when poultry are affected. In addition to several avian influenza virus subtypes that have sporadically infected mammals, HPAIV H5N1 Asia shows strong zoonotic characteristics and has been transmitted from birds to different species of mammals, including humans. Theoretically, pandemic viruses could be derived directly from avian influenza viruses or arise after genetic recombination between viruses of avian and mammalian origin. So far, HPAIV H5N1 already fulfills two conditions for a pandemic virus: as a new subtype it has not been seen so far in the human population and has infected at least 438 people, and has caused severe disease and high fatality in 262 humans to date. the date (August 2009). Acquisition of efficient human-to-human transmission would complete the emergence of a new pandemic virus. Therefore, combating H5N1 at its source is the prerequisite for reducing the pandemic risks posed by this virus. Other influenza viruses considered pandemic candidates are derived from subtypes H2, H7, and H9, all of which have infected humans in the past. Here, we will provide a comprehensive overview of avian influenza viruses in relation to their zoonotic potential. © 2009 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Kalthoff, D.;Globig, A.;Beer, M.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.08.022,0

From 60 to 200 plaque-forming units of virus were used against 20 antibody units of hyperimmune goat antisera prepared for individual isolates. The results established that these viruses were related to various degrees, but none were identical. Arrangements in the order of the largest reactions between groups produced essentially 1 serotype with the exception of 1 virus that showed 1-way neutralization reactions with heterologous isolates. The geographical origin, the site of viral isolation or the size of the plaque were not related to the neutralization pattern. The isolate F 9 that showed the highest intergroup reactions was proposed as a possible reference virus.

936,Evidence for co-circulation of enteric viruses in wastewater and in the population of Greater Cairo,"Objectives: To characterize the main enteric viruses (enteroviruses, rotaviruses, noroviruses, astroviruses, and adenoviruses) in Greater Cairo wastewater and compare the results with clinical data collected during the same period. Methods and results: Seventy-two wastewater samples from two wastewater treatment plants were collected from April 2006 to February 2007. Enterovirus, norovirus (NoV), and rotavirus (RV) were detected by RT-PCR in 22% , 18% and 8 3% of the samples, respectively. Adenoviruses and astroviruses were not detected. G2P[8], G9P[8], G1P[8], G2P[4] and rare isolates of RV G12 were detected in the environment as well as in a bovine RV. The environmental strains of NoV belonged mostly to genogroup I (84%). The rotaviruses and some of the NoVs were similar to those found in the clinical samples at the same time. Conclusions: Comparison of environmental and clinical data suggests that similar RV and NoV isolates were circulating in the environment and in the population during the same period. Importance and impact of the study: Few studies have investigated the prevalence and epidemiology of RVs and NoVs in Cairo.

938,"Nucleotide sequence of avian carcinoma virus MH2: two potential onc genes, one related to avian MC29 virus and the other related to murine sarcoma virus 3611","The 5.2 kilobase (kb) RNA genome of avian carcinoma virus MH2 has the genetic structure 5'-γgag (0.2 kg)-mhg (1.2 kg)-myc (1.4 kb)-c (0.4 kg)-poly)A) (0.2 kb)-3'. γgag is a partial retroviral core protein gene, mht and myc are cell-derived MH2-specific sequences, and c is the 3'-terminal retroviral vector sequence. Here we have determined the nucleotide sequence of 3.5 kb from the 3' end of Î´gag to the 3' end of the molecularly cloned MH2 proviral DNA, in order to elucidate the genetic structure of the virus and compare it with other mht- and oncogenic virus containing myc, as well as with the chicken proto-myc gene. The following results were obtained: (i) γgag-mht forms a hybrid gene with a contiguous reading frame of 2682 nucleotides ending with a stop codon near the 3' end of mht. The 3' 969 nucleotides of mht to the termination codon are 80% related in sequence to the onc-specific raf sequence of murine sarcoma virus 3611 (94% homologous at the deduced amino acid level). (ii) The myc sequence is preceded by an RNA splice acceptor site shared with the cellular proto-myc gene, beyond which it is colinear up to a 3' stop codon and 40 non-coding nucleotides with the avian retrovirus myc sequences MC29 and chicken. proto-myc. Thus, myc forms, together with a 5' retroviral exon, a second MH2-specific gene. (iii) myc is followed by the approximately 400 nucleotide 3' terminal c region, which is colinear with that of Rous sarcoma virus except for a substitution near the 5' end of the long terminal repeat. It is concluded that MH2 contains two genes with oncogenic potential, the γgag-mht gene, which is closely related to the transforming gene γgag-raf of MSV 3611, and the myc gene, which is related to the transforming gene of MC29. Furthermore, it can be concluded that cellular proto-onc genes, which after sequence transduction become viral onc genes, are a small group because among the 19 known onc sequences, 5 are shared by different taxonomic groups of viruses of which the mht/raf homology is the closest determined so far.",,"Kan, N.

Until 2010, HFMD was predominantly associated with enterovirus (EV) A71 and coxsackievirus (CV) A16 in Japan. In 2011, CV-A6 emerged as the primary causative agent, causing the largest epidemic of HFMD in Japan since 1981. Since then, CV-A6 has caused large epidemics of HFMD every 2 years. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral protein 1 (VP1) sequences revealed that most of the CV-A6 strains detected between 2011 and 2015 in the city of Osaka were classified into a different clade compared to the CV-A6 strains detected. between 1999 and 2009. The A6 strains detected in 2011 and most of the CV-A6 strains detected between 2013 and 2015 were mainly divided into two distinct genetic groups. Each epidemic strain carried unique amino acid substitutions in the putative DE, EF and GH loops of the VP1 protein that is exposed on the surface of the virion.

In this study, we provide a detailed characterization of the complete genomes of Egyptian H5N8 viruses and some virological characteristics. Genetic analysis showed that the Egyptian H5N8 viruses are highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the genome of the Egyptian H5N8 viruses was related to recently characterized reassortant H5N8 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4 isolated from different countries in Eurasia. Multiple peculiar mutations in Egyptian H5N8 viruses have been characterized, likely allowing transmission and virulence of these viruses in mammals. Egyptian H5N8 viruses preferentially bind to avian-type receptors rather than human-type receptors. Furthermore, Egyptian H5N8 viruses were fully sensitive to amantadine and neuraminidase inhibitors.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two H1N2 viruses, A/swine/Gunma/1/2013 and A/swine/Ibaraki/1/2013, were rearrangements containing genes from the following three distinct lineages: (i) H1 and nucleoprotein (NP ) genes derived from a classical porcine H1 HA lineage that circulates only among Japanese SIVs; (ii) neuraminidase (NA) genes from human-like H1N2 swine viruses; and (iii) other genes from pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses. The H3N2 virus, A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013, comprised genes from two sources: (i) hemagglutinin (HA) and NA genes derived from swine viruses human and human-like H3N2 and (ii) other pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 genes. Phylogenetic analysis also indicated that each of the rearrangements may have arisen independently in Japanese pigs. A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013 was found to have strong antigenic reactivities with antisera raised against some seasonal viruses of human lineage isolated during or before 2003, while A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013 reactivities with antisera against viruses isolated after 2004 they were clearly weaker. Furthermore, antisera against some seasonal H1 virus strains of human lineage did not react with either A/swine/Gunma/1/2013 or A/swine/Ibaraki/1/2013.

Of 1,528 fecal samples tested, 21 LP AIVs were isolated between 2007 and 2009. Nineteen AIV-positive fecal samples were identified as anseriform by DNA barcoding. The most frequently isolated subtype was H3 (61.9%) and the most prevalent hemagglutinin/neuraminidase combination was H3N8 (52.4%).

Results: Phylogenetic analysis of the eight viral genes revealed that this virus arose from genetic admixture between Eurasian and North American gene pools, and possibly between wild ducks and seagulls. The H13 and N2 surface genes were clustered in a cluster with Eurasian isolates from gulls and wild birds, respectively. The PB2, PA, NP, M, and NS segments belonged to the Eurasian lineage, while the PB1 gene clustered in the North American lineage. Furthermore, they showed a bird-dependent pattern in the phylogenetic analysis: the M gene was similar to H13 subtype viruses within gulls, while other segments were similar to avian influenza viruses of other subtypes from wild ducks. .

Genotype VII and genotype IX NDV viruses were the predominant circulating genotype in China, possibly responsible for disease outbreaks in chicken flocks in recent years. Whereas ducks and geese have generally exhibited inapparent infections. Methods. In the present study, we investigated the whole genome sequence, clinicopathological characterization, and transmission of two virulent Newcastle disease viruses, SS-10 and NH-10, isolated from domestic ducks in southern China in 2010. Results: F, and the complete gene Sequence based phylogenetic analysis showed that SS-10 (genotype VII) and NH-10 (genotype IX) belong to class II. The deduced amino acid sequence was <sup>(112)</sup>RRQK/RRF<sup>(117)</sup> at the fusion protein cleavage site. The results of animal experiments showed that SS-10 virus isolated from ducks was highly pathogenic for chickens and geese, but low pathogenic for ducks. It could be detected in the spleen, lung, kidney, trachea, small intestine, bursa of Fabricius, thymus, pancreas and cecal tonsils, oropharyngeal and cloacal smears, and could be transmitted to naïve contact birds. Also, it could be transmitted to chickens, ducks and geese by naive contact. However, NH-10 virus isolated from ducks could infect some chickens, ducks, and geese, but only killed chickens. In addition, it could be transmitted by naive contact with chickens, ducks and geese. Conclusion: The two NDV isolates exhibited different biological properties with respect to pathogenicity and transmission in chickens, ducks, and geese. Therefore, there is no species preference for viruses from chickens, ducks or geese and more attention should be given to the transspecific transmission of VII NDV between ducks, geese and chickens for the control and eradication of Newcastle disease.",,"Kang, Y.;Li, Y.;Yuan, R.;Li, X.;Sun, M.;Wang, Z.;Feng, M.;Jiao, P.;Ren, T.",2014.0,,10.1186/1743-422x-11-147,0
946,Phylogenetic and pathotypic characterization of Newcastle disease viruses circulating in southern China and transmission in different birds,"Although highly pathogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has been frequently isolated from poultry in China since 1948, the mode of transmission between bird species remains largely unknown. Since several wild bird species have been implicated as sources of transmission, in this study we genotypically and pathotypically characterized 23 NDV isolates collected from chickens, ducks, and pigeons at live bird markets (LBM) in southern China as part of a H7N9 surveillance program during December 2013 to February 2014. To simulate natural transmission from different types of animals in LBM, we selected three representative NDVs, namely GM, YF18, and GZ289, isolated from different birds to assess pathogenicity and transmission of the indicated viruses in chickens, ducks and pigeons. Furthermore, to investigate NDV replication and shedding in poultry, we inoculated chickens, ducks, and pigeons with 106 EID50 of each virus intraocularly and intranasally. Eight hours after infection, virgin contact groups were housed with those inoculated with each of the viruses as a means of monitoring contact transmission. Our results indicated that genetically diverse viruses circulate in LBM in Guangdong province, southern China, and that NDV from different birds have different tissue tropisms and host ranges when transmitted in different birds. Therefore, we propose continuous epidemiological surveillance of LBM to support the prevention of the spread of these viruses in different birds, especially chickens, and highlight the need for virus-host relationship studies.",,"Kang, Y.;Xiang, B.;Yuan, R.;Zhao, X.;Feng, M.;Gao, P.;Li, Y.;Li, Y.;Ning, Z.;Ren, T.",2016.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2016.00119,0

Restriction endonuclease analysis of the PCR product showed an ORF virus (ORFV)-specific pattern and the isolate reacted with monoclonal antibodies against ORFV. The partially deduced amino acid sequence of the viral envelope gene was identical to that of the major Japanese ORFVs. These results indicated that the outbreak was due to parapoxvirus infection.

These avian reoviruses were analyzed phylogenetically. and compared to avian reovirus sequences in the Genbank database. Avian reoviruses could be grouped into 5 different genotyping groups and this classification was identical when the sequences of the 5” end, the 3” end or the entire open reading frame of the ÏƒC protein were compared. Therefore, sequencing of any part of the gene encoding the ÏƒC protein appears to be reliable for classification. We were unable to identify a correlation between the ÏƒC sequences of avian reoviruses and the disease from which they were isolated. The sequences found in the Netherlands and Germany are, like those in Taiwan, more dispersed than the ÏƒC sequences of the known avian reovirus in the US and Australia.

Pig infection is usually subclinical, but HEV genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic agents that cause sporadic autochthonous cases of hepatitis E in humans. The objectives of this study were to investigate the occurrence and dynamics of HEV infections in young pigs by analyzing a total of 273 fecal samples collected from six farrowing farms, to genetically characterize the HEV isolates obtained, and to examine the phylogenetic relationships of the HEV isolates obtained. HEV isolates occurring in different pig farms in Finland. Fecal HEV shedding of individual piglets was followed on two farms that were selected from five farms identified as HEV RNA positive. HEV excretion was detected in 87.5% of the piglets during the survey. The piglets contracted the primary HEV infection 3-8 weeks after weaning, and at the time of their transfer to the fattening farms, practically all (96.6%) of the pigs from which a sample was available in at that time they were still excreting the virus. According to phylogenetic analysis, all HEV isolates obtained belonged to HEV genotype 3, subtype e, and a separate farm-specific isolate originated from 10 of 11 farms examined. The results of our study show that HEV infections are very common in young pigs, and HEV RNA-positive pigs allow transmission of HEV from farrowing to feedlots, creating a potential risk of infection for pig keepers. pigs, and that genetic variations in HEV originating from different farms occur.",,"Kantala, T.;Heinonen, M.;Oristo, S.;Von Bonsdorff, C.

950,Supersize me: how whole genome sequencing and big data are transforming epidemiology,"In epidemiology, identifying 'who infected whom' allows us to quantify key characteristics such as incubation periods, heterogeneity in transmission rates, duration of infectivity, and existence of high-risk groups. Although invaluable, the existence of many plausible routes of infection makes this difficult and makes epidemiological contact tracing uncertain, logistically prohibitive, or both. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing technology enables the identification of traceable differences in the pathogen genome that are transforming our ability to understand high-resolution disease transmission, sometimes even at the host-to-host scale. We review recent examples of the use of whole genome sequencing of the pathogen to trace transmission pathways through forensic analysis, focusing on particular problems where evolutionary dynamics must be supplemented with epidemiological information on the most likely timing of events. events, as well as possible routes of transmission. . We also discuss the potential dangers in over-interpreting these data and highlight how a confluence of this technology with sophisticated mathematical and statistical approaches has the potential to produce a paradigm shift in our understanding of infectious disease transmission and control. . © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Kao, R.

951,Next-generation sequencing technologies: a tool to study the diversity of avian viruses,"Increased globalization, climate change and the interface between wildlife and livestock have led to the emergence of new viral pathogens or zoonoses that have become a serious concern for avian, animal and human health. High biodiversity and bird migration facilitate the spread of the pathogen and provide reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Current classical diagnostic methods designed to be virus-specific or aim to be limited to a group of viral agents, make it difficult to identify new viruses or viral variants. Recently developed next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches provide culture-independent methods that are useful for understanding viral diversity and discovering new viruses, enabling better disease diagnosis and monitoring. This review discusses the different possible steps of the aNGS study using sequence-independent amplification, high-throughput sequencing, and bioinformatic approaches to identify novel avian viruses and their diversity. NGS led to the identification of a wide range of new viruses such as picobirnaviruses, picornaviruses, orthoreoviruses, and avian gamma coronaviruses associated with fulminant disease in guinea fowl and is also used to describe viral diversity among bird species. The review also briefly discusses areas of viral-host interaction and disease-associated causalities with newly identified avian viruses.",,"Kapgate, S. S.;Barbuddhe, S.

Chicken parvovirus (ChPV) and turkey parvovirus (TuPV) belong to the genus Aveparvovirus within the subfamily Parvovirinae. Avian parvoviruses are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses consisting of three open reading frames, the first two encoding nonstructural protein (NS) and nuclear phosphoprotein (NP), and the third encoding viral capsid proteins. 1 (VP1 and VP2). Unlike other parvoviruses, the unique region of VP1 does not contain the phospholipase A2 sequence motif. Recent experimental studies suggested that parvoviruses would be the candidate pathogens in cases of enteric disease syndrome. Current diagnostic methods for the detection of avian parvoviruses include PCR, real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant VP2 or VP1 capsid proteins. Furthermore, sequence-independent amplification techniques combined with state-of-the-art sequencing platforms have enabled rapid and simultaneous detection of parvovirus in healthy and affected birds. There is no commercial vaccine; therefore, the development of an effective vaccine to control the spread of infection must be of paramount importance.

953,Multiple novel astrovirus species in human feces,"Diarrhea remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries, where many cases remain without identified etiology. Astroviruses are a recently identified cause of animal gastroenteritis that currently includes two species suspected of causing human diarrhoea. Using pan-astrovirus RT-PCR, we analyzed human stool samples from different continents for astrovirus-related RNA sequences. We identified variants of the two known human astrovirus species plus, based on genetic distance criteria, three new astrovirus species, all distantly related to mink and sheep astroviruses, which we tentatively named HMOAstV AC species. The complete genome of species A showed all the conserved features of mammalian astroviruses. Each of the three groups of astroviruses now found in human feces (HAstV, AstV-MLB, and HMOAstV) were more closely related to animal astroviruses than to each other, indicating that human astroviruses may periodically arise from zoonotic transmissions. . Based on the pathogenic impact of its closest phylogenetic relatives in animals, further investigations of the role of HMOAstV, so far detected in Nigeria, Nepal, and Pakistan, in human gastroenteritis are warranted. © 2009 SGM.",,"Kapoor, A.;Li, L.;Victoria, J.;Oderinde, B.;Mason, C.;Pandey, P.;Zaidi, S.

Thirty-seven additional viruses recorded up to June 1970 were published in a supplement in November 1970. A second update supplement was published in November 1971, with 14 newly recorded viruses. A second edition of the Catalog was published in 1975, containing information on 359 viruses recorded in the Working Catalog in December 1974. The present report comprises the first supplement to the second published edition of the Catalog and includes an additional 30 virus records. With the retraction of the Samford virus, which was determined to be an Aino virus strain, the number of registered viruses now stands at 388. The 30 new records in this supplement contain information on 17 viruses isolated from arthropods, 2 isolates from humans and 11 isolated from other vertebrates. The two human viruses (ROC, EBO) have been associated with serious human illness. One of the arthropod isolates (ORU) and a virus isolated from a mule (VSA) have also been implicated in human disease, and SSH virus from a hare has been shown to cause subclinical infections in man. Three viruses (BEF, IBA, VSA), isolated from cattle and a mule, cause extensive disease in domestic animals.

957,A Novel Method for Multiplexed Target Enrichment of MinION Next-Generation Sequencing Libraries Using PCR-Generated Primers,"Enrichment of target regions within complex next-generation sequencing libraries commonly uses biotinylated primers to capture the desired sequences. This method results in high read coverage over the targets and their adjacent regions. Oxford Nanopore Technologies recently released a USB3.0 interface sequencer, the MinION. To date, no particular method of enriching MinION libraries has been standardized. Here, using biotinylated PCR-generated primers in a novel approach, we describe a simple and efficient way for multiplexed enrichment of MinION libraries, overcoming technical limitations related to sequencing adapter chemistry and DNA fragment length. Using Phage Lambda and Escherichia coli as models, we selectively enriched for specific targets, significantly increasing the corresponding read coverage, removing unwanted regions. We show that by capturing genomic fragments, which contain the target sequences, we recover reads that extend target regions and thus can be used for the determination of potentially unknown flanking sequences. By pooling enriched libraries derived from two different E. coli strains and testing them in parallel, we demonstrate the efficiency of this method in a multiplexed format. Crucially, we evaluate the optimal bait size for large fragment libraries and describe for the first time a standardized method for target enrichment on the MinION platform.",,"Karamitros, T.;Magiorkinis, G.",2015.0,2015-12-01 00:00:00,,0
958,"Genetic characterization of H3N2 influenza viruses isolated from pigs in North America, 1977-1999: Evidence for fully human and reassortant virus genotypes","Since 1998, H3N2 viruses have caused epizootics of respiratory disease in swine in major hog-producing regions of the US These outbreaks are notable because swine influenza in North America had previously been caused almost exclusively by H1N1 viruses. We sequenced the full-length protein-coding regions of the eight RNA segments of four H3N2 viruses that we isolated from pigs in the US Midwest between March 1998 and March 1999, as well as from H3N2 viruses recovered from a piglet. in Canada in January 1997 from a pig in Colorado in 1977.

960,The eukaryotic intestinal virome in healthy and diarrheal neonatal piglets,"Neonatal swine diarrhea of uncertain aetiology has been reported in several European countries. The aim of the present study was to use viral metagenomics to examine a possible viral involvement in this diarrhea and to describe the intestinal virome focusing on eukaryotic viruses. Distal jejunum samples from 50 diarrheal and 19 healthy piglets from 10 affected herds were analyzed. The viral fraction of the samples was isolated and the nucleic acids (RNA and DNA fractions) were subjected to sequence-independent amplification. Samples from piglets with diarrhea from the same herds were pooled, while samples from healthy piglets were analyzed individually. In total, 29 clinical samples were sequenced, plus two negative controls and one positive control consisting of a simulated metagenome using the Ion Torrent platform. The resulting sequence data was subjected to taxonomic classification using Kraken, Diamond, and HMMER. Eight different families of mammalian viruses (Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae) were detected in the healthy specimens compared to four in the pooled diarrheal samples (Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae). It was not possible to associate a particular virus family with the investigated diarrhea. In conclusion, this study does not support the hypothesis that the investigated diarrhea was caused by known mammalian viruses. However, the results indicate that known mammalian viruses were present in the intestine as early as 24 to 48 hours after birth, indicating immediate postpartum infection or possibly transplacental infection.",,"Karlsson, O.

962,Understanding the evolutionary relationship of the hemagglutinin protein of influenza viruses through phylogenetic and molecular model studies,"The existing H1N1 (2009) swine flu is pandemic in nature and is responsible for economic losses and deaths globally. Among the eight gene segments of H1N1, hemagglutinin (HA) plays an important role in binding of the virus to the host cell surface and entry of viral RNA into the host cell leading to infection. In this study, the sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the HA H1N1 (2009) from Mexico City were studied together with sequences from 1952 of different subtypes of the pandemic influenza A virus and the results showed that the closest relationship of the strain H1N1 (2009) Mexico was with the strain H1N1 (2007) Mallard Norway. Analysis of secondary structures predicted from the protein sequence revealed that a decrease in alpha helices was observed in many areas of the sequences between the years 2005 and 2010. In contrast, analysis at the structural level is necessary to critically evaluate the functional importance. Therefore, a structural level investigation was performed for such proteins by constructing the 3D structure of these proteins through homology modeling. The models were validated and the similarities at the structural level were evaluated by means of superposition. Subsequently, docking studies were performed to find the binding mode of sialic acid (SA) with influenza HA. Molecular dynamics simulations were run to study the interactions of the SA molecule with HA. Energetic analysis reveals that the van der Waal interaction is more favorable for the binding of HA with SA from all influenza viruses.

963,Potential risks posed by pig single-stranded DNA viruses associated with xenotransplantation,"Routine large-scale xenotransplantation from pigs to humans is moving closer to clinical reality due to several state-of-the-art technologies, especially the ability to rapidly engineer genetically defined pigs. However, the use of pig organs in humans presents risks, including unwanted interspecies virus transfer and adaptation of these pig viruses to the human organ host. Recent developments in the field of virology, including the advent of metagenomic techniques to characterize whole viromes, have led to the identification of a plethora of viruses in many niches. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are the largest group prevalent in mammalian virome studies. Specifically, ssDNA viral genomes are characterized by a high rate of nucleotide substitution, giving them a propensity to adapt to new hosts and species barriers. Swine-associated ssDNA viruses include torque tenosus virus (TTSuV) in the family Anelloviridae, porcine parvovirus (PPV) and porcine bocavirus (PBoV) both in the family Parvoviridae, and porcine circovirus (PCV) in the family Circoviridae, some of which they have been confirmed to be pathogenic for pigs. The risks of these viruses to the human recipient during xenotransplantation procedures are relatively unknown. Based on the limited knowledge available on the prevalence, predilection, and pathogenicity of ssDNA viruses associated with pigs, careful detection and monitoring is required. In the event of a positive identification, risk assessments and strategies to eliminate these viruses in xenograft pigs may be needed.",,"Karuppannan, A.

The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the gene were highly conserved among the Japanese strains, regardless of the year of isolation, and were closely related to the Taiwanese strains. By phylogenetic analysis, the Japanese and Taiwanese strains were clearly classified into three chronological groups: 1966, 1984-1989, and 1996-2004, indicating that epidemics of ephemeral bovine fever can occur almost simultaneously in both countries due to the same genotype. On the other hand, the Australian strains were distantly related to these East Asian strains and placed in the fourth independent group on the phylogenetic tree. Three amino acid substitutions at residues 224, 271, and 499 in the neutralizing epitopes, of which two generate new glycosylation sequences, are suggested to be responsible for the antigenic variations of bovine ephemeral fever virus.

(VP6) of these AvRV species. The results confirm that evolutionary characteristics influence rotavirus (RV) genetic diversity and the impact of host natural selection on AvRV codons. Synonymous codon usage patterns were evaluated following multivariate statistical procedures on all available AvRV-encoding gene sequences. The RSCU trees accommodated all AvRV species and host-preferred sequences in a topology confirming greater connexion of AvRVs with host chicken cell genes. Similarly, the codon adaptation index (CAI) results also showed a higher adaptation of the AvRVs to their chicken host. Codon preference analysis of RV revealed that the VP6 gene is more efficiently expressed in the yeast system, whereas codon optimization might be required for efficient expression in Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens. The findings provide basic evidence on the dynamics of AvRV evolution and its host adaptation, which could be exploited for additional research on bird species in the future.",,"Kattoor, J.

A combination of PCR and sequencing was used to determine the prevalence and distribution of CRISPR arrays in Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus hirae isolates from feces of healthy pigs. Both type II CRISPR-Cas and orphan CRISPR (without Cas genes) were detected in all 195 isolates examined.

Only two spacers matched previously characterized pig virome sequences, and many were apparently derived from enterococcal chromosomal sequences. Surprisingly, 17 (40%) of the spacers were detected in both species. Shared spacer sequences are evidence of a lack of species-specificity in the agents and mechanisms responsible for spacer integration, and the abundance of spacer sequences corresponding to bacterial chromosomal sequences reflects interspecific interactions within the gut microbiota.",,"Katyal, I.;Chaban, B.;Ng, B.;Hill, J.

Plasmids often serve as mediators of lateral gene transfer, a process that is considered a strong and shaping evolutionary force in microbial environments. Our goal was to characterize the general population of plasmids in the bovine rumen environment, which harbors a complex and dense microbiota that is of enormous importance to humans. We developed a procedure for the isolation of total plasmid DNA from the rumen, termed rumen plasmidome, and subjected it to deep sequencing using the Illumina protocol and paired-end analysis with public and custom bioinformatics tools. A large number of plasmidome contigs aligned with plasmids from rumen bacteria isolated from different locations and at various times, suggesting that not only bacterial taxa, but also their plasmids, are defined by ecological niche. The distribution of the bacterial phylum of the plasmidome was different from that of the rumen bacterial taxa. However, both shared a dominance of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. Evidently, the rumen plasmidome is highly mosaic in nature that can cross phyla. Interestingly, when we compared the functional profile of the rumen plasmidoma with two recently published plasmid databases and two rumen metagenomes, it became clear that the rumen plasmidoma encodes functions that are enriched in the rumen ecological niche and could confer advantages to rumens. your guests. suggesting that the functional profiles of mobile genetic elements are associated with their environment, as has been previously implied for viruses.",,"Kav, A.

All NDV isolates in this study exhibited a high intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI), all were classified as velogenic type of NDV. Viruses of sub-subgenotype VIIe2 and VIIe4 are now dominant and have been implicated in most of the recent ND outbreaks in Taiwan. Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates revealed that they may have evolved from previously reported local strains (VIIe1).

971,Baculovirus infection of fall armyworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) that feeds on leaves of thorny or smooth-edged grass (Festuca spp.),"The susceptibility of the fall armyworm, Mythimna unipuncta (Haworth), to infection by a baculovirus (NPV) isolated from a Kentucky fall armyworm population was compared with two putative parents of tall fescue, Festuca mairei and Festuca arundinacea subsp. fenas, with the spinous leaf margins intact or removed to test whether the leaf spines abrade or perforate the peritrophic matrix (PM) and facilitate passage of virions to sites of infection in the midgut tissue. PCR amplification and sequencing of selected virus genes and phylogenetic inference from aligned sequences were performed to identify and classify the virus. Edge spines had no effect on percent infection or days to death of freshly molted fifth instars fed F. mairei leaf blades with spiny or smooth edges for 24 h before and after feeding. with drop doses of 10 (8) or 10 (9) OBs ml (1). Fifth instars fed spiny or smooth-edged grass blades had similar undamaged PM when viewed with a scanning electron microscope. The fourth instars fed on F. arundinacea subsp. Leaf blades of fenas with intact or removed spiny edges did not differ in proportion infected or days to death. The food bolus moves in a liquid medium within the PM, and fecal dissections showed that edge spines were often located within a food bolus separated from the PM by non-thorny plant material rather than contiguous with the PM. ; therefore, the friction of the edge spines with the PM may have been low. These results suggest that armyworms will be no less susceptible to baculovirus infection when feeding on tall fescue cultivars with smooth leaf margins planted to improve livestock performance compared with those feeding on standard cultivars with spiny margins. We believe that this is the first study to investigate the effects of a natural physical structure on PM disruption and baculovirus infection. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

972,Genetic variability of porcine circovirus 2 in commercial vaccinating and non-vaccinating farms,"Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) vaccines are now widely used to control diseases caused by the virus. Although the vaccines protect pigs against the disease, they do not lead to sterilizing immunity and therefore PCV2 infections continue on farms. Due to its high rate of evolution, PCV2 is expected to be able to rapidly adapt to environmental pressures such as vaccination. The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular variation of PCV2 in relation to vaccination. The variability of PCV2 was investigated from samples of infected pigs from five farms where vaccination had never been applied and two farms where pigs had been vaccinated for at least 2 years. For genetic analysis, complete PCV2 genomes were amplified and subsequently pooled by vaccination status from sera from eight infected vaccinated pigs and 16 infected unvaccinated pigs. The variability of viral populations was quantified by next-generation sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis. The number of segregation sites was similar in the unvaccinated (n=109) and vaccinated (n=96) groups, but the distribution of these sites in the genome differed. In particular, in the capsid gene, the number of segregation sites was observed only in the unvaccinated population. Based on structural analysis, some low-frequency amino acids are expected to result in biologically unfit viruses. In contrast, D294 in the replicase represents a new amino acid that was dominant and unique in the vaccinated group. This work showed that variable populations of PCV2 circulated in commercial farms, and that this variability was different in samples obtained from vaccinating and non-vaccinating farms.",,"Kekarainen, T.;Gonzalez, A.;Llorens, A.;Segales, J.",2014.0,Aug,,0

Caliciviruses are important human and animal pathogens and, as has been seen with human noroviruses, can impact human health on a global scale. When examining faecal samples from bats in Hungary, calicivirus RNA was identified in samples from bats Myotis daubentonii and Eptesicus serotinus. To further characterize bat caliciviruses, large portions of the viruses' genome sequences were determined. Phylogenetic analyzes and molecular modeling strongly identified the two viruses as candidate members within the family Caliciviridae, with one strain of calicivirus resembling members of the genus Sapovirus and the other bat calicivirus being more closely related to swine caliciviruses. proposed genus Valovirus.

Selected regions of the PPRV genome were amplified from clinical samples collected from 32 sheep and goats by RT-PCR and the resulting amplicons sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic tree based on PPRV 322 bp F gene sequences from five different loci grouped them in lineage 4 along with other Asian isolates. While the 425 bp N gene sequences revealed a different pattern of branching, yielding three distinct clusters for the Nigerian, Turkish and Indian isolates.

The virus is transmitted only between animals and mainly by the bite of mosquitoes of the genus Culicoides. This study was carried out in order to determine the genetic diversity of SBV and elucidate host-vector adaptation. All three viral segments were analyzed for sequence variability and phylogenetic relationships. Polish SBV strains obtained from acute infections in cattle, congenital cases in sheep, and from Culicoides mosquitoes were sequenced using Sanger and next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods. The sequences obtained were genetically similar (99.2-100% identity) to the BH80/11-4 strain first detected from German cattle. The year of sampling and the origin of the Polish sequences had no effect on the molecular diversity of SBV. Considering all the Polish and European sequences analysed, the sheep-derived sequences were the most variable, while the mosquito-derived ones were more conserved and encompassed unique substitutions located mainly in the nonstructural protein S.

978,Epidemiology of human and animal kobuviruses,"Kobuviruses are members of the Picornaviridae family. Initially, members of the Kobuvirus genus were named according to the host species. Viruses found in humans are called “Aichi viruses”, viruses from cattle are called “bovine kobuvirus”, and viruses isolated from pigs are called “porcine kobuvirus”. Currently, the taxonomy of kobuviruses has been proposed and the virus species have been renamed. ""Aichi virus"" has been renamed ""Aichivirus A"", ""bovine kobuvirus"" has been renamed ""Aichivirus B"", and ""porcine kobuvirus"" has been renamed ""Aichivirus C"". Among Aichivirus A, three distinct members have been described, including Aichi virus 1 (Aichivirus in humans), canine kobuvirus 1, and murine kobuvirus 1. Aichi virus 1 in humans is globally distributed and has been identified with a low incidence (0 -3%) in sporadic cases of acute gastroenteritis. Aichi virus 1 has been reported to be associated with various types of clinical illness including diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, purulent conjunctivitis and respiratory symptoms. Studies from Japan, Spain, Germany and Tunisia showed that a high prevalence of Aichi virus 1 antibodies was found in the populations. Aichivirus B or previously known as bovine kobuvirus was first reported in 2003. Since then, Aichivirus B has also been reported in several countries around the world. The overall prevalence of Aichivirus B ranges from 1 to 34.5%, with the highest prevalence found in cattle with diarrhea in Korea. Aichivirus C or porcine kobuvirus is widely distributed in pigs. Aichivirus C has been found in both diarrheal and healthy pigs and the positivity rate for this virus ranges from 3.9 to 100%. Aichivirus C was reported to be found in high prevalence in wild boar in Hungary. Accumulated data from biological, pathological, and epidemiological studies of kobuviruses are still limited. Comprehensive global investigations of prevalence and diversity are required and will be useful in gaining more information on the pathogenicity, genetic heterogeneity, interspecies transmission, and global distribution of kobuviruses.",,"Khamrin, P.;Maneekarn, N.;Okitsu, S.;Ushijima, H.",2014.0,,10.1007/s13337-014-0200-5,0

980,A multicenter study to assess the performance of high-throughput sequencing for virus detection,"High-throughput sequencing (HTS)'s ability to detect known and unknown viruses makes it a powerful tool for broad microbial investigations, such as the evaluation of new cellular substrates that can be used for the development of new biological products. However, like any new assay, regulatory applications of HTS necessitate method standardization. Therefore, our three laboratories initiated a study to evaluate the performance of HTS for the potential detection of viral adventitious agents by adding model viruses to different cell matrices to mimic putative materials for biologics manufacturing. Four model viruses were selected based on different physical and biochemical properties and commercial availability: human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), and human reovirus (REO). In addition, one laboratory tested for porcine circovirus (PCV). Independent samples for HTS were prepared by adding intact virus or extracted viral nucleic acids, alone or mixed, in different HeLa cell matrices (resuspended whole cells, cell lysate or total cellular RNA). Data was obtained using different sequencing platforms (Roche 454, Illumina HiSeq1500, or HiSeq2500). Each laboratory independently performed bioinformatic analyzes using available tools, pipelines, and databases. The results showed that comparable virus detection was obtained in all three laboratories, regardless of sample processing, library preparation, sequencing platform, and bioinformatic analysis: between 0.1 and 3 copies of the viral genome were detected. per cell for all model viruses used. This study highlights the potential of using HTS for the sensitive detection of adventitious viruses in complex biological samples containing cellular backgrounds. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Recent high-throughput sequencing (HTS) investigations have resulted in unexpected discoveries of known and novel viruses in a variety of sample types, including research materials, clinical materials, and biologics. Therefore, HTS can be a powerful tool to complement current methods to demonstrate the absence of accidental or unwanted viruses in biological products, particularly when a new cell line is used. However, HTS is a complex technology with different platforms, which needs standardization for the evaluation of biological products. This collaborative study was carried out to investigate the detection of different virus types using two different HTS platforms. The results of the independently conducted studies demonstrated similar virus detection sensitivity, regardless of the different sample preparation and processing procedures and bioinformatic analyzes performed in the three laboratories. Comparable HTS detection of different virus types supports the future development of reference virus materials for standardization and validation of different HTS platforms.",,"Khan, A. S.;Ng, S. H.

Comparison of these sequences revealed that the NL1, NY15 and W coat proteins were identical in size (287 amino acids) and showed overall sequence similarity (94 to 97%) and 84 to 98% in their N-terminal regions.

The 3'-NTR of NL3 also showed appreciable differences, both in length (240 nt) and in sequence (56 to 63% similarity). These results, in combination with previous serological findings, justify the conclusion that NL1, NY15, and W should be considered strains of the same virus, i.e. bean common mosaic virus, and that NL3 is a strain of a different potyvirus for bean common mosaic virus. which the name 'bean black root virus is proposed.",,"Khan, J.

984,Viral diversity and clonal evolution from phase-free genomic data,"Background: Clonal expansion is a process in which a single organism reproduces asexually, giving rise to a diversified population. It is pervasive in nature, from the evolution of the pathogen within the host to emerging outbreaks of infectious disease. Standard phylogenetic tools are based on complete genomes of individual pathogens or population consensus sequences (phased genotypes). Although high-throughput sequencing technologies can sample population diversity, their inherent short sequence reads make it impossible to assess whether two reads originate from the same clone (phase-less genotypes). This obstacle severely limits the application of phylogenetic methods and the investigation of intra-host dynamics of acute infections using this rich data source. Methods: We present two measures of diversity to study the evolution of clonal populations using phaseless genomic data, which eliminate the need to construct complete genomes. Our method follows a maximum likelihood approach to estimate evolutionary rates and times to the most recent common ancestor, based on a relaxed molecular clock model; independent of a growth model. Deviations from neutral evolution indicate the presence of selection and bottleneck events. Results: We evaluated our methods in silico and then compared them to existing approaches with the well-characterized 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. We then applied our method to high-throughput genomic data from marburgvirus-infected nonhuman primates and inferred the time of infection and the evolutionary rate within the host, and identify purifying selection in viral populations. Conclusions: Our method has the power to make use of minor variants present in less than 1% of the population and capture genomic diversification within days of infection, making it an ideal tool for studying acute dynamics. of RNA viral infection.",,"Khiabanian, H.;Carpenter, Z.;Kugelman, J.;Chan, J.;Trifonov, V.;Nagle, E.;Warren, T.;Iversen, P.;Bavari, S.;Palacios, G.;Rabadan, R.",2014.0,Oct,,0

Mainly, wild bird species have always been implicated as a natural reservoir of the virus and the spread of the disease. In the present study, we report the isolation of Newcastle disease virus (NDV/Peacock/India/2012) in a necropsy brain tissue sample of wild peacock from North India. The complete genome of the virus was found to be 15,186 nucleotides (nts) with six genes in the order of 3â€²-Nâ€“PMF-HN-L-5â€², which was bounded by a 55-nt leader region in the 3â€² end and a trailer sequence of 114 nts at the end of 5â€². Sequence analysis of the fusion protein revealed the dibasic amino acid cleavage site <sup>112</sup>RRQKRF<sup>117</sup>, a motif characteristic of the virulent virus. Phylogenetic analysis placed the isolate in NDV genotype II showing the lowest mean percent divergence (6%) from other genotype II counterparts.

Since then, this classification of strains in terms of genome sequence has proven to be an important tool in understanding the epidemiology and evolution of HBV and has been expanded to include three more genotypes. Parallel to the HBV genotypes described in humans, HBV strains isolated from different primates and hepadnaviruses found in marmots, ground squirrels, ducks and herons have been studied. Sequence differences between HBV genotypes can lead to structural differences at the pregenome level and can also lead to drastic differences at the translational level when specific and frequent mutations occur. There is increasing evidence that the clinical picture, response to treatment, and long-term prognosis may differ depending on the genotype that has infected the patient. Therefore, consideration of traditional serologic patterns in a patient must take into account the genotype of the infecting strain. Nucleotide variability between HBV strains has been used in several studies to trace routes of transmission, and as it has become increasingly clear that differences between HBV genotypes are important, a need has arisen for reliable and easy methods to differentiate between HBV strains.

990,Identification of plant protein kinases in response to abiotic and biotic stresses using superSAGE,"Plants are sessile organisms subject to many environmental adversities. For their survival they must feel and respond to biotic and abiotic stresses efficiently. During this process, protein kinases are essential in the perception of environmental stimuli, triggering signaling cascades. Kinases are among the largest and most important gene families for biotechnological purposes, posing many challenges for bioinformaticians due to the combination of conserved domains in addition to diversified regions. Cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] is an important legume that adapts to different agroclimatic conditions, including drought, humidity, and a range of temperatures. For this culture, the association of the SuperSAGE method with high-throughput sequencing technology would generate reliable transcriptomic profiles with millions of tags counted and statistically analyzed. An approach to assess biotic and abiotic stress was carried out by generating more than 13 million available cowpea SuperSAGE tags from leaves/roots of plants under abiotic (mechanical damage and salinity) or biotic (CABMV, mosaic virus born from salinity) stress. of the cowpea aphid). The annotation and identification of BlastN-linked tags to previously well-described ESTs, allowed for the subsequent identification of kinases. The efficiency of the annotation depended on the database used, with the KEGG figuring as a good source for annotated ESTs, especially when complemented by an independent gene ontology categorization, as well as the genetic index using selected species. The use of different approaches allowed the identification of 1,350 candidate kinases considering biotic libraries and 2,268 regarding abiotic libraries, based on a combination of suitable descriptions and GO terms. Additional searches of kinase-specific databases allowed the identification of a relatively low number of additional kinases, revealing a lack of kinase databases for non-model organisms, especially plants. Regarding the kinase families, a total of 713 potential kinases were classified into 13 families from the CMGC and STE groups. Regarding differentially expressed kinases, 169 out of 713 potential kinases were identified (p < 0.05), 100 increased and 69 decreased when comparing different libraries, allowing the generation of a comprehensive panel of differentially expressed kinases under stress biotic and abiotic in a non-model plant like cowpea. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers.",,"Kido, E.

991,Predicting the global spread of H5N1 avian influenza,"The spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Asia, Europe and Africa has had a huge impact on the poultry industry and represents a major threat to human health. The pathways by which the virus has spread and will spread between countries have been widely debated, but have not yet been comprehensively and quantitatively analysed. We integrated data on phylogenetic relationships of virus isolates, migratory bird movements, and poultry and wild bird trade to determine the pathway of 52 individual introduction events across countries and predict future spread. We show that 9 of 21 H5N1 introductions into Asian countries were likely via poultry, and 3 of 21 were likely via migratory birds. In contrast, the spread to most countries (20/23) in Europe was probably due to migratory birds. The spread in Africa was probably due in part to poultry (2/8 introductions) and in part to migratory birds (3/8). Our analyzes predict that H5N1 is more likely to be introduced to the Western Hemisphere through infected poultry and to the continental United States by the subsequent movement of migratory birds from neighboring countries, rather than from eastern Siberia. These results highlight the potential synergy between trade and the movement of wild animals in the emergence and pandemic spread of pathogens and demonstrate the value of predictive models for disease control. © 2006 by the US National Academy of Sciences.",,"Kilpatrick, A.

This virus was mentioned as bovine faeces-associated circular DNA virus (BoSCV)-like virus discovered in pig faeces. However, the full characteristics of the virus were not identified. For this reason, this research is focused on finding a complete sequence of the genome and analyzing the genetic characteristics of the virus. The virus, now called porcine faeces-associated circular DNA virus in Korea (PoSCV Kor), consists of 2,589 bases that form a circular structure. It has two major ORFs that reverse encode replicase and capsid protein, with each stem-loop structure between the 5' and 3' ends of the two putative ORFs. This feature is the same as PoSCV in New Zealand, but different from chimpanzee faeces-associated circular virus (ChiSCV) and BoSCV, which have a stem-and-loop structure. Therefore, it would be safe that PoSCV Kor is very similar to PoSCV regarding the genetic aspect; the same number of nucleotide bases and amino acid identity of replicase and capsid protein (96 and 93%, respectively).

995,Molecular characterization of chicken infectious anemia viruses detected in broilers and breeders in South Korea,"In South Korea, 32 chicken infectious anemia virus (CIAV) sequences from several breeding and commercial chicken flocks were genetically characterized for the first time. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral protein 1 gene, including a hypervariable region of the CIAV genome, indicated that Korean CIAV strains were separated into groups II, IIIa, and IIIb. The strains were commonly identified on great-grandfather and grand-grandfather breeder farms, as well as commercial chicken farms. In the field, CIAV strains from breeding farms had no clinical effects, but commercial farm strains were associated with depression, growth retardation, and anemia, regardless of the group from which the strain originated. In addition, we identified 7 CIAV genomes that were similar to vaccine strains from vaccinated and unvaccinated breeder flocks. These data suggest that further studies on pathogenicity and vaccine efficacy against the different CIAV groups are needed, along with ongoing CIAV surveillance and genetic analysis in breeder farms. © 2010 Poultry Science Association Inc.",,"Kim, H.

Young chickens less than 4 weeks of age that showed neurological signs were diagnosed as typical EA infection between 2006 and 2011. In 2013, idiopathic EA occurred in unvaccinated 79-day-old chickens that had clinical signs of ataxia and paralysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral protein 2 genes of AE viruses showed that all AE field viruses tested were genetically similar to the vaccine strain [Calnek 1143]. In the yolk sac embryo inoculation test, only a field strain and a commercial vaccine were adapted to the embryo. The results indicated that the AD outbreaks in South Korea were caused by strains genetically similar to the vaccine strain, indicating the possibility of the vaccine failing or persisting in the chicken population.",,"Kim, H.

Clinical signs characterized by anorexia, depression, and signs of nervousness were observed. The isolated A/ostrich/Korea/H829/2014 (H5N8) virus had a cleavage site motif containing multiple basic amino acids, typical of HPAI virus. The phylogenetic tree of the H5 HPAI virus hemagglutinin gene showed that this ostrich H5N8 virus belongs to clade 2.3.4.4 together with H5N8 strains isolated from wild ducks and birds in South Korea in 2014. Pathologically, pancreatic redness, enlargement and spleen hemorrhage, brain friability, and hydropericardium were found prominently. Histological legions were observed in pancreas, spleen, liver, lung, heart, and brain, and influenza A nucleoproteins were detected in the same organs by immunohistochemistry. Other ostriches reared together in open camps were not infected with HPAI virus based on serological and virological tests.

However, the main etiologic agent is unknown. Using metagenomics, we compared the diversity of viruses present in proventriculus samples from flocks diagnosed with DVT with those from healthy flocks in South Korea between 2003 and 2012. Each sample had a mean of 21,538,726 sequence reads generated by high-performance sequencing. yield, with a half length of 160 nt. The enrichment in viral sequences suggested that at least three viruses were present in each DVT sample. Although we were unable to determine a DVT pathogen that matched the known morphology, picornavirus sequences were present in all five disease samples, suggesting an association with DVT. The five samples produced 1045-1720 bp contigs with 81-84% nt sequence identity to turkey hepatitis virus (Accession number: HM751199). Whole genome analysis indicated that the novel picornavirus strain QIA01 was similar to turkey hepatitis virus in the P2 and P3 regions (82.7% nt and 95.5% aa sequence identity), but different in the region structural and partial 2A peptides (56.2% nt and 23.9% aa sequence identity). Furthermore, the QIA01 virus was similar (87.0% nt and 95.6% aa sequence identity) to chicken megrivirus, recently detected in chickens with malabsorption syndrome in Hungary. Our results are useful for understanding the genetic diversity of avian picornaviruses and for classifying chicken megrivirus as a pathogen affecting the digestive tract of chickens.",,"Kim, H.

Complete or nearly complete genomic DNA sequences have been reported for several VZV strains. Recently, clinical strains of VZV were isolated from Korean patients whose genome was sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technology. In this study, we analyzed the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of VZV strains to genetically characterize Korean clinical isolates. Phylogenetic analyzes revealed that three Korean strains, YC01, YC02, and YC03, were linked to clade 2. Comprehensive SNP analysis identified 86 specific sites for all 5 VZV clades. VZV strains isolated from Korea did not form a phylogenetic group. Rather, YC02 and YC03 clustered strongly with the Chinese strain 84-7 within clade 2, more specifically group 2a. Distinctive sequences for group 2a were identified and found to play an important role in separating group 2a strains from other clade 2 strains, as shown by substitution studies. Further genetic analysis with additional strains isolated from Japan, China, and other Asian countries would provide novel insight into the importance of two distinct subclades within clade 2.",,"Kim, M.

To test the effect of neutralizing HGF with antibodies on T-cell immunity against cancer, we generated surrogate antibodies that are reactive to the mouse homologue of the epitope targeted by YYB-101. First, we immunized a chicken with human HGF and monitored changes in the B-cell repertoire by next-generation sequencing (NGS). We then extracted the VH gene repertoire from the NGS data, grouped it into components by sequence homology, and ranked the components by the change in the number of unique VH sequences and the frequencies of the VH sequences within each component after immunization. . These changes should accompany preferential proliferation and somatic hypermutation or gene conversion of B cells encoding HGF-reactive antibodies. One component showed significant increases in the number and frequencies of unique VH sequences and harbored genes encoding antibodies that were reactive to human HGF and competitive with YYB-101 for HGF binding. Some of the antibodies also reacted with mouse HGF. The selected VH sequences shared 98.3% identity and 98.9% amino acid similarity. Therefore, it is likely that all antibodies encoded by them react to the epitope targeted by YYB-101.",,"Kim, S.;Lee, H.;Noh, J.;Lee, Y.;Han, H.;Yoo, D.

1001,Prevalence and genetic characteristics of porcine circovirus type 2 and 3 in Korea.,"BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVAD), caused by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), threaten the swine industry worldwide. Five PCV2 genotypes have recently been identified: PCV2a, PCV2b, PCV2c, PCV2d, and PCV2e. In addition, a new porcine circovirus was identified from a case of a sow with dermatitis, nephropathy syndrome and reproductive failure based on metagenomic analysis and was classified as porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3). Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the prevalence and genetic characteristics of PCV2 and PCV3 in clinical samples. RESULTS: A total of 471 samples (161 lung and lymph node tissue samples from 34 farms and 310 serum samples from 47 farms) were tested for PCV2. Among them, 171 samples from 59 farms that had tested positive for PCV2 were genotyped. An additional 690 samples (296 lung and lymph node tissue samples from 91 farms, 108 aborted fetal samples from 26 farms, and 286 serum samples from 47 farms) were tested for PCV3. Based on PCV2 genotyping results, PCV2d was the most prevalent genotype (107 of 171 samples), and coinfections with combinations of PCV2a, 2b, and 2d were identified in 48 samples from 17 farms. A total of 14 samples from 11 farms also tested positive for PCV2 and PCV3. For PCV3, 57 samples (9.8%) from 32 farms (23.2%) were positive. Among the 108 aborted fetuses from 26 farms, only 2 samples were positive for PCV3. Based on sequence comparisons, PCV2d shares 89.6-91.0% and 93.2-94.3% homology with PCV2a and PCV2b, respectively; 98.6-100% homology is shared between PCV2d strains. The PCV3 strains identified in this study share 98.0-99.5% homology. CONCLUSIONS: Our study concludes that PCV2d has become the most predominant genotype in Korea. PCV3 was also identified in clinical samples, although no significant association with clinical symptoms was observed in PCV3-positive cases.",,"Kim, S. C.;Nazki, S.;Kwon, S.;Juhng, J. H.;Mun, K.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that while all viruses clustered in the Eurasian lineage of avian H7 viruses, at least 12 different genotypes were represented. Most H7 viruses contained at least one genetic segment from the highly pathogenic avian A/Sck/Hong Kong/YU100/02(H5N1)-like virus and could be separated into at least two antigenic groups. Although we did not detect genetically identical strains, the HI assay demonstrated close cross-reactivity of some isolates with H7N9 viruses from China. Animal studies revealed that most genotypes could replicate in the lungs of mice and chickens without prior adaptation, and some, notably subtypes H7N4 and H7N7, induced mortality in mice.

1006,"Analysis of the diversity and evolution of rotavirus species, including the newly determined full genome sequences of rotaviruses F and G","Rotaviruses are one of the main causes of acute viral gastroenteritis in humans and animals. Eight different rotavirus (AH) species have been defined based on antigenicity and nucleotide sequence identities of the VP6 gene. Here we describe the first complete genome sequences of rotavirus F (strain 03V0568) and G (strain 03V0567) with lengths of 18,341 and 18,186 bp, respectively. Both viruses have open reading frames for rotavirus proteins VP1 to VP7 and NSP1 to NSP5 located in all 11 genome segments. Nucleotide sequence identities with other rotaviruses ranged from 29.8% (NSP1 gene) to 61.7% (VPI gene) for rotavirus F and from 29.3% (NSP1-2 gene) to 65 .9% (NSP2 gene) for rotavirus G, confirming their classification as separate virus species. The encoded proteins revealed notable sequence differences between rotavirus species. In contrast, the sequences at the 5' noncoding end of the genome segments are highly conserved among all rotavirus species. Different 3'-terminal consensus sequences are found between rotavirus A/D/F, rotavirus C and rotavirus B/G/H. Phylogenetic analyzes indicated a separation of rotaviruses into two major clades consisting of rotavirus A/C/D/F and rotavirus B/G/H. Within these clades, rotavirus F clustered primarily with rotavirus D and rotavirus G with rotavirus B. In addition, differentiation between mammalian and avian rotavirus A strains, host-specific evolution of rotaviruses B and C , as well as an ancient reassortment event between avian rotavirus A and D are indicated by the phylogenetic data. These results underscore the great diversity of rotaviruses as a result of a complex evolutionary history. (C) 2012 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Kindler, E.;Trojnar, E.;Heckel, G.;Otto, P.

An HI test was performed with the HA antigen of each isolate against a battery of 17 antisera prepared against different IBV strains classified by virus neutralization (VN). The HI test identified Ark 99 and Holland isolates that were similar to strains previously classified by VN. Two isolates included in this study were not inhibited by any of the reference antisera and therefore appeared to be antigenically different. The isolates were also evaluated by VN, and the results of the VN and HI methods agreed.

1009,Enhanced Bioinformatics Profiles of VIDISCA Libraries for Virus Detection and Discovery,"VIDISCA is a next-generation sequencing (NGS) library preparation method designed to enrich samples for viral nucleic acids prior to highly multiplexed, low-depth sequencing. Reliable detection of known viruses and discovery of newly divergent viruses from NGS data require dedicated analysis tools that are both sensitive and accurate. Existing software was used to design a new bioinformatic workflow for high-throughput virus detection and discovery from VIDISCA data. The workflow leverages the molecular biology of VIDISCA library preparation, specifically the use of the restriction enzyme Mse1 that produces biologically replicated library inserts from identical genomes. The workflow performs full metagenomic analysis for non-viral sequence classification, including parasite and host, and performs separate virus-specific analysis. The ribosomal RNA sequence is removed to increase the speed of downstream analysis, and the remaining reads are pooled at 100% identity. Known and new viruses are sensitively detected through alignment to a virus-only protein database, and false positives are eliminated. A new cluster profiling analysis takes advantage of viral biological replications produced by Mse1 digestion, using read clustering to signal the presence of short genomes with very high copy number. Importantly, this analysis ensures that highly repeated sequences are identified even if no homology is detected, as shown here with the detection of a novel gokushovirus genome from human feces. The workflow was validated using readout data derived from serum and fecal samples taken from HIV-1 positive adults and serum samples from pigs that were infected with atypical porcine pestiviruses.",,"Kinsella, C.

At the moment, based on the results of recent investigations, it seems that the amino-terminal recombinant events of the non-structural p80 enzymatic protein of BVDV (Fig. 3) are mainly responsible for the transformation of BVDV ncp, mainly present in nature - to cp BVDV and thus to the development of mucosal disease, MD.",,"Kiss, I.;Kecskemeti, S.",1998.0,Jul,,0
1012,Recovery of divergent avian bornaviruses from cases of proventricular dilatation disease: identification of a candidate etiologic agent,"BACKGROUND: Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) is a fatal disorder that threatens domesticated and wild psittacine birds worldwide. It is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of peripheral and central nervous system ganglia, leading to central nervous system disorders, as well as impaired enteric motility and associated atrophy. For nearly 40 years, a viral etiology has been suspected for PDD, but to date no candidate etiologic agent has been reproducibly linked to the disease. RESULTS: Analysis of 2 series of PDD cases and controls collected independently from different continents using a panviral microarray revealed a bornavirus hybridization signature in 62.5% of PDD cases (5/8) and in none. of the controls (0/8). Ultra-high-throughput sequencing was used to recover the complete viral genome sequence from one of the virus-positive PDD cases. This revealed a bornavirus-like genomic organization for this agent with a high degree of sequence divergence from all previous bornavirus isolates. We propose the name avian bornavirus (ABV) for this agent. Additional ABV-specific PCR analysis of an additional set of independently collected PDD cases and controls yielded a significant difference in ABV detection rate between PDD cases (71%, n = 7) compared to controls (0%, n = 14) (P = 0.01; Fisher's exact test). Partial sequence analysis of a total of 16 ABV isolates that we have now recovered from these and an additional set of cases reveals at least 5 distinct ABV genetic subgroups.

1014,Current knowledge on porcine circovirus 3 (PCV-3): a new virus with yet unknown impact on the swine industry review,"Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV-3) is a recently described virus belonging to the Circoviridae family. It represents the third member of the Circovirus genus capable of infecting pigs, along with PCV-1, considered non-pathogenic, and PCV-2, one of the most economically important viruses for the global pig industry. PCV-3 was originally found by metagenomic analyzes in 2015 in tissues from pigs suffering from porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, reproductive failure, myocarditis, and multisystem inflammation. The lack of other common pathogens as possible infectious agents of these conditions led to the suspicion that PCV-3 could be etiologically involved in the onset of the disease. Subsequently, the viral genome was detected in apparently healthy pigs, and retrospective studies indicated that PCV-3 was already present in pigs in the early 1990s. In fact, current evidence suggests that PCV-3 is a fairly widespread virus in everyone. Recently, virus DNA has also been found in wild boars, widening the scope of susceptibility to infection among the Suidae family; In addition, the potential role of this species as a reservoir for the domestic pig has been proposed. Phylogenetic studies with partial and complete sequences of PCV-3 available from around the world have revealed high nucleotide identity (>96%), although two main groups and several subgroups have also been described. In addition, the existence of a more common ancestor dated about 50 years ago has been proposed. Considering the economic importance and well-known effects of PCV-2 in the swine industry, a new member of the same family as PCV-3 should not be neglected. Studies on epidemiology, pathogenesis, immunity and diagnosis are guaranteed in the coming years. Therefore, this review will update current knowledge and future trends in PCV-3 research.",,"Klaumann, F.;Correa-Fiz, F.;Franzo, G.;Sibila, M.;Nunez, J. I.;Segales, J.",2018.0,,,0
1015,Occurrence and phylogenetic analysis of bovine respiratory syncytial virus in respiratory disease outbreaks in Norway,"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is one of the main pathogens involved in the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRD). The seroprevalence of BRSV in Norwegian cattle herds is high, but its role in respiratory disease epidemics is unclear. The aims of the study were to investigate the etiological role of BRSV and other respiratory viruses in BRD epidemics and to perform a phylogenetic analysis of Norwegian strains of BRSV. BRSV infection was detected serologically and/or virologically in 18 (86%) of 21 outbreaks and in most cases as a single viral agent. When serology indicated bovine coronavirus and/or bovine parainfluenza virus 3 were present, the number of BRSV-positive animals in the herd was always higher, supporting the view that BRSV is the primary pathogen. G-gene sequencing of BRSV-positive samples showed that currently circulating Norwegian BRSVs belong to genetic subgroup II, along with other northern European isolates. An isolate from an outbreak in Norway in 1976 was also investigated. This strain formed a separate branch in subgroup II, clearly different from the current Scandinavian sequences. Currently circulating BRSV could be divided into two different strains that were present in the same geographic area at the same time. The sequence variations between the two strains were in an important antigenic part of the G protein. The results showed that BRSV is the most important aetiological agent of BRD epidemics in Norway and often acts as the sole viral agent. Phylogenetic analysis of Norwegian strains of BRSV and several previously published isolates supported the theory of geographic and temporal clustering of BRSV.",,"Klem, T.

Future porcine genome sequencing projects will reveal multiple novel PERV proviruses from additional breeds and animals. Evaluation of these viral genomes should be carried out to assess the potential risk of cross-species retroviral infection. In this study, we tested common sequence comparison methods for PERV sequence classification and hybrid clone detection. Examination of polymorphic nucleotide positions was found to be the most suitable method. We describe a fast and simple method using bioinformatic software tools that can also be applied to analogous analyzes of other viral genomes. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"Klymiuk, N.;Aigner, B.",2005.0,,10.1007/s11262-004-6779-7,0
1017,Public health impact of Enteroviruses and Parechoviruses,"Enteroviruses (EVs) comprise viruses originally classified on cell culture replication patterns and clinical manifestations into several groups: poliovirus, coxsackievirus A, coxsackievirus B, and ECHOvirus. The closely related genus Parechovirus has more recently been associated with human disease. EVs are common commensals of the human gut, often found without any ill effects on the person, but are also associated with a wide range of diseases and syndromes including non-specific skin diseases, hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) , conjunctivitis, meningitis and encephalitis, myocarditis and poliomyelitis.

1018,serological classification of bovine enteroviruses,"Virus neutralization (VN), complement fixation (CF) and immunoprecipitation (IP) crossmatch tests were used to compare the seven currently recognized bovine enterovirus (BEV) serotypes with seven serologically distinct strains previously isolated in Great Britain and two other BEVs. from United Kingdom. . Based on the criteria used to differentiate other human and animal picornavirus serotypes, BEV types 1, 4, 5 and 6 were found to be related to each other and could be included in a single serotype. Types 3 and 7 were found to be identical and related to serotype 2. The other nine BEVs were included in serotype 1 or 2. Not all strains in each serotype were identical and antigenic variants were designated as subtypes. Antigenic relationships not revealed by VN were demonstrated in the CF and IP tests. Bovine enterovirus strains whose antisera had the broadest intratypic reactivity were suggested as prototypes. The two proposed BEV serotypes could also be distinguished by their ability to agglutinate erythrocytes. Guinea pig erythrocytes were agglutinated by both serotypes while sheep erythrocytes only reacted with serotype 1.",,"Knowles, N. J.;Barnett, I. T. R.",1985.0,,10.1007/bf01309912,0

This allowed classification of all strains into 3 major groups based on the type of cytopathic effect on IBRS-2 cells and further subdivision based on the production of cytopathic effect on BHK 21, HeLa, and VERO cells. None of the porcine enterovirus strains were neutralized by human enterovirus antisera (Lim Benyesh-Melnick Pools) with the exception of swine vesicular disease virus, which was neutralized by coxsackie B5 antiserum. Antisera prepared in gnotobiotic pigs or in guinea pigs against the 8 serotypes of porcine enteroviruses failed to neutralize 9 isolates that could be classified into 3 new serotypes, for which numbers 9, 10 and 11 are proposed. Guinea pig sera could be used as an alternative to sera from gnotobiotic pigs for type differentiation.",,"Knowles, N. J.;Buckley, L. S.;Pereira, H. G.",1979.0,,10.1007/bf01317552,0

Current methods often require bacterial or viral isolation, or testing of only a limited number of known species by quantitative PCR analysis. In this paper, feces from two 25-day-old piglets with diarrhea from Texas, USA, were analyzed by next-generation metagenomic sequencing to rapidly identify potential pathogens. Our analysis included a short-read rapid sorting bioinformatics pipeline and de novo genome assembly that resulted in the identification of a porcine enterovirus G (EV-G), a complete genome with substantial nucleotide differences (>30%) between current sequences, and a new non-structural protein similar in sequence to the Torovirus papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro).

1023,Gentian mosaic virus: a new species of the genus Fabavirus,"ABSTRACT A viral isolate, designated N-1 and obtained from a gentian plant (Gentiana scabra) showing mosaic symptoms, was mechanically transmitted to nine plant species in six families. These plants are known as fabavirus hosts. Isolate N-1 was composed of isometric particles 30 nm in diameter and included two RNA molecules approximately 6.0 and 3.6 kb in length, as estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The RNAs were packaged separately in two of the three types of particles. Each particle contained two different proteins with Mr values of 39.3 x 10(3) and 26.6 x 10(3), determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequences of the RNAs suggested that each encoded a single large polyprotein, in which the putative functional proteins were arranged in a manner similar to those of Broad bean wilt virus 1 (BBWV-1) and the Broad bean wilt virus 2 (BBWV-2), which are members of the genus Fabavirus (family Comoviridae). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of the proteins indicated that those of isolate N-1 shared 38-66% identity with those of BBWV-1 and BBWV-2, but only 16-42% identity. identity with those of a comovirus, cowpea mosaic virus. . Phylogenetic analysis, based on RNA polymerase amino acid sequences, placed isolate N-1 in a separate lineage from BBWV-1 and BBWV-2. In the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, isolate N-1 showed a distant serologic relationship with BBWV-1, BBWV-2, and Lamium mild mosaic virus, another fabavirus. Our results suggest that N-1 represents a new species of Fabavirus. We propose the name Gentian mosaic virus for this new species.",,"Kobayashi, Y.

1024,Bovine diarrhea virus: an update,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a pathogen of cattle, a member of the family Flaviviridae, genus pestivirus, which also includes classical swine fever virus (CSFV, or hog cholera virus) and cholera virus. sheep border disease (BDV). It causes important economic losses associated mainly with reproductive failure. Pestiviruses are small enveloped viruses, with a diameter of about 40 nm. The nucleocapsid is probably icosahedral. The genome consists of a positive single-stranded RNA encoding approximately 430 kD of protein product. Genetic expression consists of the synthesis of a polyprotein that is processed co- and post-translationally. According to their ""in vitro"" behavior, two biotypes can be distinguished: non-cytopathic (ncp) and cytopathic (cp), most likely derived from ncp by mutations and/or recombination. BVDV can cross the placenta and infect the fetus, causing a range of problems from stillbirth to the birth of a persistently infected calf (P), depending on the age of the fetus at the time of infection. PI animals are immunotolerant to the virus and excrete it in all their secretions. Only the ncp biotype has been isolated from PI animals. Superinfection of a PI animal with a cp strain causes mucosal disease, which is always fatal. Outbreaks of a severe, sometimes hemorrhagic disease caused by nec BVDV have occurred in Canada and the US since 1993. Genomic and serological differences between the ""traditional"" strains and the viruses isolated from these outbreaks led to the division of BVDV in subtypes I and II, both including cp and ncp strains. Analyzes of the non-coding 5'-UTR region of the genome of pestiviruses from different species (bovine, ovine, porcine) suggest that there are at least 3 genotypes within the genus. A new classification of these viruses has been proposed, based on genomic sequence rather than species of origin. There is genomic heterogeneity in the BVDV genome, which presents 3 hypervariable zones, 2 of them in the main neutralizing protein. In Argentina, the prevalence of antibodies against BVDV in the bovine population is 70% and the prevalence of persistent infections is around 1%.",,"Kobrak, A.;Weber, E. L.",1997.0,,,0

1029,Phylogenetic and recombination analysis of the herpesviruses of the genus Varicellovirus,"BACKGROUND: Varicelloviruses comprise a genus within the alphaherpesvirus subfamily and infect both humans and other mammals. Recently, next-generation sequencing has been used to generate genomic sequences for several members of the Varicellovirus genus. Here, currently available varicose virus genomic sequences were used for phylogenetic, recombination, and genetic distance analyses. RESULTS: A phylogenetic network was generated that included genomic sequences from individual species and suggested a potential restriction between ungulate and non-ungulate viruses. Intraspecies genetic distances were greater in ungulate viruses (pseudorabies virus (SuHV-1) 1.65%, bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) 0.81%, equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV -1) 0.79%, equine herpesvirus type 4 (EHV-4) 0.16%) than non-ungulate viruses (feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) 0.0089%, canine herpesvirus type 1 (CHV-1) 0.005%, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) 0.136%). The G+C content of ungulate viruses was also higher (SuHV-1 73.6%, BHV-1 72.6%, EHV-1 56.6%, EHV-4 50.5%) compared to non-ungulate viruses (FHV-1 45.8%, CHV-1 31.6%, VZV 45.8%), suggesting a possible link between G + C content and intraspecies genetic diversity. Varicellovirus clade nomenclature is variable among different species, and we propose a standardization based on genomic genetic distance. A recent study reported no recombination between sequenced FHV-1 strains; however, in the present study, both splitstree, bootscan and PHI analysis indicated recombination. We also found that the recently sequenced Brazilian CHV-1 strain BTU-1 may contain a genetic signal in the UL50 gene of an unknown varicose virus. CONCLUSION: Together, the data contribute to a further understanding of varicella virus genomics, and we also suggest a new clade nomenclature scheme based on genetic distances.",,"Kolb, A.

1032,"The genetic grouping of Borna disease virus wild-type animal isolates, vaccine and laboratory strains strongly reflects their regional geographic origin.","The aim of this study was to obtain more detailed information on the genetic evolution and variability of Borna disease virus (BDV). Phylogenetic analyzes were performed on field viruses that originated from naturally infected animals, the BDV 'Dessau' vaccine strain, four widely used laboratory strains, and the new BDV No/98 subtype. Four regions of the BDV genome were analyzed: the entire p40, p10 and p24 genes and the 5' untranslated region of the X/P transcript. BDV isolates from the same geographic area exhibited a distinctly higher degree of identity with each other than with BDV isolates from other regions, regardless of host species and year of isolation. Five different groups could be established within endemic areas, corresponding to the geographical regions from which the viruses originated: (i) a group from the Rhine Valley of Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein, closely related to the group from Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria II, which geographically borders (ii) on the western part of Germany; (iii) a third group, called the Bavaria I group, whose existence is limited to Bavaria; (iv) a group from southern Saxony-Anhalt and bordering northern Saxony, joined to the territories of these federal states in eastern Germany; and (v) a mixed group, made up of samples from different areas of Germany; however, these mainly came from the federal states of Thuringia and Lower Saxony. The laboratory strains and the vaccine strain were grouped into these groups according to their geographic origins. All field and laboratory strains, as well as the vaccine strain, clearly segregated from the recently described, highly divergent BDV No/98 strain, which originated in an area of Austria where Borna disease is not endemic.",,"Kolodziejek, J.;Durrwald, R.;Herzog, S.;Ehrensperger, F.;Lussy, H.;Nowotny, N.",2005.0,Feb,,0

The detection of WNV in a blood donation from an area with a low prevalence of WNV in humans (only three serologically diagnosed cases between 2008 and 2014) is surprising and emphasizes the importance of WNV nucleic acid testing in blood donations even in such areas, along with active mosquito surveillance programs.",,"Kolodziejek, J.;Seidel, B.;Jungbauer, C.;Dimmel, K.;Kolodziejek, M.;Rudolf, I.;HubÃ¡lek, Z.;Allerberger, F.;Nowotny, N.",2015.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0126381,0
1034,Whole genome analysis of human and bovine G8P 1 rotavirus strains isolated in Nigeria provides evidence of direct interspecies transmission from bovine to human,"Group A bovine rotavirus (RVA) G8P[1] strains have rarely been detected in humans.

In order to obtain precise information on the origin and evolution of these G8P[1] strains, the complete nucleotide sequences of the complete genomes of HMG035 and NGRBg8 strains were determined and analyzed in the present study. In full genome analysis, strains HMG035 and NGRBg8 were found to be very closely related to each other in all 11 segments, and were found to have a constellation of RVA-like bovine genotypes (G8-P[1]-I2-R2- C2 -M2-A11-N2-T6-E2-H3). Furthermore, in phylogenetic analysis, each of the 11 genes in strains HMG035 and NGRBg8 appeared to be of bovine origin. Therefore, strains HMG035 and NGRBg8 were suggested to derive from a common origin, and strain NGRBg8 was assumed to represent an example of bovine RVA strains that were transmitted to humans.

1035,Rearrangement of human and animal rotavirus gene segments in emerging DS-1-like G1P 8 rotavirus strains,"The emergence and rapid spread of new DS-1-like G1P[8] human rotaviruses was recently reported in Japan. More recently, these intergenogroup reassortant strains were identified in Thailand, implicating the continued spread of unusual strains of rotavirus in Asia. During rotavirus surveillance in Thailand, three DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant strains having G3P[8] (RVA/Human-wt/THA/SKT-281/2013/G3P[8] and RVA/Human-wt/ THA/SKT- 289/2013/G3P[8]) and G2P[8] (RVA/Human-wt/THA/LS-04/2013/G2P[8]) were identified in fecal samples from hospitalized children with acute gastroenteritis. In this study, we sequenced and characterized the complete genomes of strains SKT-281, SKT-289, and LS-04. In full genome analysis, all three strains exhibited unique genotype constellations, including genogroup 1 and 2 genes: G3-P[8]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2 for strains SKT-281 and SKT-289 and G2-P[8]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2 for strain LS-04. Except for the G genotype, the unique genotype constellation of the three strains (P[8]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2) is commonly shared with G1P[8-like DS- 1] strains. In phylogenetic analysis, nine of the 11 genes of strains SKT-281 and SKT-289 (VP4, VP6, VP1-3, NSP1-3, and NSP5) appeared to have originated from DS-like G1P[8] strains. 1, while the remaining VP7 and NSP4 genes appeared to be of equine and bovine origin, respectively. Thus, strains SKT-281 and SKT-289 appeared to be reassortant strains in terms of G1P[8]-like DS-1, human and/or animal-derived rotaviruses. On the other hand, seven of the 11 genes of the LS-04 strain (VP7, VP6, VP1, VP3, and NSP3-5) appear to have originated from locally circulating DS-1-like human rotaviruses G2P[4], while that three genes (VP4, VP2 and NSP1) were assumed to be derived from DS-1-like G1P[8] strains. In particular, the remaining NSP2 gene of strain LS-04 appeared to be of bovine origin. Therefore, strain LS-04 was assumed to be a locally circulating DS-1-like G1P[8], DS-1-like G2P[4] multiple rearrangement strain, human and/or bovine rotaviruses. bovine-like. In general, the great genomic diversity among DS-1-like G1P[8] strains appeared to have been generated through reassortment involving human and animal strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report on genome-wide-based characterization of DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant strains having G3P[8] and G2P[8] genotypes that have emerged in Thailand.

1041,"Characterization and identification of Oya virus, a virus of the Simbu serogroup of the genus Bunyavirus, isolated from a pig suspected of Nipah virus infection","virus, called Oya virus, was isolated in cultures of Vero cells from the lungs of a pig suspected of Nipah virus infection. The virus was revealed as a spherical enveloped RNA virus with a diameter of 79 nm. For the identification of the Oya virus, RT-PCR was performed. A common primer set for S-RNA of the Simbu serogroup of the genus Bunyavirus was able to amplify an Oya virus RNA cDNA. Product sequence data revealed that the partial gene S-RNA segment of Oya virus had 65-70% homology to published cDNA sequences of Simbu serogroup viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the data showed that Oya virus is grouped in the Simbu serogroup, but is genetically distinct from the serogroup viruses that have been analyzed molecularly. Serological surveys revealed that the virus was widely and densely distributed in Malaysia.",,"Kono, Y.;Yusnita, Y.;Mohd Ali, A. R.;Maizan, M.;Sharifah, S. H.;Fauzia, O.;Kubo, M.;Aziz, A.

1042,Virological and pathological characterization of an avian influenza A H1N1 virus,"Gene segments from avian influenza A H1N1 viruses have reassorted with other influenza viruses to generate pandemic strains over the past century. However, little effort has been put into understanding the characteristics of H1N1 avian influenza viruses. Here we present the genome sequence and a molecular and virological characterization of an avian influenza A virus, A/wild bird/Korea/SK14/2014 (A/SK14, H1N1), isolated from migratory birds in South Korea during the flu season. winter of 2014-2015. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus belongs to the Eurasian avian lineage. Although it retained the avian receptor binding preference, the A/SK14 virus also exhibited detectable human-like receptor binding and was able to replicate in differentiated primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. In animal models, A/SK14 virus was moderately pathogenic in mice, and the virus was detected in nasal washings of inoculated guinea pigs, but not in direct contact guinea pigs. Although A/SK14 showed moderate pathogenicity and no evidence of transmission in a mammalian model, our results suggest that the dual receptor specificity of the A/SK14-like virus might allow faster adaptation to mammals, emphasizing the importance increased ongoing surveillance and risk assessment activities.",,"Koo, B.

1043,Evolution of thymidine and thymidylate kinases: the possibility of independent capture of TK genes by different groups of viruses,"Phylogenetic analysis of viral and cellular thymidine and thymidylate kinases was performed using computer-aided methods. Multiple alignments and tentative phylogenetic trees were generated for the two families of these enzymes, including a) mammalian thymidine kinases (TK), poxvirus, African swine fever virus, E. coli, and bacteriophage T4; and b) yeast and poxvirus thymidylate kinases (ThyK) and distantly related herpesvirus proteins with both enzymatic activities. Analysis of the first family TK alignment highlighted three strongly conserved segments. Two of these corresponded to motifs A and B of the purine NTP-binding pattern. The third C-terminal segment, showing the greatest conservation, encompasses a modified Zn finger motif. It is speculated that this motif might be involved in TK oligomerization. Phylogenetic trees constructed by three different methods suggested that cellular TK genes could be independently captured by bacteriophage T4, African swine fever virus, fowlpox virus, and the other poxviruses. The observed tree topologies seem to contradict popular schemes of virus-host coevolution and imply that different subdivisions of poxviruses diverged earlier in evolution than their hosts. Bacteriophage T4 deoxynucleoside monophosphate kinase was shown to be related to the ThyK family. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the ThyK genes were likely acquired independently by T4 phage, poxviruses, and herpesviruses.",,"Koonin, E. V.;Senkevich, T. G.",1992.0,Apr,,0
1044,Characterization of the RKZ isolate of ovine herpesvirus 1,"cytopathic effect (CPE) characterized mainly by round cell foci was observed in healthy lamb primary choroid plexus cell cultures after cryopreservation. It was possible to transmit the infectious agent to other primary cells of ovine origin by co-culture with infected cells. Using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy it was found that a high percentage of sheep (65-80% in 3 different herds in Slovakia) are infected with this infectious agent. Electron microscopy of cells with CPE revealed the presence of herpesvirus particles. Viral DNA was isolated from infected cells using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and then used as a probe in Southern blot analysis. The probe specifically reacted only with DNA from cells infected with ovine herpesvirus 1 (OvHV-1), but not with DNA from other ruminant herpesviruses. Some of the HindIII restriction fragments of the DNA of the OvHV-1 isolate designated RKZ were cloned. Part of clone H9 was sequenced identifying a gene encoding a polypeptide homologous to the conserved herpesvirus structural protein VP23. From the comparison of the sequence of this clone with the VP23 sequences of other herpesviruses, it was deduced that OvHV-1 could be classified within the Rhadinovirus genus of the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily. Sequencing of the DNA clone H9 of the RKZ isolate made it possible to establish a sensitive and highly specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of OvHV-1.",,"KopÃ¡Äek, J.;RejholcovÃ¡, O.;KoptidesovÃ¡, D.;ÄŒiampor, F.;Rijsewijk, F.

The variability of the binding pattern was demonstrated for CSFV and also for bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) strains and isolates. Panels of mAbs against E2 and EO gave rise to very different patterns of reactivity. E2-specific mAbs reacted with (i) all CSFV isolates, (ii) only 4 of 126 CSFV isolates, or (in) approximately 90% of CSFV isolates tested and 78% of pestivirus isolates of ruminants. EO anti-CSFV mAbs allowed detection of greater variability between CSFV strains and isolates than anti-E2 mAbs. None of the 11 anti-EO mAbs recognized a conserved epitope for CSFV or showed cross-reactivity with ruminant pestiviruses. The use of both panels of mAbs against two CSFV structural glycoproteins led to the discrimination of 21 antigenic types of CSFV strains and isolates.

1048,Phylogenetic evolution of human influenza viruses of swine origin: a 2009 H1N1 pandemic,"Knowledge of the genome constellation in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza A virus from different countries and different hosts is valuable for monitoring and understanding the evolution and migration of these strains. Complete genome sequences of selected influenza A viruses distributed worldwide are publicly available, and few longitudinal genome studies of human, avian, and swine influenza A viruses have been performed. All possible downloadable SIV sequences of influenza A viruses available on the GISAID (Global Initiative for Sharing Avian Influenza Data) Platform were first analyzed through the Influenza Virus Resource web servers at NCBI. Phylogenetic study of the circulating human pandemic H1N1 virus indicated that the new variant possesses a distinct evolutionary trait. There is no single way that pandemic H1N1 has acquired new genes from other distinguishable viruses recently circulating in local populations of humans, pigs, or domestic birds in various geographic regions. The wide genetic diversity among entire segments present in the genome of the pandemic H1N1 virus suggests that there have been multiple introductions of the virus during the period 1999-2009. The initial interspecies transmission could have occurred in the long-term past, and after that, rearrangement steps lead to three lineages: the classic SIV that is prevalent in North America, the bird-like SIV in Europe, and the SIV related to birds in Asia. This analysis contributes to the evidence that pigs are not the only hosts that play the ""mixing vessel"" role, as has been suggested for many years.",,"Kowalczyk, A.;Markowska-Daniel, I.",2010.0,,,0

Experimental inoculation of 1-day-old chickens resulted in lower hematocrit values, thymus atrophy, and bone marrow atrophy. CAV was confirmed by PCR in the thymus, bone marrow, bursa of Fabricius, liver, spleen, ileocecal tonsils, duodenum, and proventriculus. The nucleotide sequence of the complete viral protein (VP)1 gene was determined by direct sequencing. The VP1 nucleotide sequence alignment of CAV isolates from Slovenia (CAV-69/00, CAV-469/01 and CAV-130/03) showed 99.4% to 99.9% homology. Alignment of the VP1 nucleotide sequence of the Slovenian isolates with 19 other CAV strains demonstrated 94.4% to 99.4% homology. The Slovenian isolates shared the highest homology with the BD-3 isolate from Bangladesh. Deduced VP1 amino acid alignment showed that the Slovenian isolates shared 100% homology and had very similar amino acid sequence to the Bangladeshi BD-3 strain (99.6%) and were 99-1% similar to the G6 strain. from Japan and strain L-028 from the United States. The Slovenian isolates were less similar (96.6%) to the 82-2 strain from Japan.

1052,Metagenomics: a new approach to study our microbial neighbors,"Background: In our time, the information society, computer technologies, including data analysis procedures, are part of every place of life. Bioinformatics provides approaches for collecting and updating knowledge that were unimaginable two decades ago. Metagenomics is the area of bioinformatics that helps improve our understanding of the composition of microbial species in farmed or companion animals, humans, or the environment. Objectives: This paper describes the main steps of a metagenomic analysis. As an example, the metagenomic investigation of swine dysentery as an important animal disease is shown. Materials and Methods: Intestinal contents of three clinically diseased finishing pigs were sampled from three different sections of the intestine (ie, ceca, colon, and rectum). All DNA was extracted from the samples and then sequenced using state-of-the-art sequencing technology. The 1,782,466 reads produced were pooled and analyzed. The reads were aligned with archaeal, bacterial and viral genome databases using the Kraken bioinformatics tool. The results of the alignments were visualized by the Krona tool. Results and Discussion: The presented case study helps the reader understand how metagenomic studies work and provides new professional insights into the microbiome of selected organs in different creatures. The proportions of the different taxa provide an idea of the microbial communities of the intestine in sick animals. In addition, a brief review is presented to demonstrate the possibilities of applying metagenomics in the field of animal health. Bioinformatics is an emerging area and it is very important to have knowledge -both clinicians and researchers- about the methods, their possible results and limitations. This work provides a simple introduction to metagenomics in the language of veterinarians.",,"Kriko, E.;Farkas, R.;Adorjan, A.;Makrai, L.;Solymosi, N.",2018.0,Jul,,0
1053,Deep sequencing analysis reveals temporal changes in the microbiota associated with the development of bovine digital dermatitis,"Bovine digital dermatitis (DD) is one of the leading causes of lameness in dairy cattle worldwide. Despite 35 years of research, the definitive etiologic agent associated with the disease process remains unknown. Previous studies have shown that multiple bacterial species are associated with lesions, with spirochetes being the most reliably identified organism. This study details the deep sequencing-based metagenomic evaluation of 48 staged DD biopsy specimens collected during a 3-year longitudinal study of disease progression. More than 175 million sequences were evaluated using shotgun and 16S metagenomic techniques. Based on the results of shotgun sequencing, there was no evidence of a fungal or DNA viral etiology. The bacterial microbiota of biopsy samples progresses through a systematic series of changes that correlate with the novel morphological lesion scoring system developed as part of this project. This scoring system was validated, since the microbiota of each stage was statistically significantly different from that of other stages (P<0.001). The microbiota of the control biopsy samples was the most diverse and became less diverse as the lesions developed. Although Treponema spp. they predominated in advanced lesions, they were relatively few in the recently described early lesions that are associated with the beginning of the disease process. The Treponema spp. identified early in the disease changes considerably as the lesions progress through the identified morphologic stages. The results of this study support the hypothesis that DD is a polybacterial disease process and provide unique insights into temporal changes in bacterial populations throughout lesion development. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Krull, A.

Phylogenetic analysis with the complete VP4 nucleotide sequences of these 6 viruses and 29 enterovirus serotypes classified 3 of the viruses as echovirus type 18 serotype (EV18) and 3 as human enterovirus serotype 71 (HEV71). These results were confirmed by remicroneutralization tests with HEV monospecific antisera or further phylogenetic analysis with the complete VP4 nucleotide sequences.

The aim of this study was to determine the value of NGS in detecting pathogens in clinical samples, namely fecal samples from pigs with diarrhea. Fecal samples from four pigs with severe diarrhea were analyzed. NGS libraries were prepared from sample suspensions and used for Ion Torrent sequencing. In total, 396,486 reads were assembled into 1,537 contigs. Taxonomy units were assigned to 786 contigs, while 751 contigs were left unassigned. All four samples tested positive for Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED) virus. In two samples, viruses of the genus Picobirnavirus and porcine astrovirus were also detected, while one sample was positive for the virus of the genus Torovirus. In addition to viral sequences, sequences from bacteria, archaea, nematodes, protists, and amoebas were also detected in the investigated samples.

1058,Nomenclature of Viruses Below the Species Level: A Standardized Nomenclature for Laboratory Animal-Adapted Virus Strains and Variants Assigned to the Family Filoviridae,"The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) organizes the classification of viruses into taxa, but is not responsible for the nomenclature of member taxa. International expert groups, such as the ICTV Study Groups, recommend the classification and naming of viruses and their strains, variants and isolates. The ICTV Filoviridae Study Group has recently introduced an updated classification and nomenclature for filoviruses. Subsequently, and together with many other filovirus experts, a consistent nomenclature for its natural genetic variants and isolates was developed that aims to simplify the retrieval of sequence data from electronic databases. This is an important first step toward a viral genome annotation standard as sought by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Here, this work is extended to include filoviruses obtained in the laboratory by artificial selection through the step in laboratory hosts. The previously developed template for the naming of wild-type filovirus genetic variants (<virus name> <suffix of isolated host>/<sampling country>/<sampling year>/<genetic variant designation>-<host designation) is retained. isolation>), but It is proposed to adapt the type of information added to each field for variants adapted to laboratory animals. For example, the full designation of an Ebola virus Mayinga variant adapted at the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology ""Vector"" to cause disease in guinea pigs after seven passages would be similar to ""Ebola virus VECTOR/C .porcellus-lab /COD/1976/Mayinga-GPA-P7"". As proposed for the names of natural variants of filoviruses, we suggest using the full designation in databases as well as in the methods section of publications.

1060,Taxonomic rearrangement of the family Bornaviridae,"Knowledge of bornaviruses has expanded considerably during the last decade. A possible reservoir of Borna disease virus has been identified in mammals, divergent bornaviruses have been detected in birds and reptiles, and elements similar to endogenous bornaviruses have been discovered in the genomes of vertebrates of several species. Previous sequence comparisons and alignments have indicated that members of the current family Bornaviridae are phylogenetically diverse and not adequately classified in the existing bornavirus taxonomy supported by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). We provide an update on these analyzes and describe their implications for taxonomy. We propose keeping the family name Bornaviridae and the genus Bornavirus but reorganizing the species classification. PAirwise sequence comparison (PASC) of bornavirus genomes and comparison of genomic and protein sequences with the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), in combination with other already published phylogenetic analyzes and known biological characteristics of bornaviruses, indicate that this genus must include at least five species. : Mammalian bornavirus 1 (classical Borna disease virus and divergent Borna disease virus isolate No/98), psittaciform bornavirus 1 (bird/psittacine bornavirus 1, 2, 3, 4, 7), passerine bornavirus 1 (bird/canary bornaviruses C1, C2, C3, LS), passerine 2 bornavirus (estrildid finch bornavirus EF) and Waterbird 1 bornavirus (avian bornavirus 062CG). This classification is also consistent with the biological characteristics of these viruses and their vertebrate hosts. A snake bornavirus, proposed to be called Loveridge's garter snake virus 1, should be classified as a member of an additional species (Elapid bornavirus 1), without assigning a genus, in the family Bornaviridae. Avian bornaviruses 5, 6, MALL, and other ""reptile bornaviruses"" (""Gabon viper virus"") should remain unclassified until more information is available.

A revision of this classification is urgently needed to accommodate the recent description of eleven highly divergent simian arteriviruses in various African non-human primates, a novel arterivirus in an African giant bush rat, and a novel arterivirus in brushtails common in New Zealand. . Furthermore, the current nomenclature of arteriviruses is not in accordance with the most recent version of the International Code of Classification and Nomenclature of Viruses. Here we describe an updated, modified, and improved arterivirus taxonomy based on current data. Taxon-specific sequence breaks are established based on a recently established 1b open reading frame phylogeny and pairwise sequence comparison (PASC) of entire coding arterivirus genomes. As a result, the current Arterivirus genus is replaced by five genera: Equartevirus (for EAV), Rodartevirus (LDVÂ +Â PRRSV), Simartevirus (SHFVÂ +Â simian arterivirus), Nesartevirus (for giant forest rat arterivirus) , and Dipartevirus (common brushtail arterivirus). The current species of PRRSV is split into two species to accommodate the clear divergence of the European and American ""types"" of PRRSV, both of which are now given virus status.

We used state-of-the-art sequencing and historical virus culture samples to determine 14 full-length and nine full-coding nairoviral genomic sequences to further characterize these species. Viruses not previously sequenced include Abu Mina, Clo Mor, Great Saltee, Hughes, Raza, Sakhalin, Soldier, and Tillamook viruses. In addition, we present genomic sequence information from additional isolates of previously sequenced Avalon, Dugbe, Sapphire II, and Zirqa viruses. Finally, we identified Tunis virus, previously thought to be a phlebovirus, as an isolate of Abu Hammad virus. Phylogenetic analyzes indicate the need to reassign Sapphire II virus to Dera Ghazi Khan nairovirus and to reassign Hazara, Tofla and Nairobi sheep disease viruses to new species. We also propose new species for the Kasokero group (Kasokero, Leopards Hill, Yogue virus), the Ketarah group (Gossas, Issyk-kul, Keterah/soft tickvirus), and the Burana group (WÄ“nzhÅ u tick virus, HuángpÃ tick virus 1, TÇŽchÃ©ng tick virus 1).

1063,Incidence of endogenous viral genes in two strains of white leghorn hens selected for egg production and susceptibility or resistance to Marek's disease,"Endogenous viral (ev) genes related to avian leukosis virus were classified in two differentially selected strains of Leghorns to investigate whether such genes affect production traits. The K strain was selected for its resistance to Marek's disease (MD) and for its high production and egg weight, while the S strain was selected only for susceptibility to DM. Except that the founders of the K strain included some commercial birds, both strains were derived from a common genetic base. Restriction fragment length analyzes of DNA from 110 K-strain and 94 S-strain birds revealed the presence of 8 different ev genes, 6 of which were identical to previously identified loci. This result was confirmed by assays for group-specific antigen (gs antigen), the product of the gag region of the ev genes. The gs antigen levels in birds closely followed what had been predicted from data obtained from the previously described ev genes. Both strains had a similar average number of ev genes per bird (3.5 and 3.2 for the S and K strains, respectively). However, the K strain carried only five different ev genes, while the S strain carried seven. Four of these loci were present in both strains. Among the ev genes absent or appearing less frequently in the K strain were those encoding infectious endogenous viruses (ev-10 and possibly ev-19) or internal viral gag proteins (ev-3). Only those ev genes that are transcriptionally silent or that code for the viral envelope gene were present with higher frequency in the K strain. The results indicate that selection for egg traits and/or resistance to Marek's disease reduces the frequency of ev genes that produce endogenous genes. virus or viral gag proteins.",,"Kuhnlein, U.;Gavora, J.

1064,Natural peste des petits ruminants virus infection: new pathological findings resembling other morbillivirus infections,"The present study describes the pathological and virological findings in 15 sheep and 6 goats that died of natural infection with peste des petits ruminants virus in Turkey. Pathological findings included erosive-ulcerative stomatitis, fibrino-necrotic tracheitis, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, multifocal coagulation necrosis in the liver, and severe lymphocytolysis in the lymphoid tissues. Syncytial cells were conspicuous, especially in the oral mucosa, pulmonary alveoli, liver, and lymphoid tissues. In addition to the typical tissue distribution, eosinophilic intracytoplasmic and/or intranuclear inclusions were observed in the epithelial cells lining the renal pelvis and mucosa of the abomasum. Immunolabeling of the viral antigen was observed in the kidney, brain, rumen, abomasum, heart and myocytes of the tongue, in addition to its most typical locations. In this study, we report and describe in detail the first endemic peste des petits ruminants in Kirikkale province, central Anatolia of Turkey. In conclusion, these previously unreported pathologic findings in natural PPR virus infection establish a basis for resemblance to other morbillivirus infections, such as canine distemper and marine mammal distemper. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyzes indicated that the 448 bp genome fragment was amplified in 18 cases (18/21, 85.7%). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses belong to lineage 4 in the common peste des petits rumiants virus phylogenetic tree.",,"Kul, O.;Kabakci, N.;Atmaca, H.

1065,Emergence of novel reassortant H6N2 avian influenza viruses in ducks in India,"Recent reports of human infection with avian influenza viruses (AIV) of the H6 subtype, which are prevalent in terrestrial poultry, indicate the evolution of the virus to a possible pandemic strain. Here, we report the antigenic and genetic characterization of two H6N2 viruses isolated from apparently healthy domestic ducks in Kerala and Assam, India, during 2014 and 2015, respectively. The hemagglutination inhibition assay revealed antigenic divergence between the two isolates, which was corroborated by amino acid differences at 55 positions (15.98%) between their hemagglutinin (HA) 1. Sequence analysis indicated that both viruses are of avian origin with avian receptor specificity, low pathogenic for poultry and sensitive to oseltamivir. However, Kerala14 had the mutation marker V27I for amantadine resistance in M2. Assam15 virus had an additional N-linked glycosylation at HA2 (position 557) compared to Kerala14 virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene revealed that both viruses belonged to different lineages (Eurasia and Asia II). Phylogeny of neuraminidase and internal gene segments revealed that both viruses are new rearrangements and are genetically distinct with different gene constellations. The results suggest that independent introductions of the two H6N2 viruses into India and migratory wild birds on the Central Asian Flyway could be the source of H6N2 viruses in Indian ducks. Therefore, continuous surveillance of AIV in poultry and wild birds is essential for early detection of the emergence of new strains with pandemic potential and control of their spread.",,"Kumar, M.;Nagarajan, S.;Murugkar, H.

1066,"Isolation and phylogenetic analysis of an orf virus from sheep in Makhdoom, India","Orf (ecthyma contagiosum) is a rash disease caused by a parapoxvirus and occurs mainly in sheep and goats with zoonotic implications. In the present investigation, an orf outbreak was investigated in the Muzzaffarnagari sheep herd at the Central Goat Research Institute (CIRG), Makhdoom, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India. Primary cell culture of goat testes was used for the first time for the isolation of orf virus (ORFV). The identity of the virus was confirmed by amplification and sequence analysis of the major coat glycoprotein gene (B2L) and named ORFV/sheep/India/2012/CIRG. In phylogenetic analysis of the B2L protein gene, it was grouped with ORFV strains from China, suggesting that different ORFV strains circulate in India. Comparing nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid analysis (n = 63), a unique 126S residue was observed in ORFV/sheep/India/2012/CIRG. In further sequence analysis (B2L) of different ORFV strains (n = 63), some conserved amino acid residues were identified as host-specific (sheep, human, camel, takin, and muskox) and have been summarized. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"Kumar, N.;Wadhwa, A.;Chaubey, K.

1067,Hepatitis E virus: The current scenario,"Hepatitis E infection, caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV), is a common cause of acute hepatitis in developing countries with poor sanitation and hygiene conditions. The virus is classified into four genotypes (1-4) with one serotype. Genotypes 1 and 2 exclusively infect humans, while genotypes 3 and 4 also infect other animals, particularly pigs. In endemic areas, large outbreaks of acute hepatitis caused by genotype 1 or 2 viruses frequently occur due to fecal-oral transmission, usually through contaminated drinking water. With a high attack rate in young adults (ages 15-45), the disease is particularly severe among pregnant women (20-30% mortality). HEV appears to be a zoonotic disease, with transmission by pigs, wild boar and deer, or by food. Chronic infections are rare, except in immunosuppressed people, such as organ transplant recipients. A subunit vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing clinical disease but is not yet commercially available. Our understanding of HEV has undergone major changes in recent years and in this article we review currently available information regarding the molecular biology, pathobiology, and epidemiology of HEV infection. We also review current interventions and therapeutic strategies being used to control HEV infection, with an emphasis on potential approaches that could be used to develop an effective HEV vaccine. © 2012 International Society for Infectious Diseases.",,"Kumar, S.;Subhadra, S.;Singh, B.;Panda, B.

1068,"Complete sequencing and genomic characterization of the Bagaza, Kedougou and Zika viruses","Many members of the Flavivirus genus are the agents of important diseases of humans, livestock, and wildlife. Currently, a complete genome sequence is not available for the three African viruses, Bagaza, Zika and Kedougou viruses, each of which represents a distinct virus subgroup according to the latest virus classification. In this study, we obtained a complete genome sequence from each of these three viruses and characterized the open reading frames (ORFs) with respect to gene size, cleavage sites, potential glycosylation sites, distribution of cysteine and unique motifs. The sequences of the three viruses were then scanned over the full length of the ORF against the available sequences of other African flaviviruses and reference viruses selected for genetic relatedness. The data collectively indicated that Kedougou virus was close to dengue viruses but nonetheless distinct, while Bagaza virus shared a genetic relationship with West Nile virus in several genomic regions.

1069,Muscovy duck reovirus ÏƒC protein is atypically encoded by the smallest segment of the genome,"Although muscovy duck reovirus (DRV) shares properties with reovirus isolated from chicken, commonly called avian reovirus (ARV), the two virus species are antigenically different. Similar to the previously identified DRV-encoded gene ÏƒB (1201 bp long), the other three small segments of the DRV double-stranded RNA genome have been cloned and sequenced. They were 1325, 1191 and 1124 bp long, respectively, and contained conserved terminal sequences common to ARVs. They encoded single expression products except the smallest (S4), which contained two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2). BLAST analyzes revealed that the proteins encoded by the 1325 and 1191 bp genes shared high levels of identity with ARV ÏƒA and ÏƒNS, respectively, and to a lesser extent with other homologous orthoreoviruses. No homology was found for the p10 protein encoded by S4 ORF1. The 29.4-kDa product encoded by S4 ORF2 appeared to be 25% identical to ÏƒC encoded by ARV S1 ORF3, a cell-binding oligomer that induces type-specific neutralizing antibodies. The introduction of large gaps in the N-terminal part of the DRV protein was necessary to improve the amino acid sequence alignments of DRV and ARV ÏƒC. However, a leucine zipper motif was conserved and secondary structure analyzes predicted a characteristic three-stranded α-helical coiled coil at this amino portion. Therefore, despite the wide sequence divergence, DRV ÏƒC was suggested to be structurally and probably functionally related to ARV ÏƒC. This work provides evidence for the diversity of the S-class polycistronic genes of reoviruses isolated from birds and raises the question of the relative classification of DRV in the genus Orthoreovirus.",,"Kuntz-Simon, G.;Le Gall-ReculÃ©, G.;de BoissÃ©son, C.;Jestin, V.",2002.0,,,0
1070,"Comparative metagenomic profile of symbiotic bacterial communities associated with ticks Ixodes persulcatus, Ixodes pavlovskyi and Dermacentor reticulatus","Ixodes persulcatus, Ixodes pavlovskyi, and Dermacentor reticulatus ticks inhabiting western Siberia are responsible for the transmission of various etiologic agents that cause tick-borne diseases in humans and animals. Because these ticks are abundant in the suburbs of large cities, agricultural areas, and popular tourist sites and frequently attack people and livestock, data on the microbiomes of these organisms are required. Using 16S metagenomic profiling, we evaluated bacterial communities associated with I. persulcatus, I. pavlovskyi, and D. reticulatus ticks collected in the Novosibirsk region of Russia. A total of 1214 ticks were used for this study. The DNA extracted from the ticks was grouped according to the species and sex of the tick. Sequencing of the V3-V5 domains of the 16S rRNA genes was performed using the Illumina Miseq platform. The following bacterial genera were prevalent in the communities examined: Acinetobacter (all three tick species), Rickettsia (I. persulcatus and D. reticulatus), and Francisella (D. reticulatus). B. burgdorferi sensu lato and B. miyamotoi sequences were detected in I. persulcatus and I. pavlovskyi but not in D. reticulatus ticks. The pooled samples of all tick species studied contained bacteria from the Anaplasmataceae family, although their presence was low. DNA from A. phagocytophilum and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis was first observed in I. pavlovskyi ticks. Significant interspecies differences in the number of bacterial taxa were observed, as well as diversity within species related to tick sex. Bacterial communities associated with I. pavlovskyi ticks showed higher biodiversity compared to those of I. persulcatus and D. reticulatus ticks. Bacterial community structure was also diverse among the tick species studied, as demonstrated by permutational analysis of variance using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric (p = 0.002). The variation between sexes was confirmed by the PERMANOVA test in ticks I. persulcatus (p = 0.042) and I. pavlovskyi (p = 0.042).

The relationship between the former and recurrent viruses is unclear. To determine the molecular epizootiology of relapsing LPAI, we performed a phylogenetic analysis with partial nucleotide sequences of four gene segments (HA, NA, NP, and PB2) from eight H9N2 viruses of chicken origin. Recurrent H9N2 viruses showed greater nucleotide similarity in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes with the 1996 Korean isolates than with other Eurasian viruses, and formed a distinct group with early Korean isolates and some isolates from migratory and domestic ducks in Japan and China. Phylogenetic analysis with internal genes showed that some Korean isolates formed a group with other subtypes, such as H5N1, H6N1, and H6N2 in China and Taiwan.

The objective of this study was to determine the susceptibility and pathogenesis of domestic chickens and ducks to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/Whooper Swan/Mongolia/224/05 (H5N1) virus when administered through the respiratory or dietary exposure routes. Chickens and ducks were more susceptible to H5N1 HPAI virus, as evidenced by low infectious and lethal viral doses, when challenged by the intranasal route compared to food inoculation routes (infected chicken meat fed intragastrically or orally). In the dietary exposure pathogenesis study, pathologic changes included hemorrhage, necrosis, and inflammation in association with virus detection. These changes were generally observed in most of the visceral organs of chickens, between 2 and 4 days post-inoculation (DPI), and are similar to the lesions and localization of the virus observed in birds in natural cases or in experimental studies by the intranasal route. Food exposure to the virus caused a systemic infection in ducks, characterized by moderate lymphocytic encephalitis, necrotizing hepatitis, and pancreatitis with corresponding demonstration of virus within lesions. In both chickens and ducks with dietary exposure, lesions, virus, or both were first demonstrated in the upper alimentary tract at 1 DPI, suggesting that the alimentary tract was the initial site affected by consumption of infected meat or by virus probe in liquid medium. . However, as demonstrated in the chicken infectivity study, dietary infection required higher exposure doses to produce infection compared to intranasal exposure in chickens. These data suggest that upper respiratory tract exposure to H5N1 HPAI virus in poultry is more likely to result in infection and transmission of the virus than is consumption of infected meat, unless the latter contains high doses of virus, such as those they are found in cannibalized infected carcasses. © American Association of Avian Pathologists 2010.",,"Kwon, Y.

Our main objectives were to clarify the occurrence of the three SIV subtypes: H1N1 , H3N2 and H1N2. - at the regional level, to identify new reassortant viruses and antigenically compare SIVs with human influenza viruses H1N1 and H3N2. Lung tissue and/or nasal swabs from outbreaks of acute respiratory disease in pigs were investigated by virus isolation. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were determined using standard methods. Of the total 169 viruses, 81 were classified as avian-type H1N1, 36 as human-type H3N2, and 47 as human-type H1N2. Only five new reassortant viruses were identified: two H1N1 viruses had a human-type HA and three H1N2 viruses had an avian-type HA. All three SIV subtypes were detected in Belgium, Italy and Spain, while H1N1 and H1N2 viruses were only found in the UK and north-western France. Cross-hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests with hyperimmune sera against selected ancient and recent human influenza viruses showed a strong antigenic relationship between human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses from the 1980s and human-like SIVs H1N2 and H3N2, which confirms their common origin.

They were propagated in embryonated ovules and used for Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq DNA/RNA sequencing. The RNA sequences of these viruses published in NCBI were used as references for the alignment of the generated sequencing reads in this study. The consensus sequences of these viruses differed from NCBI-deposited sequences by several nucleotides. The 121XP stock derived by reverse genetics was more heterogeneous than the X-179A and X-181 stocks prepared by conventional reassortment technology. The past 121XP virus contained four non-synonymous mutations in the HA gene. One of these mutations (Lys226Glu) was located in the Ca antigenic site of HA (present in 18% of the population). Two non-synonymous mutations were present in HA of X-179A-derived viruses: Pro314Gln (18%) and Asn146Asp (78%).

The Simbu serogroup of the genus Orthobunyavirus, family Bunyaviridae, is an example. The Simbu serogroup currently consists of a highly diverse group of related arboviruses that infect both humans and economically important livestock species. Here, we report complete genome sequences for 11 viruses within this group, with a focus on the large and poorly characterized Manzanilla and Oropouche species complexes. Phylogenetic and pairwise divergence analyzes indicated the presence of high levels of genetic diversity within these two species complexes, on a par with that observed among the other five species complexes in the Simbu serogroup. Based on previously reported cross-species divergence thresholds, the data suggested that these two complexes should actually be split into at least five species. Together, these five species formed a phylogenetic clade distinct from the rest of the Simbu serogroup. The pairwise sequence divergences between viruses in this clade and viruses in other Simbu serogroup species complexes were similar to the levels of divergence between the other orthobunyavirus serogroups.

1082,Characterization of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses isolated from domestic poultry in China,"The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus has caused several outbreaks in domestic birds. Despite great efforts to control the spread of this virus, it continues to evolve and poses a substantial threat to public health due to a high mortality rate. In this study, we sequenced complete genomes of eight H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated from domestic poultry in eastern China and compared them with those of typical influenza virus strains. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that all eight genomes belonged to clade 2.3.2.1 and clade 7.2, the two main clades circulating in China. Viruses that clustered in clade 2.3.2.1 shared a high degree of homology with H5N1 isolates located in East Asia. Isolates that clustered in clade 7.2 were found to circulate throughout China, with a density gradient from east to west. Pathogenicity studies in mice showed that these isolates replicate in the lungs, with clade 2.3.2.1 viruses showing a markedly higher degree of virulence compared to clade 7.2 viruses. Our results contribute to the elucidation of the biological characterization and pathogenicity of HPAI H5N1 viruses.",,"Lai, C. C.;Wang, K. Y.;Chen, R.;Zhang, A. J.;Gu, H. J.;Yin, Y. B.;Wang, D.

1084,"Real-time PCR method for the simultaneous detection, quantification and differentiation of capripoxvirus","The genus Capripoxvirus (CaPV) comprises three members, namely Sheep Pox Virus (SPPV), Goat Pox Virus (GTPV) and Lumpy Skin Disease Virus (LSDV) which affects sheep, goats and cattle, respectively. CaPV infections produce similar symptoms in sheep and goats, and the three viruses cannot be distinguished serologically. Since there are conflicting opinions regarding the host specificity of CaPVs, particularly for goat pox and sheep pox viruses, the development of rapid genotyping tools will facilitate more accurate diagnosis and surveillance of the disease for a better management of capripox outbreaks. This article describes a species-specific, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on unique molecular markers found in the G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor (GPCR) gene sequences of PCa, which uses dual hybridization probes for simultaneous analysis. detection, quantification and genotyping. The assay can differentiate between CaPV strains based on differences in melting point temperature (Tm) obtained after fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA). It is very sensitive and has low intra- and inter-assay variation. This real-time PCR assay will make a significant contribution to CaPV diagnosis and a better understanding of CaPV epidemiology by enabling rapid genotyping and gene-based classification of viral strains and unequivocal identification of isolates. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",,"Lamien, C.

This article presents the results of an epidemiological survey of pestiviruses circulating in cattle in southern Italy. Molecular assays performed on a total of 924 bovine samples detected 74 BVDV strains, including 73 BVDV-1 and 1 BVDV-2 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis performed on partial 5â€²UTR and Npro sequences revealed the presence of 6 different subtypes of BVDV-1 and a single strain of BVDV-2c.

1087,Nuevos bocaparvovirus en conejos,"Bocaparvovirus is a recently established genus within the Parvoviridae family and has been identified as a possible cause of enteric, respiratory, reproductive/neonatal, and neurological disease in humans and various animal species. In this study, metagenomic analysis was used to identify and characterize a new bocaparvovirus in the feces of rabbits with enteric disease. To assess the prevalence of the new virus, rectal swabs and fecal samples obtained from rabbits with and without diarrhea were tested with a specific PCR assay. The complete genome sequence of the new parvovirus was reconstructed. The virus was distantly related to other bocaparvoviruses; the three ORFs shared 53%, 53%, and 50% nucleotide identity, respectively, with homologous porcine bocaparvovirus genes. Virus was detected in 8/29 (28%) and 16/95 (17%) samples from rabbits with and without diarrhea, respectively. Sequencing of the diagnostic PCR target capsid protein fragment identified two distinct populations/subtypes of bocaparvovirus, with 91.7-94.5% nucleotide identity to each other.

1088,Avian flu: the eradication of commercial birds is not yet in sight,"Avian influenza viruses are highly infectious organisms that primarily affect birds. However, they have also been isolated from various mammals, including humans. The avian influenza virus can cause great economic losses to the poultry industry due to its high mortality. Although pathogenic variants exist with low virulence and generally cause mild clinical symptoms, if any, the H5 and H7 subtypes can mutate from low virulence to highly virulent (pathogenic) viruses and should be considered in eradication strategies. The main source of infection for commercial birds is direct and indirect contact with wild birds, with waterfowl being a natural reservoir of the virus. Live bird markets, exotic birds, and ostriches also play an important role in the epidemiology of avian influenza. Secondary transmission (ie, between poultry farms) of avian influenza viruses is attributed primarily to fomites and people. Airborne transmission is also important, and the virus can be spread by aerosol in humans. Diagnostic tests detect viral proteins and genes. Virus-specific antibodies can be traced by serological tests, virus isolation and identification being complementary procedures. The number of avian influenza outbreaks appears to be increasing: in the last 5 years, outbreaks have been reported in Italy, Hong Kong, Chile, the Netherlands, South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, China, Pakistan . , United States of America, Canada, South Africa and Malaysia. In addition, a growing number of human cases of avian influenza, some fatal, have paralleled outbreaks in commercial poultry. There is great concern that a new virus subtype with pandemic potential could emerge from these outbreaks. From a human health perspective, eradicating the virus from birds is critical; however, the large number of small poultry farms, lack of control expertise and resources, and the international scale of transmission and infection make rapid control and long-term prevention of recurrence extremely difficult. In the western world, renewed interest in free range housing carries with it a threat of future outbreaks. The growing ethical objections to mass culling of birds require a different approach to the eradication of avian influenza.",,"Landman, W. J. M.;Schrier, C. C.",2004.0,,,0
1089,Three new canine papillomaviruses support the formation of taxonomic clades,"More than 100 human papillomaviruses (HPVs) have been identified and their complete genomes sequenced. Most of these HPVs can be classified into three distinct genera, alpha, beta, and gamma papillomaviruses (PVs). Of note, only one or a small number of PVs have been identified for each individual animal species. However, four canine PVs (CPVs) (COPV, CPV2, CPV3 and CPV4) have been described and their full genomic sequences have been published. Based on their sequence similarities, they belong to three distinct clades. In the present study, circular viral DNA was amplified from three dogs showing signs of pigmented plaques, endophytic papilloma, or squamous cell carcinoma in situ. DNA sequence analysis suggested that these are three new viruses (CPV5, CPV6, and CPV7) whose genomes comprise all known conserved PV sequence elements. The genomes of these seven CPVs were compared to classify them properly. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses, as well as pairwise sequence alignments of the putative amino acid sequences, revealed that CPV5 clustered well with CPV3 and CPV4, while CPV7 clustered with CPV2, but neither cluster fit with other classified PVs. . However, CPV6 clustered with COPV, a lambda-PV. Based on this evidence, the assignment of CPVs into three distinct clades could be supported. Thus, like the HPVs, it could be that the known and currently unknown CPVs are related and form only a few clades or genera. © 2009 SGM.",,"Lange, C.

1090,Tick-borne viruses: a review from the perspective of therapeutic approaches,"Several major human diseases worldwide are caused by tick-borne viruses. These diseases have become important public health problems in recent years. Tick-borne viruses that cause human disease mainly belong to 3 families: Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Reoviridae. In this review, we focus on therapeutic approaches for several of the most important tick-borne viruses in these 3 families. These viruses are Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHF) and the recently discovered tick-borne phleboviruses known as thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), Heartland virus and Bhanja virus of the family Bunyaviridae, encephalitis virus tick-borne virus (TBEV), Powassan virus (POWV), Louping-ill virus (LIV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV), Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), and of Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHFV) of the Flaviviridae family. To date, there is no effective antiviral drug available against most of these tick-borne viruses. Although there is common use of antiviral drugs such as ribavirin for the treatment of HCC in some countries, there is concern that ribavirin is not as effective as previously thought against HCC. Here, we also discuss the availability of vaccines to control these viral infections. The lack of treatment and prevention approaches for these viruses is highlighted, and we hope that this review can increase public health awareness regarding the threat posed by this group of viruses. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.",,"Lani, R.;Moghaddam, E.;Haghani, A.;Chang, L.

Here we isolate phage B8b from the Mediterranean Sea using Pseudoalteromonas sp. QC-44 as a host and characterize it using countless techniques. Morphologically, phage B8b was classified as a member of the Siphoviridae family. One-step growth analyzes showed that this sifovirus had a latency period of 70 min and released 172 new virus particles per cell. Host range analysis against 89 bacterial host strains revealed that phage B8b infected 3 Pseudoalteromonas strains (52 tested, >99.9% nucleotide identity of the 16S rRNA gene) and 1 non-Pseudoalteromonas strain belonging to Alteromonas sp. (37 strains from 6 genera tested), which helps to delineate the possible phylogenetic distance in a phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer event. The genome size of Pseudoalteromonas phage B8b was 42.7 kb, with clear structural and replication modules where the former were delineated leveraging the identification of 16 structural genes by virion structural proteomics, only 4 of which had any similarity. with known structural proteins.

1092,Blood transcriptomes reveal new parasitic zoonoses circulating in Madagascar lemurs,"Zoonotic diseases are an imminent threat to global populations, and nearly 75% of emerging infectious diseases can spread between wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. The 'One World, One Health' perspective offers us an ideal framework for understanding and potentially mitigating the spread of zoonoses, and the island of Madagascar serves as a natural laboratory for these studies. Rapid habitat degradation and climate change on the island are contributing to more frequent contact between humans, livestock, and wildlife, increasing the potential for pathogen-spreading events. Given Madagascar's long geographic isolation, coupled with recent and repeated introductions of agricultural and invasive species, it is likely that several circulating pathogens remain uncharacterized in lemur populations. Therefore, it is imperative that new approaches to de novo pathogen discovery be implemented. To this end, we used deep untargeted sequencing of blood transcriptomes from two critically endangered wild lemur species (Indri indri and Propithecus diadema) to characterize bloodborne pathogens. Our results show several undescribed vector-borne parasites circulating within lemurs, some of which can cause disease in wildlife, livestock, and humans.

To explore the diversity of deltacoronaviruses in animals in the Middle East, we analyzed fecal samples from 1,356 mammals and birds in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Four new deltacoronaviruses from eight birds of four species were detected by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR): FalCoV UAE-HKU27 from a falcon, HouCoV UAE-HKU28 from a houbara bustard, PiCoV UAE-HKU29 from a dove, and QuaCoV UAE - HKU30 of five quail. Whole genome sequencing showed that FalCoV UAE-HKU27, HouCoV UAE-HKU28, and PiCoV UAE-HKU29 belong to the same CoV species, suggesting recent cross-species transmission between falcons and their prey, Houbara bustards and pigeons, possibly to throughout the food chain. Western blotting detected specific anti-FalCoV UAE-HKU27 antibodies in 33 (75%) of 44 falcon serum samples, supporting genuine infection in falcons after virus acquisition. QuaCoV UAE-HKU30 belongs to the same CoV species as porcine coronavirus HKU15 (PorCoV HKU15) and sparrow coronavirus HKU17 (SpCoV HKU17), previously discovered in pigs and tree sparrows, respectively, supporting bird-to-pig transmission. Recombination involving the spike protein is common among deltacoronaviruses, which may facilitate interspecies transmission. FalCoV UAE-HKU27, HouCoV UAE-HKU28 and PiCoV UAE-HKU29 originated from recombination between white-eye coronavirus HKU16 (WECoV HKU16) and magpie coronavirus HKU18 (MRCoV HKU18), QuaCoV UAE-HKU30 from recombination between PorCoV HKU15/SpCoV HKU17 and munia coronavirus HKU13 (MunCoV HKU13), and PorCoV HKU15 from recombination between SpCoV HKU17 and bulbul coronavirus HKU11 (BuCoV HKU11).

Genome analysis revealed evidence of recent interspecies transmission between falcons and their prey, houbara bustards, and pigeons, possibly along the food chain, as well as transmission from birds to pigs. Recombination, which is known to occur frequently in some coronaviruses, was also common among these deltacoronaviruses and occurred predominantly in the spike region. Such recombination, in which receptor-binding protein is involved, may contribute to the emergence of new viruses capable of infecting new hosts.

1097,Chickens harbor various picornaviruses originating from possible interspecies transmission with recombination,"Although chickens are an important reservoir for emerging pathogens such as avian influenza viruses, little is known about the diversity of picornaviruses in poultry. We discovered a previously unknown diversity of picornaviruses in chickens in Hong Kong. Picornaviruses were detected in 87 cloacal and 7 tracheal samples from 93 of 900 chickens by reverse transcription PCR, with their partial 3Dpol gene sequences forming five distinct clades (I to V) among known picornaviruses. Analysis of eight genomes from different clades revealed seven different picornaviruses, including six new picornavirus species (clade I ChPV1, clade II ChPV2 and ChPV3, clade III ChPV4 and ChPV5, clade IV ChGV1) and one existing species (clade IV). clade V avian encephalomyelitis). The six new chicken picornavirus genomes exhibited distinct phylogenetic positions and different genomic features from related picornaviruses, supporting their classification as separate species. Furthermore, ChPV1 may potentially belong to a new genus, with low sequence homologies to related picornaviruses, especially in the P1 and P2 regions, including the predicted L and 2A proteins. However, these new picornaviruses were more closely related to picornaviruses from other bird species (ChPV1 related to Passerivirus A, ChPV2 and ChPV3 to Avisivirus A and duck hepatitis A virus, ChPV4 and ChPV5 to Melegrivirus A). , ChGV1 with Gallivirus A).

Their phylogenetic relationships were established using parsimony and neighbor-joining methods. Four lineages (PRRSV, LDV, SHFV and EAV) were discriminated. Two genotypes of PRRSV, European and American, could also be identified. The European PRRSV genotype was highly conserved. Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions in PRRSV ORF7 revealed four stable regions, likely conserved due to their requirement for nucleocapsid function and/or structure. Accumulation of constant mutations in ORF7 could not be accurately determined when either synonymous or non-synonymous mutations were studied. Passage of European PRRSV in vivo had little influence on the sequence of ORF7: only a small number of synonymous substitutions in ORF7 were detected, confirming its low variability.

1102,Heterogeneity and genetic variations of serotypes O and Asia 1 of foot-and-mouth disease viruses isolated in Vietnam,"Six FMDV field viruses, including four serotype O and two serotype Asia 1 strains, were collected from endemic outbreaks in 2005, 2006 and 2007 in four different provinces of Vietnam. The viruses were isolated and genetically characterized by their complete genomic sequences. Genetic analysis based on the complete genome coding sequences revealed that the four serotype O FMD viruses were related to each other, sharing 95.2% nucleotide (nt) identity and 95.2% amino acid (aa) identity. 97.5-97.6%. Genetic analysis and a phylogenetic tree, based on the FMD virus VP1 gene, showed that the four Vietnamese serotype O strains present have a high level of identity with other serotype O representatives of the Mya-98 lineage of the topotype of the Southeast Asia (SEA). The four viruses were all clustered in the Mya-98 lineage of the SEA topotype, sharing 92.3-95.6% nt and 93.4-96.7% aa identity. This finding of the Mya-98 lineage was different from previous reports that Vietnamese serotype O strains belonged to the Cam-94 lineage of the SEA topotype and two other topotypes, Middle East-South Asia (ME-SA) and Cathay. For the two FMDV serotypes Asia 1, genetic analysis based on the complete genomic coding sequences as well as the VP1 gene revealed that they belonged to two genogroups, IV and V. It should be noted that the As1/VN strain Genogroup V /QT03/2007, isolated in 2007, was closely related to the Asia 1 pandemic strain that caused outbreaks of FMD in China (Asia1/WHN/CHA/06, FJ906802) and Mongolia (Asia1/MOG/05, EF614458) in 2005, sharing 99.0-99.3% nt and 99.5-100% aa identity. In contrast, the second genogroup IV strain As1/VN/LC04/2005, isolated in 2005, was closely related to all Asia 1 strains of the Vietnamese serotype referenced in GenBank databases, sharing 86.4-100% nt and 90.9-100% aa. identity with each.

1104,Sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin gene of Korean avian influenza H9N2 viruses and evaluation of the pathogenic potential of isolate MS96,"Sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of five H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) isolates from Korea showed that these viruses were closely related and possibly from the same source. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA1 subunit of H9 subtype isolates revealed that Korean AIV isolates were different from isolates from Hong Kong poultry markets in 1997. None of the Korean AIVs had multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site of HA that confer high pathogenicity to some H5 and H7 AIVs. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleoprotein and matrix gene demonstrated that Korean isolates cluster with AIV of Eurasian origin. The pathogenic potential of one of the isolates (MS96) was evaluated after several passages in 14-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (ECE). ECE derivatives of fourteen-day-old MS96 showed increased HA titer and embryo mortality in eggs; this was evident after the third step of 14-day CEE. Sequence analysis of the MS96 cleavage site after the third and tenth passage in 14-day CEE revealed no amino acid sequence changes. The pathogenicity of MS96 after the 10th passage in 14-day-old eggs (MS96p10(ECE14)) was tested in 4-week-old specific pathogen-free chickens. The 14-day derivative, MS96p10(ECE14), showed broader tissue tropism and induced more severe clinical signs than the parent virus. Furthermore, after intranasal inoculation of 86-week-old broiler breeders and 30-week-old layers, the MS96p10 (ECE14) derivative induced more severe signs of depression than the parent virus, as well as a transient drop in egg production.",,"Lee, C.

1106,Characterization of low pathogenicity H5 and H7 Korean avian influenza viruses in chickens,"To date, all isolated highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses known to cause systemic infection with a high mortality rate in poultry species belong to the H5 or H7 subtypes. HPAI viruses may originate due to the insertion of multiple basic amino acids into the hemagglutinin protein cleavage site after low pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses have been introduced into poultry. In the present study, we investigated the phylogenetic characteristics of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5 (n = 4) and H7 (n = 3) viruses isolated from wild birds in Korea by using nucleotide sequences of the 8 gene segments of the viral genome. Furthermore, we evaluated the infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenic potential of these viruses in chickens. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all viruses used in the study clustered in the Eurasian lineage and were similar to viruses isolated in Asian countries that share the flight path of East Asian and Australasian migratory birds. Our H5N2 isolates were unable to replicate and transmit in chickens, but the H7N8 isolates were able to efficiently replicate and transmit to contact-exposed chickens. Furthermore, because our H7N8 isolates caused watery diarrhea in chickens, these viruses may not only serve as progenitors of new HPAI strains, but may also cause clinical disease in poultry. Although there have been no reports of mutation from LPAI to HPAI in these regions, wild bird surveillance effort should focus on monitoring the introduction and transmission of HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H5 and H7 viruses. © 2012 Poultry Science Association Inc.",,"Lee, D.

Surveillance within the 10 km control zone identified low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H7N8 in nine surrounding turkey flocks, but not in other facilities affected by HPAIV. We sequenced four of the H7N8 HPAIVs isolated from a single farm and nine LPAIVs identified during control zone surveillance.

Thirteen and 1 NDV isolates were classified into lentegenic and velogenic viruses, respectively, based on in vivo pathogenicity tests. Twelve lentegenic viruses showed HA activity in horse red blood cells, while 1 lentegenic virus and velogenic virus were negative. Lentegenic viruses (n = 13) had sequence motifs of 112ERQERL117 (n = 1) or 112GRQGRL117 (n = 12) at the F0 cleavage site, while velogenic viruses (n = 1) had a sequence motif of 112RRQKRF117 At the same place. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that at least three distinct genotypes may exist in Korean domestic ducks; one class I genotype (genotype 2) and two class II genotypes (genotypes I and VII). The class I virus was most closely related to the genotype 2 strains that were isolated from birds in the US, Germany, and Denmark. Twelve class II-lentogenic viruses were grouped into genotype I and then divided into at least three groups, namely Aomori-type, Ulster2C-type and V4-type. Class II velogenic virus was assigned to genotype VII, which represents viruses responsible for recent epidemics in many Asian countries, including Korea.

1113,"The genome sequence of Yaba-like illness virus, a yatapoxvirus","The genome sequence of Yaba-like disease virus (YLDV), an unclassified member of the yatapoxvirus genus, has been determined. Excluding terminal hairpin loops, the YLDV genome is 144,575 bp in length and contains 1883 bp inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). Within the 20 nucleotide ends is a sequence that is conserved in other poxviruses and is required for the resolution of concatemeric replicative DNA intermediates. The nucleotide composition of the genome is 73% A+T, but the ITRs are only 63% A+T. The genome contains 151 tightly packed open reading frames (ORFs) that are 180 nucleotides long or conserved in other poxviruses. ORFs within 23 kb of each end are transcribed toward the ends, while ORFs within the central region of the genome encode on either strand of DNA. In the core region, the ORFs have conserved position, orientation, and sequence compared to vaccinia virus ORFs and encode many enzymes, transcription factors, or structural proteins. In contrast, the ORFs near the ends are more divergent and in seven cases have no equivalents in other poxviruses. The YLDV genome encodes several predicted immunomodulators; Examples include two proteins with similarity to CC chemokine receptors and predicted secreted proteins with similarity to MHC class I antigen, OX-2, interleukin-10/mda-7, poxvirus growth factor, serpins, and a protein of binding to type I interferon.

1114,Generation of reassortant influenza viruses within the non-industrial poultry system,"We compared the genetic and biological characteristics of 35 influenza viruses from different epidemiological backgrounds in Korea, including H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that chicken-adapted H9N2 viruses (A/chicken/Korea/96006/96 [CK/Kor/96006-like]) acquired waterfowl gene segments through reassortment, and these reassortant H9N2 viruses they were most frequently detected in minor poultry species. than from industrial poultry farming. In contrast, CK/Kor/96006-like virus gene segments were also detected in most domestic duck viruses. Interestingly, domestic ducks, rather than wild waterfowl, harbored close relatives of all eight H3N2 CIV gene segments, which preferred to bind to avian receptors. Therefore, bidirectional virus transmission events between terrestrial and aquatic poultry are presumed to have occurred, particularly within the non-industrial poultry system. These events have contributed to the generation of a new rearrangement, H3N2 CIV. To avoid the generation of other rearrangements capable of interspecies transmission, gene movements in non-industrial poultry systems must be elucidated and managed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",,"Lee, H.

Classically, the interaction between NP and viral RNA (vRNA) is represented as a uniform pattern of ""beads on a string"". Using high-throughput sequencing of isolated RNA using cross-link immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP), we identified the NP vRNA binding profiles for two H1N1 IAV strains in virions. Contrary to the prevailing model for vRNA packaging, NP does not bind vRNA uniformly in strains A/WSN/1933 and A/California/07/2009, rather each segment of vRNA exhibits a unique binding profile, containing binding sites. rich or poor. in NP association. Interestingly, both H1N1 strains have similar but distinct NP-binding profiles despite extensive sequence conservation. Peaks identified by HITS-CLIP were verified as true NP binding sites based on insensitivity to DNA antisense oligonucleotide-mediated RNase H digestion. Furthermore, analysis of the nucleotide content of the NP peaks revealed that these sites are relatively G-rich and U-poor compared to the nucleotide content of the entire genome, indicating an as yet unidentified sequence bias for the nucleotide.

1119,First complete sequencing of the infectious laryngotracheitis virus genome,"Background: Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) is an alphaherpesvirus that causes acute respiratory disease in chickens worldwide. To date, only one complete ILTV genomic sequence has been reported. This sequence was generated by concatenating partial sequences from six different ILTV strains. Therefore, the complete genomic sequence of a single (individual) strain of ILTV has not been previously determined. This study aimed to use high-throughput sequencing technology to determine the complete genomic sequence of a live attenuated vaccine strain of ILTV. Results: The complete genomic sequence of the Serva vaccine strain of ILTV was determined, annotated and compared with the concatenated reference sequence of ILTV. The genome size of the Serva strain was 152,628 bp, with a G+C content of 48%. A total of 80 predicted open reading frames were identified. The Serva strain had 96.5% DNA sequence identity with the concatenated ILTV sequence. In particular, the concatenated ILTV sequence was found to lack four large regions of sequence, including 528 bp and 594 bp of sequence in the UL29 and UL36 genes, respectively, and two copies of a 1563 bp sequence in the repeat regions. Considerable differences in the size of the predicted translation products of 4 other genes (UL54, UL30, UL37 and UL38) were also identified. More than 530 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Most of the SNPs were located within three genomic regions, corresponding to the SA-2 ILTV vaccine strain sequence in the concatenated ILTV sequence.

1120,Dicer-2 and Piwi-mediated RNA interference in mosquito cells infected with Rift Valley fever virus,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae) transmitted by mosquitoes. It infects humans and ruminants, causing dramatic epidemics and epizootics in Africa, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. Although recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the nonstructural protein NS as a major component of virulence in vertebrates, little is known about the infection of mosquito vectors. Here we studied RVFV infection in three different mosquito cell lines, Aedes aegypti Aag2 cells and Aedes albopictus U4.4 and C6/36 cells. Unlike mammalian cells, where NSs form nuclear filaments, U4.4 and Aag2 cells downregulated NS expression such that NS filaments never formed in the nuclei of U4.4 cells. and disappeared early after infection in the case of Aag2 cells. In contrast, in C6/36 cells, nuclear filaments of NSs were visible throughout the course of infection. Analysis of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (viRNAs) by deep sequencing indicated that viRNA production was very low in C6/36 cells, which are known to be deficient in Dicer-2 but expressed some viRNAs that exhibited a signature. Piwi. In contrast, Aag2 and U4.4 cells produced large amounts of viRNA predominantly matching the S segment and displaying Dicer-2 and Piwi signatures. While the 21-nucleotide (nt) Dicer-2 viRNAs were prominent during early infection, the 24- to 27-nt Piwi RNA (piRNA) population increased progressively and became predominant later during acute infection and during persistence. In Aag2 and U4.4 cells, the combined actions of the Dicer-2 and Piwi pathways triggered an efficient antiviral response that allowed, among other actions, to suppress the formation of NS filaments and allow the establishment of persistence. In C6/36 cells, Piwi-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) appeared to be sufficient to mount an antiviral response against a secondary infection with a superinfectious virus. This study provides new insights into the role of Dicer and Piwi in mosquito antiviral defense and the development of the antiviral response in mosquitoes.",,"Leger, P.;Lara, E.;Jagla, B.;Sismeiro, O.;Mansuroglu, Z.;Coppee, J.

1121,Exploring the contribution of bacteriophages to antibiotic resistance,"Bacteriophages (phages) are the most abundant and diverse biological entities on our planet. They infect susceptible bacterial hosts where they multiply or persist. In the latter case, phages can confer new functions to their hosts as a result of gene transfer, thus contributing to their adaptation (short term) and evolution (long term). In this sense, the role of phages in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among bacterial hosts in natural environments has not yet been clearly resolved. Here we carry out a comprehensive analysis of thirty-three viromes from different habitats to investigate whether phages harbor ARGs. Our results demonstrate that while human-associated viromes do not or rarely carry ARGs, viromes from nonhuman sources (eg, pig feces, raw sewage, and freshwater and marine environments) contain ARGs. a large pool of ARGs, indicating that phages could play a part in spreading antibiotic resistance.

1123,Nucleotide sequence analysis and expression of recombinant vectors demonstrate that the binding G protein of bovine respiratory syncytial virus is distinct from that of human respiratory syncytial virus,"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRS) causes severe lower respiratory tract disease in calves similar to the disease in children caused by human respiratory syncytial virus (HRS). Although there is antigenic cross-reactivity between the other major viral structural proteins, the major glycoprotein, G, of BRS virus and that of HRS virus are antigenically distinct. Glycoprotein G has been implicated as a binding protein for the HRS virus. We have carried out a molecular comparison of BRS virus glycoprotein G with its HRS virus counterparts. cDNA clones corresponding to BRS virus glycoprotein G mRNA were isolated and analyzed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. BRS G virus mRNA contained 838 unique poly(A) nucleotides and had a major open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 257 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of the BRS virus G polypeptide showed only 29 to 30% of amino acids with the HRS virus G protein of subgroup A or B. However, despite this low level of identity, there were strong similarities in the Predicted hydropathy profiles of BRS virus and HRS virus G proteins. A cDNA molecule containing the major G open reading frame of the entire BRS virus was inserted into the vaccinia virus thymidine kinase gene by homologous recombination, and a recombinant virus containing the G protein gene of the virus was isolated. BRS. This recombinant virus expressed BRS virus G protein, as demonstrated by Western immunoblot and immunofluorescence analysis of infected cells. BRS virus G protein expressed from the recombinant vector was carried and expressed on the surface of infected cells. Antisera against BRS virus G protein made using the recombinant vector to immunize animals recognized BRS virus binding protein but not HRS virus G protein and vice versa, confirming the lack of antigenic cross-reactivity between the proteins. BRS and HRS virus binding. On the basis of the data presented here, we conclude that BRS virus should be classified within the genus Pneumovirus in a separate group from HRS virus and that it is no more closely related to HRS virus subgroup A than to HRS virus subgroup B.",,"Lerch, R.

A quantitative real-time PCR assay was developed to detect and classify bovine viral diarrhea viruses into genotypes I and II. A pair of primers specific for highly conserved regions of the 5â€²UTR and two TaqMan probes were designed. The FAM and VIC labeled probe sequences differed by three nucleotides, allowing differentiation between genotype I and II. The detectability of the genotype I and II real-time PCR assay was 1000 and 100 copies, respectively. Highly reproducible data were obtained as the inter-assay coefficients of variation of the threshold cycle values were less than 2.2%.

1125,Detection and genotyping of bovine diarrhea virus by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain amplification of the 5' untranslated region,"Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed to differentiate bovine diarrhea virus (BVDV) from other pestiviruses and to genotype BVDV isolates. For this, pairs of primers were selected in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). Primers B(E) and B2 were located in highly conserved regions and were pestivirus specific. Two primer pairs designated B3B4 and B5B6 were specific for BVDV genotypes I and II, respectively. With this technique, an amplification product of the expected size was obtained with primer pairs B3B4 or B5B6 for all 107 BVDV isolates tested, but not for BDV or CSFV. For some isolates that were grouped in genotype II, the sequence analysis of the PCR fragments confirmed their classification in this genotype.",,"Letellier, C.;Kerkhofs, P.;Wellemans, G.;Vanopdenbosch, E.",1999.0,,10.1016/s0378-1135(98)00267-3,0
1126,Avian Influenza Virus Surveillance in Wild Birds in Georgia: 2009-2011,"The Caucasus, on the border of Europe and Asia, is important for the migration and wintering of wild waterfowl. Three migratory routes, the Central Asian, East African-West Asian, and Mediterranean/Black Sea migratory routes, converge in the Caucasus region. Therefore, the Caucasus region could act as a migratory bridge for influenza virus transmission when birds aggregate in high concentrations in post-breeding, migratory and winter periods. Since August 2009, we have established a surveillance network for influenza viruses in wild birds, utilizing five geographically distributed sampling areas in suitable habitats in both eastern and western Georgia. We took paired tracheal and cloacal swabs and fresh stool samples. We collected 8343 swabs from 76 species belonging to 17 families in 11 bird orders, of which 84 were positive by real-time RT-PCR for avian influenza virus (AIV). No highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) H5 or H7 viruses were detected. The overall prevalence of AIV was 1.6%. We observed a maximum prevalence in large gulls during the fall migration (5.3-9.8%), but a maximum prevalence in black-headed gulls in spring (4.2-13%). In ducks, we observed a higher prevalence of AIV during the post-fall molt aggregations and migration stoppage period (6.3%), but at lower levels than those observed in other post-molt areas further south. northern Eurasia. We observed another prevalence peak in the hibernation period (0.14-5.9%). Serological and virological monitoring of a breeding colony of Armenian Gulls showed that adult birds were seropositive on arrival at the breeding colony, but juveniles remained serologically and virologically negative for AIV throughout their time in the breeding areas, in contrast to AIV data from gulls from other geographic regions. regions. We show that the close phylogenetic relatives of the viruses isolated in Georgia come from a wide geographic area throughout western and central Eurasia, and from areas that are represented by multiple different migration routes, likely linking different host subpopulations. © 2013 Lewis et al.",,"Lewis, N.

1127,The evolution of foot-and-mouth disease virus: impacts of recombination and selection,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus is an economically important animal virus that exhibits great genetic and antigenic heterogeneity. To examine the evolutionary forces that have influenced the population dynamics of FMD virus, individual genes and coding genomes of the Eurasian serotypes (Asia1, A, C and O) were examined for phylogenetic relationships, recombination and genetic diversity. and selection. Our analyzes demonstrate that paraphyletic relationships between serotypes are not as frequent as previously proposed and suggest that convergent evolution might be obscuring phylogenetic relationships. We provide evidence that the identification of recombinant sequences and recombination breakpoint patterns between and within serotypes is highly dependent on the level of genetic diversity and convergent traits present in a particular data set, as well as on the methods used. used to detect recombination. Here, we also investigated the impact of adaptive positive selection on capsid proteins and nonstructural genes 2B, 2C, 3A, and 3Cpro to identify regions of the genome involved in genetic diversity and antigenic variation. Two different categories of positive selection were examined at the amino acid level; conservative (stabilizing) selection that maintains particular phenotypic properties of an amino acid residue and radical (destabilizing), and selection that dramatically alters the phenotype and potentially the functional and/or structural characteristics of the protein. Approximately 29% of the residues in the capsid proteins were under positive selection. Of them, 64% were under the influence of destabilizing selection, 80% were under the influence of stabilizing selection, and 44% had phenotypic properties influenced by both types of selection. Most of the residues under selection (74%) were located outside known antigenic sites; suggestive of additional uncharacterized epitopes and genomic regions involved in antigenic drift. © 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Lewis-Rogers, N.;McClellan, D.

1128,Close Relationship Between 2009 H1N1 Virus and South Dakota AIV Strains,"Although previous publications suggest that the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus reassorted from North American and Eurasian swine viruses, immediate ancestry remains elusive due to the large evolutionary distance between the 2009 H1N1 virus and previously isolated strains. Since the revelation of the 2009 H1N1 influenza, influenza has generated a great deal of interest, and as a result, a large number of influenza virus sequences have been deposited in public sequence databases. Blast analysis showed that the 2007 avian influenza virus strains from South Dakota and other recently reported avian strains from North America contained genetic segments closely related to the 2009 H1N1 virus, suggesting that these avian influenza viruses are relatives. closely related to the 2009 H1N1 virus. Phylogenetic analyzes also indicate that the 2009 H1N1 viruses are associated with avian and swine influenza viruses circulating in North America. Since migratory wild birds are preferred carriers to pigs for spreading influenza viruses over long distances, it is highly likely that birds played a major role in the intercontinental evolution of the 2009 H1N1 virus. Understanding the evolutionary pathway of the 2009 H1N1 virus is essential. emerging influenza virus to find a way to prevent new emerging cases.

Its high incidence may represent a potential threat to the pig industry worldwide. The processes that lead to the emergence and spread of PCV3 remain poorly understood. Herein, the possible origin, genotypes, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 are determined based on available genomic sequences. The closest ancestor of PCV3 is found to be within clade 1 bat CVs. Using different phylogenetic methods, two main genotypes, PCV3a and PCV3b, are identified. The effective population size of PCV3 is found to have increased rapidly between late 2013 and early 2014 and this is associated with the diversification of PCV3a and PCV3b. A relatively high effective reproductive number (Re) value and higher evolutionary rate were found compared to other single-stranded DNA viruses, and positive selection was identified at codons 122 and 320 (24 of ORF2). It is hypothesized that this, together with the prediction of a potential change in an antigenic epitope at position 320, might have allowed PCV3 to escape the host immune response. Overall, this study has important implications for understanding ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.",,"Li, G.;He, W.;Zhu, H.;Bi, Y.;Wang, R.;Xing, G.;Zhang, C.;Zhou, J.;Yuen, K.

The identified genes were named UL1, UL2, UL3, UL4, UL5, UL6, and UL7 homologues of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). The DEV UL3.5 located between UL3 and UL4 had no counterpart in the HSV-1. The arrangement and orientation of transcription of all eight genes were colinear with their counterparts in HSV-1. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the deduced amino acid alignments of eight proteins with their homologues in 12 alpha-herpesviruses. In the UL1, UL3, UL3.5, UL5, and UL7 protein trees, the branches were most closely related to the Mardivirus genus. However, the phylogenetic trees of the UL2, UL4, and UL6 proteins indicated a large distance from Mardivirus, indicating that DEV evolved differently from other viruses in the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily and formed a single branch within this subfamily.

1132,"Characterization of genes encoding duck enteritis virus (DEV) UL24, TK and gH proteins: a test for DEV classification","Duck enteritis virus (DEV) is classified in the family Herpesviridae, but has not been grouped in any genus so far. Four overlapping fragments of the DEV genome were amplified with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The assembled length of the four fragments was 6202 bp, containing the genes encoding single long protein (UL) 24, thymidine kinase (TK), and glycoprotein H (gH). UL24 overlapped with TK by 64 nucleotides (nt), in a head-to-head transcript orientation, and TK and gH had the same transcript orientation. Comparison of amino acid sequences of these 3 deduced DEV proteins with 12 other alphaherpesviruses showed 5 highly conserved sites in UL24, as well as 5 other consensus regions in TK and 4 consensus regions in gH. RNA polymerase II transcriptional control elements were identified in all DEV UL24, TK and gH. These elements included core promoters, TATA motifs, and polyadenylation sites. Phylogenetic analysis was calculated for the genetic classification of DEV in the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae with 12 other alphaherpesviruses. The result showed that DEV was more closely related to avian herpesviruses, except infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), than to other alphaherpesviruses. In conclusion, based on phylogenesis-based analysis and homology comparison of functional domains of UL24, TK, and gH, DEV should be classified in a separate genus of subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae in family Herpesviridae. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Li, H.;Liu, S.;Kong, X.",2006.0,,10.1007/s11262-005-0060-6,0

This study attempts to address the underlying secondary mechanisms after AIV H9N2 infection. Initially, nine-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens were assigned to control (uninfected) and H9N2-infected groups, respectively. Using Illumina sequencing, histological examination, and quantitative real-time PCR, H9N2 AIV was found to cause gut microbiota disruption, injury, and inflammatory damage to the intestinal mucosa. In particular, the Escherichia genera, especially E. coli, increased significantly (p < 0.01) at five days post infection (dpi), while Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and other probiotic organisms were significantly reduced (p < 0, 01). Simultaneously, mRNA expression of the tight junction proteins (ZO-1, claudin-3, and occludin), TFF2, and Muc2 were significantly reduced (p < 0.01), indicating destruction of epithelial cell tight junctions. intestines and damage to the mucin layer. construction. In addition, mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-22, IFN-alpha, and IL-17A in intestinal epithelial cells was significantly upregulated, leading to an inflammatory response and intestinal injury.

Detection by PCR, sequencing, phylogenetic analysis and virus isolation. 81 samples (positive rate of samples, 81/187, 43.3%) distributed in 33 chicken flocks (positive rate of chicken flocks, 33/38, 86.8%) were detected as positive for avian adenovirus (FAdV) by PCR method, of which 30 were determined as FAdV C species, 41 were D species, 9 were E species and 1 was uncertain for the viral species by phylogenetic analysis, which implies that at least three species (C, D and E) of FAdV were prevalent in China and species C and D were predominantly the predominant viral strains. Interestingly, our results indicated that two FAdV types (C and D) coexisted in one flock, resulting in a complex condition for disease prevalence. In addition, 13 viral strains of FAdV-C were isolated from different geographical areas and one of the strains isolated from Henan province, named strain HN/151025, was inoculated into 40-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens intramuscularly or intramuscularly. orally to assess pathogenicity. It was found that 90% (9/10) of the chickens died in the intramuscular injection group and 30% (3/10) of the birds died in the oral infection group after challenge.

Cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be important modulators of the intricate virus-host interactions. In order to elucidate the role of miRNAs in madin-darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells during CPIV3 infection. In this study, we performed high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze small RNA libraries in CPIV3-infected and mock-infected MDBK cells. The results showed that a total of 249 known and 152 novel candidate miRNAs were differentially expressed in MDBK cells after CPIV3 infection, and 22,981 and 22,572 target genes were predicted, respectively. Furthermore, RT-qPCR assay was used to further confirm the expression patterns of 13 of these differentially expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets. Functional annotation analysis showed that these up- and down-regulated target genes were mainly involved in MAPK signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, p53, focal adhesion, NF-kappa B signaling pathway and apoptosis, et.

However, the causative pathogen is unknown. We obtained two independent virus isolates named FS and JM from diseased laying duck flocks and identified them as Tembusu virus of duck origin by PCR detection, sequencing full-length open reading frames (ORFs). The two isolates FS and JM shared high sequence similarity with Tembusu virus isolates of duck origin that first emerged in eastern China in April 2010. Blast analysis shows that the full ORF sequences of FS and JM have highest similarity ([99%) to BYD-1 (the first reported Tembusu virus of duck origin) and JS804 (the first reported Tembusu virus of goose origin), indicating that the entire genomes were highly conserved in Tembusu viruses from origin of waterfowl.

Using viral metagenomics, we identified circovirus-like DNA sequences and characterized 15 circular viral DNA genomes in stool samples from humans in Pakistan, Nigeria, Tunisia, and the United States and from wild chimpanzees. Distinct genomic features and phylogenetic analysis indicate that some viral genomes were part of a previously unrecognized genus in the Circoviridae family that we tentatively call ""Cyclovirus"", whose genetic diversity is comparable to that of all known species of the Circovirus genus. Detection of Circoviridae in the feces of US adults was limited to porcine circoviruses, which were also found in most US pork products. To determine whether divergent cycloviruses found in non-US human feces were dietary in origin, we compared them genetically with cycloviruses in muscle tissue samples from farm animals commonly eaten in Pakistan and Nigeria. Limited genetic overlap between cycloviruses in human stool samples and local beef, goat, sheep, camel, and chicken samples indicated that most of the 25 identified cyclovirus species could be human viruses. We show that the genetic diversity of small circular DNA viral genomes in various mammals, including humans, is significantly greater than previously recognized, and frequent exposure through meat consumption and contact with animal or human feces provides ample opportunities. for the transmission of cycloviruses.

Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene sequences of the 27 isolates along with the 29 strains published in Genbank revealed that all IBV strains except one isolate and one published grouped into six distinct genotypes I-VI. 26 isolated strains belong to genotypes I, II, and III, forming a large phylogenetic branch without new predominant strains, while the five vaccine strains belong to genotype V, which is evolutionarily distant from genotypes I, II, and III. The study of the protease cleavage motif within the S1 protein found 12 different cleavage motifs, of which 3 motifs are shared by both isolated and published strains, 2 motifs unique to isolates, and 7 motifs unique to published strains, which which further reinforces the notion of no new predominant strains. Alignment analysis of the amino acid sequences of S1 indicated that the amino acid substitutions, insertions and deletions are polymorphic and diverse, showing no signs of predominant genetic changes among the isolates. Overall, there was no new predominant strain circulating in southern China during 2004-2008. However, circulating IBV strains have continually evolved with distant genetic compositions from vaccine strains; this explains why there have been constant but infrequent outbreaks in commercial flocks in southern China during 2004-2008. Furthermore, to guard against the sudden appearance of new predominant strains, continuous surveillance of IBV strains circulating in the field is extremely important. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.",,"Li, L.;Xue, C.;Chen, F.;Qin, J.;Xie, Q.;Bi, Y.;Cao, Y.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.11.022,0

1148,A new bocavirus in canine liver,"Background: Bocaviruses are classified as a genus within the Parvoviridae family of single-stranded DNA viruses and are pathogenic in some mammalian species. Two species have been previously reported in dogs, the canine minute virus (CVM), associated with neonatal diseases and fertility disorders; and canine bocavirus (CBoV), associated with respiratory disease. Findings: In this study, using deep sequencing of enriched viral particles from the liver of a dog with severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, necrotizing vasculitis, granulomatous lymphadenitis, and anuric renal failure, we identified and characterized a new bocavirus that we named Canine bocavirus 3 (CnBoV3). The three major ORFs of CnBoV3 (NS1, NP1, and VP1) shared less than 60% aa identity with those of other bocaviruses, qualifying it as a new species by ICTV criteria. Inverse PCR showed the presence of concatemerized or circular forms of the genome in liver. Conclusions: We genetically characterized a bocavirus in dog liver that is very distinct from previous canine bocaviruses found in respiratory and fecal samples. Its role in the complex disease of this animal remains to be determined.",,"Li, L. L.;Pesavento, P. A.;Leutenegger, C. M.;Estrada, M.;Coffey, L. L.;Naccache, S. N.;Samayoa, E.;Chiu, C.;Qiu, J.

1149,Viruses in dogs with diarrhea include new kobuviruses and sapoviruses,"Dogs' close interactions with humans and surrounding wildlife provide frequent opportunities for cross-species transmission of viruses. In order to initiate an unbiased characterization of eukaryotic viruses in the gut of dogs, this study used deep sequencing of partially purified viral capsid-protected nucleic acids from the feces of 18 dogs with diarrhea. Known canine parvoviruses, coronaviruses, and rotaviruses were identified, and the genomes of the first reported canine kobuviruses and sapoviruses were characterized. Canine kobuvirus, the first sequenced canine picornavirus and the closest genetic relative of the diarrheal-causing human Aichi virus, was detected with high frequency in the feces of healthy and diarrheic dogs. Canine sapovirus constituted a new genogroup within the Sapovirus genus, a group of viruses also associated with human and animal diarrhea. These results highlight the high frequency of novel virus detection possible even in widely studied animal species using metagenomic approaches, and provide viral genomes for future disease association studies.",,"Li, L.

1151,"Genetic characterization of continuously evolving highly pathogenic H5N6 influenza viruses in China, 2012-2016","H5N6 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and zoonotic disease causing recurrent endemicity in East Asia. At least 155 H5N6 outbreaks, including 15 human infections, have been reported in China. These repeated outbreaks have raised concerns that the H5N6 virus could spread to humans and cause a pandemic. In February 2016, peacocks at a breeding farm exhibited a highly contagious disease. Post-mortem examinations, including RT-PCR and virus isolation, confirmed that highly pathogenic influenza virus H5N6 was the causative agent, and the strain was named A/Pavo Cristatus/Jiangxi/JA1/2016. In animal experiments, it showed high pathogenicity in chickens and an estimated median lethal dose in mice of ~104.3 TCID50. A phylogenetic analysis showed that JA1/2016 was clustered in clade 2.3.4.4 of H5. The FG594-like H5N6 virus from Guangdong province was the likely predecessor of JA1/2016, and the estimated divergence time was June 2014. In addition, we found that H5N6 influenza viruses can be classified into the following two groups: Group 1 and Group 2. Group 2 influenza viruses have not been detected since the end of 2014, while group 1 influenza viruses have continuously evolved and reassorted with the ""genetic background"" circulating in southern China, which has resulted in the increase of new subtypes of this influenza virus. An increase in the number of its identified hosts, the expansion of its distribution range, and the continuing evolution of H5N6 AIVs increase the risk that an H5N6 virus will spread to other continents and cause a pandemic.",,"Li, M.;Zhao, N.;Luo, J.;Li, Y.;Chen, L.;Ma, J.;Zhao, L.;Yuan, G.;Wang, C.;Wang, Y.;Liu, Y.;He, H.",2017.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00260,0
1152,Isolation and characterization of a new virus related to goose parvovirus reveals the evolution of waterfowl parvovirus,"Short beak and dwarfism syndrome (SBDS) has been steadily breaking out in China since 2015. It is caused by a new virus related to goose parvovirus (NGPV) and can severely restrict the growth of ducks. In this study, seven NGPV stains were isolated from different regions of China between 2015 and 2016. To better understand the correlation between NGPV and goose parvovirus (GPV), we performed whole genome sequencing and comprehensive analysis of the NGPV genome. . Phylogenetic and alignment analysis showed that NGPV is a branch of GPV, sharing 92.2% to 97.1% nucleotide identity with GPV. Compared to classical GPV, five consensus nucleotide mutations were found in all seven NGPV isolates and two deletions of 14 nucleotide pairs in six NGPV isolates in the terminal inverted repeats, twelve and eight synchronous amino acid changes were found in the replication protein and capsid protein of NGPV, respectively, which could be important for viral gene regulation, humoral immune responses, and host transfer. In particular, SDLY1602 was shown to be a recombinant strain, with the potential major GPV vaccine strain 82-0321v and the minor GPV wild-type strain GDaGPV. This is the first report showing that recombination between two classical GPV strains generated a naturally circulating NGPV strain.

1153,A set of UV-inducible autolytic vectors for high-throughput screening,"high-throughput screening scheme is often a prerequisite for directed enzyme evolution or metagenomic analysis of DNA samples. To assay intracellular enzymes of interest (eg, when using Escherichia coli), chemical or enzymatic cell lysis is often required, which can be tedious and expensive. In this study, a set of UV-inducible autolytic vectors was constructed to offer a simpler means of cell lysis that does not require additional liquid handling. The bacteriophage Lambda SRRz lysis gene cassette was cloned downstream of a UV-inducible promoter, the recA promoter or the umuDC promoter, and further inserted into the backbone of pUC18 and transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. SRRz expression and cell lysis were induced by UV irradiation. For both the recA and umuDC promoters, at 30 °C the lysis efficiency was found to be constant and greater than 60%, as measured using β-galactosidase as indicator. However, at 37 °C the lysis profiles were found to be erratic. UV lysis in 96-well plates also produced consistent lysis results that were comparable to those obtained by lysozyme treatment, demonstrating the utility of these autolytic vectors in high-throughput screening. This set of artificial SRRz autolysis units should be transferable to other vectors. Surprisingly, E. coli BL21(DE3) was also found to be partially disrupted under UV irradiation, with a lysis efficiency of 44.5% at 30°C and 22.5% at 37°C. © 2006 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Li, S.;Xu, L.;Hua, H.;Ren, C.;Lin, Z.",2007.0,,10.1016/j.jbiotec.2006.07.030,0
1154,Examining terms of the virus genome using high-throughput sequencing,"The analysis of the genomic terminal sequences has been an important step in the studies on the mechanisms of viral DNA replication and packaging. However, traditional methods to study the ends of the genome are challenging due to time-consuming protocols and their inefficiency where critical details are easily lost. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it a powerful tool for studying genome terms. In this study, using NGS, we sequenced one iridovirus genome and twenty phage genomes and confirmed for the first time that the high-frequency sequences (HFS) found in the NGS reads are, in fact, the terminal sequences of the genomes. viral. In addition, we established a criterion to distinguish the type of term and the mode of viral packaging. We also got additional terminal details such as terminal repeats, multiple terminals, asymmetric terminals. With this approach, we were able to simultaneously detect the details of the genome ends and obtain the complete sequence of the bacteriophage genomes. In theory, this application can be further extended to analyze larger and more complicated genomes of plant and animal viruses. This study proposed a novel and efficient method for the investigation of viral replication, packaging, terminala activity, transcriptional regulation, and host cell metabolism.",,"Li, S.

NTR. Comparison of the genome of the SWH/CA/2004 isolate (GenBank access: DQ127910) with other known CSFV isolates was performed and analyzed. Corresponding segments from SWH/CA/2004 and other reported strains shared 80.4-99.8% identity at the nucleotide level and 89.5-99.8% identity at the amino acid level. From an evolutionary point of view, the isolate SWH/CA/2004 is closely related to the highly virulent isolate cF114/CA/2001, with a pairwise distance of 0.013; and distantly related to the moderately virulent isolate GXWZ02/CA/2003, with a pairwise distance of 0.170. Phylogenetic trees of the full-length genome and the following E rns, E1, E2 region and NS5B-based neighbor joining (NJ) method were constructed and roughly divided into different genetic groups according to avirulence, moderate virulence, and high virulence. while other region-based NJ trees demonstrated sequence conservation between these groups. The four genomic regions may constitute important criteria for genetic typing of various CSFV isolates. Based on these analyses, isolate SWH/CA/2004 was deduced to belong to the group of highly virulent isolates. However, SWH/CA/2004 also contains a 14-U deletion in 3â€²-NTR that is characteristic of avirulent isolates.

1156,Differential expression of micrornas in porcine cell lines infected with porcine parvovirus,"Background: Porcine parvovirus (PPV), a member of the Parvoviridae family, causes great economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-protein-coding genes that play many diverse and complex roles in viral infections. Finding: In order to determine the impact of PPV infections on cellular miRNA, we used high-throughput sequencing to sequence two miRNA libraries prepared from porcine kidney 15 (PK-15) cells under normal conditions and during PPV infection. There was differential miRNA expression between infected and uninfected cells: 65 miRNAs were upregulated and 128 miRNAs were downregulated. We detected the expression of miR-10b, miR-20a, miR-19b, miR-181a, miR-146b, miR-18a, and other previously identified immune-related miRNAs. Gene ontology analysis and KEGG function annotations of host target genes suggested that miRNAs are involved in complex cellular pathways, including cellular metabolic processes, immune system processes, and gene expression. Conclusions: These data suggest that a large pool of miRNAs is expressed in PK-15 cells and that some miRNAs were altered in PPV-infected PK-15 cells. Several microRNAs play an important role in the regulation of gene expression related to the immune system.

To understand their genomic characteristics, the complete genomes of isolates S1 and SY0608 were sequenced and analyzed. . The results indicated that their genome composition differed significantly, sharing only 88.5% nucleotide identity with each other. Genetic variation and amino acid substitutions were not randomly distributed in the genome and were primarily focused on ORF1a, ORF3, and ORF5. Strain SY0608, with high pathogenicity, had a deletion of 30 amino acids at amino acid positions 480 and 532-560 compared to strain S1. Amino acid sequence alignment of Nsp1-Nsp8, GP2-GP5, M and N of S1 and SY0608 with other PRRSV isolates showed that the variation was found mainly in the Nsp2, GP3 and GP5 proteins. Compared with strain S1, strain SY0608 showed some potential mutations in the glycosylation site in GP5 at amino acid positions between 26 and 39, which could be associated with viral antigenicity. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the two strains belonged to two different branches indicating no differences in pathogenicity.

1158,From discovery to spread: the evolution and phylogeny of the Getah virus,"Getah virus (GETV) was first isolated in Malaysia in 1955. Since then, epidemics in horses and pigs caused by GETV have caused huge economic losses. Today, GETV has spread throughout Eurasia and Southeast Asia, including mainland China, Korea, Japan, Mongolia, and Russia. The data show that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of GETV existed about 145 years ago (95% HPD: 75-244) and gradually evolved into four distinct evolutionary populations: Groups I-IV. The MRCA of GETV in Group III, which includes all GETV isolated from mosquitoes, pigs, horses, and other animals since the 1960s (from latitude 19°N to 60°N), existed approximately 51 years ago (95% HPD: 51°). “72). Group III is responsible for the majority of viral epidemics among domestic animals. An analysis of the sequence and structure of the GETV E2 protein revealed seven common amino acid mutation sites. These sites are responsible for the structural and electrostatic differences detected between the widespread Group III isolates and the prototype strain MM2021. These differences may explain the recent geographic radiation of the virus.

In total, 252 genes and 167 miRNAs were differentially expressed in ALV-J-infected spleens compared to control uninfected spleens. miR-23b expression was upregulated in ALV-J-infected spleens compared with control spleens, and transcriptome analysis revealed that interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) expression was downregulated in spleens infected with ALV-J compared to uninfected ones. spleens A dual luciferase reporter assay showed that IRF1 was a direct target of miR-23b. Overexpression of miR-23b significantly (P = 0.0022) decreased IRF1 mRNA levels and repressed IRF1-3'-UTR reporter activity. In vitro experiments revealed that miR-23b overexpression enhanced ALV-J replication, while miR-23b loss-of-function inhibited ALV-J replication. IRF1 overexpression inhibited ALV-J replication, and IRF1 knockdown enhanced ALV-J replication. Furthermore, IRF1 overexpression significantly (P = 0.0014) increased IFN-β expression.

Coronavirus-like particles were observed in suspensions of homogenized brain tissue from dead piglets by electron microscopy, and a wild-type strain of PHEV was isolated, characterized, and designated as PHEV-CC14. Histopathological examinations of the dead piglets showed features of nonsuppurative encephalitis, with some neurons in the cerebral cortex degenerated and necrotic, and neuronophagia. Similarly, mice inoculated with PHEV-CC14 were found to have central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, with symptoms of depression, arched waists, standing foreclaws, and webbed paws. Furthermore, PHEV-positive labeling of neurons in the cortices of dead piglets and infected mice supported viral infections of the nervous system. Then, the major structural genes of PHEV-CC14 were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed, and the strain shared 95% to 99.2% nt identity with the other PHEV strains available in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis clearly showed that the wild type strain was grouped in a subclass with a HEV-JT06 strain. These findings suggested that the virus had a strong CNS tropism, thus inducing non-suppurative encephalitis as a cause of death in piglets. At the same time, the predicted risk of widespread transmission showed some variation among the PHEV strains currently circulating around the world. Above all, the information presented in this study can not only provide a good reference for the experimental diagnosis of PHEV infection in pig farming, but also promote the development of new effective vaccines.",,"Li, Z.;He, W.;Lan, Y.;Zhao, K.;Lv, X.;Lu, H.;Ding, N.;Zhang, J.;Shi, J.;Shan, C.;Gao, F.",2016.0,,,0

1169,Phylogenetic characterization of Newcastle disease viruses isolated in Taiwan during 2003-2006,"Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates were obtained from chicken cases from various locations in Taiwan during 2003-2006 and analyzed genotypically using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with specific primers for the viral fusion protein gene (F). (534 bp). Part of the amplified F protein DNA product (nucleotide sequence 47–418) and deduced amino acid sequences were compared phylogenetically with those of previously reported strains from Taiwan and other geographic regions. Our results showed that all Taiwanese isolates (n = 20) collected during 2003-2006, according to the phylogenetic tree, belong to the VIId genotype. Furthermore, the six Taiwanese isolates obtained in 2003 carry the 112R-RQK-R116 motif and have the amino acid L23 replaced by F23 (assigned as Group 1). On the other hand, 12 of the 14 Taiwanese isolates obtained during 2004-2006 possess the 112R-RKK-R116 motif and have the amino acid G74, instead of E74 (assigned as Group 2). To our knowledge, this is the first VIId isolate reported to possess the G74/112R-RKK-R116 sequences within the F0 protein. Given that high mortality, severe clinical signs, typical postmortem lesions, and a high intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) were observed in NDV-infected chickens, these isolates acquired between 2003 and 2006 are considered velogenic. Group 2 viruses have become dominant and responsible for most outbreaks in Taiwan in recent years. Based on our phylogenetic analysis, it can be postulated that these isolates evolved from previously reported local strains, with the Group 2 family emerging as the latest in genotype VIId.

1170,Live attenuated nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus vaccine provides broad cross-protection against new variant strains,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infections cause major economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide, and the emergence of new variant strains complicates disease control. The present study investigated the genetic and protectotypic characteristics of newly emerged Korean IBV strains. A phylogenetic analysis showed that several recent isolates formed 2 different groups (new groups 1 and 2), which were distinct from other pre-existing groups. The new group 1 IBV strains represented recombinants between the Korean nephropathogenic strain KM91 and the QXIBV strain. The new group 2 IBV strains showed low amino acid homology (<58.7%) compared to previous isolates. We evaluated the protective efficacy of commercial IBV vaccines (strain H120 and K2) against these new isolates. In cross-protection studies, strain H120 did not provide sufficient protection against these variants. However, the highly attenuated nephropathogenic IBV vaccine, strain K2, provided significantly higher levels of protection against the variants compared to chickens vaccinated with H120 (P < 0.05 or better). These results indicate that the K2 vaccine could be useful in reducing economic losses caused by newly evolved (new group 1) and variant (new group 2) IBV recombinants. © 2012 Poultry Science Association Inc.",,"Lim, T.

After high-throughput sequencing, a total of 7743 contigs assembled de novo were constructed and compared to known nucleotide/amino acid sequences from the GenBank database. BLASTx analyzes revealed that 279 contigs (4%) were related to eukaryotic virus sequences. Viral genomic sequences (full or partial) indicative of members of recognized viral families including Adenoviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae and Reoviridae were identified, some of which represent new genotypes. In addition, a variety of DNA viruses that encode proteins associated with circular replication were also identified. The characterization of the fecal virome of healthy chickens described here not only provides a description of the viruses found in said niche, but should also represent a baseline for future studies comparing viral populations in healthy and diseased chicken flocks.

Here, to examine possible associations between enteric viruses and MAS, fecal viromes from 70 fecal samples collected from diseased (n = 35) and healthy (n = 35) chickens from seven flocks were characterized and compared. After high-throughput sequencing, a total of 8,347,319 paired end reads were generated, averaging 231 nt. Through analysis of de novo assembled contigs, 144 contigs >1000 nt with hits in eukaryotic viral sequences were identified, as determined by the GenBank database. Several known and unknown representatives of Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae were identified, as well as new uncharacterized CRESS-DNA viruses. However, the distribution of viral genome sequence reads identified in healthy or diseased birds did not reveal statistically significant differences.

1175,High prevalence of hepatitis E virus in Swedish moose: phylogenetic characterization and comparison of viruses from different regions.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infects a variety of species, including humans, pigs, wild boar, and deer. Zoonotic transmission may contribute to the high seroprevalence of HEV in the human population in many countries. A new divergent HEV from moose (Alces alces) was recently identified by partial genome sequencing in Sweden. Since only one strain was found, its classification within the HEV family, prevalence in elk, and zoonotic potential were unclear. Therefore, we screened samples from 231 moose in seven Swedish counties for HEV, and sequenced an almost complete moose HEV genome. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to classify this virus within the family Hepeviridae and to explore potential host-specific determinants. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The prevalence of HEV in moose was determined by PCR (marker of active infection) and serological assays (marker of past infection) of sera and 51 fecal samples from 231 Swedish moose. Markers of active and past infection were found in 67 (29%) animals, while 34 (15%) were positive for HEV RNA, 43 (19%) were seropositive for anti-HEV antibodies, and 10 (4%) had both. markers. . The number of young people positive for HEV RNA was higher than that of older people, and the number of people positive for anti-HEV antibodies increased with age. The high-throughput sequenced moose HEV genome was 35-60% identical to existing HEVs. Partial ORF1 sequences from 13 elk strains showed high similarity among them, forming a distinct monophyletic clade with a common ancestor of the HEV genotypes 1-6 group, which includes members known for zoonotic transmission. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a high frequency of HEV in moose in Sweden, with markers of current and past infection demonstrated in 30% of the animals. The elk is therefore an important animal reservoir of HEV. The phylogenetic relationship showed that the elk HEV belonged to the genotype group 1-6, which includes strains that also infect humans and, therefore, may signify a potential for zoonotic transmission of this HEV.",,"Lin, J.;Karlsson, M.;Olofson, A.

To assess the status of ALV-J infection in broiler chickens in southern China, the molecular epidemiology of ALV-J strains was investigated. In this study, the presence of ALV-J was investigated in a total of 265 clinical samples collected from southern China between 2013 and 2014, resulting in 12 virus isolates. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 91.7% (11/12) of the ALV-J isolates possessed high homology to Chinese layer isolates and belonged to a subgroup. One of the ALV isolates (designated GD1411-1) was relatively closely related to ALV-J broiler isolates, indicating that the GD1411-1 isolate might be a transition strain.

The main causative agents of HFMD are enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). Recently, coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) infections have been reported in neighboring countries. Infected infants and children may develop fever, mouth/throat ulcers, rashes, and blisters on the hands and feet. Furthermore, EV71 infections can cause fatal neurological complications. Since 1997, EV71 has caused deaths in Sarawak and Peninsular Malaysia. The purpose of this study was to identify and classify viruses that were detected in patients presenting with clinical signs and symptoms of HFMD in Seri Kembangan, Malaysia. From December 2012 to July 2013, a total of 28 patient samples with clinical case definitions of HFMD were collected. HFMD viruses were detected by semi-nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (snRT-PCR).

1182,"Hypotheses about the source, transmission and characteristics of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus infection, based on analysis of epidemiological field research and gene sequence analysis","Abstract: On March 31, 2013, the National Health and Family Planning Commission announced that human infections with influenza A (H7N9) virus had occurred in Shanghai and Anhui provinces, China. H7N9 cases were subsequently detected in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The virus was estimated to have first spread north along the route taken by migratory birds and then spread to neighboring provinces with the sale of birds. Epidemiological studies were conducted on samples from the external environment of infected cases, routes of transmission, farmers' markets, and live bird markets. Phylogenetic study of viral sequences from human and avian infections in Zhejiang showed that those from Shanghai and Jiangsu provinces along Taihu Lake were highly homologous with those from the external environment. This suggests that avian viruses carried by waterfowl combined with virus carried by migratory birds, giving rise to avian influenza virus H7N9, which is highly pathogenic for humans. The virus may have been transmitted from local wild birds to domestic poultry and then to humans, or spread further through trade in wholesale poultry markets. As the weather has turned warmer and with measures taken to end the poultry trade and facilitate health communication, the epidemic in the first half of the year has been kept under control. However, the source of infection in the triangular area around Taihu Lake still remains. The H7N9 epidemic will likely hit the area later this year and next spring when migratory birds return, and may even spread to other areas. Therefore, great importance should be attached to the wild birds of Lake Taihu as depositaries and spreaders of the virus: research and study of this population is essential.",,"Ling, F.;Chen, E.;Liu, Q.;Miao, Z.;Gong, Z.",2015.0,,10.1111/zph.12110,0

Morphologically, it more closely resembles pneumoviruses than other members of the paramyxovirus family. In this communication, we report the identification of five virus-induced polypeptides in TRT virus-infected BS-C-1 cells. The Mr of these polypeptides was estimated as 38K, 35K, 30K, 19K and 15K from their electrophoretic mobility on 6-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels. The viral specificity of four (Mr 38K, 35K, 30K and 19K polypeptides) of these five was confirmed by their predominance as in vitro translation products of mRNA from TRT virus-infected BS-C-1 cells. In vitro translation revealed an additional virus-specific polypeptide with an estimated Mr of 22K and may be a non-structural polypeptide or a minor structural protein. All six polypeptides were immunoprecipitated with murine antiserum. Three other polypeptides (129K, 57K and 45K) were also immunoprecipitated. The 57K, 45K, and 15K Mr polypeptides have been glycosylated, and the 57K glycopolypeptide may be a disulfide-linked dimer of the 45K and 15K glycopolypeptides. Another major 83K Mr glycopolypeptide was observed but its viral specificity could not be confirmed. Taken together, our results tentatively identify eight or nine polypeptides specified by TRT virus and are consistent with the classification of TRT virus as a new member of the Pneumovirus genus.",,"Ling, R.;Pringle, C.

The resurgence of Aujeszky's disease (AD) in pig farms vaccinated with live vaccine (Bartha-K61) caused substantial economic losses to the Chinese pig industry since the end of 2011. A field ADV, named Qihe547, was isolated from pigs showing clinical symptoms suspicious for AD. symptom. To better understand the genetic characteristics and mutations of Qihe547 ADV, the entire genome was sequenced and analyzed. Results: The genomic length of Qihe547 ADV was 143,404 bp, with a G+C content of 73.59%. Genome-wide-based phylogenetic analysis of ADV strains revealed that Chinese ADV strains fell into a group with three subgroups. Qihe547 ADV was closely related to these newly isolated ADV strains in China since 2012. Qihe547 exhibited numerous hypervariable regions compared to overseas ADV strains. In 34 genes of Qihe547 ADV, amino acid (AA) insertion or deletion was observed. In addition, numerous AA mutations were found in the main protective antigen genes (gB, gC and gD genes). Potential antigenic peptide differences in major protective antigens between Qihe547 ADV and ADV Bartha were discovered in the dominant antigenic regions of gB (AA59-AA126, AA507-AA734), the extracellular region of gC and gD. Conclusion: A high diversity was observed between Qihe547 and foreign isolates of ADV. AA variations and potential antigenic peptide differences in important functional regions of the major protective antigen (gB, gC, and gD) of ADV Qihe547 may contribute to immune evasion of the virus and may be a partial reason why the virus escapes. of vaccination. of the Bartha-K61 vaccine.

Here, we characterized these viruses by performing sequencing and phylogenetic analyzes of their viral genes, evaluating their virulence in ducks and mice, and performing cross-protection experiments in chickens. Sequence analysis revealed that the HA genes of these H5N5 viruses showed 97.1-97.8% homology to influenza A/wild duck/Hunan/211/2005 (H5N1) virus and that their NA genes showed 96.4-96.8% nucleotide identity with the NA gene of A/duck/Hunan/5613/2003 (H6N5) influenza virus, which belongs to the Eurasian lineage. Genotypic analysis indicated that these H5N5 viruses were multiple reassortments among H5N1, H5N2, H6N2, and H6N5 viruses. Analysis of the HA clade showed that these H5N5 viruses cluster in the 2.3.4 clade. In animal experiments, these H5N5 viruses caused 50% mortality in ducks and 100% mortality in chickens. In cross-protection experiments, the clade 2.3.2 avian influenza vaccine might provide only 75% protection in chickens against H5N5 challenge. Furthermore, the H5N5 virus replicated efficiently in the lungs of mice, suggesting that H5N5 viruses have the potential to infect mammalian hosts. Since ducks have served as reassignment vessels, playing a critical role in the generation of new influenza virus subtypes, it is important to monitor the emergence of this new influenza virus subtype in waterfowl to understand its ecology and evolution and control the spread of new viruses © 2013 Elsevier BV",,"Liu, C.

1191,Development of a reverse genetics system for small ruminant morbilliviruses: rescue of recombinant viruses to express the Echinococcus granulosus EG95 antigen,"Peste des petits ruminants and cystic hydatid disease may be simultaneously endemic in a given area. Its pathogens are small ruminant morbillivirus (SRMV) and Echinococcus granulosus (E. granulosus), respectively. SRMV, formerly called peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), is classified in the genus Morbillivirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. This virus is an ideal vaccine vector for delivering immunogenic proteins. In this study, a reverse genetics system was developed to rescue a recombinant SRMV (strain Nigeria 75/1) expressing the EG95 antigen from E. granulosus in vitro. Recombinant SRMV, although replicating more slowly than its parent virus, could efficiently express EG95 antigen on cells by Western blot, indirect immunofluorescence, and mass spectrometry analyses. An EG95 subunit vaccine has been widely used for the prevention of cystic hydatid disease in some areas of China. If EG95-expressing SRMV is shown to induce effective immune responses against both diseases in a future animal experiment, it would become a potential candidate for a bivalent vaccine.",,"Liu, F.;Li, L.;Liu, Y.;Sun, C.;Liu, C.;Wu, X.;Wang, Z.",2019.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2018.12.008,0
1192,Rescue of eGFP-expressing small ruminant morbilliviruses to identify the susceptibility of eight mammalian cell lines to their infection,"Small ruminant morbillivirus (SRMV), formerly called peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), is classified in the genus Morbillivirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. If genetically modified using reverse genetics, SRMV would be a useful vector for expressing foreign proteins in vitro and in vivo. In this study, a recombinant SRMV was rescued by reverse genetics to efficiently express an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) in vitro. Based on the green fluorescence-tracked characteristics of recombinant SRMV, eight mammalian cell lines (BHK-21, F81, MDBK, RK13, MDCK, PK15, Vero, and GT) were screened for their susceptibilities to SRMV infection. The result showed that all cell lines could be infected with the recombinant SRMV but with different efficiencies. Vero and PK15 cell lines showed the highest and lowest susceptibilities to their infection, respectively, simply by comparing the proportions of green fluorescing cells among eight cell monolayers.",,"Liu, F.;Zhang, Y.;Li, L.;Zuo, Y.;Sun, C.;Xiaodong, W.;Wang, Z.",2019.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2018.12.011,0
1193,Identification and analysis of novel viral and dysregulated host microRNAs in PK15 cells infected with variant pseudorabies virus,"Pseudorabies (PR) is one of the most devastating diseases in the pig industry. To identify changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression and post-transcriptional regulatory responses to PRV infection in porcine kidney epithelial cells (PK15), we sequenced a small library of RNAs (RNAs) prepared from infected PK15 cells and the we compared with a library prepared from uninfected cells. Cells by Illumina deep sequencing. Here we found 25 new viral miRNAs by high-throughput sequencing and 20 of these miRNAs were confirmed by stem-loop RT-qPCR. Interestingly, unlike the usual miRNAs encoded by α-herpesviruses, which are found clustered in the long latency transcript (LLT), these new viral miRNAs are found throughout the PRV genome like β-herpesviruses. Viral miRNAs are predicted to target multiple genes and form a complex regulatory network. GO analysis on viral miRNA host targets was involved in complex cellular processes, including metabolic pathway, biological regulation, stimulus response, signaling process, and immune response. Furthermore, 13 host miRNAs were expressed with a significant difference after PRV infection: 8 miRNAs were upregulated and 5 miRNAs were downregulated, which may affect viral replication in the host cell. Our results provided new insights into the characteristics of miRNAs in response to PRV infection, which is important for further study of the function of these miRNAs.",,"Liu, F.;Zheng, H.;Tong, W.;Li, G.

1194,Genetic diversity of VP1 gene of duck hepatitis virus type I (DHV-I) isolates from southeastern China is related to attenuation of isolates,"The complete sequence of an isolate (ZJ-V) of duck hepatitis virus I (DHV-I), originally taken from the field in southeastern China, was determined. It was 7691 nucleotides long and had 5- and 3-terminal noncoding regions of 626 and 315 nucleotides, respectively. The poly(A) tail contained at least 22 residues and the single open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 2249 amino acids. The VP1 gene was also sequenced from nine field isolates from southeastern China and three attenuated DHV-I vaccine strains. In phylogenetic analysis of isolates and other published sequences, attenuated and tissue-adapted isolates (including ZJ-V) clustered as significantly different genotypes from field isolates that had not been passaged in chicken/duck embryos . There were two consistent amino acid substitutions (E129 â†' V129 and A142 â†' S142) among all field and all tissue-adapted isolates. The carboxyl terminal region was generally the most variable and here the four attenuated Chinese isolates showed six differences consistent with the field isolates (S181 â†' L181, H183K184 â†' R183G1841, N193 â†' D193, E205 â†' K205, R217 â†' K217, N235 â†' D235).

A large open reading frame (ORF) was found within the genome (nt 627 to 7373) encoding a polypeptide of 2249 amino acids. Our data also showed that the poly(A) tail of DHV-1 has at least 22 A. Sequence comparison revealed significant homology (91.9% to 95.7%) between the protein sequences of isolate ZJ- V and those of 21 reference isolates. Although DHV-1 has been classified as an unassigned virus in the family Picornaviridae, its genome showed some unique features. DHV-1 contains 3 copies of the 2A gene and only 1 copy of the 3B gene, and its 3â€²-NCR is longer than that of other picornaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis for sequence homology based on VP1 protein sequences showed that the ZJ-V isolate shares high sequence homology with reported DHV-1 isolates (92.9% to 99.2% ), indicating that DHV-1 is genetically stable.",,"Liu, G.

In this study, a strain of EMCV, named JZ1202, was isolated from semi-captive wild boars with acute myocarditis and sudden death in central China. It was identified by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and genome sequencing. Subsequent results showed that the virus could produce a specific cytopathic effect on BHK cells and could cause clinical symptoms and pathological changes in mice. Whole genome sequencing and multiple sequence alignment indicated that strain JZ1202 was 81.3%-99.9% identical to other isolates worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome, ORF, VP3/VP1 and 3D genes using the neighbor joining method revealed that isolate JZ1202 clustered in lineage 1.

Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome, open reading frame (ORF), capsid coding region (CCR), and VP3/VP1 sequences by neighbor joining analysis revealed that these isolates belonged to lineage 1. Nucleotide sequences from six isolates showed greater than 99% pairwise identity rates, and sequences from pig and wild boar isolates in the same region were completely identical to each other, without any genetic deletions or insertions. From the comparative analysis of the variability of each EMCV protein coding region, the 3D and VP3 regions showed the highest average identity rates and were confirmed to be highly conserved. In contrast, protein coding regions 3A and 3B were confirmed to be highly variable regions with the lowest average identity rate. Our data confirmed that EMCV strains isolated from pigs and rats had high homology to each other, implying that rats may play an important role in the transmission of EMCV between domestic pigs and wild boars.",,"Liu, H.;Li, Y.;Zhang, G.;Sang, S.;Wang, C.;Chang, H.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2017.09.032,0

1200,Characterization of Newcastle disease virus isolated from waterfowl in China,"Ten representative Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates obtained from outbreaks in waterfowl (geese and ducks) in China since 1997 were characterized pathotypically and genotypically. Median time to death and intracerebral pathogenicity index were used to assess the virulence of isolates. Pathogenicity tests showed that all 10 isolates were velogenic strains. The main functional region of the F gene composed of 535 nucleotides was amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site in all 10 isolates was 112RRQKRF117, which is a typical sequence of velogenic strains and is in agreement with the results of in vivo pathogenicity tests. For genotyping, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on nucleotides 47-435 of the F gene. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the isolates were of genotype VII virus. Only one strain, WG, was found to be of genotype IX virus. This strain was closest to F48E9, which was isolated in China in 1946 and has been used as the standard challenge strain in vaccine evaluation in China. So the genotype IX virus still causes sporadic infections in geese in China. Subsequent phylogenetic analyzes on genotype VII strains found that all of these strains can be subdivided into 5 subgenotypes, with the majority of isolates (8 strains) classified as VIId, a predominant genotype responsible for most outbreaks of Alzheimer's disease. Newcastle (ND) since the end of the last century in China. Only 1 strain, NDV03-053, was shown to be of genotype VIIc virus.

DNA fragments of 1022 and 1152 base pairs were amplified among ARV isolates, respectively, indicating that there were no apparent deletions or insertions in these regions. Amplified fragments from vaccine strains and field isolates were digested with five different restriction enzymes Bcn I, Hae III, Taq I, Dde I and Hinc II, respectively. Restriction fragment profiles observed on polyacrylamide gels showed heterogeneity between the vaccine and Taiwanese isolates. All ARV isolates tested showed different restriction enzyme cleavage patterns and could be clearly distinguished. Strain typing based on cleavage sites in the ARV gene encoding sigmaC showed that the viruses could be classified into four distinct groups. A phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequences of the gene encoding sigmaC revealed that Taiwanese ARV isolates were classified into four distinct groups, indicating that the genotyping is consistent with typing based on DNA fragment length polymorphism. restriction enzyme of the gene encoding ARV sigmaC. The results suggested that polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction enzyme analysis provided a simple and rapid approach for the characterization of isolated ARVs.

In the present study, a new PRRSV strain variant named FJLIUY-2017 was isolated from the abortion rate (25%) in pregnant gilts in Fujian province in China in 2017. To further our knowledge about the new PRRSV strain virus, we characterized the complete genome of FJLIUY-2017. Comparison with PRRS sequences in GenBank confirmed the absence of close relatives (<92%), but indicated that FJLIUY-2017 belonged to NADC30-like PRRSV.

METHODS: Two clinical samples were collected from HFMD patients in consultation external. service, and then viral isolation was performed by inoculating RD cells. The VP4-VP2 region of two viral isolates was amplified using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction methods, and the PCR products were then sequenced; Molecular typing was used to identify the serotype of these two viral isolates. Finally, a phylogenetic tree was constructed between these two viral isolates from Gansu and 16 CVA4 strains downloaded from the GenBank database. RESULTS: Two viruses were isolated from clinical samples collected from two HFMD patients by inoculation of RD cells, and identified as CVA4 by using molecular typing methods. The nucleotide sequence homology in the VP4-VP2 region between the two Gansu CVA4 strains was 94.6% and the amino acid sequence homology was 100%. Compared to the prototype strain of CVA4 (Strain High Point/USA/1948), the nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence homologies were 85.5%-85.8% and 99.3%, respectively.

Surveillance studies have shown that viruses of the H9N2 subtype are found worldwide in domestic birds and could infect mammalian species, including humans. Here, we genetically analyzed the HA and NA genes of five H9N2 viruses isolated from migratory ducks on the Hokkaido, Japan, Siberian Flyway during 1997-2000. The results showed that the HA and NA genes of these viruses belong to the same lineages, respectively. Compared to A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97-like and A/duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97 viruses, HA and NA from migratory duck isolates were closely related to those from H9N2 viruses isolated from chicken in Korea, indicating that Korea H9N2 viruses could be derived from migratory ducks. The NA genes of all five isolates were located in the same cluster as those of the N2 viruses, which had caused a human pandemic in 1968, indicating that the NA genes of earlier pandemic strains still circulate in waterfowl reservoirs.

1212,"Phylogeny, classification and evolutionary knowledge of pestiviruses","The genus Pestivirus comprises four established species: bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1) and 2 (BVDV-2), border disease virus (BDV), and classical swine fever virus (CSFV); and a tentative species, Giraffe pestivirus. Additional pestiviruses have been identified and suggested for recognition as new subgroups/species. To achieve a reliable phylogeny as a basis for pestivirus classification, a molecular dataset of 56 pestiviruses and 2089 characters, comprising the 5â€²UTR, full Npro and E2 gene regions, was analyzed using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approach. A robust and identical tree topology was inferred, where seven well-supported monophyletic clades and two highly divergent lineages were identified. The most recent common ancestor dating for the major pestivirus lineages was estimated and their evolutionary histories revealed. Consequently, a new proposal is presented for the classification of pestiviruses into nine species: BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BVDV-3 (atypical bovine pestivirus), Giraffe pestivirus, CSFV, BDV, Tunisian sheep virus (TSV; previously referred to as ""Tunisian isolates""), Antelope, and Bungowannah. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

1213,Characterization of clade 7.2 H5 avian influenza viruses that continue to circulate in chickens in China,"Avian influenza H5N1 viruses emerged in Southeast Asia in the late 20th century and have evolved in multiple phylogenetic clades based on their hemagglutinin (HA)-encoding genes. Clade 7.2 viruses were first detected in chickens in northern China in 2006, and vaccines specifically targeting the clade were developed and have been used in poultry in China since 2006. During routine surveillance and diagnosis of diseases, we isolated seven H5 viruses between 2011 and 2014 that carry the genes of the clade 7.2 HA. Here, we conduct extensive studies to understand how clade 7.2 H5 viruses have evolved in chickens in China. Full genome sequence analysis revealed that the seven viruses formed two subtypes (four H5N1 viruses and three H5N2 viruses) and four genotypes by deriving genes from other influenza viruses. All viruses were antigenically derived from clade 7.2 viruses that were isolated in 2006. Pathogenicity studies of four viruses, one from each genotype, revealed that all viruses are highly pathogenic in chickens, but none of them could replicate in chickens. the Ducks. All four viruses bound exclusively to avian-like receptors and replicated only in the turbinates and/or lungs of mice; none of them were lethal to mice at a dose of 10<sup>6</sup> 50% egg infective doses (EID<sub>50</sub>). Our study indicates that although clade 7.2 viruses have not been eradicated from poultry by vaccination, they have not become more dangerous to other animals (eg, ducks and mice) and humans. SIGNIFICANCE: Animal influenza viruses can acquire the ability to infect and kill humans. H5N1 viruses have been of concern in recent decades due to their clear pandemic potential. We classify H5N1 influenza viruses into different phylogenetic clades based on their HA genes. Clade 7.2 viruses were detected in chickens in several provinces in northern China in 2006. Vaccines for these viruses were later developed and have been used to control infection in poultry ever since. Here, we analyzed the genetic and biological properties of seven clade 7.2 viruses that were isolated from chickens between 2011 and 2014. We found that after nearly 9 years of circulation in chickens, clade 7.2 viruses still bind exclusively to receptors for avian type and are of low pathogenicity for mice, suggesting that these H5 viruses pose a low risk to human public health.",,"Liu, L.;Zeng, X.;Chen, P.;Deng, G.;Li, Y.;Shi, J.;Gu, C.;Kong, H.;Suzuki, Y.;Jiang, Y.;Tian, G.;Chen, H.",2016.0,2001-11-01 00:00:00,,0
1214,Genotypic and pathotypic characterization of Newcastle disease virus isolated from racing pigeons in China,"In this study, a Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolated from an outbreak in racing pigeons in China was characterized. The complete gene of the NDV isolate was sequenced and phylogenetic analysis was performed. The pathogenicity experiment was carried out on pigeons, chickens and ducks. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strain clustered with class II viruses has high phylogenetic similarity with NDV strains isolated from pigeons in China, but was far from the prevalence of viruses in chickens and vaccine strains used in China. The deduced amino acid sequence of the fusion protein (F) cleavage site confirmed that the isolate contained the virulent motif (112)RRQKRF(117) at the cleavage site, but did not cause disease in chickens and ducks. However, the isolate had virulence in pigeons, resulting in severe nervous signs and high mortality. Pigeons were considered as a potential source of NDV infection and disease for commercial poultry flocks. Therefore, new vaccines to prevent NDV infection in pigeon flocks should be developed as soon as possible, and strict biosecurity measures should be taken to reduce the risk of Newcastle disease outbreaks in pigeons.",,"Liu, M.;Qu, Y.;Wang, F.;Liu, S.;Sun, H.",2015.0,,10.3382/ps/pev106,0
1215,High reversal potential of a cell-adapted vaccine candidate against highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome,"Modified live vaccine (MLV) based on highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) is prone to rapid reversal of virulence when circulating in host animals. The aim of this study was to assess the virulence reversal potential of HP-PRRSV MLV and to identify elements within the HP-PRRSV genome that contribute to this phenomenon. A blind passage cell adaptation strategy was attempted to attenuate an HP-PRRSV strain JX143, which was isolated during the atypical PRRS outbreak in 2006. Two attenuated candidates, passage 87 (JXM87) and passage 105 (JXM105), used as MLV, safety and efficacy balance in 4-week-old piglets (unpublished data). Two studies were conducted during which the reversion to virulence of the candidates was evaluated through five subsequent passages in susceptible piglets (21 +/- 3 days of age). The results of both studies clearly showed an increase in clinical signs, pyrexia and lung lesions, as well as a decrease in average daily weight gain from passage 3 in susceptible pigs, and indicated that both candidates regained virulence, regardless of the level of virulence. of pass The increase in the respective parameters was accompanied by an increase in viraemia in the piglets: the JXM87 virus titer increased from Passage 1 (P1) 4.40 Lg TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL at P4 5, 75 Lg TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL, and the JXM105 virus titer increased from P1 3.78 Lg TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL to P4 6.42 Lg TCID<sub>50< /sub>/mL. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on clinical samples (serum, lung tissue) from P4 animals. Sequence analysis comparing the P4 materials with their parental strains revealed 10 amino acid mutations in 4 proteins for JXM87 and 14 amino acid mutations in 9 proteins for JXM105, respectively. Interestingly, five amino acid mutations were identical for the two candidates, which were located in the nsp1beta, GP5a, and nsp10 coding regions, suggesting that nsp1beta, GP5a, and nsp10 might contribute to virulence in HP-PRRSV.",,"Liu, P.;Bai, Y.;Jiang, X.;Zhou, L.;Yuan, S.;Yao, H.;Yang, H.;Sun, Z.",2018.0,Dec,,0
1216,Phylogenetic analysis of 626 human and animal hepatitis E virus (HEV) isolates in China (1986-2011) showing genotype diversity and zoonotic transmission,"Hepatitis E is considered a public health problem in China. To determine the overall molecular epidemiology of hepatitis E virus (HEV) and analyze the situation of interspecies transmission between humans and pigs in China during the past 25 years (1986-2011), 626 complete and partial sequences of HEV were identified. (89 isolates per our group) isolates from humans and animals in China were retrieved from GenBank and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. There were three genotypes and 11 subgenotypes of HEV that were prevalent in China. In addition, rabbit HEVs, whose genotype is controversial, are also widespread in China. Genotype 1 was the most isolated genotype before 2000 and was mainly detected in Xinjiang, Beijing, and eastern China. However, genotype 4, which was identified in most regions of China during the past 10 years, surpassed genotype 1 in isolation frequency throughout the country. HEV genotype 3 strains have only been found in eastern China and are believed to have been imported from Japan. Both genotypes 3 and 4 were found in humans and pigs, and cross-species transmission from pigs to humans of the two genotypes may have occurred in northeast, northwest, north, east, and south China. These results indicate that HEV strains with considerable genetic diversity are widespread and zoonotic transmission between pigs and humans appears ubiquitous in China. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",,"Liu, P.;Li, L.;Wang, L.;Bu, Q.;Fu, H.;Han, J.;Zhu, Y.;Lu, F.;Zhuang, H.",2012.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2012.01.017,0
1217,Characterization of a highly pathogenic clade 2.3.4 H5N1 avian influenza virus isolated from a tree sparrow,"The spread of the H5N1 virus to a wide range of bird and mammal species may facilitate adaptation of the virus to human populations. In the present study, a study of avian influenza virus in tree sparrows was conducted and an HPAI H5N1 virus (A/tree sparrow/Jiangsu/1/08) was isolated. The H5N1 virus was found to be a genotype V variant belonging to clade 2.3.4, which had recently emerged in southern China in 2005. Genetic analysis showed that it was closely related to A/Jiangsu/1/07 (H5N1 ), which was thought to be responsible for likely limited person-to-person transmission in a family group in China in 2007. Pathogenicity studies showed the virus to be highly virulent when experimentally inoculated into chickens, sparrows, and mice. Since clade 2.3.4, the genotype V variant of the H5N1 virus, has been responsible for the majority of fatal human cases in China during 2005-2008, the existence of such H5N1 variants in tree sparrows highlights the threat potential for this type of infection of wild birds. veterinary and public health. © 2009 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Liu, Q.;Ma, J.;Kou, Z.;Pu, J.;Lei, F.;Li, T.;Liu, J.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2009.09.014,0

The SFTS virus (SFTSV) has been identified as the causative agent of the disease and has been recognized as a threat to public health. This new Bunyavirus belongs to the Phlebovirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family. This review also describes the different aspects of virology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical symptoms based on surveillance data from the published article and phylogenetic analyzes of viral sequences of large, medium, and small segments retrieved from the database. data using mega 5.05, simplot 3.5. 1, 4.611 network and epi 3.5.3 information system software. SFTS presents with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and marked changes in several serum biomarkers. The disease has a mortality rate of 10 to 15%, commonly due to multi-organ dysfunction. SFTSV is mainly reported in rural areas of central and northeastern China, with seasonal occurrence from May to September, mainly in people over 50 years of age. A wide range of domestic animals, including sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, dogs, and chickens, have been shown to be seropositive for SFTSV. Ticks, especially Haemaphysalis longicornis, are suspected to be the potential vector, which has a wide range of animal hosts in the world. Further studies are needed to elucidate the vector-animal-human ecological cycle, pathogenic mechanisms in high-level animal models, and vaccine development. © 2013 The authors.

1219,Identification of avian infectious bronchitis coronaviruses with mutations in gene 3,"The sequence of a 6.0 kb fragment in the 3' coding region of the genome in 27 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains was compared. All of these strains have the same gene order S-3-M-5-N, as is the case with other IBVs. However, the sizes of the corresponding open reading frames (ORFs) of some genes varied between virus strains. Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignments demonstrated that recombination events had occurred in the origin and evolution of strains CK/CH/LSD/03I and CK/CH/LLN/98I and that potential recombinant binding sites could be located in genes 3c and M. respectively. The normal ORF 3a product is 57 amino acids long, whereas a 43 bp deletion was detected at the 3â€² end of the CK/CH/LSD/03I 3a gene, resulting in a frameshift event and a C-terminally truncated protein with 47 amino acids. Comparison of growth capacity in embryos and replication and pathogenicity in chickens with IBVs carrying the normal 3a gene indicated that this deleted sequence in the CK/CH/LSD/03I gene 3a was not required for viral pathogenesis and replication. in vitro or in vivo. The occurrence of a mutation at the corresponding position of the start codon CK/CH/LLN/98I in the 3a gene led to the absence of ORF 3a in this virus, resulting in a new genomic organization in the coding regions of 3â€ ²: S-3b, 3c-M-5a, 5b-N. Comparison with other viruses carrying the normal 3a gene revealed that CK/CH/LLN/98I had similar replication capabilities and in vivo pathogenicity as other IBVs; however, its growth capacity in embryos was lower, although the relationship between the lower growth capacity and the ORF 3a defect requires further confirmation. © 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Liu, S.;Zhang, Q.;Chen, J.;Han, Z.;Shao, Y.;Kong, X.;Tong, G.",2008.0,,10.1016/j.gene.2008.01.004,0
1220,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection induced intestinal microbiota imbalance in piglets,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a devastating disease in the livestock industry. Most of the previous studies related to PED focused on the pathology and etiology of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Little was known about the state of the gut microbiota after PEDV-infected piglets. In this study, with the help of metagenome sequencing technology, gut microbiota profiles in faeces of viral diarrhea (VD) and viral control (VC) piglets were investigated. The results showed that the abundance of four dominant phyla (Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Proteobacteria) in faeces was greatly affected by porcine epidemic diarrhea. Especially, the abundance of fusobacteria was higher in VD piglets (36%) than in VC piglets (5%). In contrast, Verrucomicrobia was detected in a lower distribution proportion in VD piglets (around 0%) than in VC piglets (20%). Furthermore, 25 genders were significantly different between VC and VD piglets at the gender level. Among the 25 genera, Leptotrichia belonging to Fusobacteria was markedly lower in VC piglets than in VD piglets. Akkermansia belonging to Verrucomicrobia was higher in VC piglets than in VD piglets.

1221,Identification of natural recombination in duck hepatitis B virus,"Due to its close similarity to human hepatitis B virus (HBV), duck HBV (DHBV) is often used as an important model for HBV research. Although intergenotypic recombination of HBV is common, it has not been reported with DHBV. In this study, 32 non-redundant DHBV whole genomes were analyzed using phylogenetic methods and classified into two groups, corresponding to the previously reported 'Chinese' and 'Western country' branches based on geographical distribution. One 'Chinese' branch strain was isolated in Australia and three 'Western country' branch strains were isolated in China, suggesting cross-geographical distribution of both branches. Recombination analyzes of the 32 DHBV genomes identified two possible intergenotypic recombination events with a high confidence value. These recombination events occurred between the lineages represented, respectively, by the Chinese isolate GD3 (AY536371, 'Chinese' branch) and the US isolate DHBV16 (K01834, 'Western country' branch), giving rise to two recombinant Chinese CH4 isolates (EU429324). ) and CH6 (EU429326).

This disease is more prevalent in the South, Southeast and East Asia region. In this study, two strains of JEV, named JEV/SW/GD/01/2009 and JEV/SW/GZ/09/2004, were isolated from aborted fetuses and seminal fluid of pigs in China. To determine the characteristics of these virus isolates, the virulence of two new JEV isolates was investigated, the result showed that JEV/SW/GD/01/2009 did not kill mice, while JEV/SW/GZ/ 09/2004 showed neurovirulence at 0.925log10 pfu/LD50. In addition, the complete genome sequences of JEV were determined and compared to other known JEV strains. The results showed that the genome of two JEV isolates was 10,976 nucleotides (nt) in length. Compared to the Chinese vaccine strain SA14-14-2, JEV/SW/GD/01/2009 and JEV/SW/GZ/09/2004 showed 99.7% and 97.5% identity at the nucleotide level, 99.6% and 96.7% identity at the amino acid level, respectively. Genome-based phylogenetic analysis revealed that two JEV isolates clustered into genotype III compared to the reference strains. Furthermore, selection analyzes revealed that the dominant selection pressure acting on the JEV genome was purifying selection. Four sites under positive selection were identified: codon 521 (amino acid E-227), 2296 (amino acid NS4b-24), 3048 (amino acid NS5-521), and 3055 (amino acid NS5-528). The amino acid E-227 was shown to be related to neurovirulence.

Comprehensive analysis of the miRNA profiles showed that 239 annotated miRNAs were detected in the database and 355 new miRNAs encoded per pig. Of these, 130 miRNAs showed significant differential expression between PCMV-infected and non-infected porcine macrophages. The 10 differentially expressed pig-encoded miRNAs were further determined by stem-loop reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the results were consistent with high-throughput sequencing. Gene ontology analysis of miRNA target genes in PCMV-infected porcine macrophages showed that differentially expressed miRNAs are primarily involved in immune and metabolic processes.

Although recent studies have shown that miRNAs play an important role in immune responses, the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during infection by immunosuppressive viruses remain unclear. Methods: In this study, porcine small RNA transcriptomes from PCMV-infected and uninfected vital organs were first characterized by high-throughput sequencing. miRDeep2 software was used to predict novel pig-encoded miRNAs. To verify the accuracy of the high-throughput sequencing results, stem-loop qRT-PCR was performed on 12 significantly ED miRNAs. Physical and functional interactions between immunity-related target genes of DE miRNAs in PCMV-infected organs were analyzed using the STRING database. Results: In total, 306 annotated and 295 new miRNAs were identified from PCMV-infected and uninfected porcine organs, respectively, through alignment with known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs. Overall, 92, 107, 95, 77, and 111 miRNAs were significantly differently expressed in lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and thymus after PCMV infection, respectively. Based on Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, target genes for differentially expressed miRNAs associated with immune system processes, regulation of biological processes, and metabolic processes were enriched in each sample. Integrated expression analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs and their target mRNAs in PCMV-infected thymus showed that significant differential expression of specific miRNAs under pressure of PCMV infection in central immune organs interfered with the expression of genes involved in important signaling pathways related to the immune system, thus promoting viral infection.

Pathogenicity experiments performed in this study indicated that the virus was highly pathogenic for chickens but low pathogenic for mammalian hosts, as evidenced by reduced infection in mice. Analysis of whole genome sequences and genetic evolution showed that A/Swan/Shanghai/10/09 (SW/SH/09) may be derived from strain A/silky chicken/Shantou/475/2004 (CK/ST/ 04), which is homologous to influenza viruses isolated from chicken, duck, pika, little egret, swan, mandarin duck, and barred-headed goose in Hunan China, Qinghai China, Mongolia, Russia, Japan, Korea, Laos, and Hong Kong during 2007-2011, indicating that the virus has retroinfected various wild birds from chickens, and that the virus is still spreading significantly through overlapping migration routes.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a regulatory role in viral infection and may be involved in the immune response of mammals. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of host miRNA expression in TGEV-infected porcine testis (ST) cells. Deep sequencing generated 3,704,353 and 2,763,665 reads from uninfected ST cells and infected ST cells, respectively. Reads were aligned with known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs in miRBase 19, identifying 284 annotated miRNAs.

1229,Phylogenetic Diversity and Genotypic Complexity of H1N1 Subtype Swine Influenza Viruses Isolated in Mainland China,"Background: After the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, swine influenza viruses of the H1N1 subtype (SIV H1N1) have been given special attention by scientific communities in many countries. A large-scale sequence analysis of the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource Database was performed on H1N1 SIVs reported primarily by scientists in China between 1992 and 2011. The goals of this study were to elucidate the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of H1N1 SIVs, to identify and unify the lineages and genetic characteristics of H1N1 SIVs isolated in mainland China. Results: Most of the strains were isolated during the period of 2008 to 2010 from Guangdong and Shandong provinces, China. Based on phylogenetic and genotypic analyses, all SIV H1N1 strains can be classified into 8 lineages and 10 genotypes. All strains had the characteristics of low pathogenicity influenza viruses. Viruses of different lineages are characterized by different amino acid residues at receptor binding sites. Viruses containing PB2 genes from the classical porcine, early seasonal human, and recent seasonal human lineage might be more infectious to humans. Some genotypes were directly related to human influenza viruses, including strains harboring genes derived from human influenza viruses. Conclusions: Phylogenetic diversity and complexity existed in H1N1 SIVs isolated in mainland China. These H1N1 SIV strains were closely related to other influenza virus subtypes, especially human influenza viruses. Furthermore, new lineages and genotypes of SIV H1N1 were shown to have recently emerged in mainland China.

Methods: We retrospectively reclassified clinical enterovirus isolates from the previous 4.5 years in our virology laboratory using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and reviewed the clinical manifestations of 138 pediatric patients. Results: We reclassified 23 isolates from the five serotypes into the HEV-A group, 110 isolates from 16 serotypes into the HEV-B group, five isolates into the HEV-C group, and no isolates from the HEV-D group. HEV-A species caused significantly more hand-foot-and-mouth disease (p < 0.001), herpangina (p = 0.029), and myoclonic spasms (p < 0.001) compared to HEV-B species. However, HEV-B species caused significantly more pharyngitis (p = 0.043), respiratory tract infections (p = 0.046), nausea and vomiting (p = 0.007), and aseptic meningitis (p = 0.001). The only death in our report was caused by coxsackievirus A16, which belonged to the HEV-A group. Conclusion: The association between the molecular classification of enteroviruses and related disease patterns is an important finding. We suggest that this molecular classification could be applied in a clinical laboratory as an alternative method in certain circumstances, such as limited availability of antisera or questionable serotyping results, to identify nontypable isolates. © 2010 Taiwan Society for Microbiology.",,"Lo, C.

1231,Origin and evolution of the Nipah virus,"Nipah virus, a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, is classified as a biosafety level 4 agent and a category C priority pathogen. Nipah virus disease is endemic in South Asia and outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia, Singapore, India and Bangladesh. Bats of the Pteropus genus seem to be the natural reservoir of this virus. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity of Nipah virus, to estimate the date of origin and spread of infection. The mean value of the Nipah virus N gene evolution rate was 6.5 × 10-4 substitution/site/year (95% HPD: 2.3 × 10-4-1.18 × 10-3). Time-scale phylogenetic analysis showed that the root of the tree originated in 1947 (95% HPD: 1888-1988) when the virus entered the Southeast Asian regions. The segregation of sequences into two main clades (I and II) indicates that the Nipah virus had two different introductions: one in 1995 (95% HPD: 1985-2002) corresponding to clade I, and the other in 1985 (95% HPD : 1971-1996) that correspond to clade II. The phylogeographic reconstruction indicated that the epidemic followed two different routes, spreading to the other localities. Trade in infected pigs may have played a role in the spread of the virus. Bats of the genus Pteropus, which can travel long distances, may have contributed to the spread of the infection. Statistically supported negatively selected sites could reflect the stability of the viral N protein.",,"Lo Presti, A.;Cella, E.;Giovanetti, M.;Lai, A.;Angeletti, S.;Zehender, G.;Ciccozzi, M.",2016.0,,10.1002/jmv.24345,0
1232,Comparative genomics reveals multiple pathways to mutualism for tick-borne pathogens,"BACKGROUND: Multiple important human and livestock pathogens employ ticks as their main host vectors. It is not currently known whether this means of infecting a host arose once or several times during evolution. RESULTS: To address this question, we performed a comparative genomic analysis on a set of bacterial pathogens from seven genera: Borrelia, Rickettsia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Francisella, Coxiella, and Bartonella, including species from three different vector hosts: ticks, lice, and fleas. The final set of 102 genomes used in the study encoded a total of 120,046 protein sequences. We found that there were no genes or metabolic pathways present in all tick-borne bacteria. However, we found that some genes and pathways were present in subsets of tick-borne organisms while they were absent in lice- or flea-borne bacteria. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that the ability of pathogens to be transmitted by ticks arose several times throughout evolution. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of tick transmissibility to date.",,"Lockwood, S.;Brayton, K. A.;Broschat, S. L.",2016.0,07 02,,0
1233,A universal protocol for generating consensus-level genomic sequences for foot-and-mouth disease virus and other positive-sense polyadenylated RNA viruses using the Illumina MiSeq,"BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is revolutionizing molecular epidemiology by providing new approaches to perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) in diagnostic settings for a variety of human and veterinary pathogens. Previous sequencing protocols have been subject to biases such as those encountered during PCR amplification and cell culture, or are restricted by the need for large amounts of starting material. We describe here a simple and robust methodology for the generation of complete genomic sequences on the Illumina MiSeq. This protocol is specific for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) or other polyadenylated RNA viruses and avoids both the use of PCR and the requirement for large amounts of initial template. RESULTS: The protocol was successfully validated using five clinical samples positive for FMD virus from the 2001 UK epidemic, as well as a panel of viruses representative of all seven serotypes. Furthermore, this protocol was successfully used to recover 94% of an FMD virus genome that had previously been identified as cell culture negative. Genomic sequences of three other non-FMD virus polyadenylated RNA viruses (EMCV, ERAV, VESV) were also obtained with minor amendments to the protocol. We calculated that a minimum coverage depth of 22 reads was required to produce an accurate consensus sequence for FMDV O. This was achieved in 5 isolates of FMDV/O/UKG and type O FMDV from the serotype panel with the exception of the 5' genomic ends and the area immediately flanking the poly(C) region. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a universal WGS method for foot-and-mouth disease virus and other polyadenylated RNA viruses. This method works successfully from a limited amount of starting material and eliminates the requirement for genome-specific PCR amplification. This protocol has the potential to generate consensus-level sequences within a high-throughput routine diagnostic setting.",,"Logan, G.;Freimanis, G. L.;King, D.

1234,Unbiased characterization of Anopheles mosquito blood meals by targeted high-throughput sequencing,"Understanding mosquito host choice is important to assess vector competence or identify disease reservoirs. Unfortunately, the availability of an unbiased method to comprehensively assess the composition of insect blood meals is very limited, as most current molecular assays only test for the presence of a few preselected species. These approaches are also limited in their ability to identify the presence of multiple mammalian hosts in a single blood meal. Here, we describe a new high-throughput sequencing method that enables the analysis of 96 mosquitoes simultaneously and provides a comprehensive and quantitative perspective on the composition of each blood meal. We validated in silico that universal primers targeting mammalian mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) genes should amplify greater than 95% of the mammalian 16S rRNA sequences present in the NCBI nucleotide database. We applied this method to 442 female Anopheles punctulatus sl mosquitoes collected in Papua New Guinea (PNG). While humans (52.9%), dogs (15.8%), and pigs (29.2%) were the most common hosts identified in our study, we also detected DNA from mice, one marsupial species, and two bat species . Our analyzes also revealed that 16.3% of the mosquitoes fed on more than one host. Analysis of human mitochondrial hypervariable region I in 102 human blood samples showed that 5 (4.9%) of the mosquitoes unequivocally fed on more than one person. Overall, the analysis of PNG mosquitoes illustrates the potential of this approach to identify unsuspected hosts and characterize mixed blood meals, and shows how this approach can be adapted to assess interindividual variations among human blood meals. Furthermore, this approach can be applied to any disease-transmitting arthropod and can be easily customized to investigate non-mammalian host sources.",,"Logue, K.;Keven, J. B.;Cannon, M.

1236,Columbian circovirus detected in free-ranging pigeons from southern Brazil: information on the evolution of PiCV,"Pigeon circovirus (PiCV) is taxonomically classified as a member of the genus Circovirus, family Circoviridae. The virus contains a single-stranded DNA genome of approximately 2 kb, with small variations in length between different isolates. The occurrence of PiCV infections in pigeons (Columba livia) has been documented worldwide over the last 20 years; however, in Brazil there were still no reports of detection of PiCV. This study identifies seven PiCV genomes recovered from domestic pigeons from southern Brazil through high-throughput sequencing and shows a high frequency of PiCV infection, through quantitative real-time PCR. Phylogenetic classification was performed by maximum likelihood analysis of the complete genomes, ORF V1 (Rep) and ORF C1 (Cap). The results show that the analysis based on the whole genome or Cap allowed the classification of PiCV in five main clades (groups A to E), where the Brazilian sequences were classified as A, C or D. Recombination analyzes were carried out with Simplot and RDP4 and the results show that both the Rep and Cap ORFs contain several recombination critical points, pointing to an important role for such events in PiCV evolution.",,"Loiko, M.

1237,Fecal viroma of red foxes from peri-urban areas,"Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are the most abundant carnivore species in the northern hemisphere. Since their populations are well established in peri-urban and urban areas, they represent a potential reservoir for viruses that are transmitted from wildlife to humans or domestic animals. In this study, we evaluated the fecal virome of juvenile and adult foxes from peri-urban areas in central Croatia. The dominant mammalian viruses were fox picobirnavirus and parvovirus. The highest number of viral reads (N = 1412) was attributed to a new fox circovirus and the entire viral genome was assembled de novo from high-throughput sequencing data. Fox circovirus is very similar to canine circoviruses identified in sick dogs in the US and Italy, and to a recently discovered circovirus in neurologically ill foxes in the UK. Our fox picobirnavirus was more closely related to porcine and human picobirnaviruses than to known fox picobirnaviruses.",,"LojkiÄ‡, I.;Bidin, M.;PrpiÄ‡, J.;Å imiÄ‡, I.;KreÅ¡iÄ‡, N.;BedekoviÄ‡, T.",2016.0,,10.1016/j.cimid.2016.01.005,0

1240,Specificity of the antibody against viral polymerase RD 114,"The use of antiserum against RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDP) of type C viruses has made it possible to distinguish these enzymes from cellular enzymes that are capable of using RNA templates for DNA synthesis. Such sera have also allowed some degree of subclassification of the viruses themselves and also distinction between other RDP-containing viruses. Thus, within the type C family, viper, chicken, and mammalian viruses are easily distinguished, whereas, within the mammalian group, polymerases from two new primate isolates, the woolly monkey and the gibbon monkey, appear to be similar. other than viruses of lower mammals. The recently described RD 114 virus, which is currently being considered as a human candidate virus, was also distinguished from lower mammalian viruses by polymerase inhibition tests. The major internal protein of RD 114 virus is distinct from all other type C viruses both antigenically and by virtue of a single isoelectric point. In the absence of other criteria for species classification, it was suggested that polymerase inhibition tests might provide evidence for a group of primate viruses that would hopefully include RD 114. If so, this would provide strong evidence. circumstantial evidence of the human origin of RD 114. Experiments with a hyperimmune guinea pig antiserum prepared against purified RD 114 RDP are described in this report. The RDP RD 114 appears to be more closely related to the RDP of two primate viruses than to the RDP of viruses of lower mammals and non-mammalian species. The enzyme is also distinct from a RD cell activity that can use RNA templates.",,"Long, C.;Sachs, R.;Norvell, J.",1973.0,,,0

1242,"Bacteria, phages and pigs: the effects of in-feed antibiotics on the microbiome at different sites in the gut","Disruption of the beneficial gut microbial community is a possible side effect of antibiotics, which have many uses in animal agriculture (treatment or prevention of disease and improvement of feed efficiency). Understanding the effects of antibiotics on bacterial communities in different intestinal locations is essential to realizing the full benefits and consequences of antibiotics in feed. In this study, we define the bacterial communities of the lumen and mucosa of the small intestine (ileum) and large intestine (cecum and colon) plus feces, and characterize the effects of antibiotics in the feed (chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine, and penicillin ( ASP250)) in these communities. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic analyzes of bacterial membership and functions revealed dramatic differences between small and large intestinal locations, including enrichment of Firmicutes and phage-encoding genes in the ileum. The large intestine microbiota encoded numerous genes to degrade plant cell wall components, and these genes were missing in the ileum. The mucosa-associated ileal microbiota harbored greater bacterial diversity than the lumen, but similar membership to the mucosa of the large intestine, suggesting that most gut microbes can associate with the mucosa and could serve as inoculum for the lumen. . Side effects on the microbiota of antibiotic-fed animals caused a divergence from control animals, with notable changes such as increases in populations of Escherichia coli in the ileum, Lachnobacterium spp. in all intestinal locations and antibiotic resistance genes not administered. Characterizing the differential metabolic capacities and response to disturbance at different intestinal sites will inform strategies to improve intestinal health and food safety.",,"Looft, T.;Allen, H.

1244,Automated classification of tailed bacteriophages based on their neck organization,"Background: The genetic diversity observed among bacteriophages remains a major obstacle for the identification of homologues and the comparison of their functional modules. In the structural module, although several classes of homologous proteins can be detected that contribute to the structure of the head and tail, the proteins of the head-tail (or neck) connection are generally more divergent. However, molecular analyzes of some tailed phages belonging to different morphological classes suggested that only a limited number of structural solutions are used to produce a functional virion. To challenge this hypothesis and analyze protein diversity in the virion neck, we developed a specific computational strategy to deal with sequence divergence in phage proteins. We searched for homologues of a set of structural module-encoded proteins using a phage learning database. Results: We demonstrate that using a combination of iterative profile-to-profile comparison and genetic context analysis, we can identify a set of head, neck, and tail proteins in most of the tailed bacteriophages in our database. Phage classification based on neck protein sequences delimits 4 types corresponding to known morphological subfamilies. Further analysis of the most abundant type 1 yields 10 clusters characterized by consistent sets of head, neck, and tail proteins. We developed Virfam, a web server that automatically identifies phage head, neck, and tail module proteins and assigns phages to the most closely related group of phages. This server was tested with 624 new phages from the NCBI database. 93% of tailed and unclassified phages could be assigned to our head, neck, and tail-based categories, highlighting the high representativeness of the identified virion architectures. The types and groups delimit consistent subgroups of Caudovirales, which correlate with various properties of the virion. Conclusions: Our method and web server have the ability to automatically classify most tailed phages, detect their structural module, assign a function to a set of their head, neck, and tail genes, provide their morphological subtype, and locate these phages inside a ""head-neck"". sorting based on ""queue"". It should allow the analysis of large sets of phage genomes. In particular, it should contribute to the classification of the abundant unknown viruses found in assembled contigs from metagenomic samples.",,"Lopes, A.;Tavares, P.;Petit, M.

1245,Mapping of rotavirus VP6 protein epitope subsets,"VP6, the most abundant rotavirus protein, contains epitopes that allow these viruses to be classified into four subgroups (SG), based on the presence or absence of two epitopes called I and II. Subgroup-specific epitopes are conformational and appear to be present on trimeric but not monomeric VP6. We have identified in VP6 some of the amino acids that determine the reactivity of the 255/60 and 631/9 subgroup-specific mAbs. A single amino acid mutation at positions 172 (Met to Ala) or 305 (Asn to Ala) was sufficient to change the subgroup specificity of the human rotavirus Wa VP6 protein from SGII to SGI/II, since either of these mutations allowed the protein to be recognized by the SGI mAb 255/60, while maintaining its ability to interact with the SGII mAb 631/9. In the case of the SGII epitope, the mutation of two contiguous amino acids (Ala305 Asn306 to Asn305 Ala306) in the porcine rotavirus YM VP6 (SGI) protein allowed the protein to be efficiently recognized by the SGII mAb 631/9, while causing YM VP6 Protein to increase its ability to interact with mAb 255/60. These results suggest that both subgroups of mAbs interact with an antigenic domain in VP6 that is composed of at least two regions of the protein that, although distant in the linear sequence, could be very close in the structured trimer of VP6.",,"Lopez, S.;Espinosa, R.;Greenberg, H.

Further discrimination was possible by analysis of the sequence data from the E2 region. The three sequencing-based methods were compared with monoclonal antibody (MAb) typing and limited restriction enzyme (RE) mapping. Although both the MAb and RE methods confirmed the above classification, the resolution was inferior. We estimated a rough rate of evolution for CSFV from an analysis of virus variation observed in a single geographic area over a 6-year period.

Fifty-one virus-positive samples of brain tissue from various animal and human species were studied. Material from these samples was used to infect mice, whose brains were subsequently analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence, using the monoclonal antibodies described above. The virus strains that showed antigenic variations were sent to the Pasteur Institute in Paris for confirmation of the results. No mouse brain sample showed a pattern of antigenic reactivity that would indicate the presence of a Lyssavirus other than the classic rabies virus. However, four antigenic variations of classical rabies serotype 1 were found. The antibody panel was considered useful for the rapid classification of the rabies virus in Mexico. It is possible that autochthonous antigenic variations are appearing among the strains that circulate in that country, a scenario that could explain some of the failures observed with certain vaccines. For this reason, there is a need to produce monoclonal antinucleocapsid antibodies with rabies virus strains indigenous to the area.",,"Loza-Rubio, E.;Vargas, R.;HernÃ¡ndez, E.;Batalla, D.;Aguilar-SetiÃ©n, A.",1995.0,,,0

The virus possesses a large positive-sense RNA genome encoding a single polyprotein that shares physicochemical properties with those of its members. of the Picornaviridae family. The 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) plays an important role in picornavirus translation initiation, as it contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that mediates cap-independent translation. To investigate translation in EoPV, a wide range of mutations within the 5' UTR were engineered and the effects of these changes were examined in vitro and in vivo using a bicistronic construct. The results showed that deletions within the first 63 nt had little impact on IRES activity, while the core IRES function was contained within loops C and D, as their deletion significantly abrogated IRES activity. In contrast to these findings, deletion of stem-loop G containing two cryptic AUGs caused a marked increase in IRES activity, which was further investigated by site-directed mutagenesis at these two positions. It was also confirmed that the initiation of protein synthesis occurs at AUG6 (position 391-394) and not at AUG immediately downstream of the polypyrimidine stretch. The polypyrimidine tract mutation (CCTTTC) had a slight effect on EoPV IRES activity. Furthermore, mutations of the RAAA motif resulted in decreased IRES activity of approximately 40% in vitro, but these results were not supported by in vivo experiments. In conclusion, this study reveals that the EoPV IRES element is unique, although it has features in common with type II IRES.",,"Lu, J.;Zhang, J. M.;Wang, X. C.;Jiang, H.;Liu, C. F.;Hu, Y.

1253,Phylogenetic Analysis of Eight Genes of Influenza Virus Subtype H9N2: A Mainland Chinese Strain Possessing Genes from Early Isolates That Have Been Circulating,"Influenza virus subtype H9N2 has become global and prevalent in China. Earlier studies illustrated that at least three landbird sublineages had been established from Eurasian birds. In this presentation, eight complete genes were obtained from an H9N2 strain, A/Chicken/Shanghai/F/98 (Ck/SH/F/98). Sequence analyzes and phylogenetic studies were performed comparing eight genes with those of all H9N2 strains available from GenBank. The results showed that four genes (HA, NA, M and NS genes) of Ck/SH/F/98 were incorporated into the sublineage represented by the early Chinese mainland strain, Ck/BJ/1/94. However, the other four RNP genes of Ck/SH/F/98 did not show a close relationship with those of viruses of the three known sublineages. Therefore, Ck/SH/F/98 was a natural rearrangement between different sublineages. Furthermore, the comparison showed that Ck/SH/F/98 could be a putative precursor to a later isolate from southern China, Dk/ST/1605/01, with at least six genes from both closely related, indicating genes of Ck/SH /F/98 and the first isolates had once been circulating. Further comparison in terms of HA1 species-specific molecular markers revealed that DK/ST/1605/01 also more closely resembled Ck/SH/F/98 than a common earlier strain of duck. The results supported the idea of bidirectional transmission between land and waterfowl, emphasizing the importance of raising concerns about the natural evolution of the eight genes of H9N2 avian influenza viruses. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"Lu, J.

1254,Turkey faecal microbial community structure and functional gene diversity revealed by 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequences,"The main objective of this study was to better understand the microbial composition and functional genetic diversity associated with turkey fecal communities. To achieve this, libraries of 16S rRNA genes and metagenomic clones were sequenced from turkey faecal samples. Analysis of 382 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the most abundant bacteria were closely related to Lactobacillales (47%), Bacillales (31%), and Clostridiales (11%). Sequences from Actinomycetales, Enterobacteriales and Bacteroidales were also identified, but represented a smaller part of the community. Analysis of 379 metagenomic sequences showed that the majority of clones were similar to bacterial protein sequences (58%). Bacteriophage (10%) and avian virus (3%) sequences were also depicted. Of all the metagenomic clones potentially encoding bacterial proteins, the majority were similar to low G+C Gram-positive bacterial proteins, particularly from Lactobacillales (50%), Bacillales (11%) and Clostridiales (8%). Bioinformatic analyzes suggested the presence of genes encoding membrane proteins, lipoproteins, hydrolases, and functional genes associated with the metabolism of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds. The results of this study further confirmed the dominance of Firmicutes in the avian gut and highlight the value of coupling 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing data analysis to study the microbial composition of avian fecal microbial communities.",,"Lu, J.

1255,The goose genome sequence provides insight into the evolution of waterfowl and susceptibility to fatty liver,"Background: Geese were domesticated more than 6,000 years ago, making them one of the earliest domesticated birds. Geese are capable of rapid growth, resistant to disease and have a high lipid storage capacity in the liver, and can easily feed on coarse forage. Here, we sequence and analyze the whole genome sequence of an economically important goose breed in China and compare it to that of land bird species. Results: A draft complete goose genome sequence was obtained by shotgun sequencing and 16,150 protein-coding genes were predicted. Comparative genomics indicates that there are significant differences between the goose genome and that of other landbird species, particularly with respect to major histocompatibility complex, myxovirus resistance, retinoic acid-inducible gene I, and other related genes. with disease resistance in geese. Furthermore, analysis of the transcriptome data further reveals a potential molecular mechanism involved in the susceptibility of geese to fatty liver disease and its associated symptoms, including high levels of unsaturated fatty acids and low levels of cholesterol. The results of this study show that the deletion of the goose lepeza gene could be the result of positive selection, allowing the liver to adopt energy storage mechanisms for long-distance migration. Conclusions: This is the first report that describes the complete sequence of the goose genome and contributes to the genomic resources available for the study of waterfowl. The findings of this study are useful not only for breeding programs, but also for studying lipid metabolism disorders.",,"Lu, L.;Chen, Y.;Wang, Z.;Li, X.;Chen, W.;Tao, Z.;Shen, J.;Tian, Y.;Wang, D.;Li, G.;Chen, L.;Chen, F.;Fang, D.;Yu, L.;Sun, Y.;Ma, Y.;Li, J.;Wang, J.",2015.0,,10.1186/s13059-015-0652-y,0

1257,Beyond Genome-Wide Consensus: Unraveling PRRSV Phylogenomics Using Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies Review,"The highly heterogeneous porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent responsible for an economically important swine disease with the characteristic symptoms of reproductive losses in breeding sows and respiratory diseases in young piglets. The virus can be broadly divided into European and North American type 1 and 2 genotypes, respectively. In addition to this variability within strains, much attention has recently been paid to the impact of coexisting viral quasispecies on disease development; largely due to the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Genomic data produced from the massive sequencing capabilities of NGS have enabled the study of PRRSV at unprecedented speed and detail. Unlike conventional sequencing methods that require knowledge of conserved regions, NGS enables de novo assembly of entire viral genomes. The evolutionary variations obtained from different genotypic strains provide valuable information about functionally important regions of the virus. Along with the advancement of sophisticated bioinformatics tools, ultra-deep NGS technologies make detection of low-frequency co-evolutionary quasispecies possible. This short review provides an overview, including a proposed workflow, on the use of NGS to explore the genetic diversity of PRRSV at both macro and microevolutionary levels.",,"Lu, Z.

1258,Genomic Variation in European Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus Cultured in Olot/91 Macrophages Revealed by Next-Generation Ultra-Deep Sequencing,"BACKGROUND: Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is a disease of great economic impact worldwide. The aetiological agent of this disease is the PRRS virus (PRRSV). Mounting evidence suggests that microevolution within a population of coexisting quasispecies may give rise to high sequence heterogeneity in PRRSV. FINDINGS: We developed a pipeline based on the next-generation ultra-deep sequencing approach to first construct the complete genome of a European PRRSV, strain Olot/9, grown in macrophages and then capture the rare variants representative of the mixed quasispecies population. Olot/91 differs from the reference Lelystad strain by approximately 5% and a total of 88 variants, with frequencies as low as 1%, were detected in the mixed population. These variants included 16 non-synonymous variants concentrated in genes encoding structural and nonstructural proteins; including glycoproteins 2a and 5. CONCLUSION: Using ultra-deep sequencing methodology, the complete genome of Olot/91 was constructed without any prior knowledge of the sequence. Rare variants that make up minor fractions of the heterogeneous PRRSV population could be successfully detected to allow further exploration of microevolutionary events.",,"Lu, Z.

Another sample showed the presence of three bands (2.92, 2.37 and 1.32 kbp in apparent length) which were shown by enzymatic digestion analysis to consist of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The sample was shown by electron microscopy to contain virus particles with a diameter of 32-34 nm. On the basis of morphology and genomic features, this virus closely resembles a virus previously described only in chickens by Leite et al. in 1990 and tentatively named 'picotrirnavirus'. From the same group of 214, one sample was also identified as containing a 'picobirnavirus'. Thus, small icosahedral viruses with a bisegmented or trisegmented dsRNA genome appear to infect humans.

Cameroon presents a unique opportunity for epidemiological studies because FMD vaccination is not practised. We carried out a prospective study including serological, antigenic and genetic aspects of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infections among different livestock production systems in the Far North of Cameroon to gain insights into the natural ecology of the virus. We found serological evidence of FMDV infection in more than 75% of sampled animals with no significant differences in prevalence observed between sampled groups (ie market, sedentary, cross-border and mobile trade). We also found reactive antibodies to five of the seven FMD virus serotypes (A, O, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3) among the animals sampled. Finally, we were able to genetically characterize viruses obtained from clinical and subclinical FMD infections in Cameroon. Serotype O viruses are grouped into two topotypes (West and East Africa). SAT2 viruses clustered with viruses from Central and North Africa, particularly within the sublineage that caused the major epidemic in North Africa in 2012, suggesting a common origin for these viruses. This research will guide future interventions for FMD control, such as improved diagnostics, guidance for vaccine formulation, and epidemiological understanding in support of progressive FMD control in Cameroon.",,"Ludi, A.;Ahmed, Z.;Pomeroy, L.

Phylogenetic analysis of the partial 3D genomic region suggested that a bat virus belonged to the species Enterovirus G (EV-G, formerly Porcine enterovirus B). Bat infection was supported by relatively high EV-G concentrations of 1.1 × 106 RNA copies per gram of feces. All other bat viruses belonged to the bat-associated genus Mischivirus or to an unclassified group Picornaviridae distantly related to the genus Sapelovirus. Members of this unclassified sapelovirus-related group had secondary RNA structures in their 3' untranslated regions that were typical of enteroviruses and resembled structures that occur in bat-associated coronaviruses, suggesting events of ancient recombination. Based on sequence distances, it is likely that several European and Chinese bat picornaviruses were conspecific, suggesting connectivity of virus populations. Due to their high mutation rates and their diversity, picornaviruses can be useful tools for studies of bat and virus ecology.",,"Lukashev, A. N.;Corman, V.

1263,Evolutionary relationships among parvoviruses: virus-host coevolution among primate autonomous parvoviruses and links between adeno-associated and avian parvoviruses,"The current classification of parvoviruses is based on the host range of the virus and the dependency on the helper virus, while little data is available on the evolutionary relationships between the viruses. We identified and analyzed 472 parvovirus sequences, including (virtually) complete genomes of all 41 viruses currently recognized as individual species within the family Parvoviridae. Our phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes, as well as open reading frames, distinguished three evolutionary groups of vertebrate parvoviruses: (i) the human helper-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes 1 to 6 and the autonomous avian parvoviruses; (ii) bovine, chipmunk, and autonomous primate parvoviruses, including human B19 and V9 viruses; and (iii) parvoviruses from rodents (except chipmunks), carnivores, and pigs. Each of these three evolutionary groups could be further subdivided, reflecting both virus-host coevolution and the multiple interspecies transmissions in the evolutionary history of parvoviruses. There are no invertebrate parvoviruses grouped with vertebrate parvoviruses. Our analysis provided evidence for negative selection among parvoviruses, the independent evolution of their genes, and recombination among rodent parvoviruses. The topology of the phylogenetic tree of human and ape autonomous parvoviruses exactly matched the topology of the primate family tree, as based on analysis of primate mitochondrial DNA. Viruses belonging to the AAV group were not evolutionarily linked to other palmate parvoviruses, but were linked to avian parvoviruses. The two human parvovirus lineages may have resulted from ancient independent zoonotic infections. Our results provide an argument for the reclassification of the Parvovirinae based on the evolutionary relationships between the viruses.",,"Lukashov, V.

1264,Evolutionary relationships between Astroviridae,"To study the evolutionary relationships among astroviruses, all available sequences for members of the Astroviridae family were collected. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished two deep-seated groups: one comprising mammalian astroviruses, with sheep astrovirus being an outlier, and the other comprising avian astroviruses. All virus species, as well as human astrovirus serotypes, represented individual lineages within the tree. All human viruses clustered together and separately from non-human viruses, arguing for their common evolutionary origin and against ongoing animal-to-human transmissions. The branching order of mammalian astroviruses was exactly the opposite of that of their host species, suggesting at least two interspecies transmissions involving pigs, cats, and humans, possibly via intermediate hosts. Analysis of synonymous (Ds) versus non-synonymous (Da) distances revealed that negative selection dominates in astrovirus evolution, with Ds:Da ratios as high as 46 for comparisons of the most closely related viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes of all D-based open reading frames (ORFs) resulted in the loss of tree structures, with virus species, and in ORF2, even human astrovirus serotypes, branching from virtually a single node, which suggests their former separation. The strong selection against non-synonymous substitutions, whose low number, therefore, is not evidence of a recent separation between lineages, together with the position of the oldest available human astrovirus strain (1971) far from the common node of its serotype 4 , suggest that intraserotype diversification has its origin at an earlier date.",,"Lukashov, V.

1265,In silico identification of plant miRNAs in mammalian breast milk exosomes: a small step forward?,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by inhibiting protein translation or by targeting mRNA cleavage. They play many important roles in the cells of living organisms; however, knowledge about the functions of miRNAs has expanded following their identification in biological fluids and recent reports on the abundance of plant-derived miRNAs in human plasma and serum. Taking these findings into account, we performed a rigorous bioinformatic analysis of publicly available raw data from high-throughput sequencing studies on miRNA composition in human and porcine breast milk exosomes to identify the fraction of food-derived miRNAs. Various processing and filtering steps were applied to increase accuracy and avoid false positives. Using the aforementioned analysis, 35 and 17 miRNA species were identified, belonging to 25 and 11 MIR families, respectively. In human samples, the highest abundance levels yielded ath-miR166a, pab-miR951, ptc-miR472a, and bdi-miR168, while zma-miR168a, zma-miR156a, and ath-miR166a were identified in porcine breast milk exosomes. . the largest amounts. Consensus prediction and annotation of potential human targets for selected plant miRNAs suggest that the aforementioned molecules may interact with mRNAs encoding various transcription factors, protein receptors, transporters, and immune-related proteins, potentially influence the human body. Taken together, the presented analysis shows evidence of abundant plant miRNAs in mammalian breast milk exosomes, at the same time pointing to new possibilities arising from this discovery.",,"Lukasik, A.;Zielenkiewicz, P.",2014.0,Jun,,0

Despite the endemic nature of BPV infections, identification of BPV types in Brazilian cattle is still sporadic. However, in a recent analysis of a partial segment of the L1 gene, we observed a remarkable diversity among the BPV types detected. The objective of this study was to determine the phylogenetic position of the previously identified wild strain BPV/BR-UEL2 detected in the state of Paraná in Brazil. Since previous partial sequence analysis of L1 had shown this strain to be more closely related to BPV type 4, genus-specific primers were designed. Phylogenetic analysis using complete L1 ORF sequences revealed that BPV/BR-UEL2 was related to BPV types classified in the genus Xipapillomavirus and shared the highest L1 nucleotide sequence similarity with BPV type 4 (78%). This finding suggests that BPV/BR-UEL2 should be classified as a potential new type of BPV in the genus Xipapillomavirus. © 2010, Brazilian Society of Genetics.",,"Lunardi, M.;Claus, M.

Recently, the severe acute form has been associated with only a few hypervirulent strains of BVDV-2. This article reports the detection of BVDV-1b associated with an acute and fatal outbreak of BVD in a Brazilian beef cattle herd. Depression, anorexia, watery diarrhea, drooling, and weakness were observed in six steers. One of these animals was evaluated for laboratory, clinical and pathological changes. Laboratory findings were not specific; Clinically, the animal was weak, with dehydration and erosive mouth lesions. Pathological alterations in the tongue, esophagus and rumen predominated. An RT-PCR assay was performed with primers to partially amplify the 5” untranslated region (5”UTR) of the BVDV genome and BVDV was identified in all clinical samples tested. Phylogenetic analysis of lymph node-derived BVDV revealed that this strain was grouped within BVDV subtype 1b.

We show how PCR-amplified and indexed target libraries are degraded, subsampled, and stopped at time intervals to achieve pools of different average lengths, each of which is indexed with a new tag. Through this process, indices of sample origin, molecular origin and degree of degradation are incorporated to achieve a nested hierarchical structure, which will then be used in data processing to order the readings in a distance greater than that originally allowed by the system. of sequencing.

Recently, PR outbreaks occurred in a large number of herds vaccinated with Bartha-K61 in many regions of China. Here, we isolated a PRV variant, designated the TJ strain, from a Bartha-K61 vaccinated pig farm in China, evaluated the pathogenicity of the TJ strain in susceptible animals, and analyzed its complete genome sequence obtained by 454 pyrosequencing. The vaccination challenge experiment in sheep showed that the classic Bartha-K61 vaccine could not provide complete protection against challenge with the PRV TJ strain. In mice, the 50% lethal dose (LD<inf>50</inf>) of the TJ strain (10<sup>2.3</sup> TCID<inf>50</inf>) was lower than the of the classical strain PRV SC strain (10<sup>3.0</sup> TCID<inf>50</inf>). Furthermore, the TJ strain showed higher mortality for pigs, compared to the SC strain. The genome of the PRV TJ strain was determined to be 143,642 bp in length and encode 67 open reading frames. The TJ strain was grouped into an independent branch together with some recent PRV isolates from China in the phylogenetic tree, which was relatively distant from previous PRV isolates. The TJ strain showed unique variations in viral proteins that play key roles in the viral replication cycle. Taken together, the TJ strain is a highly pathogenic PRV variant with unique molecular signatures.

To better understand the genetic basis for the modified pathogenic characteristics and increased virulence, we sequenced the genomes of six novel GaHV-2 strains (LCC, LTS, WC/1203, JL/1404, CC/1409, and HS/1412). isolated from chickens with failed immunization, as well as a previously isolated GaHV-2 Chinese strain, J-1. Based on a multiple sequence alignment, several characteristic point mutations were detected in the open reading frames of the Chinese isolates. Furthermore, two deletions and one insertion were identified at the unique junctions of the short region and the terminal short repeat region in Chinese isolates, and the insertion was a characteristic of the new Chinese isolates. According to a phylogenetic analysis, the GaHV-2 genome diverged substantially during the last two decades in China. Based on the internal long repeat region, the new isolates were closely related to very virulent or very virulent plus strains.

1277,Gene expression analysis of FMD virus-infected porcine whole blood cells using high-throughput sequencing technology,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a single-stranded positive RNA virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family. The foot-and-mouth disease virus infects cloven-hoofed animals such as pigs, sheep, goats, cattle, and various species of wildlife, and remains a major threat to the livestock industry worldwide. In this study, transcriptomic analysis of whole blood from FMD virus-infected pigs was performed using the paired-end Illumina sequencing technique to understand the interactions between the pathogen and its host cells. During infection with FMD virus, a total of 120 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 110 upregulated genes and 10 downregulated genes. To further investigate DEGs involved in virus-host interactions, gene ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment were carried out. The GO annotation indicated that several DEGs were enriched in categories involved in host-virus interactions, such as stimulus response, immune system process, and biological process regulation. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that DEGs were primarily involved in the ribosome signaling pathway and immune-related signaling pathways. Ten DEGs, including the immunity-related genes BTK1, C1QB, TIMD4, and CXCL10, were selected and validated by quantitative PCR, which showed that the expression patterns of these genes are consistent with the results of in silico expression analysis. In conclusion, this study presents the first transcriptomic analysis of FMD virus-infected pig whole blood cells, and the results obtained in this study improve our understanding of the interactions between FMD virus and host cells. , as well as the diagnosis and control of foot-and-mouth disease.",,"Lv, J.;Ding, Y.;Liu, X.;Pan, L.;Zhang, Z.;Zhou, P.;Zhang, Y.;Hu, Y.",2018.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0200081,0

About 90 viruses were isolated, including 24 new to science. Newly recognized infections of vertebrates, including humans, have been described. Many unusual epidemic situations were analyzed. Permanent efforts were established to prevent bioterrorist activities and their consequences. Extensive epidemic outbreaks of West Nile fever (WNF; ie, fever caused by West Nile virus) and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) with unusually high mortality occurred in the last four years in southern Russia. We determined infection rates in humans, domestic and wild animals, mosquitoes, and ticks from natural and synanthropic biocenoses [Editorial note: ""synanthropic"" means, roughly, all species that live with (cf. lice, fleas) or near people, as in houses (cf. house mice), parks (cf. Rattus spp.), and the like, more like ""peridomestic"", but not strictly; ""biocenosis"" is the biome, the ""totality of living populations in a particular habitat, which itself is only a part of the ecosystem.""]. CCHF virus strains were phylogenetically similar to strains isolated in this area 35 years ago, but different from strains from South-Central Asia and Africa. Before the beginning of the current emergence of epidemic WNF, three genetic variants of this virus had been isolated in the USSR, two African and one Indian. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences of epidemic strains showed considerable similarity with strains from the USA and Israel and differences with strains isolated in the same areas of the USSR 20-30 years earlier. In addition to the genotype 1 strains, second and third lineage strains and a fourth genetic variant strain were isolated. The nucleotide differences of these strains from the three genotypes were around 30%. The emerging situation of WNF in Russia during the last 4 years has probably been the result not only of natural and social factors, but also of the introduction of more virulent strains or the evolution of the virus.",,"Lvov, D.

A total of 146 ticks were examined by virological methods. Mosquitoes were collected from rice fields in the Naryn River valley, 650 M above sea level (41°N, 72°E). A total of 20,000 mosquitoes of the two species were examined by virological methods. Virus isolation attempts were made in 1-2 day old suckling white mice. Antigens were prepared from the brains of diseased suckling mice by the sucrose and acetone method. Immune ascitic fluids (IAF) were prepared. The serological identification of the isolates was performed in complement fixation tests (CFT) by a macro method with a set of 57 IAF for arboviruses. Since all isolates were found to be serologically identical, the prototype strain LEIV 306 K could be studied in detail. An examination of the virus antigen in the CF tests revealed that it did not react with any of the LAIs used.

1284,Identification and phylogenetic analysis of the Coxsackie B5 virus that caused an outbreak of viral encephalitis in the Henan area.,"Objective: To identify the pathogen that caused an outbreak of viral encephalitis in the Henan area in 2011. A phylogenetic analysis of Coxsackievirus B5 (CVB5) that was isolated during this outbreak was performed. Methods: Five throat swab, 21 stool, and 14 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from 29 patients hospitalized during this outbreak. Viral isolation and real-time RT-PCR were then performed for all samples. Viral nucleic acids from enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackievirus A 16 (CA16), and pan-enterovirus (PE) were detected by real-time RT-PCR. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on complete VP1 sequences among CVB5 isolates from 2 stool and 3 CSF samples from 5 hospitalized patients and other published data retrieved from GenBank. Results: Real-time RT-PCR results showed that PE nucleic acid positive rates of throat swab, stool, and CSF samples were 60.0% (3/5), 61.9% (13 /21) and 85.7% (12/14), respectively. . All of these samples were negative for EV71 and CA16. Isolation rates for throat swab, stool, and CSF samples were 20.0% (1/5), 25.0% (5/21), and 29.0% (4/14), respectively. BLAST with VP1 and 5'-UTR sequences and molecular typing indicated that CVB5 was the main pathogen. Analysis among the 5 positive isolates based on the complete VP1 sequences showed 97.9% - 99.5% homology. Data from homologous comparisons indicated that these isolates had the highest acid nucleotide identity to the Changchun strain CVB5 CC10/10/Changchun (97.1% - 98.1%) that caused the outbreak of hand, foot, and mouth disease.

It is caused by the bluetongue virus (BTV), a double-stranded RNA virus (ds) that is classified within the genus Orbivirus, family Reoviridae. There are at least twenty-four BTV serotypes worldwide, five of which (1, 2, 4, 9 and 16) have been recently identified in Europe. BTV infects ruminants and its distribution in temperate and tropical regions of the world depends on the activity and abundance of certain vector-competent Culicoides mosquito species. The outer capsid protein VP2 of BTV is an important protective antigen and the main determinant of the virus serotype. For the first time, the authors completed sequence analysis of the complete VP2 genes of the reference strains of each of the 24 BTV serotypes and deduced their amino acid sequences. Multiple alignment of VP2 gene (protein) sequences revealed that the level of nucleotide (amino acid) sequence variation between serotypes ranged from 29% (23%) to 59% (73%), confirming that segment 2/VP2 is the most variable BTV gene/protein. Phylogenetic analysis of VP2 grouped BTV types known to be serologically cross-reactive. Low intertype identity was demonstrated for specific regions within the VP2 amino acid sequences that have been shown to be antigenic and play a role in virus neutralization.

The virus exists as 24 distinct serotypes, which are currently identified by virus isolation and serum neutralization assays. The more variable outer capsid protein VP2 (encoded by genome segment 2) is the main determinant of the BTV serotype. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, based on segment 2 amplification, have been developed for the identification of the five European types of BTV (BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-4 , BTV-9 and BTV- sixteen). Primer pairs were designed that are specific for each serotype of BTV. The resulting RT-PCR assay was sensitive and specific, providing BTV typing within 24 h. Perfect agreement was recorded between RT-PCR and virus neutralization assays. Primers for each serotype were able to successfully amplify BTV isolates of that serotype from different regions and did not show cross-amplification of the more closely related BTV serotypes. RT-PCR primers were also developed for the discrimination of vaccine and field strains of BTV serotypes currently circulating in Europe. Primer pairs that could amplify field and vaccine strains of BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-4, and BTV-9 were validated with several isolates of each serotype from various geographic origins around the world and their type-specificity it was tested again with the most closely related serotypes.

Selection to increase genetic resistance to MD is a control strategy that can augment vaccine control measures. To identify high-confidence candidate MD resistance genes, we performed a genome-wide screen for allele-specific expression (ASE) among the F(1) progeny of two inbred chicken lines that differ substantially in MD resistance. High-throughput sequencing was initially used to profile transcriptomes from pools of infected and uninfected individuals at 4 days post-infection to identify any genes that displayed ASE in response to MDV infection. RNA sequencing identified 22,655 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 5,360 in 3,773 genes exhibited significant allele imbalance. Illumina GoldenGate assays were subsequently used to quantify controlled regulatory variation in the gene (cis) and elsewhere in the genome (trans) by examining differences in expression between F(1) individuals and groups of F( 1) artificial over six time periods on 1536 of the most significant SNPs identified by RNA sequencing. Allelic disequilibrium as a result of cis-regulatory changes was confirmed in 861 of 1233 GoldenGate assays successfully examined. Furthermore, we have identified seven genes that show trans regulation only in infected animals and ~500 SNPs that show a complex interplay between cis and trans regulatory changes. Our results indicate that ASE analyzes are a powerful approach to identify regulatory variation responsible for differences in transcript abundance in genes underlying complex traits. And genes with SNPs exhibiting ASEs provide a strong foundation for further investigation of causal polymorphisms and genetic mechanisms of MD resistance. Finally, the methods used here to identify specific genes and SNPs have practical implications for applying marker-assisted selection to complex traits that are difficult to measure in agricultural species, when differences in expression are expected to control a part of the phenotypic variation.",,"Maceachern, S.;Muir, W.

The causative agent, bluetongue virus (BTV), is transmitted throughout temperate and tropical regions of the world by biting Culicoides mosquitoes. Control of BTV infection is complicated by the plurality of virus serotypes and the ubiquity and opportunistic feeding behavior of its mosquito vector. The global distribution of BTV infection has recently changed, perhaps due in part to climatic influences on the mosquito species residing in different regions. The objective of this review is to assess realistic strategies that could be used to control or prevent future outbreaks of BT and other Culicoides-borne diseases. Importantly, optimal control of rapidly evolving and emerging arboviral diseases such as BT will require integrated countermeasures that mitigate all aspects of the virus transmission cycle.

RNA Tumor viruses have historically been classified into two groups, acute transforming RNA tumor viruses and non-acute RNA tumor viruses. Acute transforming RNA tumor viruses are essentially replication defective and rapidly induce tumors by expressing viral oncogenes captured from the cellular genome in host cells. The first oncogene derived from Rous sarcoma virus was the non-receptor tyrosine kinase src, which has been identified as playing important roles in signal transduction. On the other hand, non-acute RNA tumor viruses, which consist only of gag, pro, pol, and env regions but do not carry oncogenes, are replication-competent and could activate cellular proto-oncogenes by inserting the viral long terminal repeat close to proto-oncogenes to induce tumors with a long incubation period, which is called promoter insertion. These molecular mechanisms have been thought to induce tumors. However, very recently several reports have described that the retroviral structural protein Envelope could directly induce tumors in vivo and transform cells in vitro. These are very rare examples of native retroviral structural proteins with transforming potential. In this review, we review the history of oncogenic retrovirus research and summarize recent progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of oncogenic transformation by retrovirus envelope proteins.",,"Maeda, N.;Yoshikai, Y.",2007.0,,10.2222/jsv.57.159,0

The causative agent of foot-and-mouth disease was thus the first vertebrate virus to be discovered, shortly after the discovery of plant tobacco mosaic virus. It was not until 1920 that Waldmann and Pape established a convenient animal model for the study of foot-and-mouth disease virus, using guinea pigs, and with the subsequent development of in vitro cell culture systems for the virus, the chemical and physical properties of foot-and-mouth disease. foot and mouth Viruses were elucidated during the rest of the 20th century, culminating in 1989 with a complete description of the three-dimensional structure of the virion. Foot-and-mouth disease virus is classified as a species of the genus Aphthovirus of the family Picornaviridae.

1297,"Detection and phylogenetic characterization of Columbid circovirus in Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari province, Iran","The Circovirus genus of viruses belongs to the Circoviridae family and contains virus species with circular single-stranded DNA genomes. The viruses are known to infect vertebrate species, including pigs, dogs, pigeons, and ducks. In this study, nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied to investigate the prevalence of circovirus in pigeons in Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari province, Iran. A total of 50 fecal samples underwent nucleic acid extraction, PCR amplification, and DNA sequencing. Nested PCR primers were designed to amplify a 508 base pair segment of the pigeon circovirus (PiCV) capsid gene. Of the 50 fecal samples examined, 12 (24%) produced the expected DNA amplicons with identical DNA sequences. Phylogenetic analysis has grouped the viruses with those classified as group A circoviruses. The viruses were closely related to PiCVs found in Poland, Northern Ireland, the United States, Nigeria, and Hungary.

1298,Detection and phylogenetic analysis of porcine deltacoronavirus from Guangdong province in southern China,"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a recently discovered coronavirus that causes diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration in lactating and lactating piglets. It was first reported in Hong Kong in 2012 and has since been discovered in the United States, Canada, South Korea, mainland China, Thailand, and Laos. PDCoV has been experimentally shown to cause diarrhea in pigs and was detected positive in pigs in Guangdong, southern China. In our study, 252 fecal and intestinal samples from suckling piglets and sows with diarrhea were examined for common enteric viruses. We found a prevalence of PDCoV (21.8%), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (65.5%), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (0%), group A rotavirus (25.0%) and porcine kobuvirus (68, 7%). We isolated 13 PDCoV strains and found that PDCoV infections were often co-infections with kobuvirus rather than the commonly related porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the S gene and N gene revealed that 11 of the 13 PDCoV strains belonged to the Chinese lineage. As for the two strains on the left, a single strain (CHN-GD16-05) belonged to the American and Korean lineages, while another strain (CHN-GD16-03) was similar to a Thai strain, but only in the gene S.

1300,Avian Influenza Virus Review,"Influenza viruses are classified as A, B, or C based on the antigenicity of their nucleoproteins and matrix proteins. Influenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes based on the antigenicity of two of their surface proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. All avian influenza viruses are type A viruses. Although most avian influenza viruses are avirulent, viruses of a limited number of subtypes cause serious disease in birds. This difference in pathogenicity among avian influenza viruses is primarily determined by the amino acid sequence at the viral hemagglutinin cleavage site. Since 1997, there have been multiple reports of human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. The acquisition of the ability to cause human-to-human transmission of avian influenza viruses will confront the human population with an influenza pandemic crisis. Here we review the molecular basis of the pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses in humans. [References: 8]",,"Makino, A.;Kawaoka, Y.",2005.0,Dec,,0
1301,"Human microRNA profiles in response to influenza A viruses (pH1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 subtypes)","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the regulation of gene silencing and are involved in many cellular processes, including the inhibition of infected viral replication. This study investigated the expression profiles of cellular miRNAs operating in response to influenza virus in the early stage of infection, which could be useful in understanding and monitoring viral infection. A549 cells were infected with different influenza virus subtypes (pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1). After 24 h post-infection, miRNAs were extracted and then used for DNA library construction. All DNA libraries with different indexes were pooled at the same concentration, followed by high-throughput sequencing based on the MiSeq platform. miRNAs were identified and counted from sequencing data using MiSeq reporter software. MiRNA expressions were classified into upregulated and downregulated miRNAs compared to those found in uninfected cells. Mostly, each influenza A virus subtype elicited the upregulated responses in the miRNA expression profiles. Hsa-miR-101, hsa-miR-193b, hsa-miR-23b, and hsa-miR-30e* increased when infected with all three influenza A virus subtypes. Target prediction results showed that infection by virus can trigger genes in cell process, metabolic process, development process and biological regulation. This study provided information on the cellular miRNA profile in response to various influenza A virus subtypes in circulation and that have caused outbreaks in the human population. Regulated miRNAs might be involved in virus-host interaction or host defense mechanism, which needs to be investigated for effective antiviral therapeutic interventions.",,"Makkoch, J.;Poomipak, W.;Saengchoowong, S.;Khongnomnan, K.;Praianantathavorn, K.;Jinato, T.;Poovorawan, Y.;Payungporn, S.",2016.0,Feb,,0

Reverse strand transfer or conventional sequencing approaches have disadvantages in studying 18S rRNA diversity and a next generation 454 sequencing approach was investigated. The 18S rRNA gene was amplified using RLB primers coupled to 96 unique sequence identifiers (MIDs). Theileria-positive samples from African buffalo (672) and cattle (480) from southern Africa were pooled in batches of 96 and sequenced with the GS Junior 454 sequencer to produce 825,711 informative sequences. Sequences were extracted based on MID and analyzed to identify Theileria genotypes. The genotypes observed in buffalo and cattle were confirmed in the present study, while no new genotypes were discovered. The genotypes showed specific geographic distributions, most likely related to vector distributions. The host specificity of specific buffalo and cattle genotypes was confirmed and prevalence data as well as relative parasitaemia trends indicate preference for different hosts. Mixed infections are common in African buffaloes that carry more genotypes compared to cattle. Associative or exclusionary coinfection profiles were observed between genotypes that may have implications for speciation and systematics: specifically, that more Theileria species may exist in cattle and buffalo than currently recognized. Analysis of the primers used for Theileria parva diagnosis indicates that the current primer sets will not amplify new genotypes, confirming their specificity. T. parva SNP variants occurring in the hypervariable region of 18S rRNA were confirmed. A next-generation sequencing approach is helpful in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the diversity and prevalence of 18S rRNA for Theileria, allowing evaluation of 18S gene-based diagnostic and routine assays.",,"Mans, B.

Many TSE agents reside in the environment, with infection controlled by public health measures. These include the disappearance of kuru with the cessation of ritual cannibalism, the drastic reduction of epidemic bovine encephalopathy (BSE) by eliminating contaminated feed, and the absence of endemic scrapie in geographically isolated Australian sheep with susceptible PrP genotypes. While modeling of prion proteins has generated an intense focus on the common types of protein misfolding and amyloid formation in various organisms and diseases, the biological characteristics of infectious TSE agents and their recognition by the host as foreign entities it raises several fundamental new directions for fruitful research. such as: (1) unrecognized microbial agents in the environmental metagenome that can cause latent neurodegenerative disease, (2) the evolutionary social and protective roles of different amyloid proteins in various organisms, from bacteria to mammals, and (3) the formation of amyloid as a beneficial innate immune response to stress (infectious and non-infectious).

The virus is classified into genotypes and lineages with different epidemiological relevance. Two lineages of the GI genotype (11 and 16) have been circulating widely for decades in South America. GI-11 is a lineage exclusive to South America, while the GI-16 lineage is distributed in Asia, Europe, and South America. Here, we obtained the complete genome of two Uruguayan strains from the GI-11 and GI-16 lineages using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The strains sequenced here are the first obtained in South America for infectious bronchitis virus and provide new insights into the origin, spread, and evolution of viral variants. The complete genome of strains GI-11 and GI-16 has 27,621 and 27,638 nucleotides, respectively, and has the same genomic organization. Phylogenetic inconsistency analysis reveals that both strains have a mosaic genome that arose by recombination between Eurasian strains of the GI-16 lineage and ancestral South American GI-11 viruses. Recombination occurred in South America and produced two viral variants that retained the full S1 sequences of the parental lineages but are extremely similar in the rest of their genomes.

Using bovine digital dermatitis (DD) as a disease model, we present a novel strategy to study the pathogenesis of complex infections. RESULTS: The strategy combines meta-transcriptomics with high-density peptide microarray technology to detect in vivo expressed microbial genes and host antibody response at the site of infection. Bacterial expression patterns supported the assumption that treponemes were the main DD pathogens, but also indicated the active involvement of other phyla (mainly Bacteroidetes). Bacterial genes involved in chemotaxis, flagella synthesis, and protection against oxidative and acid stress are among the main factors that define the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The extraordinary diversity observed in bacterial expression, antigens, and host antibody responses among individual cows pointed toward microbial variability as a hallmark of DD. Persistence of DD infection and reinfection in the same individual is common; therefore, high microbial diversity may undermine the host's ability to mount an efficient immune response and maintain immunological memory toward DD. The common antigenic markers identified here using high-density peptide microarray address this issue and may be useful for future preventive measures against DD.",,"Marcatili, P.;Nielsen, M.

To characterize viruses that evade the protection provided by vaccination, field isolates of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) obtained from vaccinated flocks that have repeatedly experienced IBDV outbreak episodes were analyzed from bursal samples by transcription. reverse coupled with polymerase chain reaction and dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the VP2 Hypervariable Region. Although sequence data was obtained from samples collected from three distinct flocks over a 3-year period, only limited sequence variation was observed. The few nucleotide changes were silent and the deduced amino acid sequences were identical. Thus, the predominant virus population in the field appears to represent a homogeneous antigenic group. Compared to the VP2 sequences of several IBDV strains, this predominant set was found to be closely related to the highly virulent (vv) IBDV viruses described in Europe and Asia. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the precursor polyprotein coding sequence of a representative Tunisian isolate further confirmed its assignment to the genotype vv.

1319,When African Swine Fever Plays Home - Description of an Outbreak in Namibia,"Introduction: African swine fever (ASF) is considered the most serious threat to the health of the global swine industry and is caused by a complex linear double-stranded DNA virus (ASF virus, ASFV), currently classified as the only member of the Asfarviridae family. . Objective - To describe an outbreak of African swine fever that occurred in Namibia and was managed during the international cooperation carried out by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e Molise ""G. Caporale"" (Teramo, Italy). Materials and methods - The ASF outbreak occurred in Omaruru district (Namibia) and affected a small herd of about 100 pigs. The herd was part of a game farm and was in close proximity to a small slaughterhouse, where wild boars had recently been slaughtered. Clinical signs appear suddenly and affect pigs of different age classes. Necropsy of two pigs was performed for diagnostic purposes: histopathology, direct immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction. Results - At necropsy, all pigs investigated showed generalized hemorrhagic lesions. Microscopically, mainly recent hemorrhages were observed, along with severe lymphocytolysis in all lymphoid tissues. Laboratory investigations confirmed the diagnosis of ASF. The outbreak was eventually resolved by stamping out. Discussion - In Africa, ASFV infection strictly depends on the ""sylvatic cycle"", which involves wild boars and ticks of the Ornithodoros moubata complex. Transmission mechanisms from wildlife and domestic pigs are still unclear, but ticks most likely play a key role. Therefore, the ASF outbreak described here could represent the prototype for ASF in southern Africa. In that region, the eradication of the African swine fever virus seems unattainable and the control of African swine fever must focus on biosecurity measures. As in this report, ASF generally occurs with very high morbidity and mortality, at least in previously unexposed pigs. In contrast, subclinical and chronic infections are more common in endemic areas. Pathological findings are very useful for diagnosing and counteracting ASF. A number of hemorrhagic diseases must be considered in the differential diagnoses. The anamnestic and epidemiological data are of great help to correctly address the diagnostic process. Conclusions: The recent outbreak in Eastern Europe further confirms that African swine fever is a serious transboundary disease, still negatively affecting the pig industry worldwide. The epidemiological and pathological characteristics described in this document are of diagnostic value and of relevance to quickly counteract the spread and economic impact of the disease.",,"Marruchella, G.;Maseke, M.;Scacchia, M.",2014.0,Dec,,0
1320,Phylogenetic analysis of Sudanese rabies viruses provides evidence for a viral clade with a unique molecular signature,"Rabies is endemic in Sudan and remains a constant threat to public health, as transmission to humans occurs primarily through dogs. In addition, large-scale livestock losses occur each year, causing economic and social dilemmas. In this study, we analyzed a cohort of 143 rabies viruses circulating in Sudan collected from 10 different animal species between 1992 and 2006. Partial nucleoprotein sequence data (400 bp) were obtained and compared with available sequence data from the classical African rabies virus (RABV). isolates. The Sudanese sequences formed a discrete cluster within the Africa 1a cluster, which includes a small number of sequences that clustered with Ethiopian RABV sequences. These latter sequences share an aspartic acid at position 106 (Asp106) with all other members of the Africa 1a group, in contrast to the remaining Sudanese strains, which code for glutamic acid at this position (Glu106).

Group A rotaviruses (GARV) account for up to 1 million child deaths each year, mostly in developing countries, and human vaccines are now available in many countries. Rotavirus-associated enteritis is a major problem in cattle, especially young calves and piglets. Early in epidemiological studies of GARV in humans, sporadic cases or epidemics due to atypical animal-like GARV strains were described. Whole genome sequencing of human and animal GARV strains has revealed striking genetic heterogeneity in the 11 double-stranded RNA segments in different rotavirus strains and has provided evidence for frequent intersections between the evolution of human and animal rotaviruses. as a result of multiple repeated events. of interspecies transmission and subsequent adaptation. © 2009 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Martella, V.;BÃ¡nyai, K.;Matthijnssens, J.;Buonavoglia, C.;Ciarlet, M.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.08.028,0
1322,Enteric viral infections in lambs or kids,"Diarrhea in lambs and kids is usually a complex and multifactorial syndrome. Common infectious causes of diarrhea in lambs and kids during the first month of life are bacterial or parasitic in nature. However, despite appreciable improvements in management practices and prevention and treatment strategies over the last few decades, diarrhea remains a common and costly syndrome affecting newborn small ruminants. Recent advances in diagnostic and metagenomic investigations of the enteric environment have led to the discovery of a number of new viruses, although their pathobiological properties remain largely unknown. Further evaluating the impact of these viruses on the health and production of these livestock animals is necessary and requires the development of accurate diagnostic tools and the updating of diagnostic algorithms for enteric pathological conditions.",,"Martella, V.;Decaro, N.;Buonavoglia, C.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.08.006,0

1327,Pestivirus infections at the interface between wild and domestic ruminants in the Southern French Alps,"In alpine pastures, interspecies transmission has recently been incriminated in the epidemiology of pestivirus infection. The aim of this study was to investigate pestivirus infections in wild and domestic ruminants sharing pastures in the Southern Alps of France. Animal sera were screened for pestivirus antibodies against the pestivirus NS3 protein by a commercial blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All 38 domestic herds tested were positive for pestivirus-specific antibodies. Individual seroprevalence reached 76.5% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: [74.2-78.8%]) of the 1,383 sheep tested. For wild ruminants, 38.7% (95% CI: [33.8-43.9%]) of the 369 chamois analyzed, 28.7% (95% CI: [17.4-38.1 %]) of the 72 roe deer and 22.2% (95% CI: [6.5-37.9%]) of the 27 mouflons were seropositive. Virus detection was carried out in spleen samples from hunted wild animals (.n = .160) and from 15 domestic ruminants (clinically suspected to be persistently infected animals), by conventional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. (RT-PCR). Three pestivirus strains were isolated from RT-PCR positive sheep samples. Viruses were classified into BDV-3, BDV-Tunisian, and BDV-6 genotypes. For the first time, a strain (strain RUPI-05) was isolated from an alpine chamois and grouped into the BDV-6 genotype, showing 92% identity in the 5'-UTR region with the sheep isolate from the same area. Thus, an active circulation of pestiviruses was demonstrated in both wild and domestic ungulates of the southern French Alps. The results suggest that cross-species transmission is likely to occur between sheep and chamois.",,"Martin, C.;Duquesne, V.;Adam, G.;Belleau, E.;Gauthier, D.;Champion, J.

1328,Recombination in eukaryotic single-stranded DNA viruses,"Although single-stranded DNA (ss) viruses that infect humans and their domestic animals do not generally cause significant disease, arthropod-borne plant ssDNA viruses do and, as a result, seriously limit food production in most of the temperate regions of the world. In addition to the well-known ssDNA viruses that infect plants and animals, it has recently become apparent through metagenomic studies of ssDNA molecules that a large number of other diverse ssDNA viruses also exist in almost all terrestrial and aquatic environments. The host ranges of these viruses probably span the tree of life and they are likely to be important components of global ecosystems. Several lines of evidence suggest that a fundamental evolutionary process during the generation of this global diversity of ssDNA viruses has likely been genetic recombination. High rates of homologous recombination, non-homologous recombination, and genome component rearrangement are known to occur within and between several different species of ssDNA viruses and here we discuss the diverse roles that these different types of recombination can play, both in day-to-day biology. daily and, in the long term, the evolution of these viruses. We focus specifically on the ecological, biochemical, and selective factors that underlie detectable genetic exchange patterns among ssDNA viruses and discuss how all of these should be considered when assessing the adaptive value of recombination during ssDNA virus evolution. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Martin, D.

A case study,"Objective: A case of severe acute clinical disease is described after a BVDV-2 infection that caused great economic losses in a dairy herd and the course of the infection was followed. Material and methods: The affected herd consisted of 25 Deutsch Fleckvieh cows and their offspring. The farm was BHV-1 free and annual milk production averaged 6500 kg. Disease cases and clinical findings were collected and analyzed from September 2002 to April 2003. Antibody testing against BVDV was performed with indirect antibody ELISA. BVDV antigens were detected by antigen-ELISA and immunofluorescence flow cytometry. The isolated viruses were classified as BVDV-2 using monoclonal antibodies and PCR. Results: Six cows and one heifer developed hemorrhagic enteritis. Two of these cows were euthanized and one cow died in the course of the disease. Six cows aborted or gave birth prematurely. In addition, four calves died and three calves, which were born weak or suffered from profuse diarrhea, were euthanized. Two calves remained persistently infected. An infection of the herd with BVDV-2 was diagnosed as the cause of the disease. Conclusion and clinical relevance: The results indicate that the herd had not received BVDV-2 prior to infection. The virus must have circulated in the herd for some time, even without the presence of persistently infected animals.",,"Martin, R.;Kuhne, S.;Mansfeld, R.",2005.0,,,0

In Cuba, the presence of BCoV was first reported in 2006. Since then, sporadic outbreaks have continued to occur. This study aimed to deepen the knowledge of the evolution, molecular markers of virulence and epidemiology of BCoV in Cuba. A total of 30 samples collected between 2009 and 2011 were used for PCR amplification and direct sequencing of the partial or complete S gene. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic studies were performed using partial or complete sequences of the S gene as phylogenetic markers. All Cuban bovine coronavirus sequences were placed in a single group supported by bootstrap probability values of 100% and posterior probability of 1.00. Cuban bovine coronavirus sequences also clustered with US BCoV strains corresponding to GenBank accession numbers EF424621 and EF424623, suggesting a common origin for these viruses.

1332,Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus isolates differ in their susceptibility to neutralization,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is highly heterogeneous. This heterogeneity has an effect on the antigenic composition of PRRSV and could create differences in sensitivity to neutralization between isolates. Sensitivity to neutralization could be an important characteristic of PRRSV isolates because isolates resistant to neutralization are likely to represent a major challenge for the development of vaccines that elicit broad protective immunity. However, little information is available to understand or categorize the viral neutralization phenotype of PRRSV isolates. Consequently, the main objective of this study was to determine whether PRRSV isolates differ in their susceptibility to neutralization and whether they can be classified into different categories based on their neutralization phenotype. For this, a panel of 39 PRRSV isolates and a set of 30 hyperimmune monospecific sera were used in cross-neutralization assays. The results of this study indicate that PRRSV isolates differ in their sensitivity to neutralization and the k-means grouping system allowed isolates to be classified into four different categories according to their neutralization phenotype: highly sensitive, sensitive, moderately sensitive and resistant to PRRSV. the neutralization. Subsequent analyzes using two additional grouping systems that considered individual data for the classification of the isolates confirmed that the classification obtained by k-means is accurate in most cases and that only in a few cases is the classification less strict. The sequences of GP3, GP4 and GP5 were analyzed but no correlation could be found between the sequence of the previously identified neutralizing epitopes or the number of N-linked glycosylation sites in different proteins and the neutralizing phenotype of the isolates. These data provide the first systematic evaluation of the overall neutralization sensitivities of a panel of various PRRSV isolates. Isolate classification provides a useful tool to facilitate the systematic characterization of neutralizing antibody production elicited by novel vaccine candidates. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"MartÃ­nez-Lobo, F.

1338,Viral metagenomics demonstrates that domestic pigs are a potential reservoir of Ndumu virus,"Background: The increasing demand for pork has resulted in a massive expansion of pig production in Uganda. This has resulted in increased contact between humans and pigs. Pigs can act as reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Therefore, the identification of potential zoonotic pathogens is important for public health surveillance. In this study, during routine general surveillance for African swine fever, the presence of RNA and DNA viruses in Ugandan domestic pigs was examined using a high-throughput pyrosequencing method. Recommendations. Serum samples were collected from 16 domestic pigs from five regions of Uganda and pooled accordingly. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and sequenced on the 454 GS-FLX platform. Among the sequences assigned to a taxon, 53% corresponded to the domestic pig (Sus scrofa). African swine fever virus, Torque teno viruses (TTV), and porcine endogenous retroviruses were identified. Interestingly, two pools (B and C) of RNA origin had sequences showing 98% sequence identity to Ndumu virus (NDUV). None of the reads had identity with the Insecta class, indicating that these sequences were unlikely to result from contamination with mosquito nucleic acids. Conclusions: This is the first report of the domestic pig as a vertebrate host of the Ndumu virus. NDUV had previously been isolated only from culicine mosquitoes. Therefore, NDUV represents a potential zoonotic pathogen, particularly given the increasing risk of contact between humans, livestock, and mosquitoes. © 2012 Masembe et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Masembe, C.;Michuki, G.;Onyango, M.;Rumberia, C.;Norling, M.;Bishop, R.

The antigenic relationship between SPV and vaccinia was also analyzed by immunoprecipitations and revealed little or no cross-reactivity. The growth characteristics of SPV in tissue culture were examined by light microscopy and revealed a delayed cytopathology different from that of vaccinia virus. SPV causes foci in pig kidney cells that are not evident until at least 4 days after infection, whereas vaccinia rapidly generates plaques in these cells. The kinetics of SPV DNA accumulation, protein expression, and RNA transcription have been examined and indicate that each of these facets of the SPV growth cycle is also markedly delayed compared to vaccinia virus.

Here, we report the identification of a new group A bovine rotavirus from diarrhea of adult cattle. A group A rotavirus was detected from an epizootic outbreak of diarrhea in adult cows with decreased milk production in Japan in 2013. Whole genome analyzes of fecal samples by viral metagenomics using a next-generation sequencer revealed that it had a combination of genotypes not reported G15P[14].

The animals were established by integrating the EG10 lambda phage DNA as a transgene into the genome. The inserted position of the transgene on the chromosome was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis; however, the exact position and sequence of the inserted junction was unknown. To identify the site and pattern of genomic integration of transgene copies, genomic DNAs extracted from C57BL/6J gpt delta mice and F344 gpt delta rats were applied to whole genome sequencing and pairwise analysis. Results: The result confirmed that the multicopy EG10 lambda transgenes insert at a single position on mouse chromosome 17. The junction contains 70 bp of overlapping genomic sequences and has short homology at both ends. A copy number analysis suggested that the inserted transgenes may contain 41 head-to-tail junctions and 16 junctions of other types, such as rearranged abnormal junctions. He suggested that the number of intact copies might be about 40 at most. In F344 gpt delta rats, the transgenes insert at a single position on chromosome 4 of the rat. The junction does not contain an overlapping sequence, but a 72 kb genomic sequence that included a gene was deleted. The inserted transgenes may contain 15 head-to-tail junctions and two rearranged junctions. He suggested that the number of intact copies could be 14 at most.

1343,"A new sequence of duck circovirus, detected in melanitta fusca, supports a great diversity among this species of virus","Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of circovirus in wild bird populations in Poland. Circoviruses possess immunosuppressive properties and can interfere with the health of wild birds. Method: 83 birds, belonging to 23 species, were analyzed with wide-range nested PCR. The obtained PCR products were sequenced and new primers were designed to analyze the entire viral genome. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to find any relationship to known circoviruses. Results: The DNA sequence of the circovirus was found in 4 birds. All samples came from the velvet scoter (Melanitta fusca), a sea duck of the subfamily Merginae. Birds that tested positive for the circovirus were found dead in fishing nets off the Baltic coast. During post-mortem examination, the carcasses of two of the scoters showed only slight emaciation, while the other two birds appeared healthy. The obtained full length circovirus sequence revealed 1988 nucleotides and the presence of typical features (ie Cap, Rep and ORF3). The nucleotide similarity to other duck circoviruses was 84-86%. Genome-wide and cap gene phylogenetic analysis indicated that the new circovirus is related to known duck circoviruses, especially to subtypes sometimes referred to as duck circovirus genotype 1, but not genotype 2. Conclusions: In this study, we have reported a new sequence of duck circovirus detected in the velvet duck, a species of sea duck. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of the new virus sequence support previous reports that duck circovirus (DuCV) is a species with a high degree of diversity. The viral sequence obtained from the velvet scoter suggests that DuCV can infect birds of the subfamily Anatinae.

A comprehensive study of the humoral immune response of five vaccinated horses to AHSV-4 antigenic peptides was carried out. A fragmented genome phage display library expressing a genome-wide repertoire of AHSV-4 peptides was constructed. The library was affinity screened for binders on immobilized polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) isolated from horse sera collected before and after immunization with a monovalent attenuated AHSV-4 vaccine. The DNA inserts of the binding phage were sequenced with Illumina high throughput sequencing. Data was normalized using IgG-selected preimmune sequences. More sequences were assigned to the genes encoding NS3, VP6 and VP5 than to the other genes. However, VP2 and VP5 each had more antigenic regions than each of the other proteins. This study identified a number of epitopes to which the horse's humoral immune system responds during immunization with AHSV-4.",,"Mathebula, E. M.;Faber, F.

1345,Human parvovirus 4 'PARV4' remains elusive despite a decade of study,"Human parvovirus 4 ('PARV4') is a small DNA tetraparvovirus, first reported in 2005. In some populations, PARV4 infection is uncommon and evidence of exposure is only found in people with risk factors for parenteral infection. who are infected with other blood viruses. transmitted viruses. In other settings, seroprevalence studies suggest an age-associated endemic pattern of transmission, independent of any specific risk factors. The clinical impact of PARV4 infection remains uncertain, but reported disease associations include influenza-like syndrome, encephalitis, accelerated HIV disease, and hydrops fetalis. In this review, we set out to report progress updates of the recent literature, focusing on cohort research in different geographic settings, now including information from Asia, the Middle East, and South America, and discussing whether attributes of viral populations or of the guest. underpin the striking differences in epidemiology. We review progress in understanding viral phylogeny and biology, approaches to diagnosis, and insights that can be gained from studies of closely related animal pathogens. Crucial questions about pathogenicity remain unanswered, but we highlight new evidence supporting a possible link between PARV4 and an encephalitis syndrome. Unequivocal evidence that PARV4 is endemic in certain populations should fuel ongoing research efforts to understand risk factors and transmission routes and gain new insights into the impact of this virus on human health.",,"Matthews, P.

1346,Comprehensive genome-based rotavirus classification reveals a common origin between human wa-type and porcine rotavirus strains and human DS-1-type and bovine rotavirus strains,"The classification of group A rotaviruses is currently based on the molecular properties of the two outer coat proteins, VP7 and VP4, and the middle coat protein, VP6. As the rearrangement of the 11 rotavirus gene segments plays a key role in generating rotavirus diversity in nature, a classification system based on all rotavirus gene segments is desirable to determine which genes influence rotavirus. rotavirus host range restriction, replication and virulence, as well as for the study of rotavirus epidemiology and evolution. To establish this classification system, gene sequences encoding VP1 to VP3, VP6 and NSP1 to NSP5 were determined for human and animal rotavirus strains belonging to different G and P genotypes, in addition to those available in the databases, and used to define phylogenetics. relationships between all rotavirus genes. On the basis of these phylogenetic analyses, the appropriate identity cutoff values for each gene were determined. For the VP4 gene, a nucleotide identity cutoff value of 80% fully correlated with all 27 established P genotypes. For the VP7 gene, a nucleotide identity cutoff value of 80% closely matched the established G genotypes, but identified four additional distinct genotypes composed of murine or avian rotavirus strains. Phylogenetic analyzes of the VP1 to VP3, VP6 and NSP1 to NSP5 genes showed the existence of 4, 5, 6, 11, 14, 5, 7, 11 and 6 genotypes, respectively, according to the nucleotide identity cut-off values of the 83%. , 84%, 81%, 85%, 79%, 85%, 85%, 85% and 91%, respectively. Based on these data, a revised nomenclature of rotavirus strains is proposed. The new classification system allows the identification of (i) distinct genotypes, which probably followed separate evolutionary paths; (ii) interspecies transmissions and a plethora of rearrangement events; and (iii) certain gene constellations that revealed (a) a common origin between human Wa-type rotavirus strains and porcine rotavirus strains and (b) a common origin between human DS-1-type rotavirus strains and rotaviruses. cattle.

Multiple new genotypes were identified and genotype numbers were assigned by the Rotavirus Classification Task Force: R9 (VP1), C9 (VP2), N9 (NSP2), T12 (NSP3), E14 (NSP4), and H7 and H11 (NSP5) . The genotype constellation of L338 was unique: G13-P[18]-I6-R9-C9-M6-A6-N9-T12-E14-H11. The remaining six equine RVA strains showed a largely conserved constellation of genotypes: G3/G14-P[12]-I2/I6-R2-C2-M3-A10-N2-T3-E2/E12-H7, which is highly different from other known constellations of non-equine RVA genotypes. Phylogenetic analyzes revealed that the sequences of these equine RVA strains are distantly related to non-equine RVA strains, and that there are at least three lineages within equine RVA strains. A small number of rearrangement events were observed. Interestingly, the three RVA strains from Argentina had the E12 genotype, while the three RVA strains from Ireland and South Africa had the E2 genotype. The unusual E12 genotype has so far only been described in Argentina among RVA strains collected from guanacos, cattle, and horses, suggesting a geographic isolation of this NSP4 genotype.

1350,Study of molecular evolution and epidemiological links of Newcastle disease virus isolates from 1995 to 2016 in Iran,"In the case of Newcastle disease virus, multiple factors, including host adaptation, evasion of the immune response, and selective pressures, have been suggested to result in the evolution of viruses and the appearance of genetic variants. Multiple studies on virus classification and global epidemiological links have yielded consistent data. Here, we have conducted a molecular analysis study of circulating Newcastle disease viruses in Iran (1995-2016). Based on evolutionary differences, isolates of subgenotypes VIg, VIj, VIIj, VIId, XIIIa, and XIIId have been circulating in the country for a period of 21 years. Based on data analysis, VIg isolates shared the highest sequence identity with Russian and Polish isolates of subgenotype VIg, while isolates of subgenotype VIj (2012) were most similar to a virus isolated in 2015 from India. Analysis of the evolutionary divergence of the VIIj subgenotype suggests that Chinese and Ukrainian viruses may have played a crucial role in the emergence of VIIj isolates. Studies of evolutionary differences also indicated that XIIIa isolates circulating in Iran may have caused the appearance of adapted variants of the XIIId subgenotype. Therefore, we propose that the evolutionary and epidemiological study of virulent Newcastle disease viruses could help provide precise molecular data on the variants that circulate in the region, thus aiding the design of more efficient recombinant vaccines.",,"Mayahi, V.;Esmaelizad, M.",2017.0,,10.1007/s00705-017-3536-5,0

Vaccination is used worldwide to control MD, but increasingly virulent field strains can overcome this protection, creating a need for new vaccines. Previous studies revealed that insertion of the reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) long terminal repeat (LTR) into a cloned bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) of a highly virulent strain of MDV, Md5, made the resulting recombinant virus, rMd5 REV -LTR BAC, will be completely attenuated. in chickens with positive maternal antibodies (Mab+) at passage 40. In the current study, the protective efficacy of rMd5 REV-LTR BAC was evaluated. First, passage 70 was identified to be completely attenuated in maternal antibody negative chickens and was chosen as the optimal passage level for use in protective efficacy studies. Second, three protective efficacy trials were conducted comparing the BAC rMd5 REV-LTR p70 with the CVI988/Rispens vaccine. Groups of Mab+ and Mab-15I5â€‰Ã—â€‰71 chickens were vaccinated in ovo at 18 days post-embryonation or intra-abdominally on the day of hatching, and challenged 5 days post-hatch with the strain vv+MDV 686.

1352,Sequence comparison of Salmonella typhi genome sample with Escherichia coli K-12 complete genome sequence,"Raw sequence data representing the majority of a bacterial genome can be obtained at a small fraction of the cost of a complete sequence. To demonstrate the utility of such a resource, 870 single-stranded M13 clones from a Salmonella typhi Ty2 genome shotgun library were sequenced. The sequence reads an average of more than 400 bases and sampled the genome with an average spacing of once every 5,000 bases. A total of 339,243 bases of unique sequence were generated (approximately 7% representation). The sample of 870 sequences was compared to the complete genome of Escherichia coli K-12 and to the rest of the GenBank database, which can also be considered a collection of sampled sequences. Despite the incomplete data set for S. typhi, interesting categories could easily be discerned. Sixteen percent of the determined S. typhi sequences had close homologues among known Salmonella sequences (P < 1e-40 in BlastX or BlastN), reflecting the proportion of these genomes that have been previously sequenced; 277 sequences (32%) had no apparent orthologs in the entire E. coli K-12 genome (P > 1e-20), of which 155 sequences (18%) had no close similarities to any sequence in the database (P > 1e -5). Eight of the 277 sequences had similarities to genes in other E. coli strains or plasmids, and six sequences showed evidence of new phage lysogens or sequence remnants of phage integrations, including a member of the lambda family (P < 1e- fifteen). Twenty-three sample sequences had significantly closer similarity to a sequence in the database from organisms other than the E. coli/Salmonella clade (which includes Shigella and Citrobacter). These sequences are new candidate lateral transfer events to the S. typhi lineage or deletions in the E. coli K-12 lineage. Eleven putative insertion/deletion event junctions of more than 100 bp were observed in the sample, indicating that more than 150 of these events can distinguish S. typhi from E. coli K-12.

1353,Screening Cells and Biological Reagents for Adventitious Agents Using Degenerate Primer PCR and Massively Parallel Sequencing,"We employed a massively parallel sequencing (MPS)-based approach to test model cell reagents and substrates, including Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), African green monkey kidney (Vero), and cell lines from High Five insects. for adventitious agents. RNA and DNA were extracted directly from samples or viral capsid-enriched preparations and then subjected to MPS-based non-specific virus detection with degenerate oligonucleotide primer (DOP) PCR. MPS by 454, Illumina MiSeq, and Illumina HiSeq were compared on separate samples. Virus detection using these methods was reproducibly achieved. Unsorted sequences from CHO cells represented cellular sequences that had not yet been submitted to databases commonly used for sequence identification. The sensitivity of MPS-based virus detection was consistent with theoretical limits expected based on virus dilution in cellular nucleic acids. Capsid preparation increased the number of viral sequences detected. Potential viral sequences were detected in several samples; in each case, these sequences were artificial or (depending on further studies) shown not to be associated with replication-competent viruses. Virus-like sequences were more likely to be identified in BLAST searches using virus-specific databases that did not contain cellular sequences. The viral sequences detected included previously described retrovirus and retrovirus-like sequences in CHO, Vero, MDCK and High Five cells, and endogenous nodavirus and bracovirus sequences in High Five insect cells. Bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine hokovirus, and porcine circovirus sequences were detected in some reagents. A recently described parvo-like virus present in some nucleic acid extraction resins was also identified in cells and extraction controls of some samples.

1354,Disruption of cytokine networks by poxviruses: lessons from myxoma virus,"Myxoma virus is an infectious poxvirus pathogen that induces a virulent systemic disease called myxomatosis in European rabbits. The disease is rapidly and uniformly lethal to susceptible rabbits and is characterized by widespread dysfunction of cellular immunity and multiple disruptions of the host cytokine network. Virus genes are classified as virulence factors because virus constructs containing gene targeting alterations induce attenuated disease symptoms. Many of these genes encode proteins that directly interact with effector elements of the host's immune system. Included among these immunosubversive viral proteins are secreted mimetics of host ligands or regulators (virokines) and homologues of cellular cytokine receptors (viroceptors). Five examples of these myxoma virus-encoded immunomodulatory proteins are reviewed: (1) myxoma growth factor, a member of the epidermal growth factor ligand superfamily; (2) SERF-1, a secreted serine proteinase inhibitor; (3) M11L, a receptor-like surface protein; (4) T2, a tumor necrosis factor receptor homologue; and (5) T7, an interferon-gamma receptor homologue. The origin of viral strategies designed to subvert immune regulation by host cytokines is considered in the context of myxoma virus biology within immunocompetent hosts.",,"McFadden, G.;Graham, K.;Ellison, K.;Barry, M.;Macen, J.;Schreiber, M.;Mossman, K.;Nash, P.;Lalani, A.;Everett, H.",1995.0,May,,0

These strains were compared with four strains (A, B, C and D), which had circulated 25 years earlier, by sequencing the gene encoding the S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein. Analysis of the deduced nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed that the eight New Zealand strains are genetically related and share greater than 82.8% nucleotide and 79% amino acid homology within the S1 region. Strains T6, K43 and K87 were more than 99% homologous to strains C and D previously described. A fourth new strain (K32) was more closely related to strain B described above. Phylogenetic analysis of the strains revealed that the New Zealand strains were more closely related to the Australian strains than to the European or North American ones. The New Zealand strain A shared 99.5% nucleotide and 98.7% amino acid homology with the Australian strain Vic S.

Phylogenetic analysis reveals the presence of three main geographical populations of LI virus in the British Isles, viz. Irish, Welsh, and British LI viruses, which cause encephalomyelitis in animals, predominantly sheep, and cohabit in the same tick population. British LI virus is found in Scotland, England, Ireland, and Norway. Irish and Welsh LI viruses occur only in Ireland and Wales, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis also predicts that the LI virus initially arose in Ireland and that a descendant was introduced to Great Britain via Wales and subsequently transported to the borders of Scotland, from where it spread throughout Scotland, northern England and Norway. . More recently, the British LI virus was reintroduced in Ireland and also in south-west England. Lineage divergence dates, calculated from synonym substitution rate, indicate that LI virus arose in the British Isles less than 800 years ago and that most LI virus spread occurred during the last 300 years. .

1357,Type-specific antigenicity of avian reoviruses,"The type specificity of the neutralizing activity in chicken antiserum against avian reoviruses was affected by the method of antiserum production. The neutralizing activity produced in response to virus infection was more type-specific than that produced by immunization with inactivated virus emulsified in adjuvant. Using reassortant viruses, the induction of type-specific neutralizing activity was shown to be associated with the virion protein sigma C (sigmaC). Antigenic classification of virus strains based on immunoprecipitation of sigmaC protein by chicken antiserum was attempted and the results were similar to those obtained by serum reciprocal neutralization tests. Unidirectional immunoprecipitation of sigmaC protein by antisera against some heterologous viruses, similar to that reported in reciprocal neutralization tests, made it difficult to assign individual viruses to serogroups and showed that the type specificity of sigmaC protein was not absolute. The neutralizing activity of monoclonal antibodies against the sigmaC protein of the avian reovirus strain RAM1 suggested that there were separate type- and group-specific antigenic domains in the sigmaC protein, and that the group-specific domains may be associated with antibody induction. against heterologous viruses.",,"Meanger, J.;Wickramasinghe, R.;Enriquez, C.

An analysis of the whole genome sequence revealed that the influenza D virus that was isolated in Japan formed a single cluster that was distinct from strains found in other countries.

Although infections are reported in a wide range of bird species, the pathogenicity of virulent NDV isolates of chicken origin in ducks remains elusive. In this study, two NDV strains were isolated and biologically and genetically characterized from an outbreak in apparently healthy chickens and ducks. Pathogenicity evaluation indices, including mean death time (MDT), intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI), and fusion protein (F) cleavage motifs, indicated that both isolates were velogenic in nature. Although these isolates had pathogenic characteristics, interestingly, they showed differential pathogenicity in ducks. The chicken-derived isolate caused high mortality (70%), while the duck-derived virus resulted in low mortality (20%) in 4-week-old ducks. Interestingly, both isolates showed comparable disease pathologies in chickens. Whole genome sequence analysis showed that the virus genome contains 15,192 nucleotides and exhibits features that are characteristic of velogenic strains of NDV. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that both isolates were grouped into class II and genotype VII. However, there were several mutations in functionally important regions of the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins, which may be responsible for the differential pathogenicity of these viruses in ducks. In summary, these results suggest that NDV strains with the same genotype show differential pathogenicity in chickens and ducks. Furthermore, virulent chicken-derived NDVs are more pathogenic for ducks than duck-derived viruses. These findings propose a role for chickens in the evolution of viral pathogenicity and the potential genetic resistance of ducks to poultry viruses.",,"Meng, C.;Rehman, Z.

1366,"Virome analysis of tick-borne viruses in Heilongjiang province, China","Ticks are implicated in the transmission of various human and livestock pathogens throughout the world. This study aimed to understand the geographic distribution of tick species, along with tick-associated viruses, in Heilongjiang province, northeast China. Molecular methods were used to classify tick species, with next-generation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-based analyzes to assess tick viromes from four representative sampling sites in the Greater Khingan Mountains. Five species of ixodid ticks were identified, including Ixodes persulcatus, Dermacentor nuttalli, Dermacentor silvarum, Haemaphysalis longicornis, and Haemaphysalis concinna. Of the 1,102 ticks, 3,568,561 high-quality reads were obtained by next-generation sequencing. After trimming, 302,540 reads were obtained, of which 6,577 (2.16%) reads were annotated to virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the viral sequences shared a close relationship with Orthonairovirus, Phlebovirus, deer tick Mononegavirales-like virus, and Jingmen tick virus sequences, but the importance of these recently identified tick-borne viruses for human and animal health requires more research. The results of this study provide a basis not only for future studies on the relationship between ticks and tick-borne viruses, but also for preventing future tick-borne epidemic outbreaks through vector control.",,"Meng, F.;Ding, M.;Tan, Z.;Zhao, Z.;Xu, L.;Wu, J.;He, B.;Tu, C.",2019.0,,10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.12.002,0
1367,Deep sequencing reveals significant diversity among dominant variants and evolutionary dynamics of avian leukosis viruses in two infectious ecosystems,"BACKGROUND: As a typical retrovirus, the evolution of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) in different infectious ecosystems is not characterized, what we know is that there is a cloud of diverse variants, namely quasispecies with a diversity significant genetics. This study is to explore the selection of infectious ecosystems in dominant variants and its evolutionary dynamics of ALV-J between DF1 cells and specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens. High-throughput sequencing platforms provide an approach to detect quasispecies diversity more completely. RESULTS: An average of around 20,000 valid reads were obtained from two variable regions of the gp85 gene and the LTR-U3 region from each sample in different infectious ecosystems. The top 10 dominant variants among ALV-J from chicken plasmas, DF1 cells and liver tumor were completely different from each other. There was also a difference of the Shannon entropy and global selection pressure (Ï‰) values in different infectious ecosystems. In plasmas from two chickens, a large portion of the quasispecies contained a 3-peptide ""LSD"" repeat insert that was only less than 0.01% in DF1 cell culture supernatants. In parallel studies, the LTR-U3 region of ALV-J from chicken plasmas showed more variants with mutations in its transcriptional regulatory elements than those from DF1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data taken together suggest that molecular epidemiology based on ALV-J isolated in cell culture may not represent the true evolution of the virus in chicken flocks in the field. The biological significance of the ""LSD"" insert and mutations in LTR-U3 needs to be studied further.",,"Meng, F.;Dong, X.;Hu, T.;Chang, S.;Fan, J.;Zhao, P.;Cui, Z.",2016.0,,,0
1368,Avain leukosis virus subgroup J quasispecies analysis by high-throughput sequencing and Sanger,"BACKGROUND: The J subgroup of avian leukosis viruses (ALV-J) exists as a complex mixture of different, but closely related, genomes called quasispecies subject to continuous change according to the Principles of Darwinian evolution. METHOD: The present study seeks to compare conventional Sanger sequencing with deep sequencing using the MiSeq platform to study the dynamics of ALV-J quasispecies. RESULTS: The accuracy and reproducibility of MiSeq sequencing were determined better than Sanger sequencing by running each experiment in duplicate. Consistent with the single-position mutation rate and the ability to distinguish dominant quasispecies with two sequencing methods, the conventional Sanger sequencing technique showed high randomness due to few sequencing samples, while deep sequencing could reflect the composition of the quasispecies more accurately. Meanwhile, quasispecies research via Sanger sequencing was simulated and analyzed with the help of a 1000-fold replacement resampling strategy from high-throughput sequencing data, indicating that higher titer of antibodies, higher sequence entropy, harder analysis with conventional Sanger sequencing resulted in lower proportions of dominant variants. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, deep sequencing is more suitable for detecting rare variants comprehensively. The Sanger sequencing simulation we propose here will also help standardize quasispecies research under different selection pressures based on next-generation sequencing data.",,"Meng, F.;Dong, X.;Hu, T.;Liu, Y.;Zhao, Y.;Lv, Y.;Chang, S.;Zhao, P.;Cui, Z.",2016.0,06 27,,0
1369,Characterization of subgroup J avian leukosis virus isolated from indigenous Chinese chickens,"Background: Although the purification of avian leukosis virus (ALV) from laying hens and broilers has achieved remarkable achievements, ALV infection was still severe in indigenous Chinese chickens. Methods: In order to assess the epidemic status of avian leukosis virus in indigenous chickens in China, 10 new strains of ALV subgroup J (ALV-J), named JS16JH01 to JS16JH10, were isolated and identified by virus isolation and Antibody immunofluorescence assays from a Chinese landrace farm with sporadic incidence of tumors. To better understand its virological characteristics, the proviral genome of ENV-LTR was sequenced and compared with reference strains. Results: The homology of the gp85 gene between the ten strains ALV-J and NX0101 was in the range of 89.7-94.8% at the nuclear acid level. Furthermore, their gp85 genes were quite varied, with 92-98% identities with themselves at the nuclear acid level. There were several snp and indel sites in the amino acid sequence of the gp85 genes after comparison with other reference ALV strains. Interestingly, a new insertion in the gp85 region was found in two strains, JS16JH01 and JS16JH07, compared to NX0101 and HPRS-103. Discussion: At present, due to the large-scale purification of ALV in China, laying hens and broilers with ALV infection are rarely detected, but ALVs are still frequently detected in local chickens, which suggests that more efforts should be applied to purification of ALV from indigenous chickens.",,"Meng, F.;Li, Q.;Zhang, Y.;Zhang, Z.;Tian, S.;Cui, Z.;Chang, S.;Zhao, P.",2018.0,,10.1186/s12985-018-0947-1,0
1370,"[Isolation and identification of arboviruses from mosquito pools in some regions of Liaoning Province, China]","Isolate and identify arboviruses from mosquito pools in some regions of Liaoning province. Mosquitoes were collected from Shenyang, Yingkou, Panjin, Jinzhou, and Dandong cities in Liaoning province in 2006. Viruses were isolated by inoculating the samples into C6/36 and BHK-21 cells. The new isolates were identified by serological and molecular biology methods. A total of 5,410 mosquitoes were collected from the five cities in total. Three isolates produced CPE in C6/36 cells and five isolates produced CPE in C6/36 and BHK-21 cells. Three isolates (LN0684, LN0688 and LN0689) were identified as Banna virus and one isolate (LN0636) was identified as Getah virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the three Banna virus strains clustered on the same evolutionary branch as the other Chinese isolates. Nucleotide sequence identity was between 91.2% and 94.7%, compared to other Banna virus strains. The newly isolated Getah virus was grouped on the same branch with the South Korean (swine) strain. The nucleotide sequence identity was 99.2%, compared to the South Korean strain and 95% to 99% to the strains from Russia, mainland China, and the Taiwan region. Conclusion Eight virus isolates, including three Banna viruses, one Getah virus, and four unknown virus strains, were isolated from mosquitoes in Liaoning province.

1371,Porcine hepatitis E virus: Cross-species infection and risk in xenotransplantation,"Porcine hepatitis E virus (porcine HEV), a recently discovered ubiquitous agent in pigs, is closely related antigenically and genetically to human HEV. HEV infection in pigs typically occurs around 2-3 months of age, and about 80% to 100% of pigs on commercial farms in the US were infected. Swine HEV infections have now been recognized in pigs in many other countries around the world. Interspecies transmission has been documented, as porcine HEV infects non-human primates and some strains of human HEV infect pigs. Recent seroepidemiological studies showed that swine veterinarians and other pig handlers are at increased risk of HEV infection compared to normal blood donors. In addition, new human HEV strains recovered from hepatitis patients in the US, Japan, and Taiwan are genetically more closely related to porcine HEV strains from the respective countries than to other human HEV strains. The ubiquitous nature of the virus in pigs and the demonstrated capacity for cross-species infection raise a potential concern for porcine HEV infection in pig organ xenografts.

1372,Molecular Cloning and Nucleotide Sequencing of the 3'-Terminal Genomic RNA of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus,"Genomic RNA from a US porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) isolate, VR 2385 (ATCC), was copied into cDNA after priming with oligo(dT) and cloned into phage lambda. cDNA clones representing the 3'-terminal genomic RNA of the virus were isolated and sequenced. The genome is a positive strand polyadenylated RNA with an estimated size of 15 kb. Analysis of the resulting sequence identified three complete open reading frames (ORFs) with the potential to encode polypeptides with predicted M(r) of 22.2 K (ORF 5), 19.1 K (ORF 6), and 13.6 K. K (ORF 7). ORF 7, which is closest to the 3' end, is predicted to encode a highly basic nucleocapsid protein that shows 58% amino acid identity to the corresponding protein from Lelystad virus (LV), a European isolate of PRRSV. ORFs 6 and 5, which precede ORF 7, are predicted to encode proteins that contain several hydrophobic domains that are believed to be membrane-associated. The VR 2385 ORF 6 protein is the most conserved structural protein. It has 78% amino acid identity with the equivalent LV protein and ORF 5 shares only 54% of its amino acid sequence. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3' coterminal nested set of six subgenomic RNAs in CRL 11171 cells infected with VR 2385 virus. Our results indicate that VR 2385, like LV, is a member of the recently proposed arterivirus group. However, the marked genetic variation and difference in pathogenicity between LV and VR 2385 suggest that the viruses causing PRRS in the US and Europe are highly variable and may represent different genotypes.",,"Meng, X.

The US isolate showed sequence variation in ORFs 2 to 4 compared to the other US isolates. A hypervariable region with antigenic potential was identified within the major envelope glycoprotein. Phylogenetic analysis of ORFs 2 through 7 indicated the existence of at least three minor genotypes within the main US genotype. The low-virulence US isolate formed a distinct branch from the other US isolates. The results of this study have implications for both PRRSV taxonomy and vaccine development.",,"Meng, X. J.;Paul, P.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate this classification of viruses and its influence on cell morphology. Healthy adult guinea pigs were studied. The spiral ganglion was serially sectioned and examined by electron microscopy. All spiral ganglia examined from various populations of guinea pigs of different breeds showed intracytoplasmic virus in some granular spiral ganglion cells. According to their location and morphology, these viruses are classified in the group of oncorna viruses, which does not agree with the classification of other authors. There appears to be a worldwide latent viral infection in guinea pigs. The accumulation of lysosomal-like vacuoles in the vicinity of the virus indicates increased local lysosomal activity of infected ganglion cells. Considering the otherwise normal ultrastructure of the infected cells, an additional influence of these viruses on intracellular metabolism cannot be proved or denied.",,"Merck, W.;Kistler, G.

1375,"Characterization of Newcastle disease viruses isolated from chickens, game birds, pigeons and quail in Mexico","Velogenic Newcastle disease has threatened the Mexican poultry industry since 1946. Seven strains of velogenic Newcastle disease virus were isolated from poultry and other bird species in central and northern Mexico between 1998 and 2006 and subjected to to phylogenetic analysis and biological characterization using standard pathogenicity and exposure tests. studies. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all velogenic strains belonged to genetic group V and are clearly divided into two lineages, since the phylogenetic similarities between groups are only 93-94%. Isolates from 1998 to 2001 are closely related to the strain responsible for the 2000 outbreak in the La Laguna region (Torreón strain) and are phylogenetically distinct from viruses isolated between 2004 and 2006 that are genetically related to the Chimalhuacán strain isolated. in 1973. All viruses from the Chimalhuacán and Torreón groups contained a virulent fusion protein cleavage site represented by the ""GGRRQKRF"" motif, revealing that the evolutionary changes occurred at a different site. The mean value of chick embryo death time was shorter for Chimalhuacán-like viruses (43.9 hours), compared to the 1998-2001 average (54.3 hours). The average ICPI value was higher (1.92) for viruses isolated during 2004-2006 than for viruses isolated before 2001 (1.74). Microscopic evaluation of the bursa of Fabricius and thymus of 5w-o broilers challenged with 106 LD50/0.2 ml showed that the Chimalhuacan-like isolate caused more severe lesions at 48 hpi in the bursa and 72 and 96 hpi in the scam than the isolated one similar to Torreón. Together with the MDT, ICPI, and microscopic results, our findings suggest that some distinct selective pressure on the highly virulent Chimalhuacan strain isolated in the early 1970s may have led to the appearance of the still velogenic but less virulent new group (similar to Torreón) in the mid-1990s. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media BV",,"Merino, R.;Villegas, H.;Quintana, J.

1377,"The first ""virus hunters""","The history of virology is a history of inventions and conceptual and technological advances. The development of filters made of porcelain or kieselguhr in the late 19th century that retained bacteria allowed the identification of infectious agents smaller than bacteria and not cultivable in the media known at the time and used to culture bacteria. Even the finest grained filters resulted in the observation that the new ultra-visible infectious agents are, in fact, particulate in nature. Plant and animal infections were the first to be attributed to these tiny entities. The test resulted from experimental infection of natural hosts (including humans). Thus, of the first 30 viruses identified, 20 are veterinary viruses, that is, infectious agents of birds and livestock. The discovery that bacteria also have viruses in the 1910s expanded the viral universe that continues today. Filterability and ultravisibility remained a hallmark for virus identification until the advent of the electron microscope in the late 1930s, marking another technological advance in virology. Cell culture techniques allowed the spread of the virus outside the infected organism. In recent decades, the advent and development of molecular biology has brought further innovations culminating in the rapid and accurate determination of genomic material from a variety of living beings, including viruses, at a speed and depth hitherto unknown using sequencing. state-of-the-art and metagenomic analyses.

1378,Interspecies transmission of the influenza virus,"Influenza is an infection of humans and various animal species. It is caused by influenza viruses that belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Type A influenza viruses are the most important as they cause severe epidemics and are responsible for important pathological problems. Type A influenza viruses are classified into different subtypes based on the nature of their surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). The nature of the genome and the mode of replication of influenza viruses explain the high variability of these two proteins that are responsible for immunity to the virus. The continuous appearance of point mutations in the gene that encodes protein H leads to the progressive appearance of new viral strains. This event, which is called antigenic drift, makes it necessary to annually evaluate the composition of the human influenza vaccine. Genetic rearrangement is another mechanism of antigenic variation. When the gene encoding the H protein, or when both the genes encoding the H and N proteins are involved in the genetic rearrangement, a new viral subtype is produced that replaces the previous one. This event, called an antigenic shift, occurs occasionally every 10 to 30 years and is responsible for major human pandemics. The role of animals and particularly the importance of pigs and poultry in the emergence of these new viruses is discussed.",,"Meulemans, G.",1999.0,,,0

ORFs 2 to 7 were cloned into plasmids downstream of the Sp6 RNA polymerase promoter, and translation of the generated transcripts in vitro produced proteins that could be immunoprecipitated with porcine anti-LV serum. Synthetic polypeptides of 15 to 17 amino acids from the amino acid sequences of ORFs 2 to 7 were selected and antipeptide sera were cultured in rabbits. Antisera were obtained that immunoprecipitated the in vitro translation products of ORFs 2 to 5 and 7. Sera containing antibodies directed against peptides of ORFs 3 to 7 reacted positively with LV-infected alveolar lung macrophages in the monolayer assay. of immunoperoxidase. Using these porcine anti-peptide and anti-LV sera, we identified three structural proteins and assigned their corresponding genes. The virions were found to contain a 15 kDa nucleocapsid protein (N), an 18 kDa non-glycosylated membrane protein (M), and a 25 kDa glycosylated membrane protein (E). Protein N is encoded by ORF7, protein M is encoded by ORF6, and protein E is encoded by ORF5. Protein E in virus particles contains one or two N-glycans that are resistant to endo-β-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase H.

It was first described in Kenya in 1921 and since then many isolates have been collected around the world. However, although several phylogenetic studies have been carried out to understand the relationships between the isolates, molecular dating analyzes have not been achieved so far. In this paper, comprehensive phylogenetic reconstructions were performed using newly generated and publicly available sequences from hundreds of ASFV isolates from the last 70 years. Analyzes focused on the B646L, CP204L, and E183L genes from 356, 251, and 123 isolates, respectively. Phylogenetic analyzes were achieved using maximum likelihood and Bayesian coalescence methods. A new lineage-based nomenclature is proposed to designate 35 different groups. In addition, dating of the origin of ASFV from the molecular data sets was carried out. To avoid bias, diversity due to positive selection or recombination events was neutralized. Molecular clock analyzes revealed that currently circulating ASFV strains have evolved over 300 years, with a time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in the early 18th century. © 2013 Michaud et al.",,"Michaud, V.;Randriamparany, T.;Albina, E.",2013.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0069662,0

1384,Rotavirus Vaccines: An Overview,"Rotavirus vaccine development has focused on the administration of live attenuated strains of rotavirus orally. The initial 'Jennerian' approach involving vaccines against bovine rotavirus (RIT4237, WC3) or rhesus (RRV) showed that these vaccines were safe, well tolerated and immunogenic, but induced widely variable rates of protection against rotavirus diarrhoea. The goal of a rotavirus vaccine is to prevent serious illnesses that can cause dehydration in infants and young children in both developed and developing countries. These studies led to the concept that a multivalent vaccine representing each of the four epidemiologically important VP7 serotypes might be needed to induce protection in young infants, the target population for vaccination. Human-animal rotavirus rearrangements were developed as vaccine candidates whose gene encoding VP7 was derived from its human rotavirus parent but whose remaining genes were derived from the animal rotavirus parent. The largest experience with a multivalent vaccine to date was obtained with the quadrivalent preparation containing RRV (VP7 serotype 3) and human RRV rearrangements with specificity for VP7 serotype 1, 2 and 4. Preliminary results from efficacy trials in the The United States have shown promise, while a study in Peru has shown only limited protection.

Although these viruses have been cultured several times from cattle egrets, seabirds, and their ticks, efforts to classify them taxonomically using conventional electron microscopic and serological approaches have failed completely. We used a random shotgun sequencing strategy to define the NYMV and MIDWV genomes. Contigs of 11,631 and 11,752 nucleotides were assembled, representing the complete NYMV genome and the nearly complete MIDWV genome, respectively. Each virus genome was predicted to carry six open reading frames (ORFs). BLAST analysis indicated that only two of the ORF proteins from each virus, the putative nucleocapsid and the polymerase, had detectable sequence similarity to known viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of these ORF proteins showed that the closest relatives of NYNV and MIDWV are negative-stranded RNA viruses of the order Mononegavirales. On the basis of their very limited sequence similarity to known viruses, we propose that NYMV and MIDWV define a new genus, Nyavirus, in that order.

After a 2-year hiatus after the initial announcement, the first devices were released as part of an early access program. We explored the performance of this platform by resequencing the phage lambda genome and amplicons from a snake venom gland transcriptome. Although the MinION Portable Sequencer can generate more than 150 megabases of raw data in one run, at most a quarter of the resulting reads map to the reference, with less than 10% average identity. Much of the sequence consists of insert/delete errors, or appears to have no similarity to the template. Using the phage lambda data as an example, although the reads are long, averaging 5 kb, at best 890 ± 1932 bases per mapped read could match the reference without smooth clipping. Over the course of a 36-h run on the MinION, it was possible to re-sequence the 48-kb lambda phage reference with 16× coverage. Currently, substantially larger projects would not be feasible using the MinION. Without increases in precision, which would be necessary for applications such as genome scaffolding and phasing, the current utility of MinION appears limited. Library preparation requires access to a molecular laboratory and is similar in complexity and cost to other next-generation sequencing platforms. The MinION is an exciting step in a new direction for single-molecule sequencing, although it will require dramatic decreases in error rates before it fulfills its promise.",,"Mikheyev, A. S.;Tin, M.

1389,Differential interactions between peanut dwarf cucumovirus isolates and their satellite RNA,"Interactions of seven isolates of peanut dwarf cucumovirus (PSV) originating in North America, Europe, and Africa, and two variants of PSV satellite RNA (satRNA) were analyzed. Coat protein (CP) electrophoresis and immunoblot analyzes and Northern blot hybridization analyzes of viral RNAs showed that PSV isolates F352, 1339 and 1507 belonged to subgroup I, and PSV isolates W, Su and B to subgroup II. The seventh isolate, robinia mosaic virus (RoMV), clustered with subgroup isolates by CP analysis, but was related to both subgroups by RNA hybridization analysis. The ability to support the accumulation of two recently described satRNA variants, P4 and P6 satRNAs, was unrelated to the classification of PSV isolates: neither PSV W nor RoMV were helper viruses for these PSV satRNAs. The modulation of symptoms by both sat RNAs was the same: the presence of sat RNA did not modify symptoms induced by subgroup I isolates but exacerbated symptoms induced by subgroup II isolates in both tobacco and cowpea. P4 and P6 sat RNAs contained 393 nucleotides and differed by only three nucleotide substitutions. This resulted in marked differences in infectivity, accumulation level and relative encapsidation between both sat RNAs. Accumulation levels and relative encapsidation of sat RNAs were also affected by helper virus isolation.",,"MilitÃ£o, V.;Moreno, I.;RodrÃ­guez-Cerezo, E.;GarcÃ­a-Arenal, F.",1998.0,,,0
1390,Newcastle disease: Evolution of genotypes and related diagnostic challenges,"Since the discovery of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in 1926, nine class I and ten class II virus genotypes have been identified, representing a diverse and continually evolving group of viruses. The emergence of new virulent genotypes from global epizootics and the observed year-over-year changes in the genomic sequence of low and high virulence NDV imply that different NDV genotypes are evolving simultaneously in different geographic locations around the world. This great genomic diversity may be enhanced by the wide variety of bird species susceptible to NDV infection and by the availability of highly mobile wild bird reservoirs. The genomic diversity of NDV increases the possibility of diagnostic failure, resulting in unidentified infections. Constant epidemiological surveillance and proactive characterization of circulating strains are needed to ensure that PCR and immunological reagents are effective in identifying NDV circulating worldwide. For example, in the United States, the widely used real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) array gene assay for NDV identification often misses APMV-1 of low virulence in waterfowl, while the fusion RRT-PCR gene assay, used to identify virulent isolates, often misses certain virulent genotypes of NDV. A new multiplex matrix polymerase test has recently been developed that detects most viruses currently circulating worldwide and a modified fusion test for the identification of virulent viruses from pigeons circulating in the US and Europe. For newly isolated viruses with unknown sequences, newly developed random-priming sequencing methods should be incorporated into the diagnostic arsenal. Furthermore, the current system of classifying NDV into genotypes or lineages is inadequate. Here we review the recent molecular epidemiology and diagnostic issues related to NDV viral evolution and explain why a new system, based on objective criteria, is needed to categorize genotypes.",,"Miller, P.

1391,Common evolutionary origin of hepatitis B virus and retroviruses,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV), although classified as a double-stranded DNA virus, has recently been shown to replicate by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. Furthermore, the putative viral polymerase has been found to share amino acid homology with the reverse transcriptase of retroviruses. Using computer-aided DNA and protein sequence analysis, we examined the genomes of 13 hepadnavirus isolates (nine humans, two ducks, one woodchuck, and one ground squirrel) and found that other conserved regions of the hepadnavirus genome share homology with corresponding regions. of type C retrovirus genomes and retrovirus-like endogenous human DNA elements. Specifically, the most highly conserved sequence of the HBV genome, located at or near the initiation site for first-strand HBV DNA synthesis, is 67 nucleotides homologous to the U5 region, a comparable region in long terminal repeats. of retroviruses. Within a highly conserved (ie, 90%) 16-nucleotide sequence, a CCTTGGG heptanucleotide sequence has 97% homology among 27 virus isolates. In addition, we found that the highly conserved HBV core protein, or nucleocapsid, shares 41% homology at 98 amino acids with the carboxyl-terminal region of the p30 gag nucleocapsid protein of type C retroviruses. In both cases, at As with the polymerase homology reported above, HBV is more homologous to murine leukemia/sarcoma retroviruses. Further analysis revealed additional similarities between the hepadnavirus and retroviral genomes. Taken together, our results suggest that HBV and retroviruses have a common evolutionary origin, with HBV arising through a process of shedding a retrovirus or retrovirus-like parent.",,"Miller, R.

1395,Conservation of gene cassettes among various human gut viruses,"Viruses are a crucial component of the human microbiome, but large population sizes, high sequence diversity, and high frequencies of novel genes have made genomic analysis by high-throughput sequencing difficult. Here we investigate metagenomic assembly approaches to probe genome structure in a 5.6 Gb sample of intestinal viral DNA sequence from six individuals. Testing showed that a new pipeline based on the DeBruijn graph assembly produced longer contigs that were able to recruit more reads than the equivalent non-optimized single-pass approach. To characterize gene content, the RefSeq viral protein database was compared to the assembled viral contigs, generating a bipartite plot with functional cassettes linking the viral contigs, revealing a high degree of connectivity between various genomes that they involve multiple genes of the same functional class. In a second step, open reading frames were grouped by their co-occurrence into contigs in a database-independent manner, revealing conserved cassettes of cooriented ORFs. These methods reveal that free-living bacteriophages, although generally different at the nucleotide level, often have significant similarity at the level of encoded amino acid motifs, gene order, and gene orientation. These findings connect contemporary metagenomic analysis with classical studies of bacteriophage genomic cassettes.

1396,Phylogenetic evidence for a recent spread of two populations of human enterovirus 71 in European countries.,"Human enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is the cause of seasonal epidemics of foot-and-mouth disease and of less frequent but serious neurological manifestations. Uncertainty persists about the circulation of virus populations in various geographic areas and the timing of its spread. We determined the EV-71 sequences at loci 1D (VP1 capsid protein) and 3CD (nonstructural proteins) in 86 strains recovered in Austria, France, and Germany and performed an evolutionary genetic study of existing virus populations. Phylogenetic analyzes positioned 78 of the 86 sequences within two clades between subgenogroups C1 and C2. A minor sequence group was assigned to subgenogroup C4. Analyzes incorporating available sequences estimated the substitution rate in genogroup C at 3.66 × 10-3 and 4.46 × 10-3 substitutions per site year-1 for loci 1D and 3CD, respectively, assuming a model relaxed molecular clock for sequence evolution. Most of the 'European' strains belonged to clades C1b and C2b, originating in 1994 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1992.7-1995.8] and 2002 (95% CI, 2001, 6-2003.8), respectively. Estimates of divergence times for the 3CD locus were consistent with measurements for the 1D locus. The intertwining between clades representing EV-71 subgenogroups and clades corresponding to other enterovirus types (particularly early coxsackievirus A prototype strains) in the 3CD phylogeny is highly indicative of ancestral recombination events. The inconsistent phylogenetic patterns estimated for the 1D and 3CD loci show that a single tree cannot model the epidemic history of circulating EV-71 populations. The estimated genogroup C evolutionary timescale for both loci was measured in decades only, indicating recent spread. © 2010 SGM.",,"Mirand, A.;Schuffenecker, I.;Henquell, C.;Billaud, G.;Jugie, G.;Falcon, D.;Mahul, A.;Archimbaud, C.;Terletskaia-Ladwig, E.;Diedrich, S.;Huemer, H.

1397,Genetic diversity of bovine mucosal disease and diarrhea virus,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is classified as a member of the Pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. BVDV is one of the most important viral pathogens of ruminants worldwide, causing serious economic losses. Infection results in a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild respiratory disease to stillbirth and mucosal disease. The virus particles are small and contain an approximately 12.3 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule with a large open reading frame flanked by two untranslated regions (5'UTR and 3'UTR). The polyprotein is proteolytically cleaved by viral and host proteases, resulting in the formation of mature viral proteins. It is well established that BVDV strains show considerable genetic diversity. BVD viruses are classified into two species: BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. Recently, a new putative species, BVDV-3, was detected. Viruses exist as one of two biotypes: cytopathic or noncytopathic, depending on their activity in cell culture. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5'UTR and Npro region has revealed at least 21 distinct subtypes of BVDV-1 and 4 subtypes of BVDV-2. The genetic diversity of BVD viruses has serious clinical implications, such as immune evasion, increased virulence, altered host range, and also affects the efficacy of vaccination programs and diagnostic methods.",,"MirosÅ‚aw, P.;Antos, A.;Polak, M.",2017.0,,,0

Nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect BVDV-2 in one of 1561 blood samples randomly collected from 78 flocks of sheep in 11 states of India. Antigenic characterization of the isolated pestivirus using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies typified the isolate as BVDV-2. When analyzed at the genetic level at Npro (N-terminal autoprotease) and the entire region of the gene encoding structural proteins, namely the capsid protein (C) and the envelope proteins Erns (secreted ribonuclease), the organization genomics of E1 and E2 was the same for all pestiviruses, the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences showed the greatest similarity to those of BVDV-2. When compared to BVDV-2 isolate 890, sequence homology was 83.7% for C, 84.6% for Erns and E1, and 81.5% for E2. The C/Erns cleavage site was found to be fully conserved while Npro/C was conserved only from the C-terminus of Npro, the Erns/E1 site was conserved only from the C-terminus of Erns, and the E1/E2 site it was conserved only from the C-terminus of Npro. E1. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences in the 5'' untranslated regions (UTR), Npro, E2, NS3 and NS5B regions placed the sheep isolate in a separate clade within the BVDV-2 subtype b. This was supported by the presence of single mutations in structural protein coding regions other than NS3 and NS5B. To our knowledge, this is the first report on sequence analysis of the entire structural gene coding region of a BVDV-2b isolate.

Nucleotide substitutions at 795G, 827T, 833C, 857C, 897A, 905T, 908T, 1011A, and 1094G specific for very virulent (vv) strains were maintained in all four field isolates. However, single nucleotide substitutions at 806A-G, 851C-T, 1010 TC, 1019T-C, and 1082T-C showed a greater divergence of these isolates from the already reported vvIBDVs.

The viruses are serologically closely related and share a common host spectrum, ie pigs and numerous live domestic and wild ruminants. Interspecies transmissions occur frequently. Despite some common features in their natural hosts, the pathogenesis of pestivirus-induced disease is complex; in particular, some aspects of the highly lethal mucosal disease of cattle remain enigmatic. Pestiviruses are among the smallest enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses with an icosahedron-shaped nucleocapsid. They are currently classified as Togaviridae. However, based on recent advances in the molecular characterization of viruses, their taxonomic relocation seems inevitable. The viral RNAs studied so far show a large open reading frame and no subgenomic RNA can be demonstrated in infected cells. Structural proteins are encoded by genes located at the 5' end of the RNA. Most of the genome codes for 2-3 nonstructural proteins. Virions are composed of a major and a minor glycoprotein with molecular weights of 53 and 48 kD, respectively. The core is composed of a small protein with a molecular weight of 20 kD.

To investigate the presence of BKoV in Egypt, 36 fecal samples from calves with diarrhea in two different Egyptian provinces (Cairo and Sharkia) were examined by RT-PCR and 24 (66.7%) were positive for BKoV. RNA from one of the positive samples (BKoV/Egy-1/KY407744) was subjected to next-generation sequencing to determine the complete sequence of the BKoV genome. Compared to the only recorded BKoV genome sequence (BKoV/U-1/AB084788), the strain studied showed 94 amino acid (aa) substitutions throughout its polyprotein (2463 aa), one nucleotide insertion (nt) and one deletion of one nt in gene 2B and deletions of 4 nt in the UTR (2 each). In addition, five VP1 and seven 3D sequences were obtained from other samples by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. A discrepancy in the phylogenetic topography of VP1 and 3D was observed, where the Egyptian VP1 sequences were classified as a distinct group within the proposed lineage 1 (genotype A), which also contained strains from the United Kingdom, Brazil, and Japan.

In the present study, a DNA vaccine containing the F and HN surface antigens of a highly virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV), NDV/1/Chicken/2005 (FJ939313), was successfully generated. Cell transfection testing indicated that the vaccine expressed the F and HN genes in Hep-2 cells. The primary objective of this study was to compare the extent of protection induced by DNA vaccination after challenge with homologous and heterologous NDV, as determined by the amount of NDV clearance after challenge. NDV antibody-negative chickens were vaccinated once, twice, or three times intramuscularly at 7, 14, and 21 days of age and challenged 14 days after vaccination with either homologous virus (NDV strain). vaccine-compatible velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease (vvNDV, FJ939313), phylogenetically related to group VII, or a phylogenetically divergent heterologous virus (unmatched vvNDV strain, AY968809), belonging to genogroup VI and showing nucleotide similarity of the 84.1% matched the NDV sequences of the DNA vaccine. Our data indicate that birds receiving a single dose of the DNA vaccine were poorly protected, with only 30-40% of these birds surviving after challenge with a high virus shedding titer. Multiple administration of the DNA vaccine induced high protection rates of 70-90% with reduced virus shedding compared to unvaccinated and challenged birds.

Similar to the 1D region, this deletion group is gradually genetically diverging even in the L region forming more lineages and the distance between lineages in the L region is considerably larger than that in the 1D region. The deletion group is restricted to India only because none of the exotic sequences cluster within this group. In particular, the L protein exhibited variability comparable to outer capsid proteins, as evidenced by its high dN/dS ratio (0.105), number of variable amino acid positions (41%), low Ts/Tv ratio ( 3.47) and the alignment revealed the N-terminal region, the Î²2 sheet and the C-terminal extension are extremely variable. Basic residues at P1, P3 and only leucine at P2 were predicted to provide an optimal autocatalytic cleavage site at the L/P1 junction. All eight sites identified to be under positive selection revealed aa substitutions of varied physicochemical properties and lineage-specific signatures were observed at two positions, supporting the contention that lineages are evolving under differential selection pressure to adapt to the varied ecological environment. . © 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Mohapatra, J.

1413,"Genetic variability of the VP6, VP7, VP4 and NSP4 genes of group H porcine rotavirus detected in Brazil","Rotaviruses (RV) are a common cause of viral gastroenteritis in humans and animals. Despite the seven RV groups/species (AG), the creation of a new RV group/species H (RVH) based on VP6 sequence analysis was recently proposed. In this study, we determined the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of VP6, VP7, VP4 and NSP4 of 6 (BR59-BR64) HRV-positive stool samples obtained from piglets with diarrhea in Mato Grosso do Sul, Central-West region of Brazil in 2012, using the RT-PCR assay. Based on the high sequence identities (>99%) of the VP6, VP4, VP7 and NSP4 genes among 5 of the fecal samples studied (BR59-BR63), they are considered the same local rotavirus strain called RVH/BRA-1 . In contrast, since fecal sample BR64 showed a relatively high difference (81.6% nt identity and 83.4% aa identity) in VP7 sequence compared to the other 5 samples, it was named RVH strain. /BRA-2. Comparative phylogenetic analysis showed that the 6 HRV strains do not cluster with any available sequence of members of the established RV groups (RVA-RVG); however, they appear to be related to RVB and RVG. These results confirm the presence of HRV in Brazil, demonstrate its genetic diversity, and provide new data that will help understand viral phylogeny and epidemiology, as well as explain the patterns of viral evolution and the biological properties of HRV.",,"Molinari, B.

1415,The genome of the chicken bursal lymphoma cell line DT40,"The DT40 chicken cell line is a widely used model system in the study of multiple cellular processes due to the efficiency of homologous gene selection. The cell line was derived from bursal lymphoma induced by avian leukosis virus infection. In this study, we characterized the genome of the cell line using whole genome shotgun sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism array hybridization. The results indicate that wild-type DT40 has a relatively normal karyotype, except for gains in whole chromosome copy number, and there is no karyotype variability within populations. In a comparison with two domestic chicken genomes and the Gallus gallus reference genome, we found no unique mutational processes that shaped the DT40 genome, except for a slight increase in insertion and deletion events, particularly tandem repeat deletions. . We mapped coding sequence mutations that are unique to the DT40 genome; mutations that inactivate the PIK3R1 and ATRX genes likely contributed to oncogenic transformation. In addition to a known avian leukosis virus integration into the MYC gene, we detected other integration sites that would likely dysregulate gene expression. The new findings support the hypothesis that DT40 is a typical transformed cell line with a relatively intact genome; therefore, it is well suited to the role of a model system for DNA repair and related processes. The sequence data generated by this study, including a searchable de novo genome assembly and annotated lists of mutated genes, will support future research using this cell line.",,"MolnÃ¡r, J.;PÃ³ti, A.;Pipek, O.;Krzystanek, M.;Kanu, N.;Swanton, C.;TusnÃ¡dy, G.

1417,Viruses isolated from reptiles: identification of three new members of the family Rhabdoviridae,"The growth of four viruses isolated from lizards in Brazil (Marco, Chaco and Timbo viruses) and Australia (Almpiwar virus) in a variety of continuous cell lines of mammalian, reptilian, amphibian and piscine origin was studied. Although replication was found in certain cell lines derived from cold-blooded species, the cytopathic effect (CPE) was absent or minimal and growth was less than or equal to that of mammalian cells. These observations appear to limit the value of poikilothermic cells for the primary isolation of viruses from field-collected cold-blooded vertebrates or arthropods that feed on them. All four reptile viruses were found to be naturally occurring temperature-sensitive agents, with optimal growth at approximately 30°C. Electron microscope studies showed that three of the viruses (Marco, Chaco and Timbo) were new members of the Rhabdoviridae family. Marco virus particles were cone-shaped and resembled bovine ephemeral fever virus and two lyssaviruses (Kotonkan and Obodhaing). Chaco and Timbo viruses were cylindrical viruses that resembled other rhabdoviruses with longer particle lengths than the prototype VSV. No serologic relationships were found in cross-complement fixation tests between these viruses, Marco virus, and 34 other rhabdoviruses.",,"Monath, T. P.;Cropp, C. B.;Frazier, C. L.",1979.0,,,0

1419,Comparison of four regions in the replicase gene of heterologous strains of infectious bronchitis virus,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) produces six subgenomic (sg) mRNAs, each containing a 64-nucleotide leader (nt) sequence, derived from the 5â€² end of the genome by a discontinuous process. Several putative functional domains, such as papain-like proteinase (PLpro), major protease (M pro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and replicase gene-encoded RNA helicase, are important for replication. of the virus. We have sequenced four regions of the replicase genes corresponding to the PLpro, Mpro and RdRp domains of the 5'-terminal sequence of 20 heterologous IBV strains and compared them with previously published coronavirus sequences. All PLpro and 5â€²-terminal domains of the coronavirus were divergent, unlike the Mpro and RdRp domains which were highly conserved with 28% and 48% conserved residues, respectively. Among the IBV strains, the 5' untranslated region including the leader sequence was highly conserved (>94% identical); while the N-terminal coding region and PLpro domains were highly variable, with identity ranging from 84.6% to 100% and 77.6% to 100%, respectively. The IBV Mpro and RdRp domains were highly conserved with 82.7% and 92.7% conserved residues, respectively. The BJ strain was the most different from other IBVs in all four replicase regions. The replicase gene-based phylogeny-based clustering was identical to the antigen-based classification of coronaviruses into three clusters. However, classification of IBV strains based on replicase gene domains did not correlate with that of type-specific antigenic groups. The replicase gene sequences of many IBVs recovered from infected chickens were identical to those of the vaccine viruses regardless of serotype, suggesting either that there has been an exchange of genetic material between the vaccine and field isolates or that there is a convergent evolution towards a specific replicase genotype. There was no correlation between the genotype of any region of the replicase gene and the pathotype, suggesting that replicase is not the sole determinant of IBV pathogenicity. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Determination of rotavirus types G and P was performed by nested RT-PCR. G6 was the most prevalent genotype, representing 78.5% of the samples, G10 represented 9.9% of the samples, and G8-like viruses were found in 4.7% of the samples. In 3% of samples, viruses failed to classify due to co-infection with more G-type strains, while viruses in 3.9% of samples could not be characterized with any of the G-specific primers used in this studio.

1422,Immunomodulatory effects of heat stress and lipopolysaccharides on the bursal transcriptome in two distinct chicken lines.,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to heat stress suppresses immune responses in birds, which may increase susceptibility to infectious diseases and thus intensify the negative effects of heat on bird welfare and performance. Identification of genes and pathways that are affected by high temperatures, especially heat-induced changes in immune responses, could provide targets for improving disease resistance in chickens. This study used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate transcriptome responses in the bursa of Fabricius, a primary immune tissue, after exposure to acute heat stress and/or subcutaneous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) immune stimulation in a 2 x 2 factorial design: Thermoneutral + Saline, Heat + Saline, Thermoneutral + LPS and Heat + LPS. All treatments were investigated in two chicken lines: a relatively heat and disease resistant Fayoumi line and a more susceptible broiler line. RESULTS: Differential expression analysis determined that Heat + Saline had limited impact on gene expression (N = 1 or 63 genes) in broilers or Fayoumi bursa. However, Thermoneutral + LPS and Heat + LPS generated many expression changes in Fayoumi's pouch (N = 368 and 804 genes). Thermoneutral + LPS was predicted to increase immune-related cell signaling and cell migration, while Heat + LPS would activate mortality-related functions and decrease expression in WNT signaling pathways. Further comparisons between treatments in the Fayoumi line revealed that heat stress prevented many of the expression changes caused by LPS. Although fewer significant expression changes were observed in the broiler bursa after exposure to Thermoneutral + LPS (N = 59 genes) or Heat + LPS (N = 146 genes), both treatments were predicted to increase cell migration. Direct comparison between lines (from broilers to Fayoumi) confirmed that each line had different responses to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptome analysis identified genes and pathways involved in bursal responses to heat stress and LPS and clarified that these effects were greater in the combined treatment. The interaction between heat and LPS was line-dependent, with suppressive expression changes primarily in the Fayoumi line. Potential target genes, especially those involved in cell migration and immune signaling, may inform future research on heat stress in poultry and could prove useful in improving disease resistance.",,"Monson, M.

1426,Hepatitis E virus circulation in Italy: phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis,"Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV), one of the main causes of acute viral hepatitis in developing countries, has been classified into four main genotypes and several subtypes. New genotypes have recently been identified in several mammals, including HEV genotype 3, which has a worldwide distribution. It is widespread among pigs in developed countries. Objectives: This study investigated the genetic diversity of HEV between humans and pigs in Italy. The date of origin and the demographic history of HEV were also estimated. Materials and Methods: A total of 327 HEV sequences from pigs and humans from Italy were downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information. Three different data sets were constructed. The first and second data sets were used to confirm the genotype of the analyzed sequences. The third data set was used to estimate the mean evolutionary rate and to determine the phylogeny and demographic history over time. Results: The Bayesian tree of maximum credibility of the clade and the time of the most recent ancestors estimates showed that the root of the tree dates back to the year 1907 (95% HPD: 1811 - 1975). Two main clades were found, divided into two subclades. Analysis of the horizon plot, performed separately for the human and porcine sequences, demonstrated the presence of a bottleneck only in the horizon plot of the porcine sequences. Selective pressure analysis revealed only negatively selected sites. Conclusions: This study supports the hypothesis that humans are likely to become infected after contact with porcine sources. The findings emphasize the importance of verifying the country of origin of pigs and of improving sanitary control measures from a veterinary point of view to prevent the spread of HEV infection in Italy.",,"Montesano, C.;Giovanetti, M.;Ciotti, M.;Cella, E.;Lo Presti, A.;Grifoni, A.;Zehender, G.;Angeletti, S.;Ciccozzi, M.",2016.0,,10.5812/hepatmon.31951,0

The present study was carried out for the detection and molecular characterization of astroviruses in diarrheal pigs sent to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory of the University of Minnesota. Intestinal contents of 269 pigs were examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and 62% were positive for astrovirus. Of the positive samples, 20% were positive for astrovirus alone, while astrovirus with rotavirus was detected in 58% of the samples.

Capsid gene sequencing of 56 randomly selected samples confirmed it to be a porcine astrovirus type 4 (PAstV-4) with 58-100% nucleotide identity within these viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 2 possible subgroups.

The three L-class gene segments of TARV and TERV and their encoded proteins γA, γB and γC were similar in size to those of the CRV reference strain S1133. Conserved motifs such as the C2H2 zinc-binding motif and the conserved polymerase region were present in γA and γB, respectively. A conserved motif for the ATP/GTP binding site and an S-adenosyl-. l-Methionine (SAM) binding pockets for methyltransferase were observed in the Î»C protein of ART and TERV with only one substitution compared to CRV. We propose a new genotype classification system for avian reoviruses (ARVs) based on the nt identity cutoff value for each of the L class. Based on this new genotype classification, all ARVs were divided into six, seven and eight genotypes in genes L1, L2 and L3, respectively. Interestingly, ART and TERV clustered with three CRVs (two arthritic strains from Taiwan and one enteric strain from Japan) in the L1-I genotype and formed different genotypes (L2-I, L3-I) of CRVs in the genes L2 and L3. The greatest nucleotide divergence was observed in the L1 and L2 gene genotypes, but less at the amino acid level indicates that most changes were synonymous. Compared to the L1 and L2 genes, the non-synonymous changes were more in the L3 gene.

The method, called ""combination consensus oligonucleotide reverse transcription and multiple displacement amplification"" (CORT-MDA), involves reverse transcription of viral RNA followed by rapid sequencing after amplification using only 11 degenerate oligonucleotide primers; these primers were designed against consensus regions within the open reading frames of all 124 NA-like PRRSV strains with reported full-genomic sequences. Sequencing of the 192 virus-generated shotgun clones showed 80% to 94% coverage in the reported PRRSV genomic sequence, such that only 2 or 3 unread regions had to be re-sequenced after PCR amplification using custom primers. Direct sequencing of the RT-PCR products confirmed the absolute consistency between the sequences determined by the CORT-MDA method and those of RT-PCR.

Single-locus typing has previously shown differentiation between Atlantic and Pacific strains of this virus, with little variation within each geographic clade. However, the lack of multilocus genomic sequence data makes it difficult to understand the rate and mechanisms of ChHV5 evolutionary divergence, as well as how these genomic changes may contribute to differences in disease manifestation. To assess genomic variation in ChHV5 among five Hawaiian and three Florida green sea turtles, we used high-throughput short-read sequencing of long-range PCR products amplified from tumor tissue using primers designed from the single reference genome. of ChHV5 available from a Hawaiian sea green. Turtle. This strategy retrieved sequence data from both geographic regions for approximately 75% of the predicted ChHV5 coding sequences. The average nucleotide divergence between geographic populations was 1.5%; most substitutions were fixed differences between regions. Protein divergence was generally low (mean 0.08%) and ranged from 0 to 5.3%. Several outlying genes originally identified and annotated in the reference genome were confirmed in ChHV5 genomes from both geographic locations. Unequivocal recombination events were identified across geographic regions, and the clustering of private alleles suggests the prevalence of recombination in the evolutionary history of ChHV5.

1436,A universal next-generation sequencing protocol for generating non-infectious barcoded cDNA libraries from high-containment RNA viruses,"Several biosafety level 3 and/or 4 (BSL-3/4) pathogens are high impact single-stranded RNA viruses and their genomes, when introduced into permissive cells, are infectious. Furthermore, many of these viruses are selected agents (SA) and their genomes are also considered SA. For this reason, cDNAs and/or their derivatives must be tested to ensure the absence of infectious virus and/or viral RNA prior to transfer out of the BSL-3/4 and/or SA laboratory. This greatly limits the ability to conduct viral genomic investigations, particularly the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Here, we present a sequence-independent method to rapidly amplify viral genomic RNA and, at the same time, eliminate viral and genomic RNA infectivity in multiple families of positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA+) viruses. The process generates barcoded DNA amplicons ranging in length from 300 to 1000 bp, which cannot be used to rescue a virus and are stable for transport at room temperature. Our barcoding approach allows up to 288 barcoded samples to be pooled into a single library and run on various NGS platforms without potential reconstitution of the viral genome. Our data demonstrate that this approach provides complete genome sequence information not only from high-titer virion preparations, but can also recover specific viral sequences from samples with limited starting material in the cellular RNA background, and can be used to identify pathogens. . from unknown samples. In summary, we describe a rapid universal standard operating procedure that generates high-quality NGS libraries free of infectious virus and infectious viral RNA. SIGNIFICANCE This report establishes and validates a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Selected Agents (SA) and other Biosafety Level 3 and/or 4 (BSL-3/4) RNA viruses to rapidly generate non-infectious barcoded cDNAs amenable to next generation sequencing (NGS). This removes the burden of testing all processed samples derived from high-impact pathogens before transferring them from high-containment labs to lower-containment facilities for sequencing. Our established protocol can be extended for high-throughput sequencing of hundreds of samples simultaneously, which can dramatically reduce the cost and effort required for NGS library construction. NGS data from this SOP can provide complete genomic coverage from viral stocks and can also detect virus-specific reads from limited starting material. Our data suggest that the procedure can be easily implemented and validated by institutional biosafety committees in all research laboratories.",,"Moser, L.

1437,RNA2DMut: a web tool for the design and analysis of mutations in the structure of RNA,"With the widespread application of high-throughput sequencing, new RNA sequences are being discovered at an astonishing rate. Function analysis, however, lags behind. In both the cis and trans regulatory roles of RNA, secondary structure (2D base pairing) plays essential regulatory roles. To test the function of RNA, it is essential to be able to design and analyze mutations that can affect the structure. This was the motivation for the creation of the RNA2DMut web tool. With RNA2DMut, users can enter RNA sequences to analyze, restrict mutations to specific residues, or limit changes to purines/pyrimidines. The sequence is analyzed at each base to determine the effect of each possible point mutation on the 2D structure. The metrics used in RNA2DMut are based on the computation of the Boltzmann structure ensemble and do not require a robust 2D model of RNA structure to engineer mutations. This tool can facilitate a wide range of RNA-related uses: for example, in the design and evaluation of mutants for biological assays, interrogating RNA-protein interactions, identifying key regions to alter in SELEX experiments, and improving crystallization properties. and RNA folding for structural biology. Additional tools are available to help users introduce other mutations (eg, indels and substitutions) and assess their effects on RNA structure. Example calculations are shown for five RNAs that require a 2D structure for their function: MALAT1 mascRNA, an influenza virus splicing regulatory motif, the viral non-coding RNA EBER2, the repA region of Xist lncRNA, and the human Y RNA.

Random RT-PCR was performed to amplify RNA extracted from 0.25 ml of fecal samples (N = 8) and more than 5 μg of cDNA was synthesized. High-throughput unbiased sequencing using the 318 v2 semiconductor chip of these eight samples produced 57-580 K (average: 270 K, after data analysis) reads in a single run. As a result, viral genome sequences were detected in each sample. In addition to bacteriophages, mammalian and insect derived viruses, partial genomic sequences of plant, algae and protozoan viruses were detected. Therefore, this metagenomic analysis of fecal samples could be useful to comprehensively understand gut viral populations and food sources in animals.",,"Motooka, D.;Nakamura, S.;Hagiwara, K.;Nakaya, T.",2015.0,,10.1007/978-1-4939-1743-3_11,0

Furthermore, chronic HEV infection and associated cirrhosis have been described in severely immunocompromised patients. However, only a few studies have focused on pediatric HEV infections worldwide, and only four autochthonous cases have been reported in children in developed countries. We describe here acute hepatitis E in three immunocompromised children. No case. 1 was a 9-year-old female liver transplant recipient who was diagnosed with 2009 H1N1 influenza infection along with hepatitis E. Case no. 2 was a 12-year-old boy who presented with early marrow relapse of type B lymphoblastic leukemia and in whom HEV RNA was detected over a period of 29 weeks. No case. 3 was a 9-year-old boy with a rare primary immunodeficiency due to XIAP deficiency. The HEV infections were all indigenously acquired and involved different viruses classified as subtype f, c, and e of genotype 3, which are those described in indigenous cases in Europe. These three observations lead to consider HEV as a causative agent of hepatitis in children in developed countries, and to test for HEV particularly in severely immunocompromised children who may develop chronic hepatitis E. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",,"Motte, A.;Roquelaure, B.;Galambrun, C.;Bernard, F.;Zandotti, C.;Colson, P.",2012.0,,10.1016/j.jcv.2011.11.012,0

The aim of the study was to estimate in the free-living wild boar population in the Czech Republic the prevalence of enteric viral pathogens, namely rotavirus groups A and C (RVA and RVC), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and members of the Coronaviridae family (transmissible gastroenteritis virus - TGEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus - PEDV, porcine respiratory coronavirus - PRCV and porcine hemagglutination encephalomyelitis virus - PHEV) and Picornaviridae, (teschovirus A - PTV, sapelovirus A – PSV, and enterovirus G – EV-G). In our study, fecal samples from 203 wild boar slaughtered during the 2014-2015 hunting season (October to January) were examined by RT-PCR. RVA was detected in 2.5% of the samples tested. Nucleotide analysis of the VP7, VP4, and VP6 genes revealed that four RVA strains belong to the G4P[25]I1, G4P[6]I5, G11P[13]I5, and G5P[13]I5 genotypes, and phylogenetic analysis suggested a close relationship with porcine and human RVA. The prevalence of CVR in the wild boar population reached 12.8%, PTV was detected in 20.2%, PSV in 8.9% and EV-G in 2.5% of the samples. During our study, neither PRRSV nor coronavirus were detected. Our study provides the first evidence of RVC prevalence in wild boar and indicates that wild boar could contribute to the genetic variability of RVA and also serve as an important reservoir of other enteric viruses.",,"MoutelÃ­kovÃ¡, R.;DufkovÃ¡, L.;Kamler, J.;Drimaj, J.;Plhal, R.;ProdÄ›lalovÃ¡, J.",2016.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.08.003,0
1442,Definition of an emerging disease,"Defining an emerging disease is not straightforward, as there are several different types of disease emergence. For example, there may be a 'real' emergence of a completely new disease, such as the emergence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the 1980s, or a geographic emergence in a previously unaffected area, such as the emergence of bluetongue in the Northern Europe in 2006. In addition, the disease may arise in species that were previously considered unaffected, for example the occurrence of bovine tuberculosis in wild species since 2000 in France. There may also be an unexpected increase in disease incidence in a known area and a known species, or there may simply be an increase in our knowledge or awareness of a particular disease. What all of these emerging diseases have in common is that human activity frequently plays a role in their occurrence. For example, bovine spongiform encephalopathy most likely arose as a result of changes in meat-and-bone meal manufacturing, bluetongue may have spread to colder climates as a result of uncontrolled animal trade and a relaxation of detection and surveillance of bovine tuberculosis allowed the disease to resurface in areas that had been able to drastically reduce the number of cases. Globalization and population growth will continue to affect disease epidemiology for years to come, and ecosystems will continue to evolve. Furthermore, new technologies such as metagenomics and high-throughput sequencing identify new microorganisms all the time. Change is a constant, and diseases will continue to emerge, and we need to consider the causes and different types of occurrence as we deal with these diseases in the future.",,"Moutou, F.;Pastoret, P.

1443,Stem-loop recognition by DDX17 facilitates miRNA processing and antiviral defense,"Dead-box helicases play essential roles in RNA metabolism in all species, but emerging data suggest they have additional roles in immunity. Through RNAi screening, we identified an evolutionarily conserved and interferon-independent role for the DEAD box DDX17 helicase in the restriction of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-borne virus in the family of bunyaviruses that cause severe morbidity and mortality in humans and livestock. . Loss of Drosophila DDX17 (Rm62) in cells and flies increased RVFV infection. Similarly, depletion of DDX17 but not the related DDX5 helicase increased RVFV replication in human cells. Using cross-link immunoprecipitation high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq), we show that DDX17 binds to stem loops of host pri-miRNA to facilitate its processing and also to an essential stem loop in bunyaviral RNA to constrain. the infection. Thus, DDX17 has dual roles in stem-loop recognition: in the nucleus for endogenous microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and in the cytoplasm for surveillance against structured non-self elements. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,"Moy, R.

From a diagnostic standpoint, simple polymerase chain reaction and sequencing-based molecular detection could be used for both viral identification and genotyping. This study established a new phylogenetic analysis and epidemiological comparison based on 205 bp of p72 gene sequences. Based on this partial p72 fragment, an updated list of 44 different genotypes was generated from a total of 516 ASFV sequences collected from GenBank. Nucleotide diversity was 0.04325 ± 0.00231. Analysis of spatial genetic variation divided ASFV populations from the African continent into four clades (clade A: Central and Upper East Africa; clade B: East Africa; clade C: East and South Africa; and clade D: South Africa). These results and the developed protocol could serve as useful molecular tools for the diagnosis of ASFV from degraded DNA or putrefactive samples, and also provide the phylogeographic perspective to identify the origin of viral outbreaks, facilitating planning decisions to limit their spread. .",,"Muangkram, Y.;Sukmak, M.;Wajjwalku, W.",2015.0,,10.4238/2015.May.4.15,0

We propose a definition of 'molecular surveillance' in this context and argue that molecular data is a complement rather than a substitute for a sound epidemiological study and surveillance design. Specific considerations regarding sampling are raised, as well as the importance of the relationship between the molecular clock speed of genetic markers and the spatio-temporal scale of surveillance activity, which may be control-focused or strategy-focused. .

In this study, the lineage of the canine rabies virus was determined. rabies (RABV) in Zambia by phylogenetic analysis of nucleoprotein (N) and glycoprotein (G) gene sequences. Total RNA was extracted from 87 DFAT brain samples, of which only 35 (40%) were nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for each gene and 26 were positive for both genes. Specimens positive for genes N (n= 33) and G (n= 35) were used for phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the N gene showed two phylogenetic groups in Zambia belonging to the Africa 1b lineage present in eastern and southern Africa. While one group comprised exclusively strains from Zambia, the other was more heterogeneous in RABV origins and included strains from Tanzania, Mozambique, and Zambia. Phylogenetic analysis of the G gene revealed similar RABV strains in different hosts and regions of Zambia. We designed primers for the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay from the N gene consensus sequence in an attempt to improve the molecular diagnosis of RABV in Zambia. The specificity and reproducibility of the RT-LAMP assay were confirmed with actual clinical samples. Therefore, the RT-LAMP assay presented in this study may prove useful for routine diagnosis of rabies in Zambia. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",,"Muleya, W.;Namangala, B.;Mweene, A.;Zulu, L.;Fandamu, P.;Banda, D.;Kimura, T.;Sawa, H.;Ishii, A.",2012.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2011.09.010,0

Its DNA genome has a molecular weight of about 3.3 x 106 d, and it exists as circular supercoiled, circular relaxed, and linear molecules. There are eight structural proteins, the most abundant of which has a molecular weight of about 42,000 d. Empty capsid shells with buoyant densities of 1.31 g/ml are similar in size and shape, but lack DNA and histone-like polypeptides.

Previous studies have consistently detected short DNA sequences of a papillomavirus (PV), termed feline sarcoid-associated papillomavirus (FeSarPV), in these neoplasms. The FeSarPV sequence has never been detected in any non-sarcoid sample from cats, but has been amplified from the skin of cattle, suggesting that feline sarcoids are caused by cross-species infection by a bovine papillomavirus. (BPV). The aim of the present study was to determine the PV genome containing the FeSarPV sequence. Utilizing the circular nature of PV DNA, four specifically designed 'outward facing' primers were used to amplify two approximately 4000 bp DNA segments from a feline sarcoid. The two PCR products were sequenced using next-generation sequencing and the entire PV genome, consisting of 7966 bp, was assembled and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PV was closely related to the 4 delta species BPVs-1, -2, and -13, but distantly related to any carnivorous genus of PV. These results are consistent with feline sarcoids caused by a type of BPV and we propose a classification of BPV-14 for this new PV. Initial analysis suggests that, like other delta BPVs, the BPV-14 E5 protein could cause mesenchymal proliferation by binding to platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta. Interestingly, BPV-14 has not been detected in any equine sarcoids, suggesting that BPV-14 has a host range that is limited to bovids and felines.",,"Munday, J. S.;Thomson, N.;Dunowska, M.;Knight, C.

The animals, six weeks old and clinically healthy, were inoculated with the virulent Margarita strain (secondary virus). For the exclusive detection of the Margarita strain, a specific qRT-PCR assay was designed, which showed no cross-reactivity with the Cat01 strain. Wild boars persistently infected with CSFV were protected from superinfection by the virulent Margarita strain of CSFV, as evidenced by the absence of clinical signs and the absence of detection of Margarita RNA in serum, swabs, and tissue samples. Furthermore, in PBMC, a well-known target for viral replication of CSFV, only RNA from the primary infecting virus (strain Cat01) could be detected, even after isolation on ST cells, demonstrating SIE at the tissue level in vivo. Furthermore, analysis of Margarita qRT-PCR data, by means of calculated γCt values, supported that PBMC from persistently infected animals were substantially protected from superinfection after in vitro inoculation with the Margarita virus strain, whereas this virus was able to infect naïve PBMC efficiently. In parallel, IFN-α values were undetectable in the sera of animals from Group B after inoculation with the Margarita strain of CSFV. Furthermore, these animals were unable to elicit adaptive humoral (no E2-specific or neutralizing antibodies) or cellular (in terms of IFN-γ-producing cells) immune responses after inoculation with the second virus. Finally, a sequence analysis could not detect CSFV Margarita RNA in the analyzed samples from Group B. Our results suggested that the SIE phenomenon could be involved in the evolution and phylogeny of the virus, as well as in the control of CSFV by vaccination. To our knowledge, this study was one of the first to show effective suppression of superinfection in animals, especially in the absence of IFN-α, which might be associated with a lack of innate immune mechanisms.",,"MuÃ±oz-GonzÃ¡lez, S.;PÃ©rez-SimÃ³, M.;Colom-Cadena, A.;CabezÃ³n, O.;BohÃ³rquez, J.

To reduce the economic loss caused by BLV infection, it is important to clarify the characters associated with the transmissibility and pathogenesis of BLV in cattle. In this study, we focus on viral traits and examine spontaneous mutations in the virus and viral properties by analysis of whole genome sequences and molecular clones of BLV derived from cows with and without EBL. Genomic analysis indicated that all 28 strains harbored limited genetic variation but no deletion mutations that would allow classification into three groups (A, B, and C), except for one strain. Some nucleotide/amino acid substitutions were specific to a particular group. On the other hand, these genetic variations were not associated with the host bovine leukocyte antigen-DRB3 allele, which is known to be related to the pathogenesis of BLV. In vitro viral replication activity was high, moderate, and low in groups A, B, and C, respectively. In addition, the proviral load, which is related to the transmissibility and pathogenesis of BLV, was high in cows infected with group A strains and low in those infected with group B/C strains.

In the present study, we report the complete nucleotide sequence of this virus (TTV) isolated from the serum of a West African. Based on PCR studies designed to amplify overlapping regions of the viral genome and sensitivity to mung bean nuclease digestion, the vital genome is circular and negative-stranded, comprising 3852 nt, which is 113 nt longer than the prototype isolate. from Japan. Cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation demonstrated banding of the virus at 1.31-1.34 g/mL; filtration studies indicated that TTV had a particle size of 30-50 nm. These results suggest that the virus is similar to Circoviridae, viruses known to infect plants and vertebrates (eg, birds and pigs); however, sequence similarity searches of available databases did not reveal identity between TTV and other viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes of a 260-nt region of 151 globally distributed isolates demonstrated the existence of three main TTV genotypes. Several people at high risk of parenterally transmitted virus infection were infected with more than one genotype. There was no correlation between genotype and geographic origin. Finally, intravenous inoculation of TTV-positive human serum into chimpanzees demonstrated that TTV can be transmitted to primates; no biochemical or histological evidence of hepatitis was obtained. The distinct biophysical and molecular characteristics of TTV suggest that it is a member of a new family of viruses, which we have tentatively named Circinoviridae.",,"Mushahwar, I. K.;Erker, J.

1457,Surveillance of wild birds for avian influenza virus in the Azov and Black Sea regions of Ukraine (2010-2011),"The Azov and Black Sea basins are part of the transcontinental migratory routes of wild birds from North Asia and Europe to the Mediterranean, Africa, and Southwest Asia. These regions constitute a transit area, stopover during migration and nesting for many different bird species. From September 2010 to September 2011, a surveillance study of wild birds was conducted in these regions to identify avian influenza viruses. Biological samples consisting of cloacal and tracheal swabs and fecal samples from wild birds of different ecological groups, including waterfowl, land and sea birds, were collected at bird mass accumulation sites in Sivash Bay and the Utlyuksky and Molochniy estuaries. Sampling covered the following biological cycles of wild birds: fall migration, wintering, spring migration, nesting and post-nesting seasons. A total of 3,634 samples from 66 different species of birds were collected. During the fall migration, 19 hemagglutinating viruses were isolated, 14 of which were identified as low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses subtypes H1N?, H3N8, H5N2, H7N?, H8N4, H10N7, and H11N8. From the wintering samples, 45 hemagglutinating viruses were isolated, 36 of which were identified as LPAI virus subtypes H1N1, H1N? H1N2, H4N?, H6N1, H7N3, H7N6, H7N7, H8N2, H9N2, H10N7, H10N4, H11N2, H12N2 and H15N7. Only three viruses were isolated during the spring migration, nesting, and post-nesting seasons (serotypes H6, H13, and H16). The HA and NA genes were sequenced from the H5 and N1 virus isolates, and phylogenetic analysis revealed possible ecological connections between the Azov and Black Sea regions and Europe.

1458,Prevalence and Molecular Characterization of Hepatitis E Virus in Retail Pork Products Marketed in Canada,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is very common throughout the world. HEV causes acute viral hepatitis with approximately 20 million cases per year. While HEV genotypes 1 and 2 cause large waterborne and foodborne outbreaks with significant mortality in developing countries, genotypes 3 and 4 are more prevalent in developed countries and transmission is primarily zoonotic. In North America and Europe, HEV has been increasingly detected in pigs, and exposure to pigs and pig products is considered to be the main source of infection. Therefore, we set out to investigate the prevalence of HEV in retail pork products available in Canada, by testing meal-size portions of pork pate, raw pork sausage, and raw pork livers. The presence of HEV genomes was determined by RT-PCR and viral RNA was quantified by digital droplet PCR. Overall, HEV was detected in 47% of sampled pork pâtés and 10.5% of sampled raw pork livers, but not in sampled pork sausages, and sequencing confirmed that all HEV strains they belonged to genotype 3. Further phylogenetic analyzes revealed that except for one isolate that clusters with subtype 3d, all isolates belong to subtype 3a. Amino acid variations between isolates were also observed in the sequenced capsid region. In conclusion, the prevalence of HEV in raw pork livers and pâtés observed in this study is in agreement with the current distribution of HEV in pork products reported in other developed countries.",,"Mykytczuk, O.;Harlow, J.;Bidawid, S.;Corneau, N.;Nasheri, N.",2017.0,,10.1007/s12560-017-9281-9,0
1459,Isothermal single primer amplification (SPIA) combined with next-generation sequencing provides complete coverage of the bovine coronavirus genome and greater sequence depth compared to sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA),"Coronaviruses are of great importance for both animal and human health. With the emergence of new coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the need for rapid genomic characterization is becoming more important. In addition, to understand the influence of the quasispecies of these viruses in relation to biology, techniques for full-length and deep sequence viral genome analysis are needed. In the present study, we compared the efficiency of two sequence-independent approaches [sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and isothermal single primer amplification (SPIA, represented by the Ovation kit)] together with a sequence-independent sequencing. high-throughput to generate Genome-Length Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) from a nasal swab. Both methods achieved high genome coverage (100% for SPIA and 99% for SISPA); however, there was a clear difference in the percentage of reads that were assigned to BCoV. While approximately 45% of Ovation reads map to BCoV (sequence depth 169-284,944), only 0.07% of SISPA reads (sequence depth 0-249) map to the genome reference. Although BCoV was the focus of the study, we also identified a bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) in the data sets. The trend for this virus was similar to that observed for BCoV with respect to Ovation vs. SISPA, but with fewer sequences mapped to BRBV due to lower numbers of this virus. In summary, the SPIA approach used in this study produced coverage of the entire BCoV (high copy number) and BRBV (low copy number) and high sequence/genome depth compared to SISPA. Although this is a limited study, the results indicate that the Ovation method might be a preferred approach for whole genome sequencing if low viral RNA copy number is expected and high sequencing depth is desired.",,"Myrmel, M.;Oma, V.;Khatri, M.;Hansen, H.

1460,Phylogenetic analysis of bovine viral diarrhea viruses using five different genetic regions,"phylogenetic analysis of the five different regions (5″ non-coding region (5″NCR), Npro, E2, NS3, and NS5B-3″NCR) of 48 Japanese and reported bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) genomes was performed. . Japanese BVDVs segregated into BVDV1 subdivided into six subgroups and BVDV2. One isolate, So CP/75, isolated in 1975 and previously proposed as subgroup 1e based on its 5â€²NCR sequence, was quite unique and formed an independent lineage in any region tree. Another isolate, 190CP, obtained from an experimental case of mucosal disease, was classified as subgroup 1e, defined by Becher et al. in the 5â€²NCR, Npro and E2 regions, while it was classified as subgroup 1a in the NS5B-3â€²NCR region. The genomic sequences of the American ILLC and ILLNC isolates obtained from the GenBank database were assigned to subgroup 1b in the 5â€²NCR, N pro, E2 and NS5B-3â€²NCR regions, while they were assigned to subgroup 1a in the region NS3, suggesting that recombination between virus strains classified into different subgroups had occurred in one animal.

1461,Genomic and serological diversity of bovine viral diarrhea virus in Japan,"The genomic properties of 62 bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) field isolates collected between 1974 and 1999 in Japan were investigated. The 5â€² untranslated region (UTR) was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nucleotide sequences from 244 to 247 bases were determined. Serological properties were also characterized by cross-neutralization test using antisera against the representative strain of the classified genotype. Using phylogenetic tree analysis, BVDV 1 was subdivided into two main groups, BVDV-1a (29 isolates) and BVDV-1b (27 isolates). In group 1a, 3 differed from the other viruses and were classified in a branch assigned as 1aâ€². However, 4 isolates (So CP/75, 190 CP, 190 NCP, and KS86-1-NCP) could not be assigned to group 1a or 1b. Compared to published sequence data, KS86-1-NCP, 190 CP, and 190 NCP were similar to isolates from southern Africa that have recently been proposed as BVDV 1c. The 5â€²UTR sequence of So CP/75 was unique among those of BVDV 1, suggesting that the isolate should be classified into a new genotype. Only 2 of 62 isolates collected in 1989 and 1990 were identified as BVDV 2. Cross-neutralization test results strongly supported these data, suggesting a close correlation between the 5-UTR sequence and BVDV antigenicity.",,"Nagai, M.;Ito, T.;Sugita, S.;Genno, A.;Takeuchi, K.;Ozawa, T.;Sakoda, Y.;Nishimori, T.;Takamura, K.;Akashi, H.",2001.0,,10.1007/s007050170139,0
1462,Identification and complete genome analysis of a new bovine picornavirus in Japan,"We identified novel viruses in faeces of diarrheal cattle collected in 2009 in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan, using a metagenomics approach and determined the (almost) complete sequences of the virus. Sequence analyzes revealed that they had a standard picornavirus genome organization, i.e. 5' untranslated region (UTR) - L- P1 (VP4- VP3- VP2- VP1) - P2 (2A- 2B- 2C) - P3 (3A- 3B- 3C -3D)-3'UTR- poly(A). They are closely related to other unclassified Chinese picornaviruses; bat picornavirus group 1-3, feline picornavirus, and canine picornavirus, sharing amino acid identities of 45.4-51.4% (P1), 38.0-44.9% (P2), and 49.6 -53.3% (P3), respectively. Phylogenetic analyzes and detailed characterization of the genome showed that, together with the unclassified Chinese picornaviruses, they clustered in one group for the P1, 2C, 3CD and VP1 coding regions. These viruses had conserved characteristics (eg, predicted protein cleavage sites, presence of a leader protein, functional domains 2A, 2C, 3C, and 3D), suggesting that they have a common ancestor. Reverse transcription PCR assays, using specific primers designed from the 5'UTR sequence of these viruses, showed that 23.0% (20/87) of fecal samples from cattle with diarrhea were positive, indicating the prevalence of these picornaviruses in Japanese cattle. population in Hokkaido prefecture.

1463,Whole Genome Analysis of Bovine Astrovirus from Cattle Fecal Samples in Japan: Identification of Possible Interspecies Transmission of Bovine Astrovirus,"viral metagenomics approach was used to investigate fecal samples from Japanese calves with and without diarrhea. Of the different viral pathogens detected, read counts yielded nearly complete astrovirus-related RNA sequences in 15 of 146 fecal samples collected from three different areas (Hokkaido, Ishikawa, and Kagoshima prefectures) between 2009 and 2015. Due to the lack of genetic information on bovine astroviruses (BoAstVs) in Japan, these sequences were analyzed in this study. Nine of the 15 Japanese BoAstVs were closely related to the Chinese BoAstVs and clustered in one lineage (tentatively named lineage 1) across all phylogenetic trees. Three of the 15 strains were phylogenetically separated from lineage 1, displaying low sequence identities, and were instead grouped with an American strain isolated from cattle with respiratory disease (tentatively designated lineage 2). Interestingly, two of the 15 strains clustered with lineage 1 in the open reading frame (ORF) 1a and ORF1b regions, while they clustered with lineage 2 in the ORF2 region. Surprisingly, one of the 15 strains exhibited low amino acid sequence similarity to other BoAstVs and clustered separately with porcine astrovirus type 5 in all trees and ovine astrovirus in the ORF2 region, suggesting past interspecies transmission. .",,"Nagai, M.;Omatsu, T.;Aoki, H.;Otomaru, K.;Uto, T.;Koizumi, M.;Minami-Fukuda, F.;Takai, H.;Murakami, T.;Masuda, T.;Yamasato, H.;Shiokawa, M.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Naoi, Y.;Sano, K.;Okazaki, S.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Furuya, T.;Shirai, J.;Mizutani, T.",2015.0,,10.1007/s00705-015-2543-7,1
1464,GiRaF: Robust computational identification of influenza rearrangements through graph mining,"Influenza virus reassortments, a process in which strains swap genetic segments, have been implicated in two out of three pandemics in the 20th century, as well as the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. While advances in sequencing have led to an explosion in the number of whole genome sequences that are available, an understanding of the rate and distribution of rearrangements and their role in viral evolution is still lacking. An important factor in this is the dearth of automated tools for reliable identification of rearrangements from sequence data due to the challenges of analyzing large and uncertain viral phylogenies. Here we describe a new computational method, called GiRaF (Graph-incompatibility-based Reassortment Finder), that robustly identifies rearrangements in a fully automated manner while accounting for uncertainties in the inferred phylogenies. The algorithms behind GiRaF search large collections of sampled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) trees for groups of incompatible splits using a fast biblical enumeration algorithm in conjunction with various statistical tests to identify sets of taxa with differential phylogenetic placement. GiRaF correctly finds known rearrangements in human, avian, and swine influenza populations, including the evolutionary events that led to the recent 'swine flu' outbreak. GiRaF also identifies several rearrangements not previously reported through genome-wide studies to catalog events in H5N1 and swine influenza isolates. © The Author(s) 2010.

1466,Genetic analysis of foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype A of Indian origin and detection of positive selection and recombination in capsid and leader protease coding regions,"The leader protease (Lpro) and capsid (P1) coding sequences make up approximately 3 kb of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). We studied the phylogenetic relationship of 46 FMD virus serotype A isolates of Indian origin collected during the period 1968-2005 and also eight vaccine strains using the neighbor-joining tree and Bayesian tree methods. The viruses were classified into three main groups: Asian, Euro-South American, and European. The Indian isolates formed a distinct genetic pool among the Asian isolates. The Indian isolates were further classified into different genetic subgroups (<5% divergence). The post-1995 isolates were divided into two subgroups, while some isolates originating in the year 2005 from Andhra Pradesh formed a separate group. These isolates were closely related to isolates from the 1970s. FMD virus isolates appear to undergo reverse mutation or convergent evolution in which identical sequences to the ancestors are present in circulating isolates. The eight vaccine strains included in the study were not related to each other and belonged to different genetic groups.

1467,New real-time PCR-based pathotyping and phylotyping of potentially zoonotic avian influenza viruses to subtype H5 at risk of incursion into Europe in 2017,"Since November 2016, Europe has witnessed another wave of incursions of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses of the Asian/Guangdong (gs/GD) goose lineage. Infections with H5 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses affect wild bird and poultry populations. H5 viruses from clades 2.2, 2.3.1.2c and 2.3.4.4a were previously detected in Europe in 2006, 2010 and 2014. Clades 2.2.1.2 and 2.3.2.1.c are endemic in Egypt and West Africa, respectively, and have caused deaths. There is evidence of their co-circulation in the Middle East. Viruses of the low pathogenicity H5 subtype (LPAI) are endemic in wild migratory bird populations. They potentially mutate into highly pathogenic phenotypes after transmission to poultry farms. However, to date, only the gs/GD H5 lineage had an impact on human health. Rapid and specific diagnosis marks the cornerstone for the control and eradication of HPAI virus incursions. We present the development and validation of five real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assays that allow clade-specific and pathotype-independent distinction from sequencing of major clades of HPAI H5 gs/GD virus and LPAI viruses. currently circulating Eurasians.

1468,Full genome sequence analysis of a newly emerged QX-like infectious bronchitis virus from Sudan reveals distinct recombination points,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection continues to cause economically important diseases in poultry, while different genotypes and serotypes continue to circulate throughout the world. Two infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV) were isolated from chickens with respiratory disease in Sudan. Sequence analysis of the hypervariable regions of the S1 gene revealed a close association with the QX-like genotype that had not been previously detected in Sudan. Whole genome analysis of the IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251-15/2014 isolate by next-generation sequencing revealed a genome size of 27,646 nucleotides harboring 13 open reading frames: 5'-1a-1b-S-3a -3b-EM-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3'. The highest nucleotide sequence identity of 93% for the entire genome was found with the Chinese IBV strain Ck/CH/LHLJ/140906, the Italian IBV isolate ITA/90254/2005, and the vaccine strain 4/91. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251-15/2014 isolate was grouped together with viruses of the GI-19 lineage. Recombination analysis provided evidence for distinct patterns of RNA origin in the Sudanese isolate across multiple genes. Several recombination sites were scattered throughout the genome, suggesting that the Sudan-QX-like strain arose as a single recombinant from multiple recombination events of parental viruses of genotypes 4/91, H120, and ITA/90254/ 2005.

1470,Dynamic evolution of genes derived from endogenous retroviruses expressed in bovine embryos during the placentation period,"In mammalian evolution, some of the genes essential for placental development are known to be of retroviral origin, as syncytin-1 derived from an envelope gene (env) of an endogenous retrovirus (ERV) helps in human placental cell fusion. Although the placenta serves the same function in all placental mammals, the env-derived genes responsible for trophoblast cell fusion and maternal immune tolerance differ between species and remain largely unidentified in bovines. To comprehensively examine env-derived genes that play a role in bovine placental development, we determined the transcriptomic profiles of bovine conceptions during three crucial windows of implantation periods using a high-throughput sequencer. Sequence reads were mapped to the bovine genome, where ERV candidates were annotated by RetroTector® (7624 and 1542 for ERV and env-derived genes, respectively). Mapped reads showed that approximately 18% (284 genes) of env-derived genes in the genome were expressed during placental formation, and approximately 4% (63 genes) were detected during all days examined. We verified three env-derived genes that are expressed in trophoblast cells by polymerase chain reaction. Of these three, the env-derived gene sequence with the longest open reading frame (designated BERV-P env) was found to show high levels of expression in trophoblast cell lines and is similar to that of the syncytin- Car1 found in dogs. and cats, despite their disparate origins. These results suggest that placentation depends on several retrovirus-derived genes that might have replaced endogenous predecessors during evolution. © 2013 The author(s).",,"Nakagawa, S.;Bai, H.;Sakurai, T.;Nakaya, Y.;Konno, T.;Miyazawa, T.;Gojobori, T.;Imakawa, K.",2013.0,,10.1093/gbe/evt007,0

Among 144 serum samples from wild boars captured in Mie Prefecture, 7 tested positive for HEV-RNA. The nucleotide sequence of almost the entire genome was determined for 4 of the 7 positive samples. Phylogenetic tree analyzes indicated that 6 samples were subtype 3e and 1 was subtype 3a among the 7 isolates. We identified indigenization of subtype 3e isolates in Japanese wild boar. In addition, 5 subtype 3e isolates were closely related and located on the peripheral branch of subtype 3e isolates from European countries on the phylogenetic tree. The structure indicated that the ancestor of the 5 subtype 3e isolates originated in Europe. Phylogenetic structure and coalescent analyzes suggested that subtype 3e isolates entered Japan from Europe via importation of large-breed pigs around 1966. The results also indicated that several subtype 3e lineages spread to a wide area of Japan around from 1992 and 1 of the lineages indigenized into wild boars in Mie prefecture between 1992 and 2009. The appearance of a group of wild boars on the peripheral branch in the phylogenetic lineage may indicate the direction of HEV subtype 3e gene flow from pigs to boars.

1472,Endogenous bovine retrovirus K2 envelope glycoprotein dysfunction is related to failed intracellular trafficking,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are the remnants of retroviral infection of ancestral germ cells. Mutations introduced into ERVs stop the production of infectious agents, but their effects on retroviral protein function are not fully understood. Retroviral envelope glycoproteins (Envs) are used in membrane fusion during viral entry, and we recently identified intact coding sequences for bovine endogenous retrovirus K1 (BERV-K1) and BERV-K2 Envs. The amino acid sequences of BERV-K1 Env (also called Fematrin-1) and BERV-K2 Env are similar, and both viruses are classified in the genus Betaretrovirus. Although Fematrin-1 plays an important role in cell-to-cell fusion in the bovine placenta, the BERV-K2 envelope gene is marginally expressed in vivo, and its recombinant Env protein is defective in membrane fusion due to inefficient cleavage of surface (SU) and transmembrane subunits. Here, we performed chimeric analyzes of Fematrin-1 and BERV-K2 Envs and revealed that defective BERV-K2 Env maturation contributed to failed intracellular trafficking. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis suggested that, unlike Fematrin-1 Env, BERV-K2 Env could not be transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the trans-Golgi network, where the cellular proteases required to process Env are located. retrovirals. We also identified that one of the sensitive regions for this phenomenon resided within a 65 amino acid region of BERV-K2 SU.

The presence of HEV in pig herds has been reported, but its dissemination in pig production environments is still unknown. To investigate the sources of viral contamination in the pig industry, 452 environmental and faecal samples, including samples from livestock transport vehicles, were collected over an 11-month period from ten farms and one slaughterhouse that together represent a single production network. Hepatitis E virus RNA was detected by nested RT-PCR in 32 samples from both inside and outside farm buildings, in trucks, and mostly from fomites collected in the slaughterhouse yard, such as in a utility vehicle.

1475,Genetic predisposition to acquire a polybasic cleavage site for the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus hemagglutinin,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses with hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes H5 and H7 evolve from low pathogenic precursors through the acquisition of multiple basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site. Although this mechanism has been observed to occur naturally only in these HA subtypes, little is known about the genetic basis for acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site. Here we show that consecutive adenine residues and a stem-loop structure, frequently found in the region of viral RNA encoding amino acids around the cleavage site of low pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses isolated from reservoirs of waterfowl, are important for nucleotide insertions in this region of RNA. A reporter assay for unpatterned nucleotide insertions and deep sequencing analysis of viral RNA revealed that an increased number of adenine residues and an enlarged stem-loop structure in the RNA region accelerated multiple adenine insertions and/or guanine needed to create codons for basic amino acids. acids. Interestingly, nucleotide insertions associated with the HA cleavage site motif were not primarily observed in viral RNA of other subtypes analyzed (H1, H2, H3, and H4). Our findings suggest that RNA editing-like activity is the key mechanism for nucleotide insertions, providing a clue as to why HA polybasic cleavage site acquisition is restricted to particular HA subtypes.<b >SIGNIFICANCE</b> Influenza A Viruses are divided into subtypes based on the antigenicity of the viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase. Of the 16 HA subtypes (H1 through -16) that are maintained in waterfowl reservoirs of influenza A viruses, H5 and H7 viruses often become highly pathogenic through acquisition of multiple basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site. Although this mechanism has been known since the 1980s, the genetic basis for nucleotide insertions remains unclear. This study shows the potential role of viral RNA secondary structure for nucleotide insertions and demonstrates a key mechanism explaining why HA polybasic cleavage site acquisition is restricted to particular HA subtypes in nature. Our findings will contribute to a better understanding of the ecology of influenza A viruses and will also be useful for the development of genetically modified vaccines against influenza A H5 and H7 viruses with greater stability.",,"Nao, N.;Yamagishi, J.;Miyamoto, H.;Igarashi, M.;Manzoor, R.;Ohnuma, A.;Tsuda, Y.;Furuyama, W.;Shigeno, A.;Kajihara, M.;Kishida, N.;Yoshida, R.;Takada, A.",2017.0,02 14,,0

Consistent with the genus demarcations for the family Picornaviridae (less than 40%, 40%, and 50% amino acid sequence identity at P1, P2, and P3, respectively), PPVJ represents a new genus in the family Picornaviridae. PPVJ was detected in 23.3% of faecal samples (from 58.3% of farms in a wide area) from pigs less than four months old, by reverse transcription PCR, using specific primers designed from the sequence 3D, followed by sequencing.

1477,Six-year surveillance of Newcastle disease virus in wild birds in northeastern Spain (Catalonia),"Since Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the main threats to the poultry industry, since 2010 Newcastle disease (ND) virus tests have been carried out in cases of mortality in wild birds (passive surveillance) in Catalonia. The goal is to provide an early warning system to prevent infection of poultry. Since 2010, 35 episodes of mortality in wild birds have been attributed to NDV infection. Throughout this period, there was a progressive expansion of VEN to new areas, with an increase in mortality episodes, although it is not clear whether this was a consequence of the spread of the virus or of improved surveillance. Phylogenetic analyzes indicate that two different sublineages of NDV, 4a and 4b, circulated in Catalonia. Both sublineages seem to be endemic in the wild bird population, mainly affecting collared pigeons, with a clear pattern in relation to their spatial distribution (coinciding with the distribution of this species), and their temporal distribution (with most of the cases between September and February). Until now, endemicity in wild birds has not resulted in outbreaks of ND in poultry. However, there are still many uncertainties about, for example, whether NDV can expand to new areas of Catalonia (with higher density of birds), or about the threat that the apparently newer 4a sublineage may represent. Therefore, efforts should be made so that measures to prevent infection of poultry farms are encouraged (particularly in high-risk areas and periods) and vigilance is maintained.",,"Napp, S.;Alba, A.;Rocha, A.

The VP7 (G) and VP4 (P) genes of 32 Canadian RVA strains that circulated between 2009 and 2015 were sequenced, identifying G3P[13], G5P[7], G9P[7], G9[13] and G9[19 ] combinations of genotypes. Canadian RVA strains were compared to RVA strains present in ProSystems RCE porcine rotavirus vaccine. The comparison revealed multiple amino acid differences in the G and P antigenic epitopes, independently of the G and P genotypes, but specifically in the Canadian G3, P[13] and P[19] genotypes. Our study further contributes to the characterization of RVA evolution and disease mitigation among pigs, which may optimize target vaccine design, thus minimizing RVA disease in this economically important animal population.",,"Naseer, O.;Jarvis, M.

1479,Long-term evolution of viruses: a Janus-faced equilibrium,"The popular textbook image of viruses as harmful and selfish genetic parasites greatly underestimates the beneficial contributions of viruses to the biosphere. Given the critical reliance of viruses to reproduce in an intracellular environment, viruses that engage in excessive killing (lysis) can drive their cellular hosts to extinction and will not survive. The lytic mode of virus propagation must therefore be moderated and balanced by non-lytic modes of virus dormancy and symbiosis. Here, we review recent bioinformatic and metagenomic studies to argue that viral endogenization and domestication may be more frequent mechanisms of virus persistence than lysis. We use a triangular diagram to explain the three main virus persistence strategies that explain the global extent of virus-cell interactions, including lysis, dormancy, and virus-cell symbiosis. This paradigm may help identify novel directions in virology research where scientists could artificially gain control over changing beneficial and lytic viral lifestyles.",,"Nasir, A.;Kim, K.

1480,Biological and molecular characterization of chicken anemia virus isolates of Indian origin,"In the present study, four chicken anemia virus (CAV) isolates (CAV-A, -B, -E and -P) recovered from different geographical regions of India were characterized. The CAV genome of the 1766 bp nucleotide region containing the complete coding region of the VP2 and VP3 proteins, and the partial coding region of the VP1 protein were sequenced. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of CAV isolates from India were aligned and compared with CAV isolates of European, Asian, American and Australian origin. Phylogenetic analyzes of CAV isolates from India were also carried out based on the deduced nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The results indicated that the Indian isolates evolved genetically from different parts of the world. The Indian isolate CAV-A was found to be closely related to the European strain Cux-1, CAV-B and -P were closely related to the Bangladesh strain BD-3, and CAV-E was closely related to the Australian strain 704. The pathogenicity of All four CAV isolates were studied in one-day-old Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) chicks. Day-old SPF chicks (n = 50) were divided into five groups consisting of 10 chicks in each group. Group 1 was kept as a control and groups 2-5 were infected with each CAV isolate separately. Chicks were infected at a dose of 1 ml of cell culture fluid (104.5 TCID50/0.1 ml) per bird intramuscularly. Clinical signs, mortality, and packed cell volume (PCV) and body weight gain were recorded at 5, 10, and 15 days post-infection. On day 15, all birds were sacrificed and various organs, namely thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver and bursa, were examined for gross and microscopic changes. The pathogenicity study indicated that all CAV except CAV-B were capable of producing clinical disease and immunosuppression in young chicks, while the CAV-B isolate did not produce clinical disease but only induced immunosuppression, which was revealed by microscopic examination of the chicks. lymphoid organs. The study showed valuable information on the molecular epidemiological status of CAV isolates predominant in India for the first time. © 2005 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Natesan, S.;Kataria, J.

1481,Comparison of Ultracentrifugation Purified Exosomes (UC) and Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (TEI) from Sera of Marek's Disease Virus (MDV) and Tumor-Vaccinated Chickens,"Extracellular vesicles (EV) is a collective term used to refer to microparticles, exosomes, and apoptotic bodies produced by a variety of cells and released into interstitial spaces and body fluids. Serum exosomes can serve as invaluable biomarkers, containing m/miRNA, lipids, and proteins, indicative of various conditions. There are currently limited studies on the characterization and mutual consensus of biomarker profiles of serum exosomes purified by different methods. Here we compare the advantages and disadvantages of two commonly used serum exosome purification procedures, including ultracentrifugation (UC) and total exosome isolation (TEI) reagent, by analyzing size distribution, concentration, the morphology and miRNA expression profiles of exosomes. Serum was obtained from Marek's disease virus (MDV)-infected chickens that were either vaccinated against Marek's disease (MD) and thus protected, or unvaccinated and carrying MDV-induced tumors. Nanoparticle tracking analyzes (NTA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to assess particle size, concentration, and morphological integrity, respectively. Our results indicate that the size distribution of the particles purified by either procedure is consistent with that of exosomes (30-150 nm). The TEI reagent generated higher yields and co-isolated additional EV populations that are slightly larger (∼180 nm). Based on miRNA expression profiles from a previous high-throughput sequencing experiment of small RNAs from exosomes, we selected six cellular and four MDV1 miRNAs to validate their expression in UC- and TEI-purified exosomes. The miRNA expression profiles showed a relative correlation between the two procedures, but distinctive differences in abundance were observed with TEI-purified exosomes showing higher miRNA expression consistent with higher yield than those purified by UC. TEI-purified exosomes from vaccinated chickens exhibited increased expression of the tumor suppressor miRNA, gga-mir-146b, and decreased expression of the oncomiR, gga-mir-21 compared with those obtained from tumor-bearing chickens. We propose that gga-mir-146 and -21 may serve as serum exosome biomarkers for vaccine-induced protection and MD tumors, respectively.",,"Nath Neerukonda, S.;Egan, N.

First, protein homology analyzes of more than 400 sequences revealed that this virus likely evolved from recent pig viruses. Second, phylogenetic analyzes of 5,214 protein sequences from influenza A(H1N1) viruses (avian, swine, and human) circulating in North America over the past two decades (1989 to 2009) indicated that the new virus of influenza A(H1N1) has a distinctive evolutionary trait (genetic distinction). This appears to be a particular feature in interspecies transmission of influenza A between pigs and humans. Therefore, these analyzes contribute to the evidence for the role of pig populations as ""mixing vessels"" for influenza A(H1N1) viruses.",,"Nava, G. M.;Attene-Ramos, M. S.;Ang, J.

1483,Genetic and antigenic analysis of foot-and-mouth disease virus type a isolated in India during 1987-1996.,"Twenty-three field isolates of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) type A, recovered from different outbreaks during 1987-1996 in India, were subjected to antigenic and genetic analysis. The isolates showed a close antigenic relationship with the current vaccine strain (IND 17/77) in the microneutralization test performed using an antiserum to the vaccine strain (IND 17/77) and a peptide (aa 136-151 of the VP1 protein of the A22/Azerbaijan/strain 65) antiserum. However, the isolates revealed minor antigenic differences in their reactivity with three neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize conformation-independent and trypsin-sensitive epitopes of the vaccinia virus strains. The phylogenetic relationship between the isolates was performed using a part of the ID gene (168 nucleotides at the 3â€² end). Seven additional previously reported type A Indian field isolates were included in the analysis. The percentage similarity between the Indian isolates ranged from 82.7% to 99.4% at the nucleotide level and from 83.9% to 100% at the amino acid level. These observations clearly demonstrate the genetic heterogeneity of the field isolates. The current vaccine strain IND 17/77 showed 9.7% divergence at the nucleotide level and 5.6% divergence at the amino acid level from the A22 Iraq 24/64 isolate. The field strains diverged from the IND 17/77 vaccine strain by 5.6%-14.6% and 3.7%-13.7% at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively. In the phylogenetic tree, the isolates were distributed in 21 genetic groups. The clustering pattern of isolates in the phylogenetic tree did not reveal a specific distribution pattern of FMD outbreaks in relation to their geographic locations, caused by unrestricted animal movement and the endemic nature of the disease.",,"Nayak, B.;Pattnaik, B.;Tosh, C.;Sanyal, A.;Hemadri, D.;Patil, S.

1484,Detection of new porcine bocaviruses in faecal samples from asymptomatic pigs in Cameroon,"Improvements and widespread use of nucleic acid sequencing and amplification methods have led to the recognition of a new diversity of viruses in various domestic animals, including pigs. In this study, we used virus species-specific or broadly reactive PCR assays to describe the occurrence and genetic diversity of selected DNA viruses belonging to the families Adenoviridae, Circoviridae, Anelloviridae, and Parvoviridae in Cameroonian pigs. Fecal samples were collected during the spring of 2011. Adenoviruses, circoviruses, and anelloviruses were not detected, however, a high prevalence and remarkable genetic diversity were observed within the identified parvoviruses and, in particular, within the bocaviruses. PPV4 was the most prevalent virus (20%), followed by PBoV3 (18%), PBoV4 (18%), PBoV5 plus 6V/7V (16%), and PBoV1 plus PBoV2 (6%). The frequency of mixed infections with various combinations of these virus species reached 20%.

Viral integration sites that contribute to oncogenesis are selected for in tumor cells. Deep sequencing analysis of B-cell lymphoma DNA confirmed that the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter is a common target of ALV integration. Twenty-six unique proviral integration sites between 46 and 3552 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the TERT transcription start site were mapped, predominantly in the opposite transcriptional orientation by bursa TERT transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. normal that revealed a transcribed region upstream of TERT in the opposite orientation, suggesting that the TERT promoter is bidirectional. This transcript appears to be an uncharacterized antisense RNA. We have previously shown that TERT expression is upregulated in tumors with integrations in the TERT promoter region. We now report that the viral promoter drives the expression of a chimeric transcript containing viral sequences spliced to exons 4 to 7 of this antisense RNA. The clonal expansion of cells with ALV integrations driving TERT antisense RNA overexpression suggests that it may have a role in tumorigenesis. SIGNIFICANCE: Data suggest that ALV integrations into the TERT promoter region drive overexpression of novel antisense RNA and contribute to the development of lymphomas.",,"Nehyba, J.;Malhotra, S.;Winans, S.;O'Hare, T.

1486,Molecular biology of bovine viral diarrhea virus,"Bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV) are possibly the most important viral pathogen of ruminants worldwide and can cause serious economic loss. Clinical symptoms of disease caused by BVDV range from subclinical to severe acute hemorrhagic syndromes, and the severity of the disease depends on the strain. These viruses are classified as members of the Pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae. BVDV is considered primarily a livestock pathogen but can infect most ruminant species. The virus particle consists of a lipid bilayer membrane surrounding the encapsidated genomic RNA. Embedded in the outer membrane are two virus-encoded glycoproteins that contain the major antigenic determinants of the virus, as well as receptor-binding and cell-fusion functions. A third glycoprotein is loosely associated with the virion, but also possesses unique features that play an important role in suppressing innate immunity. Viral proteins are encoded in a single large open reading frame. Viral proteins are proteolytically cleaved from the polyprotein by different proteases. Structural proteins are processed by cellular signal peptidases, while nonstructural proteins are processed by viral serine protease. The virus assembles and matures in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies of the cell. The virus is released by exocytosis, where the viral proteins are not exposed on the cell surface. © 2012.",,"Neill, J. D.",2013.0,,10.1016/j.biologicals.2012.07.002,0
1487,Simultaneous rapid sequencing of multiple RNA virus genomes,"Comparison of archived virus sequences collected over many years to the present enables the study of viral evolution and contributes to the design of new vaccines. However, the difficulty, time, and cost of generating complete sequences individually from each archived sample have hampered these studies. Next generation sequencing technologies have been used for the analysis of clinical and environmental samples to identify viral pathogens that may be present. This has led to the discovery of many new and uncharacterized viruses from several viral families. The use of these sequencing technologies would be advantageous to examine viral evolution. In this study, a sequencing procedure was used to simultaneously and rapidly sequence multiple archived samples using a single standard protocol. This procedure used primers composed of 20 bases of known sequence with 8 random bases at the 3' end that also served as an identification barcode that allowed differentiation of each viral library after pooling and sequencing. This conferred sequence independence by random priming of first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Viral stocks were treated with a cocktail of nucleases to reduce the presence of host nucleic acids. Viral RNA was extracted, followed by random-primed double-stranded cDNA synthesis in a single tube. The resulting cDNAs were amplified by primer-specific PCR, pooled, size fractionated, and sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM platform. Individual virus genomes were readily assembled by de novo and template-assisted assembly methods. This procedure consistently resulted in near-complete, if not complete, genomic sequences and was used to sequence multiple bovine coronavirus and pestivirus isolates simultaneously.",,"Neill, J.

To examine this relationship, reverse transcriptase PCRs were performed using oligonucleotide primer sets designed to amplify portions of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase 2C-like regions with total cellular RNA purified from virus-infected cell cultures as template. . 2C RNA helicase primers directed amplification of this region from eight SMSV serotypes, five VESV serotypes, and four related viruses. The RNA polymerase primer establishes amplified products from all but one of these viruses. Phylogenetic comparison of caliciviruses demonstrated that SMSV, VESV, and four related viruses are closely related but distinct from feline calicivirus, human caliciviruses (small round-shaped viruses), and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and should be classified. as a unique genotype within Caliciviridae.",,"Neill, J.

Depending on the need for immunosuppression in xenotransplantation, procedures developed to improve safety in allotransplantation may be applied in future xenotransplantation clinical trials. Standardized approaches can be developed to guide the evaluation of common infectious syndromes in xenograft recipients. The opportunity created by screening pigs destined as xenograft donors has the same applicability as allograft, in particular broader screening strategies for allograft donors, such as the use of advanced sequencing modalities including wide range molecular probes, microarrays and high-throughput pyrosequencing. Considerations in the management of infections associated with allogeneic and xenogeneic transplants are largely the same. Experience in xenotransplantation will continue to inform thinking about donor-derived infections in allogeneic transplants.

To describe the evolution of swine influenza A viruses in Mexico and evaluate strains for vaccine development, we sequenced the genomes of 59 viruses and performed antigenic mapping on strains from 5 regions.

On the basis of pairwise nucleotide sequence identity, the NA genes of two rearrangements, A/sw/Kanagawa/2/78 and A/sw/Ehime/1/80, were most closely related to those of strains of human influenza A virus isolated in 1972 and the first available H3N2 swine influenza A viruses, respectively. Phylogenetic trees showed that NA genes can be segregated into three groups, including lineages for (i) porcine strains, (ii) the oldest human strain, and (iii) recent human strains. The evolutionary tree of the 11 nucleotide and amino acid sequences suggested that the NAs of A/sw/HK/4/76 and A/sw/Kanagawa/2/78 belong to the lineage of recent human viruses. In contrast, the NA genes of A/sw/HK/3/76 and H1N2 rearranged A/sw/Ehime/1/80 viruses were found to be of porcine lineage. The NA genes of the porcine virus were further characterized by the co-circulation of two distinct lineages. Although the rates of synonymous (silent) substitutions for the porcine and human viruses were almost identical (0.00946 to 0.00884 per site per year), the rate of non-synonymous (amino acid change) substitutions for the NA genes of the porcine virus it was about 60% of that for the human virus.",,"Nerome, K.;Kanegae, Y.;Yoshioka, Y.;Itamura, S.;Ishida, M.;Gojobori, T.;Oya, A.",1991.0,,,0
1492,"Approved and Experimental Countermeasures Against Pestiviral Diseases: Bovine Viral Diarrhea, Classical Swine Fever, and Border Disease","Pestiviruses, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), classical swine fever (CSFV), and border disease virus, are important livestock pathogens in many countries, but current vaccines do not completely prevent spread of the infection. Control of pestiviral diseases is especially difficult due to the constant viremia and viral shedding of persistently infected (PI) animals, which must be identified and eliminated to prevent disease transmission. Existing vaccines are limited by the delay between vaccination and the onset of protection, the difficulty of serologically differentiating between vaccinated and naturally infected animals, and the need for extensive vaccine cross-protection against various virus strains. Antiviral therapy could potentially complement vaccination by providing immediate protection in the event of an outbreak. Numerous compounds with in vitro antiviral activity against BVDV have been identified through their role as a surrogate for hepatitis C virus. Fewer drugs active against CSFV have been identified, but many compounds that are effective against BVDV will likely inhibit CSFV, given their sequences. similar genomics. While in vitro research has been promising, a paucity of animal efficacy studies has hampered the commercial development of antiviral drugs effective against pestiviruses.

These viruses are the main pathogens and viruses isolated from man have also been shown to be infectious for pigs. Initially, these viruses were described as reoviruses, but later the names rotavirus and duovirus were proposed. They are morphologically and antigenically distinct from both reoviruses and orbiviruses, and also differ from them in some of their physicochemical properties. Studies of rotavirus structure have been limited to calf virus nucleic acid and the related epizootic diarrhea of suckling mouse (EDIM) virus. Both viruses were shown to contain RNA, and it has been suggested that the RNA of the calf virus might be double-stranded. The results of the experiments described here show that calf rotavirus possesses several of the characteristics of reo and bluetongue viruses and should be classified with them. Although calf rotavirus has a lower sedimentation coefficient and is morphologically distinct from reo and bluetongue viruses, the segmented, double-stranded nature of its RNA and the number and molecular weight of RNA and polypeptides suggest that it should be considered a member of the reo virus group and bluetongue.

Immunohistochemical staining, using a cross-reactive bovine papillomavirus antibody, suggested that ElPV-1 is present in intranuclear inclusions and intracytoplasmic keratin granules. Virus-infected cells were scattered throughout the stratum granulosum and stratum spinosum of gingival and buccal papillomas.

Virus was detected in 68% of BRD-affected animals versus 16% of healthy control animals. 38% of sick animals versus 8% of controls were infected with multiple respiratory viruses. Bovine adenovirus 3 (P<0.0001), bovine rhinitis A virus (P=0.005), and recently described bovine influenza D virus (P=0.006), which were detected alone or in combination in 62% of patients, were significantly associated with RBBB. animals with BRD. A metagenomics and real-time PCR screening approach in carefully matched cases and controls may provide a rapid means of identifying viruses associated with complex disease, paving the way for further confirmatory testing and ultimately effective intervention strategies. .",,"Ng, T.

1497,Discovery of a new single-stranded DNA virus from a sea turtle fibropapilloma using viral metagenomics,"Viral metagenomics, consisting of viral particle purification and rapid sequencing, is a powerful technique for discovering disease-associated viruses with no definitive etiology, viruses that share limited homology with known viruses, or viruses that are not cultivable. Here we use viral metagenomics to examine viruses associated with sea turtle fibropapillomatosis (FP), a debilitating neoplastic disease that affects sea turtles worldwide. Through purification and rapid sequencing of the viral community directly from the fibropapilloma of a Florida green sea turtle, a new single-stranded DNA virus, sea turtle tornovirus 1 (STTV1), was discovered. The single-stranded circular genome of Sâ€²lâ€²lâ€²Vl was approximately 1,800 nucleotides in length. Sâ€²lâ€²lâ€²Vl has only weak amino acid level identities (25%) with chicken anemia virus in short regions of its genome; therefore, STTV1 may represent the first member of a new family of viruses. A total of 35 healthy tortoises and 27 FP tortoises were tested for STTV1 using PCR, and only 2 severely affected tortoises with FP were positive. Affected tortoises were systemically infected with Sâ€²lâ€²lâ€²Vl, as STTV1 was found in the blood and in all major organs. Sâ€²lâ€²lâ€²Vl exists as a quasispecies, with several genomic variants identified in the fibropapilloma of each positive turtle, suggesting rapid evolution of this virus. STTV1 variants were identical in most of their genomes, but contained a hypervariable region with wide divergence. This study demonstrates the potential of viral metagenomics to discover new viruses directly from animal tissue, which may improve our understanding of viral evolution and diversity.

1499,Novel anellovirus discovered from captive California sea lion mortality event,"viral metagenomic study was conducted to investigate potential viral pathogens associated with a mortality event of three captive California sea lions (Zalophus californianus). This study identified a new California sea lion anellovirus (ZcAV) with 35% amino acid identity in the ORF1 region to feline anelloviruses. The double-stranded replicative form of ZcAV was detected in lung tissue, suggesting that ZcAV replicates in the lungs of sea lions. Specific PCR revealed the presence of ZcAV in the lung tissue of the three sea lions involved in the mortality event, but not in three other sea lions from the same zoo. Furthermore, ZcAV was detected infrequently (11%) in the lungs of wild sea lions. The higher prevalence of ZcAV and the presence of the double-stranded replicative form in the lungs of sea lions from the mortality event suggest that ZcAV was associated with the death of these animals.",,"Ng, T.

1500,Development and evaluation of a random non-ribosomal PCR and next-generation sequencing-based assay for the detection and sequencing of hand-foot-and-mouth disease pathogens,"BACKGROUND: Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) has become a major public health problem in the Asia-Pacific region, and is commonly caused by enterovirus A71 (EV-A71). ) and coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6), CV-A10 and CV-A16. The generation of complete genome sequences of the pathogen is essential to understand its evolutionary biology. Frequent substitutions between EV serotypes and a limited number of available whole genome sequences make it difficult to develop overlapping PCRs for whole genome sequencing. We developed and evaluated a random non-ribosomal PCR (rPCR) and next-generation sequencing-based assay for sequence-independent whole-genome amplification and sequencing of HFMD pathogens. A total of 16 EV-A71/CV-A6/CV-A10/CV-A16 PCR positive rectal/throat swabs (Cp values: 20.9-33.3) were used for assay evaluation. RESULTS: Our assay clearly outperformed conventional rPCR in terms of total number of EV-A71 reads and percentage of EV-A71 reads: 2.6% (1,275/50,000 reads) vs. 0.1% (31 /50,000) and 6% (3,008/50,000) vs. 0.9% (433/50,000) for two samples with Cp values of 30 and 26, respectively. In addition, the assay could generate genome sequences with coverage percentages of 94-100% of 4 different enterovirus serotypes in 73% of the samples analyzed, which represents the first complete genome sequences of CV-A6/10/16 from Vietnam, and could correctly assign serotyping results in 100% of the 24 specimens tested. In all but three, the consensuses obtained from two replicates of the same sample were 100% identical, suggesting that our assay is highly reproducible.

1502,Identification and genomic characterization of a new porcine parvovirus (PPV6) in China,"Background: Parvoviruses are classified into two subfamilies based on their host range: the Parvovirinae, which infect vertebrates, and the Densovirinae, which primarily infect insects and other arthropods. In recent years, several new parvoviruses belonging to the subfamily Parvovirinae have been identified from various animal and human species, including human parvovirus 4 (PARV4), porcine hokovirus, ovine partetravirus, porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4), and parvovirus porcine 5 (PPV5). Methods: Using sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA), a new parvovirus within the subfamily Parvovirinae that was distinct from any known parvovirus was identified and five complete genomic sequences were determined and analyzed. Results: A new porcine parvovirus, provisionally named PPV6, was initially identified from aborted pig fetuses in China. Retrospective studies revealed that the prevalence of PPV6 in aborted piglets and fetuses (50% and 75%, respectively) was apparently higher than in finishing pigs and sows (15.6% and 3.8%, respectively). Furthermore, the prevalence of PPV6 in finishing pigs was similar on affected and unaffected farms (ie, 16.7% vs. 13.6%-21.7%). This finding indicates that the age of the animal, perhaps due to higher innate immune resistance, strongly influences the level of PPV6 viremia. Whole genome sequencing and multiple alignments have shown that near complete genome sequences were approximately 6,100 nucleotides in length and shared 20.5% to 42.6% DNA sequence identity with other members of the subfamily Parvovirinae. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PPV6 was significantly distinct from other known parvoviruses and more closely related to PPV4. Conclusion: Our findings and review of published parvovirus sequences suggested that a new porcine parvovirus is currently circulating in China and could be classified in the new genus Copiparvovirus within the subfamily Parvovirinae. However, the clinical manifestations of PPV6 are still unknown, as the prevalence of PPV6 was similar between healthy and diseased pigs in a retrospective epidemiological study. The identification of PPV6 within the Parvovirinae subfamily provides further insight into the viral and genetic diversity of parvoviruses.",,"Ni, J.;Qiao, C.;Han, X.;Han, T.;Kang, W.;Zi, Z.;Cao, Z.;Zhai, X.;Cai, X.",2014.0,,10.1186/s12985-014-0203-2,0
1503,hepatitis e virus,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a non-enveloped positive-sense RNA virus, currently classified in a new family ""Hepeviridae genus hepevirus"" (single-stranded RNA virus). The genome (7.2kb) contains three open reading frames (ORFs) that code for non-structural (ORF1) and structural (ORF2 and ORF3) proteins. HEV infection has been associated with developing countries as one of the main causes of epidemic acute hepatitis transmitted by the fecal-oral route. But sporadic cases of hepatitis have been reported in Western countries, with no history of travel to endemic regions. Phylogenetic analysis of geographically different HEVs identified four main genotypes: genotype I bringing together Asian (I1) and African (I2) isolates, genotype II found in Mexico and Nigeria, genotype III discovered among humans and US pigs, and genotype IV in Taiwan. Additional genotypes have been described in non-HEV endemic areas (Greece, Italy, Argentina). Isolation of HEV from domestic animals supports an environmental reservoir of HEV.

1506,Genetic characterization of H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from chickens in Indonesia in 2010,"Since 2003, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses have caused outbreaks among poultry in Indonesia every year, resulting in the highest human toll worldwide. However, little is known about the H5N1 influenza viruses that have been circulating there in recent years. Therefore, we conducted surveillance studies and isolated eight H5N1 viruses from chickens. Phylogenetic analysis of their hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes revealed that all eight viruses belonged to clade 2.1.3. However, on the basis of nucleotide differences, these viruses could be divided into two groups. Other viruses genetically closely related to these two groups of viruses were all isolated from Indonesia, suggesting that these new isolates have been evolving within Indonesia.

SVDV is the causative agent of a highly contagious (although rarely fatal) vesicular disease in pigs. We report a rapid method that is suitable for sequencing the complete protein coding sequences of SVDV isolates in which the RNA is relatively intact. The approach combines a single PCR amplification reaction, using only one set of PCR primers to amplify the near-complete SVDV genome, with deep sequencing using a small fraction of the capacity of a Roche GS FLX sequencing platform. Sequences were initially verified through one of two criteria; either a match between a de novo assembly and a reference map, or a match between the five different reference maps performed against a fixed set of initial reference genomes with significant genetic distances within the same virus species. All baseline assignments used an iterative method to avoid bias. Further verification was achieved through phylogenetic analysis against published SVDV genomes and additional Enterovirus B sequences. This approach allows high confidence in the obtained consensus sequences, as well as provides sufficiently high and uniformly dispersed sequence coverage to allow future studies of variation within the host. © 2014 Nielsen et al.",,"Nielsen, S.

1508,Complete genome sequences of Japanese swine rotavirus C reveal a great diversity of individual gene genotypes and will contribute to a comprehensive and generally accepted classification system.,"Porcine rotavirus C (SVR) is distributed worldwide and is believed to be a pathogen of diarrhea in piglets. Although the VP7, VP4, and VP6 gene sequences of the Japanese porcine RVC are currently available, there are no complete genome sequence data for the Japanese RVC. Furthermore, only one to three sequences are available for the porcine RVC genes VP1-VP3 and NSP1-NSP3. Therefore, we determined near-complete whole genome sequences of nine Japanese porcine RVCs from seven piglets with diarrhea and two healthy pigs and compared them with published RVC sequences from a database. The VP7 genes of two Japanese RVCs from healthy pigs were highly divergent from other known RVC strains and were tentatively classified as G12 and G13 based on the 86% nucleotide identity cutoff. Pairwise sequence identity calculations and phylogenetic analyzes revealed that novel candidate porcine Japanese RVC genotypes were identified in the genes encoding NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3, respectively. Furthermore, VP3 of Japanese porcine RVCs was shown to be closely related to human RVCs, suggesting a genetic rearrangement event between porcine and human RVCs and past interspecies transmission.

1509,Different RNA splicing mechanisms contribute to diverse infectious outcomes of classical swine fever viruses of different virulence: insights from deep sequencing data in porcine umbilical vein endothelial cells,"The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of RNA splicing in response to viral infection are poorly understood. Classical swine fever (CSF), one of the most contagious and economically important swine diseases worldwide, is caused by classical swine fever virus (CSFV) . Here, we used high-throughput sequencing for digital gene expression (DGE) profiling in porcine umbilical vein endothelial cells (SUVEC) to identify different responsive genes for CSFV by using Shimen and C strains. The number of clean tags obtained from the control libraries and both CSFV-infected libraries was 3,473,370, 3,498,355, and 3,327,493, respectively. In the comparison between the control groups, CSFV-C and CSFV-Shimen, 644, 158 and 677 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were confirmed in the three groups. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that many of these DEGs were enriched in spliceosome, ribosome, proteasome, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, cell cycle, focal adhesion, Wnt signaling pathway, etc., where the processes differ between strains. CSFV of different virulence. To further elucidate important mechanisms related to differential infection by CSFV Shimen and CSFV C strains, we identified four possible profiles to assess genes significantly expressed only by CSFV Shimen or CSFV C. GO analysis showed that infection with CSFV Shimen and Cstrains altered the 'RNA splicing' of SUVECs, resulting in differential 'gene expression' in SUVECs. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was identified as a significant response regulator that contributed to the impact on SUVEC function for CSFV Shimen. This computational study suggests that CSFV of different virulence could induce alterations in RNA splicing regulation in the host cell to change cellular metabolism, leading to acute hemorrhage and pathological damage or infectious tolerance.",,"Ning, P.;Zhou, Y.;Liang, W.;Zhang, Y.",2016.0,,10.7717/peerj.2113,0

To investigate the extent of genomic variability of TTMDV genomes, the complete sequence of 15 TTMDV isolates obtained from viremic individuals in Japan was determined. The 15 TTMDV isolates comprised 3175-3230 bases and shared 67.0-90.3% identities with each other, and were only 68.4-73.0% identical to the 3 reported TTMDV isolates genome-wide. TTMDV possessed a genomic organization with four open reading frames (ORF1-ORF4) with characteristic sequence motifs and stem-and-loop structures with high GC content, similar to TTV and TTMV. All 18 TTMDV genomes differed up to 60.7% from each other in ORF1 amino acid sequence (658-677 amino acids), but phylogenetically segregated into the same group, which was distantly related to TTVs and the TTMVs.

Biological characterization and use for strain comparisons.,"We have isolated nine hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies directed against the HN glycoprotein of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strain D26 and classified them into three groups according to their biological reactivities. Group I antibodies from six clones had high hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neutralization titers, and exhibited neuraminidase inhibition (NI) activity with both bovine fetuin and N-acetyl neuramin lactose substrates, although the levels of inhibition maxima were higher with the first substrate. . Group II antibodies from two clones also had high HI activity but showed strongly substrate-dependent NI, with effective inhibition against fetuin and no inhibition against neuraminlactose at all. These antibodies had neutralizing ability but titers were much lower than group I antibodies. One clone (group III) secreted antibody that exhibited HI and NI with either substrate but no detectable neutralizing activity. The isolation frequency of antigenic variants and competitive binding assays have shown that group I and group II antibodies can recognize distinct non-overlapping regions, while antibodies placed within each of the two groups are for the respective overlapping regions. The group III site appeared to be close to or overlapping the group I determinant but distinct from the group II region. Using the isolated monoclonal antibodies, we compared seven heterologous strains by HI and neutralization tests, as well as by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Monitoring the occurrence of sporadic or atypical pestiviruses is a useful approach to assess the need for additional vaccine strains that can be used in BVDV control programs. Results: In this study we developed a multiwell antibody ELISA based on the recombinant E2 protein of the three bovine pestiviruses. We evaluated the applicability of the assay for surveillance purposes using pooled milk samples, each prepared from up to 35 lactating cows and collected from 176 dairy herds. As expected, most of the pooled samples reacted to a higher extent against BVDV-1 E2 antigen. However, all three milk stocks from a single farm reacted to BVDV-2 antigen. Further analysis using spot tests, antigen detection and sequence analysis of the 5'-UTR region confirmed the presence of five persistently infected calves carrying a strain of BVDV-2a.

1521,Differential expression of porcine microRNAs in pigs infected with African swine fever virus: a proof-of-concept study,"Background: African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating and re-expanding viral disease that currently threatens the swine industry worldwide. MicroRNAs are a class of 17-25 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that have been shown to have critical roles in a wide variety of biological processes, including cell differentiation, cell cycle regulation, carcinogenesis, apoptosis, regulation of immunity, as well as in the viral response. infections by cleavage or translational repression of mRNA. However, there is no information on miRNA expression in ASFV infection. Methods: In this proof-of-concept study, we analyzed miRNAs expressed in the spleen and submandibular lymph node of pigs experimentally infected with a virulent (E75) or derived attenuated (E75CV1) strain of ASFV, as well as, at different time points later. -infection with the virulent strain, by high-throughput sequencing of small RNA libraries. Results: The spleen presented a more differential expression pattern than the lymph nodes in an ASFV infection. Of the most abundant miRNAs, 12 were differentially expressed in both tissues at two different times in animals infected with the virulent strain. Of these, miR-451, miR-145-5p, miR-181a, and miR-122 were upregulated late after infection, while miR-92a, miR-23a, miR-92b-3p, miR-126 -5p, miR-126-3p, miR-30d, miR-23b, and miR-92c showed downregulation. Of the 8 differentially expressed miRNAs identified at the same time post-infection in animals infected with the virulent strain compared to animals infected with its attenuated strain, miR-126-5p, miR-92c, miR-92a, miR-30e-5p and miR-500a-5p was upregulated while miR-125b, miR-451 and miR-125a were downregulated. All of these miRNAs have been shown to be associated with cellular genes involved in pathways related to the immune response, virus-host interactions, as well as several viral genes.

1522,Identification of microRNAs in pigs subclinically infected with PCV2 by high-throughput sequencing,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the essential etiologic infectious agent of systemic PCV2 disease and has been associated with other swine diseases, all collectively known as porcine circovirus diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression after transcription. miRNAs play an increasing role in many biological processes. The study of miRNA-mediated host-pathogen interactions has emerged in the last decade due to the important role miRNAs play in antiviral defense. The aim of this study was to identify the miRNA expression pattern in subclinically infected and non-infected PCV2 pigs. For this, an experimental infection with PCV2 was carried out and small RNA libraries were constructed from tonsils and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) of infected and uninfected pigs. High-throughput sequencing determined differences in miRNA expression in MLN between infected and uninfected, while a highly conserved pattern was observed in amygdala. In MLN, miRNA 126-3p, miRNA 126-5p, let-7d-3p, mir-129a, and mir-let-7b-3p were upregulated, while mir-193a-5p, mir-574-5p, and mir -34a regulated downward. Functional analysis prediction showed that these miRNAs may be involved in pathways related to the immune system and in processes related to PCV2 pathogenesis, although functional assays are needed to support these predictions. This is the first study on miRNA gene expression in PCV2-infected pigs using a high-throughput sequencing approach in which several host miRNAs were differentially expressed in response to PCV2 infection.",,"NÃºÃ±ez-HernÃ¡ndez, F.;PÃ©rez, L.

1523,African swine fever virus does not express viral microRNAs in experimentally infected pigs,"Background: African swine fever (ASF) virus is the etiological agent of African swine fever (ASF), a devastating and highly lethal hemorrhagic viral disease that is re-spreading. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression after transcription. The discovery of virus-specific miRNAs has increased in both number and importance in recent years. We have recently described the differential expression of various porcine miRNAs during in vivo infection with attenuated and virulent ASFV strains. Here, we have extended these studies by trying to identify the presence of ASFV-encoded viral miRNAs in an in vivo infection in pigs. Results: Sixteen small spleen and submandibular lymph node RNA libraries obtained from eight pigs, seven infected with the virulent E75 ASFV strain or its attenuated E75CV1 counterpart, or from pigs that survived E75CV1 infection and challenged with BA71 ( heterologous challenge) and one uninfected as a negative control. Samples were recovered at different times after infection. Libraries were analyzed by next generation sequencing. Initially, some viral miRNA candidates were identified, which did not correspond to porcine miRNAs. Further structural analyzes were carried out to confirm whether they met the conformational requirements to be considered a viral miRNA. Conclusions: Analysis of sixteen small RNA libraries prepared from two different tissues obtained from pigs experimentally infected with E75, E75CV1, or with E75CV1 plus BA71 revealed the presence of six potential miRNA sequences, but none of them met the requirements for infection. be considered as viral miRNA. .

The genus Teschovirus contains a single species Teschovirus A which currently includes 13 serotypes. In the present study, we identified novel PTVs that are distantly related to Teschovirus A and were found in fecal samples from pigs with and without diarrhea in Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid (aa) sequences of the entire coding region revealed that these newly identified viruses did not cluster with any PTV strains or other strains within picornavirus supergroup 1, suggesting that the viruses may not belong to the Teschovirus A or no genus. of the Picornaviridae family. These new PTVs share an internal type IV ribosomal entry site and retain characteristic motifs in the coding region, but show 62.2-79.0%, 86.6-92.8%, 77.1-81.0% and 84.3-86.7%. aa identities with the PTV strains in the P1, 2C, 3C and 3D regions, respectively.

This system enriches target virus nucleic acids in clinical/field samples by using a library of biotinylated RNAs with sequences complementary to the target viruses. The enriched nucleic acids are amplified by PCR and subjected to next-generation sequencing to identify target viruses. In many samples, the SureSelect target enrichment method increased the efficiency for detection of viruses listed in the biotinylated RNA library. Furthermore, this method allowed us to determine the near-complete genome sequence of swine parainfluenza virus 1 and to significantly increase the breadth, a value that indicates the proportion of the mapping consensus length in the reference genome, in pig samples.

We isolated the virulent strain of pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), PPMV1/Laughing Dove/Kenya/Isiolo/B2/2012, which had a characteristic (110)GGRRQKRF(117) fusion gene motif. We obtained a partial complete genome of 15,114 nucleotides. Phylogenetic relationship based on fusion gene and genomic sequence grouped our isolate as class II genotype VI, a group of viruses commonly isolated from wild birds but potentially lethal to chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus). The fusion gene isolate was pooled with PPMV-I strains from pigeons (Columbidae) in Nigeria. The complete genome showed a basal and highly divergent lineage with the American, European and Asian strains, indicating a divergent evolutionary path. The isolate is highly virulent and apparently species-specific for laughing pigeons in Kenya.

1530,Molecular evolution of human enteroviruses: Correlation of serotype with VP1 sequence and application to picornavirus classification,"Sixty-six human enterovirus serotypes have been identified by serum neutralization, but the molecular determinants of the serotypes are unknown. Since the picornavirus VP1 protein contains several neutralization domains, we hypothesized that the VP1 sequence should correspond to the neutralization (serotype) and thus to the phylogenetic lineage. To test this hypothesis and analyze the phylogenetic relationships among human enteroviruses, we determined the complete VP1 sequences of the prototype strains of 47 human enterovirus serotypes and 10 antigenic variants. Our sequences, together with those available in GenBank, comprise a database of complete VP1 sequences for all 66 human enterovirus serotypes plus additional strains from seven serotypes. Phylogenetic trees constructed from complete VP1 sequences yielded the same four main groups as published trees based on partial VP2 sequences; however, unlike the VP2 trees, in the VP1 trees the strains of the same serotype were always monophyletic. In pairwise comparisons of complete VP1 sequences, enteroviruses of the same serotype were clearly distinguished from those of heterologous serotypes, and the limits of intraserotypic divergence appeared to be approximately 25% nucleotide sequence difference or 12% nucleotide sequence difference. amino acid sequence. Pairwise comparisons suggested that coxsackieviruses A11 and A15 should be classified as strains of the same serotype, as should coxsackieviruses A13 and A18. Pairwise identity scores also distinguished between enteroviruses of different groups and enteroviruses from picornaviruses of different genera. The data suggest that VP1 sequence comparisons may be of value in enterovirus typing and picornavirus taxonomy by aiding in the assignment of unclassified picornavirus genera.",,"Oberste, M.

1531,Genomic evidence that simian virus 2 and six other simian picornaviruses represent a new genus in Picornaviridae,"Analysis of the VP1 capsid protein coding region of simian virus (SV) 2, SV16, SV18, SV42, SV44, SV45, and SV49 demonstrates that they are clearly distinct from members of the genus Enterovirus and from members of other genera. existing genera of picornaviruses. To further characterize this group of viruses and clarify their classification within the Picornaviridae, we have determined the complete genomic sequence of SV2 (8126 nucleotides). The genome was typical of members of the Picornaviridae, encoding a single open reading frame. The putative polyprotein contained typical picornavirus protease cleavage sites, producing mature proteins homologous to each of the known picornavirus proteins. SV2 contained an amino-terminal extension of the reading frame, which was analogous to the leader protein of members of the genera Aphthovirus, Cardiovirus, Erbovirus, Kobuvirus, and Teschovirus, but there was no significant amino acid homology to any of these known leader proteins. . . The 2A protein also misaligned with the 2A proteins of other picornaviruses. The deduced amino acid sequences of the SV2 structural and nonstructural proteins were related to but phylogenetically distinct from those of human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. The main distinguishing features of SV2 were the presence of a type 2 internal ribosome entry site at the 5â€²-NTR, a putative leader protein encoded upstream of the structural proteins, and an unusually large 2A protein. On the basis of molecular analysis, we propose that SV2, SV16, SV18, SV42, SV44, SV45, SV49, and porcine enterovirus 8 be classified as members of a new genus in the Picornaviridae and that SV2 (strain 2383) be designated as the strain type. . © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

1535,Characterization and distribution of a potyvirus associated with Woodiness disease of passion fruit in Uganda,"This article describes the incidence and etiology of a viral disease of passion fruit in Uganda. Symptoms, including those characteristic of passion fruit wood disease (PWD), were observed on 32% of plants in production areas. Electron microscopic observations of infected tissues revealed flexible filaments of ca. 780nm Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays indicated a serological relationship with cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CABMV) and passion fruit ringspot virus (PFRSV). In host range studies, only species in the families Solanaceae and Chenopodiaceae were susceptible, and neither Vigna unguiculata nor Phaseolus vulgaris were infected. The coat protein (CP) gene sequences of eight isolates exhibited characteristics typical of potyviruses and were highly similar (88 to 100% identity). However, the sequences had limited sequence identity with the CP genes of two of the three potyviruses that cause PWD: East Asian passionflower virus and passion fruit wood virus (PWV). The deduced amino acid sequences for CP from Ugandan isolates had the highest identity with bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV) (72-79%, with evolutionary divergence values between 0.17 and 0.19) and CABMV (73 to 76%, with divergence values between 0.21 and 0.25). Based on these results and in accordance with the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses criteria for species demarcation in the family Potyviridae, we conclude that a previously unreported virus causes viral diseases in passion fruit in Uganda.

1536,"Genomic associations of bovine viral diarrhea virus in outbreaks of mucosal disease, enteritis and generalized dermatitis in Argentina","The objective of this work is the description of the outbreaks caused by the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in commercial beef cattle farms in Argentina. Genetic affiliation and its association with clinical manifestation was performed with five BVDV isolates from an outbreak of mucosal disease (MD) (Outbreak #1), acute enteritis (Outbreaks #2 and #3), and generalized dermatitis (Outbreaks # 4 and #5). Following genetic analysis, the CP BVDV isolate from outbreak #1 clustered very closely with BVDV from Oregon (genotype 1). BVDV isolates from generalized dermatitis outbreaks (Outbreaks #4 and #5) were located close to BVDV Osloss within Genotype 1. Immunohistochemical identification of BVDV in exudative dermatitis indicates epithelial cell tropism of the virus. Phylogenetic characterization of BVDV from outbreaks #2 and #3 places them as BVDV-2. The 5-UTR sequence of these viruses revealed homology of 88 and 90% with BVDV-890 (genotype 2) and 77 and 75% with BVDV-SD1 (genotype 1), respectively. The association of BVDV-2 with severe disease indicates the presence of highly virulent strains. Data from natural outbreaks from which BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 were isolated revealed that pathology overlaps and does not clearly allow differentiation between genotypes based on gross or microscopic lesions. Therefore, for a definitive diagnosis, further virological and molecular studies are necessary. In addition, the results of this work focused on the origin and consequences of genetic variations of BVDV with respect to pathogenesis and suggest the association between the genotype and a defined clinical syndrome. © 2003 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"OdeÃ³n, A.

1537,"African swine fever virus Georgia 2007 with a deletion of the virulence-associated 9GL (B119L) gene, when administered at low doses, leads to virus attenuation in pigs and induces effective protection against homologous challenge","UNLABELED: African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the etiologic agent of an often fatal disease of domestic pigs. Disease control strategies have been hampered by the unavailability of African swine fever virus vaccines. Since its introduction into the Republic of Georgia, a highly virulent virus, ASFV Georgia 2007 (ASFV-G), has caused an epizootic that spread rapidly to Eastern European countries. There are currently no vaccines available or in development to control ASFV-G. In the past, genetically modified ASFVs harboring deletions of virulence-associated genes have been shown to attenuate in pigs, inducing protective immunity against challenge with homologous parental viruses. Deletion of the 9GL gene (open reading frame [ORF] B119L) in highly virulent ASFV Malawi-Lil-20/1 produced an attenuated phenotype even when administered to pigs at 10(6) 50% hemadsorption doses (HAD50) . Here we report the construction of a genetically modified ASFV-G strain (ASFV-G-DELTA9GLv) harboring a deletion of the 9GL gene (B119L). Like Malawi-Lil-20/1-DELTA9GL, ASFV-G-DELTA9GL showed limited replication in primary porcine macrophages. However, intramuscular inoculation of pigs with ASFV-G-DELTA9GL 10(4) HAD50 produced a virulent phenotype that, unlike Malawi-Lil-20/1-DELTA9GL, induced lethal disease in pigs like ASFV-G parental. Interestingly, lower doses (10(2) to 10(3) HAD50) of ASFV-G-DELTA9GL did not induce a virulent phenotype in pigs and, when challenged, protected pigs against disease. A 10(2) HAD50 dose of ASFV-G-DELTA9GLv conferred partial protection when pigs were challenged at 21 or 28 days post infection (dpi). An ASFV-G-DELTA9GL HAD50 of 10(3) conferred partial and complete protection at 21 and 28 dpi, respectively. The information provided here adds to our recent report on early experimental ASFV-G vaccine attempts. IMPORTANCE: The main problem for the control of ASF is the lack of vaccines. Studies on the virulence of African swine fever virus lead to the production of genetically modified attenuated viruses that induce protection in pigs, but only against challenges with homologous viruses. Here we produce a recombinant ASFV that lacks the virulence-associated gene 9GL in an attempt to produce a vaccine against virulent ASFV-G, a highly virulent virus isolate detected in the Caucasus region in 2007 and now spreading across the country. Caucasus region and Eastern Europe. Deletion of 9GL, unlike other ASFV isolates, did not completely attenuate ASFV-G. However, when administered once at low doses, recombinant ASFV-G-DELTA9GL induced protection in pigs against parental ASFV-G. Protection against ASFV-G is highly effective after 28 days post-vaccination, while at 21 days post-vaccination the animals survived the lethal challenge but showed signs of ASF. Here we report on the design and development of an experimental vaccine that induces protection against virulent ASFV-G.",,"O'Donnell, V.;Holinka, L. G.;Krug, P. W.;Gladue, D.

1543,Foot and mouth disease in Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus),"FMD is a highly contagious, debilitating and globally significant viral disease that typically affects cloven-hoofed hosts. The diagnosis of foot-and-mouth disease in bears in Vietnam is described. The current study describes a confirmed case of FMD in a bear species and clinical signs consistent with FMD in a sun bear. Thirteen Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) and 1 sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) were apparently affected. In August 2011, an adult bear became lethargic and developed blisters on its feet. Over 15 days, 14 of 17 bears developed similar signs; the remaining 3 bears co-housed and another 57 resident bears did not. All of the affected bears developed blisters on all their feet, and most were lethargic for 24 to 48 hours. Nasal and oral lesions were observed in 6 and 3 cases, respectively. Within 1 month, everything seemed normal. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, classified as serotype O, and isolated by virus isolation techniques. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the grouping of 3 bear isolates, in a distinct branch from other FMDV type O isolates. The outbreak likely occurred due to indirect contact with livestock and was facilitated by the high density of captive bears. It showed that Asiatic black bears are capable of contracting foot-and-mouth disease virus and developing clinical disease, and that the virus spreads easily between bears in close contact.",,"Officer, K.;Lan, N.

1544,Two new subfamilies of DNA mismatch repair (MutS) proteins specifically abundant in the marine environment,"MutS proteins are ubiquitous in cellular organisms and have important roles in DNA mismatch repair or recombination. In the virus world, the Mimivirus that infects amoebae, as well as the recently sequenced Cafeteria roenbergensis virus, are known to encode a MutS related to homologues found in octocorals and epsilon-proteobacteria. To explore the presence of MutS proteins in other viral genomes, we performed a genomic study of four giant viruses ('giruses') (Pyramiomonas orientalis virus (PoV), Phaeocystis pouchetii virus (PpV), Chrysochromulina ericina virus (CeV), and Heterocapsa circularisquama virus). DNA (HcDNAV)) that infect unicellular marine algae. Our analysis revealed the presence of a close homologue of Mimivirus MutS in all species tested. These viral homologues possess a specific domain structure, including a C-terminal HNH endonuclease domain, that defines the novel MutS7 subfamily. We confirmed the presence of conserved mismatch recognition residues in all MutS7 subfamily members, suggesting their role in DNA mismatch repair rather than DNA recombination. PoV and PpV were found to contain an additional type of MutS, which we propose to call MutS8. MutS8 proteins in PoV and PpV were found to be closely related to homologues from Candidatus Amoebophilus asiaticus, an obligate intracellular amoeba-symbiont belonging to Bacteroidetes. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that MutS7 and MutS8 are abundant in marine microbial metagenomes and that the vast majority of these environmental sequences are likely to be of gyrus origin. Thus, Girus appear to represent an important source of the underexplored diversity of the MutS family in the microbial world.

1545,Remarkable sequence similarity between the marine gyrus that infects dinoflagellates and the terrestrial pathogenic African swine fever virus,"Heterocapsa circularisquama DNA virus (HcDNAV; formerly designated HcV) is a giant virus (gyrus) with a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome of 356 kbp. HcDNAV lytically infects the bivalve-killing marine dinoflagellate H. circularisquama and currently represents the only DNA virus isolated from dinoflagellates, one of the most abundant protists in marine ecosystems. Its morphological features, genome type, and host range previously suggested that HcDNAV might be a member of the Phycodnaviridae family of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV), although no supporting sequence data were available. Currently, NCLDVs include two families found in aquatic environments (Phycodnaviridae, Mimiviridae), one that mainly infects terrestrial animals (Poxviridae), another isolated from fish, amphibians, and insects (Iridoviridae), and the last (Asfarviridae) represented exclusively by the animal pathogen African swine fever virus (ASFV), the agent of a fatal hemorrhagic disease in domestic pigs. In this study, we determined the complete sequence of the HcDNAV DNA polymerase type B (PolB) gene. Viral PolB was transcribed at least as early as 6 h post inoculation (hpi), suggesting its crucial role for viral replication. More unexpectedly, the HcDNAV PolB sequence was found to be closely related to the ASFV PolB sequence. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of HcDNAV PolB showed a rare amino acid substitution within a motif that contained a highly conserved motif: YSDTDS was found in HcDNAV PolB instead of YGDTDS in most dsDNA viruses. Coupled with the previous observation of ASFV-like sequences in the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling metagenomic datasets, our results further support ideas that terrestrial ASFV has its evolutionary origin in marine environments. © 2009 Ogata et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Ogata, H.;Toyoda, K.;Tomaru, Y.;Nakayama, N.;Shirai, Y.;Claverie, J.

1546,Complete genome and phylogenetic position of bovine papillomavirus type 7,"Six types of bovine papillomavirus (BPV) and 16 putative BPV types have previously been reported. Here, the complete genome sequence of BAPV6, a putative new type of BPV isolated from cattle in Japan, was determined by using multiple primed rolling circle amplification. The genome consisted of 7412 bp (G+C content of 46 mol%) encoding five early genes (E1, E2, E4, E6 and E7) and two late genes (L1 and L2), but did not encode the E5 gene. The E6 protein contained a nonconsensus CxxC(x)33CxxC and a consensus CxxC(x)29CxxC zinc-binding domain, and the E7 protein lacked the LxCxE motif. The nucleotide sequence of the L1 open reading frame (ORF) was most closely related (57-58%) to the L1 ORF of members of the genera Betapapillomavirus, Gammapapillomavirus, and Pipapillomavirus. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete L1 ORF suggests that BAPV6 should be classified in a new genus in the family Papillomaviridae as BPV-7. © 2007 SGM.",,"Ogawa, T.;Tomita, Y.;Okada, M.;Shirasawa, H.",2007.0,,10.1099/vir.0.82794-0,0

1549,Isolation of maedi/visna virus from a sheep in Japan,"Maedi/visna (MV) is a lentiviral disease of sheep caused by the maedi/visna virus (MVV). Although VM is prevalent in many countries, it has not been reported in Japan. However, in 2011, three sheep in northern Japan were reported to be seropositive against MVV antigen, indicating persistent MVV infection. In the present study, we isolated MVV from a sheep to confirm MVV infection and performed a genomic classification of the virus. Co-culture of leukocytes from a seropositive sheep with fetal goat lung cells resulted in the formation of syncytial cells and the amplification of a long terminal repeat sequence of MVV by polymerase chain reaction. The isolate was confirmed to be MVV, rather than caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus based on phylogenetic analysis of the gag gene sequence. Although the sheep was asymptomatic, nonpurulent meningitis and spinal cord demyelination were found. These were considered as early lesions associated with pathogenic MVV infection. Therefore, the present study showed that MVV is distributed in Japan. © 2014 Japan Society of Veterinary Sciences.",,"Oguma, K.;Tanaka, C.;Harasawa, R.;Kimura, A.;Sasaki, J.;Goryo, M.;Sentsui, H.",2014.0,,10.1292/jvms.13-0269,0
1550,Evidence for an antigenic shift among orbiviruses of the Palyam serogroup,"The genomic sequence of segments 2 and 7 of Japanese isolates of Palyam serogroup viruses isolated between 1985 and 2001 was investigated and analyzed phylogenetically in comparison with Australian and African isolates of the same serogroup. Nucleotide sequences of segment 7 were highly conserved in the Japanese isolates (95.1 to 100%) and between the Japanese and Taiwanese isolates (96.0 to 100%), whereas the identities between the Japanese and Taiwanese isolates and the Australian and African isolates were fairly conserved (84.2 to 100%). 92.0%). Phylogenetic analysis based on segment 7 revealed three groups based on geographic origin. As a result of the nucleotide sequence analysis of segment 2, which encodes a serotype-specific antigen, the Japanese isolates were classified into two groups based on genome length and nucleotide identities. Four of the nine Japanese isolates were classified in the same group as the K-47 prototype strain of Chuzan virus, and the remaining isolates were classified in the same group as D'Aguilar virus and Nyabira virus. Phylogenetic analysis based on segment 2 revealed two groups, the group containing Chuzan virus and the group containing D'Aguilar and Nyabira viruses. To examine the antigenic relationship between viruses classified in different groups, we performed a cross-neutralization test. KSB-29/E/01, isolated in 2001 in Japan, was neutralized by antiserum not only against D'Aguilar virus strain B8112 but also against Chuzan virus. These results indicated that the genetically and antigenically unique features of KSB-29/E/01 were attributed to genetic rearrangement of segment 2 between Chuzan virus and D'Aguilar virus.",,"Ohashi, S.;Matsumori, Y.;Yanase, T.;Yamakawa, M.;Kato, T.;Tsuda, T.",2004.0,Oct,,0
1551,Sequence analysis of an Asian isolate of canine minute virus (canine parvovirus type 1),"Canine minute virus (CVM), also known as canine parvovirus (CPV) type 1, is an autonomous parvovirus that infects domestic dogs worldwide and is responsible for clinical problems in neonates and pregnant bitches . MVC was preliminarily described to be both antigenically and genetically different from CPV type 2 that emerged later. However, much of the MVC remains unclear, as only a limited number of MVC isolates were available for study. MVC infections of Japanese and Korean dogs were studied epidemiologically in the previous study, and several MVC isolates could be cultured in vitro. In the present study, a nearly complete nucleotide sequence of a genome of the Korean MVC strain HM-6 was obtained and comparatively analyzed with those of the recently characterized American MVC strain GA3. The genome structure of strain HM-6 was similar to that of strain GA3 and showed 96.4% identity in nucleotide sequence. Each of the deduced amino acid sequences of NS1, NP-1 and VP1/2 showed 96.5%, 92.5% and 97.5% homology between the HM-6 and GA3 strains. When compared to other parvovirus species, the HM-6 strain was more closely related to bovine parvovirus (BPV) as described for the GA3 strain. These results suggest that MVC together with BPV can possibly be classified into a new clade in the Parvovirinae subfamily. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"Ohshima, T.;Kishi, M.;Mochizuki, M.",2004.0,,10.1007/s11262-004-7430-3,0

1553,Genetic characterization and classification of human and animal sapoviruses,"Sapoviruses (SaV) are enteric caliciviruses that have been detected in multiple mammalian species, including humans, pigs, mink, dogs, sea lions, chimpanzees, and rats. They show a high level of diversity. A SaV genome commonly encodes seven nonstructural (NS) proteins, including the RNA polymerase protein NS7, and two structural proteins (VP1 and VP2). We classified human and animal SaVs into 15 genogroups (G) based on available VP1 sequences, including three newly characterized genomes from this study. We sequenced the full-length genomes of a novel genogroup V (GV), a porcine GVII, and a GVIII SaV using long-range RT-PCR including newly designed forward primers located within the conserved motifs of putative NS3, and also RACE methods of 5â€². . We also determined the 5” and 3” ends of GV SaV sea lions and GXIII SaV canines. Although the complete genomic sequences of GIX-GXII and GXV SaV are not available, common features of the SaV genomes include: 1) ""GTG"" at the 5â€² end of the genome, and a short end (9-14 nt) 5â€²-untranslated region; and 2) the first five amino acids (M [A/V] S [K/R] P) of putative NS1 and the five amino acids (FEMEG) surrounding the putative cleavage site between NS7 and VP1 were conserved among chimpanzees, two from five genogroups of pigs (GV and GVIII), sea lions, canines and SaV humans. In contrast, these two amino acid motifs were clearly different in three SaV genogroups of porcine (GIII, GVI, and GVII) and bat. Our results suggest that several animal SaVs have genetic similarities to human SaVs. However, the ability of SaVs to be transmitted between humans and animals is uncertain.",,"Oka, T.;Lu, Z.;Phan, T.;Delwart, E. L.;Saif, L. J.;Wang, Q.",2016.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0156373,0

Those calves and their mothers were not vaccinated against rotavirus. One hundred and forty-two bovine rotaviruses were isolated in cultured MA-104 cells and detected by latex agglutination test. They were classified as 18 G6P[1] (11.2%), 53 G6P[5] (37.3%), 15 G6P[11] (10.6%), 12 G10P[5] (8.5%) , 42 G10P[11] (29.6%) and 1 G8P[11] (0.7%) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. A virus of serotype G8 was not typeable for the P genotype, suggesting a new type of bovine origin. Less common serotype G8 viruses were isolated from samples from farms in Niigata and Tokushima prefectures. The VP7 gene sequences of the two isolates exhibited a high degree of homology as well as previously reported G8 viruses with 93.3-98.8% identity of the deduced amino acids. A phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene of the two previously reported G8 viruses and 13 G8 viruses by the neighbor-joining method indicated that the two newly isolated G8 rotaviruses had a common origin and were assigned to a new disparate group. © 2002 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Okada, N.;Matsumoto, Y.",2002.0,,10.1016/s0378-1135(01)00445-x,0
1555,Isolation and characterization of a new type of rotavirus species A in sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps),"To estimate the risk of interspecies transmission of rotavirus species A (RVA) from exotic pets to other mammalian species, the prevalence of RVA in sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps) was investigated. RVAs were detected in 10 of 44 sugar gliders by semi-reverse transcription (RT) PCR. These viruses were classified as G27P[3] and G27P[36] genotypes, with G27 and P[36] being new genotypes assigned by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group. To characterize sugar glider RVA in detail, one strain, RVA/SugarGlider-tc/JPN/SG385/2012/G27P[36] (SG385-tc), was isolated. All genes of the strain were classified as new genotypes (G27-P[36]-I19-R10-C10-M9-A20-N11-T13-E17-H12). The enterotoxin domain in NSP4, which is important for diarrhea induction, was conserved between SG385-tc and previously reported mammalian strains, suggesting the potential of the RVA sugar glider to cause diarrhea in mammalian species. In fact, seven of nine suckling mice inoculated orally with 3.9 x 10(4) ffu of the SG385-tc strain had diarrhea and the diarrhea-inducing dose (DD50) of 50% of the SG385-tc strain in mice infants was 1.2 x 10( 4) ffu Our findings suggest that the RVA sugar glider is infectious and possibly pathogenic in other mammalian species.",,"Okadera, K.;Abe, M.;Ito, N.;Mitake, H.;Okada, K.;Nakagawa, K.;Une, Y.;Tsunemitsu, H.;Sugiyama, M.",2016.0,May,,0

Of the 4,550 samples collected, 226 influenza A virus isolates were obtained from domestic ducks, muscovy ducks, and chickens. Of these, 25 and 22 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAIV) H5N1 viruses were isolated from apparently healthy domestic ducks in live poultry markets and slaughterhouses in northern and southern Vietnam, respectively.

1558,Genetic variability and evolution of the hepatitis E virus,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the only member of the Hepevirus genus in the Hepeviridae family. HEV is transmitted primarily by the faecal-oral route, and waterborne epidemics are characteristic of hepatitis E in many developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, where sanitary conditions are suboptimal. Accumulating lines of evidence indicate that HEV-associated hepatitis also occurs domestically among individuals in industrialized countries, that there are animal reservoirs of HEV such as domestic pigs and wild boar, and that hepatitis E is a zoonosis. Based on the wide genomic variability among HEV isolates, HEV sequences have been classified into four genotypes: genotype 1 consists of epidemic strains in developing countries in Asia and Africa; genotype 2 has been described in Mexico and several African countries; HEV genotype 3 is widely distributed and has been isolated from sporadic cases of acute hepatitis E and/or domestic pigs in many countries of the world, except in countries in Africa; and genotype 4 contains strains isolated from humans and/or domestic pigs exclusively in Asian countries.

HEV is transmitted primarily by the fecal-oral route, and waterborne epidemics are characteristic of hepatitis E. Recently, there is a growing consensus that HEV-related hepatitis also occurs among people in industrialized countries that do not have a history of travel to endemic areas. Zoonotic spread of HEV has been suggested as human and porcine HEV strains are closely related genetically and experimental cross-species infection of porcine HEV to a chimpanzee and human HEV to pig has been demonstrated. This review describes the clinical, epidemiological, and virological characteristics of domestic HEV infection in Japan, the genetic relationship of Japanese human and swine HEV strains, and possible modes of HEV transmission, emphasizing that HEV should be considered in the diagnosis of acute or fulminant hepatitis of Etiology not A, not B, not C, even in patients who have not traveled abroad.",,"Okamoto, H.;Takahashi, M.;Nishizawa, T.",2003.0,,,0

Methods: 17 patients with sporadic acute hepatitis E attended between 2004 and 2012 were studied. A total of 243 packages of raw pork liver from regional supermarkets were analyzed for the presence of HEV RNA. Partial genomic sequences of human and porcine HEV isolates were determined and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Results: The HEV isolates recovered from the 17 patients segregated into genotype 3 (n=15) and genotype 4 (n=2), and 15 genotype 3 isolates further segregated into 3e (n=11) and 3b ( n=4). Pig liver samples from 12 (4.9%) of the 243 packages had detectable HEV RNA. The 12 porcine HEV isolates were grouped into genotype 3 (3a or 3b). Although no 3e strains were isolated from pig liver samples, two 3b pig strains were 99.5-100% identical to two HEV strains recovered from hepatitis patients, within 412 nt partial sequences. Conclusion: HEV 3e was prevalent among patients with hepatitis E. HEV RNA was detected in approximately 5% of pig liver sold as food. The presence of identical HEV strains between patients with hepatitis and pig liver indicated that pigs play an important role as reservoirs of HEV in humans in Mie.

1561,Application of antisense molecules to poultry production,"Antisense molecules, which are single-stranded nucleic acids complementary to a specific mRNA, target and bind to the mRNA, interfering with and preventing translation of the mRNA encoding a specific protein. Recently, in order to prevent antisense molecules from nucleases, phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, which were originally developed as nuclease-resistant alternatives to phosphodiester oligomers, and protein nucleic acids have been used. The antisense molecule delivery system is basically the same as the DNA delivery system. Traditionally, DNA delivery systems have been classified as viral vector-mediated systems and non-viral vector-mediated systems. As the importance of current methodology is attributable to the limitation of viral vector-mediated delivery, non-viral vector-mediated systems, especially synthetic DNA delivery systems, have become increasingly desirable. To stimulate the appetite of poultry, the possibility of applying antisense protein nucleic acids against leptin mRNA was discussed. Antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide against insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 mRNA successfully suppressed its hepatic gene expression in chicken. Protein synthesis of chick embryo myoblasts was reduced by antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide administration against myostatin mRNA, suggesting decreased protein degradation by antisense administration.",,"Okumura, J.;Kita, K.",2001.0,Dec,,0
1562,Distribution of gene segments of the pandemic virus A(H1N1) 2009 lineage in pig populations,"Swine influenza viruses (SIV) are important not only for pig farming, but also for public health. In fact, the A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic viruses [A(H1N1)pdm09] were derived from SIV. Therefore, timely characterization of locally circulating SIVs is necessary to understand the global status of SIVs. To genetically characterize SIVs circulating in Japanese pig populations, we isolated 24 SIVs of three subtypes (17 H1N1, four H1N2, and three H3N2 strains) from 14 pig farms in Japan between 2013 and 2016. Genetic analyzes revealed that hemagglutinin ( HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from 17 H1N1 and HA gene from an H1N2, A/swine/Aichi/02/2016 (H1N2), SIV belonged to the A(H1N1)pdm09 lineage. More importantly, all six remaining gene segments (i.e., PB1, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) of the 24 SIVs, regardless of HA and NA subtype, were also classified as belonging to A(H1N1)pdm09. . lineage. These results indicate that gene segments from the A(H1N1)pdm09 lineage are widely distributed in SIVs circulating in Japanese pig populations. Furthermore, the NA gene of A/swine/Aichi/02/2016 (H1N2) shared less than 88.5% identity from that of the closest relative A/swine/Miyagi/5/2003 (H1N2), which was isolated in Japan in 2003.

Despite efforts to control the disease through vaccination, prolonged ILT epidemics remain a threat to the poultry industry. Previous epidemiologic and molecular evidence indicated that outbreaks in the US are caused by vaccine-associated strains. In this study, polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of four regions of the genome were used to characterize 25 isolates from US commercial birds and backyard flocks. PCR-RFLP classified the ILT virus isolates into nine groups. Isolates from backyard flocks were classified into three separate groups. The ILT virus reference strain from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the vaccine strain of tissue culture origin (TCO) were classified into two separate groups. Twenty-two commercial poultry isolates were classified into four groups: one group, of six isolates, showed identical patterns to chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines; a second group, of nine isolates, differed in only one pattern from the CEO vaccines; a third group, of two isolates, differed in only one pattern from the TCO vaccine; a fourth group, of five isolates, differed in six and nine patterns from the CEO and TCO vaccines, respectively. The results obtained from this study clearly demonstrated that the majority of the commercial poultry isolates (17 of 22 isolates) were closely related to the vaccine strains. However, isolates other than the vaccine strains were also identified in commercial birds. © 2007 Houghton Trust Ltd.",,"Oldoni, I.;GarcÃ­a, M.",2007.0,,10.1080/03079450701216654,0
1565,Epidemiological study in single-species flocks from Poland reveals greater genetic and antigenic diversity of small ruminant lentiviruses,"Small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infections are widespread in Poland and circulating subtypes A1, A12, A13, B1 and B2 have been detected. The objective of this work was to extend the previous study based on the analysis of a greater number of animals from herds of a single species. Animals were selected for genetic analysis based on serological reactivity against a variety of recombinant antigens derived from the viral Gag and Env proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of subtypes B2 and A12 in both goats and sheep and subtypes A1 and B1 only in goats. Additionally, two new subtypes, A16 and A17, were found in goats. Coinfections with strains belonging to different subtypes within groups A and B were detected in 1 sheep and 4 goats from four herds. Although the reactivity of the serum samples against the recombinant antigens confirmed the immunological relationship between the Gag epitopes of different subtypes and the cross-reactive nature of the Gag antibodies, eleven serum samples did not react with antigens representing all the subtypes detected until now. the date in Poland, highlighting the limitations of serological diagnosis.

1566,Porcine B cells recognize epitopes that are conserved between the structural proteins of the American and European type porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.,"By screening phage display libraries with immune sera from experimentally infected pigs, porcine B-cell epitopes were identified in the open reading frame (ORF) proteins 2, 3, 5 and 6 of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. (PRRSV) European type. The sequences of all epitopes were well conserved in European-type PRRSV and even between European and American-type PRRSV. Consequently, sera from American-type PRRSV-infected pigs cross-reacted with European-type epitopes. Thus, this study showed, for the first time, the presence of highly conserved epitopes on the matrix protein and envelope glycoproteins of PRRSV. ORF5 and 6 epitopes localized to parts of proteins predicted to be hidden in PRRSV virions. In contrast, the ORF2 and 3 epitopes were localized to putative protein ectodomains. Due to the interesting localization, the sequence surrounding the ORF2 and 3 epitopes was subjected to more detailed scrutiny. A heptad motif, VSRRIYQ, was identified that is present in a single copy in ORF2 and 3 proteins; this arrangement is completely conserved in all available European-type PRRSV sequences. The VSRRIYQ repeat motif colocalized closely with one of the ORF2 epitopes and secondary structure modeling showed that this segment of the ORF2 protein could form an amphipathic helix. Interestingly, a virulence/attenuation-associated mutation of a US vaccine strain of PRRSV also localized to this ORF2 protein segment and affected the hydrophobic face of the predicted amphipathic helix. Further work is needed to determine whether these findings delineate a functional domain in the PRRSV ORF2 protein.",,"Oleksiewicz, M. B.;BÃ¸tner, A.;Normann, P.",2002.0,,,0
1567,Determination of the sequence of the complete open reading frame and the 5â€²NTR of the Paderborn isolate of classical swine fever virus,"The classical swine fever (CSF) epidemic in the Netherlands in 1997-1998 lasted 14 months, during which 429 infected and 1,300 at-risk herds were culled, at an estimated economic cost of US$2 billion. Despite the overwhelming scale of the epizootic, the strain of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) causing the outbreak has remained largely uncharacterized. The Dutch epizootic is epidemiologically linked to a small outbreak of classical swine fever in 1997 in Paderborn, Germany. Partial E2 and 5-NTR sequencing has shown that the Paderborn index isolate and several Dutch isolates taken during the 1997-1998 epizootic are virtually identical, confirming that the Paderborn isolate triggered the Dutch outbreak and further showing that this single isolate was stable. throughout the entire Dutch outbreak (reviewed above in [C. Terpstra, AJ de Smit, Veterinary Microbiol. 77 (2000) 3-15]). We determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5-NTR (by 5-RACE) and the complete open reading frame of the Paderborn isolate (GenBank AY072924). Our sequence was identical to the previously published 5â€²NTR and E2 partial sequences for the index isolates Paderborn 1997 and Dutch 1997 (Venhorst), confirming the identity of the virus we sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full open reading frame showed that Paderborn is genetically very different from common European laboratory reference strains. Neutralization studies showed that Paderborn is also antigenically very different from common laboratory strains such as Alfort 187. Paderborn is the only recent European field isolate of CSFV for which a complete sequence is available, and given the genetic and antigenic uniqueness of Paderborn, the Paderborn sequence can have practical effects. use for diagnosis and development of vaccine antigens. © 2002 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Oleksiewicz, M.

The aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of the Lawrence Livermore Microbial Detection Array version 2 (LLMDAv2) combined with whole genome amplification and sequencing for the detection of viral AEs in live attenuated vaccines and specific pathogen free (SPF) eggs. . We detected positive microarray signals for the endogenous avian retrovirus EAV-HP and several viruses belonging to the genus Alpharetrovirus in all SPF vaccines and eggs tested. We used a microarray probe mapping approach to assess the presence of intact retroviral genomes, which in addition to PCR analysis revealed that several of the positive microarray signals were likely due to cross-hybridization with EAV-HPDELTApol and ALV-E ev1, ev3 and ev6 loci sequences originating from the chicken genome. Sequencing of the vaccines on a MiSeq instrument verified the microarray findings and showed similar cross-hybridization.

1570,"Virologic and Serologic Surveillance of Human, Swine, and Avian Influenza Virus Infections Among Pigs in the North-Central United States","Influenza virus infection in pigs is both an animal and public health problem. As such, surveillance and characterization of influenza viruses in pigs is important to the veterinary community and should be part of human pandemic preparedness planning. Studies conducted in 1976/1977 and 1988/1989 showed that pigs in the US were commonly infected with classical H1N1 swine viruses, while human H3 and avian influenza virus infections were very rare. In contrast, human H3 and avian H1 viruses have been frequently isolated from pigs in Europe and Asia during the last two decades. From September 1997 through August 1998, we isolated 26 influenza viruses from swine in the north central United States at the point of slaughter. All 26 isolates were H1N1 viruses, and phylogenetic analyzes of the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein genes of 11 representative viruses showed that they were classical porcine H1 viruses. However, monoclonal antibody analyzes revealed antigenic heterogeneity among the HA proteins of the 26 viruses. Serologically, 27.7% of the 2,375 pigs tested had hemagglutination inhibitory antibodies against classical H1 swine influenza virus. However, of particular importance, seropositivity rates for avian H1 (7.6%) and human H3 (8.0%) viruses were substantially higher than in previous studies.",,"Olsen, C.

Genetic analyzes showed that this duck virus has the same classical human/swine/avian virus. genotype rearranged like H1N2 viruses that have been isolated from pigs and turkeys in the US since 1999. Phylogenetic analyzes of each gene segment further confirmed that Dk/NC virus is closely related to H1N2 isolates from domestic animals. In particular, Dk/NC is most closely related to a swine H1N2 virus that was also isolated in North Carolina. These two viruses and a phylogenetically defined subset of additional H1N2 porcine viruses share a common mutation in the Sb antigenic site on the hemagglutinin protein.

The pathogenesis of PPMV-1 infections in poultry is largely unknown. PPMV-1 is known to require a series of passages in chickens before it is adapted to gallinaceous birds. Material and methods: Changes in the PPMV-1 genome after serial passage in specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing. In addition, histopathological lesions induced by PPMV-1 in experimentally inoculated pigeons, chickens and turkeys were evaluated. Results: After six passages of PPMV-1 in chickens, 10 non-synonymous substitutions were found, including one (in the NP protein) that dominated the gene pool of the viral quasispecies. Histopathological changes induced by the post-passage PPMV-1 strain were more prominent than the changes induced by the pre-passage PPMV-1 strain and lesions were more intense in pigeons followed by chickens and turkeys. Conclusion: PPMV-1 is highly adapted to pigeons and passage through chickens results in the acquisition of new amino acids in the polymerase complex, which may alter the pathogenic potential of the virus.",,"Olszewska-Tomczyk, M.;Dolka, I.;ÅšwiÈ©toÅ„, E.;Åšmietanka, K.",2018.0,,10.2478/jvetres-2018-0059,0

Such cells may harbor novel viruses whose sequences are unknown or latent viruses that are only expressed after cell stress. MP-Seq is an unbiased and comprehensive method to identify such viruses and other foreign agents without prior knowledge of the nature of such agents. Here we demonstrate its utility as part of an integrated approach to identify and characterize potential contaminants within commonly used virus and vaccine production cell lines. Through this analysis, in combination with more traditional approaches, we have excluded the presence of porcine circoviruses in the ATCC Vero cell bank (CCL-81), however we found that a complete SRV-related betaretrovirus can be expressed in these cells. a factor that may be of importance in the production of certain vaccines. Similarly, insect cells are proving valuable for the production of virus-like particles and subunit vaccines, but can harbor a variety of latent viruses. We show that following MP-Seq of the Trichoplusia ni transcriptome (High Five cell line) we were able to detect a contaminating latent nodavirus and identify an expressed errantivirus genome.

1579,"Discovery of vector, parasite, blood meal, and microbiome patterns from mixed DNA samples of the Chagas disease vector Triatoma dimidiata","Chagas disease, considered a neglected disease by the World Health Organization, is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by more than 140 species of triatomine bugs in the Americas. In Central America, the main vector is Triatoma dimidiata, an opportunist that feeds on blood and inhabits domestic and jungle ecotopes. Given the diversity of interacting biological agents involved in the epidemiology of Chagas disease, having simultaneous information on the dynamics of the parasite, the vector, the vector's gut microbiome, and the blood-feeding source would facilitate the identification of key associated biotic factors. with the risk of transmission of T. cruzi. In this study, we developed a RADseq-based analysis pipeline to study mixed-species DNA extracted from the abdomens of T. dimidiata. To assess the efficacy of the method across spatial scales, we used a nested spatial sampling design that ranged from individual villages within Guatemala to major biogeographical regions in Central America. The information from each biotic source was distinguished with bioinformatic tools and used to assess the prevalence of T. cruzi infection and the predominant Discrete Typing Units (DTU) in the region, the genetic structure of the T. dimidiata population, gut microbial diversity and blood feeding. history. An average of 3.25 million reads were obtained per sample, with approximately 1% assigned to the parasite, 20% to the vector, 11% to bacteria, and 4% to putative blood meals. Using a total of 6405 T. cruzi SNPs, we detected nine infected vectors harboring two distinct DTUs: TcI and a second unidentified strain, possibly TcIV. Vector specimens were sufficiently variable for population genomic analyses, with a total of 25,710 T. dimidiata SNPs in all samples sufficient to detect geographic genetic structure at local and regional scales. We observed a diverse microbiotic community, with significantly higher bacterial species richness in infected T. dimidiata abdomens than in uninfected ones. Unifrac analysis suggests a common set of bacteria associated with infection, coexisting with the typical intestinal microbial community derived from the local environment. We identified vertebrate blood meals from five T. dimidiata abdomens, including chicken, dog, duck, and human; however, additional detection methods would be necessary to confidently identify blood meal sources from most samples.

The trees obtained show that the 12 strains of the hepatitis B virus can be classified into four subgroups that are not compatible with the conventional subtypes. We estimate the rate of synonymous (silent) substitution of hepatitis B virus to be 4.57 x 10-5 per site per year. Applying this rate to the phylogenetic tree, we estimate that duck hepatitis B virus diverged from a common ancestor at least 30,000 years ago, that woodchuck hepatitis virus and ground squirrel hepatitis virus split about 10,000 years ago, and that the hepatitis B virus split within the last 3,000 years. Because these virus divergence times are much more recent than those of the host species, it suggests that the hepadnavirus family evolved independently of host species divergence.",,"Orito, E.;Mizokami, M.;Ina, Y.;Moriyama, E.

Both primer combinations had comparable amplification efficiencies for all NA subtypes (1-9). A total of 115 virus strains, including field isolates and reference strains, were successfully amplified using these degenerate primer sets.

One strain (0.9%) produced different subtypes from both sequence reads, while the other (0.9%) was unable to assemble and subtype.

Bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) and equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), phylogenetically more closely related to foot-and-mouth disease virus, were explored as surrogates for foot-and-mouth disease virus in antiviral studies. Although no efficient cell culture system for BRBV has been reported so far, we show that infection of primary bovine kidney cells resulted in extensive but poorly reproducible induction of cytopathic effect (CPE). Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells, on the other hand, supported viral replication in the absence of CPE. Antiviral tests for ERAV in Vero A cells were developed using a viral RNA depletion assay and a CPE depletion assay; the latter with a Z' factor of 0.83. ±. 0.07. Next, the BRBV and ERAV models were used to assess the anti-FMD activity of two broad-spectrum antiviral agents, 2'-C-methylcytidine (2CMC) and ribavirin, as well as the enterovirus-specific inhibitor enviroxime. The effects of the three compounds in the CPE depletion (ERAV) and viral RNA depletion (BRBV and ERAV) assays were comparable. Similar to 2CMC, compound A, a recently discovered non-nucleoside FMD virus inhibitor, also inhibited replication of both BRBV and ERAV, while enviroxime lacked activity.

HPAI H5N1 was first reported in Bangladesh in 2007 and since then, 546 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE. The disease has apparently become endemic in Bangladesh. Spatio-temporal information on 177 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks that occurred between February 2010 and April 2011 in Bangladesh was analyzed, and 37 of these outbreaks in which isolated H5N1 viruses were characterized phylogenetically into clades. Three clades were identified, 2.2 (21 cases), 2.3.4 (2 cases) and 2.3.2.1 (14 cases). Clade 2.2 was identified throughout the time period and was widely distributed in a southeast-northwest orientation. Clade 2.3.2.1 appeared later and was generally confined to central Bangladesh in a north-south orientation. Based on a directional test, clade 2.2 viruses spread from southeast to northwest, while clade 2.3.2.1 spread from west to east. The magnitude of spread of clade 2.3.2.1 was greater relative to clade 2.2 (angular concentration 0.2765 vs. 0.1860). In both cases, the first outbreaks were identified as early outliers, but in addition, early outbreaks (one each) of clade 2.2 were also identified in central Bangladesh and in northwestern Bangladesh, at a considerable distance from each other. H5N1 avian influenza in Bangladesh is characterized by reported long-distance translocation events. This poses a challenge for disease control efforts. Greater enforcement of biosecurity and stronger control of movements between affected farms and susceptible farms, and better surveillance and reporting are needed.

1585,Epidemiology and molecular characterization of chicken anemia virus from native and commercial chickens in Taiwan,"Chicken infectious anemia (CIA) is a disease with a high economic impact on the poultry industry. Infected chickens are characterized by aplastic anemia and extreme immunosuppression, followed by increased susceptibility to secondary infectious pathogens and suboptimal immune responses to vaccination. Commercially available CIA vaccines are routinely used by breeders in Taiwan to protect their offspring with maternally derived antibodies. However, cases of CIA still occur in the field and little is known about the genetic characteristics of Taiwanese chicken anemia viruses (CAV). In this study, CAV DNA was detected in 72 of 137 flocks collected between 2010 and 2015. Among the PCR-positive samples, the coding regions of 51 CAVs were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene revealed that although most Taiwanese CAVs belonged to genotypes II and III, some isolates clustered into a new genotype (genotype IV). Furthermore, a Taiwanese isolate in this new genotype IV appeared to derive from a recombination event between viruses of genotypes II and III. Five Taiwanese CAV isolates were highly similar to the vaccine strains, 26P4 or Del-Ros. Taken together, these results indicate that CAV sequences in Taiwan are variable and that intergenotypic recombination has occurred between viruses of different genotypes. Furthermore, the vaccine strains could induce clinical signs of CIA in chickens.

1588,Genetic and epidemiological insights into the occurrence of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) in Asia and Africa,"Small ruminants are important components in the livelihood of millions of households in many parts of the world. The spread of the highly contagious disease peste des petits ruminants (PPR), which is caused by an RNA virus, PPRV, in Asia and Africa remains a major concern. The present study explored the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of PPRV through the analysis of partial sequences of the N gene and the F gene of the virus. The four PPRV lineages described above (I-IV) diverged from their common ancestor between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Among the four lineages, PPRV-IV showed pronounced genetic structuring throughout the region; however, the exchange of haplotypes between geographic regions, together with the presence of multiple genetic groups within a country, indicates the possibility of frequent mobility of diseased individuals in the region. The gradual decline in the actual number of infections suggests limited genetic variation, which could be attributed to effective vaccination practiced since the 1990s. However, the movement of infected animals through the region is likely to contribute to the spread of the disease. PPRV-IV.

1589,Time-dependent selection pressure in two arthropod-borne RNA viruses in the same serogroup,"Understanding the genetic basis of viral adaptation to taxonomically diverse groups of host species inhabiting different ecoclimatic zones is crucial to uncovering the factors that underpin the successful establishment of these infectious pathogens in new hosts/environments. To gain insight into the dynamics of non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitutions and the relationship between the two (Ï‰ = dN/.dS), we analyzed the full nucleotide coding sequence data of segment M, encoding glycoproteins of two negative-sense RNA viruses, Akabane virus (AKV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) that belong to the same serogroup. While AKV is relatively older and has been circulating in ruminant populations since the 1970s, SBV was first reported in 2011. Ï‰ was estimated to be 1.67 and 0.09 for SBV and AKV, respectively, and the estimated mutation rate of SBV is at least 25-fold higher than that of AKV. Given the different evolutionary stages of the two viruses, most of the mildly deleterious mutations were likely eliminated or maintained at low frequency in the AKV genome, while positive selection coupled with the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations could contribute to a so inflated mutation rate of SBV. Evolutionary distance (d) is nonlinearly and negatively correlated with Ï‰, but positively correlated with dN and dS. Taken together, the different patterns in Ï‰, dN, dS, and d between AKV and SBV identified in this study provide empirical evidence for time-dependent selection pressure.",,"Padhi, A.;Ma, L.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.019,0

1591,"Serological and molecular investigation of the prevalence of Aujeszky's disease in feral pigs (Sus scrofa) in the subregions of the Pantanal, Brazil","The feral pig (FS) originated from the domestic pig and is present throughout the Brazilian humid plain (Pantanal). Aujeszky's disease (AD) was confirmed serologically for the first time in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) in 2001; however, there was no viral confirmation. The objective of this study was to investigate antibodies against SuHV-1 in sera from feral pigs in the studied areas, detect SuHV-1 through PCR and classify the viral genome. Of the 218 animals sampled, 186 were analyzed by ELISA, resulting in 88 (47.3%) reactive samples. In the serum neutralization (SN) test, 57/179 (31.8%) samples presented antibodies against the AD virus (SuHV-1). Using nested PCR, 104 DNA samples were extracted for analysis and confirmed by the amplification of a glycoprotein B (gB) fragment in five samples. SuHV-1 was detected in 12 samples using primers for glycoprotein E (gE) and the viral genome was classified as Type I by partial ul44 sequencing. Amplification of SuHV-1 glycoprotein fragments in fetuses from seropositive sows indicates that vertical transmission contributes to maintaining SuHV-1 in a free-living feral pig population. The origin of AD in the feral pig populations of the Pantanal is unknown, however, the determination of viral latency, the vertical transmission of the antigen by the amplification of SuHV-1 glycoprotein fragments in the fetuses of seropositive sows and the typing of the genome contribute to the elucidation of the epidemiology of this disease in the wetlands of MS, Brazil. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",,"Paes, R.

1592,Skeletal and heart muscle inflammation of farmed salmon is associated with novel reovirus infection,"The mariculture of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) has been associated with epidemics of infectious diseases that threaten not only local production, but also wild fish that approach sea pens and fish that escape from them. Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is a frequently fatal disease of farmed Atlantic salmon. First recognized on a farm in Norway in 1999[1], HSMI was subsequently implicated in outbreaks on other farms in Norway and the UK[2]. Although pathology and disease transmission studies indicated an infectious basis, efforts to identify an agent were unsuccessful. Here we provide evidence that HSMI is associated with piscine reovirus (PRV) infection. PRV is a novel reovirus identified using unbiased high-throughput DNA sequencing and a bioinformatics program focused on nucleotide frequency as well as sequence alignment and motif analysis. Formal involvement of PRV in HSMI will require isolation in cell culture and compliance with Koch's postulates, or prevention or modification of the disease through the use of specific drugs or vaccines. However, as our data indicate that a causal relationship is plausible, steps must be taken to control PRV not only because it threatens domestic salmon production, but also because of the potential for transmission to wild salmon populations. © 2010 Palacios et al.",,"Palacios, G.;Lovoll, M.;Tengs, T.;Hornig, M.;Hutchison, S.;Hui, J.;Kongtorp, R.

(DE) syndromes: astrovirus, reovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and parvovirus. Turkey astroviruses were found in 83.67% of cases and turkey astrovirus 2 (TAst-2) in 26.53%. Investigations directly demonstrated the high prevalence of turkey parvovirus (TuPV) in 23 flocks (46.9%) showing signs of ED, making this the second most identified pathogen after astroviruses. Phylogenetic analysis on a 527 base pair region of the NS1 gene revealed two main groups, a chicken parvovirus (ChPV) and a TuPV group, but also the presence of a divergent branch of strains tentatively named ""TuPV-like ChPVs"". The 23 Hungarian TuPV strains were placed separately into two pools with the sequences of US origin in the TuPV pool. An AvaII-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay has also been developed for the rapid differentiation of TuPV, ChPV, and TuPV-like divergent strains of ChPV.

1594,Metagenomics-based detection and molecular characterization of viruses infecting cowpeas in Burkina Faso,"Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. (Walp)) is an annual tropical grain legume. Often referred to as ""poor man's meat"", cowpeas are one of the most important subsistence legumes grown in West Africa due to the high protein content of their seeds. However, African cowpea production can be seriously limited by viral diseases that reduce yields. While twelve viruses have been reported infecting cowpeas in Africa, so far only three of them have been reported in Burkina Faso. Here we used a virion-associated nucleic acid (VANA)-based metagenomics method to detect the presence of cowpea viruses from plants collected in the three agroclimatic zones of Burkina Faso. In addition to the three virus species infecting cowpeas that have been previously reported in Burkina Faso (cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus [Family Potyviridae], black cowpea mosaic virus - a strain of common cowpea mosaic virus bean - [Family Potyviridae] and cowpea mottle virus [Family Tombusviridae]) five additional viruses were identified: southern cowpea mosaic virus (genus Sobemovirus), two previously uncharacterized polerovirus-like species (Family Luteoviridae), one previously uncharacterized tombusvirus-like species (Family Tombusviridae) and one previously uncharacterized mycotimovirus-like species (Family Tymoviridae). Overall, potyviruses were the most prevalent cowpea viruses (detected in 65.5% of samples) and the South Sudanese area of Burkina Faso was found to harbor the highest degrees of viral diversity and viral prevalence.

1595,new porcine circovirus distantly related to known circoviruses is associated with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome and reproductive failure,"Porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) is clinically manifested by post-weaning multisystem wasting syndrome (PMWS), respiratory and enteric disease, reproductive failure, and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is an essential component of PCVAD, although its etiological role in PDNS is not well established. Here, a new circovirus, named porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3), was identified in sows that died acutely with clinical signs similar to those of PDNS. The capsid and replicase proteins of PCV3 are only 37% and 55% identical to those of PCV2 and bat circovirus, respectively. Aborted fetuses from PDNS sows contained high levels of PCV3 (7.57 × 107 genome copies/ml) and no other viruses were detected by PCR or metagenomic sequencing. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of sow tissue samples identified PCV3 antigen in skin, kidney, lung, and lymph node samples located in typical PDNS lesions, including necrotizing vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, granulomatous lymphadenitis, and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Further study of archived PDNS tissue samples that were negative for PCV2 by IHC analysis identified 45 of 48 that were positive for PCV3 by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and 60% of a subset were also positive for PCV3 by IHC analysis. qPCR analysis of 271 porcine respiratory disease diagnostic submission samples identified 34 PCV3-positive cases (12.5%), and detection of anti-PCV3 capsid antibodies in serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay found that 46 (55%) of the 83 samples tested were positive. These results suggest that PCV3 commonly circulates among US pigs and may play an etiologic role in reproductive failure and PDNS. Due to the high economic impact of PCV2, this new circovirus warrants further study to elucidate its importance and role in PCVAD.",,"Palinski, R.;PiÃ±eyro, P.;Shang, P.;Yuan, F.;Guo, R.;Fang, Y.;Byers, E.;Hause, B.

1599,Genetic diversity and phylogenetic analysis of the GP85 glycoprotein of ALV-J isolates from mainland China between 1999 and 2010: Coexistence of two extremely different subgroups in layers,"The avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J), first isolated in 1989, preferentially infects meat birds. However, layer flocks in China have experienced outbreaks of this virus since 2008. To understand the genetic diversity of ALV-J in Chinese layers, we compared and analyzed the GP85 gene sequences of 106 ALV-J isolates that were isolated between 1999 and 2010 in mainland China. The GP85 gene sequences of 41 layer isolates collected from 9 provinces of China between 2008 and 2010 belonged to two separate highly diverse subgroups and differed from the meat-type chicken isolates. Compared to all meat-type isolates from China, subgroup 1 contained exclusively current layer isolates and appeared to be dominant; all isolates in this subgroup exhibited gene diversity and many single amino acid mutations were present. In contrast, subgroup 2 viruses were perfectly conserved and shared high identity with the meat-type chicken prototype ALV-J strain HPRS-103. The two subgroups contained only two concurrent mutations at the same position. Furthermore, most of the isolates in Subgroup 1 had two additional glycosylation sites (at positions 101 and 191) compared to those in Subgroup 2.

Reports suggested a variable host response in goats and sheep and this host response with respect to microRNA (miRNA) expression has not been investigated. Here, miRNAs were sequenced and proteomics data generated to identify the role of differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) in PPR virus (PPRV)-infected sheep and goat lung and spleen tissues. In lungs, 67 and 37 DEmiRNAs have been identified in goats and sheep, respectively. Similarly, in the spleen, 50 and 56 DEmiRNAs were identified in goats and sheep, respectively. A total of 20 and 11 miRNAs were found to be common and differentially expressed in both species in PPRV-infected spleen and lung, respectively. Six DEmiRNAs-miR-21-3p, miR-1246, miR-27a-5p, miR-760-3p, miR-320a, and miR-363-were selected based on their role in viral infections, apoptosis, and cell switching. fold. Target prediction analysis of these six DEmiRNAs selected from the generated proteome data revealed the involvement of more genes in goat lung and spleen than in sheep. In gene ontology analysis of host target genes, these DEmiRNAs were found to regulate various signaling pathways of the immune response. It was noted that the pathways viz. T-cell receptor signaling, Rap1 signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, and DEmiRNA-driven B-cell receptor signaling were more perturbed in goats than in sheep. The data suggest that PPRV-induced miR-21-3p, miR-320a, and miR-363 might act cooperatively to enhance viral pathogenesis in sheep lung and spleen by downregulating several immune response genes.

Typhimurium is a wide host range serovar, but has also evolved into host-adapted variants (ie, isolated from a particular host, such as pigeons). Six Typhimurium strains from different phage types (defined by patterns of susceptibility to lysis by a set of bacteriophages) were analyzed using Illumina high-throughput genome sequencing. Results: Variations between strains were mainly due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with an average of 611 SNPs per strain, ranging from 391 SNPs to 922 SNPs. There were seven insertions/deletions (indels) involving full or partial gene deletions, four inactivation events due to IS200 insertion, and 15 pseudogenes due to early termination. Four of these inactivated or deleted genes may be related to virulence. Nine prophages or remnants of prophages were identified in the six strains. Gifsy-1, Gifsy-2, and phage residues sopE2 and sspH2 were present in all six genomes, while Fels-1, Fels-2, ST64B, ST104, and CP4-57 were variably present. Four strains carried the 90 kb plasmid pSLT which contains several known virulence genes. However, two strains were found to lack the plasmid. Furthermore, one strain had a novel plasmid similar to the plasmid pHCM2 of the Typhi strain CT18. Conclusion: The genome data suggest that the variations between strains were mainly due to the accumulation of SNPs, some of which caused gene inactivation. No single genetic elements were found that were common among host-adapted phage types.

The Astroviridae family contains two genera, Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus, which, to the best of our current knowledge, infect mammals and birds, respectively. However, a recent seroprevalence study indicated that people in contact with turkeys may develop serological responses to turkey astrovirus, and mink may have been infected with avastrovirus. These data suggest that the ""host species/astrovirus genus"" association should be leaky; however, mamastrovirus infection has not yet been reported in avian species. In this study, a novel astrovirus was identified by viral metagenomics and RT-PCR methods in 2 (11%) of 19 fecal samples collected from a wild carnivorous bird species, the European Roller (Coracias garrulus) from two breeding territories in Hungary. . The complete genome sequence of astrovirus Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 (KP663426) was 7025 nt long and had some unique genomic features, including an unusually long spacer between the subgenomic RNA promoter and the ORF2 initiation codon. Using BLASTp Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 had the highest aa identities 35%, 61% and 34% for MAstV 32 (JF713710, host: porcine), MAstV 23 (JF729316, host: rabbit), and unclassified porcine astrovirus ( JX684071) at ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2, respectively. The same Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 proteins had 25%, 66%, and 33% aa identities with the corresponding proteins from murine astrovirus (JX544743) as the closest strain. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis indicated that Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 represents the first member of a new species of mamastrovirus. The data suggest that both mammals and birds could have been exposed to mamastroviruses and avastroviruses, providing opportunities for cross-species infection and viral adaptation with cross-class astroviruses, especially in carnivorous animals.

A new passerivirus was identified in a diseased violet earwax beak using viral metagenomics and confirmed by RT-(q)PCR. The complete genome of the waxbill finch picornavirus strain/DB01/HUN/2014 (MF977321) showed the highest amino acid sequence identity of 38.9%, 61.6%, 69.6% in P1cap, 2Chel and 3CproDpol , respectively, with passerivirus A1 (GU182406). High viral load (6.58 × 1010 genome copies/mL) was measured in a cloaca sample and in the tissues (spinal cord, lung, and intestines) of two other affected finches.

1606,Enteric viruses detected by molecular methods in commercial chicken and turkey flocks in the United States between 2005 and 2006,"Intestinal samples collected from 43 commercial broiler flocks and 33 commercial turkeys from all regions of the United States during 2005 and 2006 were examined for the presence of astrovirus, rotavirus, reovirus, and coronavirus by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (PCR) and to detect the presence of astrovirus, rotavirus, reovirus and coronavirus. the presence of adenovirus groups 1 and 2 by PCR. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to better characterize the viruses and assess species association and geographic patterns. Astroviruses were identified in samples from 86% of chicken flocks and 100% of turkey flocks. Both chicken astrovirus and avian nephritis virus (ANV) have been identified in chicken samples, and both viruses have often been detected in the same flock. Turkey astrovirus type 2 and turkey astrovirus type 1 were found in 100% and 15.4% of turkey flocks, respectively. Additionally, 12.5% of turkey flocks tested positive for ANV. Rotaviruses were present in 46.5% of chicken flocks tested and 69.7% of turkey flocks tested. Based on the rotavirus NSP4 gene sequence, rotaviruses of chicken and turkey origin have been classified in a species-specific manner. Turkey-origin rotaviruses were also classified according to geographic location. Reoviruses were identified in 62.8% and 45.5% of chicken and turkey flocks, respectively. Based on the reovirus S4 gene segment, viruses of chicken and turkey origin were classified separately and were distinct from all previously reported avian reoviruses. Coronaviruses were detected in the intestinal contents of chickens, but not turkeys. Adenoviruses were not detected in any chicken or turkey flocks. Of a total of 76 chicken and turkey flocks tested, only three chicken flocks were negative for all viruses targeted in this study. Most flocks tested positive for two or more of the viruses and, in general, there was no clear pattern of geographic distribution of the virus. This study provides updated enteric virus prevalence data for the United States using molecular methods and reinforces that enteric viruses are widespread in poultry in the United States, although the clinical significance of most of these viruses remains unclear. .",,"Pantin-Jackwood, M.

1607,Periodic monitoring of commercial turkeys for enteric viruses indicates continued presence of astroviruses and rotaviruses on farms,"longitudinal survey for enteric viruses was conducted in intestinal contents collected from turkeys at eight commercial operations and one research facility using molecular detection methods. Gut contents were collected from turkeys prior to placement, and each flock was re-sampled at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks of age. Samples were examined for astrovirus, rotavirus, reovirus, and turkey coronavirus (TCoV) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and for adenovirus groups 1 and 2 by PCR. Rotavirus was the only virus detected prior to placement (7 of 16 samples examined). All commercial flocks were positive for rotavirus and astrovirus from 2 to 6 weeks of age, and most were intermittently positive up to 12 weeks of age, when the birds were processed. Of the 96 samples collected from birds on farms, 89.5% were positive for astrovirus and 67.7% for rotavirus. All flocks were negative for TCoV, reovirus, and group 1 adenovirus at all time points, and positive for group 2 adenovirus (hemorrhagic enteritis virus) at 6 weeks of age. All monitored flocks were considered healthy or normal by field staff. Turkeys housed in research facilities that had been empty for months and thoroughly cleaned had higher body weights and lower feed conversion ratios at 5 weeks of age compared to turkeys housed in commercial farms. Intestinal samples collected at 1, 2, and 3 weeks of age from these turkeys were free of enteric viruses. This report demonstrates that astroviruses and rotaviruses can be present in a turkey flock throughout the life of the flock. Comparison of infected birds with a group of turkeys that were negative for enteric viruses by the methods used here suggests that astroviruses and/or rotaviruses may affect production. The full impact on flock performance needs to be further determined.",,"Pantin-Jackwood, M. J.;Spackman, E.;Day, J. M.;Rives, D.",2007.0,,10.1637/0005-2086(2007)51[674:Pmoctf]2.0.Co;2,0
1608,Molecular characterization and typing of chicken and turkey astroviruses circulating in the United States: Implications for diagnosis,"Avian astroviruses were detected by reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction in intestinal contents collected from commercial chickens and turkeys throughout the United States between 2003 and 2005. Astroviruses were detected in birds from healthy and low-yielding flocks with or without enteric disease. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with sequence data from the polymerase genes (ORF-1b) of 41 astroviruses of turkey origin and 23 astroviruses of chicken origin. All currently available avian astrovirus sequence data and selected mammalian astrovirus sequence data were included in the analysis. Four groups of avian astroviruses were observed by phylogenetic analysis: turkey astrovirus-like virus type 1 (TAstV-1), turkey astrovirus-like virus type 2 (TAstV-2), both detected in turkeys; viruses similar to avian nephritis virus (ANV), detected in both chickens and turkeys; and a new group of astroviruses of avian origin (CAstV). Among these four groups, amino acid identity ranged from 50.1% to 73.8%, and was a maximum of 49.4% for all avian isolates compared to mammalian astroviruses. There were multiple phylogenetic subgroups within the TAstV-2, ANV, and CAstV groups based on 9% nucleotide sequence divergence. Phylogenetic analysis did not reveal a clear distribution by geographic region or date of isolation. Furthermore, no correlation was observed between the detection of a particular astrovirus and the presence of enteric disease or poor performance. On the basis of these data, a revision of the current taxonomic classification of avian astroviruses within the genus Avastrovirus is warranted.",,"Pantin-Jackwood, M. J.;Spackman, E.;Woolcock, P.

1609,Two oncogenes in avian carcinoma virus MH2: myc and mht,"The 5.2 kilobase (kb) RNA genome of avian carcinoma virus MH2 has the genetic structure 5'-delta gag (0.2 kb)-mht (1.2 kb)-myc (1.4 kb)- c(0.4 kb)-poly (A) (0.2 kb)-3'. delta gag is a partial retroviral core protein, mht and myc are cell-derived MH2-specific sequences, and c is the 3'-terminal retroviral vector sequence. The following results were obtained from the complete nucleotide sequences of the mht and myc genes in MH2. (i) delta gag-mht forms a hybrid gene with a contiguous reading frame of 2682 nucleotides ending with a stop codon near the 3' end of the mht gene. The 3'969 nucleotides of mht to the stop codon are 80% related in sequence to the onc-specific raf sequence of murine sarcoma virus 3611 (MSV 3611) (94% homologous at the deduced amino acid level). (ii) The myc coding region in MH2 is preceded by 181 nucleotides derived from the intron immediately upstream of the second exon of the chicken cell proto-myc gene, followed by an RNA splice acceptor site shared with the proto-myc gene, followed by an RNA splice acceptor site shared with the proto-myc, beyond which it is colinear up to a 3' stop codon and 40 non-coding nucleotides with the myc sequences of the avian retrovirus MC29 and the chicken proto-myc. Thus, myc forms, together with a 5' retroviral exon, a second MH2-specific gene. It is concluded that MH2 contains two genes with oncogenic potential, the delta gag-mht gene, which is closely related to the transforming delta gag-raf gene of MSV 3611, and the myc gene, which is related to the transforming gene of MC29. Furthermore, it can be concluded that cellular proto-onc genes, which on sequence transduction become viral onc genes, are a small group because among the 19 known onc sequences, 5 are shared by different taxonomic groups of viruses of which the mht/raf homology is the closest so far.",,"Papas, T.

In the past 10 years, influenza vaccine coverage has decreased both in the general population (from 15.7% in 2004-2005 to 11.7% in 2013-2014) and in the vaccine target population of individuals 65 years of age. (from 65.3% in 2004-2005 to 48.6% in 2013-2014) and is well below the expected minimum threshold (75%). The highest rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) were recorded during the 2004-2005 and 2009-2010 epidemics (peak incidence: 12.04″ and 13.28″, respectively). Both seasons were characterized by the introduction of new viral strains: A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) (a hemagglutinin-derived variant) and pandemic virus A/California/7/2009(H1N1) (a quadruple rearrangement of porcine origin) , respectively . Because antigenic matching between the vaccine and circulating strains was good in both seasons, vaccination may have prevented a significant proportion of cases. A different situation was observed during the 2011-2012 season, when ILI morbidity rates in individuals aged ‰¥65 years were between 1.5 and 6 times higher than those recorded during the other epidemics analyzed. The highest morbidity was due to the circulation during the 2011-2012 season of a variant similar to A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2) that presented a reduced genetic compatibility with the A(H3N2) strain included in the composition of the 2011 vaccine. -2012.

Therefore, the respiratory disease complex is the most serious disease affecting poultry and causes great economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide [3] (Murthy et al., 2008).

Although both viruses can cause febrile rhinopneumonitis, EHV-1 is the leading cause of abortions, paresis, and neonatal deaths in foals. The central lesion of these three conditions is necrotizing vasculitis and thrombosis resulting from lytic infection of the endothelial cells lining the blood capillaries. The initiation of infection in these lesions is likely to be due to reactivated EHV-1 from latently infected leukocytes. However, the host factors responsible for reactivation remain poorly understood. While vaccine development against these important equine viruses involving classical and modern approaches has been ongoing for more than five decades, progress, compared with other alpha herpesviruses of veterinary importance affecting cattle and pigs, has been slow.

Although intolerable for modern, high-producing livestock systems, the disease is not usually fatal and is often not a priority for control in many developing countries, which remain reservoirs for viral spread. Phylogenetic analysis of viruses circulating worldwide reveals seven major reservoirs, each requiring a tailored regional control strategy. Considerable commercial benefits accrue to countries that eradicate the disease, but in addition to requiring regional cooperation, achieving and maintaining this status using current tools requires a great deal of time, money, and effort. Therefore, a stepwise approach is needed that can provide interim benefits along the path to final eradication. Research is needed to understand and predict patterns of viral persistence and emergence and to improve vaccine selection. Better diagnostic methods and especially better vaccines could significantly improve control in both free and affected parts of the world. In particular, vaccines with improved thermostability and a longer duration of immunity would make control easier and less dependent on advanced veterinary infrastructures. © 2009 The Royal Society.",,"Paton, D.

1625,Genetic heterogeneity of Indian field isolates of FMD virus serotype O as revealed by partial sequencing of the 1D gene,"The 165 nucleotide sequence at the 3' end of the 1D gene, determined from RT-PCR amplified cDNA fragments, of 25 type O strains isolated from different parts/regions of India during 1987-1995 and the vaccine strain (R2/75) currently in use in India were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. An isolate from neighboring Nepal was also included in the study. The virus/field strains showed a high degree of genetic heterogeneity with each other, with the percentage of nucleotide sequence divergence ranging from 1.2 to 19.4%. The Indian strains were far removed (13.3-20.6%) from the exotic type O strains of O1BFS, O1K and O1Campos. The type O strains analyzed were classified into three genotypes based on the level of divergence observed in the nucleotide sequence. The type O vaccinia virus (R2/75) was >7% divergent (7.3-15.2%) from the field strains, revealing significant genetic heterogeneity (>5%) between the two. Phylogenetic analysis identified three distinct lineages, namely (i) lineage 1 represented by the exotic strains, (ii) lineage 2 represented by 25 of the field strains which were grouped into seven subgroups/sublines (2a-2g) , and (iii) lineage 3 represented by a single field isolate that shared the branch/origin with the vaccine strain. Lineage 2, which comprised 25 of the 26 type O field strains tested, was placed about the same distance from lineages 1 and 3 on the phylogenetic tree. The vaccine strain was closer to lineage 2 viruses. Although there was no specific distribution pattern of sequences in different geographical regions of India, subgroup 2f viruses/sequences appeared to be restricted to southern states. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence in the immunodominant regions 133-160 and 200-208 of the 1D (VP1) gene product showed that the two viruses in lineage 3 had unique amino acid residues at positions 138 (D), 139 (G), 144 (I) and 158 (A) in comparison with the rest of the strains, including the exotic ones. Comparison of amino acid residues at critical positions 144, 148, 149, 151, 153, 154 and 208 revealed similarity between the type O strains tested. The virus strains showed variation (V/L/I) at position 144. One field strain showed replacement of Q149â†'E and another of P208â†'L. Thus, the study revealed that populations of FMD virus type O circulating in India and causing disease outbreaks are genetically highly heterogeneous but related in the immunodominant region of the VP1 polypeptide, and there are more than one population of genetically distinct virus in almost all regions of the country. which is possible due to the movement of animals without restrictions in the country. The involvement of vaccinia virus in disease outbreaks was ruled out as field strains (excluding lineage 3) were phylogenetically distinct.

1626,Isolation of a bovine rotavirus with a 'supershort' RNA electrophoretic pattern from a calf with diarrhea,"rotavirus with a ""super-short"" RNA electropherotype was isolated from a calf with diarrhea and designated strain VMRI. Segments 10 and 11 of this rotavirus migrated more slowly than those of the bovine rotavirus strains NCDV, B641 and B223. The electrophoretic pattern of the VMRI strain was similar to that reported for rotaviruses with super short RNA electropherotypes from humans and rabbits. Northern blot (RNA) hybridization indicated that strain VMRI gene 11 was altered and migrated between gene segments 9 and 10. The subgroup of strain VMRI was shown to be subgroup I. Strain VMRI of bovine rotavirus was neutralized with antisera containing polyclonal antibodies against rotavirus serotype 6 (bovine rotavirus serotype I) strains NCDV and B641 and by ascitic fluid containing monoclonal antibodies directed at VP7 of rotavirus serotype 6. Strain VMRI was not neutralized by polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against rotavirus serotype 6. strain B223 (bovine rotavirus serotype II). Collective data on neutralization of strain VMRI with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies suggest that this virus is a member of the NCDV (serotype 6) group of rotaviruses (bovine rotavirus serotype I).",,"Paul, P.

1627,Characterization of the complete genomic sequences of the Cocal and Alagoas vesicular stomatitis viruses,"In Brazil and Argentina, vesicular stomatitis (VS) is caused by different viral strains serologically related to classic Indiana vesicular stomatitis virus (VSIV), namely VS Indiana-2 (VSIV-2) and VS Indiana-3 ( IVSV-3). Here we describe the complete genomic sequences and organization of prototype strains of VSIV-2 Cocal virus (COCV) and VSIV-3 Alagoas virus (VSAV). These viruses showed similar genomic organizations to VSIV field isolates except that nonstructural C'/C proteins, highly conserved in all vesiculoviruses, were absent in VSAV.

1628,Genetic and antigenic relationships of vesicular stomatitis viruses from South America.,"Vesicular stomatitis (VS) viruses have been classified into two serotypes: New Jersey (VSNJV) and Indiana (VSIV). Here, we have characterized field isolates causing vesicular stomatitis in Brazil and Argentina over a 35-year span. Cluster analysis based on serological relatedness, as inferred from virus neutralization and complement fixation assays, or on the nucleotide sequences of two separate genes (phosphoprotein or glycoprotein) grouped the field isolates into two distinct monophyletic groups. within the Indiana serogroup. One group included seven viruses from Brazil and Argentina that were serologically classified as Indiana-2 and Cocal virus (COCV). The other group contained three viruses from Brazil that were serologically classified as Indiana-3 and the prototype of this group, the Alagoas virus (VSAV). Interestingly, two vesiculoviruses that were isolated from insects but do not cause disease in animals, one from Brazil (Maraba virus; MARAV) and the other from Colombia (CoAr 171638), clustered into two separate genetic lineages within the Indiana serotype. Our data support the classification of the viruses that cause clinical VS in cattle in Brazil and Argentina into two distinct groups: Indiana-2 (VSIV-2) and Indiana-3 (VSIV-3). We suggest using a nomenclature for these viruses that includes serotype, year and place of occurrence, and affected host.

1629,Zoonotic hepatitis E: animal reservoirs and emerging risks,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is responsible for enterically transmitted acute hepatitis in humans with two distinct epidemiological patterns. Large waterborne epidemics with thousands of people affected have been observed in endemic regions, whereas sporadic cases have been described in non-endemic regions. Although contaminated water has been well documented as a source of infection in endemic regions, modes of transmission in non-endemic regions are much less well understood. HEV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that is classified in the family Hepeviridae with at least four known major genotypes (1-4) of mammalian HEVs and one avian HEV. HEV is unique among known hepatitis viruses in that it has an animal reservoir. Unlike humans, HEV-infected pigs and other mammalian animal species generally remain asymptomatic, while avian HEV-infected chickens can develop a disease known as hepatitis-splenomegaly syndrome. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 are found exclusively in humans, while genotypes 3 and 4 are found in both humans and other mammals. Several lines of evidence indicate that, in some cases involving HEV genotypes 3 and 4, animal-to-human transmissions occur. Also, people who have direct contact with animals are at increased risk of HEV infection. Cross-species infections with HEV genotypes 3 and 4 have been demonstrated experimentally. However, not all sources of human infections have been identified so far, and in many cases, the origin of HEV infection in humans is unknown. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2010.",,"Pavio, N.;Meng, X.

1632,Limited evidence for transhemispheric movement of avian influenza viruses among contemporary isolates from North American shorebirds.,"The migratory routes of gulls, terns, and shorebirds (Charadriiformes) are known to cross hemispheric boundaries and intersect with areas of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks. Previous assessments of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) among species of this taxonomic order found some evidence of transhemispheric movement of viral genes. To specifically clarify the role of shorebird species in the transhemispheric movement of influenza viruses, assess the temporal variation of previously observed Eurasian lineages among North American shorebirds, and assess the need for continued sampling of these birds for HPAI in North America, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of >700 contemporaneous sequences isolated between 2000 and 2008. Evidence for transhemispheric redistribution among North American shorebird LPAI gene segments was less (0.88 %) than previous evaluations and occurred only among isolates from eastern North America. Furthermore, half of the rearrangement events occurred in only two isolates. The unique phylogenetic placement of these samples suggests secondary infection or the involvement of other migratory species, such as gulls. Eurasian lineages observed in North American shorebirds before 2000 were not detected among contemporary samples, suggesting temporal variation of LPAI lineages.",,"Pearce, J. M.;Ramey, A. M.;Ip, H.

1633,Viral Recombination Blurs Taxonomic Lines: Examining Single-Stranded DNA Viruses in a Wastewater Treatment Plant,"Understanding the structure and dynamics of microbial communities, especially those of economic interest, is of paramount importance in maintaining healthy and efficient microbial communities on agricultural sites and large industrial farms, including bioprocessors. Wastewater treatment plants are large bioprocessors that receive water from multiple sources, becoming reservoirs for the collection of many viral families that infect a wide range of hosts. To screen this complex collection of viruses, complete genomes of circular ssDNA viruses were isolated from a wastewater treatment facility by a combination of sucrose gradient size selection and rolling circle amplification and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Single-stranded DNA viruses are among the least understood groups of microbial pathogens due to genomic biases and cultivation difficulties, particularly when compared to the larger and more frequently studied dsDNA viruses. However, the group contains several notable well-studied examples, including agricultural pathogens that infect both livestock and crops (Circoviridae and Geminiviridae), and model organisms for genetics and evolution studies (Microviridae). Examination of the collected viral DNA provided evidence for 83 unique genotypic groupings, which were genetically different from known viral types and exhibited wide diversity within the community. Furthermore, although these genomes express similarities to known viral families, such as Circoviridae, Geminiviridae, and Microviridae, many are so divergent that they may represent new taxonomic groups. This study demonstrated the efficacy of the protocol in separating large bacteria and viruses from the sought after ssDNA viruses and the ability to use this protocol to obtain an in-depth analysis of the diversity within this group.",,"Pearson, V.

A serological procedure to subtype the NA glycoprotein is essential for the identification and classification of avian influenza (AI) viruses. The macroprocedure was first described in 1961 by D. Aminoff et al. [2] and was later modified to a microtiter plate (micro-NI) procedure by Van Deusen et al. [4]. The micro-NI procedure reduces the number of reagents needed, allows antigenic classification of many isolates simultaneously, and eliminates spectrophotometric interpretation of results. Although the macro-NI has been shown to be more sensitive than the micro-NI, the micro-NI test is well suited to testing sera for the presence of NA antibodies and has proven to be a practical and rapid method for virus classification. .

Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analyzes were performed on a 1195 base genomic segment that composes the 3″ region of the matrix protein (M) gene and a 5″ portion of the fusion protein gene (F), including the MF intergenic region. This encompasses coding sequences for the M protein nuclear localization signal and the F protein cleavage activation site. A dibasic amino acid motif was present at the predicted F protein cleavage activation site in all v-NDV, including isolates from California 2002-2003, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Mexico, and Central America. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that viruses from 2002-2003 California, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas were most closely related to isolates from Mexico and Central America. An isolate from Texas obtained during 2003 appeared to represent a separate introduction of v-NDV into the United States, as this virus was even more closely related to the Mexico 2000 isolates than to viruses from California, Arizona, and Nevada.

Improvements in the Multiplex molecular diagnosis of respiratory infections -thanks to the AH1N1pdm2009 Influenza pandemic- showed that rhinoviruses may be involved in severe forms. The risk of a resurgence of polio in Europe, after an 11-year elimination period, is a serious threat, due to the circulation of wild-type poliovirus in the Middle East and Africa due to conflict, population displacement and poverty . The current widespread epidemics of hand-foot-and-mouth disease and/or enterovirus 71 meningitis infections, with fatal encephalitis and cardiopulmonary failure, are clear evidence of its occurrence in Southeast Asia. Although rare in Europe and less frequently implicated than coxsackieviruses A6 and A10 in hand-foot-and-mouth disease, EV71 represents a real risk for the future.

1639,The origin of the new avian influenza a (H7N9) and the mutation dynamics of its transmissibility from person to person,"In February 2013, H7N9 (A/H7N9/2013-China), a new avian influenza virus, broke out in eastern China, killing people. It is a world priority to discover its origin and the moment in which it will become transmissible between humans. We present here an interdisciplinary method to trace the origin of the H7N9 virus in China and to model the evolutionary dynamics for its human-to-human transmission through mutations. After comparing influenza viruses from China since 1983, we established an evolutionary phylogenetic tree of the A/H7N9/2013-China virus and found that human cases of virus infection were of avian origin and clustered in an independent lineage. By comparing the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene sequences of A/H7N9/2013-China viruses with all human-to-human, avian, and swine influenza viruses in China in the past 30 years, we found that A/H7N9/ 2013: the viruses in China originated from the 2010 Hu Nan Province Baer Pochard H7N1 virus (HA gene, EPI: 370846, similarity to H7N9 is 95.5%) and the 2000 Nanchang City duck influenza virus (NA gene, EPI: 387555, similarity to H7N9 is 95.5%). 97%) through genetic rearrangement. Comparison of HA and NA gene sequences indicated that the A/H7N9/2013-China virus was not similar to influenza viruses transmissible from person to person. To simulate the evolutionary dynamics required for human-to-human transmission mutations of the H7N9 virus, we employ the Markov model. The result of this calculation indicated that the virus would acquire properties for human-to-human transmission in 11.3 years (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.2-11.3, HA gene). © 2014 Peng et al.",,"Peng, J.;Yang, H.;Jiang, H.;Lin, Y.

1641,Maedi-visna virus infection in sheep: a review,"Maedi-visna virus (MVV) is classified as a lentivirus of the retroviridae family. The MVV genome includes three genes: gag, which encodes group-specific antigens; pol, which encodes reverse transcriptase, integrase, RNase H, protease, and dUTPase; and env, the gene that encodes the surface glycoprotein responsible for receptor binding and virus entry into its host cell. Furthermore, analogous to other lentiviruses, the genome contains genes for regulatory proteins, ie, vif, rev, and tat. The coding regions of the genome are flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs) that play a crucial role in viral genome replication and provide binding sites for cellular transcription factors. The organs targeted by MVV are, in descending order of importance, the lungs, the mammary glands, the joints, and the brain. In these organs, the virus replicates in mature macrophages and induces slowly progressive inflammatory lesions containing B and T lymphocytes. Clinical signs of MVV infection, i.e., dyspnea, weight loss, mastitis, and arthritis, are related to location of these lesions. MVV infection induces the formation of antibodies that can be detected by agar gel immunodiffusion, ELISA, and serum neutralization assay. As neither antiviral treatment nor vaccination is available, diagnostic testing is the backbone of most schemes put in place to prevent the spread of MVV. However, since current serological assays still lack sensitivity and specificity, molecular biology methods are being developed that allow virus detection in blood, milk, and peripheral tissue samples. Future research should focus both on the development of new diagnostic tests and on a better understanding of the pathogenesis of MVV infection.",,"PÃ©pin, M.;Vitu, C.;Russo, P.;Mornex, J.

The most recent reports are from an outbreak in commercial birds in Chile in 2002 and its putative ancestor from a wild bird in Bolivia in 2001. Extensive surveillance in wild birds was carried out in Argentina during 2006-2007. Using RRT-PCR, 12 positive detections of IA were made from cloacal swabs. One of those positive samples yielded an avian influenza virus isolated from a wild Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) captured off the South Atlantic coast of Argentina. Further characterization by nucleotide sequencing reveals that it belongs to the H13N9 subtype. Phylogenetic analysis of the 8 viral genes suggests that the 6 internal genes are related to the isolates from Chile and Bolivia. The analysis also indicates that a group of phylogenetically related avian influenza viruses from South America may have evolved independently, with minimal gene exchange, from influenza viruses elsewhere.

1645,Hepatitis E: an emerging disease,"Currently, infection by the hepatitis E virus represents the most frequent cause of acute hepatitis and jaundice in the world. According to WHO estimates, about two billion people, representing a third of the world's population, live in areas endemic for HEV and are therefore at risk of infection. In developed countries, the circulation of the virus has been confirmed in both human and animal wastewater (pigs, wild boars, deer); however, the incidence rate is low compared to that of developing countries where outbreaks of acute hepatitis transmitted by the fecal-oral route originate, more frequently during times of flooding or after natural disasters, combined with poor sanitary conditions. Currently 4 HEV genotypes are known. Genotypes 1 and 2 are isolated in all human epidemic outbreaks in developing countries, while genotypes 3 and 4 are isolated not only in humans but also in animals, both in developing and industrialized countries. These data support that genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic in nature. The diagnosis of this disease is based on the detection of anti-HEV IgG and IgM in blood serum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. However, the method that best confirms the diagnosis is RT-PCR, which detects HEV RNA in blood serum and also provides the genotype. The clinical course is generally that of acute hepatitis that in some cases may require hospitalization and that, in transplant patients or HIV-infected patients, can become chronic hepatitis. In addition, the virus poses a significant risk to pregnant women. Hepatitis E can present a wide range of symptoms, from a subclinical case to chronic liver disease with extrahepatic manifestations. For this reason, diagnosis is challenging if a differential diagnosis is not included. There is no specific antiviral drug for hepatitis E, but satisfactory results have been observed in some patients treated with pegylated interferon alfa2a and/or ribavirin.

In the present study we molecularly characterized the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of eleven H5N1 viruses isolated from domestic poultry in Israel and Gaza in March-April 2006. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA and NA genes showed that Israeli and Gazan gene viruses were closely related to viruses isolated in Egypt in 2006. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Perk, S.;Banet-Noach, C.;Golender, N.;Simanov, L.;Rozenblut, E.;Nagar, S.;Pokamunski, S.;Pirak, M.;Tendler, Y.;GarcÃ­a, M.;Panshin, A.",2007.0,,10.1007/s11262-007-0120-1,0
1648,"Phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and nucleoprotein genes of H9N2 avian influenza viruses isolated in Israel during the 2000-2005 epizootic","The first two isolates of the H9N2 influenza virus in Israel were obtained from turkey and chicken hosts in May 2000. The actual epizootic of the H9N2 virus began in December 2001, after a silent period of one and a half years, and still going on. A total of more than 500 isolates from turkeys and chickens were recorded during the outbreaks. The present study has revealed some genetic peculiarities among the local isolates, namely: all the isolates belong to the same phylogenetic lineage type G1, within which they form a single group, which in turn is divided into three subgroups in the cases of genes HA and NP, and two subgroups in the case of the NA gene.

1649,Henipavirus receptor tropism and usage,"Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses are the deadliest human pathogens within the Paramyxoviridae family, which includes human and animal pathogens of global biomedical importance. NiV and HeV infections cause respiratory and brain diseases with high mortality rates in humans. Henipaviruses (HNV) are the only paramyxoviruses classified as biosafety level 4 (BSL4) pathogens due to their extreme pathogenicity, bioterrorism potential, and lack of licensed vaccines and treatments. HNV uses ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3, highly conserved proteins, as receptors for viral entry. This likely explains its unusually broad species tropism and also provides opportunities to study how receptor usage, cell tropism, and end-organ pathology relate to the pathobiology of HNV infections. The clinical and pathologic manifestations of NiV and HeV virus infections are reviewed in the chapters by Wong et al. and Geisbert et al. in this issue. Here, we will review the biology of HNV receptors and how receptor usage relates to HNV cell tropism in vitro and in vivo. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Pernet, O.;Wang, Y.

1650,Biological and phylogenetic characterization of the virulent Newcastle disease virus circulating in Mexico,"In 2002-2003, velogenic outbreaks of Newcastle disease virus, closely related to Mexican isolates, were confirmed in the United States (USA) in southern California, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas. In this report, virulent NDVs isolated in Mexico between 1998 and 2006 were subjected to biological characterization using standard pathogenicity tests and phylogenetic analysis. Chick embryo mean death time (MDT) test results ranged from 39.7 to 61.5 hours, and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) values ranged from 1.59 to 1.94, in comparison with a maximum possible value of 2.0. These isolates showed a dibasic amino acid motif in the fusion protein cleavage site sequence required for systemic host replication. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Mexican virulent NDV belong to class II, genotype V and can be clearly divided into two groups as follows: isolates from 1998 to 2001 with a close epidemiological relationship with the last NDV outbreaks in the US and phylogenetically distinct viruses, isolated from 2004 to 2006, which showed greater virulence. Evaluation of the evolution of viruses from Mexico and other neighboring countries will aid US surveillance efforts for early detection of highly virulent NDV.",,"Perozo, F.;Merino, R.;Afonso, C.

1651,Antigen-specific cell-mediated immune response in mice is suppressed by infection with pathogenic lyssaviruses,"cell responsiveness (RTC) was studied in BALB/c mice infected intramuscularly with various lyssaviruses. Following infection by this peripheral route, two types of viruses could be classified according to their effects: 1) pathogenic viruses, including fixed Pasteur rabies virus (serogenotype 1) and wild type 1 viruses (from a rabid fox in France and from a cow infected by a vampire bat in Brazil) or to serogenotype 5 (European bat lyssavirus 1); and 2) nonpathogenic viruses, including Mokola virus (serogenotype 3). RTC was tested by testing in vitro the ability of splenic T cells from infected BALB/c mice to produce cytokines after antigenic (purified lyssavirus antigens) or polyclonal (concanavalin A) stimulation. Cytokine production was followed by analyzing the biological activity of interleukin-2 and by analyzing interleukin-2, interleukin-4, and interferon-Î³ (IL2, IL4, and IFNÎ³) messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by transcription into complementary DNA and amplification by the polymerase. chain reaction. Initial production of biologically active IL2 and cytokine mRNA was observed in mice infected with pathogenic or non-pathogenic lyssaviruses. Only symptomatic mice (infected with pathogenic viruses) lost the ability to produce cytokines in vitro after antigen-specific stimulation. No such loss was observed after polyclonal stimulation. In mice peripherally infected with nonpathogenic viruses, no loss was observed after stimulation with lyssavirus antigens. Thus, peripheral infection with pathogenic lyssaviruses induces loss of T cell responsiveness in BALB/c mice after antigen activation, but not after polyclonal activation.",,"Perrin, P.;Tino De Franco, M.;Jallet, C.;Fouque, F.;Morgeaux, S.;Tordo, N.;Colle, J.

1652,Conserved presence of G-quadruplex-forming sequences in the Lentivirus long terminal repeat promoter,"quadruplexes (G4) are nucleic acid secondary structures that epigenetically regulate cellular processes. In human immunodeficiency lentivirus 1 (HIV-1), dynamic G4s are found in the unique viral LTR promoter. Folding of HIV-1 LTR G4s inhibits viral transcription; stabilization by G4 ligands enhances this effect. Cellular proteins modulate viral transcription by inducing/unfolding LTR G4. Here we extend our investigation on the presence of LTR G4 to all lentiviruses. The G4s in the U3 5'-LTR region were completely conserved in primate lentiviruses. A G4 was also present in a lentivirus that infects cattle. All other non-primate lentiviruses showed less stable G4 cues. In primate lentiviruses, the ability to fold at G4 was highly conserved between strains. G4 LTR sequences were highly similar among phylogenetically related primate viruses, while increasingly differing in viruses that diverged early from a common ancestor. A strong correlation was found between the G4s and Sp1/NFÎºB LTR binding sites of primate lentiviruses. All G4 LTRs were folded: their complexity was assessed by polymerase stop assay. Our data support the role of the lentivirus G4 5'-LTR region as a viral transcriptional control center, where G4 folding/unfolding and multiple recruitment of factors based on both sequence and structure can take place. .",,"Perrone, R.;Lavezzo, E.;PalÃ¹, G.;Richter, S.

1653,Comparison and Contrast of Genes and Biological Pathways Responding to Marek's Disease Virus Infection Using Allele-Specific Expression and Differential Expression in Broilers and Layers,"Background: Marek's disease (MD) is a commercially important neoplastic disease of chickens caused by Marek's disease virus (MDV), a naturally occurring oncogenic alphaherpesvirus. Improving genetic resistance to MD is desirable to augment current vaccines and other MD control measures. High-throughput sequencing was used to profile the splenic transcriptomes of individual MDV-infected F1 progeny at 4 days of age from both inbred (meat-type) broilers and inbred (egg-type) laying hens that differed in resistance. genetics to MD. The resulting information was used to identify SNPs, genes, and biological pathways that show allele-specific expression (ASE) in response to MDV infection in each type of chicken. In addition, we compared and contrasted the results of pathway analyzes (ASE and differential expression (DE)) between chicken types to help inform biological response to MDV infection. Results: With 7 individuals per line and treatment group providing high statistical power, we identified 6132 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4768 genes and 4528 SNPs in 3718 genes in broilers and layers, respectively, that exhibited ASE in response. to MDV infection. Furthermore, 548 and 434 genes in broilers and layers, respectively, were found to show ED after MDV infection. Comparing the data sets, only 72 SNPs and 850 genes for ASE and 20 genes for DE were common between the two types of birds. Although the chicken types used in this study were genetically different, at the pathway level, both the TLR receptor and JAK/STAT signaling pathways were enriched and exhibited a high proportion of ASE genes, especially at the beginning of the two aforementioned regulatory pathways. previously. Conclusions: RNA sequencing with suitable biological replicates is a powerful approach to identify high-confidence SNPs, genes, and pathways that are associated with the transcriptional response to MDV infection. Furthermore, SNPs that exhibit ASEs in response to MDV infection provide a strong basis for determining the extent to which variation in expression influences MD incidence, as well as producing genetic markers for genomic selection. However, given the lack of overlap between the ASE SNP sets (broilers vs. layers), it is likely that separate screens will need to be incorporated for each population. Finally, comparison of the gene lists obtained between these two diverse chicken types indicates that TLR and JAK/STAT signaling is conserved when responding to MDV infection and can be altered by selecting for genes exhibiting ASEs that are found at the beginning of each path. © 2013 Perumbakkam et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Perumbakkam, S.;Muir, W.

1655,Natural reservoirs for hepatitis C virus homologues,"Hepatitis C virus is considered a major public health problem, infecting 2%-3% of the human population. Hepatitis C virus infection causes acute and chronic liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In fact, hepatitis C virus infection is the most common indication for liver transplantation, and a vaccine is not available. Hepatitis C virus displays a narrow host species tropism, naturally infecting only humans, although chimpanzees are also susceptible to experimental infection. To date, there is no evidence of an animal reservoir of viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus that may have crossed the species barrier to cause disease in humans and lead to the current pandemic. Indeed, due to this restricted host range, a robust immunocompetent small animal model is still lacking, hampering mechanistic analysis of virus pathogenesis, immunologic control, and development of prophylactic vaccines. Recently, several studies have discovered new viruses related to the hepatitis C virus, belonging to the genera hepacivirus and pegivirus, in small wild mammals (rodents and bats) and domestic animals that live in close contact with humans (dogs and horses). Genetic and biological characterization of these newly discovered hepatitis C virus-like viruses that infect different mammals will contribute to our understanding of the origins of hepatitis C virus in humans and enhance our ability to study pathogenesis and immune responses using treatable animal models. In this review article, we begin with an introduction to the genetic diversity of the hepatitis C virus, and then focus on recently discovered viruses closely related to the hepatitis C virus. Finally, we discuss possible theories about the origin of this important human viral pathogen. © 2014 SSCC. All rights reserved.",,"Pfaender, S.;Brown, R. J.

Neuropathological examination of the brain and spinal cord detected nonsuppurative polioencephalomyelitis and dorsal root ganglionitis, characteristic of a neurotropic viral agent in both sheep. Metagenomic analysis of different tissue samples from both animals identified a new ovine astrovirus (OvAstV). The presence of viral genome in the central nervous system was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Although the cases occurred nine months apart, the identified OvAstV shared almost identical sequences, differing at only three nucleotide positions throughout the genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship of OvAstV with neurotropic bovine astroviruses and an enteric OvAstV.

Three pigs with unexplained cardiac and multi-organ inflammation that were negative for PCV2 and other known porcine pathogens were further tested. Methods: Histology was used to identify microscopic lesions in multiple tissues. Metagenomics was used to detect viral sequences in tissue homogenates. In situ hybridization was used to detect viral RNA expression in cardiac tissue. Results: In all three cases we characterized the genome of a new circovirus that we named PCV3 with a replicase and capsid proteins that showed 55 and 35% identities with the genetically closest proteins of a circovirus associated with bat feces and they were even more distant from those of porcine circovirus 1 and 2. Common microscopic lesions included nonsuppurative myocarditis and/or cardiac arteriolitis. Viral mRNA was detected intralesionally in cardiac cells. Deep tissue sequencing also revealed the presence of porcine astrovirus 4 in all three animals, as well as rotavirus A, porcine cytomegalovirus, and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus in individual cases.

1662,The fecal viral flora of wild rodents,"The frequent interactions of rodents with humans make them a common source of zoonotic infections. To obtain an unbiased initial measure of viral diversity in the enteric tract of wild rodents, we sequenced partially purified and randomly amplified viral RNA and DNA in feces from 105 wild rodents (mouse, vole, and rat) collected in California and Virginia. We identified in decreasing frequency sequences related to the mammalian virus families Circoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Adenoviridae and Coronaviridae. Seventeen small circular DNA genomes containing one or two replicase genes distantly related to the Circoviridae representing several potentially new viral families were characterized. In the family Picornaviridae, two new candidate genera were characterized, as well as a close genetic relative of the human pathogen Aichi virus. Fragments of the first mouse sapeloviruses and picobirnaviruses were identified, and the first murine astrovirus genome was characterized. A mouse papillomavirus genome and fragments of a new adenovirus and adenovirus-associated virus were also sequenced. The next largest fraction of the rodent fecal virome was related to insect viruses in the families Densoviridae, Iridoviridae, Polydnaviridae, Dicistroviriade, Bromoviridae, and Virgaviridae, followed by sequences related to plant viruses in Nanoviridae, Geminiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Secoviridae, Partitiviridae, Tymoviridae, families Alphaflexiviridae and Tombusviridae reflecting diet primarily of plant insects and rodents. Thus, phylogenetic analyzes of complete and partial viral genomes revealed many previously unreported viral species, genera, and families.

Recently, complete genome sequences of wild-type and vaccine strains have been determined worldwide, but none were from Europe. The aim of this study was to determine and analyze the complete genome sequences of five ILTV strains. Sequences were also compared to reveal strain similarity over time and to discriminate between wild-type and vaccine strains. The genomes of three ILTV field isolates from outbreaks in Italy in 1980, 2007 and 2011, and two commercial chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines were sequenced using 454 Life Sciences technology. Comparison with the Serva genome showed that 35 open reading frames (ORFs) differed among the five genomes. Overall, 54 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 27 amino acid differences were identified in 19 ORFs and two insertions in the UL52 and ORFC genes.

1670,Evidence for the presumed feline origin of sporadic G6P[9] rotaviruses in humans,"Species A rotaviruses are highly diverse and impose a substantial burden on human and animal health. Cross-species transmission between livestock, domestic animals, and humans is commonly observed, but the spread of animal-type rotaviruses within the human population is limited. During continuous monitoring of rotavirus strains in Germany, an unusual rotavirus strain G6P[9] was detected in the feces of a child. Complete rotavirus coding sequences revealed a unique G6-P[9]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T3-E2-H3 genotype constellation. The virus was phylogenetically related to feline G3P[9] strains and other human G6P[9] rotaviruses of presumed zoonotic origin. Analysis of G6-specific genotyping primer binding sites revealed further evidence of a feline G6P reservoir[9]. Furthermore, substantial shortcomings of conventional semi-nested PCR genotyping approaches in contemporary G6P[9] detection were revealed. Rotavirus strain GER29-14 likely resulted from direct or recent interspecies transmission from a cat to a human. Further studies could evaluate feline rotavirus nucleic acid sequences and genotype constellations to confirm the likely feline origin of sporadic human G6P[9] strains.",,"Pietsch, C.;Liebert, U.

1671,Low pathogenic avian influenza A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) virus is the progenitor of highly pathogenic A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9),"The first confirmed outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus infections in North America was caused by A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9); however, the phylogeny of this virus is largely unknown. This study performed a genomic sequence analysis of 11 avian influenza isolates from 1956 to 1979 for comparison with A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9). Phylogenetic and genetic analyzes included these viruses in combination with all known whole genome sequences of avian viruses isolated before 1981. One low pathogenic avian influenza virus, A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) was shown to , which had been isolated 3 months earlier, was the closest known genetic relative with six genome segments of common lineage encoding the PB2, PB1, and PA polymerase subunits, nucleoprotein (NP), hemagglutinin (HA), and nonstructural proteins ( NS). The lineages of these genome segments included reassortment with other North American turkey viruses that had their roots in wild North American waterfowl with the HA gene originating from serotype H5N2. Phylogenies demonstrated the adaptation of North American wild birds to turkeys with the possible involvement of domestic waterfowl. The turkey isolate, A/turkey/Wisconsin/1968 (H5N9), was the second most closely related poultry isolate to A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9), which has five genome segments of common lineage (PB2, PB1, PA, HA and neuraminidase). A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) virus was more virulent than A/turkey/Wisconsin/68 (H5N9) for chick embryos and mice, indicating greater biological similarity to A/turkey/Ontario/7732 /1966 (H5N9). Therefore, A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) was identified as the closest known ancestral relative of HPAI A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9), which will serve as a useful reference virus for characterize early genetics. and biological properties associated with the appearance of pathogenic strains of avian influenza. © 2012 SGM.",,"Ping, J.;Selman, M.;Tyler, S.;Forbes, N.;Keleta, L.;Brown, E.

1672,Evaluation of a Droplet Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction Format for DNA Copy Number Quantification,"Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a new technology that was recently commercialized to allow precise quantification of target nucleic acids in a sample. ddPCR measures absolute quantities by counting nucleic acid molecules encapsulated in discrete partitions of volumetrically defined water-in-oil droplets. This novel ddPCR format offers a simple workflow capable of generating highly stable partitions of DNA molecules. In this study, we evaluated the key performance parameters of the ddPCR system. A linear ddPCR response was obtained at DNA concentration from 0.16% to 99.6% saturation in a 20,000-drop assay corresponding to more than 4 orders of magnitude of the target DNA copy number by ddPCR . Analysis of simplex and duplex assays targeting two distinct loci in the Lambda DNA genome using the ddPCR platform agreed, within their expanded uncertainties, with values obtained using lower-density microfluidic chamber-based digital PCR (cdPCR). A relative expanded uncertainty below 5% was achieved for copy number concentration using ddPCR. This level of uncertainty is much lower than values typically observed for quantification of specific DNA target sequences using currently commercially available real-time and digital cdPCR technologies. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Pinheiro, L.

This collection involves the use of a panel of cell lines from various animal species. To facilitate the handling of such a large panel of cell lines, real-time PCR and broad-spectrum RT-PCR assays were developed to allow the detection and quantification of DNA and mRNA of β-actin, one of the housekeeping genes. most commonly used eukaryotes. Using two degenerate primers and a single probe, these two assays were shown to detect nucleic acids from a panel of vertebrate and invertebrate cell lines commonly used in animal virology. This panel included cell lines from humans, monkeys, rodents, dogs, pigs, fish, amphibians, mosquitoes, and ticks. Furthermore, both assays successfully amplified sandfly sequences encoding β-actin. Sensitivity evaluation performed on synthetic DNA and RNA sequences showed that the two assays were very sensitive and suitable for precise quantification. The two assays together constitute a convenient method suitable for multiple purposes. They can be used, for example, to estimate the amount of contaminating cellular genetic material prior to sequence-independent amplification of viral genomes achieved prior to high-throughput sequencing, to assess the efficiency of DNase and/or RNase treatments. performed on the cell extract and to verify the nucleic content. acid extraction using β-actin coding sequences as endogenous control.

1674,Transmission of a pestivirus infection in a population of Pyrenean chamois,"Outbreaks of a previously unrecorded disease have recently affected populations of Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica) throughout the Cordillera. A pestivirus was hypothesized to be the cause of this emerging disease and this type of virus can cross the species barrier and be transmitted to or from wildlife. Using an epidemiological survey conducted between 1995 and 2004 in Orlu, France, we characterized the virus and analyzed its transmission. A phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences and virus neutralization tests showed that the virus belonged to the newly described border disease virus-4 group. The increase in seroprevalence with age indicated that infection can occur at any age and resulted in lifelong immunity. Overall, 70.3% of the 323 samples were positive for anti-p80 antibodies and 10.2% of the 167 samples showed viremia, as demonstrated by ELISA antigen test or RT-PCR. Therefore, the infection has been widespread in this population since 1995, while no mass mortality or clinical signs have been observed. Incidence and seroprevalence varied seasonally and according to the number of individuals under 2 years of age in the population, so viral transmission depended on the age structure of the host population. We propose that the virus is now endemic in this population and is likely to be detrimental to reproduction and juveniles. More research is needed to estimate the impact of pestiviruses on host population dynamics and the risk of cross-transmission to farm animals. © 2006 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Pioz, M.;Loison, A.;Gibert, P.;Dubray, D.;Menaut, P.;Le Tallec, B.;Artois, M.;Gilot-Fromont, E.",2007.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.09.001,0
1675,Influenza A viruses detected in pigs in southern Germany after the H1N1 pandemic in 2009,"Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are highly prevalent in swine populations, and stable co-circulation of at least three lineages in European pigs has been well documented, up to 2009. However, since the emergence of the pandemic pdmH1N1 virus in 2009, which has been (re)introduced into individual pig herds around the world, the situation has been changing. These variations in the respective IAV groups within pig populations are of great interest, and the zoonotic potential of putative emerging viruses needs to be assessed. As data on recent IAVs in pigs from southern Germany were relatively scarce, the purpose of this study was to determine the main IAV subtypes actually present in this region. To this end, between 2010 and 2013, 1417 nasal swabs or lung tissue samples from pigs with respiratory diseases were analyzed for IAV genomes. Overall, 130 herds had IAV genomes detected by real-time RT-PCR targeting the matrix protein gene. For further analysis, various PCR protocols were adapted to rapidly subtyping between H1, pdmH1, H3, N1 and N2 sequences. Altogether, co-circulation of the three stable European IAV lineages for Bavaria was confirmed. H1N1 sequences were identified in 59, while H1N2 genomes were only diagnosed in 14 and H3N2 in 9 of the farms analyzed. However, pdmH1 in combination with N1 was detected in 2010, 2012 and 2013, confirming the presence, albeit with low prevalence, of pdmH1N2 reassortant viruses. Interestingly, individual cases of coinfections with more than one subtype were diagnosed. Partial genome sequences were determined and phylogenetic analyzes were performed. Clearly, except in the human population, classically circulating IAVs have not been displaced by pdmH1N1 in Bavarian pigs. However, some interesting viruses were detected. Further surveillance of these viruses in the Bavarian pig population will be of great importance to monitor future developments.",,"Pippig, J.;Ritzmann, M.;BÃ¼ttner, M.;Neubauer-Juric, A.",2016.0,,10.1111/zph.12264,0

1677,High turnover drives prolonged persistence of influenza in managed swine herds,"Pigs have long been hypothesized to play a central role in the emergence of new human influenza A virus (IAV) strains, serving as mixing vessels for mammalian and avian variants. However, the key issue of viral persistence in pig populations at different scales is not well understood. We addressed this gap using epidemiological models calibrated against seroprevalence data from Dutch finishing pigs to estimate the ""critical herd size"" (CHS) for IAV persistence. We then examine the viral phylogenetic evidence for persistence by comparing human and porcine IAV. Models suggest a CHS of approximately 3,000 pigs above which influenza was likely to persist, that is, orders of magnitude lower than thresholds for persistence for IAV and other acute viruses in humans. On a national and regional scale, we found much stronger empirical signatures of long-term IAV persistence in pigs compared to human populations. These surprising levels of persistence in small populations are driven by the high recruitment rate of susceptible piglets and have significant implications for pig management and general patterns of IAV genetic diversity.",,"Pitzer, V.

The purpose of the study was to determine the BVDV infection status in a dairy herd vaccinated against BVD. Before vaccination began in 2008, the potential source of infection (persistently infected animals) had not been previously identified and eliminated. It was hoped that vaccination itself would allow long-term clearance of viral excretors. Material and Methods: Serological screening of antibodies against BVDV was carried out with determination of antibody titers, BVDV antigen and presence of the viral genome with phylogenetic analysis of positive samples in the herd, despite the absence of clinical problems that would indicate possible presence of BVDV infection. Results: 19 individuals persistently infected with BVDV were identified among calves and heifers, but not in adult cattle. All virus shedders were negative for antibodies and the genotype of the virus isolated was BVDV-lb, indicating a single source of infection. The vaccine used in the herd was composed of the BVDV-Ia strain. In each of the farms evaluated, the antibody titers against BVDV-lb were higher than those against BVDV-la (median values). Conclusion: Despite a long-term vaccination program and relatively high sequence homology of BVDV vaccine and field strains (83.6%), it was not possible to prevent transplacental infections of fetuses and calf birth. persistently infected from vaccinated heifers, although protection against clinical disease was met.",,"Polak, M.

1680,Risk factors and molecular characterization of acute sporadic symptomatic hepatitis E virus infection in Thailand,"Objective: To report the clinical outcomes and viral genotypes of acute symptomatic hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in Thailand. Methods: Forty patients with acute symptomatic HEV infection were recruited during 2009-2013. Clinical, demographic and laboratory data were collected. Diagnosis was achieved by detecting anti-HEV IgM and/or HEV RNA in serum or feces. HEV genotypes were classified by direct sequencing of RT-PCR products and phylogenetic analysis. Results: The high-risk group, comprising immunocompromised, liver cirrhosis, and very elderly (>80 years) patients (17 cases), had higher serum alkaline phosphatase levels at presentation compared with the low-risk group. Two fatal cases resulted from acute hepatitis E in the high-risk group. The initial clinical presentation did not show statistically significant differences. In six cases (6/40), the virus could be detected in serum or feces by RT-PCR and sequencing. After molecular characterization, the viruses were classified as HEV genotype 3f and were in the same group as Thai porcine HEV. Conclusions: Our data showed that acute HEV infection has various clinical presentations and outcomes. Higher levels of serum alkaline phosphatase were observed in high-risk patients.

Data related to HEV infection in the wild boar population in Romania are limited to serological surveys. Therefore, our main objective was to determine the prevalence of HEV in the wild boar population and to characterize the HEV strains circulating in Romania. Using the TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay, we analyzed the presence of HEV RNA in 45 liver samples and five spleen samples collected from 50 wild boars. Samples were collected during the 2013-2015 hunting seasons. Nine samples out of 50 tested positive for HEV RNA, resulting in an overall prevalence of 18%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolates clustered into different HEV-3 monophyletic groups, depending on the sampling county.

1683,The basis of the classification of arboviruses,"The biologically defined set of arboviruses contains more than 300 separate viruses that have been subdivided into about 40 serological groups on the basis of antigenic cross-reactivity. More than three-quarters of all arboviruses can now be placed in one of the following five major taxonomic genera based on fundamental virion properties: alphaviruses, flaviviruses, orbiviruses, rhabdoviruses, bunyaviruses. There are 20 alphaviruses, representing serologic Group A, and 57 flaviviruses in serologic Group B; These two genera belong to the Togaviridae family. The 40 orbiviruses, from the family Reoviridae, include some 8 serological groups, and the 8 rhabdoviruses, from the family Rhabdoviridae, include another 3 groups. About 160 bunyaviruses, family Bunyaviridae, are divisible into 20 serological groups, 10 of which show intragroup cross-reactions in the Bunyamwera supergroup. An arbovirus contains DNA, namely the African swine fever virus; this is classified as an Iridovirus, or icosahedral cytoplasmic deoxyvirus. Nodamura virus, which has been classified as a picornavirus, should be reclassified due to evidence that it has a split genome. Several arboviruses remain taxonomically unclassified.

1684,Systemic virus distribution and host responses in the brain and intestine of chickens infected with low or high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses.,"Background: Avian influenza virus (AIV) is classified into two pathotypes, low pathogenicity (LP) and high pathogenicity (HP), based on virulence in chickens. tropism and host responses. Methods: To study differences in disease development between HPAIV and LPAIV, we examined the first appearance and eventual viral RNA load in multiple organs, as well as host responses in the brain and intestine of chickens infected with two strains. H7N1 HPAIV or closely related LPAIV. Results: Both H7N1 HPAIV and LPAIV spread systemically in chickens after a combined intranasal/intratracheal inoculation. In the brain, large differences in viral RNA load and host gene expression were found between chickens infected with H7N1 HPAIV and LPAIV. Chicken embryonic brain cell culture studies revealed that both HPAIV and LPAIV could infect cultured embryonic brain cells, but consistent with the absence of the necessary proteases, replication of LPAIV was limited. Furthermore, the TUNEL assay indicated apoptosis in the brain of chickens infected with HPAIV only. In the intestine, where endoproteases that cleave HA from LPAIV are available, we found minimal differences in the amount of viral RNA and a large overlap in transcriptional responses between chickens infected with HPAIV and LPAIV. Interestingly, the brain and ileum clearly differed in the cellular pathways that were upregulated following AI infection. Conclusions: Although H7N1 HPAIV and LPAIV RNA was detected in a wide range of tissues beyond the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, our observations indicate that differences in pathogenicity and mortality between HPAIV and LPAIV could originate from differences in virus replication. and the resulting host responses in vital organs such as the brain.",,"Post, J.;Burt, D.

Based on phylogenetic analyzes of short sequences of the 5' untranslated (150 nt) and E2 (190 nt) regions, most CSFV isolates from South and Central America were classified into subgenotypes 1.1 and 1.3, while CSFV isolates from Cuba were assigned to subgenotype 1.2. Here we show that determination and comparison of full-length E2 sequences, as well as sequences encoding Npro, C, Erns, E1, and E2 (3361nt), do not support segregation of Cuban CSFV isolates to subgenotype 1.2. In fact, our analysis revealed that the Cuban isolates are more divergent from other previously known CSFV subgenotype 1 isolates and form a new, separate subgenotype that we propose to designate as subgenotype 1.4. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",,"Postel, A.;Schmeiser, S.;Perera, C.

1687,Cowpea mosaic virus: effects on host cell processes,"ABSTRACT Taxonomy: Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) is the type member of the Comoviridae and bears a strong resemblance to animal picornaviruses, both in gene organization and in the amino acid sequence of replicating proteins. Little systematic work has been done to compare virus isolates from different parts of the world. Physical Properties: Purified virus preparations contain three centrifugal components; empty protein shells with no RNA (T) and two nucleoprotein components (M and B), containing 24% and 34% RNA, respectively. The icosahedral particles are 28 nm in diameter, consist of 60 copies of two coat proteins, and are thermostable. Hosts: CPMV causes one of the most common viral diseases of cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata), producing chlorotic spots with diffuse borders on inoculated primary leaves. Trifoliate leaves develop a bright yellow or light green mosaic of increasing severity on the younger leaves. The host range is quite limited and few hosts are known outside of legumes. The virus is transmitted by various beetles with biting mouthparts. Reported in Africa, Philippines and Iran. It is apparently absent from North and South America.

1688,Development of epitope-blocking ELISA for the universal detection of antibodies against human influenza H5N1 viruses,"Background: Human infections with highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses have generally been confirmed by molecular amplification or culture-based methods. Serological surveillance has potential advantages that have not been realized because rapid and specific serological tests to detect H5N1 infection are not widely available. Methodology/Main Findings: Here we describe an epitope-blocking ELISA to detect specific antibodies against H5N1 viruses in human or animal sera. The assay is based on a new monoclonal antibody (5F8) that binds to an epitope comprising amino acid residues 274-281 (CNTKCQTP) in the HA1 region of hemagglutinin H5. Search analysis of publicly available sequence databases revealed that this epitope is conserved in 100% of the 163 H5N1 viruses isolated from humans. The sensitivity and specificity of the H5N1 epitope blocking ELISA were evaluated using chicken antisera to multiple clades of viruses and other influenza subtypes, as well as serum samples from persons naturally infected with H5N1 or seasonal influenza viruses. Epitope blocking ELISA results were compared with those of hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) and microneutralization assays. Antibodies to H5N1 were readily detected in immunized animals or convalescent human sera by epitope-blocking ELISA, whereas samples with antibodies to other influenza subtypes were negative. The assay showed higher sensitivity and specificity compared to HI and microneutralization. Conclusions/Significance: The epitope-blocking ELISA based on a single 5F8 mAb provided highly sensitive and 100% specific detection of antibodies against H5N1 influenza viruses in human sera.",,"Prabakaran, M.;Ho, H.

1689,New crane hepatitis B virus that has an unexpectedly wide host range,"All hepadnaviruses known so far have a very limited host range, restricted to their natural hosts and a few closely related species. This is thought to be primarily due to sequence divergence in the large envelope protein and species-specific differences in host components essential for virus propagation. Here we report an infection of cranes with a new hepadnavirus, termed CHBV, that has an unexpectedly wide host range and is only distantly related evolutionarily to avihepadnaviruses from related hosts. Direct DNA sequencing of amplified CHBV DNA, as well as sequencing of the cloned viral genomes, revealed that CHBV is most closely related to, but distinct from, Ross goose hepatitis B virus (RGHBV). and slightly less closely related to duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV). Phylogenetically, cranes are very distant from geese and ducks and more closely related to herons and storks. Naturally occurring hepadnaviruses in the latter two species are highly divergent in sequence from RGHBV and DHBV and do not or only marginally infect ducks. In contrast, CHBV from crane sera and recombinant CHBV produced from LMH cells infected primary duck hepatocytes almost as efficiently as did DHBV. This is the first report of a fairly wide range of hosts for an avihepadnavirus. Our data implicate the use of similar or identical entry pathways and receptors by DHBV and CHBV, unusual mechanisms of host and virus adaptation, or divergent evolution of host genomes and cellular components necessary for virus propagation.",,"Prassolov, A.;Hohenberg, H.;Kalinina, T.;Schneider, C.;Cova, L.;Krone, O.;FrÃ¶lich, K.;Will, H.;Sirma, H.",2003.0,,10.1128/jvi.77.3.1964-1976.2003,0

The 5 infectious agents 'in vitro' showed similar properties of stability in the presence of various physical and chemical agents. These properties relate the viruses to the group of smallpox viruses and identify them as ecthyma viruses. The study of the 5 agents by seroneutralization made it possible to quantitatively express their respective relationship and dominance characters. Applying to these characters the serological definition of strains, types and subtypes proposed for the Foot-and-Mouth Disease viruses, it seems that 4 of the agents can be classified within the same antigenic subtype while the 5th is very close to the other 4 since it can be classified borderline as a different subtype.

1692,Host Response to Probiotics Determined by Nutritional Status of Rotavirus-Infected Neonatal Mice,"Objectives: Beneficial microbes and probiotics are promising agents for the prevention and treatment of enteric and diarrheal diseases in children; however, little is known about its mechanisms of action in vivo. We used a neonatal mouse model of rotavirus diarrhea to gain insights into how probiotics improve acute gastroenteritis. Methods: Rotavirus-infected mice were treated with 1 of 2 strains of Lactobacillus reuteri of human origin. We evaluated gut microbiome composition with 16S metagenomic sequencing, enterocyte migration and proliferation with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, and antibody and cytokine concentrations with multiplex analysis of gut explant cultures. Results: Probiotics reduced the duration of diarrhea, improved intestinal histopathology, and enhanced gut microbiome richness and phylogenetic diversity. The magnitude of diarrhea reduction by probiotics was strain-specific and influenced by nutritional status. L. reuteri DSM 17938 reduced the duration of diarrhea by 0, 1, and 2 days in underweight, normal weight, and overweight puppies, respectively. The magnitude of the reduction in diarrhea duration correlated with increased enterocyte proliferation and migration. The ATCC PTA 6475 strain reduced the duration of diarrhea by 1 day in all mice without increasing enterocyte proliferation. Both probiotic strains reduced concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, including macrophage inflammatory protein-I alpha and interleukin-I beta, in all animals, and increased rotavirus-specific antibodies in all but low-weight animals. . Body weight also influenced the host response to rotavirus, in terms of duration of diarrhea, enterocyte turnover, and antibody production. Conclusions: These data suggest that probiotic enhancement of enterocyte proliferation, villous repopulation, and virus-specific antibodies may contribute to diarrhea resolution, and that nutritional status influences host response to both microbes and pathogens. to beneficial pathogens.",,"Preidis, G.

1693,Whole genome of a new genotype 3 hepatitis E virus strain obtained from domestic pigs in Japan,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute or chronic hepatitis in humans and can be transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Pigs are one of the main reservoirs of this infection. Sixty pigs, 4 to 5 months of age, in a pig herd in Japan had detectable anti-HEV IgG antibodies, and five (8.3%) of them had ongoing HEV genotype 3 infection. Five HEV strains obtained from viremic pigs shared 98.8 to 100% nucleotide identity, and a representative strain (swHE1606845), whose full genome sequence was determined in this study, differed by 14.1 to 19.6 % of reported HEV strains of subtypes 3a-3k and 14.7-19.1% of other HEV strains of genotype 3 whose subtypes have not yet been assigned. swHE1606845 showed a higher nucleotide distance p value of ‰¥0.143 with genotype 3 HEV strains of subtypes 3a-3k and ‰¥0.152 with other genotype 3 strains of unassigned subtypes. A SimPlot analysis revealed a lack of recombination events. These results indicate that swHE1606845 is a candidate member of a new genotype 3 subtype.

1697,Wild bird migration across the Tibetan Qinghai Plateau: a highly pathogenic H5N1 transmission route,"Background: Qinghai Lake in central China has been at the center of debate over whether wild birds play a role in the circulation of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses. In 2005, an unprecedented epizootic in Qinghai Lake killed more than 6,000 migratory birds, including more than 3,000 bar-headed geese (Anser indicus). H5N1 subsequently spread to Europe and Africa, and in subsequent years reappeared several times in wild birds along the Central Asian flyway. Methodology/ Main Findings: To better understand the potential role of wild birds in the spread of H5N1, we studied the movements of bar-headed geese tagged with GPS satellite transmitters in Qinghai Lake in relation to virus outbreaks and factors of infection. disease risk. We discovered a previously undocumented migration route between Qinghai Lake and the Lhasa Valley of Tibet, where 93% of the 29 tagged geese wintered. Between 2003 and 2009, sixteen outbreaks in poultry or wild birds were confirmed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with most located within the geese flyway. Spatial and temporal concordance between goose movements and three possible sources of the H5N1 virus (poultry farms, a captive bar-headed goose facility, and locations of H5N1 outbreaks) indicated that there were ample opportunities for virus spread and infection. infection of migratory geese in wintering areas. Its potential as a vector for H5N1 was supported by the rapid migratory movements of some geese and the genetic relatedness of the H5N1 virus isolated from geese in Tibet and Qinghai Lake. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first study to compare the phylogenetics of the virus with the spatial ecology of its host, and the combined results suggest that wild birds play a role in the spread of H5N1 in this region. However, the strength of the evidence would improve with additional sequences from both poultry and wild birds on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where H5N1 has a clear stronghold.",,"Prosser, D.

Our study aimed to determine the genotype of the isolates and the genetic relationship with other Indonesian NDVs published in GenBank. Four NDV isolates were obtained from vaccinated flocks in 2011, 2014, 2015 in West Java, Indonesia. Two NDV belong to the virulent strain and the other two belong to the avirulent strain.

1701,The ecology and age structure of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in wild mute swans.,"The first UK epizootic of highly pathogenic (HP) H5N1 influenza in wild birds occurred in 2008, in a population of mute swans that had been the subject of ornithological study for decades. Here we use an innovative combination of ornithological, phylogenetic, and immunological approaches to investigate the ecology and age structure of HP H5N1 in the wild. We screened samples from swans and waterfowl by PCR and sequenced samples positive for HP H5N1. The origin of the outbreak was investigated by linking bird count data with molecular clock analysis of sampled virus sequences. We used call records to reconstruct the age structure of outbreak mortality and estimate the age distribution of prior exposure to avian influenza. Outbreak mortality was low and all HP H5N1 positive mute swans in the affected population were less than 3 years old. Only the youngest age classes contained appreciable numbers of individuals with no detectable antibody responses to the viral nucleoprotein. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the outbreak strain circulated locally for ~1 month prior to detection and arrived when the immigration rate of migratory waterbirds was highest. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that epizootics of HP H5N1 in wild swans exhibit limited mortality due to immunological protection arising from prior exposure. Our study population may represent a valuable resource for investigating the natural ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza.",,"Pybus, O. G.;Perrins, C. M.;Choudhury, B.;Manvell, R.

1702,Molecular characterization of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated from raccoon dogs in China,"Background: The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus can infect a variety of animals and represents a continuing threat to animal and human health. Although many H5N1 virus genotypes can be found in chickens, few are associated with infection in mammals. Characterization of the genotypes of viral strains in animal populations is important to understand the distribution of different viral strains in various hosts. This also facilitates surveillance and detection of the potential emergence of highly pathogenic strains of specific genotypes from unknown hosts or from hosts not previously reported to carry these genotypes. Methodology/ Principal Findings: Two H5N1 isolates were obtained from lung samples of two raccoon dogs that had died of respiratory disease in China. Pathogenicity experiments showed that the isolates were highly pathogenic for chickens. To characterize the genotypes of these viruses, their genomic sequences were determined and analyzed. The genetic contents of these isolates are virtually identical and may come from the same parent virus. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the isolates were closely related genetically to the H5N1 genotype V virus, which was first isolated in China in 2003, and were distinct from the dominant virus genotypes (eg, genotype Z) of the last years. The isolates also contain a multibasic amino acid motif at their HA cleavage sites and have an E residue at position 627 of the PB2 protein similar to previously identified avian viruses. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first report that H5N1 genotype V virus is associated with a mammalian host. Our results strongly suggest that genotype V H5N1 virus has the ability to cross species barriers to infect mammalian animals. These findings further highlight the risk that the H5N1 avian influenza virus poses to mammals and humans, which may be infected by specific genotypes not known to infect these hosts. © 2009 Qi et al.",,"Qi, X.;Li, X.;Rider, P.;Fan, W.;Gu, H.;Xu, L.;Yang, Y.;Lu, S.;Wang, H.;Liu, F.",2009.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0004682,0

Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis further confirmed that each of the eight genes in the isolates was closely related to classical swine H1N1 viruses, especially those isolated in China. The HA1 proteins of all three isolates were identical to those of A/Swine/Guangdong/1/01, a virus isolated in 2001 from China, although three nucleotide differences were observed.

Virus infection can trigger the change in cellular microRNA (miRNA) expression profile, which plays important post-transcriptional regulatory roles in gene expression and can greatly influence viral replication and pathogenesis. Here, we employ deep sequencing technology to determine the cellular miRNA expression profile in goat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with Nigeria vaccinia virus 75/1, a vaccine strain widely used for mass vaccination programs. against peste des petits ruminants. Expression analysis demonstrated that PPRV infection can elicit 316 significantly differentially expressed (SD) miRNAs, including 103 known and 213 novel miRNA candidates in infected PBMC at 24 hours post infection (hpi) compared to a simulated control. Target prediction and functional analysis of these DEmiRNAs revealed significant enrichment for several signaling pathways, including TLR signaling pathways, PI3K-Akt, endocytosis, viral carcinogenesis, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways.

From a total of 28 million reads per sample, we identified 1514 transcripts that were differentially expressed after infection. Both predicted and novel genetic changes were detected, as were gene isoforms, and although many of the genes were expressed by all donors, some were unique. Knockdown of genes not previously known to be associated with WNV resistance identified its critical role in controlling viral infection.

To investigate the viral diversity associated with PRDC, viral communities in serum and nasal swabs of 26 PRDC-affected piglets were investigated using metagenomics. Using deep sequencing and de novo assembly, 17 viruses were identified in two pooled libraries (16 viruses from serum, nine from nasal swabs). Porcine circovirus (PCV)-2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and pseudorabies virus, all commonly associated with PRDC, were identified in the two metagenomics pooled samples, but most viruses they comprised linear and small circular DNAs (eg, parvoviruses, bocaviruses, and circoviruses). PCR was used to compare the detection rates of each virus in serum samples from 36 PRDC-affected piglets versus 38 location-matched clinically healthy controls. The average virus category per sample was 6.81 for PRDC-affected piglets and 4.09 for controls. Single or concurrent infections with PCV-2 or PRRSV had very high detection rates in PRDC-affected piglets. Interestingly, porcine parvovirus (PPV)-2, PPV-3, PPV-6, and torque tenovirus 1a were significantly associated with PRDC.

High-throughput sequencing followed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and bioinformatic analyzes were performed to advance understanding of the regulatory networks associated with non-coding RNAs and differentially expressed mRNAs that facilitate ALV-J infection. We examined the expression of mRNA, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and miRNA in the spleen of 20-week-old chickens infected with ALV-J and uninfected chickens. We found that 1723 mRNAs, 7883 lncRNAs and 13 miRNAs in the spleen were differentially expressed between uninfected and infected groups (P < 0.05). Transcriptome analysis showed that compared to mRNA, chicken lncRNAs shared relatively fewer numbers of exons and shorter transcripts. Through competitive endogenous RNA and co-expression network analysis, we identified several tumor-associated or immune-related genes and lncRNAs. Along with transcripts whose expression levels were significantly decreased in both spleen and ALV-J-infected tumor tissues, BCL11B showed the greatest change. These results suggest that BCL11B may be mechanistically involved in chicken tumorigenesis and neoplastic diseases, may be related to the immune response, and potentially be a new biomarker for ALV-J infection.

The present study attempts to estimate a temporal reassortment history of the 2009 H1N1 viruses through a phylogenetic analysis based on a total of 394 sequences of H1N1 viruses isolated from pigs, humans, and birds. Results: Phylogenetic trees of eight gene segments showed that viruses sampled from humans formed a well-supported clade, while porcine and avian lineages intermingled. A new divergent porcine sublineage was characterized that contained gene segments from 2009 H1N1 viruses, which were closely related to porcine viruses collected in the US and South Korea during 2004 to 2007 into six segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA , NP, and NS), and to swine viruses isolated from Thailand during 2004 to 2005 in NA and M. Substitution rates varied dramatically among eight segments, and the average substitution rate was generally higher in 2009 H1N1 than in swine and humans (F 2.23= 5.972, P < 0.01). Similarly, higher dN/dS substitution ratios were identified in 2009 H1N1 than in swine and human viruses except for the M2 gene (F2, 25 = 3.779, P < 0.05). The ages of the 2009 H1N1 viruses were estimated to be between 0.1 and 0.5 years, while their common ancestors with the closest related swine viruses existed between 9.3 and 17.37 years ago. Conclusion: Our results imply that at least four reassortments or transmissions probably occurred before the 2009 H1N1 viruses. The initial reassortment arose in 1976 and Eurasian avian-like swine viruses emerged. The second transmission occurred in Asia and North America between 1988 and 1992, and mainly affected six segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP and NS). The third reassortment occurred among North American porcine and avian viruses during 1998 to 2000, involving the PB2 and PA segments. Recent reassortments occurred between classical, Eurasian, and swine reassortant swine viruses during 2004 and 2005. South Korea, Thailand, and the USA were identified. Co-circulation of multiple swine sublineages and special lifestyle in Asia could have facilitated mixing various influenza viruses, generating a new strain of virus. © 2011 Qu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Qu, Y.;Zhang, R.;Cui, P.;Song, G.;Duan, Z.;Lei, F.",2011.0,,10.1186/1743-422x-8-250,0
1715,The complex microbiota of raw milk,"Here we review what is known about the microorganisms present in raw milk, including cow, sheep, goat and human milk. Milk, due to its high nutritional content, can support a rich microbiota. These microorganisms enter milk from a variety of sources and, once in milk, can perform a variety of functions, including facilitating milk fermentation (eg, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Propionibacterium, and fungal populations), causing spoilage ( Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Bacillus, and other spore-forming or thermoduric microorganisms), promote health (eg, Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria), or cause disease (eg, Listeria, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter and mycotoxin-producing fungi). There is also concern that the presence of antibiotic residues in milk will lead to the development of resistance, particularly among pathogenic bacteria. Here, we comprehensively review these topics, while comparing both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches that can be taken to investigate the microbial composition of milk. © 2013 Federation of European Societies for Microbiology.",,"Quigley, L.;O'Sullivan, O.;Stanton, C.;Beresford, T.

1716,A direct high-throughput Cell-ELISA to measure the infectivity of cytopathic and non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus strains applied to the evaluation of antiviral activity,"Low-cost, high-throughput methods applicable to any virus strain are required to screen antiviral compounds against multiple field strains. Colorimetric cell viability assays are used for this purpose as long as the viruses are cytopathic (CP) in cell culture. However, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) strains circulating in the field are mostly noncytopathic (NCP). An In Cell-ELISA was developed to measure viral infectivity by detecting a conserved protein produced during viral replication (nonstructural protein 3, ""NS3""). The ELISA is performed without harvesting the cells, directly in the 96-well culture plate. NS3 In Cell-ELISA was tested for its ability to assess the BVDV-specific antiviral activity of recombinant bovine type I and III IFNs. The results correlated with those measured by qRT-PCR and virus titration. NS3 In Cell-ELISA was also efficient in estimating the IC50 of two compounds with different antiviral activity. Estimation of the 50% inhibition dose of each IFN using six BVDV strains of different biotypes and genotypes showed that CP strains were more susceptible to both IFNs than to NCPs, while type 2 NCP viruses were more sensitive to the IFN-Is. The In Cell-ELISA format using a detector antibody against a conserved nonstructural protein can potentially be applied to accurately measure the infectivity of any viral strain.",,"Quintana, M.

1717,Genome dynamics and molecular infection epidemiology of multidrug-resistant Helicobacter pullorum isolates obtained from free-range broilers in India,"Some zoonotic, foodborne, and life-threatening infections are transmitted through poultry. The inappropriate and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in the livestock industry has led to a higher prevalence of multiresistant bacteria with epidemic potential. Here, we present a functional molecular epidemiological analysis involving whole genome sequence-based and phenotypic characterization of 11 H. pullorum isolates from broilers and free-range chickens sampled at retail wet markets in the city of Hyderabad, India. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that all isolates were resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, and macrolides. The isolates were also found to be producers of extended-spectrum β-lactamase and even resistant to clavulanic acid. Whole genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis of these isolates revealed the presence of five to six well-characterized antimicrobial resistance genes, including those encoding resistance nodulating cleavage efflux pump(s). Phylogenetic analysis combined with pan-genomic analysis revealed a remarkable degree of genetic diversity among isolates from free-range chickens; on the contrary, a high degree of genetic similarity was observed among the broiler isolates. Comparative genomic analysis of all publicly available H. pullorum genomes, including our isolates (n = 16), along with the genomes of 17 other Helicobacter species, revealed a large number (8,560) of H. pullorum, with an average of 535 such genes per isolate. In silico virulence screening identified 182 important virulence genes and also revealed a high content of strain-specific genes in free-range chicken isolates (mean, 34) compared with broiler isolates. A significant prevalence of prophages (ranging from 1 to 9) and a significant presence of genomic islands (0 to 4) were observed in isolates from free range and broiler chickens. Taken together, these observations provide significant baseline data for the functional molecular infection epidemiology of non-pyloric Helicobacter species such as H. pullorum by unraveling their evolution in chickens and their potential zoonotic transmission to humans. IMPORTANCE: Globally, the poultry industry is expanding with a growing consumer base for chicken meat. Given this, the transmission of multidrug-resistant bacteria associated with food represents a major problem in health care. Our study involves a critical reference approach directed at the genome sequence-based epidemiology and transmission dynamics of H. pullorum, an avian pathogen that has established zoonotic potential. We believe that our studies would facilitate the development of surveillance systems to ensure the safety of human food and guide public health policies related to the use of antibiotics in animal feed in countries such as India. We sequenced 11 new H. pullorum genomes as part of this study. These genomes would provide much value in addition to the ongoing comparative genomic studies of Helicobacter.",,"Qumar, S.;Majid, M.;Kumar, N.;Tiwari, S.

1718,Identification of bovine papillomavirus 10 in bovine teat warts by DNase-SISPA,"Papillomaviruses are detected and identified by PCR with consensus primers designed from human papillomavirus sequences. These and other primers failed to detect papillomavirus in bovine teat wart samples despite repeated attempts. DNase-SISPA, a metagenomic method to identify viruses, could identify bovine papillomavirus type 10 in bovine teat warts. Sequence comparison between consensus primers and bovine papillomavirus type 10 sequences revealed many differences between consensus primers and BPV-10 sequences. We suggest that DNase-SISPA can be used as an alternative method for papillomavirus diagnosis, in cases where PCR fails to identify papillomaviruses. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",,"Rai, G.

1719,Review of Psittacine beak and feather disease and its effect on Australian endangered species,"BACKGROUND: Since it was first described in the early 1980s, psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD) has been recognized as the dominant viral pathogen of psittacine birds in Australia . Our aim was to assess and review the effect of PBFD and its position as a key threatening process for Australian psittacine bird species. We review the origin/evolutionary pathways and potential threat of PBFD to endangered psittacine bird populations and captive breeding flocks. CONCLUSIONS: The most recent phylogenetic analyzes of beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) indicate that all endangered Australian psittacine bird species are susceptible and equally likely to be infected by the genotypes of BFDV from a variety of host psittacine species. Disease management in captive breeding programs has been based on testing and culling, which has been costly. The risk of PBFD must be carefully considered by management teams contemplating the establishment of captive breeding flocks for endangered species. Alternative disease prevention tools, including vaccination, which are increasingly being used in wildlife health, should be considered more seriously for the management and prevention of PBFD in captive flocks of Critically Endangered species.",,"Raidal, S.

1720,Functional characterization of a novel tmp1 gene encoding antibacterial holin-like protein from goat skin surface metagenome,"We have identified a holin-like gene from a goat skin surface metagenome. The ORF designated tmp1 encoding 34 amino acids shares sequence similarity with the putative holin-like toxin genes. To test the antibacterial activity of the protein encoded by tmp1, this ORF was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The expressed Tmp1 gene product showed antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria but not against Gram-negative bacteria. A single transmembrane domain (TMD) was identified within Tmp1 and deletion analysis of the N-terminal region and TMD indicated that TMD is responsible for the antibacterial activity. TMD-dependent antibacterial activity was validated using a synthetic peptide with the amino acid sequence of TMD. In addition to antibacterial activity, Tmp1 also complemented the function of holin in a lysis-defective bacteriophage lambda. To broaden the spectrum of antibacterial activity, a tmp1 mutant library was generated by random mutagenesis. Four mutants with amino acid substitutions at the N-terminus of Tmp1 exhibited increased antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and were nonhemolytic. An enhanced activity of these mutant proteins is attributed to their increased hydrophobicity. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,"Rajesh, T.;Anthony, T.;Saranya, S.;Pushpam, P.

1721,Sequence analysis of infectious bursal disease viruses isolated from India: phylogenetic relationships,"The prevalence of infectious bursal disease (IBD) among chickens in different parts of Tamil Nadu, India, has been studied by collecting bursal samples from suspected flocks and using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). for the amplification of a specific product. of 474 bp of the variable region of the VP2 gene. Among 53 bursal samples examined by RT-PCR, 40 showed a positive reaction. The amplified products were subjected to nucleotide sequencing and the sequences obtained were compared with those of the Georgia strain IBD virus vaccine (IBDV), the classically virulent 52/70 strain, and the highly virulent Japanese OKYM strain. Nucleotide homology data indicated that all isolates from Tamil Nadu showed homology ranging from 91 to 99.6% with each other. When compared to the highly virulent Japanese OKYM strain, four isolates clustered with that strain. Most of the isolates were grouped with the very virulent OKYM strain, as can be seen from the phylogenetic analysis performed with the MEGA program. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of IBDV isolates with those of the Georgia vaccine strain, classically virulent 52/70 strain, and highly virulent OKYM strain also revealed the presence of a conserved serine-rich heptapeptide sequence in most the isolated ones. The results of this study indicate that most IBDV isolates are highly virulent, which is evident from the high mortality that has been reported in some poultry flocks despite regular vaccination.",,"Ramadass, P.;Thiagarajan, V.;Parthiban, M.;Senthil Kumar, T.

1722,Differentiation of bovine herpesvirus1 subtypes based on UL0.5 gene sequencing,"Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis is one of the most economically important diseases of cattle and is caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV1). Based on the restriction endonuclease fingerprint of viral DNA, BoHV1 can be divided into three subtypes, namely BoHV1.1, 1.2a and 1.2b. Since this method requires pure viral DNA, it is time consuming and labor intensive. In the current study, UL0.5 gene-based PCR sequencing has been used for BoHV1 subtyping. Of five isolates, four had BoHV1-like signatures and one isolate had BoHV1.2-like signatures. Furthermore, these viruses were phylogenetically grouped into the respective subtypes. These results indicate that UL 0.5 gene-based PCR sequencing could be used as an alternative method of subtyping BoHV1.",,"Ramakrishnan, M. A.;Pundkar, C.

1723,Molecular Signature of High Yield (Growth) Influenza A Virus Rearrangements Prepared as Seed Vaccine Candidates,"Background: Human influenza virus isolates generally grow poorly in embryonated chicken eggs. Therefore, gene reassortment of wild-type (wt) influenza A viruses is performed with a highly egg-adapted donor virus, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8), to provide the viral ""seeds."" high-yield regroupers (HYR) for the vaccine. production. HYR should contain the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the wt virus and one to six ""internal"" PR8 genes. Most studies of influenza wt and HYR have focused on the HA gene. The main objective of this study is the identification of the molecular signature in the eight genetic segments of the influenza A HYR vaccine candidate seeds associated with high growth in ovo. Methodology: The genomes of 14 wt parental viruses, 23 HYR (5, 1976 H1N1-SOIV; 2, 2009 H1N1pdm; 2 H2N2 and 12 H3N2), and PR8 were sequenced using the high-throughput sequencing pipeline with large dye terminator chemistry. Results: Silent and coding mutations were found in all PR8-derived internal genes with the exception of the M gene. The PR8-derived M gene did not vary in all 23 HYRs, underscoring the critical role of PR8 M in the high phenotype. performance. None of the internal genes derived from the wt virus had silent changes except the PB1 gene in X-157. The highest number of silent and recurrent coding mutations was found in NS. Regarding surface antigens, most of the HYRs had coding mutations in HA; only 2 HYRs had coding mutations in NA. Significance: In the era of the application of reverse genetics to alter influenza A virus genomes, mutations identified in HYR gene segments associated with high growth in ovo may be of great practical benefit in modifying PR8 and/or or wt virus gene sequences to enhance the growth of vaccine ""seed"" viruses. © 2013 Ramanunninair et al.",,"Ramanunninair, M.;Le, J.;Onodera, S.;Fulvini, A.

1724,Genetic diversity and mutation of avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (Newcastle disease virus) in wild birds and evidence of intercontinental spread,"Avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV-1), or Newcastle disease virus, is the causal agent of Newcastle disease, one of the most economically important diseases for poultry production worldwide and the cause of periodic epizootics in wild birds in North America. In this study, we examine the genetic diversity of APMV-1 isolated from migratory birds sampled in Alaska, Japan, and Russia and assess evidence for intercontinental spread of the virus using phylogenetic methods. In addition, we predicted viral virulence using deduced amino acid residues for the fusion protein cleavage site and estimated mutation rates for the fusion gene from class I and class II migratory bird isolates. The 73 isolates sequenced as part of this study were most closely related to previously reported virus genotypes for wild birds; however, five class II genotype I isolates formed a monophyletic clade exhibiting previously unreported genetic diversity, which met the criteria for designation of a new subgenotype. Phylogenetic analysis of wild bird isolates provided evidence for the intercontinental spread of the virus, specifically APMV-1 class II genotype I subgenotypes Ib and Ic viral lineages. This result supports the movement of migratory birds as a possible mechanism for APMV-1 redistribution. None of the predicted deduced amino acid motifs for the fusion protein cleavage site of APMV-1 strains isolated from migratory birds in Alaska, Japan, and Russia were consistent with those of previously identified virulent viruses. Therefore, these data do not support that these strains contribute to the emergence of avian pathogens. Estimated mutation rates for fusion genes from class I and class II wild bird isolates were faster than previously reported for avirulent APMV-1 strains. Taken together, these findings provide new insights into the diversity, spread, and evolution of APMV-1 in wild birds.",,"Ramey, A. M.;Reeves, A. B.;Ogawa, H.;Ip, H. S.;Imai, K.;Bui, V.

The reads obtained from the sequencing were analyzed and compared with sequences in the GenBank database. Sequences related to viruses from the viral families Herpesviridae, Alloherpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Retroviridae, and Myoviridae showed the highest overall abundances in the samples. Virome analysis identified viruses that had not been found in feces of wild ducks and revealed different virome profiles between different species and between samples of the same species.

The genomic library was amplified using primers complementary to the oligoligand and subjected to single and paired-end sequencing. Raw reads were assembled using a de novo method and reference-based assembly was performed based on contig data. Nearly complete sequences of all BTV segments with greater than 20x coverage were obtained, and the single-read sequencing method was sufficient to identify the genotype and serotype of the virus.

This coronavirus has been widely distributed among laboratories and has been transmitted in both pigs as in cell cultures. To determine the variability between different stocks of the PEDV strain CV777, full-length genome sequencing (approx. 28 kb) has been performed in 6 different laboratories, using different protocols. Not surprisingly, each of the different whole genome sequences were distinct from each other and from the reference sequence (Accession Number AF353511), but they are >99% identical. Unique and shared differences between sequences were identified. The surface-exposed spike protein coding region showed the highest proportion of variability, including point mutations and small deletions. The predicted expression of the ORF3 gene product was more affected in three different variants of this virus through the loss of the initiation codon or the gain of a premature termination codon.

1734,Tick metagenomic profiling: identification of new rickettsia genomes and detection of tick-borne canine parvovirus,"BACKGROUND: Throughout the world, ticks act as vectors of human and animal pathogens. Ticks are based on bacterial endosymbionts, which often share close and complex evolutionary links with tick-borne pathogens. Since the prevalence, diversity, and virulence potential of tick-borne agents remain poorly understood, there is a pressing need for microbial surveillance of ticks as potential disease vectors. METHODOLOGY/MAIN RESULTS: We developed a two-stage protocol including 16S amplicon detection of pooled samples of hard ticks collected from dogs, sheep, and camels in Palestine, followed by shotgun metagenomics on individual ticks to detect and characterize tick-borne pathogens. and endosymbionts. Two ticks isolated from sheep produced a large number of reads from the Rickettsia genus, which were assembled into draft genomes. One of the resulting genomes was very similar to Rickettsia massiliae strain MTU5. The analysis of the characteristic genes showed that the other one represents the first sequence of the genome of the potential pathogenic Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae. Ticks from a dog and a sheep produced draft genomic sequences of Coxiella strains. A sheep tick produced sequences from the sheep pathogen Anaplasma ovis, while camel Hyalomma ticks produced sequences belonging to Francisella-like endosymbionts. From the metagenome of a canine Jericho tick, we generated a genomic sequence of a canine parvovirus. SIGNIFICANCE: Here, we have demonstrated how a cost-effective two-step protocol can be used to detect and characterize tick-borne pathogens and endosymbionts. By retrieving genome sequences from an unexpected pathogen (canine parvovirus) and a previously unsequenced pathogen (Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae), we demonstrate the open-ended nature of metagenomics. We also provide evidence that ticks can transmit canine parvovirus, raising the possibility that ticks may contribute to the spread of this troublesome virus.",,"Ravi, A.;Ereqat, S.;Al-Jawabreh, A.;Abdeen, Z.;Abu Shamma, O.;Hall, H.;Pallen, M.

1735,Network inference from multimodal data: a review of approaches to infectious disease transmission,"Network inference problems are commonly found in multiple biomedical subfields, such as genomics, metagenomics, neuroscience, and epidemiology. Networks are useful for representing a wide range of complex interactions ranging from those between molecular biomarkers, neurons, and microbial communities, to those found in human or animal populations. Recent technological advances have resulted in an ever-increasing amount of healthcare data across multiple modalities, increasing the preponderance of network inference issues. Multi-domain data can now be used to improve the robustness and reliability of networks recovered from single-mode data. For infectious diseases in particular, there is a body of knowledge that has focused on combining multiple pieces of linked information. Combining or analyzing disparate modalities in concert has shown a greater understanding of disease transmission than could be gained from any one modality alone. This has been particularly helpful in understanding the incidence and early-stage transmission of infections that have pandemic potential. New pieces of linked information in the form of spatial, temporal, and other covariates, including data from high-throughput sequences, clinic visits, social media information, pharmaceutical prescriptions, and clinical symptoms (reported as free-text data) also encourage greater investigation of these methods. The purpose of this review is to provide an in-depth analysis of multimodal infectious disease transmission network inference methods with a specific focus on Bayesian inference. We focus on analytical methods based on Bayesian inference, as this allows multiple parameters to be retrieved simultaneously, for example, not only the disease transmission network, but also parameters of the epidemic dynamics. Our review studies its assumptions, key inference parameters, and limitations, and ultimately provides insights on how to improve future network inference methods across multiple applications.",,"Ray, B.;Ghedin, E.;Chunara, R.",2016.0,,10.1016/j.jbi.2016.09.004,0
1736,Finding a needle in the haystack of the virus metagenome: micro-metagenome analysis captures a snapshot of the diversity of a bacteriophage cabinet,"Viruses are ubiquitous in the oceans and critical components of marine microbial communities, regulating the transfer of nutrients to higher trophic levels or to dissolved organic deposition through lysis of host cells. Hydrothermal vent systems are oases of biological activity in the deep oceans, so knowledge of biodiversity and its impact on the global ocean biogeochemical cycle is still in its infancy. In order to obtain biological information on viral communities present in hydrothermal vent systems, we developed a method based on deep sequencing of pulsed-field gel electrophoretic bands representing key viral fractions present in seawater within and around hydrothermal vents. a hydrothermal plume derived from the Loki Castle vent field in the Arctic Mid-Oceanic Ridge. The reduction in virus community complexity afforded by this novel approach enabled the near-complete reconstruction of a lambda-like phage genome from the feather virus fraction. Phylogenetic examination of distinct gene regions in this lambdoid phage genome revealed diversity in loci encoding integrase-like and superinfection exclusion proteins. This suggests the importance of tuning lyogenic conversion as a viral survival strategy and provides insight into the nature of virus-host and virus-virus interactions within hydrothermal plumes. By reducing the complexity of the viral community through targeted sequencing of prominent viral dsDNA fractions, this method has selectively mimicked virus dominance approaching that hitherto achieved through culture alone, enabling bioinformatic analysis. to locate a lambdoid viral ""needle"" within the larger viral community. alpaca"".

PSV infections in pigs have been reported in European countries, the United States, Japan, China, Korea, and Brazil. The virus has been isolated/detected from faeces of healthy pigs, as well as those affected with diarrhoea, respiratory signs, encephalitis, skin lesions and impaired fertility. This study was planned to investigate whether PSV is prevalent among pigs in India and to characterize the PSV found in the study population. The study revealed that five of 70 (7.14%) fecal samples tested positive for PSV using RT-PCR. Three viruses were successfully isolated from fecal samples using the IB-RS-2 cell line. Whole genome sequencing and analysis of an Indian PSV isolate revealed the highest homology (88%) to the V13 strain from England. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete polyprotein nucleotide sequences of 14 PSV strains classified the viruses into four distinct clades. This first report from India adds to our knowledge about the genetic diversity of PSV detected so far among pigs in different countries.

1739,Comparación entre la secuenciación del transcriptoma y la metagenómica 16S para la detección de patógenos bacterianos en la vida silvestre,"Background Rodents are major reservoirs of pathogens responsible for numerous zoonotic diseases in humans and livestock. Assessing their microbial diversity at both individual and population levels is crucial for monitoring endemic infections and revealing patterns of microbial association within reservoirs. Recently, NGS approaches have been employed to characterize microbial communities from different ecosystems. However, their relative efficacy has not been evaluated. Here, we compare two NGS approaches, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and 16S metagenomics, evaluating their ability to study neglected zoonotic bacteria in rodent populations. Methodology/Main Findings We first extracted nucleic acids from the spleens of 190 voles collected in France. RNA extracts were pooled, randomly reverse transcribed, and then RNA-Seq was performed using HiSeq. The assembled bacterial sequences were assigned to the closest taxon recorded in GenBank. DNA extracts were analyzed by a 16S metagenomics approach using two sequencers: the 454 GS-FLX and the MiSeq. The V4 region of the gene encoding 16S rRNA was amplified for each sample using barcoded universal primers. The amplicons were multiplexed and processed in the different sequencers. The resulting data sets were demultiplexed and each read was processed through a pipeline to be taxonomically classified using the Ribosomal Database Project. In total, 45 pathogenic bacterial genera were detected. Bacteria identified by RNA-Seq were comparable to those detected by the MiSeq-processed 16S metagenomics approach (16S-MiSeq). In contrast, 21 of these pathogens were missed when the 16S metagenomic approach was processed by pyrosequencing 454 (16S-454). Furthermore, 16S metagenomics approaches revealed a high level of co-infection in bench mice. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that RNA-Seq and 16S-MiSeq are equally sensitive in detecting bacteria. Although only the 16S-MiSeq method allowed the identification of bacteria in each individual reservoir, with subsequent derivation of bacterial prevalence in host populations and generation of patterns of bacterial interactions within the reservoir. Lastly, the number of bacterial reads obtained with the 16S-MiSeq could be a good indicator of bacterial prevalence.",,"Razzauti, M.;Galan, M.;Bernard, M.;Maman, S.;Klopp, C.;Charbonnel, N.;Vayssier-Taussat, M.;Eloit, M.;Cosson, J.

1740,Information on stress response genes and the resistome in the rumen of Bubalus bubalis through metagenomic analysis,"The buffalo rumen microbiota experiences a variety of diets and represents a huge reservoir of mobilome, resistome, and stress responses. However, knowledge of metagenomic responses to such conditions is still rudimentary. We analyzed buffalo rumen metagenomes in the liquid and solid phase of biomaterial from the river buffalo rumen adapted to variable proportions of concentrate to green or dry forages, using high-throughput sequencing for the appearance of antibiotic resistance genes, exchange between bacterial population and environmental reservoirs. A total of 3914.94 MB of data was generated from the three treatment groups. The data was analyzed with the tools of the Metagenome rapid annotation system. At the phyla level, Bacteroidetes was dominant in all treatments followed by Firmicutes. Genes encoding functional responses to stress (oxidative stress and heat shock proteins) and resistome genes (resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, phages, transposable elements and islands of pathogenicity) prevailed in similar proportion in the liquid and solid fraction of rumen metagenomes. Fluoroquinolone resistance, MDR efflux pump, and methicillin resistance genes were widely distributed in 11, 9, and 14 classes of bacteria, respectively. Bacteria responsible for phage replication and prophage and phage packaging and rlt-like streptococcal phage genes were mainly assigned to Bacteroides, Firmicutes and Proteaobacteria phyla. Furthermore, more reads matching sigma B genes were identified in the buffalo rumen. This study highlights the presence of various adaptation mechanisms to different diets, antibiotics and other stresses in the buffalo rumen, reflecting the proportional representation of the main bacterial groups.",,"Reddy, B.;Singh, K.

1741,Molecular characterization of Indian rabies virus isolates by partial sequencing of nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) genes,"Rabies is endemic and a major zoonosis in India. Very few reports are available on the molecular epidemiology of rabies virus of Indian origin. In this study to understand the dynamics of rabies virus, a total of 41 rabies-positive brain samples from dogs, cats, domestic animals, wildlife, and humans from 11 states were subjected to RT-PCR amplification of the N gene between nucleotides N521-N1262 (742 bp) and the P gene between nucleotides P239-P750 (512 bp). The N gene could be amplified from 30, while the P gene from 41 samples, using specific sets of primers. Phylogenetic analysis based on the N gene indicated that all viruses isolated from India are genetically closely related to a single group of arctic/arctic-like viruses. However, two distinct groups were performed on the P gene-based phylogeny, namely rabies virus isolates from Punjab and rabies virus isolates from the remaining parts of India (except Punjab). All rabies virus isolates from India were closely related to geography (>95% homology) but not to host species. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Reddy, G. B. M.;Singh, R.;Singh, R.

1742,Genetic characterization of the Belgian nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) reference strain B1648,"The virulent nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) strain B1648 was first isolated in 1984, in Flanders, Belgium. Despite intensive vaccination, B1648 and its variants continue to circulate in Europe and North Africa. Here, the complete genome of this Belgian NIBV reference strain was determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to understand its evolutionary relationship to other IBV strains and to identify potential genetic factors that may be associated with nephropathogenicity. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted in strain B1648 (51UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-EM-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-31UTR). ORFs 4b, 4c, and 6b, which have been rarely reported in the literature, were present in B1648 and most other complete IBV genomes. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genome, replicase transcriptase complex, spike protein, partial S1 gene, and M protein, strain B1648 clusters with non-type strains Massachusetts NGA/A116E7/2006, UKr 27-11, QX-like ITA /90254/2005, QX type CK/SWE/0658946/10, TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05. Based on the partial S1 fragment, B1648 was grouped with strains TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05 and further designated as genotype B1648. The complete genome of B1648 shared the highest sequence homology with UKr 27-11, Gray, JMK, and NGA/A116E7/2006 (91.2% to 91.6%) and was least related to the Beaudette and Massachusetts reference strains ( 89.7%). . Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyzes indicated that strain B1648 may have played an important role in the evolution of IBV in Europe and North Africa. In addition, the determinants of nephropathogenicity could be located in proteins 1a, spike, M and accessory (3a, 3b, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b and 6b). In general, the B1648 strain is distinct from all strains reported so far in Europe and other parts of the world.",,"Reddy, V. R.;Theuns, S.;Roukaerts, I. D.;Zeller, M.;Matthijnssens, J.;Nauwynck, H.

1744,Monitoring of the antigenic evolution of the foot-and-mouth disease virus,"Quantifying and predicting the antigenic characteristics of a virus is something of a holy grail for infectious disease research due to its central importance for the emergence of new strains, the severity of outbreaks, and the selection of vaccines. However, these features are defined by a complex interplay of viral and host factors such that phylogenetic measures of viral similarity often correlate poorly with antigenic relationships. Here, we generate antigenic phylogenies that trace the phenotypic evolution of two FMD virus serotypes by combining host serology and viral sequence data to identify sites that are critical for their antigenic evolution. For the SAT1 serotype, we validated our antigenic phylogeny against monoclonal antibody escape mutants, which match all predicted antigenic sites. For serotype O, we validated against known sites when available, and otherwise directly assessed the impact on antigenic phenotype of substitutions at predicted sites using reverse genetics and serology. We also highlight a critical and poorly understood issue for vaccine selection by revealing qualitative differences between assays that are often used interchangeably to determine antigenic matching between field viruses and vaccine strains. Our approach provides a tool to identify natural antigenic substitutions, allowing us to trace genetic diversification and associated antigenic evolution of the virus. Despite the extremely important role that vaccines have played in improving human and animal health, vaccinology remains a clearly empirical science. This study advances the field by providing guidance for fine-tuning vaccine strains through site-directed mutagenesis through this high-resolution tracking of virus antigenic evolution between rare major changes in phenotype.",,"Reeve, R.;Borley, D.

1746,Beak and feather disease virus circulating in Cape parrots (Poicepahlus robustus) in South Africa,"Captive and wild parrots are vulnerable to the highly contagious parrot beak and feather disease. The causative agent, beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), was recently detected in the largest remaining population of the endangered Cape Parrot (Poicepahlus robustus), which are endemic to South Africa. Whole genomes from 26 blood samples collected from wild and captive Cape Parrots were isolated and sequenced to determine possible sources of infection. All sequences had characteristic BFDV sequence motifs and were similar in length to those reported in the literature. However, the BFDV coat protein (CP) sequences from this study did not contain a previously identified bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) within residues 39-56, indicating that an alternative NLS is involved in transport of CP to the nucleus. Sequences from the wild population shared a high degree of similarity, regardless of year or location, suggesting that the disease outbreak occurred close to the time the samples were collected. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genomes showed that sequences from captive Cape parrots cluster with those isolated from captive-bred budgerigars in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. Exposure to captive-bred Cape Parrots at a breeding facility in KwaZulu-Natal is suggested as a possible source of virus infection. Phylogenetic analysis of BFDV isolates from wild and captive Cape Parrots indicated two separate infection events in different populations, highlighting the potential risk of introducing new virus strains into the wild population. The present study represents the first systematic investigation of BFDV virus diversity in the southernmost population of Cape Parrots.",,"Regnard, G. L.;Boyes, R. S.;Martin, R. O.;Hitzeroth, I.

Following an immediate escalation to official and regulatory investigation to rule out the presence of reportable AI viruses (AIVs; subtypes H5 or H7), a non-reportable low pathogenicity (LP) AIV H4N6 was detected through virus isolation in cell-free embryos. of specific pathogens (SPF). ) chicken eggs, neuraminidase inhibition test, cleavage site sequencing, and H4 subtype AIV-specific serology. Restrictions on movement of premises have been lifted and no further disease control measures have been implemented under UK law. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the virus revealed closer relationships with viruses from muscovy ducks in Sweden during 2007 and 2009. In June 2014, clinical suspicion of NAD was reported in a flock of laying hens outdoors in other parts of the UK, due to increased daily mortality and reduced egg production over a five-day period. An LPAIV H4N6 with an intravenous pathogenicity index of 0.50 was isolated. This virus was genetically very similar, but not identical, to the virus detected in May 2014. Complete analyzes of the viral genome showed characteristics of a strain that had not recently been transferred from wild birds, implying that spread within of the poultry sector. A stem deletion in the neuraminidase gene sequence indicated an adaptation of the virus to poultry. In addition, there was unexpected evidence of systemic spread of the virus at autopsy.

Using a high-throughput strategy to isolate new giant viruses from their original protozoan hosts, we obtained eight isolates of a new giant viral lineage from Vermamoeba vermiformis, the most common free-living protist found in human environments. This new lineage was proposed to be the faustovirus lineage. The prototype member, faustovirus E12, forms 200-nm icosahedral virions that lack fibrils and encapsulate a 466-kbp genome encoding 451 predicted proteins. Of these, 164 are found in the virion. Phylogenetic analysis of core viral genes showed that faustovirus is distantly related to the mammalian pathogenic African swine fever virus, but encodes ≥3-fold more mosaic gene complements. About two-thirds of these genes show no significant similarity to known protein-coding genes. These findings show that expanding the protist panel to discover new giant viruses is a fruitful strategy. SIGNIFICANCE Using Vermamoeba, a protist that lives in humans and their environment, we isolated eight strains of a new giant virus we call Faustovirus.

1750,Chimeric Hepatitis C Virus/CSFV Assay 5â€²NTR: Sequences Within the Hepatitis C Virus IRES Required for Viral RNA Replication,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is classified in the Hepacivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, whose members have a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity, encoding a single polyprotein. Within this family, HCV is closely related to viruses in the Pestivirus genus, which includes classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Hepaciviral and pestiviral polyprotein translation is initiated by internal ribosome entry, promoted by the 5â€²NTR. The secondary and tertiary RNA structures of the 5â€²NTRs of HCV and pestivirus are well conserved, despite the fact that their sequences differ significantly from each other. By analogy with other positive-stranded RNA viruses, it is likely that the HCV NTR 5 contains cis-acting determinants for replication as well as determinants for translation. Studies on both signals could be complicated, since these signals could overlap. In this study, this problem was addressed by constructing chimeric HCV/CSFV 5â€²NTRs. A two-step analysis of these 5'NTRs was performed: (a) in a translation assay, which provided the possibility to study translation independently of possible effects on replication; and (b) in a replication assay, in which only chimeric 5'NTRs for which IRES-dependent translation was demonstrated were studied. An overlap between HCV RNA elements involved in these processes was observed. Domain II swapping had a minor effect on the translational efficiency of the chimeric 5'NTRs, whereas replication of subgenomic replicons with these chimeric 5'NTRs was abolished. Swapping domain III subdomains severely decreased translational activity, while replication was maintained.",,"Reusken, C. B. E.;Dalebout, T. J.;Eerligh, P.;Bredenbeek, P. J.;Spaan, W. J.

However, it has recently been shown that human infection can occur in developed countries with no history of travel and that pigs can act as a reservoir. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify hepatitis E virus by molecular methods in patients with acute non-AC hepatitis infection with no history of recent travel to Hungary and to determine the viral genetic relationship to known HEV strains. MATERIALS: Laboratory diagnosis of hepatitis E virus infection was performed on patient sera by HEV IgM and IgG ELISA, IgM and IgG immunoblot, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using primers for the region of the partial viral capsid. RESULTS: The patient with acute hepatitis of unknown origin was treated at Szeged Hospital in June 2004. The acute patient's serum was positive for HEV IgM and IgG confirmed by immunoblot. The viral genome was successfully amplified in sera by RT-PCR. By sequence and phylogenetic analysis, the virus, designated Hungary-1, showed 95% nucleotide identity to genotype 3 related hepatitis E viruses with the highest identity to the porcine HEV strain (Sp354-1-02). ) and with 90% nucleic acid identity with the human strain (Greece2). DISCUSSION: Hepatitis E virus infection is present in Hungary without travel to known endemic regions. The first HEV identified in Hungary, representing a new human genetic lineage, supports the possibility of endemic infections caused by genotype 3 strains in developed countries and that pigs may act as a reservoir for human HEV.",,"Reuter, G.;Fodor, D.;Katai, A.;Szucs, G.",2005.0,2020-11-01 00:00:00,,0

1764,Borna disease virus: a mystery as an emerging zoonotic pathogen,"Borna disease (EB) has long been known to veterinarians in Central Europe as a sporadically occurring progressive viral polioencephalomyelitis predominantly affecting horses and sheep and, as discovered in the last decade, an increasing number of domestic and zoo animals. The etiologic agent, Borna disease virus (BDV), a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus classified in the new family of viruses Bornaviridae within the order Mononegavirales, can induce severe clinical signs typical of viral encephalitis with striking behavioral changes . After an incubation period of a few weeks to several months, BDV infection causes locomotor and sensory dysfunction followed by paralysis and death. Natural infections appear to be subclinical in most cases. BD received worldwide attention when it was reported that sera and/or cerebrospinal fluids from neuropsychiatric patients may contain BDV-specific antibodies. Since infected animals produce BDV-specific antibodies only after virus replication, it was assumed that the broad spectrum of BDV-susceptible species also includes man. However, reports describing the presence of other markers of BDV, i.e., BDV-RNA or BDV-antigen, in peripheral blood leukocytes or brain tissue of neuropsychiatric patients are highly controversial, and thus the role of BDV. in human neuropsychiatric disorders is questionable.

Phylogenetic analysis suggested that these groups, designated BVDV I and BVDV II, are as different from each other as the reference BVDV (BVDV-NADL, BVDV-SD-1, BVDV-Osloss) of hog cholera virus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, based on the 5' untranslated region and the genomic region encoding the p125 polypeptide, were designed to differentiate between BVDV I and BVDV II. Using these tests, 76 of 140 BVDV isolates were identified as BVDV II. Antigenic and pathological differences were observed between BVDV I and BVDV II viruses. BVDV I included viruses commonly used in vaccine production, diagnostic tests, and research. BVDV II was predominantly isolated from fetal bovine sera, persistently infected calves born to BVDV-vaccinated dams, and cattle that had died of an acute form of BVDV called haemorrhagic syndrome.",,"Ridpath, J.

1766,Change in prevalence of bovine viral diarrhea virus subgenotypes among samples submitted to a diagnostic laboratory over a 20-year period.,"Although the causal agent of bovine viral diarrhea was initially classified as 1 species, phylogenetic analysis revealed that these viruses belong to 2 different species, bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1) and BVDV-2, with 2 to 11 subgenotypes within each species. . The distribution of species and subgenotypes has been shown to vary by geographic region. It is not known whether the distribution changes over time. Surveys conducted between 1994 and 2008 reported 3 subgenotypes circulating among cattle in the United States: BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b, and BVDV-2a. The average percentage prevalence of BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b, and BVDV-2a strains reported in surveys prior to 2001 was 21%, 43%, and 36%, respectively. Surveys conducted on viruses isolated after 2001 reported decreasing percentages of BVDV-1a and BVDV-2a strains, with BVDV-1b strains accounting for 75-100% of samples. Comparison of these surveys is confounded by differences in geographic location, collection methods, and the type of sample used in the survey. The purpose of the present study was to determine if the prevalence of BVDV subgenotypes changed in samples collected from the same geographic region and by the same laboratory over time. BVDV strains isolated in 1988, 1998, and 2008 at the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, Amarillo, Texas, were genotyped and the prevalence of BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b, and BVDV-2a strains was determined. Typing, based on phylogenetic analysis, was performed on 148 samples. The strongest trend detected among these samples was a pronounced decrease in the number of BVDV-1a strains over time.",,"Ridpath, J. F.;Lovell, G.;Neill, J. D.;Hairgrove, T.

1767,Isolation and characterization of a new cervid adenovirus from young white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a captive herd,"new adenovirus, CeAdV1, was isolated from buffy coat and nasal swab samples collected from two captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) pups. The isolation was an incidental finding in the course of selecting animals for use in a research study on an unrelated pathogen. In the selection process, virus isolation was performed in both nasal swabs and buffy coat samples, and a cytopathic effect was observed. Electron microscopy revealed viral particles with the shape and morphology of an adenovirus. Next-generation sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis classified this virus in the Mastadenovirus genus. Its sequence was genetically distinct from all other recognized species in this genus, with only 76% sequence identity with its closest genetic match, bovine adenovirus 3 (BAdV3). The virus was able to propagate in bovine-derived cells, but grew to a higher titer in cervid-derived cells. Inoculation of white-tailed deer pups with the isolated virus resulted in pyrexia, depletion of thymus tissue, and mild respiratory disease. Comparative serology performed with convalescent sera revealed clear antigenic differences between the new cervid adenovirus and BAdV3. A retrospective serologic survey of the captive deer herd indicated that this virus had been circulating in the herd for at least 14 years with no reports of clinical disease. A survey of serum collected from free-ranging mule deer residing in Nevada revealed high serum titers against this new adenovirus.",,"Ridpath, J. F.;Neill, J. D.;Palmer, M. V.;Bauermann, F.

1768,Genome Stability of Parainfluenza 5 Virus Revealed by Deep Sequencing of Strains Isolated from Different Hosts and After Passage in Cell Culture,"UNLABELED: Strain diversity of a rubulavirus, parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), was investigated by comparing 11 newly determined and 6 previously published genomic sequences. These sequences represent 15 PIV5 strains, of which 6 were isolated from humans, 1 from monkeys, 2 from pigs, and 6 from dogs. Strain diversity is remarkably low, regardless of host, year of isolation, or geographic origin; a total of 7.8% of the nucleotides are variable, and the mean pairwise difference between strains is 2.1%. The variation is unevenly distributed in the PIV5 genome, but no convincing evidence of selection for antibody-mediated evasion in hemagglutinin-neuraminidase was found. The finding that some canine and porcine, but not primate, strains are mutated in the SH gene and do not produce SH raised the possibility that dogs (or pigs) are not the natural host for PIV5. The genetic stability of PIV5 was also demonstrated during serial passage of one strain (W3) in Vero cells with a high multiplicity of infections, under conditions of competition with large proportions of interfering defective genomes. A similar observation was made for a mutant of strain W3 (PIV5VDELTAC) lacking V gene function, in which the dominant changes were related to pseudoreversion in this gene. Mutations detected in PIV5VDELTAC during pseudoreversion, as well as those characterizing the SH gene in canine and porcine strains, predominantly involve U to C transitions. This suggests an important role for hypermutation biased through adenosine deaminase-like activity, RNA-specific (ADAR). SIGNIFICANCE: Here we report the sequence variation of 16 different parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) isolates that were isolated from various species, including humans, monkeys, dogs, and pigs, over 4 decades. Surprisingly, strain diversity was remarkably low, regardless of host, year of isolation, or geographic origin. The variation was unevenly distributed in the PIV5 genome, but no convincing evidence of host or immune selection was found. This overall stability of the PIV5 genome was also observed when the virus was grown in the laboratory, and the genome remained remarkably constant even during virus mutant selection. Some of the canine isolates had lost their ability to code for one of the viral proteins, called SH, suggesting that although PIV5 commonly infects dogs, dogs may not be the natural host for PIV5.",,"Rima, B.

1769,New Minto virus: a new rhabdovirus from ticks in Alaska,"Three strains of a virus were isolated from Haemaphysalis leporis-palustris (Packard) ticks taken from snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben) in east central Alaska. We suggest that the virus be named New Minto after the location where the ticks were collected. Prototype New Minto virus is sensitive to sodium deoxycholate and kills suckling mice intracerebrally but not intraperitoneally; weanling mice do not die after intracerebral, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous inoculation. The virus produces plaque on serially propagated Vero cells, but not on primary cells of the Peking duck embryo. Through neutralization and complement fixation tests, New Minto is related to Sawgrass virus, a hitherto ungrouped virus from Florida. The establishment of a Sawgrass group is suggested. Furthermore, using electron microscopy it was discovered that the Sawgrass virus belongs to the Rhabdoviridae family.",,"Ritter, D. G.;Calisher, C. H.;Muth, D. J.",1978.0,,,0
1770,Multiple hosts and genetic admixture of influenza A viruses,"Influenza A viruses have a segmented negative-stranded RNA genome. These viruses are classified according to the antigenic properties of the two glycoproteins, expressed on the surface of the virus particles, hemagglutinin (HA or H) and neuraminidase (NA or N). To date, 17 H and 10N have been described and 116 combinations or subtypes of HxNy have been reported. Except for the recently identified H17N10 subtype in bats, all identified subtypes have been identified in wild waterfowl. These birds are considered the natural reservoir for influenza A viruses, some subtypes of which can be transmitted to other species of birds and mammals, including humans. Interspecies transmissions appear to occur regularly and can occasionally lead to adaptation and stable establishment of a new viral lineage in a given species. This review recalls the genetic diversity of avian, swine and human influenza viruses and focuses on the lesser known influenza A viruses, identified in horses, dogs and, very recently, in bats. Discusses the genetic admixture that can result from interspecies transmission and the associated risks of epizootics, zoonoses, and pandemics.",,"Rivailler, P.;Moisy, D.;Naffakh, N.",2013.0,,10.1684/vir.2013.0540,0
1771,Detection of Cattle Infected with Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus by Nucleic Acid Hybridization,"ribonucleic acid (RNA) hybridization assay for identifying cattle infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is described. The RNA probe was derived from the coding region at the 3' end of the genome of the NADL strain of BVDV. Total RNA was extracted from cultures of infected cells or peripheral blood leukocytes from suspect animals and applied to nylon membranes with a slot blot apparatus. Peripheral blood leukocytes were analyzed at the same time for BVDV by virus isolation. The results of hybridization and isolation of the virus coincided in 92% of the cases. When compared to virus isolation, hybridization had a detection sensitivity of 59.5% and a specificity of 95%. Cross-reactivity was observed with RNA extracts from cells infected with border disease virus. No cross-reactivity was detected with other common bovine viruses (bovine herpesvirus-1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus-3 and bluetongue virus), with viruses classified in related families (equine arteritis virus and equine encephalitis virus).

1772,First report of Apple mosaic virus in Alaska,"Apple mosaic virus (ApMV; family Bromoviridae, genus Ilarvirus) is one of the oldest and most economically important viruses of apples (Malus x domestica Borkh.) (1,3). Yield losses can range from negligible to 50%, depending on the cultivar affected. Although ApMV is found worldwide and occurs naturally in more than 65 plant species (1), it has not been reported to occur in Alaska. In July 2011, bright yellow mosaic leaves were observed on 'Valentine' apple and its 'Ranetka' root stalk from an apple orchard in Wasilla, AK. Leaves were harvested and analyzed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using ApMV-specific primers (2), and total RNA was extracted with buffer modifications in the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, 50 mg of leaf tissue were ground in liquid nitrogen and 450 μl of SE buffer (0.14 M NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 8 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O [pH 7.4], 0.05% vol/vol Tween-20, 2 % wt/vol polyvinylpyrrolidone 40, 0.2% w/vol ovalbumin, 0.5% w/vol bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% w/vol sodium azide) and, after vigorous stirring, were added 80 μl of the mixture to 400 μl of RLT buffer supplied by the kit and then processed according to the manufacturer's instructions (4). Direct sequencing of the predicted ~260 bp PCR product resulted in 97-98% nucleotide identities with the ApMV accessions in GenBank when analyzed by BLAST. To determine the distribution and incidence of infection in the Wasilla orchard, all 118 apple trees (99 cultivars) were sampled and serologically analyzed by double-antibody sandwich ELISA with ApMV antiserum according to the manufacturer's protocol (Agdia, Inc., Elkhart, EN). Apple 'Geneva Early' and the same 'Valentine' tree and its rootstock tested positive for ApMV by ELISA and RT-PCR. Strong diagnostic symptoms of ApMV were not apparent in infected 'Geneva Early', which is typical for most commercially grown apples. No leaves were available on the ApMV-infected 'Geneva Early' rootstock 'Ranetka' for virus indexing. Another 21 apple trees without symptoms from an orchard in Talkeetna, AK tested negative for ApMV by ELISA. Limited natural spread of ApMV to other plants may be by pollen and seed transmission. The most prevalent mode of transmission is from ApMV-infected rootstocks and grafts. It is important to obtain new plant propagation material from certified virus-tested nurseries and avoid grafting plant material containing ApMV. To my knowledge, this is the first report of ApMV in Alaska. References: (1) RW Fulton. No. 83. CMI/AAB Descriptions of plant viruses. 1972. (2) W. Menzel et al. J.Virol.",,"Robertson, N.

1775,Bovine leukemia virus can be classified into seven genotypes: evidence for the existence of two new clades,"Previous studies have classified bovine leukemia virus (BLV) provirus env sequences from different parts of the world into between two and four genetic groups. These different studies gave unique names to the identified groups and no study has yet integrated all available sequences. Therefore, we hypothesize that many of the different groups identified above actually correspond to a limited pool of genotypes that are unevenly distributed around the world. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the env gene from 28 BLV field strains and compared these sequences with 46 env sequences representing all genetic clusters already identified. Using phylogenetic analyses, we recovered six clades, or genotypes, which we call genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Genotypes 1-5 have counterparts among the groups of sequences identified above. One env sequence did not cluster with any of the others and was highly divergent compared to the six genotypes identified here. Therefore, there may be an additional genotype, which we call 7. The similarity comparisons were very consistent with the phylogenetic analyses. In addition, our analyzes confirmed the existence of geographic clusters. © 2009 SGM.",,"Rodriguez, S. M.;Golemba, M.

Lymph node samples from 4 PMWS-affected pigs and 2 healthy animals were collected and processed by transmission electron microscopy. Significant ultrastructural alterations were only observed in PMWS-affected pigs, mainly in histiocytes and rarely in other cell types. Histiocytes showed severe inflammation and proliferation of mitochondria, and proliferation and dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Infected histiocytes contained large numbers of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (ICI) with VLPs; some histiocytes also had intranuclear inclusions (INI). Small inclusions were surrounded by a double membrane, with a granular appearance or with paracrystalline arrangements; icosahedral VLPs were 8-17 nm in diameter. Large ICIs were either bounded by a double membrane or not and contained VLPs that normally formed paracrystalline arrays. ICIs were often found adjacent to, and within, severely inflamed mitochondria. INIs were not membrane-enclosed and contained virions 10-13 nm in diameter. Lymphocyte depletion was a surprising finding in the lymph nodes of PMWS-affected pigs. The VLP-containing inclusion bodies referenced in the present study should be classified as viral factories, suggesting that viral replication is likely a frequent event in macrophages, in which mitochondria might play a role.",,"Rodriguez-CariÃ±o, C.;SegalÃ©s, J.",2009.0,,,0

After reverse transcription, the genome at the 5' end, along with the same region from a sheep BD isolate, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned. The p20 gene region was sequenced and compared to published data for BVD and HC viruses. Several motifs were conserved in the amino acid sequences of all viruses. The porcine isolate had a higher degree of homology in this region with the BD isolate (87%) than with the BVD (73%) or HC (74%) viruses.

1780,Re-emergence of a new variant avian influenza virus H5N1 Subclade 2.2.1.1 in Egypt during 2014,"Large-scale surveillance is essential to understand the evolution and emergence of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in endemic areas. The circulation of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1 is causing significant economic losses to the Egyptian poultry industry and is a threat to public health. In this report, an H5N1 strain of HPAI (A/chicken/Egypt/Fadllah-7/2014) was detected in a vaccinated flock showing clinical signs of infection. Genetic characterization of the isolate indicated a high level of nucleotide identity (95-98%) with variant and classic groups of H5N1. Furthermore, multiple nucleotide and amino acid alignments revealed several prominent and characteristic substitutions in the surface glycoprotein, which may have biological relevance to the pathobiology of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the reported isolate is closely related to subclade 2.2.1.1 of AIV H5N1 despite the fact that there are no reports of this subclade since 2011 of reported cases of AI in Egyptian avian species. In conclusion, our results highlight the resurgence of a new variant of the AIV H5N1 subclade 2.2.1.1 that could escape vaccine-induced immunity. This discovery illustrates the importance of continued monitoring of poultry in this country to control AIV, including identifying sources of vaccine seed viruses.",,"Rohaim, M. A.;El-Naggar, R.

1781,Do the hemagglutinin genes of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses constitute unique phylogenetic lineages?,"Avian influenza A viruses of subtypes H5 and H7 periodically cause serious outbreaks of disease in poultry. The question we wanted to address in this study is whether these highly pathogenic strains constitute unique lineages or whether they and related nonpathogenic viruses are derived from common ancestors in the wild bird reservoir. Therefore, we compared the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the hemagglutinin (HA) genes of influenza A 15 H5 and 26 H7 viruses isolated over 91 years from a variety of host species in Eurasia, Africa, Australia, and North America. . Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the HA genes of H5 and H7 viruses that cause severe disease in domestic birds do not form single lineages but rather share common ancestors with nonpathogenic H5 and H7 viruses. These findings predict that highly pathogenic H5 and H7 avian influenza A viruses will continue to emerge from wild bird reservoirs. Another important question is whether H7 influenza viruses found in mammalian species are derived from avian strains. We included eight equine influenza viruses and one seal isolate in the phylogenetic analysis of H7 HA genes. We were able to show that HA genes from equine and seal viruses shared ancestors with avian H7 HA genes. This indicates that currently circulating H7 viruses with an avian HA gene may have the potential to adapt to mammalian species and cause an outbreak of influenza in the new host.",,"Rohm, C.;Horimoto, T.;Kawaoka, Y.;Suss, J.;Webster, R.

1782,454-pyrosequencing: a molecular battyscope for freshwater viral ecology,"Viruses, the most abundant biological entities on the planet, are capable of infecting organisms from all three branches of life, although most infect bacteria where the greatest degree of cellular diversity resides. However, the characterization and evaluation of viral diversity in natural environments is just beginning to become a possibility. Through the development of a novel technique for viral DNA collection and the application of 454 pyrosequencing, a snapshot of the diversity of DNA viruses collected from a standing pond on a cattle farm was obtained. A high abundance of viral genotypes (785) were present within the virome. The absolute numbers of lambdoid and Shiga toxin (Stx) encoding phages detected suggested that the depth of sequencing had allowed the recovery of only ca. 8% of the total virus population, numbers that matched within less than an order of magnitude the predictions made by rarefaction analysis. The most abundant viral genotypes in the pond were bacteriophages (93.7%). The predominant viral genotypes infecting higher life forms found in association with the farm were pathogens that cause disease in livestock and humans, eg, members of the Herpesviridae. The techniques and analysis described here provide a new approach to monitoring viral populations in the aquatic environment, with the potential to become an integral part of the development of risk analysis tools to monitor the spread of viral agents of animal disease. plant and human. © 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Rooks, D.

Nucleotide sequence alignments revealed a highly conserved gB gene, with homologies ranging from 87.2 to 99.6%, and a more variable gD gene, with homologies ranging from 71.3 to 98.9%. %. Phylogenetic analysis of gB and gD nucleotides and deduced amino acid sequences revealed that BHV-5 is the virus most closely related to the BHV-1 subtype 1 and BHV-1 subtype 2 group and that CapHV-1 is the most distantly related virus. . Phylogenetic data showed a close relationship of all viruses studied with suid herpesvirus 1. Based on gB gene sequence data, a nested PCR combined with restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of the PCR products was developed. for the simultaneous detection and identification of the viruses that were studied. Nested primers from highly conserved stretches of sequence were selected to amplify a 294 bp region in all five viruses, and subsequent REA of the PCR products allowed specific identification.

1784,Revisiting the taxonomy of the family Circoviridae: establishment of the genus Cyclovirus and elimination of the genus Gyrovirus,"The Circoviridae family contains viruses with covalently closed circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes, including smaller animal pathogens that replicate autonomously and encode the capsid. Members of this family are known to cause fatal diseases in birds and pigs and have historically been classified into one of two genera: Circovirus, which contains avian and swine pathogens, and Gyrovirus, which includes a single species (swine anemia virus). chickens). However, over the course of the last six years, viral metagenomic approaches, as well as detection of degenerate PCR in unconventional hosts and environmental samples, have elucidated a broader host range, including fish, a diversity of mammals, and invertebrates, for members of the Circoviridae family. . In particular, these methods have discovered a distinct group of viruses that are closely related to members of the Circovirus genus and comprise a new genus, Cyclovirus. The discovery of new viruses and a reassessment of the genomic features that characterize members of the Circoviridae prompted a revision of the classification criteria used for this family of animal viruses. Here we provide details on an updated Circoviridae taxonomy ratified by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses in 2016, which establishes the genus Cyclovirus and reassigns the genus Gyrovirus to the family Anelloviridae, a separate lineage of animal viruses that also contains circular ssDNA genomes. In addition, we provide a new species demarcation threshold of 80% genome-wide pairwise identity for members of the Circoviridae family, based on pairwise identity distribution analysis, and list guidelines for distinguishing between members of this family. and other eukaryotic viruses with circular ssDNA. genomes",,"Rosario, K.;Breitbart, M.;Harrach, B.;SegalÃ©s, J.;Delwart, E.;Biagini, P.;Varsani, A.",2017.0,,10.1007/s00705-017-3247-y,0
1785,Whitefly RNA Viral Metagenome Leads to the Discovery and Characterization of a North American Whitefly-Transmitted Carlavirus,"Whiteflies of the Bemisia tabaci species complex have the ability to transmit a large number of plant viruses and are some of the most damaging pests in agriculture. Although whiteflies are known to transmit both DNA and RNA viruses, most of the diversity has been recorded for the former, specifically for the Begomovirus genus. This study investigated the total diversity of DNA and RNA viruses found in whiteflies collected from a single site in Florida to assess whether there are additional previously undetected viral types within the B. tabaci vector. Metagenomic analysis of viral DNA extracted from whiteflies only resulted in the detection of begomoviruses. In contrast, whiteflies contained sequences similar to RNA viruses from divergent groups, with diversity extending beyond currently described viruses. Metagenomic analysis of whiteflies also led to the first report of a whitefly-borne RNA virus similar to cowpea mild mottle virus (CpMMV Florida) (genus Carlavirus) in North America. Further investigation resulted in the detection of CpMMV Florida in native and cultivated plants growing near the original whitefly collection field site and the determination of its experimental host range. Analysis of the complete CpMMV Florida genomes recovered from whiteflies and plants suggests that the current classification criteria for carlaviruses should be re-evaluated. Overall, metagenomic analysis supports that the DNA plant viruses carried by B. tabaci are dominated by begomoviruses, while much less is known about the RNA viruses present in this damaging insect vector. © 2014 Rosario et al.",,"Rosario, K.;Capobianco, H.;Ng, T.

The present study identified 10 novel ssDNA circovinus-like genomes through data mining of public viral metagenomes. The metagenomic libraries included reclaimed water samples and three different marine environments (the Chesapeake Bay, the coastal waters of British Columbia, and the Sargasso Sea). All genomes have similarities with the replication protein (Rep) of the circoviruses; however, only half have genomic characteristics consistent with known circoviruses. Some of the genomes exhibit a mix of genomic features associated with different families of ssDNA viruses (ie, circoviruses, geminiviruses, and parvoviruses). Unique genomic architectures and phylogenetic analysis of the Rep protein suggest that these viruses belong to new genera and/or families. Investigation of the complex community of ssDNA viruses in the environment may lead to the discovery of divergent species and help elucidate evolutionary links between ssDNA viruses.",,"Rosario, K.;Duffy, S.;Breitbart, M.",2009.0,Oct,,0
1787,The discovery of viruses in the three main lineages of terrestrial arthropods highlights the diversity of single-stranded DNA viruses associated with invertebrates.,"Viruses that encode a replication-associated protein (Rep) within a covalently closed single-stranded (ss) DNA genome are among the smallest viruses known to infect eukaryotic organisms, including economically valuable agricultural crops and livestock. Although circular Rep-encoded ssDNA (CRESS DNA) viruses are a widespread group for which our knowledge is rapidly expanding, sampling biased toward vertebrates and terrestrial plants has limited our understanding of their diversity and evolution. Here, we screen terrestrial arthropods for CRESS DNA viruses and report the identification of 44 viral genomes and specimen-associated replicons representing the three major lineages of terrestrial arthropods, namely Euchelicerata (spiders), Hexapoda (insects), and Myriapoda ( millipede). We identified virus genomes belonging to three established CRESS DNA viral families (Circoviridae, Genomoviridae, and Smacoviridae); however, more than half of the arthropod-associated viral genomes are distantly related to the currently classified viral CRESS DNA sequences. Although members of virus and satellite families known to infect plants (Geminiviridae, Nanoviridae, Alphasatellitidae) were not identified in this study, these plant-infecting viruses and CRESS DNA replicons are transmitted by hemiptera. Thus, members of six of the seven established CRESS DNA viral families circulate among arthropods. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of Reps, including endogenous viral sequences, reported to date from a wide range of organisms, revealed that most of the known CRESS DNA viral diversity circulates among invertebrates. Our results highlight the wide and unexplored diversity of CRESS DNA viruses among invertebrates and parallel findings from RNA virus discovery efforts in undersampled taxa.",,"Rosario, K.;Mettel, K.

1788,Challenges of the unknown: clinical application of microbial metagenomics,"The availability of rapid, high-throughput, low-cost whole genome sequencing holds great promise within public health microbiology, with applications ranging from outbreak detection and transmission event tracking to understanding the role that microbial communities play in health and disease. Within clinical metagenomics, the identification of microorganisms from a complex and host-enriched background remains a central computational challenge. As a proof of principle, we sequenced two metagenomic samples, a known viral mix of 25 human pathogens and an unknown complex biological model using benchtop technology. The data sets were then analyzed using a bioinformatics pipeline built around recent rapid classification methods. A targeted approach was able to detect 20 of the viruses in a context of host contamination from multiple sources and bacterial contamination. An alternative non-targeted identification method was highly correlated with these classifications, and more than 1,600 species were identified when applied to the complex biological model, including several captured species with more than 50% genome coverage. In summary, this study demonstrates the great potential of applying metagenomics within the clinical laboratory setting and that this can be achieved using the infrastructure available to non-dedicated sequencing centers.",,"Rose, G.;Wooldridge, D.

The main objective of this study was to identify associations between different RFLP types of PRRSV in herds. swine in southern Ontario and clinical signs of disease. in those herds. Herds included in the study submitted samples to the University of Guelph Animal Health Laboratory between September 2004 and August 2007. Each farm owner was surveyed to describe clinical disease in the herd and the RFLP pattern of each herd was obtained. a PRRSV isolate from a diagnostic sample. The most frequent isolates were RFLP types 1-4 (25.1%), 252 (14.7%), 134 (12%) and 1-2 (7.7%). The distribution of RFLP types in this study was found to be different from previous research in Ontario. The RFLP types most associated with clinical disease in the calving phase of production were 1-4, 1-2, and 134.

1790,Deep sequencing reveals abundant non-canonical retroviral microRNAs in B-cell leukemia/lymphoma,"Viral tumor models have contributed significantly to our understanding of oncogenic mechanisms. However, how transforming delta-retroviruses induce malignancy remains poorly understood, especially as viral mRNA/protein is strongly silenced in tumors. Here, using deep sequencing of wide windows of small RNA sizes in the bovine leukemia virus ovine leukemia/lymphoma model, we provide in vivo evidence for the production of viral microRNAs transcribed with non-canonical RNA polymerase III (Pol III). in leukemic B cells in the complete absence of Pol II 5â€²-LTR-driven transcriptional activity. Processed from a pool of five independent self-sustaining transcriptional units located in a proviral region dispensable for infectivity in vivo, bovine leukemia virus microRNAs represent ~40% of all microRNAs in both experimental and natural malignancies. They are subject to strong purifying selection and associate with Argonauts, consistent with a critical role in silencing important cellular and/or viral targets. Bovine leukemia virus microRNAs are strongly expressed in preleukemic and malignant cells in which structural and regulatory gene expression is repressed, suggesting a key role in tumor development and progression. Understanding how Pol III-dependent microRNAs subvert cellular and viral pathways will help unravel the intricate perturbations that underlie malignant transformation.",,"Rosewick, N.;Momont, M.;Durkin, K.;Takeda, H.;Caiment, F.;Cleuter, Y.;Vernin, C.;Mortreux, F.;Wattel, E.;Burny, A.;Georges, M.;Van Den Broeke, A.",2013.0,,10.1073/pnas.1213842110,0
1791,Ruminal bacteriophage metagenomics from thirteen lactating dairy cows,"Background: The bovine rumen harbors a diverse and complex community of Eukarya, Bacteria, Archea, and viruses (including bacteriophages). The viral population of the rumen (the rumen virome) has received little attention compared to the microbial population of the rumen (the rumen microbiome). We used massively parallel sequencing of virus-like particles to investigate rumen virome diversity in thirteen lactating Australian Holstein dairy cows, all housed at the same location, 12 of which were sampled on the same day. Results: Fourteen putative viral sequence fragments greater than 30 Kbp in length were assembled and annotated. Many of the putative genes in the assembled contigs did not show homology to previously annotated genes, highlighting the large amount of work that is still required to fully annotate the encoded functions in viral genomes. The abundance of contig sequences varied widely between animals, even though cattle were of the same age, stage of lactation, and fed the same diets. Furthermore, the twelve cohabiting animals shared several of their dominant viral contigs. We compared the functional characteristics of our bovine viromes with those of other viromes, as well as with rumen microbiomes. At the functional level, we found strong similarities between all the viral samples, which were very distinct from the ruminal microbiome samples. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a large amount of inter-animal variation in the bovine rumen virome and that cohabiting animals may have more similar viromes than non-cohabiting animals. We present the most extensive sequencing to date of the rumen virome. This work highlights the enormous amount of novelty and variation present in the rumen virome.",,"Ross, E.

1792,Identification and sequencing of the complete genome of paramyxoviruses in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) using random access amplification and next-generation sequencing technologies,"BACKGROUND: During a screening program for avian influenza A viruses (AIV) and avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) in wildlife in Belgium, we isolated two hemagglutinating agents from cloacal swab pools of wild mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) captured in a single sampling site at two different sites. times. AIV and APMV1 were excluded by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests and specific real-time RT-PCR tests. METHODS: To refine the virological identification of APMV2-10 performed by HI subtyping tests and in the absence of validated molecular tests for APMV2-10, random access amplification in combination with next-generation sequencing was used for sequence-independent identification. of viruses and the determination of their genomes. RESULTS: Three different APMV were identified. From a pooled sample, the complete genome sequence (15054 nucleotides) of an APMV4 was assembled from random sequences. From the second pooled sample, the almost complete genome sequence of an APMV6 (genome size of 16236 nucleotides) as well as a partial sequence of an APMV4 was determined. This APMV4 was closely related but not identical to the APMV4 isolated from the first sample. Although a cross-reactivity with other APMV subtypes did not allow formal identification, HI subtyping revealed APMV4 and APMV6 in the respective pooled samples, but failed to identify co-infecting APMV4 in the APMV6-infected pool. CONCLUSIONS: These data further contribute to the knowledge about the genetic diversity within serotypes APMV4 and 6, and confirm the limited sensitivity of the HI subtyping test. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the value of a random access nucleic acid amplification method in combination with massively parallel sequencing. Using only moderate and inexpensive sequencing effort, full genome characterization and sequencing of APMVs, including identification of viruses in mixed infections, can be obtained.",,"Rosseel, T.;Lambrecht, B.;Vandenbussche, F.;van den Berg, T.;Van Borm, S.",2011.0,2006-10-01 00:00:00,,0

Bioinformatic analysis of the data resulting from the DNA virus identification workflow (a total of 32,757 sequences with an average read length of 335 bases) initially demonstrated the presence of parvovirus-like sequences in the analyzed blood sample. Close follow-up using specific real-time RT-PCR assays targeting the detected sequence fragments confirmed the presence of these sequences in the original sample, as well as in a sample from an additional animal, but contamination with an identical genetic signature in negative extraction controls were demonstrated. Further investigation using an alternative extraction method identified contamination of the originally used Qiagen extraction columns with parvovirus-like nucleic acids or virus particles.

This virus was named Schmallenberg virus (SBV). Subsequently, the presence of the virus was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in cases of congenital malformations in cattle and sheep in several European countries, including Belgium. In the absence of specific sequencing protocols for this new virus, we confirmed its presence in RT-qPCR-positive field samples using SISPA DNase next-generation sequencing (NGS), a method of virus discovery based on random amplification and next-generation sequencing. generation. An in vitro transcribed RNA was used to construct a standard curve to allow quantification of viral RNA in field samples. Two field samples from aborted lambs containing 7.66 and 7.64 log(10) RNA copies per microL of total RNA allowed unequivocal identification of SBV. One sample returned 192 SBV reads covering approximately 81% of the L segment, 56% of the M segment, and 13% of the S segment. The other sample resulted in 8 reads spread across the L and M segments. Three field samples Weak positives (one from an aborted calf, two from aborted lambs) containing amounts of virus equivalent to 4.27-4.89 log(10) RNA copies per microL did not allow identification using SISPA-NGS DNase. This partial sequence information was compared to the complete genome sequence of SBV isolated from bovines in Germany, identifying several sequence differences. The applied viral discovery method allowed confirmation of SBV in RT-qPCR positive brain samples. However, the fact that SBV could not be confirmed in weak PCR positive samples illustrates the importance of selecting fresh and correctly selected field samples in any virus discovery method. Partial sequences derived from field samples showed several differences compared to sequences from cattle in Germany, indicating sequence divergence within the epidemic.",,"Rosseel, T.;Scheuch, M.;Hoper, D.;De Regge, N.;Caij, A.

About 17% of the Swedish population is immune to HEV, but few cases are reported each year, indicating that most infections are subclinical. However, clinical hepatitis E can also be missed. For identified cases, the source of infection is mostly unknown. In order to identify whether HEV can be spread from wild game, the prevalence of markers of past and/or current infection was investigated in serum and faeces samples collected from 260 hunted wild Swedish ungulates. HEV markers were found in 43 (17%) of the animals. The most frequently infected animal was moose (Alces alces) with 19 of 69 animals (28%) with HEV markers, followed by wild boar (Sus scrofa) with 21 of 139 animals (15%), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) with 2 out of 30 animals, the red deer (Cervus elaphus) with 1 out of 15 animals, and the fallow deer (Dama dama) with 0 out of 7 animals. The partial open reading frame 1 (ORF1) of the animal viral genomes was sequenced and compared with those of 14 endemic human cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that three humans were infected with HEV strains similar to those of wild boar.

1800,The potential of respiratory droplet-transmitted influenza A/H5N1 virus to evolve in a mammalian host,"Avian influenza A/H5N1 viruses pose a pandemic threat. As few as five amino acid substitutions, or four with rearrangement, could be sufficient for mammalian-to-mammalian transmission via respiratory droplets. From surveillance data, we found that two of these substitutions are common in A/H5N1 viruses, and therefore some viruses may require only three additional substitutions to become transmissible via respiratory droplets between mammals. We used a mathematical model of virus evolution within the host to study factors that might increase and decrease the probability that the remaining substitutions will evolve after the virus has infected a mammalian host. These factors, combined with the presence of some of these substitutions in circulating strains, make a virus that evolves in nature a potentially serious threat. These results highlight critical areas where more data is needed to assess and potentially prevent this threat.",,"Russell, C. A.;Fonville, J. M.;Brown, A. E.;Burke, D. F.;Smith, D. L.;James, S.

1801,H1N1 influenza viruses that vary widely in hemagglutinin stability are efficiently transmitted from pig to pig and to ferrets,"pandemic-capable influenza virus requires a hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein that is immunologically undetectable by most people and capable of supporting replication and transmission in humans. Stabilization of HA has been linked to the pandemic potential of 2009 pH1N1 in humans and airborne transmissibility of H5N1 in the ferret model. Pigs have served as an intermediate host for zoonotic influenza viruses, but the evolutionary pressure exerted by this host on HA stability was unknown. For more than 70 contemporary porcine H1 and H3 isolates, we measured the activation pH of HA over a range of pH 5.1 to 5.9 for H1 viruses and pH 5.3 to 5.8 for H3 viruses. Therefore, contemporary porcine isolates vary widely in HA stability, with values favored by both avian species (pH > 5.5) and humans and ferrets (pH <= 5.5). Using a pandemic H1N1 virus backbone (pH1N1) from early 2009, we generated three viruses that differed by one HA residue that only altered HA stability: WT (pH 5.5), HA1-Y17H (pH 6.0 ) and HA2-R106K (pH 5.3). All three replicated in pigs and were transmitted from pig to pig and pig to ferret. WT and R106 viruses maintained the HA genotype and phenotype after transmission. Y17H (pH 6.0) acquired HA mutations that stabilized the HA protein at pH 5.8 after transmission to pigs and 5.5 after transmission to ferrets. In general, we found that pigs support a wide pH range of HA activation for contact transmission and many recent isolates of porcine H1N1 and H3N2 have stabilized (human-like) HA proteins. This constitutes an increased risk of a pandemic and underscores the importance of continued surveillance and control efforts for swine viruses.",,"Russier, M.;Yang, G.;Marinova-Petkova, A.;Vogel, P.;Kaplan, B.

1802,"Discovery of an Expanded Set of Avian Leukosis E Subgroup Proviruses in Chickens Using Vermillion, a Novel Capture Pipeline and Sequence Analysis","Transposable elements (TEs), such as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), are common in vertebrate genomes. VREs are the result of retroviral infections of germ-line cells and, once integrated into the host's DNA, become part of the host's hereditary genetic material. ERVs have been attributed positive effects on host physiology, such as the generation of novel adaptive genetic variation and resistance to infection, as well as negative effects as agents of tumorigenesis and disease. The avian leukosis virus (ALVE) subgroup E family of chicken endogenous viruses has been used as a model system to study the effects of ERVs on host physiology, and approximately 30 distinct ALVE proviruses have been described in the Gallus gallus genome. In this report, we describe the development of a software tool, which we call Vermillion, and the use of this tool in combination with targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) to increase the number of known proviruses belonging to the ALVE family of ERV in the chicken genome 4 times, including expanding the number of known ALVE elements on chromosome 1 (Gga1) from the current 9 to a total of 40.

For the analysis, the fragments of the pol gene corresponding to reverse transcriptase and integrase of 494 and 233 bp in size, respectively, have been used. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed several clustered BLV variants with high bootstrap support in Russia and Ukraine. A new classification of BLV variants is suggested. Comparison of phylograms based on the polymorphism of the nucleotide sequences of the integrase and reverse transcriptase domains showed no topological conflicts.

1804,Serological differentiation of foot-and-mouth disease virus strains in relation to the selection of suitable vaccine viruses,"Serological differentiations for the purpose of selecting suitable vaccine strains or for advice on vaccine use attempt to predict whether a given vaccine/antigen is likely to induce antibodies that are protective against prevailing field strains. The purpose of such differentiations is not identical to that of virus classification. It is therefore proposed that the most appropriate measure of this relationship (r) is given by: r = activity of the serum against the heterologous strain (Field)/activity of the serum against the homologous strain (Vaccine). A comparison of the complement fixation test with virus neutralization test systems, i.e., metabolic inhibition (color), plaque reduction, a two-dimensional microneutralization cytopathic endpoint (microneutralization), and neutralization kinetics, showed that two test systems did not always give identical results. results. Experience has also shown that there is a good correlation in cattle between neutralizing serum titer and protection against challenge in both homologous and heterologous systems. It is possible to demonstrate a dose-response relationship between the vaccine antigen dose and the neutralizing serum titer. It is therefore suggested that the preferred test for comparison of strains for vaccine use be one based on the virus neutralization system. When comparing two virus strains, they should be assumed to be identical until it has been shown that they are probably different. For each test system, therefore, it is necessary to know the intrinsic test error so that the smallest difference between two test values that is statistically significant can be recognized. An analysis of the discriminant power of the various test systems used in our laboratory is presented. Experience has shown that the methods of handling and storing vaccine viruses can cause significant changes in the biophysical characteristics of the virus, for example, virulence, plaque morphology, behavior in the sucrose density gradient, including antigenic shift. and immunogenicity. Therefore, it is suggested that, to the extent possible, reference antisera be prepared to compare strains to evaluate the use of vaccines from strains currently used in vaccine production.",,"Rweyemamu, M.

1807,"Canid biotype rabies in wild dog (Lycaon pictus) and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) in Madikwe Game Reserve, South Africa in 2014-2015: diagnosis, possible origins, and implications for control","Both domestic and wild carnivore species are commonly diagnosed with rabies virus (RABV) infection in South Africa. Although the majority of confirmed cases of rabies in wild carnivore species are reported in the yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata), the rest are in other wild carnivores, including the endangered wild dog (Lycaon pictus). Lyssavirus infection was confirmed in two wild dogs and one spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) in the Madikwe Game Reserve, North West Province of South Africa, in 2014 and 2015, by direct fluorescent antibody test and immunohistochemistry. There have been no new introductions of wild dogs into the Madikwe Game Reserve for many years and the wild dogs were last vaccinated against rabies approximately 11 years before the incident. The first wild dog euthanized was the last survivor of a pack of 6, and the second was the last of a larger pack of 18, the rest of which either died with no carcasses found or the carcasses were too decomposed for sampling. Subsequent antigenic typing of the lyssaviruses indicated that they were canid RABVs. RABVs that originated from 22 wild carnivore species, 7 dogs and one goat, mostly from the North West province, were genetically characterized by targeting a partial region of the nucleoprotein gene. Nucleotide sequence analyzes of these viruses and two previously characterized RABVs confirmed that the outbreak viruses were also canid rabies, clustered phylogenetically with virus isolates originating from black-backed jackals recovered between 2012 and 2015 from the province of Northwest, and domestic dogs from neighboring communities. areas The source(s) of mortality and possible reservoir host(s) of the virus could only be speculated from data on numbers, movements and behaviors of specific predators, deaths, management of the park and the changing environmental ecology, which were closely monitored at Madikwe. for several years. The most likely sources of rabies were fence-line contacts between wild carnivores within the park, with domestic dogs or cats, and/or naturally occurring wild carnivores outside the park. The associated risk of zoonotic infection and threat to important and endangered predators can be mitigated through regional control of rabies primarily in domestic dogs and cats, as well as preventive vaccination of at-risk park employees and their pets. The importance of continued prophylactic protection against rabies through regular vaccination of endangered wild carnivores and shipping of carcasses for rabies diagnosis of any wild or domestic animal behaving unusual or found dead is emphasized. .",,"Sabeta, C.

1808,Characterization of a new subgenotype VIIl of Newcastle disease virus circulating in Iran,"Newcastle disease is an economically important and highly contagious disease that affects wild and domestic bird species. Despite extensive vaccination efforts within the poultry industry, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) outbreaks still occur causing significant economic losses. Rural chickens can act as a potential reservoir of VEN for commercial poultry due to poor biosecurity and inadequate vaccination. The aim of this study was to investigate the phylogenetic relationship and molecular characterization of eight NDV isolates from poultry in Iran during 2011-2013. The complete coding sequence of the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) genes of eight NDVs was determined and compared with other published NDVs. Based on the distances between populations and the phylogenetic topology between the available NDV categories, the Iranian isolates formed a new subgenotype VIIl distinct from the previous designated groups in genotype VII. Furthermore, the F and HN genes of the Iranian isolates shared high nucleotide sequence similarity with viruses isolated in China. All viruses tested contained a polybasic cleavage site motif (111G/RRRQKRâ†“F117), indicating that all isolates could be classified as a virulent pathotype. No mutation was observed in the neutralizing epitopes of the F protein. Analysis of the amino acids associated with the neutralizing antigenic sites within the HN protein revealed that all isolates exhibited a single amino acid (Q) at position 347. These results emphasize the need to strengthen biosecurity measures implemented in village flocks and practice a mandatory vaccination program for local poultry. In addition, the continuous monitoring of VEN in different bird species can help to better understand the evolution of this virus and prevent future panzootics.",,"Sabouri, F.;Vasfi Marandi, M.;Bashashati, M.",2018.0,,10.1080/03079457.2017.1376735,0
1809,Simultaneous identification of DNA and RNA viruses present in pig faeces by process-controlled deep sequencing,"BACKGROUND: Animal feces comprise a community of many different microorganisms including bacteria and viruses. Little information is available on the diversity of viruses present in pig faeces. Here we describe a protocol, which was optimized for the purification of the total fraction of viral particles from pig feces. Genomes of purified DNA and RNA viruses were simultaneously amplified by PCR and subjected to deep sequencing followed by bioinformatic analysis. The efficiency of the method was monitored using a process control consisting of three bacteriophages (T4, M13 and MS2) with different morphology and genome types. Defined amounts of bacteriophages were added to the sample and their abundance was assessed by quantitative PCR during the preparation procedure. RESULTS: The procedure was applied to a pooled fecal sample from five pigs. From this sample, 69,613 sequence reads were generated. All added bacteriophages were identified by sequence analysis of the reads. In total, 7.7% of the reads showed significant sequence identities with published viral sequences. They originated mainly from bacteriophages (73.9%) and mammalian viruses (23.9%); 0.8% of the sequences showed identities with plant viruses. The most abundant swine viruses detected were kobuvirus, rotavirus C, astrovirus, enterovirus B, sapovirus and picobirnavirus. In addition, sequence identities for the circular ssDNA virus associated with chimpanzee feces were identified. Genome-wide analysis indicates that this virus, tentatively designated pig faeces-associated circular ssDNA virus (PigSCV), represents a new swine virus. CONCLUSION: The established protocol allows the simultaneous detection of DNA and RNA viruses in pig feces, including the identification of hitherto unknown viruses. It can be applied in studies investigating the etiology, epidemiology and ecology of diseases. The implemented process control serves as quality control, ensures method comparability, and can be used for further method optimization.",,"Sachsenroder, J.;Twardziok, S.;Hammerl, J.

1810,"The general composition of the faecal virome of pigs depends on age, but not on feeding a probiotic bacterium.","Background: The porcine fecal virome, which comprises the community of viruses present in porcine feces, is complex and consists of porcine viruses, bacteriophages, transient plant viruses, and other minor virus species. Little is known about the factors that influence its overall composition. Here, the effect of the probiotic bacteria Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) NCIMB 10415 on the composition of pig fecal virome in a feeding trial of pigs with sows and their piglets, receiving the probiotic bacteria or not, was analyzed. Results: From 8 pooled fecal samples derived from the feeding trial, DNA and RNA virus particles were prepared and subjected to process-controlled next-generation sequencing, resulting in 390,650 sequence reads. On average, 14% of reads showed significant sequence identities with known viruses. The percentage of mammalian virus sequences detected was highest (55-77%) in samples from younger piglets and lowest (8-10%) in samples from sows. In contrast, the percentage of bacteriophage sequences increased from 22-44% in the youngest piglets to approximately 90% in the sows. The dominant mammalian viruses differed markedly between 12-day-old piglets (kobuviruses), 54-day-old piglets (boca, dependo, and pig faeces-associated small circular DNA virus [PigSCV]), and sows (PigSCV, circovirus, and ""circovirus""). similar"" to CB-A and RW-A viruses). In addition, the Shannon index, which reflects the diversity of sequences present in a sample, was generally higher for sows compared to piglets. No consistent differences could be identified in the composition of the virome between the virome of the group treated with the probiotic bacteria and the control group.Conclusion: The analysis indicates that the porcine fecal virome shows a high variability and that its general composition depends mainly on the age of the pigs.

To date, no studies have been performed to antigenically subtype PCV2 strains enclosing eight PCV2 groups. The present study aimed to antigenically subtype PCV2 and perform epitope competition analysis using monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Fourteen representative PCV2 strains from eight groups were tested with 20 mAbs (fifteen of them were generated against PCV2a strain Stoon-1010 and 5 of them against PCV2b strain 1147) in immunoperoxidase monolayer assays. Four mAbs reacted with all 14 PCV2 strains and one mAb reacted with all strains except one PCV2a-2C strain. One mAb reacted with all PCV2a strains except one PCV2a-2C strain and one mAb reacted with all PCV2b strains except one PCV2b-1C strain. Nine mAbs reacted with the PCV2b-1A/1B, PCV2a-2A, and PCV2a-2E strains. Three mAbs only reacted with the PCV2a-2A and PCV2a-2E strains. One mAb reacted specifically with PCV2b-1A/1B strains. This suggests that discrete antigenic differences exist between different PCV2 genetic clusters and that these clusters can be discriminated by using a panel of universal and cluster-specific mAbs. Six mAbs were selected for cross-competition analysis by competitive ELISA using PCV2 strain Stoon-1010. Six overlapping epitopes were identified on the PCV2 capsid protein.

DI particles are recognized for their role in inhibiting viral replication and for the impact they have on the production of infectious virions. To date, influenza virus DI particles have been reported primarily as a cell culture phenomenon and in experimentally infected embryonated chicken eggs. They have also been isolated from a respiratory infection of chickens. Using a sequencing approach, we characterized various subgenomic viral RNAs from human nasopharyngeal samples infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The distribution of these derived DI-like RNAs in vivo was similar to that of DIs in vitro, with the majority of defective RNAs generated from PB2 (segment 1) of the polymerase complex, followed by PB1 and PA. The lengths of the in vivo derived DI-like segments are also similar to those of known in vitro DI, and the in vivo derived DI-like segments share internal deletions of the same segments. The presence of identical DI-like RNAs in contact-bound patients is consistent with transmission between them.

1817,Characterization of a human H9N2 influenza virus isolated in Hong Kong,"Two H9N2 viruses were first isolated from humans in Hong Kong in 1999. The isolation of influenza viruses with a new hemagglutinin (HA) subtype drew the attention of health authorities around the world from the point of view of pandemic preparedness. Sequence analysis of the HA genes reveals that the HA of A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) is more closely related to that of A/quail/HK/G1/97 (H9N2) which contains internal genes similar to those of A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2). of Hong Kong virus/97 (H5N1). Phylogenetic and antigenic analyzes demonstrated diversity among H9 HA. A/Hong Kong/1073/99 was shown to cause a respiratory infection in Syrian hamsters, suggesting that the virus can replicate efficiently in mammalian hosts. We developed a whole virion test vaccine with a formalin-inactivated HK1073 grown in eggs. Intraperitoneal administration of the vaccine twice to hamsters conferred complete protection against challenge infection by the homologous virus grown in MDCK cells. The receptor specificity of HK1073 appeared different from that of other H9 subtype avian influenza viruses that preferentially recognize α-2,3-linked sialic acid. Hemagglutination of HK1073 with guinea pig erythrocytes was inhibited by α-2,3- and α-2,6-linked sialic acid-containing polymers. These data suggested that HK1073 had acquired a broader host range, including humans.

1821,Isolation and characterization of a new Rhabdovirus from a wild boar (Sus scrofa) in Japan,"novel rhabdovirus was isolated from the serum of a healthy Japanese wild boar (Sus scrofa leucomystax) and identified by rapid viral nucleic acid sequence determination (RDV) system, next-generation sequencing, and electron microscopy. The virus was tentatively named wild boar rhabdovirus 1 (WBRV1). Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome sequence indicated that WBRV1 is closely related to Tupaia rhabdovirus (TRV), which was isolated from cultured cells of tree shrew hepatocellular carcinoma tissue. TRV has not been assigned to any genus of the Rhabdoviridae to date. Analysis of the L gene indicated that WBRV1 belongs to the genus Vesiculovirus. These observations suggest that both TRV and WBRV1 belong to a new genus of Rhabdoviridae. Next-generation genome sequencing of WBRV1 revealed 5 open reading frames of 1329, 765, 627, 1629 and 6336 bases in length. The WBRV1 gene sequences are similar to those of other rhabdoviruses. Epizootiological analysis of a wild boar population in Wakayama prefecture in Japan indicated that 6.5% were positive for the WBRV1 gene and 52% were positive for WBRV1 neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, such viral neutralizing antibodies were found in domestic pigs in another prefecture. WBRV1 was inoculated intranasally and intraperitoneally into SCID and BALB/c mice and viral RNA was detected in SCID mice, suggesting that WBRV1 can replicate in immunocompromised mice. These results indicate that this new virus is endemic in wild animals and livestock in Japan.",,"Sakai, K.;Hagiwara, K.;Omatsu, T.;Hamasaki, C.;Kuwata, R.;Shimoda, H.;Suzuki, K.;Endoh, D.;Nagata, N.;Nagai, M.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Kurane, I.;Saijo, M.;Morikawa, S.;Mizutani, T.;Maeda, K.",2015.0,1930-09-01 00:00:00,,0
1822,Bunyaviruses are common in male and female Ixodes scapularis ticks in central Pennsylvania,"The black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis is widely distributed in the United States and transmits multiple pathogens to humans, wildlife, and domestic animals. Recently, several new viruses of the Bunyaviridae family (South Bay virus (SBV) and Black-legged tick phlebovirus (BTPV)) were identified that infected female I. scapularis ticks collected in New York State. We used metagenomic sequencing to investigate the distribution of viruses infecting male and female I. scapularis ticks collected in Center County, Pennsylvania. We identified both SBV and BTPV in male and female ticks from all collection sites. The role of male I. scapularis in pathogen epidemiology has been overlooked because they rarely bite and are not considered important pathogenic vectors. However, males can act as reservoirs for pathogens that can then be transmitted to females during mating. Our data highlight the importance of examining all possible pathogen maintenance and transmission pathways throughout the vector-pathogen life cycle to understand the epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens.",,"Sakamoto, J.

The 5' untranslated region (UTR) amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was determined by direct sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was performed from the nucleotide sequence data. Most swine isolates fell into two main subgroups, subgroup 1 (CSFV-1, represented by the Brecia strain) and subgroup 2 (CSFV-2, represented by the Alfort strain) of classical swine fever virus ( CSFV). However, the Japanese Kanagawa/74, Okinawa/86, Okinawa/86-2, and Thai CBR/93 strains were the most distinct variants and were assigned to another disparate new subgroup, CSFV-3 (represented by strain p97). Most ruminant isolates were classified as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) genotype-I (BVDV-I) and subdivided into two subgroups, BVDV-Ia (represented by the NADL strain) and Ib (represented by the NADL strain). Osloss strain). Two bovine isolates (MS-1 and SY-89) and one contaminating strain (V/FLL) of an ovine cell line were classified as BVDV genotype II (BVDV-II) based on genetic characteristics.

1824,"Viral RNA load in patients with tick-borne encephalitis, Slovenia","We determined tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus (TBEV) RNA levels in serum samples obtained from 80 patients during the early phase of TBE in Slovenia. For most samples, the levels were within the range of 3 to 6 log(10) RNA copies/mL. Levels were higher in female patients than in male patients, but we found no association between virus load and various clinical and laboratory parameters, including TBE severity. However, a weak humoral immune response was associated with a more severe disease course, suggesting that inefficient virus clearance results in more severe disease. To determine whether a certain TBEV genetic lineage had increased virulence potential, we obtained 56 partial envelope protein gene sequences by direct sequencing of reverse transcription PCR products from clinical patient samples. This method provided a large set of patient-derived TBEV sequences.

1825,Alternative Growth Promoters Modulate the gut microbiome of broilers and improve body weight gain,"Antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) are frequently used to improve weight gain in poultry production. However, there has been growing concern about the impact of AGP on the emergence of antibiotic resistance in zoonotic bacterial pathogens in the avian gut microbial community. In this study, we adopted shotgun mass spectrophotometry, phylogenetic, and metagenomic approaches to evaluate bioactive phenolic extracts (BPE) from blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) and blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) pomace as AGP alternatives in broilers. We conducted two trials with 100 Cobb-500 broilers (in each trial) in four equal groups that were given water without supplementation, supplemented with AGP (tylosin, neomycin sulfate, bacitracin, erythromycin, and oxytetracycline), or supplemented with 0.1 g Gallic Acid Equivalent (GAE)/L or 1.0 g GAE/L (during the last 72 h before euthanasia) of BPE for 6 weeks. Compared to the control group (water only), chickens supplemented with AGP and 0.1 g GAE/L BPE gained 9.5 and 5.8% more body weight, respectively. The microbiomes of chickens treated with AGP and BPE had higher ratios of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. AGP supplementation appeared to be associated with a higher relative abundance of bacteriophages and single cecal resistomes compared to BPE supplementation or control. Functional characterization of the cecal microbiomes revealed significant animal-to-animal variation in the relative abundance of genes involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism. These findings established a baseline upon which the mechanisms of plant-derived performance enhancers in regulating animal growth can be investigated. In addition, the data will help design alternative strategies to improve animal growth performance and, consequently, production.",,"Salaheen, S.;Kim, S. W.;Haley, B. J.;Van Kessel, J. A.

Most of the accessions came from 11 countries representing different agroclimatic zones in sub-Saharan Africa and included landraces, local cultivars and breeding lines. After initial fattening tests, 69 accessions of cowpeas, mostly with symptoms of virus infection, were selected for further evaluation using a combination of host range, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ) and sequence analysis. Analyzes revealed that samples from 46 (67%) accessions harbored one or more known seed-borne cowpea viruses. These included accession seed samples originating from Botswana (13 accessions), Ghana (6), Nigeria (6), Mali (1), Kenya (5), Cameroon (7), Niger (4), Ivory Coast (1 ), Benin (1), India (1), and China (1).

1828,The sequence of a complete chicken BG haplotype shows the dynamic expansion and contraction of two gene lineages with particular expression patterns,"Many genes important in immunity are found as multigene families. The butyrophilin genes are members of the B7 family and play various roles in co-regulation and perhaps in antigen presentation. In humans, a fixed number of butyrophilin genes are found in and around the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and they show a striking association with particular autoimmune diseases. In chickens, the BG genes encode homologues with a somewhat different domain organization. Only a few BG genes have been characterized, one involved in the actin-myosin interaction in the intestinal brush border and another involved in resistance to viral diseases. We characterized all BG genes in B12 chickens, finding a multigene family organized as tandem repeats in the BG region outside the MHC, a single gene in the MHC (the BF-BL region), and another single gene on a different chromosome. There is a precise cellular and tissue expression for each gene, but in general there are two types, those expressed by hemopoietic cells and those expressed in tissues (presumably non-hemopoietic cells), which correlate with two different types of promoters and untranslated regions of 5 inches. (5â€²UTR). However, the multigene family in the BG region contains many hybrid genes, suggesting that recombination and/or deletion are the main evolutionary forces. We identified BG genes in the chicken whole genome shotgun sequence as well as in comparison to other haplotypes by fiber fluorescence in situ hybridization, confirming dynamic expansion and contraction within the BG region. Therefore, BG genes in chickens are undergoing much more rapid evolution compared to their mammalian counterparts, for reasons that are not yet known. © 2014 Solomonsen et al.",,"Salomonsen, J.;Chattaway, J.

A sequence analysis of the full-length mRNA encoding the fusion glycoprotein (F0) precursor of the NDV F1 and F2 fusion proteins in these six isolates showed the presence of point mutations in the form of nucleic acid substitutions in the positions 82 (Câ†'T), 83(Tâ†'C), 736(Aâ†'G) and 1,633(Gâ†'A). However, nucleic acid residues at positions 330-347 of the precursor F0 gene, corresponding to the F0 protein cleavage site, were found to remain conserved among the six NDV isolates.

1830,Phylogenetic Analysis of Lumpy Skin Disease Viruses in Northwest Iran,"Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a devastating viral disease of cattle that has recently spread from Africa to countries in the Middle East. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between contagious nodular skin disease (LSDV) viruses isolated from different regions of Iran and the origin and spread of these viruses. In this study, a total of 234 blood samples from clinically affected animals from four northwestern provinces of Iran were tested for LSDV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). From 80 samples positive for LSDV detected by PCR, the partial P32 gene (759 bp) of 12 isolates was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. LSD viruses were grouped into three subgroups with an overall nucleotide identity of 97.1-100%. The LSDVs isolated from Gilan showed the lowest nucleotide identity with the other LSDVs. Four LSDV isolates, including KO-1, EA-1, EA-3 and WA-3, showed 100% similarity to each other and also to the Neethling strain. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the identified LSDVs were closely related to each other and had high sequence homology to other LSDV isolates from Africa. It was concluded that the LSD outbreak likely occurred in northwestern Iran by LSDVs that entered the country from Iraq and the P32 nucleotide sequence information obtained in the present study is a valuable resource for understanding the genetic nature and molecular epidemiology. of the local isolates of LSDV that can be used. for the future development of vaccines based on the strains circulating in the region.",,"Sameea Yousefi, P.;Dalir-Naghadeh, B.;Mardani, K.;Jalilzadeh-Amin, G.",2018.0,,10.1007/s11250-018-1634-3,0
1831,A blood signature of four biomarkers discriminates systemic inflammation due to viral infection versus other etiologies,"The innate immune system of humans and other mammals responds to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are conserved across broad classes of infectious agents, such as bacteria and viruses. We hypothesize that a blood-based transcriptional signature could be discovered that indicates a systemic host response to viral infection. Previous work identified host transcriptional signatures for individual viruses, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and dengue, but the generality of these signatures across all types of viral infections has not been established. Based on 44 publicly available data sets and two clinical studies of our own design, we discovered and validated a four-gene expression signature in whole blood, indicative of a general systemic host response to many types of viral infection. The signature genes are: interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), interleukin 16 (IL16), 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL), and adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E5 (ADGRE5). In each of the 13 validation data sets spanning humans, macaques, chimpanzees, pigs, mice, rats, and the seven Baltimore virus classification groups, the signature provides statistically significant discrimination (p<0.05) between viral and nonviral conditions.

1832,Complete Genome Sequence of Avian Paramyxovirus (APMV) Serotype 5 Completes Analysis of Nine APMV Serotypes and Reveals Longest APMV Genome,"Background: Avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) consist of nine known serotypes. The genomes of representatives of all APMV serotypes except APMV type 5 have recently been completely sequenced. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of the prototype strain APMV-5 budgerigar/Kunitachi/74. Methodology/ Main Findings: APMV-5 Kunitachi virus is unusual in that it lacks virion hemagglutinin and does not grow in the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs. However, the virus grew in the amniotic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs and in twelve different established cell lines and two primary cell cultures. The genome is 17,262 nucleotides (nt) long, which is the longest among members of the Avulavirus genus, and encodes six non-overlapping genes on the order of 3â€²N-P/V/WMF-HN-L-5â€² with intergenic regions from 4-57 nt. The genome length follows the 'rule of six' and contains a 55 nt leader sequence at the 3″ end and a 552 nt trailing sequence at the 5″ end. The phosphoprotein (P) gene contains a conserved RNA editing site and is predicted to encode P, V, and W proteins. The F protein cleavage site (GKRKKR â†“ F) fits the site motif division of the ubiquitous cellular protease furin. Consistent with this, no exogenous protease was required for virus replication in vitro. However, the intracerebral pathogenicity index of the Kunitachi strain of APMV-5 in day-old chicks was found to be zero, indicating that the virus is not virulent for chickens despite the presence of a target site. polybasic division F. Conclusions/Significance: Phylogenetic analysis of the genome and protein sequences of APMV-5 versus those of the other APMV serotypes showed that APMV-5 is more closely related to APMV-6 than to the other APMVs. Furthermore, these comparisons provided evidence of a wide genome-wide divergence supporting the classification of APMVs into nine separate serotypes. The structure of the F cleavage site does not appear to be a reliable indicator of virulence among APMV serotypes 2-9. The availability of sequence information for all known serotypes of APMV will facilitate studies in epidemiology and vaccination.",,"Samuel, A. S.;Paldurai, A.;Kumar, S.;Collins, P. L.;Samal, S.

Here, we develop a comprehensive set of occurrence data to map the current distribution, estimate the ecological niche, and explore the potential future distribution of BTV globally using ecological niche models and based on various future climate scenarios from general circulation models (GCMs). ) for four representative concentration pathways (RCP). The broad ecological niche and potential geographic distribution of BTV under current conditions reflect the current distribution of the disease throughout the world in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. All model predictions were significantly better than random expectations. As a further assessment of the robustness of the model, we compared our model predictions with 331 independent records of the most recent outbreaks from the Food and Agriculture Organization's Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Pest and Disease Information System. Animals and Plants (EMPRES-i); all were successfully anticipated by the BTV model. Finally, we tested for ecological niche similarity between potential vectors and BTVs, and were unable to reject the niche similarity hypotheses.

1835,Screening of porcine sera for functional antibody titers against influenza a neuraminidase proteins using an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA),"Neuraminidase (NA) is an envelope glycoprotein of influenza viruses, including influenza A viruses of swine lineage. NA possesses sialidase activity, which is functionally important at multiple points in viral replication, counteracting the sialic acid receptor-binding activity of hemagglutinin (HA), the other major envelope glycoprotein. The NA proteins of influenza A viruses have been classified into nine serological subtypes and undergo antigenic drift variation similar to that of HA. NA antibodies are tested much less frequently than HA antibodies. The conventional assay for NA inhibition antibody (NI) titration, established decades ago, is generally considered unwieldy and inefficient for routine use. In recent years, some new formats have been developed that still measure inhibition of NA enzymatic function, but more efficiently and with less chemical waste produced. Described here is the enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA), which is performed in 96-well plates and analyzed on a spectrophotometric plate reader. An important factor in adopting the ELLA technique for studies in animals, such as pigs, is the choice of the NA antigen, which can be a purified protein or a whole virus containing an antigenically irrelevant HA protein.

1839,"Genetic characterization of small ruminant lentiviruses circulating in naturally infected sheep and goats in Ontario, Canada.","Maedi-visna virus (MVV) and caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) are related members of a group of small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) that infect sheep and goats. SRLVs are endemic in many countries, including Canada. However, very little is known about the genetic characteristics of Canadian SRLVs, particularly in the province of Ontario. Given the importance of surveillance and eradication programs for SRLV control, it is imperative that diagnostic tests used to identify infected animals be sensitive to local SRLV strains. The objective of this work was to characterize the SRLV strains circulating in Ontario and to evaluate the variability of the immunodominant regions of the Gag protein. In this study, the nearly complete gag sequence of 164 SRLVs, from 130 naturally infected sheep and 32 naturally infected goats from Ontario, was sequenced. The animals were from distantly located single and mixed species (sheep and goat) farms. Ovine lentiviruses from the same farm tended to cluster closer together than goat lentiviruses from the same farm. Sequence analysis revealed a higher degree of heterogeneity between goat lentivirus sequences with a mean pairwise DNA distance between farms of 10% and only 5% in the ovine lentivirus group. Interestingly, amplification of SRLV from ELISA-positive sheep was successful in 81% of cases, whereas amplification of SRLV proviral DNA was only possible in 55% of samples from ELISA-positive goats; suggesting that a significant portion of the goat lentiviruses circulating in Ontario possess heterogeneity in the primer binding sites used in this study. SRLV sequences from Ontario sheep and goats were assembled into phylogenetic trees with other known SRLVs and were found to belong to sequence groups A2 and B1, respectively, as defined by Shah et al. (2004a). A new caprine lentivirus was identified with a pairwise genetic difference of 15.6-25.4% relative to other group B subtypes. Therefore, we suggest designation of a new subtype, B4, within the lentivirus-like group. goat. Lastly, we demonstrate evidence of recombination between ovine lentiviruses. These results emphasize the wide genetic diversity of SRLV strains circulating in the province of Ontario and show that the gag region is suitable for phylogenetic studies and can be applied to monitor SRLV eradication programs. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",,"Santry, L.

The new complete genome of SWPV-1 from A. carneipes is missing 43 genes compared to CNPV and contains 4 predicted genes not found in any other poxvirus, whereas the complete genome of SWPV-2 was considered to be missing 18 genes compared to CNPV and 15 other genes they were significantly fragmented as to probably cause them to be non-functional. CONCLUSION: These are the first complete genome sequences of avipoxviruses that infect seabirds. In comparing SWPV-1 and -2 with existing avipoxvirus sequences, our results indicate that the complete SWPV genome of A. carneipes (SWPV-1) described here is not closely related to any other avipoxvirus genome isolated from birds or other natural hosts. species, and should probably be considered a separate species.",,"Sarker, S.;Das, S.;Lavers, J.

1841,"Genetic variations of the hemagglutinin gene of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) viruses in Assam, India during 2016","Since its appearance in 2009, the influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus has continuously evolved. Marked genetic variations have occurred in the HA1 domain of the hemagglutinin gene, leading to the appearance of new variants. The present study genetically characterized the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of Influenza A/H1N1pdm09 strains from Assam circulating in 2016 and causing a mild outbreak with no reported mortality. HA gene sequence analysis of 20 positive Assam/H1N1pdm09 strains revealed 3 mutations (K180Q, 5202T, S220T) at the antigenic sites along with several other reported mutations that are in close proximity to the antigenic sites and thus could affect viral antigenicity. Phylogenetically, the Assam/H1N1pdm09 strains were grouped into genogroup 6B. These genetic variations highlight the importance of continued surveillance and characterization of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus activity to track genetic makeup and diversification that may affect virus behavior.",,"Sarmah, K.;Borkakoty, B.;Sarma, K.;Hazarika, R.;Das, P.

1844,How to classify Inuenza A viruses and understand their severity,"As an application of the degree of chaos introduced in the framework of the adaptive dynamics of information, we study the classification of Influenza A viruses. What evolutionary processes determine the severity and transmission capacity of influenza A viruses between humans? We performed phylogenetic classifications of influenza A viruses that were sampled between 1918 and 2009 using a measure called the degree of entropic chaos, which was developed through the study of chaos in information dynamics. Phylogenetic analysis of the internal protein (PB2, PB1, PA, NS, M1, M2, NS1, and NS2) indicated that influenza A viruses that adapt to humans and are transmitted between humans are clearly distinguished from the swine and avian lineage. In addition, the HA, NA, and internal proteins of the influenza strain that caused a pandemic or severe epidemic with high mortality were phylogenetically different from previous pandemic and severe epidemic strains. We have concluded that the internal protein has a significant impact on the ability to transmit between humans. Based on this study, we are convinced that the degree of entropic chaos is very useful as a measure to understand the classification and severity of an influenza A virus isolate.",,"Sato, K.;Tanabe, T.;Ohya, M.",2010.0,Sep,,0
1845,Xanthate antiviral activities,"Strategies in antiviral development have been directed at developing substances to preferentially interact with virus-encoded enzymes, eg, polymerases and reverse transcriptase. Xanthates, antiviral/antitumor agents with different modes of action, selectively interact with cellular proteins that regulate cell growth through phosphorylation pathways mediated by protein kinase C. These regulatory processes appear to be essential for the growth of several taxonomically unrelated viruses. The xanthate structures at the R1 position were substituted with cyclic and non-cyclic aliphatic residues, and at the R2 position with an alkali metal. The antiviral effect of such substitutions was evaluated in plaque reduction assays using herpes virus as a rapid and reliable test system. The cytotoxicity criterion was based on the ability of logarithmically growing cell cultures to undergo active mitotic divisions. The R1 position must be occupied by a lipophilic substituent which must be structurally constrained as mono, bi and tricyclic residues. The specific antiviral activity of xanthate compound D609 expressed by its IC50 compares well with that of other herpes inhibitors, eg, phosphonoformic acid (10 uM) or phosphonoacetic acid (20 uM). Unlike the herpes virus, which encodes its own DNA polymerase, the 'SV40' DNA tumor virus depends on cellular DNA polymerase for its DNA replication. There was a selective antiviral effect of xanthate in the absence of cytotoxicity of cells transformed with bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1). The inhibition of viral gene functions by xanthate in the absence of deleterious effects on indispensable cell functions shows the high selectivity of the antiviral effect. Depending on the multiplicity of coxsackievirus B4, there was a direct correlation of the amount of viral proteins synthesized despite the presence of D609. In the case of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), xanthate did not restrict the synthesis of primary transcripts that, being endowed with positive chain polarity, serve as messengers. The antiviral effect of xanthate occurs only under acidic pH; otherwise the antiviral/antitumor effects are diminished. As HIV-1 replicates only in the appropriate lymphoma cells displaying the properties of transformed cells, careful calibration of monocarbonic acid/D609 concentration had to precede antiviral therapy. Such treatment inhibits the spread of infectious HIV from lymphoma cultures that chronically produce virus. This is the only compound to prevent the spread of HIV infections from carrier cultures. D609 acts antagonistically to the effect of the tumor-promoting compound TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate). The effects of D609 are not directed at pkc itself. Phospholipase C appears to be the main target. Diacylglycerol, the product of phospholipase C activity, is missing in cells treated with D609. D609 interacts in a very specific mechanism with the growth signal transduction sequence. Transaction mechanisms may lack biological activity as xanthate blocks pkC activity responsible for proper phosphorylation of these parameters. Bolus injections of D609 together with monocarbonic acid exert therapeutic effects in tumor xenografts in nude mice when D609/undecanoic or dodecanoic acid are administered. This compound can be applied at very high concentrations intravenously.",,"Sauer, G.;Amtmann, E.;Mellert, W.",1989.0,,,0
1846,A member of a new genus Picornaviridae is shed in pig faeces,"During a study of the fecal microbiomes of two healthy piglets using high-throughput sequencing (HTS), we identified a viral genome that contained an open reading frame encoding a predicted polyprotein of 2133 amino acids. This new viral genome showed the typical organization of picornaviruses, with three structural proteins (VP0, VP3, and VP1), followed by seven non-structural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3Cpro, and 3Dpol). Given its particular relationship to Parechovirus, we propose naming it ""Pasivirus"" for the virus from Parecho's sister clade, with ""Swine pasivirus 1"" (SPaV1) as the type species.

During bluetongue surveillance activities, we identified a putative new serotype of BTV in healthy goats from Sardinia, Italy. RNAs purified from blood and serum samples were positive for BTV by generic real-time RT-PCR and c-ELISA, respectively, while genotyping and serotyping were unsuccessful. Using NGS, the complete genome sequence was obtained from two blood samples (BTV-X ITL2015 strains 34200 and 33531). In general, segment 2 of BTV-X ITL2015 shows the highest identity (75.3-75.5% nt/77.4-78.1% aa) with BTV-27 recently isolated from Corsica and with the latest BTV XJ1407 discovered from China (75.9% nt/78.2% aa), while it is less related to BTV-25 from Switzerland (73.0% nt/75.0% aa) and BTV-26 from Kuwait (62, 0% nt/60.5% aa). In this study, a specific RT-qPCR targeting Seg 2 of BTV-X ITL2015 was evaluated. Taking into account the Seg 2/VP2 identity of BTV-X ITL2015 with BTV-25, 26, 27s and BTV XJ1407 and that the serum of goats infected with BTV-X ITL2015 failed to neutralize all the existing serotypes analyzed, we propose the existence of a new BTV serotype circulating in goats in Sardinia.

1850,Origin of the 1957 pandemic influenza A H2 virus and persistence of its possible progenitors in the avian reservoir,"Influenza A H2N2 viruses caused the 1957 Asian pandemic and then disappeared from the human population 10 years later. To assess the potential for similar outbreaks in the future, we determined the antigenicity of H2 hemagglutinins (HA) from representative human and avian H2 viruses and then analyzed the nucleotide and amino acid sequences for their evolutionary characteristics in different hosts. Results from longitudinal virus surveillance studies were also examined to estimate the prevalence of avian H2 isolates among samples collected from wild ducks and domestic poultry. Reactivity patterns obtained with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies indicated an antigenic drift in the HA of human influenza H2 viruses from 1962 onwards. The amino acid changes were clustered in two regions of HA1 corresponding to the antigenic sites A and D of HA H3. In contrast, the antigenic profiles of most avian H2 HAs were remarkably conserved until 1991, resembling the prototype strain Japan 57 (H2N2). The amino acid changes were distributed throughout HA1, indicating that antibodies do not play an important role in the selection of avian H2 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two site-specific geographic lineages of avian H2 HA: North American and Eurasian. Evidence is presented to support interregional transmission of H2 viruses from gulls. The human H2 HAs that circulated in 1957-1968 form a separate phylogenetic lineage, most closely related to the avian H2 HAs of Eurasia. There was an increased prevalence of H2 influenza viruses among wild ducks in 1988 in North America, before the appearance of H2N2 viruses in domestic birds. As the prevalence of H2N2 avian influenza viruses increased in turkey farms and live bird markets in New York City and elsewhere, more of these viruses came into direct contact with susceptible humans . We conclude that antigenically conserved counterparts of the 1957 human Asian pandemic strain continue to circulate in the avian reservoir and are increasingly close to susceptible human populations.",,"Schafer, J.

The polypeptide migrated abnormally after electrophoresis in two sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) systems: more slowly than bovine serum albumin in a continuous phosphate-buffered system and more rapidly than bovine serum albumin in a batch system. The estimated molecular weights in the two systems were approximately 71,000 and 64,000, respectively. There was no clear evidence of a minor virion polypeptide. Treatment of purified San Miguel fur seal virions with dimethyl suberimidate, a crosslinking reagent, preserved virion integrity during long-term storage at 4°C. Oligomeric species of the polypeptide were observed after electrophoresis of cross-linked virion products.

Although the involvement of porcine NoVs in pig disease is unclear, they are genetically and antigenically closely related to human NoVs. Human strains similar to NoV have been detected in pigs, raising public health concerns about potential cross-species transmission. Porcine SaVs are highly diverse and emerging in swine populations. Recently, at least three new porcine SaV genogroups have been proposed. In this study, we analyzed 413 pooled fecal samples collected from apparently healthy finishing pigs on pig farms in North Carolina during 2009. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR coupled hybridization assays were performed to detect known porcine NoVs. The overall prevalence of swine NoV was determined to be 18.9% by this method. Samples were then analyzed by RT-PCR directed at the 5= end of the capsid region for genogroup II (GII) NoVs, a group that includes human NoVs, followed by sequence analysis. All identified NoVs belonged to typical porcine NoV genotypes, and no human NoV-like strains were detected in samples from these pigs. NoV-negative swine samples (n = 335) were subsequently screened using calicivirus universal primers and 17 SaV strains were confirmed by sequencing.

These include ungulate protoparvovirus 1 (classical porcine parvovirus, PPV), ungulate tetraparvovirus 2 (PPV3), ungulate tetraparvovirus 3 (including PPV2, porcine hokovirus, porcine partetravirus, and porcine PARV4), ungulate copiparvovirus 2 (including PPV4 and PPV5), bocaparvovirus 2 (which includes porcine bocaviruses 1, 2, and 6), hoofed bocaparvovirus 3 (porcine bocavirus 5), hoofed bocaparvovirus 4 (porcine bocavirus 7), and hoofed bocaparvovirus 5 (porcine bocavirus 3, 4-1, and 4-2 ). PPV6, the most recently described porcine parvovirus, was first identified in China in late 2014 in aborted pig fetuses. The prevalence of PPV6 in China was found to be similar in finishing-age pigs from farms with and without evidence of swine reproductive failure. Methods: Porcine parvovirus 6 (PPV6) was detected by sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and confirmed by overlay and real-time PCR in serum from porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSv)-positive samples. Results: Seven near-complete PPV6 genomes were identified in PRRSV genotype 2-positive serum samples submitted to state veterinary diagnostic laboratories in 2014. Additional testing with overlay and real-time PCR determined that PPV6 was present in 13, 2% of the analyzed sera. Additionally, PPV6 was present in samples from all geographic locations sampled spanning nine states in the United States and one state in Mexico. The presence of PPV6 in serum indicates that the PPV6 infection is disseminated and not localized to a specific tissue type. Near-complete genome, NS1, and capsid gene alignments identified one of five PPV6 isolates from China (98.6-99.5% identity to North American strains) as the closest relative of the strains. North Americans. Conclusions: These results are the first to report the presence of PPV6 in North America and demonstrate that the virus is found in multiple geographic areas in the United States and Mexico.

1860,Detection of a new bovine astrovirus in a cow with encephalitis,"Encephalitis can be caused by various infectious agents, including bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. In many cases, the causative agent cannot be identified because the pathogens are unknown or detection methods are not routinely available. In our case, a 15-month-old cow developed central nervous system disorders and died within 6 days of the onset of clinical signs. Histopathology revealed acute encephalitis, predominantly in the brainstem, and ganglionitis of the trigeminal ganglion with massive neuronal necrosis in both the brain and the ganglion. However, a relevant panel of bacterial and viral infections of cattle could be routinely excluded. Therefore, a brain sample from the cow was analyzed using a metagenomics approach with next-generation sequencing. A novel bovine astrovirus (BoAstV-BH89/14) could be identified using the RIEMS assay pipeline, and the finding could be confirmed with a specific BoAstV RT-qPCR. The bovine astrovirus (BoAstV) genome, belonging to the Astroviridae family of the Mamastrovirus genus, is 6478 bp long. Sequence identities were determined between 71% with a sheep astrovirus and 69% with two recently described bovine astroviruses from the US and Switzerland. The latter were also related to cases of bovine encephalitis.

A specific DNA product of approximately 150 bp could be amplified and used as a hybridization probe against the CIV gene library to identify the corresponding gene. The gene encoding DdRP was identified within the EcoRI M (7099 bp) and L (7400 bp) fragments of CIV DNA, between map units 0.310 and 0.347 (7990 bp). The DNA nucleotide sequence (3153 bp) of the gene encoding the largest subunit of DdRP (RPO1) was determined. Northern blot hybridization revealed the presence of a 3.4 kb RNA transcript in CIV-infected cells that hybridized with the CIV DdRP gene. This predicted viral protein consists of 1051 amino acid residues (120K) and showed considerably greater similarity to the larger subunit of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II than to homologous proteins from vaccinia virus and African swine fever virus. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the putative CIV RPO1 might have evolved from RNA polymerase II after the divergence of the three types of eukaryotic RNA polymerases. The putative CIV RPO1 lacked the C-terminal domain that is conserved in eukaryotic, eubacterial, and other viral RNA polymerases, and in this respect was analogous to Archaea RNA polymerases. It is hypothesized that the C-terminal domain equivalent may reside in another CIV DdRP subunit encoded by an unidentified viral gene.",,"Schnitzler, P.;Sonntag, K.

1863,Molecular evolution of influenza viruses,"There are two different mechanisms by which influenza viruses can evolve: (1) Because the RNA genome of influenza viruses is segmented, new strains can be produced suddenly by reassortment, as occurs, for example, during antigenic shift, creating new pandemic strains. (2) New viruses evolve relatively slowly by gradual mutation and selection, for example during antigenic or genetic drift. Influenza A viruses have been found in several vertebrate species, where they form reservoirs that do not mix easily. Although human influenza A viruses do not spread in birds and vice versa, the species barrier for pigs is relatively low, so pigs could function as 'mixing vessels' for the creation of new pandemic rearrangements in Southeast Asia, where the probability is higher for double infection of pigs with human and avian influenza viruses. Phylogenetic studies revealed that about 100 years ago, an avian influenza A virus had crossed the species barrier, presumably first to pigs, and from there to humans, forming the new stable classical human and pig lineages. In 1979, again, an avian virus appeared in the pig population of northern Europe, forming another stable pig lineage. Isolates from northern European pigs from 1979 to about 1985 were genetically extremely unstable. A hypothesis is proposed that a mutator mutation is necessary to allow the influenza virus to cross the species barrier by providing the new host with enough variants from which it can select the best fit. As long as the mutator mutation is still present, such a virus should be able to cross the species barrier a second time, as it did about 100 years ago. Although the most recent swine isolates from northern Germany are again genetically stable, we must be vigilant to see if a swine virus from northern Europe appears in the human population in the near future.",,"Scholtissek, C.",1995.0,,10.1007/bf01728660,0
1864,Influenza A virus nucleoprotein analysis for evaluation of molecular genetic mechanisms leading to new phylogenetic virus lineages,"The nucleoprotein (NP) gene of influenza A viruses is critical in separating two large reservoirs that evolve individually in birds and humans. A phylogenetic analysis of the NP gene revealed that all mammalian influenza viruses originated, directly or indirectly, from an avian ancestor. The stable introduction of an avian influenza A virus into a mammalian species appears to be a relatively rare event, the last occurring in 1979 when such an avian virus was introduced into pigs in northern Europe, leading to a new lineage. At least two concomitant events are required for such a new and stable introduction: (1) the new species has to become infected and (2) a mutation in the polymerase complex has to establish a labile variant, which is likely to provide a large number of different variants, some of which can quickly adapt to the new host (or any unusual environment). Since such mutant mutations may be advantageous only during periods of stress, variants with a less error-prone polymerase could arise again after adaptation. Examples of such fluctuations in terms of mutational and evolutionary rates are discussed in this brief review.",,"Scholtissek, C.;Ludwig, S.;Fitch, W. M.",1993.0,,,0
1865,Characterization of the complete genome of the Tupaia adenovirus (tree shrew),"Members of the family Adenoviridae are widespread among vertebrate host species and normally cause acute but harmless infections. Particular attention is paid to adenoviruses due to their ability to transform host cells, their potential application in vector technology, and their phylogeny. The primary structure of the genome of Tupaia adenovirus (TAV), which infects Tupaia spp. (tree shrew) was determined. Taxonomically, tree shrews are assumed to be at the base of the mammalian phylogenetic tree and are frequently used as laboratory animals in behavioral and neurological research. The TAV genome is 33,501 bp long with a G+C content of 49.96% and has 166 bp terminal inverted repeats. Full nucleotide sequence analysis resulted in the identification of 109 open reading frames (ORFs) with a coding capacity of at least 40 amino acid residues. Thirty-eight of them are predicted to encode viral proteins based on the presence of transcription and translation signals and conservation of sequence and position. Thirty viral OPFs were found to show significant similarities to known adenoviral genes, organized into discrete early and late genomic regions as known from mastadenoviruses. Analysis of the nucleotide content of the TAV genome revealed a significant depletion of CG dinucleotides at the ends of the genome suggesting methylation of these genomic regions during the viral life cycle. Phylogenetic analysis of viral gene products, including penton and hexon proteins, viral protease, terminal protein, VIII protein, DNA polymerase, IVa2 protein, and 100,000 molecular weight protein, revealed that the evolutionary lineage TAV forms a separate branch within the phylogenetic tree of the genus Mastadenovirus.",,"Schondorf, E.;Bahr, U.;Handermann, M.;Darai, G.",2003.0,Apr,,0
1866,"Metagenomic Survey of Viruses in Western Arctic Caribou, Alaska, Through Iterative Assembly of Taxonomic Units","Animal pathogen surveillance does not provide a sufficient level of surveillance because it is generally limited to surveillance of pathogens with known economic impact in domestic animals and practically non-existent in wildlife species. Since the majority of (re)emerging viral infections originate from animal sources, it is important to obtain information on the viral pathogens present in the wildlife reservoir from a public health perspective. When monitoring free-living wildlife for viruses, sample collection can be challenging and the availability of nucleic acids isolated from samples is often limited. The development of viral metagenomics platforms allows for a more complete inventory of viruses present in wildlife. We present a metagenomic viral study of the barren ground caribou herd (Rangifer tarandus granti) from the western Arctic in Alaska, USA. The presence of mammalian viruses in eye and nose smears from 39 free-ranging caribou was investigated by random amplification. combined with a metagenomic analysis approach that applied exhaustive iterative assembly of sequencing results to define the taxonomic units of each metagenome. Through homology search methods, we identified the presence of several mammalian viruses, including different papillomaviruses, a new parvovirus, polyomavirus, and a virus potentially representing a member of a new genus in the Coronaviridae family.",,"SchÃ¼rch, A.

1867,Holstein Friesian lethal haplotype 5 (HH5) results from a complete deletion of TBF1M and cholesterol deficiency (CDH) from an insertion of ERV-(LTR) in the APOB coding region,"BACKGROUND: With the availability of massive SNP data for several economically important cattle breeds, haplotype testing has been performed to identify unknown recessive disorders. Several so-called lethal haplotypes have been discovered in Holstein Friesian cattle, and for at least seven of them, the causative mutations have been identified in candidate genes. However, several lethal haplotypes remain elusive. Here we report the molecular genetic causes of lethal haplotype 5 (HH5) and cholesterol deficiency (CDH). Targeted enrichment for known genomic regions was used, followed by massively parallel sequencing to interrogate causative mutations in a case-control approach. METHODS: Targeted enrichment for known genomic regions was used, followed by massively parallel sequencing in a case-control approach. PCRs for the causative mutations were performed and compared to routine imputation in 2100 (HH5) and 3100 (CDH) bovines. RESULTS: HH5 is caused by a 138 kbp deletion, spanning position 93,233 kb to 93,371 kb on chromosome 9 (BTA9), harboring only dimethyl-adenosine transferase 1 (TFB1M). The deletion breakpoints are flanked by long interspersed Bov-B (upstream) and L1ME3 (downstream) core elements, suggesting a homologous recombination/deletion event. TFB1M dimethylates adenine residues in the hairpin loop at the 3' end of mitochondrial 12S rRNA, and is essential for the synthesis and function of the small ribosomal subunit of mitochondria. Homozygous TFB1M-/- mice reportedly exhibit embryonic lethality with developmental defects. An allele frequency of 2.8% was determined for the German HF population. CDH results from a 1.3 kbp insertion of an endogenous retrovirus (ERV2-1-LTR_BT) in exon 5 of the APOB gene at BTA11:77.959 kb. The insert is flanked by 6-bp target site duplications as described for retroviral integrase-mediated insertions. A premature stop codon is generated in the open reading frame of APOB, resulting in a truncation of the protein to a length of only <140 amino acids. Such early truncations have been shown to cause an inability for chylomicron excretion from intestinal cells, resulting in cholesterol malabsorption. The allele frequency of this mutation in the German HF population was 6.7%, which is substantially higher than reported so far. Compared to PCR assays that infer genetic variants directly, the routine imputation used so far showed a diagnostic sensitivity of only 91% (HH5) and 88% (CDH), with high specificity for both (> =99.7%). CONCLUSION: With the availability of direct genetic testing, it will now be possible to more effectively reduce carrier frequency and ultimately eliminate the disorders from HF populations. In addition to this, the fact that repetitive genomic elements (REs) are involved in both diseases underlines the evolutionary importance of ERs, which can be detrimental as here, but also advantageous over generations.",,"Schutz, E.;Wehrhahn, C.;Wanjek, M.;Bortfeld, R.;Wemheuer, W.

1868,Norovirus animales,"Among enteric caliciviruses, noroviruses belong to the genus Norovirus, one of four accepted genera in the family Caliciviridae. These positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses are highly variable both genetically and antigenically. Several animal enteric caliciviruses have been identified that are morphologically indistinguishable from and genetically closely related to human noroviruses. The first bovine enteric noroviruses were described in Great Britain and are known as Newbury Agent 2. At least three genetic groups of porcine noroviruses coalesce into genogroup II noroviruses. Human noroviruses are the most important cause of acute gastroenteritis in people of all ages. In the US, they are associated with approximately 30-50% of all foodborne outbreaks. To date, noroviruses have not been associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis in immunocompetent animals. Neither bovine nor porcine noroviruses can replicate in cell culture, although human noroviruses can grow in a complex 3D culture system. However, recently discovered murine noroviruses can replicate in cell culture and are therefore used as model viruses to study human noroviruses. This review focuses on virus classification, virion structure, pathogenesis, epidemiology, immune response, and diagnosis of animal noroviruses compared to human noroviruses. The classification of animal enteric caliciviruses within the genus Norovirus raises the question of whether transmission from an animal reservoir to humans could occur. Answering this question is important in determining the risk of cross-species infections that affect the epidemiology and evolution of these viruses and thus complicate the control of human norovirus infections.",,"Scipioni, A.;Mauroy, A.;VinjÃ©, J.;Thiry, E.",2008.0,,10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.11.012,0
1869,Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence analysis of fusion protein and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein genes among Newcastle disease virus isolates. Phylogenetic relationships among Paramyxovirinae based on binding glycoprotein sequences,"Highly virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates are List A pathogens for commercial poultry, and reports of their isolation among member countries should be submitted to the Office of International Epizootics (OIE). The virus is classified as a member of the order Mononegavirales in the family Paramyxoviridae of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae. Two interactive surface glycoproteins, fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins, play essential roles in the attachment and fusion of NDV cells during infection. Antibodies against the F or HN proteins are capable of neutralizing the virus; however, complete sequences for these genes are not available from recently obtained virulent isolates. Therefore, the predicted nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the F and HN protein genes of 16 NDV isolates representing highly virulent viruses from worldwide sources were obtained for comparison with older virulent isolates and vaccine strains. The amino acid sequence of the F protein was relatively conserved among isolates that retained potential glycosylation sites and C residues for disulfide bonds. A dibasic amino acid motif was present at the cleavage site among the most virulent isolates, while low virulence viruses did not have this sequence. However, a Eurasian collared pigeon virus had a K114Q substitution at the F cleavage site unique among NDV isolates. The HN protein among the NDV isolates maintained the predicted catalytic and active site residues required for neuraminidase activity and hemagglutination. The HN length for the Eurasian collared turtledove isolate and a previously reported virulent heat-resistant isolate was longer relative to other more recent virulent isolates. Phylogenetically, NDV isolates separated into four groups with the most recent virulent isolates forming a diverse branch, while all avian paramyxoviruses formed their own distinct clade from other members of the Paramyxoviridae. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"Seal, B.

1870,Characterization of Newcastle Disease Virus Vaccines Using Biological Properties and Sequence Analysis of the Hemagglutinin-neuraminidase Protein Gene,"Six commercially available live monovalent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccines were examined for their biological and genomic stability compared to their declared parent virus. Hemagglutinin thermostability at 56°C for 5 min was consistently observed for most vaccine viruses. One exception was a recently developed NDV vaccine isolated from turkeys that had a thermostability of 15 min. Neuraminidase activity, as measured by the elution rate of agglutinated red blood cells, varied between vaccine viruses and correlated with that of the original isolate. Virulence, as measured by the intracerebral pathogenicity index, ranged from 0 to 0.39 among NDV vaccinia viruses, well within the range of avirulent lentegens. The fusion protein cleavage site sequence of all examined NDV vaccine isolates was consistent with that of lentegens. The complete sequence of the hemagglutinin-neurominidase gene was 98% similar among all NDV vaccine viruses examined, and the phylogenetic classification of commercial vaccine types correlated with their respective parent viruses. Consequently, the commercially produced NDV vaccines reported here appear relatively stable when mass-produced in embryonated avian eggs.",,"Seal, B. S.;King, D. J.;Bennett, J.

1871,The avian response to Newcastle disease virus,"Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is classified as a member of the Mononegavirales superfamily in the Paramyxoviridae family. This family of viruses is divided into two subfamilies, Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae. In 1993, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses rearranged the order of the genus Paramyxovirus and placed NDV within the genus Rubulavirus among the Paramyxovirinae. The enveloped virus has a 15,186 kb negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome that encodes an RNA-directed RNA polymerase, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein, fusion protein, matrix protein, phosphoprotein, and nucleoprotein in the 5' to 3' direction. The virus has a wide host range and most bird orders have been reported to be infected by NDV. Isolates are characterized by their virulence in chickens and are classified into three main pathotypes based on disease severity. Lentegenic isolates are of low virulence, while viruses of intermediate virulence are called mesogenic. Highly virulent viruses that cause high mortality in birds are called velogenic neurotropic or viscerotropic. Velogenic NDV is a List A pathogen that must be reported to the Office of International Epizootics and outbreaks result in strict trade embargoes. The main molecular determinant of NDV pathogenicity is the amino acid sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site. Vaccination against NDV is mainly done through mass application of live virus vaccines among commercial poultry. Although protection is measured by the presence of antibodies against NDV, chickens vaccinated with reduced B cells are resistant to the disease. Consequently, immune protection involves responses that are currently not fully defined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Seal, B. S.;King, D. J.;Sellers, H.

1872,Amino acid sequence predicted by the fusion protein of the first US avian pneumovirus isolate and lack of heterogeneity among other US isolates.,"Avian pneumovirus (APV) was first isolated from turkeys in the west-central US following the emergence of turkey rhinotracheitis (TRT) during 1996. Subsequently, several APV isolates were obtained in the north-central USA. The matrix (M) and fusion (F) protein genes of these isolates were examined for sequence heterogeneity and compared to European APV subtypes A and B. Among the US isolates, only one US isolate. Although the F gene among US APV isolates shared 98% nucleotide sequence identity, nine conserved substitutions were detected in the predicted amino acid sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence of the F protein from the US APV isolate had 72% sequence identity to APV subtype A F protein and 71% sequence identity to subtype B F protein of APV. This compares with an 83% sequence identity between APV subtype A and B predicted F protein amino acid sequences. The US isolates were phylogenetically distinguishable from their European counterparts based on F gene nucleotide or predicted amino acid sequences. The lack of sequence heterogeneity among US APV subtypes indicates that these viruses have maintained a relatively stable population since the first TRT outbreak.

USA. These isolates were characterized as APMV-1 by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using NDV-specific polyclonal antisera. However, the isolates did not react with a monoclonal antibody that has specificity for a wide variety of APMV-1 isolates. Although only highly virulent isolates require reporting to international regulatory agencies, the ability to correctly identify APMV-1 types is important for control and regulatory purposes. Protein gel patterns of purified isolates resembled previously reported APMV-1 and polyclonal anti-NDV sera recognized viral proteins. For three isolates, oligonucleotide primers specific for the NDV nucleoprotein, fusion protein, and polymerase genes were used to synthesize cDNA using viral RNA as template. Approximately 12 kb of the genome were subsequently sequenced for the three isolates, including the nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix protein, fusion (F) protein, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein, and a 5” portion of the gene. the polymerase.

1874,Evolutionary history and phylogeography of rabies viruses associated with outbreaks in Trinidad,"Bat rabies is an emerging disease of public health importance in the Americas. The Caribbean island of Trinidad experiences periodic outbreaks within the livestock population. We perform molecular characterization of the Trinidadian rabies virus (RABV) and use a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to investigate the extent to which outbreaks are the result of in situ evolution versus importation of the virus from the nearby South American mainland. RABV sequences from Trinidad were confirmed as bat variants and clustered with sequences related to Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat). They fell into two largely temporally defined lineages designated Trinidad I and II. The Trinidad I lineage that included sequences from 1997 to 2000 (all but two from the northeast of the island) was most closely related to the RABV from Ecuador (2005, 2007), French Guiana (1990), and Venezuela (1993, 1994). ). Trinidad II comprised sequences from the southwest of the island, which were grouped into two groups: Trinidad IIa, which included a sequence from 2000 and 2007, and Trinidad IIb, which included all sequences from 2010. The Trinidad II sequences were more closely related with the sequences of Brazil (1999, 2004) and Uruguay (2007, 2008). Phylogeographical analyzes support three separate introductions of RABV from the mainland from which each of the three Trinidad lineages arose. Estimated dates for introductions and subsequent lineage expansions suggest periods of in situ evolution within Trinidad after each introduction. These data also indicate the co-circulation of lineage I and IIa from Trinidad during 2000. In light of these findings and the likely origin of the Trinidad RABV in vampire bats, further studies should be conducted to investigate the relationship between the spatio-temporal dynamics of the RABV and population ecology of vampire bats. in particular any movement between the mainland and Trinidad.",,"Seetahal, J.

Chicken meat is considered the main source of human infection; however, C. jejuni and C. coli have also been reported in a variety of livestock and wildlife species, including pheasants. Wild pheasant meat reaches the consumer's table due to hunting, but information on the risk of Campylobacter infection in humans is lacking. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter in wild game pheasants in Scotland, to identify the main sequence types (ST) present and to assess their impact on public health. A total of 287 cecal samples were collected from five Scottish regions during the 2013/2014 hunting season. Campylobacter was detected and enumerated using standard culture methods. PCR and High Throughput Multi Locus Sequence Typing (HiMLST) were used for species identification and sequence typing. In total, 36.6% of 287 cecal samples (n = 105, 95% CI: 14-59.2) were positive for Campylobacter. By PCR, 62.6% of the samples (n = 99) were identified as C. coli and 37.4% as C. jejuni.

Recently, astrovirus brain infections have been identified in humans and neurologically diseased animals by NGS, including bovine astrovirus (BoAstV) CH13/NeuroS1, which has been found in brain tissues of cattle with nonsuppurative encephalitis. Only a few studies on neurotropic astroviruses are available and a causal relationship between BoAstV CH13/NeuroS1 infections and neurological disease has been postulated but not yet proven. With the aim of taking a step forward in the evaluation of causality, we collected brain samples from 97 cases of cattle diagnosed with unresolved non-suppurative encephalitis, and analyzed them by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, to determine the frequency and neuropathological distribution. of BoAstV CH13/ NeuroS1 and its topographical correlation with pathology. We detected BoAstV CH13/NeuroS1 RNA or protein in neurons in all parts of the central nervous system (CNS) in 34% of all cases, but none in control cattle. In general, brain lesions had a high correlation with the presence of the virus. These findings show that a substantial proportion of cattle with non-suppurative encephalitis are infected with BoAstV CH13/NeuroS1 and further support the causal relationship between neurological disease and astrovirus infections.",,"Selimovic-Hamza, S.;Boujon, C.

Four bacteriophage cocktails were prepared using 13 bacteriophages, and the lytic ability of the four bacteriophage cocktails was tested using Salmonella reference strains and field isolates. Bacteriophage cocktail C (SEP-1, SGP-1, STP-1, SS3eP-1, STP-2, SChP-1, SAP-1, SAP-2; ≥109 pfu/ml) showed the best lytic activity against Salmonella reference strains (100% of 34) and field isolates (92.5% of 107). Fifty mice were then orally inoculated with bacteriophage cocktail C to determine the distribution of bacteriophages in various organs, blood, and feces. The effects of bacteriophages on Salmonella infection in weanling pigs (n=15) were also evaluated by an experimental challenge with Salmonella Typhimurium after treatment with bacteriophage cocktail C.

1883,Genetic diversity of Newcastle disease virus in Pakistan: a national perspective.,"Background: Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the deadliest diseases of poultry worldwide. The disease is endemic in Pakistan and recurrent outbreaks are regularly reported in rural, commercial and captive wild poultry flocks. Although efforts have been made to characterize the causative agent in some parts of the country, the genetic nature of the strains circulating throughout Pakistan is currently lacking. Material and methods. To determine the genetics of NDV, 452 blood samples were collected from 113 herds, coming from all provinces of Pakistan, showing high mortality (30-80%). The samples represented domesticated birds (broilers, layers, and country birds) as well as captive wild birds (pigeons, turkeys, pheasants, and peafowl). Samples were screened with real-time PCR for matrix and fusion genes (1792 bp), positive samples were subjected to full-length fusion gene amplification and subsequent sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Results: The deduced amino acid sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site indicated the presence of the motif (112RK/RQRRâ†“F117) typical of velogenic NDV strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the fusion gene hypervariable region indicated that all isolates belong to NDV lineage 5 except isolates collected in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province. Higher resolution of lineage 5 phylogenetic analysis showed the distribution of NDV strains from Pakistan in 5b. However, the KPK isolates belonged to the 4c lineage; the first report of such a lineage from this province. Conclusions: Taken together, the data indicated the prevalence of multiple NDV lineages in different poultry populations, including captive wild birds. Such an understanding is crucial to inform the nature of circulating NDV strains, their potential for interspecies transmission, and disease diagnosis and control strategies. © 2013 Shabbir et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Shabbir, M.

1884,Comparative analysis reveals frequent recombination in parvoviruses,"Parvoviruses are small single-stranded DNA viruses that are ubiquitous in nature. Autonomous and helper virus-dependent parvovirus infections are common in both human and animal populations, with many animals harboring several different parvovirus species. Despite the epidemiological importance of parvoviruses, the presence and role of genome recombination within or between parvovirus species have not been well characterized. Here we show that natural recombination can be widespread in these viruses. The different regions of the genome of both porcine parvoviruses and Aleutian mink disease viruses have conflicting phylogenetic histories, providing evidence for recombination within each of these two species. Furthermore, rodent parvoviruses show complex evolutionary histories for separate genomic regions, suggesting interspecies-level recombination. © 2007 SGM.",,"Shackelton, L.

1885,Phylogenetic analysis and reclassification of caprine and ovine lentiviruses based on 104 new isolates: evidence for regular sheep-to-goat transmission and global spread through livestock trade,"We performed a phylogenetic analysis of goat and sheep lentiviruses using long gag and pol sequences from 104 new Swiss isolates and six sequences from available corresponding databases. Forty-five isolates, forming five groups of sequences, were not classifiable by the present classification. Pairwise DNA distance analysis indicated different categories of relatedness, requiring a new classification system. We propose four main groups of sequences, AD, which differ by 25-37%. Groups A and B are further divided into subtypes that differ by 15-27%. Group D and four of the seven subtypes of group A, A3, A4, A5 and A7, are made up of new Swiss isolates. Molecular epidemiology revealed that Swiss B1 strains differed no more from French, Brazilian, or US strains than from each other, suggesting spread of the virus through international livestock trade. Furthermore, infection of goats with the A3 or A4 subtypes was significantly associated with documented contact with sheep, which also harbor these subtypes, indicating that sheep-to-goat transmission occurs regularly. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The same viral agents have also been detected in healthy flocks, questioning their role in health and disease. To better understand eukaryotic viruses in the gut, this project focused on evaluating alternative methods for purifying and concentrating viral particles, that do not involve the use of density gradients, to generate viral metagenome data. In this study, the sequence results of three tissue processing methods were evaluated and a line of data analysis for gastrointestinal tract RNA viruses was established. Furthermore, using the best method and further sequencing depth, a glimpse of the viral RNA community in the gastrointestinal tract of a clinically normal 5-week-old turkey is presented. Viruses from the Reoviridae and Astroviridae families together accounted for 76.3% of all identified viruses. The species-level rarefaction curve further indicated that the most species diversity was included with the greatest sequencing depth, implying that viruses from other viral families were present in very low abundance.",,"Shah, J.

The aim of this study was to characterize (a) the development of the RNA viral community in the small intestine of healthy broilers from hatch to 6 weeks of age (market age) and (b) the contribution of the source breeder in front of the bird. age in the development of the community structure. Intestinal tissue samples were collected from breeders and their progeny, processed for viral RNA extraction, and sequenced using Illumina Hiseq sequencing technology, resulting in PE reads of 100 bp. The results of this study indicated that the breeding source influenced the RNA viral community only at hatch, but the subsequent environment, ie, the age of the bird, had the most significant effect. The most abundant RNA viral family detected at 2, 4 and 6 weeks of age was Astroviridae, whose abundance decreased with age, while the abundance of Picornaviridae increased with age.",,"Shah, J.

1888,Analysis of host-parasite inconsistency in papillomavirus evolution by significance sampling,"Papillomaviruses (PVs) are a family of viruses that infect various species of mammals and non-mammals that cause cervical cancer in humans. The evolutionary history of PVs associated with a wide range of host species is not well understood. Inconsistencies between the phylogenetic trees of various viral genes, as well as between these genes and host phylogenies, suggest historical viral recombination, as well as violations of strict virus-host cospeciation. However, the extent of recombination events between PVs is uncertain, and there is little evidence to support a theory of PV spread through recent host transfers. We have investigated the inconsistency between PV genes, and thus the possibility of recombination, using Bayesian phylogenetic methods. We found significant evidence of phylogenetic inconsistency among the six PV genes E1, E2, E6, E7, L1, and L2, indicating substantial recombination. Analysis of the E1 and L1 phylogenies suggests ancestral recombination events. We also describe a new method for examining alternative mechanisms of host-parasite association by applying significance sampling to Bayesian divergence time estimation. This new approach is not constrained by a fixed viral tree topology or knowledge of viral divergence times, can include multiple parasite taxa per host, and can distinguish between previous virus divergence before host speciation and transfer. of the virus after speciation. Using this method, we found a prior divergence of PV lineages associated with the ancestral mammalian host resulting in at least 6 PV lineages prior to speciation of this host. These PV lineages have followed earlier divergence and cospeciation paths to eventually associate with extant host species. Only one significant instance of host transfer, transfer of the ancestral L1 gene between a Primate and Hystricognathi host, is supported based on divergence times between human upsilon type 41 and porcupine PVs.",,"Shah, S.

1889,The fecal virome of pigs in a high-density farm,"Pigs are an important source of protein worldwide, but are subject to frequent viral outbreaks and numerous infections capable of infecting humans. Modern agricultural conditions can also increase viral transmission and possible zoonotic spread. We describe here the metagenomic-derived virome in the feces of 24 healthy and 12 diarrheal piglets in a high-density farm. Healthy piglets shed an average of 4.2 different mammalian viruses, reflecting a high level of asymptomatic infections. Pigs with diarrhea shed an average of 5.4 different mammalian viruses. Ninety-nine percent of the viral sequences were related to the RNA virus families Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, and Caliciviridae, while 1% were related to the small DNA virus families Circoviridae and Parvoviridae. Identified porcine RNA viruses, in decreasing order of sequence reads, consisted of kobuviruses, astroviruses, enteroviruses, sapoviruses, sapeloviruses, coronaviruses, bocaviruses, and teschoviruses. Nearly complete genomes of multiple novel species of porcine astroviruses and bocaviruses were generated and phylogenetically analyzed. Multiple small circular DNA genomes encoding replicase proteins plus two highly divergent members of the order Picornavirales were also characterized. The possible origin of these viral genomes from protozoa and nematodes that infect pigs is discussed, based on the closest sequence similarities. In summary, an unbiased survey of viruses in the feces of intensively farmed animals revealed frequent coinfections with a highly diverse set of viruses that provide favorable conditions for viral recombination. Animal viral surveys can easily document the circulation of new and known viruses, facilitating the detection of emerging viruses and the prospective evaluation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potentials. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Shan, T.;Li, L.;Simmonds, P.;Wang, C.;Moeser, A.;Delwart, E.",2011.0,,10.1128/jvi.05217-11,1

1891,Un-recombinant natural enterovirus expressed as a single deubiquitinase of torovirus,"Enteroviruses (EVs) are implicated in a wide range of diseases in humans and animals. In this study, a novel enterovirus (Enterovirus species G [EVG]) (EVG 08/NC_USA/2015) was isolated from a diagnostic sample of a case of neonatal swine diarrhea and identified by metagenomics and whole genome sequencing. The viral genome shares 75.4% nucleotide identity with a prototypic EVG strain (PEV9 UKG/410/73). Surprisingly, a 582 nucleotide insert, flanked by 3Cpro cleavage sites at the 5= and 3= ends, was found in the 2C/3A junction region of the viral genome. This insert encodes a predicted protease with 54-68% amino acid identity to torovirus (ToV) papain-like protease (PLP) (ToV-PLP). Structural homology modeling predicts that this protease adopts a fold and catalytic site characteristic of the minimal PLP catalytic domains. This structure is similar to that of the core catalytic domains of the FMD virus leader protease and coronavirus PLPs, which act as deubiquitinating and deGIlating enzymes (interferon [IFN]-stimulated gene 15 [ISG15] deletion) in the host cell. Substrates Importantly, the recombinant ToV-PLP protein derived from this new enterovirus also showed strong deubiquitination and deISGylation activities and demonstrated the ability to suppress IFN-β expression. Using reverse genetics, we generated a ToV-PLP knockout recombinant virus. Compared to wild-type virus, the ToV-PLP knockout mutant virus showed impaired growth and induced higher expression levels of innate immune genes in infected cells. These results suggest that ToV-PLP functions as an innate immune antagonist; Therefore, enterovirus G can gain fitness through the acquisition of ToV-PLP from a recombination event.",,"Shang, P.;Misra, S.;Hause, B.;Fang, Y.",2017.0,,10.1128/jvi.00450-17,0
1892,Molecular Epidemiological Investigation of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus in Northwest China from 2007 to 2010,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically important swine disease that affects pigs worldwide. Northwest China has a sparse pig population and no complete information on PRRSV infection is currently available. In this study, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics and genetic diversity of PRRSV from this region. 322 field-isolated tissue or serum samples were collected from fetuses of aborted pigs or pigs with respiratory disease from 15 herds, twice over a 2-year period. PRRSV infection was determined and virus strains were classified by GP5 sequencing. We found that 35.9% of the animals were PRRSV positive, and the average prevalence in 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 was 46.5 and 29.3%, respectively. To further investigate the genetic divergence of PRRSV samples collected between 2007 and 2010, 32 strains were isolated for GP5 sequencing and analysis, and phylogenetic trees based on GP5 amino acid sequences were created. All PRRSVs were of the North American genotype and belonged to the highly pathogenic HP-PRRSV subgenotype. Isolates from Xinjiang province formed a closely grouped branch and were closely related to an intermediate evolutionary isolated subgroup. Virus sequences from 2007 to 2008 were compared with those from 2009 to 2010 from the same herd. New mutations were found in isolates after 2009 and focused on nucleotides in the decoy epitope of the GP5 antibody. PRRSV strains in northwest China between 2007 and 2010 were similar to those in other regions of China, with some regional characteristics.

1893,Genesis of H9N2 avian influenza in Bangladesh,"The avian influenza subtype H9N2 is endemic in many bird species in Asia and the Middle East and has contributed to the genesis of H5N1, H7N9 and H10N8, which are potential pandemic threats. The H9N2 viruses that have spread to Bangladesh have acquired multiple gene segments from highly pathogenic (HP) H7N3 viruses that are presumably present in Pakistan and are currently co-circulating with HP H5N1. However, the source and geographic origin of these H9N2 viruses are unclear. We characterized the complete genetic sequences of 37 Bangladeshi H9N2 viruses isolated between 2011 and 2013 and investigated their intersubtypic and intrasubtypic genetic diversities by tracing their genesis relative to other H9N2 viruses isolated from neighboring countries. H9N2 viruses in Bangladesh are homogeneous with several mammalian host-specific markers and are a novel H9N2 sublineage in which the hemagglutinin (HA) gene is derived from an Iranian H9N2 lineage (Middle East-B Iran), neuraminidase (NA ) and basic polymerase 2 (PB2) genes are from Dubai H9N2 (Mideast-C Dubai), and nonstructural protein (NS), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein (MP), acid polymerase (PA) genes and polymerase basic 1 (PB1) are from HP H7N3 originating in Pakistan. Different H9N2 genotypes have been detected in Bangladesh and were replaced in 2006 and 2009 by other rearrangements. Phylogenetic and molecular analyzes suggest that the current genotype is descended from the prototypic lineage H9N2 (G1), which circulated in poultry in China in the late 1990s and reached Bangladesh via the Middle Eastern poultry trade, and that this genotype was later reclassified as H7N3. and the H9N2 lineages from Pakistan and spread throughout India.

1895,Molecular epidemiology and complete genome characterization of the Indian H1N1pdm virus,"Background: Influenza A virus is one of the world's major uncontrolled pathogens, causing a seasonal epidemic and a global pandemic. This was evidenced by the recent emergence and continuing prevalence of the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus of swine origin, which caused the first true pandemic in the last 40 years. In the course of its evolution, the virus has acquired many mutations, and multiple unidentified molecular determinants are likely responsible for the ability of the 2009 H1N1 virus to cause increased severity of disease in humans. The availability of limited genome-wide data makes continuous monitoring of these types of events difficult. Outbreaks with considerable morbidity and mortality have been reported in all parts of the country. Methods/Results: Taking into account a large number of clinical cases of infection, a whole genome-based sequence characterization of the Indian H1N1pdm virus and its phylogenetic analysis with respect to circulating global viruses were carried out to reveal the pattern phylodynamic analysis of H1N1pdm virus in India between 2009 and 2011. Clade VII was noted as an important circulating clade in the phylogenetic analysis. Selection pressure analysis revealed 18 positively selected sites on the major surface proteins of the H1N1pdm virus. Conclusions: This study clearly revealed that clade VII has been identified as a recently circulating clade in India and also globally. Few well-identified markers specific to clade VII underwent positive selection during virus evolution. Continuous monitoring of the H1N1pdm virus is guaranteed to track the evolution of the virus and its subsequent transmission.

A total of 34 microbial gene families were detected in 452 viral GOS scaffolds. Most of the metabolic helper genes found on these scaffolds have never been reported on phage. Host genes detected in viruses were mainly divided between genes encoding different pathways of energy metabolism, such as newly identified electron transport and photosystem genes, or related to translation and post-translation mechanisms. Our findings suggest previously undetected ways in which marine phages adapt to their hosts and enhance their fitness, including translational and posttranslational level control over the host rather than the already known transcriptional level control.

1899,High prevalence and diversity of bovine astroviruses in the faeces of healthy and diarrheal calves in south-west Scotland.,"Astroviruses (AstV) are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses and one of the leading causes of childhood diarrhea worldwide. Diarrhea is a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality in calves; therefore, we investigated whether the presence of AstV is associated with calf diarrhea. We identified diverse AstV lineages from faecal samples from healthy and diarrheal calves and healthy adult cattle in south-west Scotland. AstV was common in calves (present in 74% (85/115) of samples) but uncommon in adult cattle (present in 15% (3/20) of samples). No association was found between the presence of AstV and diarrhea in calves or the presence of a specific lineage of AstV and diarrhea in calves. AstV was strongly associated with the presence of rotavirus group A (RVA), and a protective effect of age was evident for both AstV and RVA. Coinfections with multiple AstV lineages were detected in several calves and serial infection with different viruses could also be observed by longitudinal sampling of individuals. In summary, our study found genotypically diverse AstV in the faeces of calves in south-west Scotland. However, no association between AstV and calf diarrhea was identified, suggesting that the virus does not play a major role in the aetiology of calf diarrhea in the group studied.

1900,Fast-fermenting substance modulates interactions between ruminal commensals and toll-like receptors in promoting immunological tolerance of the goat rumen,"It remains unclear whether non-fiber dietary carbohydrates (NFC), a rapidly fermentable substance, affect rumen immune homeostasis through modulation of ruminal microbiota and epithelial toll-like receptor (TLR) interactions. A combination of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR was applied to study the synergistic responses of the ruminal microbiota and epithelial TLRs to the change in dietary NFC from 15 to 31% in the goat model. The results showed that the 31% NFC diet caused dramatic increases in the richness and diversity of the rumen microbiota. The Verrucomicrobia phylum expanded most significantly, while opportunistic pathogens, namely Rikenella, Anaeroplasma, and Olsenella, significantly decreased. In the rumen epithelium, the significant increase in the expressions of TLR1, 6, 10 was associated with the significant decrease in the expressions of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), IL-6, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. . Restricted correlation analysis indicated that the higher abundance of commensal bacteria in subdivision 5 of Verrucomicrobia contributed to the upregulation of TLR10 expression. Finally, significantly increased concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the rumen, along with significantly increased expressions of epithelial genes related to SCFA uptake, were observed in goats fed a 31% NFC diet. Thus, NFC-induced rumen microbiota expansion promoted epithelial tolerance by enhancing the intensity of TLR10 signaling. The newly established balance benefited the transport of ruminal energy substances to the blood.",,"Shen, H.;Lu, Z.;Chen, Z.;Wu, Y.;Shen, Z.",2016.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2016.01812,0

1903,Isolation and phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin gene from H9N2 influenza viruses from chickens in southern China from 2012 to 2013,"As part of our ongoing influenza surveillance program in southern China, between 2012 and 2013, 19 field strains of the avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H9N2 were isolated from sick or dead chicken flocks in China province. Guangdong, South China. The hemagglutinin (HA) genes of these strains were sequenced and analyzed and phylogenetic analysis showed that 12 of the 19 isolates belonged to the h9.4.2.5 lineage, while the other seven belonged to h9.4.2.6. Specifically, we found that all viruses isolated in 2013 belonged to the h9.4.2.5 lineage. Viruses of lineage h9.4.2.5 contained a PSRSSRâ†""GLF motif at the HA cleavage site, whereas viruses of lineage h9.4.2.6 contained a PARSSRâ†""GLF at the same position. Most of the isolates in the h9.4.2.5 lineage lost a potential glycosylation site at residues 200-202 and had an additional one at residues 295-297 in HA1. Notably, 19 isolates had an amino acid swap (Q226L) at the receptor binding site, indicating that the viruses had potential receptor-binding affinity similar to that of humans.

1904,Genomic and evolutionary characterization of a new type influenza-C virus of pigs,"We recently described the isolation of a novel influenza virus from pigs presenting with respiratory illness in the United States that is distantly related to human influenza C virus. Based on genetic, biochemical, and morphological analysis, the virus was provisionally classified as C/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK). To better understand the genetics and evolution of this new pathogen, we performed a comprehensive analysis of its sequence and phylogeny. The results demonstrated that C/OK and human influenza C viruses share a conserved array of predicted functional domains in the viral RNA genome replication and viral entry machinery, but vary in key functional sites. Furthermore, our evolutionary analysis showed that the homologous genes of the C/OK and human influenza C viruses diverged from each other approximately several hundred to thousands of years ago. Taken together, the findings described in this study support and extend our previous observations that C/OK is a genetically and evolutionarily distinct influenza virus in the family Orthomyxoviridae. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Vienna.",,"Sheng, Z.;Ran, Z.;Wang, D.;Hoppe, A.

1905,A metagenomic study of viral abundance and diversity in mosquitoes from hubei province,"Mosquitoes, as one of the most common but important vectors, have the potential to transmit or acquire a large number of viruses through bites; however, the viral flora of mosquitoes and their impact on the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases has not been well investigated or evaluated. In this study, the metagenomic technique was successfully employed to analyze viral community abundance and diversity in three mosquito samples from Hubei, China. Among the 92,304 reads produced through a run on the 454 GS FLX System, 39% have high similarities to viral sequences belonging to identified bacterial, fungal, animal, plant, and insect viruses, and 0.02% were classified as unidentified viral sequences, demonstrating high abundance and diversity. of viruses in mosquitoes. In addition, two new viruses in the Densovirinae subfamily and the Dicistroviridae family were identified, and six torque tenosus1 viruses in the Anelloviridae family, three porcine parvoviruses in the Parvovirinae subfamily, and one Culex tritaeniorhynchus rhabdovirus in the Rhabdoviridae family were preliminarily characterized. Viral metagenomic analysis gave us a deep insight into the viral population of mosquitoes that played an important role in viral initiative or passive transmission and evolution during the process.",,"Shi, C.;Liu, Y.;Hu, X.;Xiong, J.;Zhang, B.;Yuan, Z.",2015.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0129845,0
1906,Genomic characterization and pathogenicity of a porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus strain isolated in China,"Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a member of the betacoronavirus genus within the coronaviridae family, which invades the central nervous system (CNS) via the peripheral nervous system and causes encephalomyelitis or wasting and vomiting disease (VWD) in lactating piglets. Until now, although few complete nucleotide sequences of PHEV have been reported, they are not annotated. This study aimed to illuminate the characterization of the genome, phylogenesis, and pathogenicity of the PHEV/2008 strain. The total genome length of the PHEV/2008 strain was 30,684 bp, with a G + C content of 37.27%. The genome included a minimum of 11 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by 5-inch and 3-inch untranslated regions (UTRs) of 211 and 289 nucleotides. The replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which had 4382 and 7094 amino acid residues, respectively, were predicted to be cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases. Phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequence revealed that the PHEV/2008 strain was genetically different from other known PHEV types, representing a novel genotype (GI-1). Furthermore, we found that PHEV/2008 was neurotropic and highly pathogenic for 4-week-old BALB/c mice. Taken together, this is the first detailed and annotated complete genome sequence of a new PHEV genotype strain in China.",,"Shi, J.;Zhao, K.;Lu, H.;Li, Z.;Lv, X.;Lan, Y.;Guan, J.;He, W.;Gao, F.",2018.0,,10.1007/s11262-018-1591-y,0
1907,Molecular epidemiology of PRRSV: a phylogenetic perspective,"Since its first discovery two decades ago, the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) has been the subject of intense research due to its enormous impact on the global swine industry. Thanks to phylogenetic analyses, much has been learned about the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of the virus. In this review, we focus on the evolutionary and epidemiological aspects of PRRSV from a phylogenetic perspective. We first describe the diversity and transmission dynamics of PRRSV type 1 and 2, respectively. Next, we focus on the earliest evolutionary history of PRRSV: the time of appearance of all existing PRRSVs and a hypothesis of origin were discussed. Finally, we summarize the results of previous recombination studies to assess the potential impact of recombination on virus epidemiology. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",,"Shi, M.;Lam, T. T. Y.;Hon, C.

1908,Origin and molecular characterization of H6N1 influenza virus infecting humans in Taiwan,"In June 2013, the first H6N1 human influenza virus infection was confirmed in Taiwan. However, the origin and molecular characterization of this virus, A/Taiwan/2/2013 (H6N1), have not been well studied so far. In this report, we perform phylogenetic and coalescent analyzes of this virus and compare its molecular profile/characteristics with other closely related strains. Molecular characterization of H6N1 revealed that it is a typical low pathogenic avian influenza virus, which may not replicate or spread well in the upper respiratory tract of mammals. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus clusters with A/chicken/Taiwan/A2837/2013 (H6N1) in seven genes except PB1. For the PB1 gene, A/Taiwan/2/2013 clustered with a different H6N1 lineage from A/chicken/Taiwan/A2837/2013. Although an earlier study showed that the PB2, PA, and M genes of A/Taiwan/2/2013 could be derived from H5N2 viruses, coalescent analyzes revealed that these H5N2 viruses were derived from strains more recent than the ancestor of A/Taiwan. /2/2013. Therefore, we propose that A/Taiwan/2/2013 is a reassortment of different H6N1 lineages circulating in chickens in Taiwan. Furthermore, compared to avian isolates, a single substitution of P186L (H3 numbering) at hemagglutinin H6 of the human isolate could increase mammalian receptor binding and thus the pathogenicity of this strain in humans. In general, human infection with this virus appears to be an accidental event and is unlikely to cause an influenza pandemic. However, its co-circulation and possible regrouping with other influenza subtypes still deserve attention. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Shi, W.;Shi, Y.;Wu, Y.;Liu, D.;Gao, G.

These H7N9 virus isolates were closely related phylogenetically to those prevalent in China. Antigenic analysis revealed that the hemagglutinin of the H7N9 HPAIV isolate was slightly different from that of H7N9 LPAIV and older H7 strains. These AIV-contaminated meat products repeatedly brought into Japan increase the risks to poultry and public health. Ongoing border disease control based on detection and culling of infected poultry and meat products is therefore essential for preventing the introduction and spread of AIV.",,"Shibata, A.;Okamatsu, M.;Sumiyoshi, R.;Matsuno, K.;Wang, Z.

However, in many cases, most of the detected sequences originate from the host genome and from the bacterial flora of the gut. Here, to improve the efficiency of double-stranded (ds) RNA virus detection from samples, we evaluated the applicability of S1 nuclease in deep sequencing. Treatment of total RNA with S1 nuclease resulted in 1.5- to 28.4-fold and 10.1- to 208.9-fold increases in group A rotavirus sequence readouts in fecal and viral culture samples, respectively. Furthermore, the increased coverage of the reference sequence mapping allowed for sufficient genotyping using analytical software. These results suggest that library construction using the S1 nuclease is useful for deep sequencing in the detection of dsRNA viruses.",,"Shimada, S.;Nagai, M.;Moriyama, H.;Fukuhara, T.;Koyama, S.;Omatsu, T.;Furuya, T.;Shirai, J.;Mizutani, T.",2015.0,,10.1292/jvms.14-0607,0

Sequences of 890 nt of nucleoprotein (N) genes from these isolates were analyzed and compared with those of other previously characterized Brazilian isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three RV genetic lineages coexisting in this region. Each lineage was found to be associated with a particular host species and to circulate independently of one another. The first lineage was found in foxes (Dusicyon sp.) and could be discriminated from domestic carnivore isolates from São Paulo, Goiás and Minas Gerais in southern and central Brazil. The second lineage was associated with insectivorous bats (Molossus spp.) and differed from RV isolates associated with vampire bats. The third lineage was found in cattle and was grouped with RV isolates associated with vampire bats from São Paulo, Tocantins, Goiás and Matto Grosso. These results indicate that RV from these genetic lineages are co-circulating in the state of Paraíba and that cattle in this region are infected with RV associated with the vampire bat, suggesting that the vampire bat is the main reservoir of rabies in cattle. in this region.",,"Shoji, Y.;Kobayashi, Y.;Sato, G.;Gomes, A.

1912,Evidence of interspecies transmission and reassortment of influenza A viruses in pigs in southern China.,"The Asian/57, Hong Kong/68, and Russian/77 pandemics of this century appeared or reappeared in China. Interspecies transmission and genetic reassortment of influenza viruses have been implicated in the origin of these pandemic human influenza viruses. Pigs have been suspected to be the ""mixing vessel"" where the rearrangement occurs. To investigate this possibility, 104 swine influenza viruses randomly collected in southern China between 1976 and 1982, including 32 H3N2 isolates and 72 H1N1 isolates, were studied by dot-blot hybridization, partial sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. There were 29 of 32 H3N2 isolates with characteristics of viruses originally derived from humans; the other 3 isolates were rearrangements containing genes from swine and human influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes of polymerase B1 (PB1) genes showed that interspecies transmission from humans to pigs has occurred several times in pigs in southern China. All 72 H1N1 isolates were of porcine origin characteristic of classical H1N1 swine influenza virus. Analysis of 624 swine influenza virus genes from southern China failed to detect any evidence of avian influenza virus genes. This contrasts with what is currently found in Europe, where the majority of isolated swine influenza viruses are of avian origin.",,"Shu, L. L.;Lin, Y. P.;Wright, S. M.;Shortridge, K. F.;Webster, R.

1913,"Genetic heterogeneity of swine hepatitis E virus isolates from Yunnan province, China in 2011-2012.","Background: Hepatitis E is a disease of great concern for public health, mainly in developing countries. Although molecular and seroepidemiological investigations of HEV have been conducted in many provinces in China, epidemiological data from Yunnan province are limited and genotypes are not fully characterized. In this study, the prevalence and characteristics of hepatitis E virus (HEV) detected in pigs in Yunnan province, China, were evaluated. Results: A total of 13 of 187 pig fecal samples collected in 2011 revealed positive results for HEV; likewise, 7 of 69 samples collected in 2012 presented positive results. These findings indicated a total prevalence of 7.8% (20/256). The results of the phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis revealed that nine strains were found in the samples obtained in 2011, sharing between 87.1% and 99.4% nucleotide sequence identity between these strains; and 77.0% to 81.9%, 52.2% to 53.6%, 77.0% to 88.2%, and 77.9% to 96.8% shared sequence identities of nucleotides with strains representing genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Five strains were detected in samples obtained in 2012, in which the strains shared 94.2% to 99.3% nucleotide sequence identity, and 81.0% to 82.5%, 81.8% to 83.2%, 81.0% to 92.7%, and 81.0% to 97.8% nucleotide sequence identities were they shared with the strains representing genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4. Conclusions: The analysis of fourteen HEV strains detected revealed that three of them were subtype 4d, two were subtype 4b; the remaining nine isolates were of the 4h subtype.

1914,Molecular detection and characterization of West Nile virus associated with multifocal retinitis in patients from South India.,"Background: In late 2009/early 2010, approximately 2,000 people were affected by a mysterious viral outbreak in a southern district of Tamil Nadu; this particularly affected those who lived in coastal areas. Blood samples from affected patients were sent for clinical analysis to determine the actual cause of the disease, but reports were inconclusive. Methods: The present study describes the clinical observations and laboratory investigations involving molecular methods performed in 170 of the 2,000 clinically suspected cases. These were patients who were admitted to Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, Tamil Nadu with ocular complications. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR, and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal gene amplification (RT-LAMP) assays were used to detect West Nile virus infection (WNV). Further investigation of the genetic diversity of WNV implicated in ocular complications was carried out using sequence phylogeny. Results: Of 170 samples, 25 (15%) were positive for chikungunya IgM antibodies, 10 (6%) for chikungunya antigen, and 30 (18%) were positive for dengue IgM antibodies. The remaining 105 seronegative samples were further processed for WNV detection by IgM capture ELISA and molecular methods. Of the 105 samples, 35 (33%) were positive for WNV IgM antibody, 15 (14%) were positive for WNV by RT-PCR, and 27 (26%) were positive for WNV by both time-lapse and time-lapse assays. real and real-time analysis. RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays. Comparative evaluation with serum samples from patients in the acute phase revealed 100% concordance between the real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays. These assays had an overall higher sensitivity than conventional RT-PCR, as they collected an additional 12 samples with low template copy number. Further genotyping through sequence phylogeny revealed that all WNV isolates clustered in lineage I.

The genome consisted of 7225 nucleotides, excluding a poly-A tail at the 3â€² end, and contained three open reading frames (ORFs), ORF-1, ORF-2 and ORF-3, encoding 1702, 660 and 113 amino acids. , respectively. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that SAAS-JDY5 belonged to the 3 HEV genotype and was most closely related to the Japanese isolate wbJYG1 (AB222184).

1916,Evolution of a cytoplasmic tripartite motif (TRIM) protein in cows that restricts retroviral infection,"Primate tripartite motif 5α (TRIM5α) proteins mediate innate intracellular resistance to retroviruses. In humans, TRIM5 is found in a paralogous group that includes TRIM6, TRIM34, and TRIM22. Although the TRIM6 and TRIM34 orthologs are found in other mammals, to date TRIM5 has only been identified in primates. Cow cells exhibit early blocks to infection by various retroviruses. We identified a cytoplasmic TRIM protein encoded by LOC505265 that is responsible for the restriction of infection by various lentiviruses and N-tropic murine leukemia virus in cow cells. The susceptibility of N-tropic murine leukemia virus to 505265-mediated restriction is primarily determined by residue 110 of the viral capsid protein. Phylogenetically, cow LOC505265 segregates with the TRIM5/TRIM6/TRIM34 cluster, but is not an ortholog of the known TRIM genes. The B30.2/SPRY domain of 505265 exhibits long variable regions, a characteristic of proteins encoded by this paralog group, and shows evidence of positive selection. Cows appear to have independently evolved a retroviral restriction factor from the same TRIM family that generated TRIM in primates. The particular characteristics of this subset of cytoplasmic TRIM proteins may lead to the convergent evolution of limiting factors of the virus. © 2006 by the US National Academy of Sciences.",,"Si, Z.;Vandegraaff, N.;O'Huigin, C.;Song, B.;Yuan, W.;Xu, C.;Perron, M.;Li, X.;Marasco, W.

Different isolates were sequenced. of H5N1 to explore the genetic diversity of these viruses. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed close clustering and highest sequence identity in all 8 genes with HPAI H5N1 isolates belonging to the EMA-3 sublineage of unified H5, EMA-3 sublineage recovered from Afghanistan during the same time period. Two subgroups were observed within the Pakistani H5N1 viruses, domestic and wild birds, based on their sequence homology and mutations. HPAI motif, preferred receptor specificity for α-(2, 3) linkages, potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and an additional glycosylation site in the globular head of the HA protein from four Pakistani H5N1 isolates. While amino acids associated with sensitivity to various antiviral drugs (Oseltamivir, Zanamivir, Amantadine) were found to be conserved for H5N1 isolates from Pakistan. Interestingly, some important mutations were observed in critical positions of antigenic sites (S141P, D155S, R162I and P181S) and in the receptor binding pocket (A185T, R189K and S217P) of HA-1. High sequence similarity was also observed between Pakistani HP H5N1 and LP H9N2 viruses. Bird-like host-specific markers were also observed with the exception of E627K in PB2, K356R in PA, V33I in NP, I28V in M2, and L107F in NS2. Conclusions: Several point mutations were observed in different genes of Pakistan H5 virus during its circulation in the field. Outbreaks started in Khyber Pakhtoon Khawa (north-west) province in 2006 and spread to southern regions over a period of time. Although migratory birds may have a role in this continued endemicity of clade 2.2 H5N1 viruses during 2006-2008 in Pakistan, the possibility of their transmission through the legal or illegal poultry trade through the US cannot be ignored. borders. © 2012 Siddique et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Siddique, N.;Naeem, K.;Abbas, M.

Seroconversion against the H4N6 subtype was observed mainly in bird populations from Sindh and Khyber Pakhtoon Khawa provinces. The isolation disclosed the role of LBM where mixing of different bird species provides an excellent environment for the spread and possible reassortment of AIV.

In the presence of 4 M urea and approximately 90% formamide, these particles released linear nucleic acid molecules with the twisted appearance characteristic of single-stranded RNA or single-stranded DNA. They could be distinguished from lambda phage nucleic acid added to the preparation as a marker of double-stranded configuration. Experiments in which the virus particles under investigation were incubated at pH 12.9 at 50 degrees C for 30 minutes revealed that their nucleic acid molecules hydrolyzed as easily as the RNA genome of poliovirus type 2 analyzed in parallel. However, both phiX174 and parvovirus LuIII single-stranded DNA were unaffected by this treatment, and lambda phage double-stranded DNA was denatured to single-stranded molecules.

Specifically, the VP1-VP3 and NSP2-5/6 genes of these viruses are usually classified as genotype 1 with >. 81% nucleotide sequence identity. However, it remains unknown whether the genotype 1 genes and proteins of human Wa-like strains are distinguishable from porcine strains. To investigate this, we performed comprehensive bioinformatic analyzes using all known genotype 1 gene sequences. The analyzed RVAs represent wild-type strains isolated from humans or pigs in various geographic locations during the years 2004-2013, including 11 recently sequenced porcine RVAs from Brazil. We also analyzed archival strains that were isolated during the years 1977-1992, as well as atypical strains involved in cross-species transmission between humans and pigs. We found that, in general, the genotype 1 genes of typical modern human Wa-type RVAs clustered in phylogenetic trees and were separate from those of typical modern porcine RVAs. The only exception was for the NSP5/6 gene, which did not show host-specific phylogenetic clustering. Using amino acid sequence alignments, we identified 34 positions that differentiated genotype 1 proteins VP1-VP3, NSP2, and NSP3 from typical modern human Wa-type RVAs versus typical modern porcine RVAs and documented how these positions vary in the unusual isolates/ archive. No host-specific amino acid positions were identified for NSP4, NSP5, or NSP6. Taken together, the results of this study support the notion that human Wa-type RVAs and porcine RVAs are evolutionarily related, but indicate that some of their genotype 1 genes and proteins have diverged over time, possibly reflecting hijacked replication and coadaptation of proteins. on their respective hosts.",,"Silva, F.

1923,Follow-up of the molecular epidemiology of Brazilian infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) isolates,"Infectious bursal disease is a highly contagious disease of young chickens caused by the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Genome segment A encodes the capsid protein (VP2), while segment B encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (VP1). In the present study, we traced the molecular epidemiology of IBDV in Brazil by analyzing 29 isolates collected in the main poultry production regions. To genetically characterize the isolates, phylogenetic and population dynamic analyzes were performed using 68 VP1 (2634 nt) and 102 VP2 (1356 nt) coding sequences from IBDV isolates from different regions of the world. In addition, the evolution of IBDV was analyzed by characterizing the selective forces that operated during the diversification of viral isolates. We show that IBDV isolates were introduced into Brazil mainly from the Netherlands and the US. These introductions were associated with all Brazilian poultry production regions analyzed in this work. Furthermore, we show that IBDV evolution has been shaped by a combination of very low recombination rates and relatively high rates of nucleotide substitution (2.988 × 10-4 for VP1 and 3.2937 × 10-4 for VP2), which in turn they are a purifying selection function that operates on VP1 and VP2. Furthermore, our extended Bayesian horizon plot suggests that the increase in the effective population size of IBDV isolates is consistent with its epidemiological history, with a large increase during the onset of acute IBD outbreaks in the 1980s. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",,"Silva, F.

1925,Present and Future Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance in Animals: Review of Principles and Practices,"There is broad international consensus that surveillance of levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurring in various systems supports strategies to address the problem. The key reasons for monitoring resistance are to determine (i) the size of the problem, (ii) whether resistance is increasing, (iii) whether previously unknown types of resistance are emerging, (iv) whether a particular type of resistance is emerging. is spreading and (v) whether a particular type of resistance is associated with a particular outbreak. The implications of acquiring and using this information must be considered in the design of a surveillance system. AMR surveillance provides a basis for assessing the burden of AMR and for providing the evidence needed to develop efficient and effective prevention and control strategies. The joint development of human and animal AMR surveillance programs is essential, but several key elements remain that make data comparisons between AMR monitoring programs and between regions difficult. Currently, AMR surveillance is based on simple in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility methods. However, the lack of harmonization between programs and the limitation of AMR genetic information remain the main drawbacks of these phenotypic methods. The future of AMR surveillance is moving towards genotypic detection, and molecular analysis methods are expected to provide a wealth of information. However, the expectation that these molecular techniques will surpass phenotypic susceptibility tests in the diagnosis and routine follow-up of AMR remains a distant reality, and phenotypic tests are still necessary for the detection of emerging resistant bacteria, new mechanisms of AMR strength and trends.",,"Simjee, S.;McDermott, P.;Trott, D.

The virus was identified in hepatocytes from embryonic chickens and parakeets that received injections of liver suspensions from naturally infected psittacines. Infected hepatocytes had prominent intranuclear inclusions containing naked nucleocapsids. Both naked and enveloped virions were observed in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, and enveloped nucleocapsids were occasionally observed in the perinuclear cisternae and extracellularly. The spontaneous, experimental disease mimicked a condition in parrots previously described by Pacheco. The viral agent was classified as Herpesvirus on the basis of the character of the intranuclear inclusions, the size and conformation of the agent as determined by electron microscopy and filtration, and the sensitivity of the agent to ether.",,"Simpson, C.

Six small RNA libraries (RNAs) were multiplexed on an Ion Torrent PI chip and sequenced on the Ion Proton System. The reads obtained were aligned with the genome of Bos taurus (assembly UMD3.1), which is the species phylogenetically closest to the buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). A total of 160 bovine miRNAs in buffalo PBMC were biocomputationally identified and 130 putative new miRNAs (not included in the bovine mirBase) were identified. All of these 290 miRNAs identified in the six treatment and control samples represent the repertoire of novel miRNAs for the buffalo species. The expression profiles of these miRNAs in the samples have been represented by dendrogram plots and sample heat map. Uniquely expressed miRNAs were identified in each treatment and control group. Some miRNAs were expressed at very high levels, while most of them were moderately expressed. bta-miR-103 and -191 miRNAs were found to be highly abundant and expressed in all samples. Other abundantly expressed miRNAs include bta-miR-19b, -29b, -15a, -19a, -30d, -30b-5p, and let family members (let 7a-5p, let 7g, and let 7f) in LPS-treated PBMCS and CpG and bta-miR-191, -103 and -19b in PBMC stimulated with Poly I:C. Only one novel miRNA (bta-miR-11039) of the 130 putatively novel miRNAs identified was expressed in all six samples, and differentially expressed miRNAs (>2-fold) were identified. Six of the miRNAs differentially expressed between groups (bta-miR-421, bta-let-7i, bta-miR-138, bta-miR-21-5p, bta-miR-222, and bta-miR-27b) were subsequently confirmed by TaqMan quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, differentially expressed miRNA target genes were enriched for roles in innate immunity and TLR signaling pathways. This inaugural study on the profiling and cataloging of bubalin miRNAs expressed in TLR ligand-stimulated PBMCs will provide an important benchmark for future studies on the regulatory roles of miRNAs in the buffalo immune system.",,"Singh, J.;Mukhopadhyay, C.

1930,Taxonomic and gene-focused metagenomics of the fecal microbiome of low and high feed conversion ratio (FCR) broilers,"Individual weight gain in broiler farmers appears to vary, which may be due in part to variation in their gut microbiota. In this article we analyze the fecal microbiota of low and high feed conversion ratio (FCR) broilers. After rapid sequencing of the fecal microbiome, we used the SEED database to identify microbial diversity and metabolic potential in high and low FCR birds. The domain-level breakdown of our samples was bacteria (>95%), eukaryotes (>2%), archaea (>0.2%), and viruses (>0.2%). At the phylum level, Proteobacteria (78.83% in low FCR and 52.04% in high FCR), Firmicutes (11.97% in low FCR and 27.53% in high FCR) and Bacteroidetes (7.10% in low FCR and 17.53% in high FCR) prevailed in the group. fecal microbial community. Poultry fecal metagenomes revealed the sequences related to 33 genera in both low and high FCR with significantly different ratios. Functional analysis revealed that genes for carbohydrate, amino acid and derivative metabolism and protein metabolism were more abundant in the SEED subsystem in both samples. Genes associated with stress, virulence, cell wall, and cell capsule were also abundant. Indeed, genes associated with sulfur assimilation, flagellum, and flagellar motility were overrepresented in birds with low FCR.

In recent years, several outbreaks in East Asia have been associated with neurological complications and numerous deaths. An outbreak in Singapore in October 2000 affected thousands of children, resulting in four fatal cases out of three of which EV71 was isolated. The genomes of two representative EV71 strains isolated from a fatal case and a surviving patient were fully sequenced, and their nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared with known EV71 strains. The two strains in the outbreak were classified as genogroup B, along with those previously isolated in Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan. Comparative sequence analysis of the two Singaporean strains revealed 99% nucleotide similarity, while their deduced amino acid sequences were nearly identical except for residue 1506 in the 3A nonstructural region. Since the outbreak involved closely related genetic variants of EV71, the broad spectrum of disease severity can be attributed to critical factors, such as different viral inoculation doses or different host immune responses after infection, but is less likely to be due to to the appearance of EV71. more virulent strains.",,"Singh, S.;Poh, C.

Here we use viral metagenomics to characterize the eukaryotic virome in the feces of healthy children from a large urban center and from three Amerindian villages with minimal outside contact. Numerous human enteric viruses, mainly from the families Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae, were sequenced from each of the sites. Multiple children from the same villages shed closely related viruses reflecting frequent transmission clusters. The feces of the isolated villagers also contained multiple viral genomes of unknown cellular origin from the order Picornavirales and the CRESS-DNA group and higher levels of DNA from nematodes and protozoa. Despite cultural and geographic isolation, the diversity of enteric human viruses was not reduced in these Amazonian peoples.

1933,"ENDEMIC INFECTION OF SEVERAL SOUTHERN SEA OTTERS (ENHYDRA LUTRIS NEREIS) WITH NOVEL PARVOVIRUSES, POLYOMAVIRUSES AND ADENOVIRUSES","Over the past century, the southern sea otter (SSO; Enhydra lutris nereis) population has been slowly recovering from near extinction due to overexploitation. The SSO is a threatened subspecies under federal law and a fully protected species under California law, USA. Through a collaborative multi-agency program, stranded animals are rehabilitated and released, while deceased animals undergo autopsies and tissues are cryopreserved to facilitate scientific study. Here, we process archival tissues to enrich for particle-associated viral nucleic acids, which we randomly amplify and deeply sequence to identify viral genomes through sequence similarities. Anelloviruses and endogenous retroviral sequences constituted more than 50% of the viral sequences observed. Polyomavirus, parvovirus, and adenovirus sequences made up the majority of the remaining reads. We characterized and phylogenetically analyzed the complete genome of sea otter polyomavirus 1 and the complete coding sequence of sea otter parvovirus 1 and found that the closest known viruses infect primates and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), respectively. We tested archived tissues from 69 stranded SSO necropsied over 14 years (2000-13) by PCR. Polyomavirus, parvovirus, and adenovirus infections were detected in 51, 61, and 29% of animals examined, respectively, with no significant increase in frequency over time, suggesting endemic infection. We found that 80% of SSOs tested were infected with at least one of three DNA viruses, whose tissue distribution we determined in 261 tissue samples. Parvovirus DNA was most frequently detected in mesenteric lymph nodes, polyomavirus DNA in spleen, and adenovirus DNA in multiple tissues (spleen, retropharyngeal and mesenteric lymph nodes, lung, and liver). This study describes the virome in the tissues of a threatened species and shows that stranded SSOs are frequently infected with multiple viruses, warranting future research to investigate associations between these infections and the observed lesions.",,"Siqueira, J.

Most of the wild duck-derived viruses and the two turkey-derived viruses had rates of 0.0, indicating that they are not pathogenic. Six of the duck-derived viruses had indices ranging from 0.25 to 0.49, and the PIVI for A/chicken/Alabama/75 (H4N8) was 0.49, indicating low pathogenic potential. An IVPI of 1.25 up to the maximum score of 3.0 is necessary for an influenza A virus to be classified as highly pathogenic. Gross lesions seen in chickens that died after intravenous viral challenge included renal swelling with more prominent lobular patterns, but no visceral urate deposits.

Numerous serotypes of viruses classified as caliciviruses were isolated from a variety of marine mammals.

We have re-examined published sequences and found that synonymous substitutions were saturated in comparisons between and within virus genotypes. Analysis of full genomic sequences or concatenated ORF1/ORF2 amino acid sequences indicated that HEV variants most closely related to those that infect humans can be systematically divided into six genotypes (types 1 to 4 and two additional genotypes). wild boar). Variants isolated from rabbits, closely related to genotype 3, occupy an intermediate position. Consistent criteria for assigning virus subtypes could not be defined. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of these viruses with the most divergent variants from chickens, bats, and rodents at three conserved subgenomic regions (residues 1 to 452 or 974 to 1534 of ORF1 or residues 105 to 458 of ORF2) provided consistent support for a division into 4 groups, corresponding to HEV variants that infect humans and pigs, those that infect rats and ferrets, those of bats, and those of chickens. This approach may form the basis for a future genetic classification of HEV into four species, with the most divergent HEV-like virus from fish (cutthroat trout virus) representing a second genus. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Smith, D.

Genetically, both viruses are heterogeneous and are classified into several genotypes that differ in their geographic distribution and association of risk groups. However, there is little evidence that HAV or HEV variants differ antigenically or in their propensity to cause severe disease. Genetically more divergent but mainly hepatotropic variants of HAV and HEV have been found in several mammalian species, those of HAV are classified into eight species within the genus Hepatovirus in the virus family Picornaviridae. HEV is classified as a member of the Orthohepevirus A species in the Hepeviridae family of viruses, a species that also contains viruses that infect pigs, rabbits, and a variety of other mammalian species.

A subset of these viruses infects humans and can cause self-limited acute hepatitis that can become chronic in immunocompromised individuals. Currently published descriptions of the taxonomic divisions within the family Hepeviridae are contradictory regarding the assignment of species and genotypes. Through analysis of existing sequence information, we propose a taxonomic scheme in which the family is divided into the genera Orthohepevirus (all mammalian and avian hepatitis E virus (HEV) isolates) and Piscihepevirus (hepatitis E virus). cutthroat trout). Species within the genus Orthohepevirus are named Orthohepevirus A (isolates from humans, pigs, wild boars, deer, mongooses, rabbits, and camels), Orthohepevirus B (isolates from chicken), Orthohepevirus C (isolates from rats, bandicoots, Asian muskrat, ferret and mink) and Orthohepevirus D (bat isolates). Proposals for genotype designation within the human and rat HEVs are also made. This hierarchical system is consistent with the phylogeny of hepeviruses, and the three levels of classification (genus, species, and genotype) are consistent and reflect discontinuities in the ranges of pairwise distances between amino acid sequences. The adoption of this system would include the avoidance of host names in taxonomic identifiers and would provide a logical framework for the assignment of new variants.",,"Smith, D.

1940,Dating of the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses,"Pandemic influenza viruses cause significant mortality in humans. In the 20th century, 3 influenza viruses caused major pandemics: the 1918 H1N1 virus, the 1957 H2N2 virus, and the 1968 H3N2 virus. These pandemics were initiated by the successful introduction and adaptation of a new hemagglutinin subtype to humans from an animal source, resulting in antigenic shift. Despite global concern about a new pandemic influenza, the pathway of emergence of pandemic strains remains unknown. Here we estimate the evolutionary history and inferred date of introduction to humans of each of the genes for all 20th century pandemic influenza strains. Our results indicate that the genetic components of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus were circulating in mammalian hosts, ie pigs and humans, as early as 1911 and were not likely to be a recently introduced avian virus. Phylogenetic relationships suggest that A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (BM/1918) virus was generated by reassortment between mammalian viruses and a previously circulating human strain, either in pigs or, possibly, in humans. Furthermore, the seasonal and classical swine H1N1 viruses were not directly derived from BM/1918, but their precursors co-circulated during the pandemic. Mean estimates of the time of most recent common ancestor also suggest that the H2N2 and H3N2 pandemic strains may have been generated through reassortment events in unknown mammalian hosts and involved multiple avian viruses that preceded pandemic recognition. The possible generation of pandemic strains through a series of reassortment events in mammals over a period of years prior to pandemic recognition suggests that appropriate surveillance strategies for detection of precursor viruses may abort future pandemics.",,"Smith, G.

1948,Molecular characterization of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of H9N2 avian influenza viruses isolated from commercial broilers in Iran,"total of 512 tissue samples collected from 30 farms located in various states of Iran during 2008-2009 as part of a program to monitor AIV infection in the poultry population of Iran. Avian influenza virus was isolated from poultry farms with a history of respiratory disease and increased mortality. Nucleotide sequence analysis of five representative isolates confirmed that all isolates possessed one type of amino acid motif (RSSR/GL) at the HA cleavage site. Deduced amino acid sequences showed the presence of L226 (234 in H9 numbering) in all five Iranian isolates indicating a preference for sialic acid receptor binding (2-6). The surface glycoprotein genes of the viruses were >90% similar to those of the A/Quail/Hong Kong/Gl/97 (H9N2) lineage. The neuraminidase stem regions in these viruses were undeleted compared to the A/Dk/HK/Y280/97 lineage (Ck/Bei-like viruses) and the 2 human isolates A/HK/1073/99, A/HK /1074 /99.

1949,Molecular epidemiology of pseudorabies virus in Yunnan and sequence analysis of its gD gene,"Pseudorabies (PR) outbreaks have occurred in Yunnan, China, causing significant economic losses. To determine the prevalence and origin of PR in Yunnan, especially among vaccinated pigs, a total of 791 blood, tissue, semen and serum samples were analyzed by serological methods, PCR and gD gene sequence analysis. Detection with gI viral antibody or PCR showed that the annual PR virus (PRV) positive rates in Yunnan from 2010 to 2014 were 48.15, 21.26, 2.17, 5.22, and 0.35%, respectively, with an average of 15.43%. In general, the incidence decreased during the period 2010-2014, probably due to the application of PRV eradication strategies. A phylogenetic tree based on the complete gD gene sequence was constructed, with all strains grouped into two independent clades, ie, Asian and European-American. Virus isolates from Henan, Tianjin, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Shandong, Fujian, Xinjiang, Hubei, Guangdong, and Yunnan fell into the Asian group, which harbored the South Korean isolate. Four virus isolates from Yunnan, along with Namyangju from South Korea, fell into the European-American clade. It showed that PR was a pandemic as there was no clear clue as to the geographic origin of PRV isolates in China since 2010.",,"Song, C.;Gao, L.;Bai, W.;Zha, X.;Yin, G.;Shu, X.",2017.0,,10.1007/s11262-017-1429-z,0
1950,Detection and Classification of Infectious Bronchitis Viruses Isolated in Korea by Monoclonal Antibody Western Blot Assay,"An immunoblot assay (DIA) with five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was used to detect and classify viruses propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. Using a group-specific MAb 3F5, DIA successfully detected 10 reference strains and 12 Korean isolates of IBV, and the lowest virus titer of IBV detected by DIA was approximately less than 103.8 mean embryonic infective dose/ml. To evaluate the diagnostic efficiency, DIA was compared with the conventional infectious bronchitis (IB) diagnostic method. IBV antigens in allantoic fluid of embryonated eggs inoculated with suspected IB field samples were specifically detected by DIA in only one or two egg passages, whereas the conventional embryonated egg inoculation method required four to seven passages of IBV. eggs to confirm IBV infection. These results indicated that DIA could significantly reduce the time and cost for IB diagnosis. To examine the possibility of classifying IBV by DIA, four strain-specific MAbs, 3A4, 2A3, 6F7 and 2C6, were used. According to the reaction patterns of MAb to IBV antigens, the 10 IBV reference strains were classified into six groups; seven strains belonged to three different groups, and the other three strains each belonged to an individual group. In the case of 12 Korean IBV isolates, they were classified into six groups. Among the six groups, the MAb reaction patterns of three groups matched those of the IBV reference strains, but the others did not. These data suggest that there are at least three variant serotypes of IBV in Korea.",,"Song, C. S.;Kim, J. H.;Lee, Y. J.;Kim, S. J.;Izumiya, Y.;Tohya, Y.;Jang, H. K.;Mikami, T.",1998.0,,,0

Each Korean isolate was isolated from different types of commercial chicken flocks between 1986 and 1997. RFLP patterns of an amplified DNA fragment (1722 bp) containing the IBV S1 gene digested by the restriction enzyme HaeIII showed that all 40 Korean isolates were classified into five genotypes, I to V. Six of them belonged to genotype I which had the same HaeIII and XcmI cleavage patterns with the Massachusetts type (H120 and M41), but the other four genotypes had HaeIII cleavage pattern different from the four reference IBV strains used in this study. . Genotype III seemed to be the main type, as 29 out of 40 isolates belonged to this type which was found consistently in chicken flocks since 1990. On the other hand, genotypes II, IV and V were found in the field only in 1986, 1995. and 1995, respectively. Five selected isolates from each of the five genotypes were inoculated into 1-day-old specific pathogen-free chicks to assess their pathogenicity. Genotype III induced 50% mortality as well as severe renal urate deposition in the kidneys, but the other four genotypes only showed respiratory distress 1 to 2 days after inoculation. The live H120 vaccine protected chicks against exposure to select genotype I isolates, but not genotypes IV to V.

1952,Profiling of Novel MicroRNAs Evoked by EV71 and CA16 Infection in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells by High-throughput Sequencing,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) are two major etiologic agents associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide. Although both belong to the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family, there are many differences in the infection process of these viruses. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Multiple studies indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) may play critical roles in host-pathogen interaction. Our previous study reported that EV71 and CA16 infection leads to differential miRNA expression in human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE). Herein, we aimed to further explore the expression profile and possible functions of other miRNAs differentially expressed in 16HBE cells after EV71 and CA16 infections by high-throughput sequencing. We describe 44 novel miRNAs differentially expressed in all samples. Among these miRNAs, 7 novel, differentially expressed miRNAs show an opposite expression trend during progression of EV71 and CA16 infections. Subsequently, bioinformatic analyses, including the Gene Oncology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases, were used to identify the biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, and pathways involved. The 10 most significant GO and Pathway annotations indicated that 849 target genes are involved in cell development, such as the development of the nervous system, the development of multicellular organisms, and developmental biology. Finally, the genes identified in the GO and Pathway analysis were used to build a co-expression network to further identify the potential function of these co-expressed genes. Therefore, our data may be beneficial in guiding further studies on the molecular mechanism of developmental regulation in the pathogenesis of HFMD caused by EV71 and CA16. Furthermore, it provided new candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets for HFMD.",,"Song, J.;Hu, Y.;Jiang, X.;Zhu, W.;Wu, Z.;Dong, S.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2018.02.008,0
1953,miR-1303 regulates BBB permeability and promotes CNS injury after CA16 infections by directly targeting MMP9,"Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) is a member of the Picornaviridae family and causes mild, self-limited hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in infants and young children. CA16 infection can also progress to central nervous system (CNS) complications; however, the underlying mechanism by which CA16 penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and then causes CNS damage remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of neurotropic CA16 tropism by establishing an in vitro BBB model with CA16 infection and an in vivo model of infant rhesus monkey CA16 infection. The results showed that CA16 infection induced increased BBB permeability accompanied by an upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression. Subsequently, high-throughput miRNA sequencing technology and bioinformatic analysis revealed that miR-1303 can regulate BBB permeability by targeting MMP9. Next, we used dual luciferase, qRT-PCR, and western blot assays to provide evidence for the targeting of MMP9 by miR-1303. Further experiments revealed that CA16 infection promoted the degradation of junctional complexes (Claudin4, Claudin5, VE-Cadherin, and ZO-1), likely through downregulation of miR-1303 and upregulation of MMP9. Finally, EGFP-CA16 infection could enter the CNS by facilitating the degradation of junctional complexes, ultimately causing neuroinflammation and CNS injury, which was confirmed using the in vivo rhesus monkey model. Our results indicate that CA16 might penetrate the BBB and then enter the CNS via downregulation of miR-1303, which disrupts the binding complexes via direct regulation of MMP9, ultimately leading to pathological changes in the CNS. These results provide new therapeutic targets in HFMD patients after CA16 infection.",,"Song, J.;Hu, Y.;Li, H.;Huang, X.;Zheng, H.;Hu, Y.;Wang, J.;Jiang, X.;Li, J.;Yang, Z.;Fan, H.;Guo, L.;Shi, H.;He, Z.;Yang, F.;Wang, X.;Dong, S.;Li, Q.;Liu, L.",2018.0,,10.1038/s41426-018-0157-3,0
1954,Different microRNA profiles reveal the diverse outcomes induced by EV71 and CA16 infection in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by high-throughput sequencing,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) remain the predominant pathogens in hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), but factors underlying the pathogenesis of EV71 and CA16 infections have not been elucidated. . Recently, the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pathogen-host interactions have been highlighted. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive miRNA profile in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) infected with EV71 and CA16 at multiple time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 135 known miRNAs exhibited striking differences in expression. Of these, 30 differentially expressed miRNAs exhibited opposite trends in EV71- and CA16-infected samples. Subsequently, we primarily focused on the 30 key differentially expressed miRNAs through further exploration to predict targets. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis of predicted targets showed enrichment of 14 biological processes, 9 molecular functions, 8 cellular components, and 85 pathways. The regulatory networks of these miRNAs with predicted targets, GOs, pathways, and co-expression genes were determined, suggesting that miRNAs display complex regulatory mechanisms during the infection phase. Accordingly, we specifically analyzed the hierarchical GO categories of predicted targets involved in biological adhesion. The results indicated that the distinct changes induced by EV71 and CA16 infection may be partially related to the function of the blood-brain barrier. Taken together, this is the first report describing miRNA expression profiles in HUVEC with EV71 and CA16 infections by high-throughput sequencing. Our data provide useful information that may help elucidate the different host-pathogen interactions after EV71 and CA16 infection and offer new therapeutic targets for these infections.",,"Song, J.;Hu, Y.;Li, J.;Zheng, H.;Wang, J.;Guo, L.;Ning, R.;Li, H.;Yang, Z.;Fan, H.;Liu, L.",2017.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0177657,0

Methods: Herein, we used deep microRNA (miRNA) sequencing to investigate the functions of novel miRNAs differentially expressed in EV71- and CA16-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results: The results identified 13 novel miRNAs differentially expressed in each group. Furthermore, target genes were predicted by miRanda and RNAhybrid programs, and a total of 2501 targets were found in the two databases. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyzes revealed that these targets were primarily involved in cell development and were associated with nervous system development, system development, development of multicellular organisms, the Wnt signaling pathway, the PDGF signaling pathway, and the EGF receptor signaling pathway. Finally, a co-expression regulatory network with the key targets was constructed to further extrapolate the functional interactions of the targets and their co-expressed genes. Conclusion: Our results not only revealed potential biomarkers or targets for diagnosis and treatment of HFMD, but also provided new insights to explore the mechanisms of EV71 and CA16 pathogenesis.",,"Song, J.;Jiang, X.;Hu, Y.;Li, H.;Zhang, X.;Xu, J.;Li, W.;Zheng, X.;Dong, S.",2018.0,,10.1159/000493798,0
1956,Evidence of Human-to-Swine Transmission of Pandemic Influenza (H1N1) 2009 Virus in South Korea,"As the 2009 pandemic influenza (H1N1) virus continues to infect human populations around the world, reports of epidemiologically related animal infections are also increasing. Since December 2009, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses have been isolated from pigs from different pig farms in South Korea. Genetic and phylogenetic analyzes of the viral segments demonstrated several transmission events from humans to pigs without apparent signs of reassortment. These events were also supported by serological surveillance in sera from pigs collected from April to December, suggesting that reverse transmission likely began between June and July with a dramatic increase in prevalence in the following months. Although molecular characterization indicates that porcine isolates are generally stable, some viruses are genetically evolving, especially in their surface proteins. Animal studies (ferrets and mice) reveal that pig pandemic isolates embody biological properties attributed to currently circulating human pandemic viruses, including replication kinetics and efficient transmission, indicating their potential to re-circulate between the humans. Overall, these results indicate widespread human-to-animal transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza viruses in South Korea. Given the important role of pigs in the ecology of influenza viruses, these transmission events should be closely monitored and minimized to avoid the risk of generating viruses of major human health concern.

1957,Iridescent Chilo virus encodes a putative helicase belonging to a distinct family within the 'DEAD/H' superfamily: Implications for the evolution of large DNA viruses,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the EcoRI DNA fragment M (7099 bp; 0.310-0.345 map units) of the genome of insect iridescent virus type 6-Chilo iridescent virus (CIV) was determined. An open reading frame of 606 codons located in this region encoded a protein (p69) related to a distinct family of putative DNA and/or RNA helicases belonging to the 'DEAD/H' superfamily. Unique sequence signatures that allowed the selective recovery of putative helicases from the new family were derived from amino acid sequence databases. The family includes proteins from yeast, Drosophila, mammals, and bacteria involved in the regulation of transcription and the repair of damaged DNA. It is hypothesized that CIV p69 may be a DNA or RNA helicase possibly involved in viral transcription. It was noted that there is a distant relationship between this family of helicases and another group of proteins consisting of putative helicases from poxviruses, African swine fever virus, and yeast mitochondrial plasmids. CIV p69 is shown to be much more closely related to cellular helicases than to any of the other known viral helicases.

1958,Deep small RNA sequencing identifies viral microRNAs during malignant catarrhal fever induced by herpesvirus alcelaphin 1,"Alcelaphin herpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1) is a γ-herpesvirus (γ-HV) that is transmitted asymptomatically by wildebeest. Following interspecies transmission, AlHV-1 induces a fatal lymphoproliferative disease called malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) in many ruminants, including cattle, and the rabbit model. Latency has been shown to be essential for MCF induction. However, the mechanisms that cause the activation and proliferation of infected CD8+ T cells are unknown. Many γ-HVs express microRNAs (miRNAs). These small non-coding RNAs may regulate the expression of viral or host target genes involved in several pathways and are believed to facilitate viral infection and/or mediate the activation and proliferation of infected lymphocytes. The AlHV-1 genome has been predicted to encode a large number of miRNAs. However, its precise contribution to viral infection and pathogenesis in vivo is unknown. Here, using small RNA cloning and sequencing, we identified 36 potential miRNAs expressed in a lymphoblastoid cell line propagated from a calf infected with AlHV-1 and developing FCM. Among the candidate miRNAs sequenced, 32 were expressed on the reverse strand of the genome in two main groups. The expression of these 32 viral miRNAs was further validated by Northern blotting and quantitative reverse transcription PCR in lymphoid organs from calves or rabbits developing from FCM. To determine the concerted contribution in MCF of 28 viral miRNAs clustered in the non-protein coding region of the AlHV-1 genome, a recombinant virus was produced. The absence of these 28 miRNAs did not affect viral growth in vitro or MCF induction in rabbits, indicating that AlHV-1 miRNAs clustered in this genomic non-protein-coding region are dispensable for MCF induction.",,"Sorel, O.;Tuddenham, L.;Myster, F.;Palmeira, L.;Kerkhofs, P.;Pfeffer, S.;Vanderplasschen, A.;Dewals, B.

1962,Characterization of Low Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza Viruses from North America,"Surveillance of wild birds in North America for avian influenza (AI) viruses with the goal of early identification of the highly pathogenic Asian H5N1 AI virus has identified at least six low pathogenic AI H5N1 viruses between 2004 and 2006. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the 6 H5N1 viruses and 38 H5 subtypes from North American wild birds and an additional 28 N1 subtypes were sequenced and compared with sequences available in GenBank by phylogenetic analysis. Both HA and NA were phylogenetically distinct from viruses outside of North America and from viruses recovered from mammals. Four of the AI H5N1 viruses were characterized as low pathogenic by standard in vivo pathotyping tests. One of the H5N1 viruses, A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06, was shown to replicate to low titers in chickens, turkeys, and ducks. However, transmission of A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06 was more efficient between ducks than between chickens or turkeys depending on virus shedding. The 50% infectious dose in chickens was also determined for A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06 and three other H5 viruses of wild waterfowl origin and was between 105.3 and 107.5 50% infectious doses. in eggs. Finally, the antigenic relatedness of seven H5 viruses representing different phylogenetic clades was assessed by hemagglutination inhibition assay, showing that antigenic relatedness was largely associated with geographic origin. Overall, the data support the conclusion that H5 avian influenza viruses of North American wild bird origin are low pathogenic viruses adapted to wild birds and are antigenically and genetically distinct from the highly pathogenic Asian H5N1 virus lineage.

1963,"Prevalence and phylogenetic analysis of hepatitis E virus in pigs, wild boar, roe deer, deer and elk in Lithuania.","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the main causes of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. In Europe, foodborne zoonotic transmission of HEV genotype 3 has been associated with domestic pigs and wild boar. There are controversial data available on the circulation of the virus in animals used for human consumption and, to date, a gold standard for the diagnosis of HEV-associated hepatitis has not yet been defined. To investigate the current status of HEV infection in Lithuanian pigs and wild ungulates, randomly selected samples were analyzed for the presence of viral RNA by nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) and subsequently genotyped viral RNA. RESULTS: Overall, 32.98 and 22.55% of domestic pig samples were positive for HEV by RT-nPCR targeting ORF1 and ORF2 fragments, respectively. Among ungulates, 25.94% of wild boar samples, 22.58% of roe deer samples, 6.67% of deer samples, and 7.69% of elk samples tested positive for HEV RNA using primers targeting the ORF1 fragment. Using primers targeting the ORF2 fragment of the HEV genome, viral RNA was only detected in 17.03% of wild boar samples and 12.90% of roe deer samples. Phylogenetic analysis based on a 348 nucleotide long region of HEV ORF2 showed that all obtained sequences detected in Lithuanian domestic pigs and wild animals belonged to genotype 3. In this study, sequences identified in pigs, wild boars and roe deer were grouped within from GenBank database 3i subtype reference sequences. Sequences obtained from pig farms located in two different counties in Lithuania were of HEV 3f subtype. The wild boar sequences clustered within the 3i and 3h subtypes, clearly indicating that wild boar may harbor additional HEV subtypes. For the first time, ORF2 nucleotide sequences obtained from roe deer demonstrated that HEV subtype 3i can be found in a novel host. CONCLUSION: The results of viral prevalence and phylogenetic analyzes clearly demonstrated viral infection in Lithuanian pigs and wild ungulates, highlighting a significant concern for zoonotic virus transmission through the food chain and direct contact with animals. The unexpected diversity of the HEV genotype 3 subtype in Lithuania and neighboring countries revealed that further studies are needed to understand the mode of transmission of HEV between animals and humans in the Baltic States region.",,"Spancerniene, U.;Grigas, J.;Buitkuviene, J.;Zymantiene, J.;Juozaitiene, V.;Stankeviciute, M.;Razukevicius, D.;Zienius, D.;Stankevicius, A.",2018.0,,10.1186/s13028-018-0367-7,0

To gain a better understanding of the genes involved in attenuation and to associate the observed changes in phenotype with specific genetic variations, the genomic DNA sequence of a single virulent strain of GaHV-2 (648A) was determined at defined passage intervals. Biological characterization of these ""gap isolates"" in chickens previously indicated that the ability to induce transient paralysis was lost by passage 40 and the ability to induce persistent neurological disease was lost after passage 80, coinciding with the loss of cell formation. neoplastic lesions. Deep sequencing of interval isolates allowed detailed cataloging of the mutations that exist within a single passage population and the frequency with which a given mutation occurs across passages. Macroscopic genetic alterations were identified in new and well-characterized genes and in cis-acting regions involved in replication and cleavage/packaging. Between passages 61 and 101, deletions appeared in genes encoding the virulence factors vLipase, vIL8 and RLORF4, as well as a deletion in the ICP4 promoter. Three virus-encoded telomerase mutations that predominated in late passages were also identified. In general, the frequency of mutations fluctuated greatly during serial passages, and few genetic changes were absolute. This indicates that serial passage of GaHV-2 results in the generation of a library of genomes with limited sequence heterogeneity.",,"Spatz, S. J.;Volkening, J. D.;Gimeno, I.

1967,Serological and virological studies of selected cattle with antibodies against bovine herpesviruses,"In order to investigate the specificity of low titer antibodies against BHV 1, twelve cattle were subjected to stress and treatment with dexamethasone. They were monitored virologically by inoculating cell cultures with nasopharyngeal, ocular, and vaginal or preputial swabs, and serologically by evaluating the prevalence and incidence of antibodies against bovine, caprine, porcine, and equine herpesviruses and against bovine leukemia virus. Antibodies were classified as specific for BHV 1 if the animals excreted IBR virus, or if the antibodies neutralized BHV 1 and reacted with BHV 1 antigens, or additionally reacted with CapHV antigens. Animals whose sera recognized BHV 1 and BHV 2 but no other herpesviruses were considered to have experienced both infections. Nine of the twelve animals had specific antibodies against BHV 1. With three animals, the question of the specificity of their antibodies remains open. Two animals experienced multiple herpesvirus infections. Therefore, the induction of cross-reactive antibodies directed against epitopes common to herpesviruses cannot be ruled out. Sera from one animal reacted with BHV 1 and BHV 4 antigens in ELISA tests. However, they did not neutralize BHV 1.",,"Spirig, C.;Ackermann, M.;MÃ¼ller, H. K.;Bruckner, L.;Kihm, U.",1989.0,,,0

It is a pathogen with worldwide distribution, causing significant economic losses in livestock production. The disease primarily affects sheep and goats, but several other ruminants and mammals have also been reported to be infected. It is also a zoonotic disease, primarily affecting people who come into direct or indirect contact with infected animals (eg, farmers, veterinarians). The disease is usually benign and self-limited, although in many cases, especially in young animals, it can be persistent and even fatal.

1969,Characterization of infectious bursal disease viruses in four-layer flocks in the United States,"Twenty bursa samples were obtained from four flocks of layers vaccinated with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) that experienced problems with immune suppression thought to be infectious bursal disease. All samples were found to be positive for IBDV by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the samples identified them as classic molecular group 3 and group 4 viruses. Two samples from each of four flocks were sequenced, and within one flock, these sequences were identical; however, between flocks some differences were observed. One virus from each of the four flocks was selected for further analysis. The VP2 hypervariable sequence region of samples GA-1, H-30, and CS-2-35 had nucleotide and amino acid similarities to classical vaccines D78 and Vi Bursa G that were used in those flocks. The sequence of HPR-2 was similar to the Bursa Vac 4 vaccine used in that flock and the classic virulent STC strain of IBDV. The deduced amino acid sequence of these isolates revealed that all isolates had proline at position 222, which is characteristic of classical US viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates based on the hypervariable amino acid sequence of VP2 grouped GA-1, H-30, and CS-2-35 with the D78 vaccine and HPR-2 with CTS. The pathogenicity of these isolates was tested in specific pathogen free chickens. Bursa-to-body weight (B-BW) ratios and histopathologic bursal lesion scores were determined. Macroscopic bursa lesions were observed, and the B-BW ratios of birds infected with the four wild-type viruses were significantly different compared to the D78 vaccine and uninoculated control groups. Histopathology of the bursa from the groups infected with GA-1, H-30, CS-2-35 and HPR-2 showed different degrees of follicular depletion and necrosis. Very slight lymphoid depletion was observed in the D78-infected group at 5 days post-inoculation, and no microscopic lesions were observed in this group at 8 days post-inoculation or at any time in the uninoculated control group. . Bursa collected from field virus and D78-infected birds at necropsy revealed the presence of IBDV via RT-PCR, and the VP-2 hypervariable nucleotide sequences of GA-1, H-30, CS-2-35 , HPR-2, and D78 samples were identical to the original viral isolates and the vaccine, respectively.",,"Sreedevi, B.;LeFever, L.

The mortality rate for JE is 30%, while 10-15% of patients fully recover. The disease is spread through the bites of infected mosquitoes that breed in rice fields and feed on pigs, birds and ducks. PURPOSE: Since proteins show an important relationship between structure and function, the study was designed to carry out the identification of poly and non-structural proteins in the group of infectious viruses using different strains of Japanese encephalitis virus, it is say, JAOARS982, Nakayama Strain SA (V), Strain SA -14. METHODS: With reference to nonstructural proteins, we obtained protein sequences from the following groups of Japanese encephalitis viruses: Japanese encephalitis virus, Weatnile virus, Kunjin virus. Further comparative and phylogenetic analysis was performed to explore the evolutionary relationship between these groups. RESULTS: Alignment score phylogeny results were found to be 375184 using multiple alignment, Jal view, ClustalW(1.83), and ClustalW2. However, analysis between nonstructural proteins of Japanese encephalitis virus, Westnile virus, and Kunjin virus revealed that the phylogeny alignment score was 875 via multiple sequence alignment and tree view, respectively. . CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these four strains are interrelated and show high similarity to the other viruses in this group due to conserved regions between their sequences.",,"Srivastava, P.;Trivedi, A.

1971,Animal models of Ebolavirus infection,"Ebola virus is a highly pathogenic member of the Filoviridae family that causes severe hemorrhagic disease in humans and HPNs. The West African outbreak of 2013-2016 has increased interest in developing and refining animal models of Ebola virus disease. These models are used to test countermeasures and vaccines, gain scientific insights into the mechanisms of disease progression and transmission, and study key correlates of immunology. The Ebola virus is classified as a BSL4 pathogen and a Category A agent, for which the US government requires bioterrorism preparedness. Rodents, such as the Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), mice (Mus musculus), and guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), are the most common research species. However, NHPs, especially macaques, are preferred for Ebola virus disease research due to similarities to humans in pathogenesis, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and causes of death. . To satisfy regulatory requirements for the approval of countermeasures against high-impact pathogens, the FDA instituted the Animal Rule, which allows efficacy studies in animal models in lieu of human clinical data when such studies are not feasible or ethical.

1972,Genetic heterogeneity of classical swine fever virus in Central Europe.,"The aim of this work was to genetically characterize Central European classical swine fever virus (CSFV) isolates and to assess the applicability of molecular analysis in the epizootiology of CSFV infections. Thirty-four viruses, derived from Central European pigs or wild boar, were examined. All of these viruses were detected by each of three sets of oligonucleotide primers that had been designed for specific RT-PCR amplification of different genomic regions. Comparative sequence analysis of the PCR products showed that they were of a common genetic type in Western Europe. Further discrimination of the isolated viruses into subgroups closely matching their regions of origin was possible in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Estonia. The discriminative ability of the technique was improved by analyzing a composite data set consisting of all sequence data from all viruses. Using this approach, we were able to distinguish between all viruses and group them in a way that precisely matched their geographic origins, apart from a single Estonian isolate that was grouped with viruses from eastern Poland.",,"Stadejek, T.;VilÄek, Å ;Lowings, J.

This study reports the first identification of PCV3 in Europe, in serum from pigs from Polish farms. A total of 1050 serum samples were collected between 2014 and 2017 from sows and pigs aged 3 to 20 weeks from 14 commercial farms representing different regions of Poland, of different sizes and health status. Samples were pooled 4 to 6 and tested with real-time PCR for PCV3. PCV3 DNA was detected in 12 of 14 farms (85.7%). In PCV3-positive herds, the virus was detected in 5.9% to 65% of serum pools. PCV3 was more common among weaned and finishing piglets (26.1% and 28.0% of the serum groups, respectively). Sequence analysis of the 359 nucleotide fragment of ORF2 showed the highest identity of 99.7% with PCV3-US/SD2016 from the USA.

1975,Venezuelan encephalitis virus markers that distinguish enzootic strains of subtype ID from those of IE,"Strains of Venezuelan encephalitis virus isolated from enzootic habitats during interepizootic periods in Central America and northern South America can be antigenically distinguished from each other by hemagglutination inhibition. This test has provided the basis for the classification of these virus strains into IE and ID subtypes, respectively. Virus strains of these two subtypes have been found to differ profoundly with respect to virulence for English Shorthair guinea pigs. Studies are described confirming that subtype ID virus strains are virulent in guinea pigs, and that virulence is not the result of co-cycling of subpopulations of epizootic subtype I-AB or IC virions. Two additional markers were found that distinguish between ID and IE subtype Venezuelan encephalitis virus strains. First, hydroxyapatite chromatography of intact virions at pH 6.5 showed differential elution of ID and IE prototype strains. Virions from ID subtype strains eluted with 0.08 to 0.11 M phosphate, whereas those from IE subtype strains eluted with 0.15 to 0.20 M phosphate. Second, the isoelectric points of the E1 envelope glycoproteins of the ID and IE prototype strains were significantly different; pH 6.85 to 7.00 and pH 7.25 to 7.30, respectively. There was no significant difference in the isoelectric points of the E2 envelope glycoproteins. These distinctive features most likely reflect a fundamental difference in the surface structure of the virion.",,"Stanick, D. R.;Wiebe, M. E.;Scherer, W. F.",1985.0,,,0
1976,Detection and molecular characterization of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in wild boar populations in Lithuania,"BACKGROUND: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is recognized worldwide as an important and economically devastating pathogen in swine production. Although PRRSV is widespread in domestic pigs, information on PRRSV infection in European wild boar (Sus scrofa) is lacking. The information currently available does not provide conclusive evidence that wild boars are a reservoir of PRRSV. However, wild boars are likely to become infected with domestic pigs through occasional direct or indirect contact. In addition, wild boars can act as a reservoir for infectious diseases of domestic pigs. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to determine the prevalence of the virus and to further explore the epidemiology and diversity of PRRSV strains present in Lithuanian wild boar over a 5-year period. A total of 1597 tissue and serum samples from wild boars inhabiting 44 districts and ten counties in Lithuania were analyzed using conventional nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time Taqman RT-PCR to the detection of open viruses specific for PRRSV. reading frame (ORF) 1 and 6 sequences. RESULTS: PRRSV was very frequent in wild boar populations in Lithuania, with an average rate of 18.66% using conventional RT-PCR and 19.54% using real-time RT-PCR. PRRSV was detected in 36.71 and 41.77% of the 237 game reserves analyzed by conventional RT-nPCR and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. No statistically significant differences in PRRSV prevalence by geographic area were observed in the ten Lithuanian counties. PRRSV-infected animals were identified in all age groups; however, significantly higher prevalence rates were identified in subadult and adult feral pigs than in juveniles up to 12 months of age. No positive results were obtained using conventional PCR with Type 2-specific primers. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF5 region revealed that ten wild boar harbored virus sequences belonging to genetic subtypes 3 and 4 and thus may pose a serious threat. for Lithuanian pig farms where only subtype two strains are circulating. CONCLUSIONS: The results of virus prevalence and phylogenetic analyzes strongly support the role of wild boar as a possible natural reservoir of PRRSV in Lithuania.",,"Stankevicius, A.;Buitkuviene, J.;Sutkiene, V.;Spancerniene, U.;Pampariene, I.;Pautienius, A.;Oberauskas, V.;Zilinskas, H.;Zymantiene, J.",2016.0,,10.1186/s13028-016-0232-5,0
1977,"Analysis of influenza A viruses of subtype H1 from wild birds, turkeys and pigs in Germany reveals cross-species transmission events","Background Despite considerable host species barriers, interspecies transmission of influenza A viruses has been repeatedly demonstrated among wild birds, poultry, and pigs. In particular, viruses of subtypes H1 and H3 were transmitted between pigs and poultry, predominantly turkeys, in regions with a high population density of both species. The recovery of an H1N1 swine influenza virus from a turkey flock in Germany in 2009 prompted us to molecularly investigate recently detected H1 subtype viruses in wild birds, pigs, and poultry. Objectives The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between H1N1 viruses originating from wild and domestic animals in Germany and to identify possible events of transmission or redistribution between species. Methods Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes or complete genome sequences were generated from selected current H1N1 viruses from wild birds, pigs, and turkeys. Phylogenetic analyzes were combined with genotyping and analysis of deduced amino acid sequences for biologically active sites. Antigenic relationships were evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition reactions. Results Phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin sequences showed that viruses from different H1 subgroups co-circulate between domestic animals and wild birds. Furthermore, these viruses comprised different genotypes and were antigenically distinguished. An H1N1 virus isolated from a turkey farm in northern Germany in 2009 showed the greatest similarity to avian-type H1N1 swine influenza viruses circulating in Europe since the late 1970s. Conclusions The data demonstrate genetic heterogeneity and H1 viruses currently circulating in domestic and wild animals in Germany and point to turkeys as a possible bridge between avian and mammalian hosts. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Starick, E.;Fereidouni, S.

1978,DNA viruses encoding circular replication-associated proteins identified in the faeces of several animals in New Zealand,"In recent years, innovations in molecular techniques and sequencing technologies have resulted in a rapid expansion in the number of known viral sequences, particularly those with single-stranded DNA genomes (CRESS) encoding circular replication-associated proteins (Rep ). CRESS DNA viruses are present in the virome of many ecosystems and are known to infect a wide range of organisms. A large number of the recently identified CRESS DNA viruses cannot be classified into any known viral family, indicating that the current view of the CRESS DNA viral sequence space is greatly underestimated. Animal fecal matter has proven to be a particularly useful source for CRESS DNA virus sampling in an ecosystem, as it is cost-effective and non-invasive. In this study, a viral metagenomics approach was used to explore the diversity of CRESS DNA viruses present in the faeces of domestic and wild animals in New Zealand. Thirty-eight complete CRESS DNA viral genomes and two circular molecules (which may be defective molecules or single components of multicomponent genomes) were identified from forty-nine individual animal fecal samples. Based on shared genome organizations and sequence similarities, eighteen of the isolates were classified as gemycircularviruses and twelve isolates were classified as smacoviruses. The remaining eight isolates lack significant sequence similarity to any member of the known CRESS DNA virus groups. This research adds significantly to our knowledge of CRESS DNA viral diversity in New Zealand, emphasizing the prevalence of CRESS DNA viruses in nature and reinforcing the suggestion that a large proportion of CRESS DNA viruses still exist. have not been identified.",,"Steel, O.;Kraberger, S.;Sikorski, A.;Young, L.

1979,"Widespread Recombination, Redistribution, and Transmission of Imbalanced Composite Viral Genotypes in Natural Arenavirus Infections","Arenaviruses are one of the largest families of human hemorrhagic fever viruses and are known to infect both mammals and snakes. Arenaviruses package a large (L) and a small (S) genome segment in their virions. For segmented RNA viruses such as these, new genotypes can be generated through mutation, recombination, and shuffling. Although an ancient recombination event is thought to have led to the emergence of a new lineage of mammalian arenaviruses, neither recombination nor reassortment has been definitively documented in natural arenavirus infections. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to study the viral diversity present in arenavirus-infected captive snakes. From 48 infected animals, we determined the complete or near complete sequence of 210 genome segments that were grouped into 23 L and 11 S genotypes. Most snakes were multiply infected, with up to 4 distinct S segment genotypes and 11 S segments L different in individual animals. This S/L imbalance was typical: in all cases, intrahost L-segment genotypes outnumbered S-genotypes, and a particular S-segment genotype dominated in individual animals and at the population level. We corroborated the results of qRT-PCR sequencing and virus isolation, and isolates replicated as pools in culture. Numerous cases of recombination and shuffling were detected, including recombinant segments with unusual organizations featuring 2 intergenic regions and superfluous content, which were capable of stable replication and transmission despite their atypical structures. In general, this represents intra-host diversity of an extent and form far beyond what has been observed for arenaviruses or for viruses in general. This diversity can plausibly be attributed to captive admixture of subclinically infected wild-caught snakes. Thus, beyond providing a unique opportunity to study arenavirus evolution and adaptation, these findings allow investigation of unintended anthropogenic impacts on viral ecology, diversity, and disease potential.",,"Stenglein, M.

1980,Isolation and cloning of two variants of papillomavirus from domestic pigs: Sus scrofa papillomavirus type 1 variants a and b,"Healthy skin samples were taken from two female domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domestica) with cotton-tipped swabs. Total genomic DNA was extracted from the samples and subjected to PCR with degenerate papillomavirus (PV)-specific primers. Similarity searches performed with BLASTN showed that partial E1 and L1 sequences of two new PVs were amplified. Subsequently, the complete genomes of these Sus scrofa papillomaviruses (SsPV) were amplified by long template PCR, cloned and sequenced by a transposon insertion method. They contained the open reading frames (ORFs) typical of PV E1, E2, E4, E6, L1 and L2, but the E7 ORF was absent in both viruses. Pairwise nucleotide sequence alignment of the SsPV L1 ORFs showed 98.5% similarity, classifying these viruses as SsPV type 1 ""variants"" (SsPV-1a and -1b). Based on a concatenated alignment of the E1, E2, L1, and L2 ORFs of SsPV-1 variants a and b, and 81 other human and animal PV-like species, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed. This phylogenetic analysis showed that the SsPV-1a and -1b variants did not cluster with the other PVs of artiodactyl (cloven-hoofed) host species, but instead clustered at the edge of the Alphapapillomavirus genus, very close to the root of this genus. . © 2008 SGM.",,"Stevens, H.;Rector, A.;van der Kroght, K.;van Ranst, M.",2008.0,,10.1099/vir.0.2008/003186-0,0
1981,Small RNA sequencing and cloning strategy affects viral and host microRNA expression signatures,"The establishment of microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures is the basic element to investigate the role that these regulatory molecules play in the biology of an organism. Marek's disease virus 1 (MDV-1) is an avian herpesvirus that naturally infects chickens and induces T-cell lymphomas. During latency, MDV-1, like other herpesviruses, expresses a limited subset of transcripts. . These include three groups of miRNAs. Several studies identified the expression of host-encoded virus and miRNA from cell cultures and chickens infected with MDV-1. But a large discrepancy was observed when miRNA cloning frequencies obtained from different cloning and sequencing protocols were compared. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of small RNA library preparation and sequencing on miRNA frequencies obtained from the same RNA samples collected during MDV-1 infection of chickens at different steps of oncoviral pathogenesis. Qualitative and quantitative variations were found in the data, depending on the strategy used. One of the latency-associated transcript (LAT)-derived mature miRNAs, mdv1-miR-M7-5p, showed the greatest variation. Its cloning frequency was 50% of viral miRNA counts when a small-scale sequencing approach was used. Its frequency was 100 times less abundant when determined through the deep sequencing approach. Northern blot analysis showed a better correlation with the miRNA frequencies found by the small-scale sequencing approach. By analyzing the cellular miRNA repertoire, we also found a gap between the two sequencing approaches. Taken together, our study indicates that next-generation sequencing data considered alone is limited in assessing the absolute copy number of transcripts. Therefore, small RNA quantification should be approached by compiling data obtained using different techniques, such as microarrays, qRT-PCR, and NB analysis in support of high-throughput sequencing data. These observations should be taken into account when studying miRNA variations before addressing functional studies. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,"Stik, G.;Muylkens, B.;Coupeau, D.;Laurent, S.;Dambrine, G.;Messmer, M.;Chane-Woon-Ming, B.;Pfeffer, S.;Rasschaert, D.",2014.0,,10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.04.005,0
1982,Molecular and biological characteristics of avian polyomaviruses: Isolates from different species of birds indicate that avian polyomaviruses form a distinct subgenus within the genus polyomavirus,"The isolation and characterization of two avian polyomaviruses, a chicken (BFDV-2) and a parrot (BFDV-3), are reported. Both isolates are closely related to budgerigar disease virus (BFDV) isolated from budgerigars (now called BFDV-1), and all three viral genomes are shown to have the same basic size of 4981 bp. However, a 151 bp insert was observed in the noncoding region of BFDV-2 representing an exact duplication of the left half of the noncoding region, including the putative early promoter and the amino terminus of the large T antigen. With another 15 base pairs swapped elsewhere throughout the three genomes, these viruses have varying degrees of tropism for various bird species. The production of antibodies directed against a fusion protein β-galactosidase-large T antigen of BFDV-1 is described. These antibodies detected the large T antigen, with an M(r) of approximately 80K, and the small t antigen, with an M(r) of approximately 24K, in cells infected with BFDV isolates. While these antibodies bind with low affinity to the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen, SV40 or mouse polyomavirus-specific antibodies will not bind to the BFDV large T antigen. Antibodies directed against the structural polypeptides of BFDV exhibit extensive reciprocal cross-reactivities with all three structural proteins of mammalian polyomaviruses. The importance of polyomavirus infections in several bird species is discussed. On the basis of unique structural and biological properties, we propose that these viruses be placed in a distinct subgenus (Avipolyomavirus) within the polyomaviruses.",,"Stoll, R.;Luo, D.;Kouwenhoven, B.;Hobom, G.;Muller, H.",1993.0,,,0
1983,Whole genome sequencing demonstrates that geographic variation of Escherichia coli O157 genotypes dominates host association,"Genetic variation in an infectious disease pathogen may be driven by ecological niche differences arising from different host species and different geographic locations. Whole genome sequencing was used to compare isolates of E. coli O157 from reservoir hosts (cattle and sheep) from Scotland and to compare the genetic variation of isolates (human, animal, environmental/dietary) obtained from Scotland, New Zealand, Netherlands, Canada and the UNITED STATES. Nei's genetic distance calculated from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the core genome showed that the isolated animals were from the same population. Investigation of Shiga toxin bacteriophage and its insertion sites (SBI typing) revealed that cattle and sheep isolates had statistically indistinguishable rarefaction, diversity, and genotype profiles. In contrast, isolates from different countries exhibited significant differences in Nei genetic distance and SBI typing. Thus, after successful international transmission, which has occurred on multiple occasions, local genetic variation occurs, resulting in a global mosaic of continental and transcontinental phylogeographic clades. These findings are important for three reasons: first, to understand the transmission and evolution of infectious diseases associated with multiple host reservoirs and multi-geographic locations; second, highlighting the relevance of the sheep reservoir when considering farm-based interventions; and third, to improve our understanding of why the incidence of human disease varies around the world.",,"Strachan, N.

These genotypes are divided into subtypes based on phylogenetic analysis, namely ap for BVDV-1 and ac for BVDV-2. Within this study, the genetic heterogeneity of BVDV-1 in England and Wales was investigated and compared to the situation in 1996/1997. Viral RNA was extracted from 316 blood samples collected between 2004 and 2009 that were previously identified as positive for BVDV-1.

Phylogenetic analysis of the 5'UTR demonstrated the existence of five subtypes of BVDV-1 circulating in England and Wales, namely BVDV-1a (244 samples), BVDV-1b (50), BVDV-1e (3), BVDV-1f (1) and BVDV-1i (18). Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the Npro region of the viral genome supported the classification obtained with the 5'UTR. Given that only three subtypes were detected in 1999, this report supports the idea that the repopulation of cattle from continental Europe, after mass culling during the FMD outbreak in 2001 and the culling of cattle due to bovine tuberculosis infection, The genetic diversity of BVDV-1 subtypes has increased in England and Wales in the last 10 years. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",,"Strong, R.;Errington, J.;Cook, R.;Ross-Smith, N.;Wakeley, P.;Steinbach, F.",2013.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.09.006,0

Phylogenetically, the virus was most closely related to psittacid herpesvirus, but demonstrated sufficient nucleotide and amino acid diversity to be considered a new alphaherpesvirus. It is proposed that the psittacid herpesvirus described above be designated psittacid herpesvirus 1 (PsHV-1), and this new species classified as psittacid herpesvirus 2 (PsHV-2). It is speculated that PsHV-2 co-evolved with the African Gray Parrot and therefore should be present in these birds in the wild. © 2005 Houghton Trust Ltd.",,"Styles, D. K.;Tomaszewski, E.

This study sequenced the partial helicase and capsid gene of the potentially novel avian hepatitis E virus (HEV) isolated from HRHS chickens and tested its pathogenicity in SPF chickens, while the appearance of clinical signs, histopathological changes, viral distribution , viremia and viral excretion were monitored for 14 days post infection (dpi). Analysis revealed that HRHS-associated avian HEV belongs to a new genotype, and infected chicks developed typical HRHS symptoms. Therefore, this study successfully developed an experimental infection model to study the pathogenicity and role of the novel avian HEV in HRHS. Meanwhile, the new avian HEV existed primarily in the liver and spleen, inducing rapid viraemia and chronic viral shedding in infected chicks, and could cause 40% mortality by 14 dpi. In conclusion, this study found the new avian HEV genotype and confirmed its role in HRHS.",,"Su, Q.;Li, Y.;Meng, F.;Cui, Z.;Chang, S.;Zhao, P.",2018.0,Aug,,0
1991,Characterization of H7N2 avian influenza virus in wild birds and pikas in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau area,"Qinghai Lake is an important breeding site for migratory birds that has experienced several recent highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) epizootics. From 2006 to 2009 we surveyed Qinghai wild birds and pikas for evidence of AIV infections. We sampled 941 healthy wild animals and isolated seventeen H7N2 viruses (eight from pikas and nine from wild birds). H7N2 viruses were closely related phylogenetically to each other and to viruses isolated in Hong Kong in the 1970s. We determined the pathogenicity of H7N2 viruses by infecting chickens and mice. Our results suggest that pikas could play an important role in the ecology of AIVs, acting as intermediate hosts in which viruses are better adapted to mammals. Our findings of AI infection in pikas are consistent with previous observations and raise the possibility that pikas may play a previously unrecognized role in the ecology of AIV peridomestic aquatic environments.",,"Su, S.;Xing, G.;Wang, J.;Li, Z.;Gu, J.;Yan, L.;Lei, J.;Ji, S.;Hu, B.;Gray, G.

1992,Rybp gene overexpression inhibits differentiation of bovine myoblasts into myotubes,"The RING1 and YY1 binding protein (Rybp) genes inhibit myogenesis in mice, but there are no reports on the effects of these genes in cattle. The aim of this study is to investigate the roles of the Rybp gene in bovine skeletal muscle development and myoblast differentiation. In the present study, the Rybp gene was overexpressed in bovine myoblasts via adenoviruses. RNA-seq was performed to detect differentially expressed genes (DEG). The results showed that overexpression of the Rybp gene inhibits myotube formation. Morphological differences in myoblasts began on the second day and were highly significant 6 days after adenovirus induction. A total of 1311 DEG (707 upregulated and 604 downregulated) were examined using RNA-seq between myoblasts with added negative control adenovirus (AD-NC) and adenovirus Rybp (AD-Rybp) after 6 days of induction. . Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis revealed that downregulated DEGs were primarily involved in muscle-related biological functions and, of the 32 pathways, those associated with muscle development were significantly enriched for the identified DEGs. This study may not only provide a theoretical basis for the regulation of skeletal muscle development in cattle by exploring the roles of the Rybp gene in myoblast differentiation, but also may lay a theoretical basis for molecular breeding in cattle. .",,"Su, X.;Zhao, Y.;Wang, Y.;Zhang, L.;Zan, L.;Wang, H.",2018.0,2018-07-01 00:00:00,,0
1993,Isolation and genetic characterization of a new adeno-associated virus from Muscovy ducks in China,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV; genus Dependoparvovirus, family Parvoviridae) was first discovered in 1965 as a contaminant in adenovirus preparations. AAVs are generally considered nonpathogenic and have the ability to attenuate the replication of other, more pathogenic viruses, making them attractive as potential therapeutic or preventative measures. This study characterized a new AAV isolated from Muscovy ducks in China. The new virus (MHH-05-2015) was isolated after propagating a field isolate of DAdV-3 virus (a type 3 duck adenovirus) in duck embryo fibroblasts. The complete genome sequence of MHH-05-2015 was determined and the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared with other avian AAVs. The genomic distribution of structural and nonstructural protein-coding genes in MHH-05-2015 was conserved and consistent with the other AAVs. Compared to previously isolated avian AAVs, MHH-05-2015 had approximately 63-64% sequence identity. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that MHH-05-2015 clustered separately from other avian AAVs, suggesting that MHH-05-2015 was not directly descended from other members of the Dependoparvovirus family. These results suggest that MHH-05-2015 is a new AAV subtype that is distinct from other avian AAVs.",,"Su, X. N.;Liu, J. J.;Zhou, Q. F.;Zhang, X. H.;Zhao, L. C.;Xie, Q. M.;Chen, W.

1994,Companion Animal Symposium: Microbes and Gastrointestinal Health of Dogs and Cats Review,"Recent molecular studies have revealed complex communities of bacteria, fungi, archaea, and viruses in the gastrointestinal tract of dogs and cats. More than 10 bacterial phyla have been identified, with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria constituting more than 99% of the entire gut microbiota. Microbes act as a defensive barrier against invading pathogens, aid in digestion, provide nutritional support to enterocytes, and play a crucial role in the development of the immune system. Of importance to gastrointestinal health is its ability to ferment dietary substrates into short-chain fatty acids, predominantly acetate, propionate, and butyrate. However, microbes can also have a detrimental effect on the health of the host. Specific pathogens (eg, Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens) have been implicated in acute and chronic gastrointestinal disease. Changes in the composition of the small intestinal microbiota, which may lead to changes in intestinal permeability and digestive function, in canine small intestinal dysbiosis, or in antibiotic-responsive diarrhea, have been suggested. There is increasing evidence that microbes play an important role in the pathogenesis of canine and feline inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Current theories for the development of IBD favor a combination of environmental factors, the gut microbiota, and a genetic susceptibility of the host. Recent studies have revealed a genetic susceptibility to defective bacterial shedding in Boxer dogs with granulomatous colitis. Differential expression of pathogen recognition receptors (ie, Toll-like receptors) was identified in dogs with chronic enteropathies. Similar to humans, a microbial dysbiosis has been identified in feline and canine IBD. Commonly observed microbial changes are an increase in Proteobacteria (ie, Escherichia coli) with simultaneous decreases in Firmicutes, especially reduced diversity in Clostridium groups XIVa and IV (ie, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium spp.). This would indicate that these bacterial groups, important producers of short-chain fatty acids, may play an important role in promoting intestinal health.",,"Suchodolski, J. S.",2011.0,May,,0
1995,Viruses detected in cecal content of healthy pigs representing a new genetic group in genogroup II of the genus 'Norwalk-like viruses',"Viruses of the 'Norwalk-like virus' (NLV) genus detected in humans have been genetically classified into two large genetic groups, genogroups I and II (GI and GII), which together are made up of at least 14 genetic subgroups. However, a comparable classification of NLV in other species remains to be performed. We sequenced a 2 kb region from the RNA polymerase gene to the 3” end of the open reading frame 2 (ORF2) of two NLV strains previously detected in the cecal contents of healthy pigs. The complete ORF2 sequences of these two NLV strains were analyzed for their genetic relationships to 15 human strains, which have already been reported and used as references for the genetic classification of human NLV strains, and two additional strains; one, a recently reported human strain that appears to represent a new genetic subgroup of GII; and the other, an NLV animal strain. Analysis of a matrix showing pairwise identities and neighbor-joining tree topology showed that the two pig strains could be classified into a new GII genetic subgroup on the basis of the complete capsid protein amino acid sequences. .

1996,Differentiation of respiratory syncytial virus subgroups with cDNA probes in a nucleic acid hybridization assay,"new approach was developed for the determination of respiratory syncytial virus (RS) subgroups by using a simple nucleic acid filter hybridization technique. By this method, virus-infected cells are attached and fixed in a single step, and the viral RNA in the fixed cell preparation is directly characterized by its ability to hybridize with cDNA probes specific for RS virus subgroups A or B. . Subgroup-specific probes were constructed from cDNA clones that corresponded to a portion of the extracellular domain of the RS virus G protein from an RS virus subgroup B (8/60) or an RS virus subgroup A (A2). . The cDNA probes were 32 P-labelled and used to analyze RS virus isolates collected over a period of three decades. Replicate templates of cell preparations infected with subgroup A or B probe were hybridized. Subgroup assignments of 40 viruses tested by nucleic acid hybridization were consistent with the results of subgroup determinations based on their reactivities with monoclonal antibodies, which it has previously been the only method available to determine the subgroup classification of RS virus isolates. The nucleic acid hybridization assay has the advantage of providing broad-based discrimination of the two subgroups on the basis of nucleic acid homology, regardless of minor antigenic differences detected in antibody-based assays. monoclonal.

Unlike previously published bELISAs that require reagent production, end-user handling, or have not been evaluated for use with mammalian and avian species, this assay is performed using a commercially available recombinant nucleoprotein antigen and the corresponding nucleoprotein-specific monoclonal antibody. and has been shown to work with multiple species of birds and mammals. The efficacy of bELISA as a serum screening assay was compared with the agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) assay using 251 serum samples obtained from experimentally infected mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and raccoons (Procyon lotor). Agreement between AGID and bELISA was 94.1% (95% CI=89.9, 98.3) for raccoons, and 71.2% (95% CI=63.5, 78.9 ) for mallard ducks and 82.8% (95% CI=78.2, 87.3) overall. The bELISA was more sensitive than the AGID assay, as evidenced by detection of influenza A virus antibodies at earlier time points in experimental infection studies and at higher serial dilutions. The efficacy of bELISA in monitoring natural exposure to influenza A virus was also compared to the AGID assay using an additional 745 serum samples from six species of birds and six species of mammals. This bELISA provides a rapid, reliable, and inexpensive technique for large-scale surveillance of influenza A virus exposure in taxonomically diverse vertebrate species.",,"Sullivan, H.

Here, seven PBV RT-PCR positive fecal samples from children with diarrhea and four fecal samples from healthy children as controls were analyzed by viral metagenomics. The results indicated that all seven diarrheal fecal samples contained high titers of PBV sequences, while three of the controls were negative and one had low titers of PBV. Three of the diarrheal stool samples also tested positive for other viruses, including anellovirus, human gyrovirus, human parechovirus, and swine faeces-associated circular virus. PBV sequences from all seven patients were assembled, generating seven large contigs with the complete ORF of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).

To understand the epidemiological characteristics of pseudorabies virus (PRV) strains currently prevalent in China, a total of 16,256 samples collected from pig farms suspected of PRV infection in 27 provinces of China between 2012 and 2017 were evaluated for PRV detection. Since the extensive use of gE-deleted PRV vaccine in China, PRV-gE was applied to determine wild-type virus infection by PCR. Of the 16,256 samples detected, approximately 1,345 samples tested positive for PRV-gE, yielding an average positive rate of 8.27%. The PRV positive detection rates from 2012 to 2017 were 11.92% (153/1284), 12.19% (225/1846), 6.70% (169/2523), 11.10% (269/2424 ), 5.57% (147/2640), and 6.90% (382/5539), respectively. To understand the genetic characteristics of currently circulating PRV strains, 25 PRV strains isolated from those PRV-gE positive samples were selected for further investigation. Phylogenetic analysis based on gB, gC, and gE showed that PRV strains prevalent in China had a markedly different evolutionary relationship with PRVs from other countries, which could explain the observation that the Bartha-K61 vaccine failed to provide protection. total against emerging strains. Sequence alignments identified many amino acid changes within the gB, gC, and gE proteins of PRVs circulating in China after the outbreak compared with those from other countries or those prevalent in China before the outbreak; those changes could also affect the protective efficacy of vaccines previously used in China, as well as being associated in part with the increased virulence of current PRV epidemic strains in China.",,"Sun, Y.;Liang, W.;Liu, Q.;Zhao, T.;Zhu, H.;Hua, L.;Peng, Z.;Tang, X.;Stratton, C.

2000,"Novel triple reassortment H1N1 swine influenza viruses in pigs in Tianjin, North China","Pigs are susceptible to human and avian influenza viruses and therefore have been proposed as mixing vessels for the generation of pandemic influenza viruses through reassortment. In this study, for the first time, we report the isolation and genetic analyzes of three novel triple reassortment H1N1 swine influenza viruses from pigs in Tianjin, northern China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these new viruses contained genes from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 lineages (PB2, PB1, PA, and NP), Eurasian pigs (HA, NA, and M), and triple reassignment pigs (NS). This indicated that reassortment between pandemic 2009 H1N1, Eurasian swine, and triple reassortant influenza viruses had occurred in pigs in Tianjin and resulted in the generation of new viruses. In addition, three human-type H1N1, two classical swine H1N1, and two Eurasian swine H1N1 viruses were also isolated during swine influenza virus surveillance from 2009 to 2013, indicating that multiple genetic lineages of swine H1N1 viruses were co-circulating in the pig population. in Tianjin, China.

2005,"Past, present and future of hepatitis E virus infection: zoonotic perspectives","The origin of hepatitis E virus (HEV) is not fully understood, but it is considered an emerging zoonotic pathogen. To date, HEV has been isolated from many animal species. The family Hepeviridae consists of two genera. The genus Orthohepevirus includes four distinct species (A, B, C, and D), each with distinct genotypes. Within the Orthohepevirus A species, the host ranges of HEV-1 and HEV-2 are restricted to humans, while genotypes 3 and 4 primarily infect a wide range of diverse animal species, as well as being zoonotic to humans. . Pig and wild boar species were previously thought to be the main natural reservoir of HEV, but recently rabbits have also been identified as the main carriers. Additionally, the increasing number of HEV infections within the food supply chain underscores the important role of agricultural and food processing practices in limiting transmission of the virus. In particular, a commercial Chinese vaccine has the potential to protect humans and possibly animal reservoirs from HEV infection.

2007,A wide degree of inter-strain diversity in virulent strains and vaccines of Alphaherpesviruses,"Alphaherpesviruses are widespread in the human population and include herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2, and varicella zoster virus (VZV). These viral pathogens cause epithelial injury and then infect the nervous system to cause lifelong latency, reactivation, and spread. A related veterinary herpesvirus, pseudorabies (PRV), causes a similar disease in cattle resulting in significant economic loss. The vaccines developed for VZV and PRV serve as useful models for the development of an HSV-1 vaccine. We present comparisons of whole genome sequences of the PRV Bartha vaccine strain and two virulent PRV isolates, Kaplan and Becker. These genomic sequences were determined by high-throughput sequencing and assembly and present new insights into the attenuation of a mammalian alphaherpesvirus vaccine strain. We found many previously unknown coding differences between PRV Bartha and virulent strains, including changes in gH and gB fusion proteins, and more than forty other viral proteins. Strain variation in PRV protein sequences is much closer to levels previously observed for HSV-1 than for the highly stable VZV proteome. Nearly 20% of the PRV genome contains tandem short sequence repeats (SSRs), a class of nucleic acid motifs whose length variation has been associated with changes in DNA-binding site efficiency, transcriptional regulation, and protein interactions. We found SSRs in the entire herpesvirus family and provide the first global characterization of SSRs in viruses, both within and between strains. We found SSR length variation between different isolates of PRV and HSV-1, which may provide a new mechanism for the phenotypic variation between strains. Finally, we detected a small number of polymorphic bases within each plaque-purified PRV strain and characterized the effect of passage and plaque purification on these polymorphisms. These data add to growing evidence that even plaque-purified stocks of stable DNA viruses exhibit limited sequence heterogeneity, likely leading to future strain evolution. © 2011 Szpara et al.",,"Szpara, M.

2008,A new microplate neutralization test for herpes simplex virus typing,"microplate serum neutralization test for the estimation of complement-requiring neutralizing antibodies (CRN) was established as the first step to simplify herpes simplex virus (HSV) typing. When guinea pigs were immunized with HSV type 2, late sera were mostly able to differentiate HSV types better than sera from hyperimmune rabbits, with the CRN titer against heterologous HSV type 1 being much lower than the homologous titer. Sera from guinea pigs immunized with HSV type 1 showed approximately the same level of cross-reactivity against HSV type 2 as rabbit antisera. Sera were selected from guinea pigs that had minimal levels of cross-reactivity, and their high dilution (1:160) and complement were added to serial 10-fold dilutions of virus in microplate titration of virus infectivity. Selective reduction of virus titer by any antiserum could determine the type of HSV. No equivocal intermediate cases were found between various parent strains, including many recent isolates. The typing result agreed with that determined by a modification of the method of Yang et al based on virus titers obtained with Vero and primary chick embryo cells.

These results suggested that phylogenetic analysis of the E2 gene was most useful for the identification of subgenotypes within BVDV1. © 2004 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Tajima, M.",2004.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2003.11.011,0
2010,Molecular characterization of a new hepatitis E virus (HEV) strain obtained from a wild boar in Japan that is markedly different from previously recognized HEV strains,"Although there is currently no consensus classification system for hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes, variants of HEV (JBOAR135-Shiz09 and wbJOY_06) from wild boar (Sus scrofa leucomystax) have been provisionally classified into two new genotypes (5 and 6). Conducting a survey of HEV infections among 566 wild boars captured in Japan between January 2010 and August 2013, we found 24 boars (4.2%) with ongoing HEV infections: 13 had HEV genotype 3, 10 had HEV genotype 3, genotype 4 and the wild boar remainder possessed a new HEV variant (designated wbJNN_13). The complete genome of wbJNN_13 consisted of 7247 nucleotides, excluding the poly(A) tail, and was highly divergent from known genotype 1 to 4 HEV isolates derived from humans, pigs, wild boars, deer, mongoose, and rabbits by 22 0.4-28.2%, JBOAR135-Shiz09 and wbJOY_06 by 19.6-21.9% and HEV isolates from rat, ferret, bat and bird by 40.9-46.1% genome-wide. Phylogenetic trees confirmed that wbJNN_13 is distantly related to all known HEV isolates. A Simplot analysis revealed no significant recombination between existing HEV strains. These results indicate the presence of at least three genetic lineages of HEV strains presumably indigenous to wild boar. Further studies are warranted to fully understand the extent of genomic heterogeneity of HEV variants infecting wild boar. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",,"Takahashi, M.;Nishizawa, T.;Nagashima, S.;Jirintai, S.;Kawakami, M.;Sonoda, Y.;Suzuki, T.;Yamamoto, S.;Shigemoto, K.;Ashida, K.;Sato, Y.;Okamoto, H.",2014.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2013.12.014,0
2011,Phylogenetic characterization of H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated in Indonesia between 2003 and 2007,"The wide distribution of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses is a global threat to human health. Indonesia has had the highest number of human infections and deaths caused by these viruses. To understand the enzootic conditions of viruses in Indonesia, twenty-four H5N1 viruses isolated from poultry between 2003 and 2007 were phylogenetically characterized. Although previous studies exclusively classified Indonesian viruses into clades 2.1.1-2.1.3, our phylogenetic analyzes showed a new sublineage that did not belong to any of the current clades. Furthermore, new reassortant viruses that arose between this new sublineage and other clades were identified in 2005-2006 on the island of Java. H5N1 viruses were introduced from the island of Java to Sulawesi, Kalimantan, and the island of Sumatra on multiple occasions between 2003 and 2007, causing the geographic spread of these viruses in Indonesia. These findings identify the island of Java as the epicenter of the spread of the H5N1 virus in Indonesia. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,"Takano, R.;Nidom, C.

2014,A marker of thymus cells in murine leukemia virus-induced lymphomas of rats,"Rosetting between thymus cells and guinea pig erythrocytes showed a specific marker for an immature population of rat thymus cells. This method was used to classify rat lymphomas induced by murine leukemia virus. Eight of the nine Gross virus-induced rat lymphoma lines, which originated in the thymus, formed rosettes; while Friend, Rauscher, or Moloney virus-induced rat lymphoma lines, which originated from the thymus, spleen, or mesenteric lymph nodes, did not form rosettes. The percentage of total cells that formed rosettes in the macroscopic lymphoma lines decreased with in vivo passage. If the tumor cells were exposed to trypsin treatment, then the tumor cells would form rosettes. Lymphoma lines lacking rosetting cells showed no rosetting after trypsin treatment. An immunofluorescence test showed that none of the lymphoma lines induced by Gross, Friend, Rauscher, or Moloney viruses carried the characteristic surface immunoglobulin of B cells. These results suggest that Gross lymphomas may derive from the thymic cortex and that Friend, Rauscher, or Moloney lymphomas may be derived from mature thymic cells (cells that do not form rosettes) or from a subpopulation of the B-cell series that do not have the surface immunoglobulin G receptor.",,"Takeichi, N.;Suzuki, K.;Kobayashi, H.",1979.0,,,0
2015,Swine influenza A virus (IAV-S) in Vietnam from 2010 to 2015: Multiple introductions of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in the swine population and diversification of genetic constellations of enzootic IAV-S,"Active surveillance for swine influenza A viruses (IAV-S) in 262 farms and 10 slaughterhouses in seven provinces in northern and southern Vietnam between 2010 and 2015 yielded 388 isolates from 32 farms; these viruses were classified into subtypes H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2. Whole genome sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolates represented 15 genotypes, based on the genetic constellation of the eight segments. All H1N1 viruses were fully A(H1N1) pdm09 viruses, while all H1N2 and H3N2 viruses were reassortments between 5 distinct ancestral viruses: H1 and H3 triple rearrangement (TR) IAV-S that originated in North America before 2009 human seasonal H1, human seasonal H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Notably, 93% of the rearranged IAV-Ss retained M genes that were derived from A(H1N1)pdm09, suggesting some advantage in terms of host adaptation. Monte Carlo Bayesian Markov chain analysis revealed that multiple introductions of A(H1N1)pdm09 and TR IAV-S into the Vietnamese pig population have driven the genetic diversity of currently circulating Vietnamese IAV-S. Furthermore, our results indicate that a rearranged IAV-S with human-like H3 and N2 genes and an M gene of A(H1N1)pdm09 origin likely caused a human case in Ho Chi Minh City in 2010. Our current findings indicate that humans - Transmission to pigs, as well as co-circulation of different IAV-S, have contributed to the diversification of IAV-S gene constellations in Vietnam.",,"Takemae, N.;Harada, M.;Nguyen, P.

2017,Evaluation of methods for sequencing the complete genome of avian avulavirus-1,"Background: Avian avulavirus-1 (AAvV-1, formerly Newcastle disease virus) is responsible for disease outbreaks in poultry and wild birds. Numerous whole genome sequencing methods have been reported for this virus. These methods included cloning, specific primer amplification, shotgun PCR approaches, sequence-independent single primer amplification, and next-generation sequencing platform kits. Methods: Three methods were used to sequence 173 field isolates of Israeli avian avulavirus-1 and one vaccine strain (VH). Sequencing was performed on the Proton and Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine and, to a lesser extent, on the Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq sequencers. Target-specific primers (SP) and sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) products sequenced via the Ion Torrent sequencer had a high error rate and truncated genomes. All sequencing kits on the Next Generation Sequencing Platform generated high sequence accuracy and near complete genome size. Results: A high level of mutations was observed in the intergenic regions between the avian avulavirus-1 genes. Within genes, several regions are more mutated than the Fusion region currently used for typing. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that whole genome sequencing with the Ion Torrent sequencing kit is sufficient.

2018,Evaluation of Wide Range PCR Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry System (PCR/ESI-MS) and Virus Microarrays for Virus Detection,"Advanced nucleic acid-based technologies are powerful research tools for new virus discovery, but need to be standardized for broader applications, such as virus detection in biologics and clinical samples. We have used well-characterized retrovirus stocks to assess the limit of detection (LOD) for wide-range PCR with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS or PLEX-ID), RT-PCR assays, and virus microarrays. . The results indicated that, in the absence of background cellular nucleic acids, PLEX-ID and RT-PCR had a similar LOD for xenotropic murine retrovirus-related virus (XMRV; 3.12 particles per μL), whereas the sensitivity of virus detection was 10-fold higher using virus microarrays. When the virus was added to a background of cellular nucleic acids, the LOD using PLEX-ID remained the same, while virus detection by RT-PCR was 10-fold less sensitive and microarrays failed to detect any virus. Expected endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences were detected in the cell lines tested and known species-specific viral sequences were detected in bovine serum and porcine trypsin. A screening strategy using PCR amplification, nucleotide sequencing, and bioinformatics was developed to demonstrate that a RD114-like retrovirus sequence that was detected by PLEX-ID in canine cell lines (Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and canine thymus Cf2Th ) was due to defective gammaretrovirus-related endogenous sequences. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Taliaferro, L.

2019,Circulation of highly virulent avian infectious bursalitis virus in Finland,"In spring 2014, infectious bursal disease (IBD) was confirmed in a Finnish layer flock with clinical signs and increased mortality. Organ and blood samples were sent for diagnosis to the Finnish Food Safety Authority in Evira. IBD virus (IBDV) was detected in RT-PCR studies. In total, hens from six layer farms associated with increased mortality (7-10%, worst case 30%) were diagnosed with IBD during 2014. Antibodies were also detected with IBD-ELISA tests in hens from two farms. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the causative agent of the 2014 IBD outbreak was a highly virulent type of non-reassortant IBDV. Representative virus strains from previous IBD outbreaks in 1978, 1987, and 1993 were also included in the analysis. The strains isolated in 2014 and 1993 were very similar, indicating the circulation of a very virulent IBDV for more than 20 years in the country.

2020,A generic assay for whole genome amplification and deep sequencing of enterovirus A71,"Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) has become the leading cause of large outbreaks of severe and sometimes fatal hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) throughout the Asia- Peaceful. Outbreaks of EV-A71 have been associated with (sub)genogroup changes, sometimes accompanied by recombination events. Therefore, understanding the population dynamics of EV-A71 is essential to understanding this emerging infection and may provide critical insights for vaccine development. Despite the public health burden of EV-A71, relatively few complete genome sequences of EV-A71 are available for analysis and from limited geographic locations. The availability of an efficient procedure for whole genome sequencing would stimulate efforts to generate more viral sequence data. Herein, we report for the first time the development of a next-generation sequencing-based protocol for whole genome sequencing of EV-A71 directly from clinical samples. We were able to sequence viruses from subgenogroups C4 and B5, while RNA from culture materials of various EV-A71 subgenogroups belonging to genogroups B and C was successfully amplified. The nature of intrahost genetic diversity was explored in 22 clinical samples, revealing 107 positions with minor variants (ranging from 0 to 15 variants per sample). Our analysis of EV-A71 strains sampled in 2013 showed that they all belonged to the B5 subgenogroup, representing the first report of this subgenogroup in Vietnam.

2022,Suppression of coronavirus replication by cyclophilin inhibitors,"Coronaviruses infect a variety of mammalian and avian species and cause serious illness in humans, cats, mice, and birds in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), mouse hepatitis, and avian infectious bronchitis, respectively. . . No effective vaccine or treatment has been developed for SARS-coronavirus or the FIP virus, both of which cause deadly diseases. It has been reported that a cyclophilin inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA), could inhibit the replication of coronaviruses. CsA is a well-known immunosuppressive drug that binds to cellular cyclophilins to inhibit calcineurin, a calcium-calmodulin-activated specific serine/threonine phosphatase. Inhibition of calcineurin blocks the translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells from the cytosol to the nucleus, thus preventing the transcription of genes encoding cytokines such as interleukin-2. Cyclophilins are peptidyl-prolyl isomerases with physiological functions that have been described for many years to include chaperone and foldase activities. Furthermore, many viruses require cyclophilins to replicate; these include human immunodeficiency virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and hepatitis C virus. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to suppression of viral replication differ for different viruses. This review describes the suppressive effects of CsA on coronavirus replication. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Tanaka, Y.;Sato, Y.;Sasaki, T.",2013.0,,10.3390/v5051250,0

2024,Metagenomics for the discovery of new human viruses,"Modern laboratory techniques for the detection of new human viruses are greatly needed as clinicians and epidemiologists increasingly deal with infectious diseases caused by new or previously unrecognized pathogens. There are many clinical syndromes in which viruses are suspected to play a role, but for which traditional microbiology techniques routinely fail to discover the etiologic agent. Additionally, new viruses continue to challenge the human population due to encroachment of human settlements into animal and livestock habitats, globalization, climate change, the increasing number of immunocompromised people, and bioterrorism. Metagenomics-based tools such as microarrays and high-throughput sequencing are ideal for meeting these challenges. Panviral microarrays, which contain sequences representative of all known viruses, have been used to detect new and distantly related variants of known viruses.

2025,"Molecular evolution of Japanese encephalitis virus isolates from pigs in Oita, Japan, during 1980-2009","To identify patterns of genetic change of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) strains circulating in Oita, the entire envelope (E) gene was sequenced for 35 pig isolates over a 30-year period. Based on the deduced nucleotide and amino acid sequences, genetic variation was examined, phylogeny was estimated, and selection pressures were also analyzed. This study showed that the main genotype (G) of JEV isolates had changed from GIII to GI in the mid-1990s in Oita. The selection intensities acting on the Oita GIII and GI strains were found to be almost the same. It suggests that the intensity of selection might not be the reason for such a genotype shift observed in Oita. Pairwise comparisons revealed the high conservation of the E gene at the protein level. Compared to Oita GIII strains, all Oita GI strains shared four amino acid changes at E129 (TM), E222 (AS), E327 (ST), and E366 (AS). Among the 70 JEV isolates involved in this article, GI strains shared only one amino acid change in E222 (AS) compared to GIII strains. No strong evidence of positive selection was found, JEV evolution has generally been subject to strong purifying selection, but an ongoing evolutionary pathway was found to be under relaxed purifying selection in Oita.

2026,Isolation and characterization of influenza A H3N2 virus from turkeys,"Five separate 34-week-old breeding turkey flocks of 2,550 birds each on a single farm in Ohio experienced a drop in egg production from late January to early February 2004. Tracheal swabs (n = 60) , cloacal swabs (n = 50), and convalescent sera (n = 110) from the flocks were sent to the laboratory for diagnosis. Virus isolation was attempted in specific pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs and Vero and MDCK cells. Virus characterization was performed by agar gel immunodiffusion, hemagglutination test, hemagglutination inhibition test, virus neutralization test, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. A suspected influenza virus was successfully propagated and isolated at first passage in MDCK cells, but not initially in Vero cells or specific pathogen-free chicken embryos. After two passages in MDCK cells, it was possible to propagate the isolate in specific pathogen-free chicken embryos. Preliminary sequence analysis of the isolated virus confirmed it to be an influenza A virus with almost 100% identity (235/236) to the parent gene of a swine influenza A virus, A/Swine/Illinois/100084/01 (H1N2). However, it was not possible to subtype the virus using conventional serotyping methods. The results of the genetic characterization of the isolated virus showed that it was subtype H3N2 and was designated A/Turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2). Phylogenetic analysis of the eight genetic segments of the virus showed that the A/Turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2) isolate was most closely related to the triple reassortant H3N2 swine viruses [A/Swine/WI/14094/99 (H3N2 ) ] that has been circulating among swine in the United States since 1998, containing gene segments from avian, swine, and human viruses. The A/Turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2) isolated from turkeys in this study was classified as a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus because it only caused a drop in egg production with other minor clinical signs and no mortality.",,"Tang, Y.;Lee, C.

Previous studies have indicated that PRRSV RNA synthesis correlated with HP-PRRSV virulence. PRRSV RNA synthesis includes genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNA, and these processes require negative-stranded RNA as a template. However, the mechanisms involved in PRRSV negative-strand RNA synthesis are not completely understood. A mini-genome system can be used to assess viral replication mechanisms and assess the effects of potential antiviral drugs on viral replicase activities. In this study, we developed a mini-genome system that uses firefly luciferase as a reporter. Based on this system, we found that PRRSV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp9 alone was unable to activate virus negative-strand RNA synthesis.

2031,Combining comprehensive analysis of off-site lambda phage integration with a CRISPR-based means to characterize downstream physiology,"During its lysogenic life cycle, the phage genome integrates into the host chromosome by site-specific recombination. In this report, we analyze phage lambda integration at non-canonical sites using next-generation sequencing and show that it generates significant genetic diversity by targeting more than 300 unique sites in the Escherichia coli host genome. Furthermore, these integration events can have important phenotypic consequences for the host, including changes in cell motility and increased resistance to antibiotics. Importantly, the new technologies we developed to enable this study (sequencing of secondary sites by next-generation sequencing and then selection of relevant lysogens by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-based selection) are broadly applicable to other phages and bacteria. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bacteriophages play an important role in bacterial evolution through lysogeny, where the phage genome integrates into the host chromosome. While phage integration generally occurs at a specific site on the host chromosome, it is also known to occur at other so-called secondary sites. In this study, we developed a novel experimental technology to comprehensively study secondary integration sites and found that phage can integrate into more than 300 unique sites in the host genome, resulting in significant genetic diversity in bacteria. Furthermore, we developed an assay to examine the phenotypic consequence of such diverse integration events and found that phage integration can cause changes in evolutionarily relevant traits, such as bacterial motility and increased antibiotic resistance.

Persistent infection correlates with accelerated decline in lung function and early mortality. Horizontal DNA transfer by temperate bacteriophages can add genetic function and selective advantage to their bacterial host within the restricted environment of the lower lung. In this study, we chemically induced temperate bacteriophages from Pa clonal cultures and identified their mixed viral communities employing metagenomic approaches. We compared 92 temperate phage metagenomes stratified from this clinical background (47 CF and 45 nCFBR Pa isolates) using MG-RAST and GeneWise2. KEGG analysis shows that the complexity of temperate phage accessory gene transport increases with duration and severity of disease. Furthermore, we identified the presence of Ig-like motifs within phage structural genes linked to bacterial adhesion and carbohydrate binding, including Big_2, He_Pig, and Fn3. This study provides the first clinical support for the proposed model of bacteriophage-to-mucus adhesion (BAM) and the evolution of phages interacting on these mucosal surfaces over time.",,"Tariq, M.

2036,"Virology, serology and demographics of hepatitis E viremic blood donors in the south east of England","BACKGROUND Hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 (G3) in England comprises two main phylogenetic groups (Group 1 and Group 2) and can be transmitted by transfusion. Unselected screening identified 79 viremic donors; 76 participated in a follow-up study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The dynamics, phylogeny, and seroconversion of viral RNA in donors were characterized. Detailed demographic, travel, clinical, and lifestyle questionnaires were completed. RESULTS Most of the viremic individuals (57/79) were seronegative at the time of donation, but all seroconverted. Viremia was short-lived, with a median of 6.5 weeks to confirmed viral clearance. All infections were acquired in the UK and were G3, with group 2 viruses predominating (43/54; 80%). Infection was associated with some clinical symptoms both during and after donation (8/77; 10%). Viral loads and symptoms were more pronounced in Group 1 infections. There was no serological evidence of reinfection. Donors were more commonly male (p = 0.002); both male and female donors were older than comparison donors. Contact with animals is unlikely to be the source of infection. The consumption of chicken and pork meat was common to all infected donors; processed pork was most commonly purchased from a particular retail chain. CONCLUSION Viremic donors represent a primary infection in older members of the community and reflect a widespread zoonosis in the UK. The two phylogenetic groups of HEV G3 show different pathogenicity and the more common Group 2 appears less adapted to humans. There are no objective demographic criteria that can identify donors at increased risk of HEV.",,"Tedder, R. S.;Tettmar, K. I.;Brailsford, S.

2037,Increased prevalence of anellovirus in pediatric patients with fever,"The Anelloviridae family consists of circular, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses. Three genera of anelloviruses are known to infect humans, named TTV, TTMDV and TTMV. Although anelloviruses were initially thought to cause non-AG viral hepatitis, continuing research has shown no definitive associations between anelloviruses and human disease to date. Using high-throughput sequencing, we investigated the association between anelloviruses and fever in pediatric patients 2 to 36 months of age. We found that although anelloviruses were present in a large number of samples from febrile and afebrile patients, they were more frequent in plasma and nasopharyngeal (NP) samples from febrile patients compared to afebrile controls. Using PCR to detect each of the three anellovirus species that infect humans, we found that the TTV and TTMDV anellovirus species were more frequent in plasma and NP samples from febrile patients compared to afebrile controls. This was not the case for the TTMV species which was found in similar percentages of samples from febrile and afebrile patients. Analysis of patient age showed that the percentage of plasma and NP samples containing anellovirus increased with age until patients were between 19 and 24 months of age, after which the percentage of positive patient samples decreased. for anelloviruses. This trend was striking for TTV and TTMDV and very modest for TTMV in both plasma and NP samples. Finally, as the temperature of febrile patients increased, the detection frequency of TTV and TTMDV also increased. Once again, TTMV was equally present in samples from febrile and afebrile patients. Taken together, these data indicate that the human anellovirus species TTV and TTMDV are associated with fever in children, whereas the highly related human anellovirus TTMV is not associated with fever.",,"TeKippe, E.

2038,Viral metagenomics in animals as a tool for the detection of zoonoses prior to human infection?,"Many human viral infections have a zoonotic origin, that is, wild or domestic animals. Several zoonotic viruses are transmitted to humans directly through contact with an animal or indirectly through exposure to the urine or feces of infected animals or the bite of a bloodsucking arthropod. If a virus is able to adapt and replicate in its new human host, human-to-human transmissions can occur, possibly resulting in an epidemic, such as the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. Thus, predicting emerging zoonotic infections is an important factor. challenge for public health officials in the coming decades. The recent development of viral metagenomics, i.e. the characterization of the complete viral diversity isolated from an organism or environment using high-throughput sequencing technologies, holds promise for surveillance of such diseases and can be achieved by analyzing the virome of selected animals and arthropods that are in close contact with humans. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of viral diversity within such animals (particularly blood-feeding arthropods, wildlife, and domestic animals) using metagenomics and present its potential future application for disease surveillance. zoonotic and arboviral. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Temmam, S.;Davoust, B.;Berenger, J.

2039,Faustovirus-like asfarviruses in hematophagous biting mosquitoes and their vertebrate hosts,"Faustovirus, a new giant virus related to Asfarviridae, was recently isolated from Vermamoeba vermiformis, a protist found in sewage in various geographic locations and occasionally reported in human eye infections. As part of a global metagenomic analysis of existing viral communities in biting mosquitoes, we report here for the first time the identification and isolation of a Faustovirus-like virus in hematophagous arthropods and its detection in their animal hosts. Virome analysis of DNA from three groups of Culicoides sp., engorged female Culicoides imicola, and non-engorged male/female C. imicola biting midges collected in Senegal revealed the presence of giant amoebae-infecting viruses, including a majority of sequences related to Faustovirus. Phylogenetic analyzes performed on several Faustovirus structural genes confirmed the grouping of arthropod-borne Faustoviruses with sewage-borne Faustoviruses, with a distinct geographic clustering of Senegalese Faustovirus strains. Transmission electron microscopy identified viral particles with morphologies and diameters consistent with Faustovirus. The presence of arthropod-borne infectious Faustovirus was finally confirmed by successful isolation in the amoeba V. vermiformis. Global proteomic analysis of biting mosquitoes identified arthropod blood meal as originating from cattle, rodents, and humans. Additional screening of cattle sera and rodent tissue resulted in an estimated Faustovirus prevalence of 38% in rodents and 14% in cattle, suggesting a possible origin of Faustovirus presence in arthropods through ingestion of cornmeal. contaminated blood. Viral loads were highest in rodent kidney and urine samples, suggesting possible excretion of viral particles into the environment. Faustovirus DNA polymerase-related sequences were also detected in more than 9 and 11% of febrile patients and healthy Senegalese human sera, respectively. Our study, therefore, highlights the need to investigate the role of arthropods, wildlife, and domestic animals in the life cycle of giant viruses that infect amoebae, and in particular, the environmental cycle of Faustoviruses.",,"Temmam, S.;Monteil-Bouchard, S.;Sambou, M.;Aubadie-Ladrix, M.;Azza, S.;Decloquement, P.;Bou Khalil, J.

In this article, we report the isolation and characterization of Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) obtained from Eurasian collared pigeons during 2000-2001, and compare them with isolates obtained from feral pigeons (Columba livia) during the same period. . All isolates could be classified as avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV1) and belonged to the pigeon variant group (PPMV1), since their hemagglutinating activity was inhibited by the 161/617 mAb, which is specific for PPMV1. Intracerebral pathogenicity indices ranged from 0.68 to 1.38 and all isolates contained multiple basic amino acids at the inferred cleavage site of the fusion protein, which is a typical feature of virulent viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the isolates indicates that 18/20 of these form a separate group from the isolates obtained from pigeons in the same period. These findings suggest that different lineages circulate in feral pigeon populations and that a separate lineage affects Eurasian collared pigeons.",,"Terregino, C.;Cattoli, G.;Grossele, B.;Bertoli, E.;Tisato, E.;Capua, I.",2003.0,,10.1080/0307,0
2043,Heterologous viral expression systems in fosmid vectors increase the potential for functional analysis of metagenomic libraries,"The extraordinary potential of metagenomic functional analyzes to identify activities of interest present in uncultured microorganisms has been limited by the reduction of gene expression in surrogate hosts. We have developed specialized E. coli vectors and strains as improved heterologous metagenomic DNA expression systems, taking advantage of viral components that prevent transcription termination at metagenomic terminators. One of the systems uses RNA polymerase from phage T7 to drive metagenomic gene expression, while the other approach uses anti-transcriptional termination protein N from phage lambda to limit transcription termination. A metagenomic library was constructed and functionally screened to identify genes that confer carbenicillin resistance to E. coli. The use of these improved expression systems resulted in a 6-fold increase in the frequency of clones resistant to carbenicillin. Subcloning and sequence analysis showed that, in addition to β-lactamases, efflux pumps may not only contribute to carbenicillin resistance, but may in fact be sufficient on their own to transmit carbenicillin resistance. .",,"TerrÃ³n-GonzÃ¡lez, L.;Medina, C.;LimÃ³n-MortÃ©s, M.

2044,"Identification of a new aviadenovirus, named pigeon adenovirus 2 in domestic pigeons (Columba livia)","Young pigeon disease syndrome (YPDS) primarily affects young pigeons less than one year of age and causes crop stasis, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia and sometimes death. This disease is a major international health problem due to its seasonal appearance during competitions such as racing pigeons or ornamental bird shows. Although the etiology of YPDS remains unclear, adenoviruses are frequently discussed as possible causative agents. Electron microscopy of feces from an outbreak of YPDS revealed massive shedding of adenovirus-like particles. Whole genome sequencing of this sample identified a new adenovirus tentatively named pigeon adenovirus 2 (PiAdV-2). Phylogenetic and comparative genome analysis suggests that PiAdV-2 belongs to a new species within the genus Aviadenovirus, for which we propose the name Pigeon aviadenovirus B. The PiAdV-2 genome shares 54.9% nucleotide sequence identity. with pigeon adenovirus 1 (PiAdV-1). In a screen of other YPDS-affected flocks, two PiAdV-2 variants (variant A and B) were detected sharing 97.6% nucleotide identity of partial polymerase sequences, but only 79% nucleotide identity. .7% of the partial hexon sequences. The distribution of both PiAdV-2 variants was further investigated in fecal samples collected between 2008 and 2015 from healthy or YPDS-affected racing pigeons from different lofts. Regardless of health status, approximately 20% of young pigeon flocks and 13% of adult flocks harbored PiAdV-2 variants. Birds were free of PiAdV-1 or other aviadenoviruses as determined by PCR targeting the aviadenovirus polymerase or the PiAdV-1 fiber gene, respectively. In conclusion, there is no evidence of a correlation between YPDS outbreaks and the presence of PiAdV-2 or other aviadenoviruses, arguing against a causal role in this disease complex.",,"Teske, L.;Rubbenstroth, D.;Meixner, M.;Liere, K.;Bartels, H.;Rautenschlein, S.",2017.0,01 02,,0
2045,Characterization of a genetically heterogeneous porcine rotavirus C and other viruses present in the fecal virome of a non-diarrheic Belgian piglet,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are becoming more accessible, leading to increased interest in the composition of the porcine enteric virome. In the present study, the fecal virome of a non-diarrheic Belgian piglet was determined. Although the virome of only one piglet was analyzed, some interesting data were obtained, including the complete second genome of a porcine group C rotavirus (CVR). This Belgian strain was only distantly related to the only other fully characterized pig RVC strain, Cowden. Their relationship to RVC strains from other host species was also tested and the porcine strain found in our study was only distantly related to RVCs detected in humans and cows. The gene encoding the outer capsid protein VP7 belonged to the rare porcine G3 genotype, which could be serologically distinct from most other porcine RVC strains. A new putative RVC VP6 genotype was also identified. A strain of group A rotavirus also present in this fecal sample contained the rare combination of porcine genotypes G11P[27], but was only partially characterized. Typical pig RVA I5, A8 and T7 genotypes were found for the viral proteins VP6, NSP1 and NSP3, respectively. Interestingly, the piglet faecal virome also contained an astrovirus and an enterovirus, the complete genomes of which were characterized. The results of the current study indicate that many viruses may be simultaneously present in faecal samples from piglets without diarrhoea. In this study, these viruses could not be directly associated with any disease, but could still have had a potential subclinical impact on pig growth performance. The rapid evolution of NGS will be a powerful tool for future diagnostics in veterinary practice. Its application will certainly lead to a better understanding of the relevance of many (sub)clinical enteric viral infections, which may have been missed using traditional diagnostic techniques.

Here the capabilities of nanopore sequencing for viral diagnosis were investigated. First, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and rotavirus A grown in cell culture were pooled and sequenced on a MinION. Reads were already detected as early as 7 seconds after the start of sequencing, resulting in a high sequencing depth (19.2 to 103.5X) after 3 h. Diarrheic faeces from a one-week-old piglet were then analysed. Nearly all reads (99%) belonged to bacteriophages, which may have remodeled the piglet's microbiome. The contigs matched the phages of Bacteroides, Escherichia and Enterococcus. Furthermore, porcine kobuvirus was discovered in faeces for the first time in Belgium. Suckling piglets excrete kobuvirus from one week of age, but no association was observed between peak viral shedding (10<sup>6.42</sup>-10<sup>7.01</sup> copies/swab) and diarrheal signs for one week. Follow-up study. Retrospective analysis showed widespread (n = 25, 56.8% positive) moderately genetically related kobuviruses among Belgian piglets with diarrhea.

2047,Molecular characterization of positive-stranded RNA viruses: pestivirus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV),"Molecular characterization has become an important tool for virus analysis including classification. The manuscript focuses on the molecular analysis of two members of the pestivirus genus (hog cholera virus, HCV, and bovine viral diarrhea virus, BVDV) and the recently discovered porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The first protein encoded within the single large ORF of pestiviruses is a nonstructural protein with autoproteolytic activity. The cleavage site between the protease and p14 capsid protein has been previously predicted, but recent experimental data indicate that processing occurs at a different site. The capsid protein is followed by a putative internal signal sequence and three glycoproteins that are part of the virion envelope. According to a new proposal for the nomenclature of the structural proteins of pestiviruses, they are named C, E0, E1 and E2. The genomes of BVDV pairs isolated from animals suffering from mucosal disease were analyzed. The genomes of cytopathogenic BVD viruses (cp) may contain insertions highly homologous to cellular sequences. Furthermore, BVDV cp may differ from its non-cytopathogenic (non-cp) counterpart by mere rearrangement of viral sequences. PRRS disease, which emerged a few years ago, is caused by a single-stranded RNA virus; the viral genome is of positive polarity and is 15 kb in size. Data regarding morphology, morphogenesis, and virion composition suggested that PRRSV belongs to a group of so-called arteriviruses that includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). This conclusion has now been confirmed by analysis of genome organization, gene expression strategy, and comparison of deduced protein sequences.",,"Thiel, H.

High seroprevalences of HEV can be found in European pig populations. The aims of this study were to obtain prevalence data for HEV infection in pigs in Belgium and to phylogenetically compare Belgian human HEV sequences with those obtained from pigs. An ELISA screening prevalence of 73% (95% CI 68.8-77.5) was determined in Belgian pigs and part of the results were re-evaluated by Western blot (WB). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed and scenarios were analyzed that vary the specificity of ELISA relative to WB. The seroprevalences estimated by the different scenarios ranged between 69 and 81% and are in agreement with the high exposure of the European pig population to HEV. Pig HEV sequences were genetically compared with those detected in humans in Belgium and showed a predominance of subtype f of genotype 3 in both pigs and humans. The high seroprevalence of HEV in pigs and the close phylogenetic relationships between porcine and human HEV sequences further support the risk of zoonotic transmission of HEV between humans and pigs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,"Thiry, D.;Mauroy, A.;Saegerman, C.;Thomas, I.;Wautier, M.;Miry, C.;Czaplicki, G.;Berkvens, D.;Praet, N.;van der Poel, W.;Cariolet, R.;Brochier, B.;Thiry, E.",2014.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.06.004,0
2050,Molecular biology of bovine herpesvirus type 4,"Bovine herpesvirus type 4 (BHV-4) is a ubiquitous virus of cattle. Its genome is a double-stranded DNA of 144 ± 6 kb consisting of a single central part (L-DNA) flanked at both ends by tandem repeats called polyrepetitive DNA (prDNA or H-DNA). The general arrangement of genes has been obtained by analyzing homologies between short DNA sequences of BHV-4 and the corresponding genes of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and herpesvirus saimiri (HVS). Gene expression is temporally regulated. The p-glycoprotein precursor (gp10/gp17) is expressed as gamma 1 polypeptide. Glycoproteins gp1, gp8, gp11 and their precursors are gamma 2 proteins. Analysis of strain variations allows the definition of two types of strains, based on in DNA patterns: Movar 33/63-like and DN 599-like strains. Only strain M40, isolated in India, does not fit this classification. Genomic variations were compiled to construct a dendrogram showing three levels of divergence between BHV-4 strains or isolates. Available molecular data indicate that the BHV-4 genome shares a high similarity with the DNA of EBV and HVS, two representative members of the gammaherpesvirinae.

2051,The origin of lentivirus research: the Maedi-visna virus,"Maedi and visna are contagious sheep diseases that were introduced to Iceland in 1933 by imported sheep of the Karakul breed. Maedi, a slowly progressing pneumonia, and the central nervous system disease visna have been shown to be transmissible in sheep and most likely caused by a virus. In 1957, visna virus was isolated in sheep brain tissue culture, and maedi virus was isolated the following year from sheep lungs. Both viruses showed a similar cytopathic effect in tissue culture. Electron microscopy studies of ultrathin sections of visna virus-infected cells demonstrated spherical particles, 70–100 nm in diameter, that were formed by budding from the cell membrane. Later studies showed identical particles in cultures infected with the maedi virus. These and several other comparative studies clearly indicated that maedi and visna were caused by strains of the same virus, later called maedi-visna virus (MVV). Comparative studies in tissue culture suggested that MVV was related to the animal RNA tumor viruses, the oncornaviruses. This was later supported by the finding that MVV is an RNA virus. A few months after reverse transcriptase was demonstrated in oncornaviruses, the enzyme was also found in MVV virions. Therefore, MVV was classified as a retrovirus along with the oncornaviruses. However, MVV is not oncogenic in vivo or in vitro and in 1975 was placed in a subgroup of retroviruses called lentiviruses, which cause a cytopathic effect in vitro and a slowly progressive inflammatory disease in animals, but are not oncogenic. In the early 1980s, the causative agent of AIDS was discovered to be a non-oncogenic retrovirus and was classified as a lentivirus. Thus, HIV became the first human lentivirus. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.",,"Thormar, H.",2013.0,,,0
2052,"Prevalence and diversity of avian influenza H9N2 in chickens from northern Vietnam, 2014","Despite their classification as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV), A/H9N2 viruses cause significant losses in poultry in many countries in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. To date, poultry surveillance in Vietnam has focused on detection of H5 influenza viruses and there is limited understanding of the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of H9 influenza. We determined the prevalence and diversity of influenza A viruses in chickens from live bird markets (LBM) from 7 provinces in northern Vietnam, using pooled oropharyngeal samples collected between October and December 2014. Detection by time-lapse RT-PCR actual revealed 1207/4900 (24.6%) of swabs pooled to be positive for influenza A virus; overall prevalence estimates after accounting for pooling (5 swabs/pools) were 5.8% (CI 5.4-6.0). Subtyping was performed on 468 pooled swabs with the M Ct<26 gene. Influenza H7 was not detected; 422 (90.1%) were H9 positive; and 22 (4.7%) were H5 positive. There was no evidence of interaction between H9 and H5 virus detection rates. We sequenced 17 complete genomes of A/H9N2, 2 of A/H5N6 and 11 partial genomes. All of the H9N2 viruses had internal genes that clustered with genotype 57 and were closely related to Chinese human isolates of A/H7N9 and A/H10N8. Using a 98% nucleotide divergence limit, we identified 9 distinct H9 genotypes.

These BVDVs included a thrombocytopenic strain from the United States, a fetal bovine serum contaminant, a strain from western Canada, and two highly virulent strains, which cause high mortality rates, from Quebec. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of these E2s had only 60-65% homology to the E2s of group I BVDV, but >90% homology to the E2 of a subgroup of sheep border disease viruses. The E2 gene of the NADL strain was expressed and monospecific antibodies were generated in calves and rabbits. The virus-neutralizing titers of these antisera were 15- to 80-fold lower for the heterologous BVDV group compared to those for the homologous BVDV.",,"Tijssen, P.;Pellerln, C.;Lecomte, J.;Van Den Hurk, J.",1996.0,,10.1006/viro.1996.0123,0

2058,High-throughput sequencing of targeted 16S rRNA to characterize microbial communities during composting of dead animals,"Objective A comprehensive understanding of the microbial community is necessary to ensure a significant reduction in pathogens during the composting process. Methods and results Two biosecure static composting systems containing dead animals were built at subzero temperatures. Temperature at each sampling site was measured continuously and samples were grouped as either <= 50 or >= 55 degrees C, based on temperature exposure required for effective pathogen inactivation during composting. High-throughput 454 sequencing was used to characterize the bacterial communities within each sample. Grouping of bacterial communities according to temperature was observed. However, neither richness nor diversity differed between temperature groups. Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum within both temperature groups, but was more pronounced (63 center point 6%) in samples >= 55 degrees C (P<0 center point 05). Similarly, members of Clostridia, Clostridium sensu stricto (central 3 points 64%), Clostridium XI (central 0 points 59%), UF (Clostridiaceae 1) (central 5 points 29%), and UF (Clostridiales Incertae Sedis XI) (6 center points 20%), were prominent at >= 55 degrees C (P<0 center point 05), likely a reflection of spore survival and/or anaerobic microenvironments within passively aerated compost piles. Members of Thermobifida (3 center points 54%), UO (Actinomycetales) (12 center points 29%), and UO (Bacillales) (19 center points 49%) were also prominent at >= 55 degrees C (P<0 center point 05). Conclusion There is substantial spatial diversity within bacterial communities in field-scale compost piles. Localized temperature at the sampling site may be one of the contributing factors to this phenomenon. Significance and impact of the study This is the first study to describe microbial community profiling using targeted 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing in passively aerated composted cattle kills.",,"Tkachuk, V.

2059,A broad repertoire of type III secretory effectors in Escherichia coli O157 and the role of lambdoid phages in their dissemination,"Several pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli take advantage of type III secretion to inject ""effector proteins"" into human cells, which then subvert the biology of eukaryotic cells to the benefit of the bacterium. We have taken advantage of bioinformatics and experimental approaches to establish that the effector repertoire in the Sakai strain of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is much larger than previously thought. Homology searches led to the identification of more than 60 putative effector genes. Thirteen of these were considered likely pseudogenes, while 49 were considered potentially functional. In total, 39 proteins were experimentally confirmed as effectors: 31 by proteomics and 28 by translocation assays. At the protein level, EHEC effector sequences fall into >20 families. The largest family, the NIeG family, contains 14 members in the Sakai strain alone. EHEC also harbors functional homologues of plant pathogen (HopPtoH, HopW, AvrA) and Shigella (OspD, OspE, OspG) effectors and two additional members of the Map/IpgB family. Genes encoding proven or predicted effectors are found at >20 interchangeable effector loci scattered throughout the chromosome. Crucially, most functional effector genes are encoded by nine interchangeable effector loci found within lambdoid prophages. Thus, type III secretion in E. coli is linked to a vast phage ""metagenome"", which acts as a crucible for the evolution of pathogenicity. © 2006 by the US National Academy of Sciences.",,"Tobe, T.;Beatson, S.

2061,Circovirus: immunosuppressive threats to avian species: a review,"Circoviruses are small non-enveloped icosahedral viruses that are unique among animal viruses in having circular genomes of single-stranded DNA. Their genomes are also the smallest of animal viruses. The circovirus family currently comprises three members, avian anemia virus, porcine circovirus, and Psittacine beak and feather disease virus, with pigeon circovirus being classified as a provisional member. Infections with each of the four circoviruses are associated with life-threatening diseases in which virus-induced damage to lymphoid tissue and immunosuppression are common features. Experience with other families of animal viruses suggests that additional animal species will be infected by, as yet undiscovered, circoviruses, and that these may show similar tissue tropism and disease-causing potential. Recent reports describing the association of circovirus-like viruses with immunodeficiency-related diseases of geese and southern black-backed gulls suggest that circovirus infections of avian species may be more common than previously believed. and raise the question of whether the new circoviruses infect poultry to cause clinical and/or subclinical diseases that may be economically important. This review has three purposes. First, it is designed to summarize currently available information on classified circoviruses and viruses that are considered to be similar to circoviruses. Second, it is intended to alert readers to the possibility that other bird species, including commercial poultry, may be infected with new circoviruses. Finally, possible methods to discover new circoviruses and to control infections by said viruses are suggested.",,"Todd, D.",2000.0,Oct,,0
2062,Morphogenesis of a cytomegalovirus from an American bison affected by malignant catarrhal fever,"herpesvirus isolated from various organs of an American bison affected with malignant catarrhal fever was cultured in fetal bovine spleen cells and studied by electron microscopy. The fine structural features of the mature virion and the mode of virus morphogenesis were found to be similar to herpesviruses classified in the cytomegalovirus subgroup. The capsids were granular, hexagonal in shape and contained pleomorphic nuclei in thin sections. Capsid engulfment occurred primarily by budding at cytoplasmic membranes that appeared to be formed as extended Golgi vesicles; Budding was rarely observed at the nuclear membranes. Cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of granular threads and electron-dense amorphous material were found in association with virions during the later stages of infection. The formation of cytoplasmic inclusions, the morphogenesis, and the ultrastructure of the virus are consistent with the classification of this virus as cytomegalovirus.",,"Todd, W.

Objectives: To genotype VZV strains in Australia using high-resolution fusion (HRM) analysis of SNPs in five genetic targets. Study Design: DNA extracted from 78 samples obtained from patients with varicella and zoster were genotyped by HRM analysis of SNPs in five open reading frames (ORFs): 1 (685 G > A), 21 (33,725 C > T) , 37 (66,288 G>A), 60 (101,464 C>A), and 62 (106,262 T>C) using a double-stranded (ds) DNA saturating dye, LC Green Plus. Results: For each genotype, changes in melting curve temperature (Tm) differentiated the nucleotide present at that locus (P < 0.0001) with changes in melting curve between alleles ranging from 0.56 °C (ORF 37) at 3.34°C (ORF 62). The most common genotypes detected were European type C (59%) and B (18%) strains. It was followed by African/Asian type A (14%) and Japanese J1 (9%) strains, both prevalent in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Conclusions: HRM analysis of SNPs showed that European genotypes B and C were the most prevalent in Australia, with strains of genotypes A and J also present.

IBDV (Avibirnavirus, Birnaviridae) is a non-enveloped virus with a bisegmented double-stranded RNA genome. The virus is traditionally classified into classical, variant, and highly virulent strains, each with different epidemiological relevance and clinical implications. Recently, a new genetic lineage spread throughout the world was described and denoted as distinct (d)IBDV. Here, we report on the development and validation of a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay for the specific detection of dIBDV in the global poultry industry. The assay employs a TaqMan-MGB probe that hybridizes with a unique molecular signature of dIBDV. The assay successfully detected all tested strains belonging to the dIBDV genetic lineage, showing high specificity and no cross-reactivity with non-dIBDV, IBDV-negative samples, and other common avian viruses. Using serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed RNA, we obtained acceptable PCR efficiencies and coefficients of determination, and relatively small intra- and inter-assay variability.

The histopathological characteristics of the lesions were consistent with this diagnosis. Orf virus DNA, phylogenetically similar to an isolate from a captive muskox from the Minnesota Zoo, USA, was detected in lesions by PCR using Parapoxvirus primers. In addition, there was a metaphyseal abscess with a cortical fistula in the right metacarpus from which Brucella suis biovar 4 was isolated and identification by PCR was supported. Brucella spp. antibodies were detected in serum. Finally, 212 nodules were dissected from the lungs. Fecal analysis and lung examination demonstrated co-infection with the lungworms Umingmakstrongylus pallikuukensis and Varestrongylus eleguneniensis. The zoonotic potential of orf and rangiferine brucellosis adds an important public health dimension to this case, particularly given that muskox are a valuable food source for Arctic residents. Careful examination of these pathogens at the population level is needed as they may contribute to muskox population declines and potentially constitute a factor of food insecurity for local communities.

All viruses caused Pacheco's disease, and the serotypes of the European isolates were known. A phylogenetic tree derived from these sequences showed that the PsHVs that cause Pacheco's disease comprised four major genotypes, with each genotype including two to four variants. With the exception of two viruses, the serotypes of the isolated viruses could be predicted from the genotypes. Genotypes 1 and 4 corresponded to serotype 1 isolates, genotype 2 corresponded to serotype 2 isolates, and genotype 3 corresponded to serotype 3 isolates. The single serotype 4 virus was assigned to genotype 4. DNA from a virus with a single serotype could not be amplified with primers that amplified the DNA of all other PsHVs, and its classification remains unknown. Viruses representing all four genotypes were found in both the United States and Europe, and therefore serotypes 1, 2, and 3 were predicted to be present in the United States. Serotype 4 was represented by a single European isolate that could not be genetically distinguished from serotype 1 viruses; therefore, the presence of serotype 4 in the United States could not be predicted. Genotype 4 viruses were found to be most commonly associated with Pacheco's disease in macaws and parrots and are less likely to be isolated from fibroblasts of chicken embryos in the United States. All four genotypes caused deaths in Amazon parrots, but genotype 4 was associated with Pacheco's disease only in Amazon parrots in Europe.

A great diversity in virulence is also found, with strains covering the full spectrum from avirulent to highly virulent. The underlying genetic determinants are far from understood. Since the RNA polymerases of RNA viruses lack proofreading activity, different genome variations called haplotypes are produced during replication. A set of haplotypes is called a viral quasispecies. Genetic variability may be a fitness advantage by facilitating more effective escape from host immune responses. In order to investigate the correlation of quasispecies composition and virulence in vivo, we analyzed next-generation sequencing data of CSFV isolates of variable virulence.

Sequence analysis of the HA region containing the cleavage site of the isolates showed a similar sequence motif (PARSSRG) but different framework regions. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that the isolates were closely related to those previously isolated, indicating a common source. Furthermore, the amino acid sequences of recent isolates were very similar to those from Saudi Arabia, Germany, and Pakistan. It is postulated that, except for some Chinese isolates, the pathogenicity of the Iranian isolates appears to be similar to that of other Eurasian isolates. It is possible that an elevation in the mortality rate under field conditions may be caused by coinfection of recent isolates with bacteria such as mycoplasma, Escherichia coli, and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale rather than an emerging pathogenic H9N2 subtype of the virus.",,"Toroghi, R.;Momayez, R.",2006.0,,,0
2078,Emergence of amantadine-resistant H5N1 avian influenza virus in India,"This study reports on the genetic characterization of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (subtype H5N1) isolated from poultry in West Bengal, India. We analyzed all eight genome segments of two viruses isolated from chickens in January 2010 to understand their genetic relationship to other Indian H5N1 isolates and the possible connection between different outbreaks. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the viruses showed multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site, a marker of high virulence in chickens. Of greatest concern was that the viruses showed amino acid substitution from serine to asparagine at position 31 of the M2 ion channel protein, suggesting the emergence of amantadine-resistant mutants that had not been previously reported in HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in India. The amino acid lysine at position 627 of the PB2 protein highlights the risk posed by viruses to mammals. In phylogenetic trees, viruses clustered within the lineage of avian isolates from India (2008-2009) and avian and human isolates from Bangladesh (2007-2009) across all genes. Both viruses were most closely related to the 2008 West Bengal viruses within the 2.2.3 subclade of H5N1 viruses. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.",,"Tosh, C.;Murugkar, H.

2079,First genetic characterization of Peste des Petits Rumiants from Niger: at the forefront of advancement of the Asian virus lineage,"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a serious transboundary infectious disease of small ruminants. The causative agent, PPR virus (PPRV), can be separated into four genetically distinct lineages by phylogenetic analysis. In recent decades, PPRV lineage IV has dramatically extended its geographic distribution from Asia to the Middle East and Africa, where it has progressively replaced other PPRV lineages. Lineages I and II are historically distributed in West Africa. Currently, lineage II appears to dominate the region, while the last recorded occurrence of lineage I dates back to 1994. Recent studies reported the presence of lineage IV in Nigeria, suggesting that this lineage is expanding in West Africa. In Niger, a close neighbor of Nigeria, PPRV has never been genetically characterized, despite reports of PPR incidence. In this study, pathological samples collected from sick goats in 2013 during a suspected PPR outbreak in southern Niger near the Nigerian border were compared with samples collected in a previous investigation in October 2001 in southwestern Niger. These strains were characterized by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to identify their genetic lineage. Our results show that in 2001, lineages I and II were co-circulating in southwestern Niger, while the strain that caused the outbreak in 2013 belonged to lineage IV and is closely related to strains identified in Nigeria. These results confirm lineage IV progression in West Africa. The process of PPRV lineage replacement and its implications for epidemiology and disease control in this region are unclear and should be the subject of further study in the field.",,"Tounkara, K.;Bataille, A.;Adombi, C.

2080,Genetic and biological characterization of an avian type H1N2 swine influenza virus generated by recomposition of circulating avian type H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in Denmark,"Background: Influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are the most prevalent subtypes in pigs. In 2003, a mixed subtype of swine influenza virus (SIV) H1N2 emerged and became prevalent in Denmark. In the present study, the reassortant H1N2 subtype was genetically characterized and infection dynamics compared with a ""bird-like"" H1N1 virus using an experimental infection study. Methods. Sequence analyzes of the H1N2 virus were performed. Two groups of pigs were inoculated with the reassortant H1N2 virus and a ""bird-like"" H1N1 virus, respectively, followed by inoculation with the opposite subtype four weeks later. Measurements of HI antibodies and acute phase proteins were performed. Nasal virus excretion and virus load in the lungs were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the reassortant H1N2 virus contained a European ""bird-like"" H1 gene and a European ""pig-like"" N2 gene, making it genetically distinct from most H1N2 viruses circulating in the world. Europe, but similar to viruses reported in 2009/2010 in Sweden and Italy. Sequence analyzes of the internal genes revealed that the rearrangement likely arose between the ""bird-like"" Danish H1N1 and H3N2 SIVs. Infected pigs developed cross-reactive antibodies and increased levels of acute phase proteins after inoculations. H1N2-inoculated pigs exhibited nasal shedding of virus for seven days, peaking on day 1 post-inoculation, two days earlier than H1N1-infected pigs and at a six-fold higher level. The difference, however, was not statistically significant. Pigs slaughtered on day 4 post-inoculation had a high virus load in all lung lobes. After the second inoculation, nasal shedding of virus was minimal. There were no clinical signs except elevated body temperature under the experimental conditions. Conclusions: The ""avian-like"" H1N2 subtype, which has been established in the Danish pig population since at least 2003, is a rearrangement between circulating ""avian-like"" H1N1 and circulating porcine H3N2. Danish H1N2 has a ""bird-like"" H1 and differs from most other H1N2 viruses reported in Europe and North America/Asia, which have H1 genes of human or ""classical pig"" origin, respectively. However, the variant seems to be circulating in countries like Sweden and Italy as well. The infection dynamics of the rearranged ""bird-like"" H1N2 is similar to the older ""bird-like"" H1N1 subtype. © 2013 Trebbien et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Trebbien, R.;Bragstad, K.;Larsen, L.

2081,Neuropathological study reveals underestimation of the prevalence of neuroinfectious diseases in cattle in Switzerland,"Neuroinfectious diseases in cattle represent a serious threat to animal health, but their prevalence is not well documented and the etiology of the disease often remains unidentified. The objectives of this study were to generate baseline data on the prevalence of neuroinfectious diseases in cattle in Switzerland by means of a neuropathological survey and to identify disease-associated pathogens. The survey was conducted over a 1-year period using a representative number of brainstem samples (n = 1,816) from downed cattle. In total, 4% (n = 73) of the animals presented significant lesions, the most frequent types being indicative of viral (n = 27) and bacterial (n = 31) aetiology. Follow-up diagnoses by immunohistochemistry, PCR protocols, and state-of-the-art sequencing identified infection by Listeria monocytogenes (n = 6), ovine herpesvirus 2 (n = 7), bovine astrovirus CH13 (n = 2), bovine herpesvirus 6 (n = 6 ), bovine retrovirus CH15 (n = 2), posavirus 1 (n = 2), and porcine astrovirus (n = 2). A retrospective investigation based on a questionnaire indicated that the owners of the animals observed clinical signs of neurological disease in about one third of the cases with lesions, which was estimated to correspond to approximately 85 cases per year in the adult bovine population fallen in Swiss. This estimate contrasts sharply with the number of cases reported to authorities and reveals a gap in disease surveillance. Routine neuropathological examination and follow-up molecular testing of cattle with neurological diseases could significantly improve the efficiency of disease detection in order to estimate the prevalence of endemic diseases, identify new or re-emerging pathogens, and provide ""early warning"" of disease outbreaks. diseases.",,"Truchet, L.;Walland, J.;Wuthrich, D.;Boujon, C.

2082,High-throughput sequencing reveals different immune responses in the intestinal mucosa of two inbred lines affected by necrotic enteritis,"We investigated necrotic enteritis (NE)-induced transcripts of immune-related genes in the intestinal mucosa of two highly inbred White Leghorn chicken lines, line 6.3 and line 7.2, which share the same MHC haplotype and show different levels of . susceptibility to NE using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology. NE was induced by the previously described coinfection model using Eimeria maxima and Clostridium perfringens. RNA-Seq generated more than 38 million sequence reads for the Marek's disease (MD)-resistant line 6.3 and more than 40 million reads for the MD-susceptible line 7.2. Alignment of these sequences with the Gallus gallus genome database revealed the expression of more than 29,900 NE-induced gene transcripts in these two lines, among which 7,841 genes were significantly up-regulated and 2,919 genes were down-regulated. chicken line 6.3 downregulated and 6043 genes were significantly upregulated and 2764 genes were downregulated in NE-induced line 7.2 compared to their uninfected controls. Analysis of 560 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the Gene Ontology Database revealed annotations for 246 biological processes, 215 molecular functions, and 81 cellular components. Among the 53 cytokines and 96 cytokine receptors, 15 cytokines and 29 cytokine receptors were highly expressed in line 6.3, while the expression of 15 cytokines and 15 cytokine receptors was higher in line 7.2 than in line 6.3 (fold change >= 2, p< 0.01). In a hierarchical cluster analysis of novel mRNAs, the novel mRNA transcriptome showed higher expression in line 6.3 than in line 7.2, which is consistent with the expression profile of immune-related target genes. In qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq analysis, all genes examined showed similar responses to NE (correlation coefficient R = 0.85-0.89, p < 0.01) in both lines 6.3 and 7.2. This study is the first report describing NE-induced DEGs and novel transcriptomes using RNA-seq data from two inbred chicken lines showing different levels of susceptibility to NE.

2086,There is nothing permanent except change. The emergence of new viral diseases.,"The sudden appearance of apparently new viruses with pathogenic potential is of fundamental importance in medical microbiology and a constant threat to humans and animals. The appearance of a 'new' pathogen is not an isolated event, as shown, for example, by the frequent appearance of new strains of the influenza virus. New virus strains often co-circulate with older strains in a susceptible population, but replacement of older strains has also been observed. On rare occasions, new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such as those seen with human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus, or, more recently, the bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent in the United Kingdom. The mechanisms of emergence are not always clearly understood, but altered host range appears to be a common event. It is often unknown whether a true host range shift occurred or whether the virus adapted to the host and replicated more efficiently. This review attempts to summarize the facts that are known about a wide variety of 'new' mammalian viruses, such as simian, human and feline lentiviruses, feline coronaviruses, feline parvoviruses, carnivore morbilliviruses, influenza A viruses and Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Special emphasis will be placed on the genetic mechanisms that could have taken place and that could have been responsible for its sudden appearance.",,"Truyen, U.;Parrish, C. R.;Harder, T.

2087,Molecular epidemiological studies on Taiwan type O foot-and-mouth disease viruses from the 1997 epidemic,"The sequence diversity of the entire VP1 gene amplified directly from 49 clinical samples during an outbreak of explosive foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Taiwan was evaluated. Type O Taiwan FMD viruses are genetically highly homogeneous, as seen by the minute divergence of 0.2-0.9% revealed in 20 variants. The viral variants O/HCP-0314/TW/97 and O/TCP-022/TW/97 dominated FMD outbreaks and were prevalent in most of the affected pig-raising areas. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences around the major neutralizable antigenic sites in the VP1 polypeptide did not show significant antigenic variation. However, the O/CHP-158/TW/97 variant had an alternative critical residue at position 43 in antigenic site 3, which may be due to selection pressure in the field. Two vaccine production strains (O1/Manisa/Turkey/69 and O1/Campos/Brazil/71) probably provide partial heterologous protection of pigs against Taiwan O viruses. Taiwanese O-type variants were grouped into sublineage A1 from four major lineages in the phylogenetic tree. The O/Hong Kong/9/94 and O/1685/Moscow/Russia/95 viruses in the A2 sublineage are closely related to the O Taiwan variants. The causative agent of the 1997 epidemic presumably originated from a single common source of type O FMD virus that is prevalent in neighboring areas.

2089,Occurrence of a Formosan ferret badger-associated enzootic sylvatic rabies in Taiwan and the geographic separation of two phylogenetic groups of rabies viruses,"Taiwan had been declared free of rabies in humans and domestic animals for five decades until July 2013, when, shockingly, three Formosan ferret badgers (FB) were diagnosed with rabies. Since then, a variety of wild carnivores and other wildlife species have been found dead, neurologically ill or exhibiting aggressive behavior around the island. To determine the animal species, geographic areas, and environments affected, animal bodies were examined for rabies using direct fluorescent antibody testing (FAT). Viral genomes from the brains of selected rabid animals were sequenced for the phylogeny of rabies viruses (RABVs). Of a total of 1016 wild carnivores, 276/831 (33.2%) Formosan FB were FAT positive, with occasional incidents of bites in 1 dog and suspected infection in 1 domestic shrew. All other animals tested, including dogs, cats, bats, mice, house shrews, and squirrels, were negative for rabies. Rabies was associated with badgers and was limited to nine counties/cities in jungle environments. Phylogeny of the nucleoprotein and glycoprotein genes of 59 RABVs associated with Formosan FB revealed that they were clustered into two distinct groups, TWI and TWII, consistent with the geographic segregation into western and eastern Taiwan provided by the Cordillera Central and in the north free and free of rabies. south-central regions affected by rabies over a river dividing western Taiwan.

2090,An evolutionarily young polar bear (Ursus maritimus) endogenous retrovirus identified from next-generation sequence data,"Transcriptomic analysis of polar bear (Ursus maritimus) tissues identified sequences with similarity to porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV). On the basis of these sequences, four proviral copies and 15 individual long terminal repeats (LTRs) of a newly described endogenous retrovirus were characterized from the polar bear draft genome sequence. Closely related sequences were identified by PCR analysis from brown bear (Ursus arctos) and black bear (Ursus americanus), but were absent from bear species other than Ursinae. Therefore, the virus was named UrsusERV. Two distinct groups of LTRs were observed, including one recombinant ERV containing one LTR belonging to each group, indicating that genomic invasions by at least two UrsusERV variants have recently occurred. Age estimates based on proviral LTR divergence and conservation of integration sites among ursids suggest that the viral group is only a few million years old. The younger provirus was polar bear-specific, had intact open reading frames (ORFs), and could encode functional proteins. Phylogenetic analyzes of UrsusERV consensus protein sequences suggest that it is part of a clade of pig, gibbon, and koala retroviruses. Estimates of the young age and lineage specificity of the virus suggest that UrsusERV is a recent interspecies transmission from an unknown reservoir and places the viral group among the youngest ERVs identified in mammals.",,"Tsangaras, K.;Mayer, J.;Alquezar-Planas, D.

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology provides millions or even billions of sequence reads per run, allowing a complete study of the genetic content within a sample without prior nucleic acid amplification. In this study, we analyzed 156 rectal swab samples from apparently healthy bats (n = 96), pigs (n = 9), cattle (n = 9), stray dogs (n = 11), stray cats (n = 11), and monkeys (n = 20) using an HTS metagenomics approach. The complete genome of a new papillomavirus (PV), Miniopterus schreibersii papillomavirus type 1 (MscPV1), with L1 of 60% nucleotide identity to canine papillomavirus (CPV6), was identified in a sample from a common bat. folded-winged (M. schreibersii). It is about 7.5 kb long, with a G+C content of 45.8%, and a genomic organization similar to that of other PVs. Despite the greater nucleotide identity between the genomes of MscPV1 and CPV6, maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene sequence showed that MscPV1 and Erethizon dorsatum papillomavirus (EdPV1) are more closely related. The estimated divergence time of MscPV1 from the common ancestor EdPV1/MscPV1 was approximately 60.2-91.9 million years ago, inferred under strict clocks using the L1 and E1 genes. Estimates were limited by the lack of reliable calibration points for co-divergence due to potential host switching. Since the nucleotide sequence of this virus showed only limited similarity to that of related animal PVs, the conventional PCR approach using consensus primers is unlikely to have detected the new virus in the sample. Unlike the first bat papillomavirus RaPV1, MscPV1 was found in an asymptomatic bat with no apparent mucosal or skin lesions, whereas RaPV1 was detected in basosquamous carcinoma from a fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus.

2093,A new mechanism of activation of the H9N2 avian influenza virus by furin,"The H9N2 avian influenza virus is prevalent in waterfowl and has become endemic in poultry in Asia and the Middle East. H9N2 influenza viruses have served as an internal gene reservoir for other avian influenza viruses that infect humans, and several cases of human infection with H9N2 influenza viruses have indicated their pandemic potential. Fortunately, an extensive surveillance program allows close monitoring of H9N2 influenza viruses worldwide and has generated a large repository of virus sequence and phylogenetic information. Despite the large number of sequences in different databases, very little is known about specific virus isolates and their pathogenesis. Here, we characterize a low pathogenicity avian influenza virus, A/chicken/Israel/810/2001 (H9N2) (Israel810), that is representative of influenza virus strains that have caused severe morbidity and mortality on farms. poultry. We show that, under certain circumstances, Israel810 hemagglutinin (HA) can be activated by furin, a hallmark of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. We show that Israel810 HA can divide in cells with high levels of furin expression and that a mutation that eliminates a glycosylation site in HA1 allows Israel810 HA to obtain universal division in cell culture. Pseudoparticles generated from Israel810 HA, or the glycosylation mutant, efficiently transduce cells. In contrast, the introduction of a polybasic cleavage site in Israel810 HA leads to pseudoviruses that are transduction-compromised. Our data indicate a mechanism for an H9N2 evolutionary pathway that may allow it to gain virulence in a different way than H5 and H7 influenza viruses. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Tse, L.

In cattle, BPV-1/2 is associated with urinary bladder cancer and BPV-4 with cancer of the upper GI tract. BPV E5 is a small hydrophobic protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (GA). E5 is the main BPV transforming protein, capable of inducing cell transformation in cultured mouse fibroblasts and, in cooperation with E7, in primary bovine cells. E5-induced cell transformation is accompanied by activation of several cellular protein kinases, including growth factor receptors, and alkalinization of endosomes and GA. We have reported that BPV E5 causes swelling and fragmentation of the GA and extensive vacuolization of the cytoplasm. We now show that E5 of BPV-1 and BPV-4 perturbs the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions in transformed bovine cells, where these morphological and behavioral features are accompanied by hyperphosphorylation of the cellular phosphotyrosine kinase c-src. Both BPV-1 and BPV-4 E5 increase the motility of transformed mouse cells, but only BPV-1 E5 causes transformed mouse cells to penetrate a matrigel matrix.

2095,Dynamics of envelope evolution in clade C SHIV-infected pigtail macaques during disease progression analyzed by ultra-deep pyrosequencing,"Understanding the evolution of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope during disease progression may provide insights for vaccine development, and simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection ) from non-human primates provides an ideal platform for such studies. A recently developed clade C SHIV, SHIV-1157ipd3N4, which was capable of infecting rhesus macaques, closely resembled primary HIV-1 in transmission and pathogenesis, was used to infect several pig-tailed macaques. One of the infected animals subsequently progressed to AIDS, while one remained without progression. The evolution of the viral envelope in the infected animals during disease progression was analyzed by a bioinformatic approach using ultra-deep pyrosequencing. Our results showed substantial variations of the envelope that arose in the progressing animal after the onset of AIDS. These envelope variations affected the length of the variable loops and the loadings of the different regions of the envelope. In addition, multiple mutations were located in the binding sites of CD4 and CCR5, which could affect receptor binding affinity, viral fitness, and could be selected for in late stages of disease. More importantly, these envelope mutations are not random, as they were repeatedly observed in a rhesus macaque and a human infant infected with SHIV or HIV-1, respectively, carrying the parental envelope of the infectious molecular clone SHIV-1157ipd3N4. Furthermore, similar mutations from other studies were also observed in different clades of envelopes, regardless of host species. These recurrent mutations in different envelopes suggest that there may be a common evolutionary pattern and selection pathway for the HIV-1 envelope during disease progression.",,"Tso, F.

Fifty-nine EV-G sequences, which were > 5,000 nucleotides long, were obtained. By complete sequence analysis of VP1, Japanese EV-G isolates were classified as G1 (17 strains), G2 (four strains), G3 (22 strains), G4 (two strains), G6 (two strains), G9 (six strains), G10 (five strains) and a new genotype (one strain). Surprisingly, 16 G1 and one G2 strains identified in diarrheal (23.5%; four strains) or normal (76.5%; 13 strains) fecal samples possessed a papain-like cysteine protease (PL-CP) sequence, which it was recently found in the US and Belgium in the EV-G genome, at the 2C-3A binding site. This article presents the first report of the high prevalence of PL-CP-carrying viruses in the EV-G population. In addition, potential intergenotype and intragenotype recombination events were found among EV-G strains, including G1-PL-CP strains.

2097,Identification of a new bovine enterovirus possessing highly divergent amino acid sequences in the capsid protein,"Background: Bovine enterovirus (BEV) belongs to the species Enterovirus E or F, genus Enterovirus and family Picornaviridae. Although numerous studies have identified BEVs in the feces of cattle with diarrhea, the pathogenicity of BEVs remains unclear. Previously, we reported the detection of a new kobu-like virus in calf feces, by metagenomic analysis. In the present study, we identified a novel BEV in diarrheal stools collected for that survey. Whole genome sequences were determined by deep stool sequencing. Secondary RNA structure analyzes of the 5-inch untranslated region (UTR), phylogenetic tree construction, and pairwise identity analysis were performed. Results: The complete genome sequences of BEV were genetically distant from other EVs and the VP1 coding region contained new and unique amino acid sequences. We call this strain BEV AN12/Bos taurus/JPN/2014 (referred to as BEV-AN12). According to genome analysis, the genome length of this virus is 7414 nucleotides excluding the poly(A) tail and its genome consists of a 5'UTR open reading frame, encoding a single polyprotein, and a 3'UTR . The results of secondary RNA structure analysis showed that at the 5'UTR, BEV-AN12 had an additional cloverleaf structure and a small stem-loop structure, similar to other BEVs. In pairwise identity analysis, BEV-AN12 showed high amino acid (aa) identities with Enterovirus F in the polyprotein regions, P2 and P3 (aa identity ≥82.4%). Therefore, BEV-AN12 is closely related to Enterovirus F. However, the aa sequences in the capsid protein regions, in particular the VP1 coding region, showed significantly low aa identity with respect to other virus of the genus Enterovirus (aa identity of VP1 ≤ 58.6%). In addition, BEV-AN12 branched separately from Enterovirus E and F in phylogenetic trees based on P1 and VP1 aa sequences, although it clustered with Enterovirus F in trees based on sequences in the P2 and P3 genomic region. Conclusions: We identified novel BEVs that possess highly divergent aa sequences in the VP1 coding region in Japan. According to the species definition, we proposed naming this strain as ""Enterovirus K"", which is a new species within the Enterovirus genus. More genomic studies are needed to understand the pathogenicity of BEVs.",,"Tsuchiaka, S.;Rahpaya, S.

2098,Evidence for serological diversity within group C rotaviruses,"The Cowden strain of porcine rotavirus group C and the Shintoku strain of bovine rotavirus group C were classified as different serotypes by two-way cross-neutralization tests. Two neutralization patterns against Cowden and Shintoku strains were observed when hyperimmune or convalescent-phase antisera were used against three nonculturable porcine group C rotaviruses and one human group C rotavirus in one-way cross-neutralization tests. Antisera against two group C porcine rotaviruses and group C human rotavirus neutralized the Cowden strain at high titers but did not neutralize the Shintoku strain, suggesting that these three strains are serotypically related to the Cowden strain. The remaining antisera against a group C porcine rotavirus (HF strain) reacted with Cowden and Shintoku group C rotaviruses in cell culture immunofluorescence tests, but did not neutralize either virus in unidirectional cross-neutralization, suggesting that the HF strain belongs to a third party. serotype However, confirmation of these findings requires further analysis by bidirectional cross-neutralization. Our findings support the existence of at least two distinct serotypes of group C rotaviruses, and possibly a third, between animals and humans. The serotypic similarity observed between the Cowden strain and a human group C rotavirus suggests that the culturable Cowden strain and antiserum to this virus may provide important reagents for the diagnosis of group C rotaviruses in humans.",,"Tsunemitsu, H.;Jiang, B.;Yamashita, Y.;Oseto, M.;Ushijima, H.;Saif, L.

Although studies on rotavirus group A (RVA) have been conducted in Thailand, reports on rotavirus group C (RVC) are limited. Here, our aim was to identify the prevalence of RVC circulating in Thai commercial pig farms.

Three samples tested positive for all three viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene showed that the most frequent RVC genotype was G1, which clustered with the RVC Cowden prototype strain. While G6 and G9 were also common, G3 was relatively rare. Analysis of the VP4 gene revealed that the most common P type was P[5], followed by P[4], P[7], and P[1].

Bivens Arm virus was first isolated from Culicoides insignis, suggesting that this genus also transmits BAV. A serological survey of two small groups of cattle raised on St. Croix and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean established that antibodies to BAV, or a closely related virus, exist on both islands.

2102,Antigenic relationship between influenza A viruses of human and animal origin,"Reciprocal antigenic relationships among 17 influenza A viruses of human, swine, equine, and avian origin were investigated by strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and complement fixation (CF). Cross-reactions were observed between the following strains: (a) Equi/1/Prague/1/56, fowl plague (Dutch strain) and Turkey/England/1/63 (Langham strain); (b) Equi/2/Miami/1/63, Quail/Italy/1117/65, Pheasant/Italy/647/66, Duck/England/1/62, and Turkey/Canada/1/63; c) A2/Singapore/1/57 and Turkey/Massachusetts/65; (d) Pork/S15/30 and Chicken/Scotland/1/59. The results of HI tests performed with post-infection sera generally showed a narrower specificity than those of HI with hyperimmune sera or strain-specific CF. Clearly, there is no clear demarcation of antigenic subtypes for influenza A viruses, and studies of an even broader range of strains are likely to reveal a continuous spectrum of antigenic variation for the entire group. The authors suggest that, in practice, host specificity, rather than antigenic specificity, may have to be used as the primary criterion for classifying influenza A viruses.",,"Tumova, B.;Pereira, H.

2103,Gene-focused metagenomic analysis of the feline gut microbiome using 454 junior pyrosequencing,"The feline gastrointestinal microbiota has a direct influence on feline health and also on human health as a reservoir for potential zoonotic pathogens and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. In order to describe feline gastrointestinal microbial diversity, fecal samples from cats were characterized using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. However, data correlating total microbial composition and functions are lacking. The present descriptive study evaluated the phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of the feline gut microbiota using GS Junior titanium shotgun pyrosequencing. A total of 152,494 pyrosequencing reads (5,405 assembled contigs) were generated and classified into phylogenetic and metabolic profiles of the feline gut microbiota. The Bacteroides/Chlorobi group was the most predominant bacterial phylum comprising ~. 68% of the total diversity classified, followed by Firmicutes (~.13%) and Proteobacteria (~.6%) respectively. Archaea, fungi, and viruses constituted the minor communities in the overall microbial diversity. Interestingly, this study also identified a variety of potential enteric zoonotic pathogens (0.02-1.25%) and genes involved in antimicrobial resistance (0.02-0.7%) in feline fecal matter. Based on clustering among nine gastrointestinal metagenomes from five different monogastric hosts (dog, human, mouse, cat, and chicken), the cat metagenome clustered very closely with chicken at both the phylogenetic and metabolic levels (>80%).

Cotia virus grew in a wide range of cell cultures and in chicken chorioallantois (CAM). Its growth characteristics are similar to those of other poxviruses. Microscopy showed virus factories or type B inclusions appearing before infectious virus progeny could be demonstrated. Type A inclusions appeared later, after the development of virus progeny; these were shown to differ from the type A inclusions of cowpox and other poxviruses by electron microscopy and have been termed Cotia bodies. Immunofluorescent staining also showed ring structures that appeared before the development of Cotia bodies. Growth of Cotia virus in human embryonic lung (HEL) cells was sensitive to inhibitors of protein and DNA synthesis, but was resistant to a concentration of rifampin that inhibited vaccinia virus. Antigen exchange between Cotia virus and vaccinia virus was demonstrated by gel precipitation tests and immunofluorescent staining.

2107,Use of DOP-PCR in the detection of non-specific viruses,"Detection and identification of pathogens in any given sample without any knowledge about the pathogen requires the combination of sample purification and generic signal amplification. Our universal virus detection assay combines virus capsid purification with a generic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) optimized for virus-sized genomes. As a general strategy, biochemical and physical purification by targeted digestion of contaminating host nucleic acids precedes nucleic acid extraction. RNA is transcribed into cDNA; The cDNA and DNA are then used as templates for degenerate oligonucleotide primer PCR (DOP-PCR). This PCR uses a set of related but different primers, combining degenerate and specific hybridization conditions. PCR products can be identified by cloning and sequencing, microarrays, or high-throughput sequencing. We detected enveloped and non-enveloped DNA and RNA viruses by DOP-PCR in cell culture as well as in clinical samples. The assay has the ability to detect single and double stranded genomes, circular genomes, segmented genomes, and linear genomes. Both the genomes of large viruses such as herpesvirus and the genomes of very small viruses (eg, circovirus) can be detected with sensitivity in the same assay. The DOP-PCR assay can be used to identify viruses directly from biological samples or cell cultures. An important feature of DOP-PCR is its ability to amplify viral sequences without prior knowledge of those sequences, which increases the probability of finding novel or mutated viruses. Combined with high-throughput sequencing, DOP-PCR is a very sensitive tool that can potentially be used for characterization of a given sample. ©PDA, Inc. 2011.",,"Uhlenhaut, C.;McClenahan, S.;Krause, P.

IT-227/82 is an antigenic variant of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) of chickens. The genome is 15,192 nucleotides (nt) in length, similar to the previously published NDV strain ZJ1. However, it is six nt longer than the genomes of NDV strains LaSota/46 and Beaudette C. The six nt insert was located in the 5â€² noncoding region of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene. The presence of this six nt insert showed no correlation with the virulence or reservoir of NDV strains sequenced so far. However, the genome length of 15,186 or 15,192 nt can be connected to ""old"" (I, II, III, and IV) and ""new"" (V, VI, VII, and VIII) NDV genotypes, respectively. Comparison of open reading frames indicated that PPMV-1 strain IT-227/82 encodes the longest W protein (227 amino acids). W protein length showed notable differences even within genotypes and therefore cannot be considered as a phylogenetic feature. The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein of strain IT-227/82 consists of 571 amino acids, similar to NDV strains of genotypes IV, V, and VII, while genotype I and II strains have longer HN proteins, 616 and 577 amino acids, respectively.

To date, only one monoclonal antibody assay is available for the specific identification of pigeon-like strains. A specific genetic assay suitable for the identification of isolated pigeons is described. Cleavage site analysis of a 1349 bp amplicon of the fusion protein gene was carried out using the restriction enzymes (RE) HinfI, BstOI and RsaI. RE analysis of more than 100 strains isolated between 1978 and 2002 derived from 16 countries has revealed nine RE patterns, which were progressive site variants of the parental genotype (group VI). Despite substantial site variation, extant pigeon viruses lacked a BstOI cleavage site at nucleotide 1601 shared by other NDV strains of chicken origin.

There are two genotypes, BVDV 1 and 2, and they are discriminated based on the sequence of the 5â€² non-coding region (5'NCR) by real-time PCR. Real-time PCR is more sensitive, specific, and less time consuming than conventional PCR, and has less risk of sample cross-contamination. There is limited information on the genetic subtypes of BVDV in South Africa. The aim of this study was to determine the BVDV genotypes currently circulating in South African feedlots. A total of 279 samples (219 tissue samples, 59 transtracheal aspirates, and 1 blood sample) were collected from dead and live cattle with lesions or clinical signs consistent with BVDV infection. Pooled homogenates from the same animals were prepared and total RNA was extracted. A screening test was performed on the pooled samples and the positive pools were investigated individually. A Cador BVDV Type 1/2 RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was used for real-time PCR assay on a LightCycler® V2. 0 real-time PCR machine (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Results were read at 530 and 640 nm for BVDV 1 and 2, respectively. Bovine viral diarrhea virus was detected in a total of 103 samples including 91 tissue samples, 1 blood sample, and 11 transtracheal aspirates.

All strains had genome lengths of 15,192 nucleotides consisting of six genes in the order of 3â€²-NP-P/V/WMF-HN-L-5â€². The general genomic characteristics of the Japanese field strains were consistent with previously characterized class II NDV, except for those belonging to early genotypes (genotype I-IV), which lack the six nucleotide insertion at nucleotide positions 1,648- 1653 of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Japanese strains could be classified into genotypes VIc and VIIe using the complete genome sequence and the complete coding sequence of the fusion (F) gene according to the NDV unified classification system. Characterization of the functional domains and neutralizing epitopes of the F and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins of the Japanese field strains revealed a total of 31 amino acid substitutions, compared with the widely used Ishii and B1 vaccine strains. in Japan.

2113,Molecular epidemiology of Newcastle disease virus isolates from vaccinated commercial poultry farms in non-epidemic areas of Japan,"Background: Newcastle disease (ND) is a highly contagious and economically devastating disease of poultry. Limited molecular epidemiological data are currently available on the causes of Newcastle disease outbreaks in vaccinated commercial poultry farms. Knowing the genomic characteristics of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that infects commercial poultry operations despite vaccination could provide important insights into the infection dynamics of these viruses. In addition, molecular analyzes at the subgenotype level and studies on the relationship of Japanese NDVs with other isolates from around the world are lacking. Therefore, in the present study, a molecular epidemiological investigation was conducted to characterize nine NDV isolates from vaccinated commercial poultry flocks in five different prefectures in non-epidemic areas of Japan between 1969 and 2002. Methods. Phylogenetic and nucleotide sequencing studies were performed to characterize the entire fusion protein (F) gene, the leading 3 end of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene, and the leading 5 end of the RNA polymerase (L) gene. RNA dependent. Sequence data was compared with 180 NDV strains from GenBank representing different NDV genotypes and subgenotypes from different regions of the world at different time periods. The deduced amino acids were analyzed for homologies, recombination, and mutation. Recombination events were estimated using the Recombination Detection Program (RDP) version 3.44. Phylogenetic trees were constructed to determine the evolutionary relationships between strains. Results: mean time to death (MDT: 48-56 h), intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI: 1.7-1.9), and deduced amino acid sequences of the F0 proteolytic cleavage site (§ssupÂ§112Â§esupÂ§RRQKRÂ §ssupÂ§116Â§ esupÂ§) revealed that all nine field isolates were velogenic. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these isolates could be classified into two genetic lineages and three sublineages, namely genotypes VIa (lineage 4a), VId (lineage 4d), and VIId (lineage 5d). No recombination events were observed, but a point mutation in one of the neutralizing epitopes of the F protein was identified in field isolates from Japan. Conclusions: All field isolates from vaccinated commercial birds in non-epidemic areas of Japan were part of much larger outbreaks in provinces and regions and, in some cases, continents. Overall, four Newcastle disease panzootics occurred in Japan and these outbreaks were mainly characterized by co-circulation of genetically distinct virus lineages due to the involvement of infected wild birds. The point mutation identified in field isolates from Japan may be due to leakage of vaccine pressure. Identification of such a mutation may be useful for future site-directed mutagenesis to understand the dynamics of NDV infection in vaccinated chickens. © 2013 Umali et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Umali, D.

Clinical and molecular characterizations were performed on five clinical cases of DN in vaccinated commercial layer farms from four provinces in the Philippines, namely Bulacan, Pampanga, Zamboanga del Sur and Davao Del Sur. Clinical signs observed in affected flocks were conjunctivitis, panting, tracheal rales, facial swelling, lethargy, greenish diarrhoea, torticollis and paralysis. Disease onset ranged from 21 to 124 days with mortality rates from 15 to 61%. The macroscopic morphological lesions identified were the presence of serous exudates in the infraorbital sinuses, hemorrhagic trachea, inflamed spleen, liver, and kidneys, and petechial hemorrhages in the cecal proventriculus and tonsils. Nucleotide sequencing showed that all field strains were velogenic with an FO proteolytic cleavage site of patterns 112RRRKRz.ast;F117 and 112RRQKRz.ast;F117. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all field NDV strains belong to class II, genotype VII, Vila, Vllh and Vili subgenotypes.

PCR, immunological assays, and enzyme activity tests represent common methods for detecting viral infections. We have analyzed over 300 RNA sequencing datasets from the Encyclopedia of Cancer Cell Lines and 60 whole exome sequencing human cell line datasets for specific viral sequences and overall evaluation of viral nucleotide and protein sequences by applying the Taxonomer bioinformatics tool developed by IDbyDNA. The results were compared with our previous findings from virus-specific PCR analyses. Both the results obtained with the direct alignment method and the taxonomer alignment method revealed full agreement with the PCR results: twenty cell lines were found to be infected with five virus species. The taxonomist also discovered a bovine polyomavirus infection in the breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3, probably introduced by contaminated fetal bovine serum. RNA-Seq data sets were more sensitive for virus detection, although a significant proportion of cell lines revealed low numbers of virus-specific alignments attributable to low-level nucleotide contamination during RNA preparation or procedure. of sequencing. Low-quality reads that lead to false-positive Taxonomer results can be eliminated by trimming sequence data prior to analysis.

2116,bovine ephemeral fever,"Ephemeral fever remains a viral disease of considerable importance to many countries, including Australia. The virus has only been partially characterized and is still awaiting final classification. Although EAB virus was initially thought to contain 6 structural proteins, increasing evidence suggests that it contains all 5 proteins characteristic of Rhabdoviridae. Although EAB is thought to be transmitted by arthropods, the vector has not yet been identified, but it is clear from the distribution of EAB that more than one vector is capable of transmitting the disease. Despite rigorous investigation of the clinical signs and pathology of ephemeral fever, little progress has been made in the pathogenesis of the disease. This has been due in part to the difficulty of propagating BEF virus in vitro and the inability to define the site of replication. However, there is increasing evidence to suggest that EFB is immunopathological in nature and that the clinical expression of the disease is influenced by the release of one or more inflammatory mediators. The disease is characterized by a series of hematological and biochemical changes, and early and prolonged treatment with phenylbutazone is capable of reversing a series of these changes. Intravenous calcium administration can now be considered a justifiable addition to the treatment regimen in conjunction with prolonged phenylbutazone therapy. Currently available vaccines are prepared from live attenuated or killed viruses and may be less reliable. There appears to be a need for an alternative vaccine that is reliable, inexpensive, and independent of the cold chain.",,"Uren, M. F.",1989.0,,,0
2117,Unmapped Reads from Cattle RNAseq Data: A Source of Missing and Misassembled Sequences in Reference Assemblies and for Host Pathogen Detection,"Reads from transcriptome sequencing data not mapped to the reference genome of the target species are generally discarded. A recent RNAseq project on the new fatal disease bovine neonatal pancytopenia had indicated an unexplained immune response signature to a double-stranded RNA virus. To unravel their background, contigs were assembled de novo from unmapped RNAseq reads and aligned to bovine genome assemblies and NCBI multispecies databases. The lack of genuine virus sequence contigs refuted the hypothesis that a live virus is the cause of the unexplained immune response. Alignment data also demonstrated incomplete reference bovine genome assemblies. In addition, we found that several virus and parasite genome reference assemblies in NCBI were contaminated with bovine DNA and confirmed recombination of bovine DNA in BVD virus strains. Scanning of unmapped reads can extract useful biological information about the presence of microorganisms and can highlight problems with reference genome assemblies of host and pathogenic species.",,"Usman, T.;Hadlich, F.;Demasius, W.;Weikard, R.;Kuhn, C.",2017.0,1,,0
2118,"Sequencing and sequence analysis of the partial nucleoprotein (N) gene and phylogenetic analysis of field isolates of rabies virus from Gujarat state, India","The present study was carried out with the objective of characterizing the rabies virus (genus Lyssavirus of the family Rhabdoviridae under the order Mononegavirales) by sequencing the partial nucleoprotein (N) gene of the rabies virus and the phylogenetic analysis to know the genotype and lineage of the rabies virus present. in the Gujarat state of India. A total of 32 samples (18 brain samples and 14 saliva samples) from live and dead animals (ie, dog, buffalo, cow, goat, donkey, and hyena) were collected aseptically for rabies virus detection. Of the 32 samples, 24 samples were positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions, and of these 24 positive samples, 20 samples were selected for sequencing that had a good concentration of gene product.

Among these viruses are 3 human protoparvoviruses: bufavirus, tusavirus and cutavirus. These viruses have been detected in the feces of children with diarrhea. In addition, cutavirus has been detected in skin biopsy samples from patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in France and in 1 patient with melanoma in Denmark. We studied IgG seroprevalences against bufaviruses, tusaviruses, and cutaviruses in various populations (n = 840), and found a striking geographic difference in bufavirus IgG prevalence. Although the prevalence was low in the adult populations of Finland (1.9%) and the United States (3.6%), bufavirus IgG was highly prevalent in the populations of Iraq (84.8%), Iran (56 .1%) and Kenya (72.3%).

These viruses have been studied exclusively by PCR in feces and detected only in patients with diarrhea, although with low prevalence. Three BuV genotypes have been identified. We detected, by internal EIA, BuV1-3 IgG antibodies in 7/228 children (3.1%) and 10/180 adults (5.6%), while TuV IgG was found in one child (0.4%). All the children and 91% of the adults were Finnish, but interestingly 3/6 adults of Indian origin were positive for BuV-IgG. By EIA competition, no cross-reactivity between BuVs was detected, indicating that the BuV genotypes represent distinct serotypes. In addition, we analyzed stool samples and nasal swabs from 955 children with gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, or both, using BuV QPCR, and found BuV DNA in three stools (0.3%) and, for the first time, in one nasal swab (0.3%). ,one %). This is the first study to document the presence of BuV and TuV antibodies in humans.

2121,Phylogeny based on the S1 gene of infectious bronchitis virus: an attempt to harmonize virus classification,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the causative agent of a highly contagious disease that generates serious economic losses for the global poultry industry. The virus exists in a wide variety of genetically distinct viral types, and both phylogenetic analysis and measures of pairwise similarity between nucleotide or amino acid sequences have been used to classify IBV strains. However, there is currently no consensus on the method by which IBV sequences should be compared, and heterogeneous genetic group designations have been adopted that are inconsistent with phylogenetic history, leading to the confusing coexistence of multiple genotyping schemes. . In this paper, we propose a simple and repeatable phylogeny-based classification system combined with a rational and unambiguous lineage nomenclature for the assignment of IBV strains. Using complete nucleotide sequences of the S1 gene, we determined the phylogenetic structure of IBV, which in turn allowed us to define 6 genotypes that together comprise 32 distinct viral lineages and a number of cross-lineage recombinants. Due to the wide rate variation among IBVs, we suggest that inference of phylogenetic relationships alone represents a more appropriate criterion for sequence classification than pairwise comparisons of sequences. The adoption of an internationally accepted viral nomenclature is crucial for future studies on the epidemiology and evolution of IBV, and the classification scheme presented here may be updated and new revised S1 sequences should become available.",,"Valastro, V.;Holmes, E.

2122,Genetic typing and prevalence of border disease virus (BDV) in small ruminant herds in Spain,"Between 2001 and 2002, samples from 1413 animals from 21 Spanish small ruminant herds, most of them with animals showing clinical signs compatible with Border Disease (BD), were analyzed for the presence of Pestivirus antigen and antibodies. by indirect monolayer peroxidase assay (IPMA) and virus neutralization test (VNT), respectively. Although all flocks harbored seropositive animals, virus could only be isolated from animals in five of the flocks. Between 4 and 11 months later, all animals older than 6 months in three of the herds were re-sampled. At that time, 51-83% of them had neutralizing antibodies. The prevalence of persistently infected (PI) animals within two of the herds was 0.3 and 0.6%, respectively. The third flock had presumably eliminated all PI animals. Fourteen virus isolates were obtained. The 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) was amplified by RT-PCR and directly sequenced. Phylogenetic analyzes classified them as a group of border disease viruses (BDV), separate from BDV-1, but showing a relatively low bootstrap value. Three of the 14 isolates were in the same subgroup as a previously characterized set of Spanish isolates from the Basque Country, which were assigned to the BDV-C subgroup. Furthermore, they were in the group with a chamois isolate, which is currently in the BDV-4 group. Due to their close relationship to the chamois isolate, these isolates were tentatively reassigned to a BDV-4a subgroup. The remaining isolates generated a new subgroup, related to but not in the same group as the chamois isolate, and thus tentatively assigned to a new BDV-4b subgroup.

2124,Anaplasma marginale superinfection attributable to pathogenic strains with different genomic backgrounds,"Strain superinfection occurs when a second pathogenic strain infects a host already infected with a primary strain. The selective pressures driving strain divergence, underlying superinfection, and allowing penetration of a new strain into a host population are critical knowledge gaps relevant to changes in the epidemiology of infectious diseases. In endemic regions with a high prevalence of infection, broad population immunity develops against Anaplasma marginale, a highly antigenically variant rickettsial pathogen, and creates strong selective pressure for emergence and superinfection with strains that differ in their repertoires of Msp2 variants. . Strains can arise either by duplication of the msp2 locus and allelic divergence in an existing genomic background or by introduction of a strain with a different msp2 allele repertoire into a different genomic background. To answer this question, we developed a multilocus typing assay based on high-throughput sequencing of non-msp2 target loci to distinguish between strains with different genomic backgrounds. The level of technical error was statistically defined based on the percentage of perfect clone sequence matches for each target locus and validated using single experimental strains and pairs of strains. Testing of A. marginale-positive samples from tropical regions where A. marginale infection is endemic identified individual infections containing unique alleles for all five target loci. The data revealed a highly significant difference in the number of strains per animal in tropical regions compared to infections in temperate regions and strongly supported the hypothesis that transmission of genomically distinct strains of A. marginale predominates in endemic areas of high prevalence.",,"Vallejo Esquerra, E.;Herndon, D.

2125,What's in a strain? Viral metagenomics identifies genetic variation and contaminating circoviruses in laboratory isolates of pigeon paramyxovirus type 1,"We used next-generation sequencing on randomly amplified viral nucleic acids to determine the genome sequence of 11 isolates of pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1) from Belgium (period 1998-2011). PPMV-1 deep sequence data allowed the identification of sequence variability in multiple PPMV-1 isolates, including a STOP codon in the Matrix gene that was present in 15% of the viral population of one isolate. Notably, mutations previously associated with pathogenicity in chickens were identified as minor sequence variants in a parent laboratory strain. A phylogenetic analysis of the consensus sequences of the PPMV-1 genome was performed. In addition to providing nearly complete paramyxovirus genomic sequences, our sequence-independent approach identified the presence of pigeon circovirus (PiCV) sequences in four of these viral populations. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis specific for PMV-1 and PiCV showed that these contaminations were present in seven viral stocks consisting of allantoic fluids and were also occasionally detected in stocks passed in embryonated chicken eggs. Phylogenetic analysis of the PiCV consensus genomic sequences showed a circulation of PiCVs that covered the entire genetic diversity of known PiCVs. Coinfecting viruses or sequence variants of the original sample may persist in the pools without being identified by routine virus-specific diagnostic tools. The exact role of PiCV in pigeon disease, in particular Newcastle disease, and its possible interference with PPMV-1 diagnosis remains to be investigated. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",,"Van Borm, S.;Rosseel, T.;Steensels, M.;Van den Berg, T.;Lambrecht, B.",2013.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2012.11.017,0

HEV genotype 3 (Gt3) infections are endemic in pigs in Western Europe and North and South America and cause zoonotic infections in humans. Several serological assays have been developed to detect antibodies against HEV in pigs, initially based mainly on HEV genotype 1 (Gt1) antigens. To develop a sensitive HEV Gt3 ELISA, a recombinant baculovirus expression product of HEV Gt3 open reading frame 2 was produced and coated onto polystyrene ELISA plates. After incubation of the porcine sera, bound HEV antibodies were detected with anti-porcine anti-IgG and anti-IgM conjugates. For the primary estimation of the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, pools of sera from pigs experimentally infected with HEV Gt3 were used. For further validation of the assay and to establish the cut-off value, a batch of 1100 pig sera was used. All pig sera were tested using the developed HEV Gt3 assay and two other serological assays based on HEV Gt1 antigens. Since there is no gold standard available for HEV antibody tests, further validation and definitive adjustment of the cutoff value of the developed HEV Gt3 assay was performed using a statistical approach based on Bayes' theorem. The developed and validated HEV antibody assay showed efficient detection of HEV-specific antibodies. This assay may contribute to a better detection of HEV antibodies and allow more reliable estimates of the prevalence of HEV Gt3 in pigs in different regions.",,"van der Poel, W. H.

Classification of this virus has been based on partial sequence analysis of the cDNA of a virus-producing cell line, PH969. We obtained the complete nucleotide sequence of this virus with a proviral genome of 8,916 bp. All major genes, homologous in all viruses related to human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV), and their corresponding mRNAs, including appropriate splicing, were identified. An additional non-homologous open reading frame in the proximal pX region can be accessed for translation through alternative splicing. Sequence comparison shows that STLV-PH969 is equidistantly related to HTLV type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-2. Across all coding regions, similarity tends to be lowest between STLV-PH969 and HTLV-1. However, in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region, the lowest similarity was found between STLV-PH969 and HTLV-2. The U3-R and R-U5 boundaries of the STLV-PH969 LTR were experimentally determined at nucleotides 268 and 52.4, respectively. This 695 bp LTR is 60 and 73 bp shorter than the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 LTRs, respectively, but its general organization is similar to that found in the HTLV-bovine leukemia virus genus. In the long region between the polyadenylation signal and the poly(A) site, sequence similarity to the core HTLV-1 Rex responsive element (RexRE) and secondary structure prediction suggest the presence of a RexRE. The presence of three 21 bp repeats is conserved within the U3 region of HTLV-1, HTLV-2 and BLV. Only two direct repeats with similarity to these Tax-sensitive elements were found in the STLV-PH969 LTR, which could suggest differences in the Tax-mediated transactivation of this virus. We conclude that STLV-PH969 has all the genes and genomic regions to suggest a replication cycle comparable to that of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.",,"Van Marianne, B.;Goubau, P.;Rousseau, R.;Desmyter, J.;Vandamme, A.

2133,Genetic heterogeneity in the Leader and 3C proteinases of foot-and-mouth disease virus,"The FMDV proteinases Leader and 3C are responsible for almost all proteolytic processing events of the viral polyprotein precursor. Investigation of the genetic heterogeneity of the regions encoding these proteins from isolates of six FMD virus serotypes revealed that the 3C proteinase is more conserved than the Leader proteinase. Maximum likelihood analysis indicated similar phylogenetic groupings for the Leader and 3C nonstructural protein coding regions. These clusters were different from the VP1 structural protein coding region which, as shown above, clustered according to serotype. Two distinct clades were evident for the Leader and 3C coding regions: one comprising serotypes A, O and C along with SAT (South African Territories) isolates from East Africa. The other clade consisted of SAT isolates originating from southern Africa. Only one virus isolate, obtained from a buffalo in Uganda, did not fit this phylogenetic pattern. This SAT 1 virus clustered with types A, O, and C in the Leader analysis, but with SAT types from southern Africa in the 3C analysis, implying intertypic reassortment. The leading proteinases of the SAT-type isolates from southern Africa differed from those present in the European-type isolates, particularly in the self-processing region. A three-dimensional structure for the Leader proteinase from one of the SAT-like viruses, ZIM/7/83/2, was modeled and compared with the previously elucidated crystal structure of the Leader O1Kaufbeuren proteinase. The active sites of the two leaders were found to overlap closely, despite the observed sequence variation between the two molecules. Comparison of proteinase 3C P1 cleavage sites suggested that FMD virus 3C proteinase may possess a broader substrate specificity, as seen in hepatitis A virus 3C proteinase. © 2002 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Van Rensburg, H.;Haydon, D.;Joubert, F.;Bastos, A.;Heath, L.;Nel, L.",2002.0,,10.1016/s0378-1119(02)00471-7,0

The amino acids of the eight segments were concatenated, aligned and used for phylogenetic analyses. In addition, the genes of the polymerase complex (PB1, PB2 and PA) were analyzed individually. All of our results showed the Brevig-Mission/1918 strain in a basal position relative to the rest of the clade containing human H1N1 and were consistent with a rearrangement hypothesis for the origin of the 1918 virus. The phylogeny of our genome further indicates a relationship of sisters with the ""classical"" porcine H1N1 lineage. The individual phylogenies of PB1, PB2, and PA were consistent with the rearrangement/recombination hypotheses for these genes.

2135,An ecological and conservation perspective on advances in applied virology of zoonoses,"The goal of this manuscript is to describe how modern advances in our understanding of viruses and viral evolution can be applied to the fields of disease ecology and conservation. We review recent progress in virology and provide examples of how it is informing both empirical research in field ecology and applied conservation. We include a discussion of the necessary advances and ways to close the communication gaps between the field and the laboratory. In an effort to further this interdisciplinary effort, we have also included a table listing definitions of key terms. The importance of understanding the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in their reservoir hosts is emphasized as a tool to assess risk factors for spread and test hypotheses related to treatment and/or intervention strategies. In conclusion, we highlight the need for smart surveillance, viral discovery efforts, and predictive modeling. A shift to a predictive approach is necessary in today's globalized society because, as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated, post-emergency identification is often too late to prevent global spread. The integration of molecular virology and ecological techniques will enable earlier recognition of potentially dangerous pathogens, ideally before they jump from wildlife reservoirs into human or livestock populations and cause serious public health or conservation problems. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Vandegrift, K.

2136,Comparative genome sequencing identifies a prophage-associated genomic island linked to host adaptation of Lawsonia intracellularis infections,"Lawsonia intracellularis is an obligate intracellular bacterium and the causative agent of proliferative enteropathy (PD). The disease is endemic in pigs, emerging in horses, and has also been reported in a variety of other animal species, including non-human primates. By comparing the whole genome sequences of a homologous isolate of porcine L. intracellularis grown for 10 and 60 passages in vitro, we identified an 18-kb prophage-associated genomic island at passage 10 (pathogenic variant) that was lost at passage 60. (non-pathogenic variant). This chromosomal island comprises 15 genes downstream of the DLP12 prophage integrase gene. The prevalence of this genetic element was evaluated in 12 other L. intracellularis isolates and in 53 infected animals and was found to be conserved in all porcine isolates cultured for up to 20 passages and lost in isolates cultured for more than 40 passages. Furthermore, the prophage region was also present in 26 faecal samples derived from clinically affected pigs with acute and chronic forms of the disease. However, the equine L. intracellularis isolates tested did not harbor this genomic island regardless of in vitro passage. In addition, fecal samples from 21 clinically affected horses and four wild rabbits trapped on horse farms experiencing PE outbreaks did not show this prophage-associated island. Although the presence of this prophage-associated island was not essential for a virulent phenotype of L. intracellularis, this genetic element was specific to the porcine isolate and potentially contributed to the ecological specialization of this organism for the porcine host.",,"Vannucci, F.

2137,Sequence-based taxonomic framework for the classification of uncultured single-stranded DNA viruses of the family Genomoviridae,"With the advent of metagenomic approaches, a great diversity of known and unknown viruses have been identified in various types of environmental, plant, and animal samples. One such group of widespread viruses is the recently established family Genomoviridae, which includes viruses with small circular ssDNA genomes (similar to 2-2.4 kb) encoding rolling circle replication initiation proteins (Rep) and replication initiation proteins (Rep). of unique capsids. Here, we propose a sequence-based taxonomic framework for the classification of 121 novel virus genomes within this family. Genomoviruses show a sequence diversity similar to 47%, which is very similar to that of the well-established and widely studied family Geminiviridae (46% diversity). Based on our analysis, we set 78% genome-wide pairwise identity as the species demarcation threshold. Furthermore, using a phylogeny-based analysis of the Rep sequence together with current knowledge on geminivirus classification, we establish nine genera within the family Genomoviridae. These are Gemycircularvirus (n=73), Gemyduguivirus (n=1), Gemygorvirus (n=9), Gemykibivirus (n=29), Gemykolovirus (n=3), Gemykrogvirus (n=3), Gemykroznavirus (n=1) , Gemytondvirus (n = 1), Gemyvongvirus (n = 1). The presented taxonomic framework offers a rational classification of genomoviruses based solely on sequence information and sets an example for the future classification of other non-cultured virus groups discovered by metagenomic approaches.",,"Varsani, A.;Krupovic, M.",2017.0,Jan,,0
2138,Smacoviridae: a new family of animal-associated single-stranded DNA viruses,"Smacoviruses have small (similar to 2.3-2.9 kb) circular single-stranded DNA genomes that encode rolling circle replication-associated proteins (Rep) and unique capsid proteins. Although smacoviruses are prevalent in the feces of various vertebrates, including humans, none of these viruses have been cultured to date. Smacoviruses display a sequence diversity similar to 45% throughout the genome, which is very similar to that found in other families of circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA (CRESS) viruses, including members of the families Geminiviridae (46 % diversity) and Genomoviridae (47% diversity). Here, we announce the creation of a new family Smacoviridae and describe a sequence-based taxonomic framework that was used to classify 83 smacovirus genomes into 43 species within six new genera, Bovismacovirus (n=3), Cosmacovirus (n=1), Dragsmacovirus (n=1), Drosmacovirus (n=3), Huchismacovirus (n=7) and Porprismacovirus (n=28). As in the case of genomoviruses, species demarcation is based on genome-wide pairwise identity, while genera are established based on Rep amino acid sequence identity coupled with strong phylogenetic support. A similar sequence-based taxonomic framework should guide the classification of an astonishing diversity of other uncultured and currently unclassified CRESS DNA viruses discovered by metagenomic approaches.",,"Varsani, A.;Krupovic, M.",2018.0,Jul,,0
2139,A new variant of influenza virus-h1n1 swine flu virus,"In 2009, a strain of the swine-derived H1N1 virus commonly known as swine flu caused the 2009 influenza pandemic. Most cold-climate countries affected by the disease. On average, 41,000 people died each year in the US between 1979 and 2001 from the flu. Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is an infectious disease caused by RNA viruses of the Orthomyxoviridae family that affects birds and mammals. This virus is mainly classified into three types 1) Influenza A virus 2) Influenza B virus 3) Influenza C virus. Swine flu belongs to influenza A (H1N1) virus. The virus particle is 80-120 nanometers. It can be difficult to distinguish between the common cold and the flu in the early stages of the swine flu, but a flu can be identified by a high fever with sudden onset and extreme fatigue. Transmitted by three main forms of direct transmission, the airborne bone route and direct personal contact (such as handshake). As the influenza virus can persist outside the body, it can also be transmitted through contaminated surfaces such as banknotes, doorknobs, etc. H1N1 spreads easily and is rarely fatal. One of the mechanisms of H1N1 is thought to be inhibition of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), resulting in a decreased level of cortisol. Influenza viruses can be inactivated by sunlight, disinfectants, and detergents. Commonly used antivirals are oseltamivir and zanamivir, these are neuraminidase inhibitors, and amantadine and rimantadine block a viral ion channel and prevent the virus from infecting cells. Vaccines such as live intranasal monovalent vaccines, monovalent vaccines for intramuscular injection, fluzone, etc.",,"Veeranjaneyulu, T. N.;Seerishna, B.;Kiran, T. N. R.;Madhulatha, A. V.

2140,Autochthonous hepatitis E virus infection as a cause of acute hepatitis in Germany - A case report,"There is increasing evidence that hepatitis E virus (HEV) triggers acute hepatitis not only in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas with low sanitary standards, but also in highly industrialized countries. Here we report on two patients from Thuringia (Germany) with an HEV infection without a recent stay abroad. All other common causes of hepatitis were excluded. Transaminases increased significantly in both cases, while jaundice was found in only one patient. Both patients fully recovered in the long-term course. Epidemiological and phylogenetic data from viral analyzes suggest that HEV infection should be considered a zoonosis. Viral transmission from animals to humans is likely to occur through insufficiently cooked meat or offal, for example, from pigs or wild animals. In summary, HEV infection is a relevant differential diagnosis in non-A/B/C acute viral hepatitis. Further studies are required to identify other routes of transmission, pathogen reservoirs, as well as novel concepts for prophylaxis, especially for patients at risk of liver disease. © 2010 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.",,"Veitt, R.;Reichardt, M.;Wenzel, J.;Jilg, W.",2011.0,,10.1055/s-0029-1245767,0

Based on PCR analysis of 124 epithelial samples collected between 2007 and 2011 from naturally infected goats, sheep, and cattle in Mexico, we found that different PPVs were present in 21 of the 24 states sampled during this study. Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of different PPV species in Mexico and their phylogenetic relationship with other PPVs circulating in the United States and Canada. Furthermore, we describe the existence of two different ORFV phylogenetic groups that are clearly associated with the host (sheep or goats). Evidence for directional selection at five specific amino acid residues in the enveloped glycoprotein B2L could help support this host predilection. Together, the results generated in this study highlight the importance of the PPV genus in Mexico and open the possibility of future studies that describe in more detail the importance of this genus in North America.",,"Velazquez-Salinas, L.;Ramirez-Medina, E.;Bracht, A.

2142,Avian influenza viruses in wild birds: virus evolution in a multihost ecosystem,"Wild ducks and seagulls are the main reservoirs of avian influenza A viruses (AIV). The mechanisms driving AIV evolution are complex at sites where various species of ducks and gulls from multiple migratory routes breed, overwinter, or stage. The Republic of Georgia is located at the intersection of three migration routes: the Central Asian Flyway, the East African/West Asian Flyway, and the Black Sea/Mediterranean Flyway. Over six full years of study (2010 to 2016), we collected AIV samples from various species of ducks and gulls that breed, migrate, and hibernate in Georgia. We found a substantial diversity of virus subtypes that varied in prevalence from year to year. Low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) subtypes included H1N1, H2N3, H2N5, H2N7, H3N8, H4N2, H6N2, H7N3, H7N7, H9N1, H9N3, H10N4, H10N7, H11N1, H13N2, H13N6, H13N8, and H16N3, and two highly Pathogens AIV (HPAIV) belonging to clade 2.3.4.4, H5N5 and H5N8 were found. Genome-wide phylogenetic trees showed significant host species lineage restriction for almost all gene segments and significant differences in observed rearrangement rates, defined by quantification of phylogenetic inconsistency, and in nucleotide sequence diversity for LPAIV between different host species. Hemagglutinin clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 viruses, which circulated in Eurasia during 2014 and 2015, did not reassort, but analysis of their subsequent spread during 2016 and 2017 revealed reassortment in all gene segments except NP and NS. .

2143,Molecular characterization of Belgian pseudorabies virus isolates from domestic pigs and wild boar,"Aujeszky's disease is an economically important disease of domestic pigs caused by suid herpesvirus 1, also called pseudorabies virus (PRV). In several European countries, including Belgium, the virus has been successfully eradicated from the domestic pig population. However, the presence of PRV in the wild boar population poses a risk of possible reintroduction of the virus in the domestic pig population. Therefore, it is important to assess the genetic relationship between circulating strains and possible epidemiological links. In this study, nine historical isolates from Belgian domestic pigs circulating before 1990 and five recent isolates from wild boar obtained since 2006 in Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg were genetically characterized using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and phylogenetic analysis. While all wild boar isolates were characterized as type I RFLP genotypes, the RFLP patterns of domestic pig isolates suggest that a switch from genotype I to genotype II in the domestic population might have occurred in the 1980s. By phylogenetic analysis, Belgian wild boar isolates belonging to clades A and B were observed, while all domestic pig isolates were grouped within clade A. Joint phylogenetic analysis of wild boar and domestic pig strains showed that some isolates with identical sequences were present within both populations, raising the question of whether these strains pose a higher risk of virus reintroduction into the domestic population. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,"Verpoest, S.;Cay, A.

2144,The ability of UL49.5 proteins to inhibit TAP is widely distributed among members of the varicose virus genus.,"Lifelong varicellovirus infection is characterized by a delicate balance between the host's immune response and the immune evasion strategies used by these viruses. Virus-derived peptides are presented to cytotoxic T cells by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) transports peptides from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum, where loading of MHC-I molecules occurs. Varicella bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), pseudorabies virus, and equine herpesviruses 1 and 4 have been found to encode a UL49.5 protein that inhibits TAP-mediated peptide transport. To investigate the extent to which UL49.5-mediated TAP inhibition is conserved within the Alphaherpesvirinae family, homologues of five other varicose viruses, one mardivirus, and one iltovirus were studied. The UL49.5 proteins from BoHV-5, bubaline herpesvirus 1, cervid herpesvirus 1, and feline herpesvirus 1 were identified as potent inhibitors of TAP. Varicella-zoster virus and simian varicellovirus UL49.5 proteins do not block TAP; this is not due to the absence of viral cofactors that can help in this process, since cells infected with these viruses did not show reduced TAP function either. The UL49.5 homologues of mardivirus Marek's disease virus 1 and infectious laryngotracheitis virus iltovirus did not block TAP, suggesting that the ability to inhibit TAP via UL49.5 has been acquired solely by varicellovirus. A phylogenetic analysis of viruses that inhibit TAP through their UL49.5 proteins reveals an interesting inheritance pattern, pointing to the presence of this ability in defined clades within the Varicellovirus genus.

Sequence-independent reverse transcription and PCR amplification of capsid-protected nuclease-resistant viral nucleic acids were followed by DNA sequencing and sequence similarity searches. Limited Sanger sequencing (35 to 240 subclones per sample) identified an average of 1.4 different eukaryotic viruses per sample, while pyrosequencing yielded 2.6 viruses per sample.

Viruses with the most divergent sequences relative to previously reported viruses included members of a new genus Picornaviridae and four new viral species (members of the families Dicistroviridae, Nodaviridae and Circoviridae and the genus Bocavirus). Samples from six healthy contacts of AFP patients were similarly tested and also contained numerous viruses, notably HEV-C, including a potentially novel enterovirus genotype.

2148,Viral Nucleic Acids in Live Attenuated Vaccines: Detection of Minor Variants and an Adventitious Virus,"Metagenomics and a panmicrobial microarray were used to examine eight live attenuated viral vaccines. Viral nucleic acids in trivalent oral poliovirus (OPV), rubella, measles, yellow fever, varicella-zoster, multivalent measles/mumps/rubella, and two live rotavirus vaccines were partially purified, randomly amplified, and pyrosequencing. More than half a million sequence reads covering 20-99% of attenuated viral genomes were generated at depths reaching 8,000 reads per nucleotide. Minor mutations and variants were detected, relative to the vaccine strains, that are not known to affect attenuation in OPV, mumps virus, and varicella-zoster virus. The anticipated detection of endogenous retroviral sequences from avian and primate producer cells was confirmed. Avian leukosis virus (ALV), previously shown to be noninfectious to humans, was present as RNA in viral particles, while simian retrovirus (SRV) was present as genetically defective DNA. Rotarix, an orally administered rotavirus vaccine, contained porcine circovirus-1 (PCV1), a highly prevalent, non-pathogenic porcine virus, which has not been shown to be infectious in humans. Hybridization of the vaccine nucleic acids with a panmicrobial microarray confirmed the presence of endogenous retroviral and PCV1 nucleic acids. Thus, deep sequencing and microarrays can detect sequence changes of attenuated viruses, minor variants, and adventitious viruses and help maintain the current safety record of live attenuated viral vaccines.

Since its identification and characterization in the early 1990s, PCV-2 has achieved a worldwide distribution, becoming endemic in most pig-producing countries, and is now considered the leading cause of loss on pig farms. . In this study, we analyzed the main routes of spread of PCV-2 between pig-producing countries using phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches. A search of PCV-2 genome sequences was performed in GenBank, and the 420 PCV-2 sequences obtained were grouped into haplotypes (group of sequences that presented 100% identity), according to the model of infinite sites of PCV-2 evolution. genome. A phylogenetic hypothesis was inferred using Bayesian inference for the classification of viral strains, and a haplotype network was constructed using median joining to predict geographic distribution and genealogical relationships among haplotypes. To establish an epidemiological and economic context in these analyses, we considered all information on PCV-2 sequences available in GenBank, including published articles on viral isolation and live pig trade statistics available in the Comtrade database of the UN (http://comtrade.un.org/). In these analyses, we identified a strong correlation between means of PCV-2 dispersal predicted by the haplotype network and statistics on international trade in live pigs. This correlation provides a new perspective on the epidemiology of PCV-2, highlighting the importance of the movement of animals around the world in the emergence of new pathogens and showing the need for effective sanitary barriers when live animals are traded. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",,"Vidigal, P.

2153,"Hendra and Nipah Infection: Pathology, Models, and Potential Therapies","The Paramyxoviridae family comprises several genera containing emerging or re-emerging threats to human and animal health with no real specific effective treatment available. Hendra and Nipah viruses are members of a recently identified genus of emerging paramyxoviruses, Henipaviruses. Since its discovery in the 1990s, henipavirus outbreaks have been associated with high potential public health and economic threats. Compared to other paramyxoviruses, henipaviruses appear to have unique characteristics. Henipaviruses are zoonotic paramyxoviruses with a broader tropism than most other paramyxoviruses and can cause severe acute encephalitis with features unique among viral encephalitides. There are currently no approved effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatments for henipavirus infections. Although ribavirin was used empirically and appeared beneficial during the largest outbreak caused by one of these viruses, Nipah virus, its efficacy is questioned due to its lack of efficacy in various animal models of henipavirus infection. However, due to its highly pathogenic nature, much effort has been invested in developing anti-henipavirus therapies. In this review, we describe the unique features of henipavirus infections and the different strategies and animal models that have been developed so far to identify and test potential drugs to prevent or treat henipavirus infections. Some of these components have the potential to be broad-spectrum antivirals, as they target effectors of viral pathogenicity common to other viruses. We will focus on small molecules or biologics, rather than vaccine strategies, that have been developed as anti-henipaviral therapies. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",,"Vigant, F.;Lee, B.",2011.0,,,0
2154,Analysis of the crow lung transcriptome in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus infection,"The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus, currently circulating in Asia, causes severe disease in domestic poultry and wild birds such as crows. However, the molecular pathogenesis of HPAIV infection in ravens and other wild birds is poorly understood. Therefore, as a step to explore it, a comprehensive global gene expression analysis was performed on crow lungs, infected with crow isolate HPAI H5N1 (A/Crow/India/11TI11/2011) using next-generation sequencing (NGS). high performance (GS FLX Titanium XLR70). The raven reference genome is not available, so RNA sequence analysis was performed on the basis of a de novo assembled transcriptome. The RNA seq result shows that 4052 genes were uniquely expressed in uninfected samples, 6277 genes were uniquely expressed in HPAIV-infected samples and of the 6814 genes expressed in both samples, 2279 genes were significantly differentially expressed. Our transcriptome profiling data enables the ability to understand the molecular mechanism behind the recent lethal outbreak of HPAIV in crows which, until recently, was thought to cause lethal infections only in gallinaceous birds such as chickens, but not in wild birds. . The pattern of differentially expressed genes suggests that this H5N1 virus isolate evades the host's innate immune response by attenuating interferon (IFN)-inducible signaling, possibly by downregulating type I IFN signaling (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) and type II IFN receptors, upregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3 signaling inhibitors, and altering the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs).

2157,Full genome sequence of human coronavirus OC43: Molecular clock analysis suggests a relatively recent zoonotic coronavirus transmission event,"Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses with a genome of approximately 30 kb. Based on genetic similarities, coronaviruses are classified into three groups. Two group 2 coronaviruses, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), show remarkable antigenic and genetic similarities. In this study, we report the first complete genome sequence (30,738 nucleotides) of the prototype strain HCoV-OC43 (ATCC VR7S9). Genome-wide and open reading frame (ORF) analyzes were performed against the BCoV genome. In the region between the spike and membrane protein genes, a deletion of 290 nucleotides is present, corresponding to the absence of ORFs ns4.9 and ns4.8 of BCoV. Nucleotide and amino acid similarity percentages were determined for the major ORFs of HCoV-OC43 and for those of other group 2 coronaviruses. The highest degree of similarity is demonstrated between HCoV-OC43 and BCoV in all ORFs with the exception of gene E. Molecular clock analysis of the spike gene sequences of BCoV and HCoV-OC43 suggests a relatively recent zoonotic transmission event and dates their most recent common ancestor to around 1890. An evolutionary rate on the order of 4 × 10 -4 nucleotide changes per site per year was estimated.

2159,Organization and diversity of the 3' non-coding region of the classical swine fever virus genome,"Specific PCR primers were selected to amplify a 359 bp DNA fragment flanking the 3' part of the polymerase gene and the 3' non-coding region (3'-NC) of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) genome. ). In RT-PCR, the selected fragment was amplified from the genomes of 27 viral strains collected from Europe, America and Asia over a period of half a century, as well as from three CSFV vaccine strains. Eight PCR products were sequenced using an automated sequencing device. Nucleotide sequence analysis was performed using DNASTAR and PHYLIP software. Comparative studies revealed that the 3'-NC region contains a nucleotide variable region that lies immediately after the TGA or TAA stop codon. In addition, a strongly conserved constant region near the 3'-terminus was identified. Two imperfect repeat sequences were found in both the variable and constant regions. Furthermore, the variable region was characterized by the appearance of a 50 bp long poly AT track. Phylogenetic analysis with different mathematical approaches (MegAlign, neighbor joining method, maximum likelihood, parsimony) revealed that the studied CSFV strains clustered into two main phylogenetic groups. Group I was composed of the Brescia reference strain, together with old American and European field isolates and a Brazilian vaccine strain. Group II included the reference strain Alfort (Tubingen) and recent European field strains. The congenital tremor strain formed a distinct lineage that, although highly divergent, was more closely related to group I than to group II. In conclusion, the present phylogenetic grouping yielded very similar results to previous studies based on the comparison of the E2 region (gp55). The agreement of the phylogenetic analysis in the two distinct regions confirms the reliability of the genetic grouping of the CSFV strains into two main genogroups.",,"VilÄek, Å ;BelÃ¡k, S.",1997.0,,10.1023/a:1007971110065,0
2160,Genetic diversity of BVDV: Implications for classification and molecular epidemiology,"Genetic typing of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is important for the precise classification of viruses, as well as for the development of molecular epidemiology. Isolates of BVDV were generally typed based on comparison of the 5â€²-untranslated region (5â€²-UTR), Npro, and E2 genomic sequences. We have recently identified 11 genetic groups (subgenotypes) of BVDV-1. Our subsequent experiments confirmed a new subgenotype, BVDV-1k, isolated from cattle in Switzerland. BVDV isolates from India were typed as BVDV-1b, while BVDV-1c is a predominant subgenotype in Australia. The results of the genetic typing of BVDV indicate that the distribution of the subgenotypes is not related to the geographical origin of the viral isolates. © 2005 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Vilcek, S.;Durkovic, B.;Kolesarova, M.;Paton, D.

2161,Genetic diversity of recent bovine viral diarrhea viruses from southeastern Austria (Styria),"To characterize bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) isolates circulating in the southeastern region of Austria, i.e. in the province of Styria, 71 blood samples collected between 1998 and 2000 from persistently infected cattle were subjected to genetic typing. in 62 herds. For this, 288 bp fragments of the 5” untranslated region (5”-UTR) were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The products were sequenced and used for phylogenetic analysis. Seventy virus isolates were typed as BVDV species 1 (BVDV-1). Only one isolate was typed as BVDV species 2 (BVDV-2), representing the first isolate of this pestivirus genotype found in Austria. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis revealed that viruses belonging to five genetic groups within BVDV-1 circulate in Styria. Most of the viruses (53) were found in the BVDV-1f group, nine viruses in BVDV-1h, four viruses in BVDV-1b, three viruses in BVDV-1d and one virus in BVDV-1g. No virus was found in the BVDV-1a gene pool, which is dominant in the UK and widely distributed in the US. Also, the predominant BVDV isolates in a neighboring country, namely Germany, belonged to genogroups other than those circulating in Styria. We conclude that certain genetic groups of BVDV-1 predominate in a particular region and environment. New groups, including BVDV-2, can be introduced, for example, through the animal trade. The low incidence of BVDV-2 in Styria coincides with the sporadic appearance of these viruses in other regions of Europe. © 2002 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Vilcek, S.;Greiser-Wilke, I.;Durkovic, B.;Obritzhauser, W.;Deutz, A.;KÃ¶fer, J.",2003.0,,10.1016/s0378-1135(02)00296-1,0
2162,Molecular characterization of ovine pestiviruses,"Forty-two ovine pestivirus isolates, collected over a period of 18 years, were compared by phylogenetic analysis. The viruses were mostly field isolates from Great Britain; another two came from Sweden and two from New Zealand. RT-PCR products were obtained from two genomic regions, one within the 5' non-coding region (5'-NC) and the other encompassing parts of the p20 (N(pro)) and C coding regions. Sequencing Direct analysis of 5'-NC PCR products, followed by computer-aided phylogenetic analysis, divided ovine pestiviruses into three main genotypes. The results demonstrated that sheep can be naturally infected not only with border disease virus (BDV), but also with bovine viral diarrhea virus types I and II (BVDV). BDV isolates segregated into two main subtypes represented by the Moredun strain from Scotland and the 137/4 strain from England. The BVDV-I group was composed of three groups, two of them represented by the reference strains of BVDV NADL and Osloss, respectively, and the third by the ovine isolates D1120/1 and D1432/P. The grouping of ovine pestiviruses, based on the comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the 5'-NC region, was confirmed by the comparative analysis of the coding regions of p20 (NP(pro)) and C, performed both at the level of nucleotides as well as amino acids. . The presence of three genotypes in sheep, including BVDV-I and BVDV-II, indicates the inadequacy of the current nomenclature and classification of pestiviruses based on host species.",,"VilÄek, Å ;Nettleton, P.

2163,Genetic variability of classical swine fever virus,"The genetic variability of classical swine fever virus was studied by comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of 76 virus isolates collected over half a century on three continents. Parts of the E2 (gp55) and polymerase gene coding regions of the viral genome were amplified by RT-PCR and DNA fragments of 254 and 207 bp, respectively, were sequenced. Comparative sequence analysis of the E2 region revealed two main phylogenetic groups of CSFV, indicating that the virus apparently evolved from two ancestral nodes. Group I (represented by the Brescia strain) consisted of old and recent American and Asian viruses, as well as old English isolates from the 1950s. This group was subdivided into three subgroups, designated IA IC Group II (represented by the Alfort strain ) formed by relatively recent isolates from Europe, together with the Osaka strain, which was isolated in Japan from a pig of European origin. Based on genetic distances, the group was divided into subgroups II.A and II.B. Isolates from Malaysia fell into both groups, indicating multiple origins for contemporary outbreaks in that country. The ten vaccine strains analyzed were branched in group I, which implies a common ancestor. The Japanese Kanagawa strain, isolated in 1974, and the British Congenital Tremor strain from 1964 were the most distinct CSFV variants in our collection. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the polymerase coding region of 32 European strains distinguished subgroups II.A and II.B that were similar to the corresponding subgroups of the E2 phylogenetic tree. Therefore, the results revealed that the E2 region and the polymerase coding regions seem to be appropriate for grouping CSFV isolates from all over the world, distinguishing two major groups of the virus. The reliability of these regions for phylogenetic analysis is indicated by the similarity of the results obtained from the two separate parts of the CSFV genome.",,"VilÄek, Å ;Stadejek, T.;Ballagi-PordÃ¡ny, A.;Lowings, J.

2164,Diversity of hepatitis E virus genotype 3: phylogenetic analysis and presence of subtype 3b in wild boar in Europe,"An increasing number of autochthonous cases of hepatitis E caused by genotype 3 viruses (HEV-3) have been diagnosed throughout the world, especially in industrialized countries. Hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease and accumulating evidence indicates that domestic pigs and wild boar are the main reservoirs of HEV-3. A detailed analysis of HEV-3 subtypes could help determine the interplay of human activity, the role of animals as reservoirs, and interspecies transmission. Although full genome sequences are most appropriate for HEV subtyping, in most cases only partial genome sequences are available. Therefore, we carried out a subtype classification analysis, which uses regions of the three open reading frames of the genome. Using this approach, more than 1000 published HEV-3 isolates were subtyped. Partial HEV sequences freshly recovered from hunted German wild boar were also included in this study. These sequences were assigned to genotype 3 and clustered within subtype 3a, 3i and, unexpectedly, one of them within subtype 3b, a first non-human report of this subtype in Europe.",,"Vina-Rodriguez, A.;Schlosser, J.;Becher, D.;Kaden, V.;Groschup, M.

2165,Investigation of human cancers for retroviruses by low-stringency target enrichment and high-throughput sequencing,"Although almost a fifth of all human cancers have an infectious aetiology, the causes of most cancers remain unexplained. Despite the enormous data yield of automated high-throughput sequencing, viral DNA in a clinical sample typically makes up a proportion of host DNA that is too small to detect. Sequence variation among virus genomes complicates the application of highly sensitive and sequence-specific PCR methods. Therefore, our goal was to develop and characterize a method that allows sensitive detection of sequences despite considerable variation. We show that our low stringency solution hybridization method allows detection of <100 viral copies. Furthermore, distantly related proviral sequences can be enriched by orders of magnitude, allowing discovery of hitherto unknown viral sequences by high-throughput sequencing. The sensitivity was sufficient to detect retroviral sequences in clinical samples. We used this method to conduct an investigation of novel retroviruses in samples from three types of cancer. Consistent with recent studies, our investigation revealed no retroviral infections in human B-cell lymphoma cells, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or colorectal cancer biopsies. Nonetheless, our generally applicable method makes sensitive detection possible and allows sequencing of distantly related sequences from complex material.",,"Vinner, L.;Mourier, T.;Friis-Nielsen, J.;Gniadecki, R.;Dybkaer, K.;Rosenberg, J.;Langhoff, J.

2166,Nucleotide sequence analysis of the variable region of the VP2 gene of two isolates of infectious bursalitis virus from commercial poultry farms,"Two isolates of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) were obtained from commercial poultry farms with a history of serious outbreaks. A 474 bp product spanning the hypervariable region of the IBDV VP2 gene was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Nucleotide sequences of two isolates, VMB1 and VMB2, were determined and compared with those of twenty IBDV strains, including seven highly virulent, four classically virulent, four classically attenuated, three antigenic variants, and two serotype 2 avirulent strains. The two isolates showed a similarity of 96.5-98.4% with highly virulent strains, 84.6-94.6% with classic virulent strains, 90.0-91.4% with attenuated classic strains, 83.0- 91.9% with antigenic variants and 65.8-68.7% with avirulent strains. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two isolates showed amino acid substitutions of V256I, N279D, L294I and N299S, specific for highly virulent strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the two isolates, along with a reported highly virulent Indian strain, were closely related to highly virulent European, Japanese, and Chinese strains, indicating their evolutionary origin.",,"Viswas, K.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the pathogenicity, course of infection, virus kinetics, and aerosol transmission of PDCoV using 87 conventional piglets and their 9 mothers, including aerosol and contact controls to emulate field conditions. . Piglets at 2 to 4 days of age and their dams were administered an oronasal inoculum of PDCoV with a real-time reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR quantification cycle (Cq) value of 22 that was generated from from a field sample that had 100% nucleotide identity.

2168,Novel hemotropic mycoplasmas are widespread and genetically diverse in vampire bats,"Bats (Order: Chiroptera) have been extensively studied as reservoir hosts for viruses of interest to human and animal health. However, whether bats are equally competent hosts of non-viral pathogens such as bacteria remains an important open question. Here, we analyzed blood and saliva samples from vampire bats from Peru and Belize for hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (hemoplasmas), bacteria that can cause unapparent infection or anemia in hosts. Amplification of the 16S rRNA gene from blood showed that 67% (150/223) of common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) were infected with hemoplasmas. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed three new genotypes phylogenetically related but not identical to hemoplasmas described from other species of bats (non-vampires), rodents, humans, and non-human primates. The prevalence of hemoplasma in vampire bats was highest in non-breeding and young individuals, did not differ by country, and was relatively stable over time (ie, endemic). Metagenomics of pooled saliva of D. rotundus from Peru detected nonhemotropic mycoplasma species and hemoplasma genotypes phylogenetically similar to those identified in blood, providing indirect evidence for possible direct transmission of hemoplasmas through bites or social contacts. . This study demonstrates that vampire bats harbor several novel hemoplasmas and sheds light on risk factors for infection and basic routes of transmission. Given the high frequency of direct contacts that arise when vampire bats feed on humans, domestic animals, and wildlife, the potential for these bacteria to be transmitted between species should be investigated in future work.",,"Volokhov, D.

OBJECTIVES: We characterized the pulmonary changes in these fatal cases from Norway. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At the time of hospitalization, detailed clinical information and upper and lower respiratory tract samples were collected. At autopsy, lung tissue was collected, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemical and light microscopic examination was performed to visualize the local expression of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and pyrosequencing of unfixed samples allowed the identification of mutations in the influenza virus surface glycoprotein (hemagglutinin gene), particularly at position 222 RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The general course of the disease lasted from 2 to 40 days (median 9 days). Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was evident in 11 cases, 4 of whom had no apparent underlying disease. Obesity was prominent in 12 cases, where three individuals were classified as healthy. The HA D222G mutation was detected in six cases, 3 of whom had no underlying disease. Immunohistochemistry showed that A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was prominent at the site of inflammation, both near and within the alveolar structures of lung tissue. In addition to the possible role of the HA D222G mutation, our findings indicate that host factors and underlying conditions in infected individuals are critical to disease outcome in many cases.

2170,"99th Dahlem Conference on Infection, Inflammation and Chronic Inflammatory Disorders: Agricultural Lifestyles and the Hygiene Hypothesis","Some 15 years have passed since Strachan first proposed the idea that infections and unhygienic contact can confer protection against the development of allergic diseases. Since then, the so-called ""hygiene hypothesis"" has undergone numerous modifications in the fields of epidemiology, clinical science, and immunology. Three main areas of research have been presented: exploring the role of overt viral and bacterial infections in the initiation of allergic diseases; investigate the importance of environmental exposure to microbial compounds in the development of allergies; and to study the effect of both exposures on underlying innate and adaptive immune responses. No single concept has been found that unifies these various aspects, but several pieces of a complex interplay between host immune responses, characteristics of the invading organism, level and range of environmental exposure, and interactions between a host's genetic background exposed subject and the environmental exposures become apparent. A natural experiment related to the hygiene hypothesis is the recurring observation of the protective effect of growing up on a farm against asthma and allergies. This has been shown in a large number of epidemiological studies worldwide among children and adults. The timing and duration of exposure are likely to play a major role. The greatest risk reduction has been shown for people exposed before birth and continuously into adulthood. The protective factors in these agricultural settings have not been fully unraveled. Findings from several studies suggest that contact with farm animals, at least in childhood, confers protection. Consuming raw cow's milk straight from the farm has also been shown to protect against childhood asthma and allergies. Increased levels of microbial substances may, at least in part, contribute to the 'farm effect'. However, only a few studies have measured microbial exposures in these settings and the results obtained so far suggest that the underlying protective microbial exposures have not been identified, but several studies using metagenomic approaches are currently underway. The mechanisms by which such environmental exposures confer protection against respiratory allergies are also poorly understood. There is good evidence for the involvement of innate immune responses, but translation into protective mechanisms for asthma and allergies is lacking. In addition, several gene x environment interactions have been observed. © 2010 British Society for Immunology.",,"Von Mutius, E.",2010.0,,10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04138.x,0
2171,The possible role played by the buffalo in the recent outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in South Africa,"The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) acts as a maintenance host for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in southern Africa. A single buffalo can become infected with all three endemic FMD virus serotypes (SAT-1, SAT-2 and SAT-3) and pose an infection threat to other susceptible cloven-hoofed animals. The 2000 floods in southern Africa extensively damaged the Kruger National Park (KNP) game fence, and there were several accounts of buffalo having escaped from the park. The VP1 gene, which encodes the major antigenic determinant of FMD virus, was used to determine the phylogenetic relationships between virus isolates obtained from outbreaks and those previously obtained from buffalo in the KNP. These results demonstrate that buffalo were likely the source of the outbreaks, indicating that disease control through the use of fencing and vaccination is extremely important to ensure that FMD does not become established in domestic livestock.",,"Vosloo, W.;Boshoff, K.;Dwarka, R.;Bastos, A.",2002.0,,,0

A virulent form of IBDV arrived in South Africa in 1989 and to date little molecular information has been available for this strain. In this study, the polyprotein coding region of the South African strain SA-KZN95 was sequenced and analyzed together with 52 representative sequences from other serotype I and II strains. We explore the relative impact of recombination on phylogenetic reconstruction using a multidimensional scaling approach. Phylogenetic analyzes consistently placed the South African isolate within the highly virulent IBDV clade. Screening analyzes were also performed to identify evolutionarily relevant amino acid residues. Previously, 19 residues in the polyprotein were shown to be potentially diagnostic for the different pathotypes of IBDV. This study identified two additional unique residues in the polyprotein that can be used as genetic signatures in future viral identifications.

After subcloning into the Eco RI site of pBR322 and propagation, both strands of the insert were sequenced using a shotgun strategy. Starting with the first start codon, which was immediately preceded by a GC-rich region including four overlapping CCGCC consensus sequences, an open reading frame for a 302 amino acid polypeptide was resolved. This peptide had an M(r) of 33,827, started with methionine and ended with serine. The identity of the isolated cDNA was confirmed by comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the resolved sequences of the bovine spermidine synthase tryptic peptides. The coding strand of the cDNA revealed no special ribosome binding or regulatory signals within 82 nucleotides preceding the start codon and no polyadenylation signal within 247 nucleotides following the stop codon. The coding region, which contained a 13-nucleotide repeat near the 5' end, was longer than and very different from that of the bacterial counterpart. This region appears to be of retroviral origin and shows marked homology to sequences found in a variety of human, mammalian, avian, and viral genes and mRNAs. By computer analysis, the first 200 nucleotides at the 5' end of the coding strand appear capable of forming a very stable secondary structure with a free energy change of -157.6 kcal/mol.

In this study, field studies were conducted in the western highlands of Kenya with symptomatic viral leaf samples collected. Subsequently, next-generation sequencing was carried out to gain insight into the molecular evolution and evolutionary relationships of bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV) and cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CABMV) present. in symptomatic common bean and cowpea. Eleven near-complete BCMNV and two CABMV genomes were obtained from western Kenya. Bayesian phylogenomic analyzes and differential selection pressure tests within sites and between branches of the viral genome trees were carried out. Three well-supported clades in BCMNV and one clade supported in CABMNV were resolved and according to individual gene trees. Analysis of selection pressure within sites and between phylogenetic branches suggested that both viruses evolved independently, but under strong purifying selection, with a slow evolutionary rate. These findings provide valuable insights into the evolution of the BCMNV and CABMV genomes and their relationship to other viral genomes globally. The results will greatly contribute to the knowledge gap involving the phylogenomic relatedness of these viruses, particularly for CABMV, for which few genomic sequences are available, and will inform current breeding efforts toward resistance to BCMNV and CABMV.",,"Wainaina, J.

PROCEDURE: Two challenge isolates of MDV (MPF57 or MPF23) were administered to unvaccinated specific pathogen free (SPF) laying chicks on day 5 after hatch in three challenge doses (500, 2000 or 8000 plaque-forming units ( pfu)/chick). Mortality, body weight, immune organ weight, MDV load on peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), and clinical signs were measured up to 56 days post-challenge (dpc). RESULTS: MPF23 was the more pathogenic of the two viruses, inducing higher mortality (81% vs. 62%) and incidence of MD lesions (100% vs. 76%). MPF23 induced earlier, more sustained and more severe neurological signs in the period 26-56 dpc. However, there were few differences during the 0-23 dpc used in the neuropathotyping classification under test. The pattern observed during this earlier period classified both viruses as neuropathotype B, consistent with a highly virulent pathotype. MDV load in PBL at 7 and 44 dpc did not differ between virus isolates, but load at 7 dpc was significantly and negatively associated with time to euthanasia or death. CONCLUSION: MPF23 appears to be as virulent as or more virulent than MDV strains isolated over the next two decades. The neuropathotyping system developed in the US did not clearly differentiate between the two isolates under test; however, the extension of the clinical signs evaluation period beyond 26 dpc did reveal clear differences.",,"Wajid, S.

We describe the genome sequences of 11 poorly characterized nairoviruses that have ecological associations with birds (Farallon, Punta Salinas, Sapphire II, Zirqa, Avalon, Clo Mor, Taggert, and Abu Hammad viruses), rodents (Qalyub and Bandia viruses), or camels Dera Ghazi Khan). Global phylogenetic analyzes of proteins encoded in the L, M, and S RNA segments of these and 20 other available nairovirus genomes identified nine well-supported genogroups (Nairobi, Thiafora, Sakhalin, Keterah, Qalyub, Kasokero, Dera Ghazi sheep disease Khan, Hughes, and Tamdy). Genogroup-specific structural variations were evident, particularly in the M segment that encodes a polyprotein from which virion envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) are generated by proteolytic processing. Structural variations include extension, abbreviation, or absence sequences encoding an O-glycosylated mucin-like protein in the N-terminal domain, distinctive patterns of conserved cysteine residues in the GP38-like domain, insertion of sequences encoding a double membrane protein. (NSm) between the Gn and Gc domains, and the presence of an alternative long open reading frame encoding a viroporin-like (Gx) transmembrane protein. We also observed strong genogroup-specific associations with host categories and tick vectors.",,"Walker, P. J.;Widen, S. G.;Wood, T. G.;Guzman, H.;Tesh, R.

2180,The history of bluetongue and a current global vision,"Bluetongue (BT) was first reported more than 125 years ago when European sheep breeds were introduced to southern Africa. BT viruses (BTV) have been identified in many tropical and temperate areas of the world. BT, the disease, is a phenomenon of ruminants in temperate zones. There is little clinical disease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. At least 24 serotypes of BTV have been described. Although viruses are antigenically and taxonomically classified as BTV, each serotype is unique and may not cause BT, the disease. BTVs are transmitted between ruminants by competent vector species of the genus Culicoides, ie biting midges or gnats. BTV serotypes with Culicoides vector species exist in predictable, but finite, geographic and ecological cycles or ecosystems throughout the world. Despite the almost certain movement of livestock and Culicoides species between these ecosystems, there is little evidence that introduced BTV serotypes have become established in these ecosystems. Rather, the periodic cyclical extensions and remissions of these virus vector ecosystems allow viruses and disease to move back and forth from adjacent non-endemic areas in a pattern characteristic of many other known arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Previous publications suggested that a carrier state occurred in cattle infected as fetuses with BTV. No subsequent natural experience or research supports the hypothesis that has not been validated. The conclusions of the investigation are not accepted by the scientific community. It is logical, therefore, to propose that regulatory restrictions against the movement of cattle from countries affected by BTV be relaxed or eliminated.",,"Walton, T. E.",2004.0,Jul-Sep,,0
2181,Detection of African Swine Fever Virus-Like Sequences in Mississippi Delta Ponds Using Metagenomic Sequencing,"Metagenomic characterization of the water virome was performed in four Mississippi catfish ponds. Although they differ considerably from African swine fever virus (ASFV), 48 of 446,100 sequences from 12 samples were similar enough to indicate that they represent new members of the Asfarviridae family. ASFV is currently the only member of the Asfarviridae, and this study presents the first indication of a similar virus in North America. At this point, there is no indication that the identified viruses pose a threat to human or animal health, and further studies are needed to characterize their potential risks to both public health and agricultural development. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"Wan, X.

2183,Identification of novel and differentially expressed microRNAs in goat enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma,"Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) posttranscriptionally regulate a variety of genes involved in eukaryotic cell growth, development, metabolism, and other biological processes, and numerous miRNAs are implicated in cancer initiation and progression. Enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma (ENA), an epithelial tumor induced in goats and sheep by enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV), is a chronic, progressive, contact-transmitted disease. Methods: In this work, Illumina high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs was used to construct a goat nasal miRNA library. This study aimed to identify novel and differentially expressed miRNAs in the nasal tumor and paracarcinoma tissues of Nanjiang yellow goats with ENA. Results: 406 known miRNAs and 29 novel miRNAs were identified. A total of 116 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in paracarcinoma and ENA nasal tissues (54 downregulated; 60 upregulated; two only expressed in the control group); Target gene prediction and functional analysis revealed that 6176 target genes with no redundancy, 1792 significant GOs, and 97 significant KEGG pathways were predicted for 121 miRNAs (116 miRNAs of significant expression and five-star sequence). Analysis of the GO and KEGG pathways revealed that most of the target genes in ENA are involved in cell proliferation, signal transduction, and other processes associated with cancer. Conclusions: This is the first large-scale identification of miRNAs in Capra hircus ENA and provides a theoretical basis for investigating the complicated miRNA-mediated regulatory networks involved in the pathogenesis and progression of ENA.",,"Wang, B.;Ye, N.;Cao, S.

2184,Microbial phylogeny determines the transcriptional response of the resistome to dynamic composting processes,"BACKGROUND: Animal manure is a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) that represent a potential risk to health worldwide, especially due to resistance to antibiotics commonly used in livestock production (such as tetracycline, sulfonamide and the fluoroquinolone). Currently, the effects of biological treatment (composting) on the transcriptional response of ARGs from manure and their microbial hosts are not well characterized. Composting is a dynamic process consisting of four distinct phases distinguished by the resulting temperature of microbial activity, namely the mesophilic, thermophilic, cooling and maturation phases. In this study, changes in resistome expression were determined and related to active microbiome profiles during the dynamic composting process. This was achieved by integrating metagenomic and metatranscriptomic time series data for the evolving microbial community during composting. RESULTS: Composting markedly reduced the level of aggregate expression of the manure resistome, which consisted primarily of genes encoding resistance to tetracycline, vancomycin, fluoroquinolone, beta-lactams, and aminoglycosides, as well as efflux pumps. In addition, a varied transcriptional response of the resistome to composting at ARG levels was highlighted. Expression of tetracycline resistance genes (tetM-tetW-tetO-tetS) decreased during composting, where distinctive changes in the four composting phases were related to variations in antibiotic concentration. Composting had no effect on the expression of genes for resistance to sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones, which increased slightly during the thermophilic phase and then decreased to baseline levels. As indigenous populations changed greatly throughout dynamic composting, the core resistome persisted, and the composition of its reservoir hosts correlated significantly with dynamic active microbial phylogenetic structure. The sulfonamide and fluoroquinolone resistance gene hosts changed markedly in their phylogenetic structure, experiencing an initial increase and then a decrease in abundance. In contrast, hosts of tetracycline resistance genes (tetM-tetW-tetO-tetS) exhibited a steady decline over time. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptional patterns of a core resistome over the course of composting were identified, and microbial phylogeny was the key determinant in defining the varied transcriptional response of the resistome to this dynamic biological process. This research demonstrated the benefits of composting for manure treatment. It reduced the risk of emerging environmental contaminants, such as tetracyclines, tetracycline resistance genes, and clinically relevant ARG-carrying pathogens, as well as RNA viruses and bacteriophages.",,"Wang, C.;Dong, D.;Strong, P.

To clarify the virus spectrum of mild and severe HFMD, a full virome analysis of 238 samples was performed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The data revealed a total of thirteen mammalian and plant virus families and diverse viral populations, including enteroviruses, common respiratory viruses, diarrhoea-related viruses, plant viruses, and anelloviruses. A total of 18 viruses from 7 virus families were identified in severe cases, versus 37 viruses from 12 virus families in mild cases. Furthermore, complicated mixed infections of enteroviruses with common respiratory viruses were found mainly in severe cases (P = 0.013), while diarrhea-related viruses were found mainly in mild cases (P < 0.001). This study provides a preliminary understanding of virome in both mild and severe cases, which may benefit detection of etiologic agents and prevention of HFMD.",,"Wang, C.;Zhou, S.;Xue, W.;Shen, L.;Huang, W.;Zhang, Y.;Li, X.;Wang, J.;Zhang, H.;Ma, X.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.virol.2018.02.004,0

2189,Identification of progenitors of avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses from Indonesia and South China Vietnam,"Transmission of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus to countries in Southeast Asia triggered the first major outbreak and wave of transmission in late 2003, accelerating the pandemic threat to the world. Due to the lack of influenza surveillance prior to these outbreaks, the genetic diversity and transmission routes of H5N1 viruses from this period remain undefined. To determine the possible source of the H5N1 wave 1 viruses, we recently performed additional sequencing and analysis of samples collected from live bird markets in Guangdong, Hunan, and Yunnan in southern China between 2001 and 2004. Phylogenetic analysis of genes hemagglutinin and neuraminidase assays of 73 H5N1 isolates from this period revealed greater genetic diversity in southern China than previously reported. In addition, the results show that eight viruses isolated from Yunnan in 2002 and 2003 were more closely related to clade 1 virus sublineage from Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, while two viruses from Hunan in 2002 and 2003 were more closely related to viruses. from Indonesia (clade 2.1). Additional phylogenetic analyzes of the six internal genes showed that all 10 viruses maintained similar phylogenetic relationships to those of the surface genes. All 10 parent viruses were of genotype Z and shared high similarity (≥99%) with their corresponding daughter viruses in most genetic segments. These results suggest a direct transmission link of H5N1 viruses between Yunnan and Vietnam and also between Hunan and Indonesia during 2002 and 2003. The poultry trade may be responsible for the introduction of the virus into Vietnam, while the route of transmission from Hunan to Indonesia remains unclear.

2190,Transcriptomic analysis identifies candidate genes and gene sets that control the response of porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells to poly I:C stimulation,"Polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthetic dsRNA analog, has been shown to have stimulatory effects similar to those of viral dsRNA. To gain an in-depth understanding of the host transcriptional response of pigs to poly I:C stimulation, in the present study, we cultured and stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from piglets of an indigenous Chinese breed (Dapulian) and a modern commercial strain (Landrace) with poly I:C, and compared its transcriptional profile by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Our results indicated that poly I:C stimulation can elicit significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes in Dapulian (g = 290) as well as Landrace (g = 85). We also performed gene set analysis using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) package and identified some significantly enriched gene sets in Dapulian (g = 18) and Landrace (g = 21). Most of the shared DE genes and gene sets were related to the immune system and may play crucial rules in the immune response of poly I:C stimulation. In addition, we detected significantly large DE gene sets and enriched gene sets by comparing the gene expression profile between the two breeds, including control and poly I:C stimulation groups. In addition to immunity-related functions, some of the DE genes and gene pools between the two breeds were involved in the development and growth of various tissues, which may be related to the different characteristics of the two breeds. The DE genes and gene sets detected here provide crucial information for understanding the immune regulation of antiviral responses and the molecular mechanisms of different genetic resistances to viral infection, in modern and indigenous pigs.",,"Wang, J.;Wang, Y.;Wang, H.;Wang, H.;Liu, J.

2191,Characterization of emerging Newcastle disease virus isolates in China,"Abstract Background: Newcastle disease (ND) is a devastating worldwide disease of poultry characterized by increased respiration, circulatory disorders, haemorrhagic enteritis and nervous signs. Sequence analysis shows several amino acid residue substitutions in neutralizing epitopes in the F and HN proteins of recent Shaanxi strains. Both cross-protection and cross-serum neutralization tests revealed that traditional vaccine strains could not provide complete protection to flocks. Methods: To better understand the epidemiology of the Newcastle disease outbreak, a part of the F gene and full-length HN gene were amplified from isolates from Shaanxi by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ) and then sequence and phylogenetic analyzes were performed. In the pathogenicity analysis, high intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and chick embryo mean death time (MDT) tests were performed. In addition, a cross-protection experiment was also performed in which specific pathogen-free chickens vaccinated with a LaSota vaccine strain were challenged by the fresh Shaanxi strain. Results: Nine Newcastle disease virus (ND) isolates (NDV) recovered from ND outbreaks in chicken flocks in China were characterized genotypically and pathotypically. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that all recent Shaanxi NDV isolates have <sup>112</sup>RRQKRF<sup>117</sup> for the C-terminus of the F2 protein and exhibit elevated ICPI and MDT from embryos of chicken, suggesting that all were classified as velogenic type of NDV. Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates showed that they belong to the VIId subgenotype that has been implicated in the recent outbreaks in northwestern China. The percent amino acid sequence identity of the F protein between the fresh Shaanxi stains and the five vaccine strains was in the range of 81.9%-88.1%, while the percent amino acid sequence identity of HN protein between recent Shaanxi strains and vaccine strains was in the range of 81.9%-88.1%. range 87.4%-91.2%. In addition, several amino acid residue substitutions were observed in the neutralizing epitopes on the F and HN proteins of these isolates, which may lead to the change of antibody recognition and neutralizing ability. A cross-protection experiment indicated that specific pathogen free chickens vaccinated with a LaSota vaccine strain were not able to provide complete protection to flocks that were challenged by the recent Shaanxi strain. Conclusions: Taken together, our findings reveal that recent NDV strains from Shannxi exhibit antigenic variations that could be responsible for the recent NDV outbreaks in northwest China.",,"Wang, J.

Phylogenetic analysis based on VP1 sequences demonstrated three distinct genetic groups. There was excellent concordance between the genetic groups assigned based on the full VP0, VP3, and partial 3D regions. In view of the growing importance of molecular techniques in diagnosis, we propose that the three genetic groups be named DHV types A, B and C. All DHV-1 strains grouped into genotype A, while new strains of serotypes isolated in Taiwan and the new serotype strains isolated in South Korea clustered into genotypes B and C, respectively, suggesting potential genetic correlates of the serotype. In pairwise comparisons of the complete VP1, VP0, and VP3 nucleotide and amino acid sequences and the partial 3D nucleotide sequence, DHVs of the same genotype were clearly distinguished from those of heterologous genotypes.

2195,Characterization of miRNAs involved in the response to poly(I:C) in porcine airway epithelial cells,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, including infectious diseases. The knowledge of miRNAs affected by poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded viral RNA, in porcine airway epithelial cells (PAEC) contributes to understanding the mechanisms of porcine viral respiratory diseases, which every year they generate enormous economic losses all over the world. . In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to profile miRNA expression in poly(I:C)-treated PAEC compared to untreated control. This approach revealed 23 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), five of which had not previously been implicated in viral infections. Nineteen of the 23 miRNAs were downregulated, including members of the miR-17-92 group, a well-known polycistronic oncomir widely involved in viral infection in humans. DEM target genes, predicted by bioinformatics and validated by analysis of luciferase reporters in two representative DEMs, were significantly enriched in several pathways, including transforming growth factor-β signaling. A large number of sequence variations (isomiR) were found, including a substitution at position 5, which was verified to redirect miRNAs to a new spectrum of targets by luciferase reporter assay in conjunction with bioinformatic analysis. Twelve new porcine miRNAs conserved in other species were identified by homology analysis in conjunction with cloning verification. Furthermore, expression analysis revealed the potential importance of three new miRNAs in the porcine immune response to viruses.

Those viruses contribute significantly to respiratory and digestive disorders in humans and animals. Of the 9 species of enteroviruses, EG enteroviruses are closely related to diseases that affect the livestock industry. While enterovirus infection has been increasingly reported in cattle and pigs, enterovirus infections in small ruminants remain largely unknown. Methods Virological, molecular and bioinformatic methods were used to characterize a new enterovirus CEV-JL14 from goats showing severe diarrhea with morbidity and mortality respectively up to 84% and 54% in China. Results CEV-JL14 was defined and proposed as a new species L of Enterovirus within the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. CEV-JL14 had a complete genomic sequence of 7,461 nucleotides with an ORF encoding 2,172 amino acids and shared 77.1% genomic sequence identity with TB4-OEV, an ovine enterovirus. Comparison of 5'-UTR and structural genes of CEV-JL14 with known Enterovirus species revealed high genetic variations between CEV-JL14 with known Enterovirus species. The nucleotide sequence identities of CEV-14 VP1 were 51.8% to 53.5% with those of enteroviruses E and F, 30.9% to 65.3% with enteroviruses G, and 43. 8 to 51. 5% with Enterovirus AD, respectively. CEV-JL14 was proposed as a new species within the genus Enterovirus according to the current ICTV enterovirus demarcation criteria. Conclusions CEV-JL14 is not grouped phylogenetically in Enterovirus E and F, nor in Enterovirus G. It was defined and proposed as a new species L within the genus Enterovirus.

We found that the relative abundance of ARG in bacterial DNA in all water samples was significantly higher than that in phage DNA (>10.6-fold), and wastewater treatment did not significantly change the relative abundance of ARG associated with bacteria or phages. In addition, we detected the distribution and diversity of the different types of ARGs according to the class of antibiotics to which they confer resistance, tetracycline resistance genes were the most abundant resistance genes, and phages were more likely to harbor the family of transporters. ATP-binding and ribosomal cassettes. protection genes. Furthermore, the colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was also detected in the phage population. When evaluating the contribution of phages in the spread of different ARG pools, β-lactamase resistance genes had relatively high spreadability, although abundance was low. These findings possibly indicated that phages could not only serve as an important reservoir of ARGs, but also transport particular ARGs in pig feedlot wastewater, and this phenomenon is independent of the environment.",,"Wang, M.;Xiong, W.;Liu, P.;Xie, X.;Zeng, J.;Sun, Y.;Zeng, Z.",2018.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2018.02474,0

To further our understanding of transposable phage in P. aeruginosa, we have sequenced the entire genome of D3112. The genome is 37,611 bp, with an overall G+C content of 65%. We have identified 53 potential open reading frames, including three genes (the repressor gene c and the early genes A and B) that have been previously characterized and sequenced. The organization of the putative coding regions corresponds to published genetic and transcriptional maps and is very similar to that of enterobacteriophage Mu. In contrast, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has classified D3112 as a lambda-like phage on the basis of its morphology. Similarity-based analyzes identified 27 open reading frames with significant matches to proteins in the NCBI databases. Forty-eight percent of these were similar to Mu-like phage and prophage sequences, including proteins responsible for transposition, transcriptional regulation, virion morphogenesis, and capsid formation. The tail proteins were very similar to sequences from the Escherichia coli prophage and Staphylococcus aureus phage Phi12, while the rightmost proteins were very similar to the Xylella fastidiosa proteins. We performed phylogenetic analyzes to understand the evolutionary relationships of D3112 to Mu-like bacteriophages versus lambda-like bacteriophages. In some cases, different results were obtained from similarity-based versus phylogenetic analyses. Overall, our findings reveal a highly mosaic structure and suggest that extensive horizontal exchange of genetic material played an important role in the evolution of D3112.",,"Wang, P.

All RT-PCR amplified products from 12 strains in the study had the same size of 224 bp. By comparing 12 sequences with 9 other sequences from previously reported reference strains using the DNAstar software, it was found that hog cholera virus could be classified into two groups by phylogenetic tree analysis. Brescia, Gpe, Ald, Thiverval, C, CW, HCLV, HCVSM, BJCY1/96, BJTX3/96, BJSY2/96, HeNXH2/98, HeNZZ1/82, and GDGZ1/95 strains were assigned to group A and accounted for 85.7% - 100% for the nucleotide sequence and 83.8%-100% for the amino acid sequence in homology; but HCVF98, HCVF94, HeBHH2/95, LN1/84, SZGM1/85, SCCD1/79 and Alfort strains were assigned to group B and were 84.3% to 100% for nucleotide sequence and 85.1% 100% for amino acid sequence homology. ; and 21 HCV strains had 78.1%-100% nucleotide sequence and 78.4%-100% amino acid sequence homology. The homology was 99.1% for the nucleotide sequence and 100% for the amino acid sequence between the HCLV strains in our study and the C strains reported by Rijn's in the Netherlands. It has shown that our sequencing method is reliable. There were obvious differences between the two groups in the sequences of the major E2 envelope glycoprotein gene, especially in amino acid substitutions at sites 713 and 729 respectively, and it was shown that the two groups of HCV field strains could vary. genetically to some extent.

2201,Norovirus and sapovirus prevalence in pigs of various ages determined by reverse transcription PCR and microwell hybridization assays,"Noroviruses (NoV) and sapoviruses (SaV) are emerging enteric pathogens that cause diarrhea in humans and animals. Porcine genogroup II (GII) NoVs replicate in pigs, but their pathogenesis is undefined. The swine strain SaV/GIII/Cowden/80/US causes diarrhea and intestinal lesions in pigs. Recently, genetically diverse porcine NoVs (genotypes 11, 18, and 19 within GII) and SaVs comprising at least two genogroups (GIII and GVI?/JJ681-like) and two unclassified strains (G?/QW19 and G?/LL26 ) were identified; however, its prevalence has not been reported. To investigate the prevalence of swine NoV and SaV, 621 fecal samples were collected from pigs of various ages from seven pig farms and one slaughterhouse in three US states. Fecal samples were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and microwell hybridization assays with porcine NoV- and SaV-specific primers and probes, respectively. Porcine NoV GIIs were detected exclusively in finishing pigs with an overall prevalence of 20%. Porcine SaV GIII were detected in 62% of pigs, with the highest prevalence in post-weaning piglets and the lowest in suckling piglets. Porcine GVI?/JJ681-like SaVs and G?/QW19-like SaVs were infrequently detected in pigs. G?/LL26-like SaVs were mainly detected in younger pigs. Because some porcine NoV and SaV are genetically or antigenically related to human strains and recombinants within NoV or SaV occur in both human and porcine strains, the high prevalence and subclinical infection rate of these viruses in pigs raise questions about whether pigs can be reservoirs of human strains. or for the appearance of new human and porcine recombinants.

2203,Calculation of the evolutionary correlation between individual genes and the whole genome: a useful method to choose phylogenetic markers for molecular epidemiology,"Single genes or regions are still commonly used to estimate phylogenetic relationships among viral isolates. Genomic regions that can reliably provide scores consistent with those predicted with full genome sequences would be preferred to serve as good candidate phylogenetic markers for molecular epidemiological studies of many viruses. Here we employ a statistical method to assess the evolutionary relationships between individual viral genes and entire genomes without tree construction as a way to determine which gene can match the genome well in phylogenetic analyses. This method was performed by calculating linear correlations between the genetic distance matrices of aligned individual gene sequences and aligned genome sequences. We applied this method to phylogenetic analyzes of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), measles virus (MV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Phylogenetic trees were constructed for comparisons and possible factors affecting the accuracy of the method were also discussed in the calculations. The results revealed that this method could produce results consistent with those of previous studies on suitable consensus sequences that could be successfully used as phylogenetic markers. And our results also suggested that these evolutionary correlations could provide useful information for identifying genes that could be used effectively to infer genetic relationships.

2204,Codon usage preference analysis in hemagglutinin genes of influenza A (H1N1) virus of porcine origin,"Background Influenza A(H1N1) virus of swine origin (S-OIV) has come to the fore since 2009 and was identified as a new reassortant strain. The hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein mediates virus attachment, contains antigenic regions recognized by neutralizing antibodies, and is associated with infection and adaptation between viral species. The comparison study of codon usage preferences in influenza viral genomes was less extensive. In this study, we used codon usage pattern analysis to validate the adaptation and origins of S-OIV. Methods The codon usage pattern was used to estimate the host adaptation of S-OIV. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene was performed to understand the phylogeny of H1N1 viruses isolated from different hosts. The characteristic pattern of amino acids at the antigenic sites of HA was analyzed to understand the antigenic features. Results The results of the phylogenetic analyzes of the HA gene indicate that the S-OIVs cluster in identical groups. Synonymous codon usage pattern analyzes indicate that the effective codon number versus GC content at the third codon position in the HA1 gene differs slightly from that of porcine H1N1 and gradually adapts to humans. Our data indicate that the evolution of S-OIV occurred in accordance with positive selection within these antigenic regions. A comparison of antigenic site amino acids reveals similar characteristic patterns between S-OIV and 1918 human influenza strains. Conclusion This study proposes a novel and effective way to gain a better understanding of S-OIV genome characteristics and evolutionary processes. based on the pattern of codon usage. It is useful in tracing the origins of the influenza virus and the transmission of the virus between species.",,"Wang, S. F.;Su, M. W.;Tseng, S. P.;Li, M. C.;Tsao, C. H.;Huang, S. W.;Chu, W.

2205,"Divergent Pathogenic Properties of Circulating Coxsackievirus A6 Associated with Emerging Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease","Coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) is an emerging pathogen associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Its genetic characterization and pathogenic properties are largely unknown. Here, we report 39 circulating CV-A6 strains isolated in 2013 from HFMD patients in Northeast China. Three major groups of CV-A6 were identified and related to CV-A6, mainly from Shanghai, indicating that domestic strains of CV-A6 were responsible for the emergence of HFMD in Northeast China. Four full-length CV-A6 genomes representing each cluster were sequenced and further analyzed. Bootscanning tests indicated that the four strains of CV-A6-Changchun were probably recombinants between the prototype CV-A6 Gdula and the prototype virus CV-A4 or related to CV-A4, while the pattern of recombination was related to strains, but different from them. isolated from other regions of China. Furthermore, different strains of CV-A6 showed different capacities for viral replication, release, and pathogenesis in a mouse model. Further analyzes indicated that the viral protein 2C contributed to the diverse pathogenic capabilities of CV-A6 by causing autophagy and inducing cell death. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report lethal and nonlethal strains of CV-A6 associated with HFMD. The 2C protein region may play a key role in the pathogenicity of CV-A6 strains.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a major threat and persistent for babies and children. In addition to the more common pathogens such as enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), other enteroviruses are increasingly contributing to HFMD. The present study focused on the recently emerged CV-A6 strain. We found that CV-A6 strains isolated in Changchun City, Northeast China, were associated with domestic origins. These Changchun viruses were new prototype CV-A6 Gdula and CV-A4 recombinants. Our results imply that measures to control CV-A6 transmission are urgently needed. Further analysis revealed different pathogenicities in strains isolated in a neonatal mouse model. One of the possible causes has been narrowed down to the viral protein 2C, using phylogenetic studies, viral sequences, and direct tests on cultured human cells. Therefore, the viral protein 2C is a promising target for antiviral drugs to prevent CV-A6-induced tissue damage.",,"Wang, S. H.;Wang, A.;Liu, P. P.;Zhang, W. Y.;Du, J.;Xu, S.;Liu, G. C.;Zheng, B.

2206,Discovery of a highly divergent coronavirus in the Asian house shrew from China illuminates the origin of alphacoronaviruses,"Although shrews are one of the largest groups of mammals, little is known about their role in the evolution and transmission of viral pathogens, including coronaviruses. We captured 266 Asian domestic shrews (Suncus murinus) in Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces, China, during 2013-2015. Coronavirus (CoV) RNA was detected in 24 Asian house shrews, with an overall prevalence of 9.02%. Complete viral genome sequences were successfully recovered from RNA-positive samples. The newly discovered CoV shrew split into four lineages reflecting their geographic origins, indicating largely allopatric evolution. Notably, these viruses were most closely related to the alphacoronaviruses, but divergent enough to be considered a new member of the Alphacoronavirus genus, which we call Wencheng shrew virus (WESV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WESV was a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and, more dramatically, that the WESV S gene was in a group that was genetically distinct from known coronaviruses. The divergent position of WESV suggests that coronaviruses have a long association with Asian house shrews. Furthermore, the WESV genome contains a distinct NS7 gene that has no sequence similarity to any known virus. Together, these data suggest that shrews are natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and may have played an important and long-term role in the evolution of CoV.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The subfamily Coronavirinae contains several notorious human and animal pathogens, including those severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Due to their genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships, it has been proposed that alphacoronaviruses most likely have their last ancestor in viruses residing in bats. Here, we describe a new alphacoronavirus (Wencheng shrew virus, WESV) that was sampled from Asian domestic shrews in China. In particular, WESV is a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and possesses an S gene that is genetically distinct from all known coronaviruses. Furthermore, the WESV genome contains a distinct NS7 gene that has no sequence similarity to any known virus. Together, these data suggest that shrews are important and long-standing hosts of coronaviruses that warrant further investigation and surveillance.",,"Wang, W.;Lin, X. D.;Liao, Y.;Guan, X.

2207,Evidence of avian influenza Clade 7.1 (H5N1) virus in Qinghai Lake,"The highly pathogenic influenza A virus subtype H5N1 has spread throughout Asia since 2003, reached Europe in 2005, the Middle East and Africa, and has caused global concern of a possible pandemic threat in the past decade. A Clade 2.3.2 H5N1 virus became dominant in the Qinghai Lake region in 2009 with sporadic cases of infection in mammals and was transferred to Russia and Europe via wild migratory birds. Currently, HPAI H5N1 from clades 2.3.4, 2.3.2, and 7 are the dominant co-circulating H5N1 viruses in poultry in Asia. 2.3.2 The clade is dominant in wild birds worldwide, while there are no clear data on the circulation of clade 7 in wild birds. We detected Clade 7.1 HPAI H5N1 virus in Qinghai Lake, which is closely related to the Shanxi and Vietnam-like viruses co-circulating in poultry. This is the first report of Clade 7.1 H5N1 in wild birds. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the virus may originate from the Clade 7.1 virus gene pool that spread in poultry in Vietnam and China and could spread with migratory birds to Qinghai Lake. Qinghai Lake continues to be an important hotspot for H5N1 virus surveillance, as regular outbreaks in wild birds and mammals have occurred there. Based on these facts and findings, related researchers should pay more attention to the Qinghai Lake Basin as an important hotspot for H5N1 avian influenza surveillance, as regular H5N1 outbreaks occurred there in wild birds with sporadic cases. of infection in mammals.",,"Wang, W.;Sharshov, K.;Li, Z.;Zheng, S.

2208,Genetic characterization of a new picornavirus of duck origin with six 2A proteins,"new virus from diseased ducks was detected and fully determined. The virus was shown to have a similar genome design to picornavirus. Interestingly, the genome contained a total of up to six 2As, including four 2As (2A1–2A4), each with an NPGP motif, one AIG1-like 2A5, and one parechovirus-like 2A6. The 5-UTR was predicted to possess a hepacivirus/pestivirus-like internal ribosome entry site (IRES). However, the IIIe subdomain consisted of a 3 nt stem and five unpaired bases, distinct from those found in all other HP-like IRES. The virus was most closely related to duck hepatitis A virus, with amino acid identities of 37.7%, 39%, and 43.7% in the P1, P2, and P3 regions, respectively. On the basis of these investigations, together with phylogenetic analyses, the virus could be considered as the founding member of a new genus of picornaviruses that we tentatively call 'Aalivirus', with 'Aalivirus A' as the type species.",,"Wang, X.;Liu, N.;Wang, F.;Ning, K.;Li, Y.;Zhang, D.",2014.0,,10.1099/vir.0.063313-0,0
2209,Genomic characterization and pathogenicity of a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus strain type 1,"The occurrence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus type 1 (PRRSV) has recently been observed in China. In the present study, the complete genomic characterization of a strain of PRRSV type 1 (named GZ11-G1) was described and its pathogenicity in piglets was analyzed. The results showed that the complete genome of GZ11-G1 with a size of 15,094 nt, excluding poly(A) tails, shared 80.2 to 96.3% identity with representative PRRSV type 1 strains and, in particular, , had the highest homology (96.3%) to Amervac PRRS, a live PRRSV type 1 vaccine virus, and SHE, a virus rescued from an infectious clone of Amervac PRRS virus. Compared to vaccinia virus, the structural and nonstructural proteins of GZ11-G1 showed wide amino acid variations except its ORF5a. GZ11-G1 clustered with PRRSV type 1 strains including Cresa3267, Cresa3249, Cresa3256, Olot/91, 9625/2012, ESP-1991-Olot91, and Amervac PRRS vaccinia virus by further phylogenetic analysis. In addition, GZ11-G1 was shown to cause fever, increased viremia, and lesions in the lungs and lymph nodes in piglets. Our findings indicate that GZ11-G1 is genetically related to PRRSV type 1 strains within the group consisting of Cresa3267, Cresa3249, Cresa3256, Olot/91, 9625/2012, ESP-1991-Olot91, and Amervac PRRS vaccinia virus. and it is a pathogenic virus for piglets.

2210,RNA-Seq analysis of duck embryo fibroblast cell gene expression during early stage of egg drop syndrome virus infection,"Egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV), a member of the Adenoviridae family and an economically important pathogen with a wide host range, leads to a marked decrease in egg production. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the host-EDSV interaction remains unclear. Here, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to study dynamic changes in host gene expression at 6, 12, and 24 hours post-infection in EDSV-infected duck embryo fibroblasts (DEF). A total of 441 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after EDSV infection. The Gene Ontology Category and Pathway Enrichment Analysis of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes revealed that these DEGs were associated with multiple biological functions, including signal transduction, host immunity, virus infection, cell apoptosis , cell proliferation and signaling pathways of metabolic processes and those related to pathogenicity. We screened and identified 12 DEG for further examination using qRT-PCR. The results of qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq were very consistent. This study analyzed viral infection and host immunity induced by EDSV infection from a novel perspective, and the results provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying host-EDSV interactions, which will be useful for future antiviral drug development. or vaccines for poultry, thus benefiting the entire poultry industry.",,"Wang, X.

2211,Integrated analysis of microRNA expression and mRNA transcriptome in broiler lungs infected with avian influenza virus,"BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of avian influenza virus (AIV) are global threats to both poultry and humans. Our previous study suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in regulating the host response to AIV infection in laying hens. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis whether genetic background plays an essential role in miRNA regulation of AIV infection in chickens and whether miRNAs that were differentially expressed in the AIV-infected layer would be modulated in the same way. way in broilers. Furthermore, by integrating with parallel mRNA expression profiles, potential molecular mechanisms of host response to AIV infection can be further exploited. RESULTS: Total RNA isolated from the lungs of low pathogenic H5N3-infected and uninfected broilers four days after infection was used for both deep miRNA sequencing and mRNA microarray analyses. A total of 2.6 M and 3.3 M high-quality filtered reads were obtained from infected and uninfected chickens by Solexa GA-I Sequencer, respectively. A total of 271 miRNAs were identified in miRBase 16.0 and one potential new miRNA was discovered. There were 121 miRNAs differentially expressed at a false discovery rate of 5% by Fisher's exact test. More miRNAs were expressed in infected lungs (108) than in uninfected lungs (13), which was opposite to the findings in laying hens. This result suggested that there might be a different regulatory mechanism of the miRNA-mediated host response to AIV infection in broilers. Analysis using the chicken Agilent 44K microarray indicated that 508 mRNAs (347 down-regulated) were differentially expressed after AIV infection. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive analysis combining miRNA gene expression and targeting mRNA suggests that gga-miR-34a, 122-1, 122-2, 146a, 155, 206, 1719, 1594, 1599, and 451, and MX1, IL- 8, IRF-7, TNFRS19 are strong candidate miRNAs or genes involved in regulating the host response to AIV infection in broiler lungs.

The 3' leader sequence comprises 50 nucleotides and shares a common terminal trinucleotide (UGC-3'), a conserved U-rich domain, and a variable AU-rich domain with other animal rhabdoviruses. The N gene comprises 1355 nucleotides from the transcription initiation sequence (AACAGG) to the poly(A) sequence [CATG(A)7] and encodes a polypeptide of 429 amino acids. The N protein has a calculated molecular mass of 49429 Da and a pI of 5.4 and, like the bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) N protein, has a highly acidic C-terminal domain. Analysis of the amino acid sequence relationships between all available rhabdovirus N proteins indicated that ARV and BEFV are closely related viruses (48.3% similarity) sharing greater sequence similarity with vesiculoviruses than with lyssaviruses.

2214,Comprehensive Analysis of Newcastle Disease Virus F Protein Cleavage Site Amino Acid Sequence Diversity on Fusogenic Activity,"Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a contagious agent of Newcastle disease in avian species and seriously affects the poultry industry. The viral F protein cleavage site (Fcs) is a key determinant of membrane fusion and viral virulence. In this study, we investigated the precise effect of variable amino acid sequences of Fcs on fusogenic activity. Based on viral pathogenicity, the Fcs sequences of natural isolates (n = 1572) are classified into eight types of virulent Fcs (VFcs) with the motif “G/R/KRQ/R/KR/K-Râ†“ F” and ten types of avirulent Fcs (AFcs) with the motif “G/R/ER/K/QQG/E-Râ†“L”. FCSV is only found in the Class II group of viral classification and not in Class I. AFcs exists in Class I and II isolates. The VFc and AFc types present an evolutionary relationship with the temporal distribution and the host species. Using an in vitro fusion assay, VFcs-1 ""RRQKRâ†""F"" and VFcs-2 ""RRQRRâ†""F"" show the highest efficiency in triggering membrane fusion. The neutral residue Q at position P3 of VFcs plays an enhancing role compared to the effect of basic residues R and K. A single K residue at P3 or P5 is less effective in fusogenic activity in VFcs with all residues. basics. Furthermore, the cleavage efficiencies of F0 proteins with different types of Fcs motifs do not appear to affect membrane fusion.

The two strains are characterized by the distinct insertion of a papain-like protease gene from toroviruses classified within the Coronaviridae family. According to recent reports, the torovirus protease insertion site was located in the 2C/3A junction region in EVG 02/NC_CHI/2014.

2220,Antigenic analysis of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 sublineages co-circulating in Egypt,"The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus has spread across Eurasia and Africa, and outbreaks are now endemic in several countries, including Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt. The continued circulation of H5N1 virus in Egypt, from a single infected source, has led to significant genetic diversification with phylogenetically separable sublineages, providing an opportunity to study the impact of genetic evolution on viral phenotypic variation. In this study, we analyzed the phylogeny of H5 hemagglutinin (HA) genes in influenza viruses isolated in Egypt between 2006 and 2011 and investigated the effect of conserved amino acid mutations in HA genes in each of the sublineages on their antigenicity. . Analysis showed that viruses in at least four sublineages still persisted in poultry in Egypt as of 2011. Using reverse genetics to generate HA reassortant viruses with HA-specific mutations, we found antigenic drift in HA in two sublineages of influenza virus, compared to the other influenza virus sublineages currently circulating in Egypt. Furthermore, the two sublineages with significant antigenic drift were antigenically distinguishable. Our findings suggested that phylogenetically divergent H5N1 viruses, which did not have antigenic cross-reactivity, were circulating in Egypt, indicating that there was a problem using a single influenza virus strain as the seed virus to produce the influenza virus vaccine. influenza in Egypt and provide data. to design more effective control strategies in H5N1 endemic areas. © 2012 SGM.",,"Watanabe, Y.;Ibrahim, M.

2221,Multiple Genotypes of Nonpathogenic H6N2 Influenza Viruses Isolated from Chickens in California,"From February 2000 through September 2001, a limited number of H6N2 influenza viruses were isolated from chickens in California. This report describes the genetic characterization of nine of these H6N2 viruses. All the viruses analyzed had phylogenetically similar hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase molecules suggesting that the viruses shared a recent common ancestor. Analysis of the HA sequence of these viruses with all available H6 viruses from different hosts and locations showed that these genes do not separate into well-defined North American and Eurasian lineages. The neuraminidase genes of the California viruses contain a deletion of 18 amino acids, a possible adaptation for growth in chickens. Analysis of the remaining genetic segments of the California viruses revealed that three distinct genotypes of H6N2 viruses were present.",,"Webby, R. J.;Woolcock, P. R.;Krauss, S. L.;Walker, D.

2223,Characterization of the canine serum virome from northeastern Brazil,"Domestic dogs share a habitat with humans, making them a potential source of zoonotic viruses. Additionally, awareness of potential bloodborne pathogens is important due to the increasing application of blood transfusions in dogs. In the present study, we evaluated the serum virome of 520 dogs by high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Serum samples were pooled and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform. Our unbiased method identified predominant canine pathogens such as canine protoparvovirus 1 (canine parvovirus 2), less-sought agents such as canine bocaparvovirus 1 (canine minute virus) and canine circovirus, circular viruses closely related to viruses recently found in human samples, and novel parvoviruses. and anelloviruses. .

2224,"Evaluation of serum virome in calves persistently infected with Pestivirus A, with or without mucosal disease","Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1, reclassified as Pestivirus A, causes an economically important bovine disease that is distributed worldwide. Pestivirus A can cause a persistent infection in that calves shed the virus throughout their lives, spreading the infection throughout the herd. Many persistently infected (PI) calves die within the first 2 years of life from mucosal disease (MD) or secondary infections, probably as a consequence of virus-induced immune depression. Here, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) was applied for total virome evaluation in sera from (i) PI calves showing clinically apparent MD (n = 8); (ii) PI calves without signs of MD (n = 8); and (iii) control, calves free of Pestivirus A (n = 8). All groups were collected at the same time and from the same herd. Serum samples from calves in each group were pooled, subjected to viral RNA/DNA enrichment, and sequenced by HTS. Viral genomes of Pestivirus A, Ungulate erythroparvovirus 1, bosavirus (BosV), and hypothetical circular single-stranded DNA encoding Rep (CRESS-DNA) viruses were identified. Specific real-time PCR assays were developed to determine the frequency of appearance of these viruses in each of the groups. The absolute number of distinct viral genomes detected in both groups of PI calves was higher than in the control group, as revealed by a larger number of reads, contigs, and genomes, representing a broader range of taxa. Genomes representing members of the Parvoviridae family, such as U. erythroparvovirus 1 and BosV, were detected more frequently in all three groups of calves. Only in PI calves affected by MD, we found two previously unreported hypothetical single-stranded DNA genomes clustered together with CRESS-DNA viruses. These findings reveal that parvoviruses were the most frequently detected viral genomes in bovine serum; its frequency of detection has no statistical correlation with the status of the calves in relation to Pestivirus A infection, as clinically normal or MD affected/PI unaffected calves were infected with similar genomic loads of U. erythroparvovirus 1. Furthermore, MD-affected PI calves were shown to support viremia of CRESS-DNA viral genomes; however, the meaning of such a correlation remains to be established.",,"Weber, M. N.;Cibulski, S.

2225,First evidence of bovine viral diarrhea virus infection in wild boar,"Background: Wild boar breeding has been increasing due to the interest of human consumption for this exotic meat. Such development may pose an increased risk of disease transmission between boars and domestic animals. The wild boar population has increased in South America in recent years due to the absence of predators, causing economic losses due to direct damage to crops and the risk of disease transmission. The Pestivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family is made up of four species recognized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV): classical swine fever virus (CSFV), border disease virus (BDV), bovine viral diarrhea type 1 (BVDV-1) and 2 (BVDV-2). Other putative species termed atypical pestiviruses have been reported as 'HoBi'-like viruses, giraffe pestivirus, Bungowannah pestivirus, pronghorn antelope virus, atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV), Norway rat pestivirus (NrPV), and Rhinolophus affinis bat pestivirus. (RaPestV-1). CSFV is commonly detected in wild boar, but despite positive serology, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) has never been detected in this animal species. Therefore, the present communication describes the first detection of BVDV in the lungs of captive boars using RT-PCR and DNA sequencing. Materials, Methods and Results: Forty lung samples were collected from farmed boars after slaughter in a commercial slaughterhouse. Organs were ground separately, centrifuged, and the supernatant stored for later analysis. Total RNA was isolated using a phenol-based protocol and an RT-PCR protocol was performed which amplified 118 bp of the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). One out of 40 samples was positive. The positive sample had partial 5' UTR and N-terminal autoprotease (N-pro) fragments sequenced and analyzed. The LV Java/2012 strain presented 99% identity in the 5'UTR and 98% in the N-pro region with a BVDV-2 previously reported in cattle in southern Brazil. In both the 5'UTR and Npro phylogenetic analyses, the LV Java/2015 strain clustered with the BVDV-2 strains and was more closely related to the 2b subtype identified in cattle from southern Brazil clustered at the same terminal node. Discussion: Wild boars are commonly associated with the transmission of pathogens to domestic animals. This animal species is considered a reservoir of the CSFV pestivirus and important keys in the CSFV control and eradication programs in Europe. Although the indirect presence of BVDV in wild boar has been reported by serological tests, direct detection of the viral agent has never been reported. The present study showed the presence of BVDV-2 genomic segments obtained by RT-PCR followed by DNA sequencing in captive wild boar. The reported data suggest a possible importance of this animal species in the epidemiology of ruminant pestiviruses that could interfere in the control and eradication programs of these important pathogens for cattle throughout the world. The LV Java/2012 strain was closely related to BVDV-2b and showed the highest identity with a strain detected in cattle from southern Brazil. These data suggest that wild boar and cattle could be sharing this pathogen due to the similarity of the strains and that both were reported in the same region. It may lead to the need to include feral pigs in BVDV control programs as boars can circulate between different regions and carry this pathogen to different cattle herds. The present study reported the first molecular evidence of BVDV in wild boar in the literature. The data generated here suggest a possible importance of boars in the epidemiology of ruminant pestiviruses.",,"Weber, M. N.;Pino, E. H. M.;Souza, C. K.;Mosena, A. C. S.;Sato, J. P.

Influenza virus surveillance studies in wild bird populations in the Americas, Europe, and Asia confirmed that wild waterfowl are the reservoir for all known influenza A viruses. Phylogenetic analysis groups influenza viruses in wild waterfowl into two distinct superfamilies: one in the Americas and one in Eurasia. The separation of viruses into American and Eurasian clades implies that transmission of HP H5 to the Americas by wild birds is likely to be a rare event.

2227,The pan-genome of Lactobacillus reuteri strains originating from the gastrointestinal tract of the pig,"BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus reuteri is a gut symbiont of a wide variety of vertebrate species that has diversified into distinct phylogenetic clades that are largely host-specific. Previous work demonstrated host specificity in mice and began to determine the mechanisms by which intestinal colonization and host restriction are achieved. However, it is unknown how L. reuteri strains colonize the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of pigs. RESULTS: To obtain information on the ecology of L. reuteri in the pig intestine, the genome sequence of the porcine small intestine isolate L. reuteri ATCC 53608 was completed and consisted of a 1.94 Mbp chromosome and two 138 plasmids. .5kbp and 9.09kbp. , respectively. In addition, we generated draft genomes of four additional L. reuteri strains isolated from pig feces or the lower gastrointestinal tract, lp167-67, pg-3b, 20-2, and 3c6, and subjected all five genomes to comparative genomic analysis together. with the previous one. complete genome of strain I5007. A phylogenetic analysis based on whole genomes showed that pig strains of L. reuteri fall into two distinct clades, as previously suggested by multilocus sequence analysis. These six pig L. reuteri genomes contained a core set of 1,364 orthologous gene clusters, as determined by OrthoMCL analysis, contributing to a pan-genome with a total of 3,373 gene clusters. Genome comparisons of the six pig L. reuteri strains with 14 L. reuteri strains from other host origins yielded a total pan-genome of 5,225 gene clusters that included a core genome of 851 gene clusters, but revealed no there were pig-specific genes per group. I know. However, specific and conserved genes were detected between strains of the two phylogenetic lineages of pigs, some of which encoded cell surface proteins that could contribute to the diversification of the two lineages and their observed host specificity. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends the phylogenetic analysis of L. reuteri strains at the genome-wide level, pointing to distinct evolutionary trajectories of porcine L. reuteri lineages and providing new insights into genomic events in L. reuteri that occurred during the specialization to its Hosts. The emergence of two distinct pig-derived clades may reflect differences in host genotype, environmental factors such as dietary components, or the evolution of ancestral strains of human and rodent origin following contact with pig populations.",,"Wegmann, U.;MacKenzie, D.

2228,Genetic dynamic analysis of influenza A H5N1 NS1 gene in China,"Direct precursors of the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (GS/GD) virus lineage and their reassortments have been established geographically and ecologically. To investigate the variation and evolutionary dynamics of H5N1 viruses, whole genome viral sequences (n = 164) were retrieved from NCBI's influenza virus resource. Here, we present phylogenetic evidence for intrasubtype rearrangements among H5N1 viruses isolated from China during 1996-2012. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, we identified four main groups and further classified the reassortant viruses into three subgroups. The putative mosaic structures were found mainly in viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes and 91.0% (10/11) of the mosaics were obtained from land birds. Sequence variability and selection pressure analyzes revealed that both surface glycoproteins (HA and NA) and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) have a higher dN/dS ratio and variability than other internal proteins. Furthermore, we detected 47 positively selected sites in genomic segments with the exception of the PB2 and M1 genes. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are considered highly variable due to host immune pressure; however, it is not known what drives the variability of NS1. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the genetic variation and selective pressure of the NS1 protein (462 NS1 sequences available). We found that most of the positively selected sites and variable amino acids were located in the C-terminal effector domain (ED) of NS1. Furthermore, we focused on NS1-RNA and NS1-protein interactions that were involved in viral replication mechanisms and host immune response. Transcriptomic analysis of H5N1-infected monkey lungs showed that certain PI3K-related genes were upregulated.",,"Wei, K.;Chen, Y.;Lin, Y.;Pan, Y.",2014.0,,,0
2229,Global genetic variation and transmission dynamics of the H9N2 avian influenza virus,"H9N2 influenza viruses circulate widely in the poultry population, and variable genotypes can be generated through mutation, recombination, and rearrangement, which may be better adapted to infect a new host, resist drug treatment, or escape pressure. immune. LPAI H9N2 viruses have the potential to evolve to high levels of virulence in humans. Some studies on regional spread have been reported, but the global spread and drivers of the virus are poorly understood, particularly at the genome scale. Here, we have analyzed all eight gene segments from 168 randomly sampled H9N2 genomes with the aim of providing a panoramic framework to better understand virus genesis and genetic variation, and used phylogeography and spatial epidemiology approaches to uncover the effects of genetic variation. Genetic variation, predictors and spread of H9N2 viruses. We found that the most frequent rearrangement events involved PA, NP, and NS segments, and 21 isolates have a possible mosaic structure resulting from recombination events. Estimates of gene-specific global dN/dS ratios showed that all genes were subject to purifying selection. However, a total of 13 sites under positive selection were detected by at least two of three methods, which were located within the HA, NA, M2, NS1, and PA segments. Furthermore, we infer that the NA segment has the highest rate of nucleotide substitution, and its tMRCA estimate is the youngest than the inference from the remaining segments. Looking at spatial history, human air travel was identified as the predominant driver of global viral migration using GLM analysis, with economic factors and geographic distance being modest predictors. Higher migration rates were estimated between five pairs of regions (>0.01), indicating frequent migration of viruses between discrete geographic locations. Furthermore, our Markov jump analysis showed that viral migration is more frequent between southern and northern China, and a high rate of gene flow was observed between the Americas and East Asia. Furthermore, the Americas together with Southeast Asia acted as the main centers of global transmission, forming the trunk of the evolutionary tree. These findings suggested a complex interplay between the evolution of the virus, epidemiology, and human behavior.",,"Wei, K.;Li, Y.",2018.0,,10.1111/tbed.12733,0

However, reports of Newcastle disease (ND) outbreaks caused by genotype VIII NDV strains are rare. In this study, a virulent genotype VIII strain of NDV, designated GXGB2011, was isolated from a flock of vaccinated game birds showing clinical signs of infection in Pinxiang County, Guangxi, China. The complete genome of the isolate was completely sequenced and found to be composed of 15,192 nucleotides (nt), encoding the six structural proteins in the order of 3â€²-NP-PMF-HN-L-5â€². The pattern of the 112RRQKRâ†“F117 cleavage site in the fusion protein (F) and the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) value of 1.5 showed that strain GXGB2011 was a velogenic NDV. The results of the challenge experiment with the 5 week old SPF chickens showed that the strain was highly pathogenic with 100% morbidity and mortality of the challenged birds. Based on virus detection in different organs of infected birds, the highest viral load was observed in cecal tonsils and viral levels in immune organs were higher than in respiratory organs. Bayesian reconstruction of whole genomes based on the sequences of 66 NDV reference strains showed that the strain belonged to NDV genotype VIII. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the strain was more closely related to the foreign strains gamefowl/US(CA)/24225/98, 1ITTY94060, and IT-147/94 than to the first domestic strains of the emergence genotype VIII in Qinghai, China during 1979. €“1985.

2231,Genetic and pathobiological characterization of 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza viruses from a naturally infected pig herd,"Since its initial identification in Mexico and the United States, concern has been raised that the novel H1N1 influenza virus could cause a pandemic of comparable severity to the 1918 pandemic. In late April 2009, viruses phylogenetically related to pandemic H1N1 influenza virus from an outbreak on a Canadian pig farm. This outbreak also had epidemiological links to a suspected human case. Experimental infections in pigs using one of the pig isolates from this outbreak and the human isolate A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009 showed differences in virus recovery from the lower respiratory tract. Virus was consistently isolated from the lungs of pigs infected with A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009, whereas only one pig infected with A/swine/Alberta/OTH-33-8/2008 produced live lung virus, despite high amounts. virus comparables. RNA and antigen in both groups of pigs. The clinical disease resembled other influenza virus infections in pigs, albeit with somewhat prolonged detection of virus antigen and delayed clearance of viral RNA from the lungs. There was also a remarkable amount of genotypic variability among the viruses isolated from pigs on the farm. This, together with the somewhat patchy pathobiological features observed in experimentally infected animals, suggests that although the virus may be of porcine origin, significant viral evolution may still be ongoing.

2234,Investigation of possible causes of the development of porcine ear necrosis: different study designs: comparable results? German,"Two studies investigating the etiology of porcine ear necrosis have been carried out in recent years at the Swine Clinic of the Vienna University of Veterinary Medicine. In Study 1, the parameters, which are discussed in this context, were collected by veterinarians completing specially designed questionnaires on farms with symptoms of porcine ear necrosis syndrome. In Study 2, piglet and feed samples were collected for laboratory analysis of the most important infectious agents as well as mycotoxins. In the present manuscript, the results of both projects were compared. Even if the selection criteria of both studies differed, the affected age class was comparable (5.5 to 10 weeks of age in Study 1 and 6 to 10 weeks of age in Study 2). The herd-specific prevalence of porcine ear necrosis syndrome varied considerably with percentages between 2 and 10, respectively, up to 100%. The evaluation of the questionnaires in study 1 showed that 51% of the farms had cannibalism problems. Particles of plant material, which were frequently observed in the histological slides in Study 2, could have entered the tissue by chewing on the ears of pen mates or by cannibalism. While in study 1 the negative effect of parameters such as high pig density, suboptimal climate, lack of enrichment material, and poor feed and water quality were considered, in study 2 all these factors were verified in sample collection and were dismissed as harbingers of cannibalism. In both studies, bacterial agents proved to be a crucial cofactor for the spread of necroses to deeper tissue layers, while viral pathogens were ranked as less important. In both projects it was not possible to estimate the direct impact of infectious agents and mycotoxins as direct triggers of necrosis, as well as their participation as cofactors or precursors in the sense of immunosuppression or prior damage to blood vessels or tissues.",,"Weissenbacher-Lang, C.;Voglmayr, T.;Weissenbock, H.;Pyrek, R.;Waxenecker, F.;Hofstetter, U.;Hoelzle, K.;Hoelzle, L.

The viruses were isolated from Malaysia and various areas of Japan over a period of 30 years. On the basis of available published sequence data, oligonucleotide primers for RT-PCR were designed and sequences determined. Our findings showed that although there were nucleotide sequence differences in the nsP1 region, there was 100% amino acid homology. On the other hand, in the capsid region, the nucleotide differences caused a large difference in the amino acid sequence. Therefore, the difference in capsid region is one of the useful markers in genetic classification between Sagiyama virus and Getah virus strains, and could be responsible for the serological difference in complement fixation test. Genomic differences between Getah virus strains are due to the time factor rather than geographic distribution.",,"Wekesa, S. N.;Inoshima, Y.;Murakami, K.;Sentsui, H.",2001.0,2008-11-01 00:00:00,,0

2237,Avipoxviruses: biology of infection and their use as vaccine vectors,"Avipoxviruses (APV) belong to the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily of the Poxviridae family. APVs are distributed worldwide and cause disease in domestic, companion, and wild birds of many species. VPAs are transmitted by aerosols and the bite of insects, particularly mosquitoes and arthropods, and are generally named after the bird species from which they were originally isolated. Fowlpox virus (FWPV) species causes disease in poultry and associated mortality is usually low, but in flocks under stress (other diseases, high production) mortality can reach up to 50%. APVs are also important players in the development of viral vaccine vectors for diseases in human and veterinary medicine. Abortive infection in mammalian cells (no progeny virus production) and their ability to adapt to multiple gene insertions are some of the features that make APVs promising vaccine vectors. Although abortive infection in mammalian cells possibly represents an important biosafety advantage of the vaccine, the molecular mechanisms that restrict APVs to certain hosts are not yet fully understood. This review summarizes current knowledge related to APVs, including classification, morphogenesis, host-virus interactions, diagnosis, and disease, and also highlights the use of APVs as recombinant vaccine vectors. © 2011 Weli and Tryland; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Weli, S.

2238,Types and strains: their essential role in understanding protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases,"Protein misfolding and aggregation is a key event in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD) and is associated with neurodegeneration. The factors that initiate protein misfolding and the role of protein aggregation in the pathophysiology of disease pose significant challenges to the neuroscientific community. Interestingly, although accumulation of the same misfolded protein, eg, α-synuclein, is detectable in all patients with idiopathic PD, the disease spectrum covers a variety of different clinical presentations and disease courses. In a more recent attempt, this clinical variation is explained in analogy with prion diseases by different conformations of protein aggregates. In prion diseases, a relationship between the conformational properties of protein aggregates and the clinical course of the disease was demonstrated by relating different types of prions to a course of dementia and ataxic disease in Creutzfeldt-Jakob patients. This principle is currently transferred to AD, PD and other neurodegenerative diseases with protein aggregation. However, differences in the conformation of protein aggregates are frequently addressed as disease strains. The term ""strain"" is also derived from prion research and evolved by adopting virus terminology at a time when transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs, later called prion diseases) were assumed to be caused by a virus. The problem is that in virus taxonomy the term ""type"" refers to the properties of the pathogen itself and the term ""strain"" refers to factors associated with the host that interact with the pathogen and can moderately modify the clinical presentation. of the illness. Stress factors can be discovered only after transmission and passage of the agent in a host of a different species. Incorrect use of terminology confuses disease agent and host factors and makes it difficult to understand the pathophysiology of protein aggregate-associated neurodegenerative diseases. This review article reviews the findings that explain how the terms ""type"" and ""strain"" for unconventional disease agents came to be. This can help avoid confusion in the terminology of protein aggregation diseases and correctly reflect the impact of protein aggregate conformation as well as host factor contribution in the different clinical variations of AD, PD and AD. other neurodegenerative diseases.",,"Wemheuer, W.

2239,Comments on the definition of the duck circovirus (DuCV) genotype,"standardized methodology has been used to define genotypes based on pairwise sequence comparisons (PASC). PASC is a widely accepted method in virus taxonomy, which is based on the histogram of pairwise differences between sequences. Recently, Zhang et al. (2013) concluded that the average duck circovirus (DuCV) p-distance between genotypes 1 and 2 was 0.170, and the subtype distance thresholds were 0.032 in DuCV-1 and 0.018 in DuCV-2, respectively. However, there may be some concerns about the application of the methodology to define the DuCV genotype. Considering the concerns mentioned above, our authors performed PASC analyzes of capsid gene 54 (ORF2) and genomic sequences, including all sequences from Zhang et al. (2013). Our results confirmed the existence of two DuCV genotypes (1 and 2) and, we suggest that DuCV ORF2 and genomic distance genotype thresholds were 0.061 and 0.038, respectively. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,"Wen, H.;Wu, Y.;Yang, C.;Zhang, X.;Lian, C.;Chen, H.;Han, L.",2014.0,,10.1016/j.gene.2014.01.004,0

Experiments were performed with pig and sheep sera raised against the strains. The results were analyzed by a computerized taxonomic procedure. The 16 viruses were classified into four distinct serological groups. All hog cholera virus (HCV) strains were classified into one group; the other three groups consisted of strains that can infect pigs, but are either identified as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) or border disease virus (BDV), or showed a closer relationship with BVDV and BDV than with BVDV.

2241,Detection of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in pig livers in southeastern Germany and high sequence homology to human HEV isolates,"Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has been identified as an emerging cause of infectious hepatitis in recent years in developed countries. Unlike travel-associated hepatitis E, zoonotic sources of infection are suspected for autochthonous cases in Europe. Objective: Since pigs are known reservoirs of HEV, we tested pig livers sold as food in southeastern Germany for the presence of hepatitis E virus RNA. Study design: We purchased 200 pig liver samples from 81 butcher shops and supermarkets in Regensburg, Germany. Nucleic acid preparations were analyzed for the presence of HEV RNA by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). HEV isolates from positive samples were characterized by partial sequencing of the ORF1 and ORF2 regions in the HEV genome and by phylogenetic analysis. Results: Samples from eight (4%) of 200 purchased pig livers had detectable amounts of HEV RNA. Sequence determination and phylogenetic analysis allowed two new isolates to be classified as HEV genotype 3, subgenotype 3a (swR437) and 3c (swR269), respectively. Both novel porcine HEV isolates showed high sequence homology to isolates obtained from patients with acute HEV infection from the same geographic region. Conclusions: These results support the suggested role of undercooked pork products in food as a source of zoonotic HEV infection in humans. Whether this transmission mechanism is responsible for the surprisingly high prevalence of anti-HEV IgG recently observed in some European countries and in the USA remains to be clarified. © 2011 Elsevier BV",,"Wenzel, J.

2242,Schmallenberg virus: a new virus of veterinary importance,"In late 2011, non-specific clinical symptoms such as fever, diarrhea and decreased milk production were observed in dairy cattle in the Dutch/German border region. After exclusion of classical emerging and endemic viruses by specific diagnostic systems, blood samples from acutely ill cows were subjected to metagenomic analysis. An insect-borne orthobunyavirus of the Simbu serogroup was identified as the causative agent and named Schmallenberg virus (SBV). It was one of the first detections of the introduction of a new virus of veterinary importance to Europe using new next-generation sequencing technology. Subsequently, the virus was isolated from samples identical to those used for metagenomic analysis in insect and mammalian cell lines, and disease symptoms were reproduced in calves experimentally infected with both this cultured virus and blood samples from diseased cattle. Since its appearance, SBV has spread very rapidly among the European ruminant population, causing mild and nonspecific disease in adult animals, but also premature or stillbirths and severe fetal malformations when naïve mothers were infected during a critical phase of gestation. In subsequent years, the SBV regularly recirculated to a greater extent; in the 2014 and 2016 vector seasons, the virus was repeatedly detected in the blood of adult ruminants, and in the following winter and spring months, several malformed calves and lambs were born. The genome of viruses present in viremic adult animals showed very high sequence stability; in sequences generated between 2012 and 2016, only a few amino acid substitutions could be detected compared to the initial SBV isolate. In contrast, high sequence variability was identified in the amino-terminal part of the Gc glycoprotein coding region of viruses present in the brains of newborns with malformations. This critical point of mutation is independent of the region or host species from which the samples originated and is potentially involved in immune evasion mechanisms.",,"Wernike, K.;Beer, M.",2017.0,,10.1016/bs.aivir.2017.07.001,0

In 2006, a highly pathogenic NA strain of PRRSV (HP-PRRSV), characterized by high fever and high morbidity and mortality, emerged in pig farms in China. Therefore, a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay specific for HP-PRRSV was developed and combined with type 1 and type 2-specific RT-qPCR systems. an internal control, based on a heterologous RNA, was successfully introduced. This final PRRSV RT-qPCR multiplex, which detects and types PRRSV, had an analytical sensitivity of less than 200 copies per μl for the type 1 assay and 20 copies per μl for the type 2 and HP assays and high diagnostic sensitivity. A panel of reference strains and field isolates were reliably detected and samples from an animal test with a Chinese strain of HP-PRRS were used for assay validation.

2246,Molecular evolution of viral fusion and matrix protein genes and phylogenetic relationships among the Paramyxoviridae,"Phylogenetic relationships among Paramyxoviridae, a large family of viruses whose members cause devastating diseases in wildlife, cattle, and humans, were examined with fusion (F) and matrix (M) protein coding sequences. Neighbor joining trees of F and M protein sequences showed that the Paramyxoviridae was divided into the two traditionally recognized subfamilies, Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae. Within the Paramyxovirinae, the results also showed clusters corresponding to three currently recognized genera: Respirovirus, Morbillivirus, and Rubulavirus. Relationships among the three Paramyxovirinae genera were resolved with M protein sequences and there was significant support (100%) showing that members of the Respirovirus genus and Morbillivirus genus were more closely related to each other than to members of the Rubulavirus genus. . Both the F and M phylogeny showed that Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was more closely related to the Rubulavirus genus than to the other two genera, but they were consistent with the proposal (BS Seal et al., 2000, Virus Res 66, 1-11) that NDV is classified as a separate genus within the Paramyxovirinae. Both the F and M phylogeny were also consistent with the proposal (L. Wang et al., 2000, J. Virol 74, 9972-9979) to classify Hendra virus as a new genus closely related and basal to the genus Morbillivirus.

Fecal material from the diseased bird was collected before and after treatment. For RNA sequencing, the extracted RNA/DNA was subjected to DNase, and the remaining RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA and subjected to multiple displacement amplification prior to sequencing. RESULTS: No significant alignment with any known avian virus sequence was obtained from any fecal sample. However, significant BLAST alignments were obtained with five bacteriophages known to infect Enterobacteriaceae. Strong evidence for the presence of the bacteriophage Escherichia phage TL-2011b, a bacteriophage known to occur in Escherichia coli and cause outbreaks of foodborne illness in humans, was obtained in the sample from the sick bird, but not in the group. not sick Differences in E. coli community structure between the sick bird and the non-sick group were also evident.

The entire 2085 nt genome was cloned and sequenced and contains both capsid and replicase genes as well as a conserved 9 nt motif. Phylogenetic analyzes place it within the Circoviridae, adjacent to other environmental CRESS-DNA viruses, and more closely related to the badger circovirus-like virus (Meles meles circovirus-like virus).

2249,Serologic evidence of influenza D virus exposure among persons with occupational contact with livestock,"Background: Influenza D virus (IDV), a new influenza virus with proposed classification: Orthomyxoviridae family, Influenzavirus D genus, Influenzavirus D species, has been associated with influenza-like illnesses in cattle and pigs. More recently, anti-IDV antibodies have also been detected in small ruminants. A seroprevalence of approximately 1.3% has been estimated for the general human population. Objectives: Obtain information on the zoonotic potential of IDV for human adults with occupational exposure to livestock in north central Florida. Study: A cross-sectional serological study was performed on human serum samples from 35 cattle-exposed adults and 11 cattle-naive adults for IDV antibodies using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays. Results: A seroprevalence of 91% was detected by the HI assay and 97% by the MN assay among Florida cattle handlers. Among individuals not exposed to cattle, seropositivity determined by the MN assay (alone) was lower (18%). Conclusions: IDV presents a zoonotic risk for workers exposed to livestock, according to the detection of high seroprevalence (94-97%).

This study describes the isolation and characterization of two new orthobunyaviruses obtained from a jungle myna and a rice bird from Karnataka state, India. Using an NGS approach, these isolates were classified as Cat Que and Balagodu viruses belonging to the Manzanilla clade of the Simbu serogroup. Closely related viruses in the Manzanilla clade have been isolated from mosquitoes, humans, birds, and pigs over a wide geographic region. Given that Orthobunyaviruses show a high reassortment frequency and can cause self-limited acute febrile illness, these data suggest that human and livestock Oya/Cat Que/Manzanilla virus infections may be more widespread and/or underreported than anticipated. Therefore, it becomes imperative to identify new and unknown viruses to understand their role in human and animal pathogenesis.

2251,"Prevalence of hepatitis E virus antibodies among humans and apparently healthy pigs in Bali, Indonesia: identification of a pig infected with hepatitis E virus genotype A 4","In Indonesia, where hepatitis E virus (HEV) is believed to be highly endemic, only three outbreaks of HEV transmission in restricted areas (West Kalimantan and East Java) have been documented to date. A total of 1,115 serum samples collected from apparently healthy individuals in Bali, Lombok and Surabaya in Indonesia in 1996, where epidemic transmissions of HEV have never been reported, were tested for IgG class antibodies against HEV (anti-HEV). In Bali, anti-HEV was detected in 20% (54/276) of the population tested, in marked contrast to 4% (17/446) in Lombok and 0.5% (2/393) in Surabaya. On the other hand, hepatitis A virus antibodies were highly prevalent in all three regions (95% in Bali, 90% in Lombok, and 89% in Surabaya). Although the majority of the population in Indonesia is Muslim, the Balinese are mostly Hindu and have a custom of eating pork. Therefore, serum samples from 99 farmed pigs in Bali were obtained and analyzed for anti-HEV and HEV RNA. Sera from 71 pigs (72%) were positive for anti-HEV and one 2-month-old pig had detectable HEV RNA. The porcine HEV isolate recovered from the viremic pig was named SB66-Bali. Isolate SB66-Bali was most closely related to genotype 4 isolates from China, India, Japan, and Taiwan, but shared only 82.6-90.0% identity in the common 241-412 nucleotides within reading frame open 2 (ORF2).

2252,Influenza A Virus Matrix Gene Isolated from Wild Waterfowl: Ecology and Emergence of Influenza A Viruses,"Wild waterfowl are the main reservoir for influenza A viruses, but little is known about the gene pool of viruses in wild birds. Therefore, we investigated the ecology and emergence of influenza viruses by performing a phylogenetic analysis of 70 array (M) genes from influenza viruses isolated from shorebirds and gulls in the Delaware Bay region. and ducks in Alberta, Canada, during more than 18 years of surveillance. In our analysis, we included 61 published M genes from isolates from various hosts. We show that M genes from viruses from Canadian ducks and those from Delaware Bay shorebirds and gulls shared ancestors with M genes from North American poultry viruses. We found that North American and Eurasian avian lineages are divided into sub-lineages, indicating that multiple branches of virus evolution may be maintained in wild waterfowl. The presence of non-H13 gull viruses in the gull-like lineage and of H13 gull viruses in other avian lineages suggested that gull M genes do not preferentially associate with the H13 subtype or segregate in a distinct lineage. Some North American avian influenza viruses contained M genes closely related to those of Eurasian avian viruses. Therefore, there may be interregional admixture of the two clades. Shorebird M and HA gene rearrangement was evident, but there was no correlation between HA or NA subtype, M gene sequence, and isolation time.

2253,A new emerging genotype subgroup within PCV-2b dominates the Swiss PMWS epizootic,"Post-weaning multi-system wasting syndrome (PMWS) is among the most important emerging swine diseases worldwide. Initially, the insidious nature of the disease made it difficult to identify the pathogen. The presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in all PMWS-sick animals led to its acceptance, possibly together with an unknown factor, as the causative agent of PMWS. Furthermore, the presence of PCV2 in healthy individuals did not facilitate understanding of the disease. Phylogenetic classification separates PCV2 viruses into at least two main groups. With the help of a distinctive motif, a short amino acid motif encoded within the capsid protein, viruses are determined to belong to PCV-2a or PCV-2b. Recently, this classification received more attention as it seemed to define PCV-2b as more virulent. This simplification, however, could not be confirmed experimentally. Therefore, we investigated whether the genetic change of the virus was an initiator of the PMWS epizootic in Switzerland. Lymphoid tissues from piglets from 1973 to 2005 were investigated by histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and PCR. For genotyping, a 137 bp sequence amplification spanning the characteristic motif was used. The onset of the Swiss PMWS epizootic showed a marked shift in subclinically infected and diseased piglets from PMWS to PCV-2b and specifically to a genotype subgroup. Complementary to these observations, healthy piglets also defined by IHC as negative are positive in the PCR reaction and do not have any PCV-2b virus during the epizootic. Consequently, our data support PCV2 genome plasticity as an important factor contributing to PMWS disease manifestation. © 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Wiederkehr, D.

AIV was detected in 222 (9.1%) of 2,441 ducks in 2007 and in 438 (17.9%) of 2,452 ducks in 2008. AIV prevalence peaked in late summer. We detected 27 AIV subtypes during 2007 and 31 during 2008. Ten hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes were detected each year (ie, H1, 3-8, and 10-12 during 2007; H1-8, 10, and 11 during 2008). All neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were detected during each year of the study. Subtype diversity varied between years and increased with prevalence through September.

Wild birds are an important example, as apart from influenza A virus, bird samples are rarely tested for viruses, especially in the absence of overt disease. Using massive RNA sequencing (""meta-transcriptomics""), we reveal the viral diversity present in Australian wild birds through the lens of ecological factors that may determine virome structure and abundance. A metatranscriptomic analysis of four Anseriformes (waterfowl) and Charadriiformes (shorebird) species sampled from temperate and arid Australia revealed the presence of 27 RNA virus genomes, 18 of which represent newly described species. Identified viruses included a previously described gammacoronavirus and influenza A viruses. In addition, we identified new virus species from the families Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Picornaviridae. We observed differences in virome structure that reflected underlying differences in location and status of influenza A infection. individuals sampled in the temperate zone of Australia. In Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) and Duck Ducks (Anas spp.), viral abundance and diversity were higher and more similar in hosts that tested positive for influenza A infection compared with those that tested negative for influenza A , even though the samples were collected on the same day and from the same place.

2260,Viral diversity of house mice in New York City,"The microbiome of wild Mus musculus (house mouse), a globally distributed invasive pest that resides in close contact with humans in urban centers, is largely unexplored. Here, we report fecal virome analysis of house mice in residential buildings in New York City, NY. Mice were collected from seven sites in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx over a 1-year period. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing of stool revealed 36 viruses from 18 families and 21 genera, including at least 6 new viruses and 3 new genera. A representative screen of 15 viruses by PCR confirmed the presence of 13 of these viruses in the liver. We identified an uneven distribution of diversity, with several viruses associated with specific locations. Higher mouse weight was associated with an increase in the amount of virus detected per mouse, after adjusting for site, sex, and length. We found no genetic fingerprints of known human viral pathogens and no antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. IMPORTANCE Mice are carriers of a wide range of infectious agents with zoonotic potential. Therefore, their proximity to humans in the built environment is a public health concern. Laboratory mice are also the most common experimental model for investigating the pathobiology of infectious diseases. In this survey of mice trapped in various locations within New York City over a 1-year period, we found a diverse collection of viruses including some not previously associated with house mice and others that appear to be novel. Although we found no known human pathogens, our findings provide insights into viral ecology and may yield models that have utility for clinical microbiology.",,"Williams, S. H.;Che, X. Y.;Garcia, J.

2261,Meeting Report: 2013 PDA Virus & TSE Safety Forum,"The report provides a summary of the presentations and discussions at the 2013 Virus and ERT Safety Forum organized by the Parenteral Medicines Association (PDA) and held in Berlin, Germany, from June 4-6, 2013. The conference was accompanied of a workshop, ""Virus spike preparations and virus removal by filtration: new trends and developments"". The presentations and discussion at the workshop are summarized in a separate report that will also be published in this issue of the magazine. As with the previous conferences in this series, the 2013 Virus & TSE PDA Security Forum again provided an excellent opportunity for the exchange of information and views between industry, research organizations and regulatory bodies. Agencies from the European Union (EU), the United States (US), and Singapore provided updates on regulatory considerations related to the virus and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) from biopharmaceuticals. The epidemiology and detection methods of new emerging pathogens such as hepatitis E virus and parvovirus (PARV 4) were exemplified, and the risk of contamination of raw materials of animal origin such as trypsin was considered in particular. The benefit of using new sequence-based virus detection methods was discussed. Past bioreactor contamination events have drawn attention to root cause investigations and preventative actions, which were illustrated with several examples. Virus removal data for specific drive operations was provided; The discussion focused on the virus removal mechanism and the strategic concept of virus removal integration. As in previous years, the virus safety section was followed by a TSE section covering recent scientific findings that may influence risk assessment of blood and cell substrates. These included the finding that interspecies transmission of TSEs by blood components in sheep is greater than that predicted by tests in transgenic mice. In addition, the pathogenesis and possibility of productive TSE infection of cell substrates were considered, and cell-based assays that may be suitable for use in TSE clearance studies were discussed. The current report provides an overview of the results of the 2013 Virus & TSE PDA Security Forum, a unique event in this field. ©PDA, Inc. 2014.",,"Willkommen, H.;BlÃ¼mel, J.;Brorson, K.;Chen, D.;Chen, Q.;GrÃ¶ner, A.;Hubbard, B.

2262,"Online Sexually Transmitted Infection (e-STI) Testing and Results Service: A Randomized, Single-Blind, Controlled Trial","Background: Internet-based testing for sexually transmitted infections (electronic STI tests) is becoming increasingly available as an alternative to clinic-based testing. Typically, this testing modality allows users to request a test kit from a virtual service (via a website or app), collect their own samples, return the test samples to a laboratory, and receive notification of your results by short message service (SMS) or by phone. . e-STI tests are supposed to increase access to tests compared to face-to-face services, but the evidence is not clear. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of an e-STI (chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, and syphilis) testing and outcomes service on STI testing uptake and diagnosed STI cases. Methods and results: The study was carried out in the London Boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark. Between November 24, 2014 and August 31, 2015, we recruited 2,072 participants, ages 16 to 30, who resided in these districts, had at least one sexual partner in the past 12 months, stated they were willing to get an STI test and had internet access. Those who could not give their consent and could not read in English were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 text message with a web link to an e-STI testing and results service (intervention group) or to receive 1 text message with a web link to a personalized website listing locations, contact details and websites of 7 local sexual health clinics (control group). Participants were free to use any other services or interventions during the study period. Primary outcomes were self-reported STI testing at 6 weeks, verified by patient record checks, and self-reported STI diagnoses at 6 weeks, verified by patient record checks. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of participants prescribed treatment for an STI, the time from randomisation to completion of an STI trial, and the time from randomisation to STI treatment. Participants received a £10 cash incentive on self-report data submission. We completed all follow-up, including patient record checks, by June 17, 2016. Uptake of STI testing increased in the intervention group at 6 weeks (50.0% versus 26.6%, risk relative [RR] 1.87, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.15, P < 0.001). The proportion of participants diagnosed was 2.8% in the intervention group versus 1.4% in the control group (RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.70, P = 0.079) . No evidence of heterogeneity was observed for any of the prespecified subgroup analyses. The proportion of treated participants was 1.1% in the intervention group versus 0.7% in the control group (RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.16, P = 0.231) . Time to test was shorter in the intervention group compared to the control group (28.8 days versus 36.5 days, P < 0.001, restricted median survival time difference test [RMST]), but no differences were observed in time to treatment (83.2 days). days versus 83.5 days, P = 0.51, RMST difference test). We were unable to recruit the planned 3000 participants and therefore lacked power for analyzes of STI diagnoses and treated STI cases. Conclusions: The e-STI testing service increased STI testing uptake for all groups, including high-risk groups. The intervention required people to attend the clinic for treatment and did not reduce time to treatment. Service innovations are required to improve treatment rates for people diagnosed online and could include electronic and postal treatment services. e-STI testing services require long-term monitoring and evaluation.

The emphasis of this review is on the diagnostic tools available to North American veterinarians. Standard diagnostic tests are readily available for BT/EHD viruses, and described tests are published in the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Manual. However, there is considerable variation in the diagnostic approach to these viruses. Serological tests are well established and many laboratories have experience in performing these tests. Numerous nucleic acid amplification assays are also available for BT virus (BTV) and EHD virus (EHDV). Although there is considerable experience with reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) of BTV, there are no standards or comparisons of the protocols used by various state and federal veterinary diagnostic laboratories.",,"Wilson, W.

2265,Classification of Marek's disease viruses according to pathotype: Philosophy and methodology,"The concept of a pathotype in Marek's disease (MD) probably dates to the recognition of a more virulent form of the disease in the late 1950s (Benton & Cover, 1957). Distinctions between MD virus strains were further expanded with the description of the vv pathotype in the early 1980s and the vv+ pathotype in the 1990s. Pathotype designations reflect important biological properties that correlate with the advancement of vaccine immunity in the field. However, pathotyping methods applied by various laboratories have not been uniform, precluding critical comparison of results. Better uniformity of pathotyping procedures is desirable. The method of the Avian Diseases and Oncology Laboratory (ADOL) is based on the induction of lymphoproliferative lesions in vaccinated chickens. This method has been used to pathotype more than 45 isolates and is the basis for the current pathotyping of MD virus strains. Its limitations include requirements for a specific type of chickens (15 x 7 ab+), a large number of animals, and a statistical method to compare lesion responses with those of control strains JM/102W and Md5. Due to these limitations, it has not been and is not likely to be used in other laboratories. Pathotyping comparability can be improved by comparing field isolates to standard prototype strains such as JM/102W, Md5, and 648A (American Type Culture Collection) or their equivalents. Data can be generated by different in vivo procedures that measure tumor induction, neurological disease (both neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions), or non-neoplastic criteria only (such as lymphoid organ weight or virus replication). Methods based on neoplastic criteria, especially when generated in MD-immunized chickens, will likely correlate more closely with the ADOL method and be more relevant to the evolution of MD virus in the field. Based on data from several trials, a modification of the ADOL method is proposed that uses fewer chickens and can be performed with specific pathogen-free commercial strains. The modified method is based on ""best fit"" comparisons with prototype strains and is expected to provide results generally comparable to the original method. A variety of other alternative criteria (see above) are also evaluated for both primary pathotyping and adjuncts to other pathotyping methods. The advantages and disadvantages of the alternative methods are presented. © 2005 Houghton Trust Ltd.",,"Witter, R. L.;Calnek, B. W.;Buscaglia, C.;Gimeno, I. M.;Schat, K.

Hemagglutinated red blood cells isolated from guinea pig, rhesus monkey and rooster. Using hemagglutination inhibition tests, the isolate was shown to be antigenically distinct from parvoviruses of bovine and canine origin. Specific hemagglutination inhibitory antibody against the viral isolate was exhibited by 26 of 136 horse sera tested. The isolated virus showed properties consistent with those of an autonomous parvovirus including size, morphology, stability to ether treatment and heating to 56°C, presence of a 5300 base DNA genome, characteristic protein composition, and density (1405 g/mL). .

2267,Application of enteric viruses for the monitoring of sources of fecal contamination in environmental waters,"Microbial Source Tracking (MST) tools are used to identify sources of fecal contamination to accurately assess public health risk and implement best management practices (BMPs). This review focuses on the potential of enteric viruses for MST applications. After host infection, enteric viruses replicate and are excreted in large numbers in the feces and urine of hosts. Due to the specificity in host infection, enteric viruses have been considered one of the most accurate library- and culture-independent MST tools. In an evaluation of molecular viral assays based on sensitivity, specificity, and target virus density in stool-impacted samples, human adenovirus and human polyomavirus were found to be the most promising human-specific viral markers. However, more research is needed to identify promising viral markers for cattle due to cross-reactions that were observed between cattle species or the limited number of samples tested for specificity. Other viral markers of faecal origin, F+ RNA coliphage and pepper mild mottle virus, have also been proposed as potential targets for MST marker development. The last part of this review discusses the enhancement of the utility of enteric viruses for MST applications through next generation sequencing (NGS) and virus tipping technology. The massive sequence databases generated by shotgun and gene-targeted metagenomics allow for more efficient and reliable design of MST assays. Finally, recent studies revealed that alternative virus concentration methodologies may be more cost-effective than standard technologies such as 1MDS; however, improvements in recovery efficiency and consistency are still needed. Overall, advances in metagenomic information combined with efficient concentration methodologies as well as high host specificity make enteric viruses a promising tool in MST applications. © 2012 .",,"Wong, K.;Fong, T.

2268,Cloning and complete cDNA sequencing of classical swine fever virus strain LPC,"Classical swine fever virus (LPC vaccine strain) cDNAs were cloned by transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and their nucleotide sequences determined. In this work we obtained the sequence information of the 786 bases of the 5”-terminal region, 6049 bases of the middle region and 1648 bases of the 3”-terminal region. Taking our previous results and the current data together, the complete genomic sequence of the LPC strain (12344 nucleotides in length) was completed. The LPC genome has a large open reading frame that can encode a polypeptide of 3897 amino acids and is flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs), 373 bases at the 5″ end and 278 bases at the 3″ end. Phylogenetic analysis based on genomic sequences of several viruses suggested that the LPC strain is closest to the Chinese, Riems, HCLV, Alfort/187, Brescia, and Alfort strains in order. After further analysis, we found a 13-nucleotide insertion, TTT(C/T)CTTTTTTTT, in the 3â€²-UTR of LPC, Chinese, and HCLV strains. Immediately after 13 nucleotides, a unique LPC sequence consisting of 28 thymidines was observed.",,"Wong, M. L.;Peng, B. Y.;Liu, J. J.;Chang, T. J.",2001.0,,10.1023/a:1011856608580,0
2269,Neutralization of DNA aptamers against H3N2 swine influenza viruses,"Triple reassortant influenza A viruses (IAVs) from swine, particularly the North American H3N2 subtype, circulate in herds and can reassort and cause the emergence of new zoonotic strains. Current diagnostic tools rely on virus isolation followed by hemagglutination serotyping or genome sequencing, which can be costly and time-consuming. Therefore, novel subtype-specific methods and ligands are needed to rapidly test and subtype IAV in the field. To address this need, we screened DNA aptamers against porcine IAV H3 group IV recombinant HA protein using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Four candidate aptamers (HA68, HA7, HA2a and HA2b) were identified and characterized. The dissociation constants (Kd) of the HA68, HA7, HA2a and HA2b aptamers against the recombinant H3 protein were 7.1, 22.3, 16.0 and 3.7 nM, respectively. The binding site of HA68 to H3 was identified to be between nucleotide residues 8 and 40. All aptamers inhibited hemagglutination of H3. HA68 was highly specific for all four lineages within the North American H3N2 subtype. Furthermore, the other three aptamers specifically identified live viruses belonging to phylogenetic groups I, II/III and IV, especially the virus that is closely related to the recent variant H3N2 (H3N2v). The HA68 aptamer was also able to bind to and detect H3N2v isolated from recent human cases. In conclusion, we provide subtype-specific aptamers against pig H3N2 IAVs that can now be used in rapid detection and typing protocols for field applications.

2270,Metagenomic analysis of viromes from dromedary camel fecal samples reveals a large number and diversity of circoviruses and picobirnaviruses,"The recent discovery of the Middle East respiratory coronavirus and another dromedary camel novel coronavirus UAE-HKU23 in dromedaries has increased interest in searching for new viruses in dromedaries. In this study, faecal samples from 203 dromedary camels in Dubai were pooled and deeply sequenced. Among the 7,330 viral contigs assembled, 1,970 were assigned to mammalian viruses. The largest groups of these contigs coincided with the Picobirnaviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Astroviridae, and Hepeviridae. Many of these viral families were previously unknown to dromedaries. In addition to the high abundance of Circoviridae (n=598 with 14 complete genomes) and Picobirnaviridae (n=1236) contigs, a high diversity of contigs from these two families was found, with the 14 Circoviridae complete genomes forming at least five groups. . and potentially novel picobirnavirus contigs from both genogroup I and genogroup II.

2271,High diversity of genogroup I picobirnaviruses in mammals,"In a molecular epidemiology study using 791 faecal samples collected from different terrestrial and marine mammals in Hong Kong, genogroup I picobirnaviruses (PBVs) were positive by RT-PCR targeting the partial RdRp gene in samples from five cattle, six monkeys, 17 horses, nine pigs, one rabbit, one dog, and 12 California sea lions, with 11, 9, 23, 17, 1, 1, and 15 sequence types in the positive specimens of the corresponding animals, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PBV sequences from each animal type were widely distributed throughout the tree with high diversity, sharing 47.4-89.0% nucleotide identities with other genogroup I PBV strains based on the partial RdRp gene. Nine full segments 1 (viral loads from 1.7 x 10(4) to 5.9 x 10(6)/mL) and 15 segments 2 (viral loads from 4.1 x 10(3) to 1.3 x 10 Serially collected fecal samples from California sea lions were sequenced for otarine PBV (6)/ml). In the two phylogenetic trees constructed with ORF2 and ORF3 from segment 1, the nine segment 1 sequences clustered into four distinct clades (C1-C4). In the tree constructed using the segment 2 RdRp gene, the 15 segment 2 sequences were grouped into nine distinct clades (R1-R9). In four sea lions, PBVs were detected in two different years, with the same Glade segment 1 (C3) present in two consecutive years from one sea lion and different clades present in different years from three sea lions. A great diversity of PBVs was observed in a variety of terrestrial and marine mammals.

2272,Resolution of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus Subtypes from Persistently Infected US Beef Calves with Whole Genome Sequencing,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is classified into 2 genotypes, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, each of which contains different subtypes with genetic and antigenic variation. To effectively control BVDV through vaccination, it is important to know which subtypes of the virus are circulating and how their prevalence changes over time. Accordingly, the purpose of our study was to estimate the current prevalence and subtype diversity of BVDV from persistently infected (PI) beef calves in the central United States. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5'-UTR (5'-untranslated region) for 119 virus strains revealed that the majority (82%) belonged to genotype 1b, and the remaining strains were distributed between genotypes 1a (9%) and 2 (8%). ; however, the BVDV-2 subtypes could not be resolved with certainty. Therefore, to better define the variability of US BVDV isolates and further investigate the division of BVDV-2 isolates into subtypes, full genomic sequences were obtained for these isolates as well as representatives of BVDV -1a and -1b. Phylogenetic analyzes of the complete coding sequence provided a more conclusive genetic classification and revealed that US BVDV-2 isolates belong to at least 3 distinct genetic groups that are statistically supported by analyzes of individual and complete coding genes. . These results show that a more complex set of BVDV-2 subtypes have been circulating in this region than previously thought.",,"Workman, A. M.;Heaton, M. P.;Harhay, G. P.;Smith, T.

To estimate the potential risk, we sequentially passaged the A/Hamburg/04/2009 isolate on A549 human lung epithelial cells. After passage 6, we observed a 100-fold higher replication rate. High-throughput sequencing of viral gene segments identified five dominant mutations, whose contribution to increased growth was analyzed by reverse genetics. Increased replication rate was identified with two mutations within the hemagglutinin (HA) gene segment (HA1 D130E, HA2 I91L), near the receptor binding site and stem domain. The adapted virus also replicated more efficiently in mice in vivo. The enhanced replication rate correlated with a higher HA protein fusion pH and a decrease in receptor affinity.

2275,Does the complexity of the rumen microbial ecology preclude methane mitigation?,"Ruminant livestock are responsible for the production of a part of greenhouse gases, in particular methane (61 Tg/year), which is believed to contribute to global warming and climate change. Methane is an end product of the fermentation of plant material by the microbial ecosystem in the rumen. Methanogenesis is carried out by methanogenic archaea and is a mechanism by which H(2) is removed from fermentation to regenerate biochemical cofactors such as NAD+. The microbial ecosystem is very complex and involves thousands of species of bacteria (10(10)-10(11) cells/ml), archaea (10(7)-10(9) cells/ml), protozoa (10(4) -10(6) cells/ml), fungi (10(3)-10(6) cells/ml), and viruses (10(9)-10(10) cells/ml), which interact with food, their host and each other. This ecosystem is relatively poorly understood, particularly the interactions between species and the interactions with the host. Less than 15% of the microbial species of the gastrointestinal tract have been cultured and characterized. However, knowledge of this ecosystem is accumulating, particularly with the advent of molecular biology and culture-independent technologies. New high-throughput sequencing methodologies such as pyrosequencing will greatly improve the rate of knowledge acquisition, and techniques such as stable isotope probing will improve our ability to understand interrelationships of species. While we can expect an increase in our knowledge of this complex ecosystem and an improved ability to predictably reduce CH(4) emissions, examples of successful reductions already exist, including the use of feed (e.g., corn grains). cereals) and chemical additives (eg, 2-bromoethane sulfonate, bromochloromethane). Achieving significant reductions in CH(4) emissions may be possible with advances in our understanding of the complexities of this complex ecosystem.

2276,Molecular characterization of influenza A H1N1 viruses from human cases in North America,"Influenza virus subtypes H1N1 can be found in humans in North America, while they are also associated with infection of pigs. Characterization of the genotypes of viral strains in human populations is important to understand the origin and distribution of viral strains. Genomic and protein sequences of 10 isolates from the 2009 North American influenza A (H1N1) outbreak were obtained from the GenBank database. To characterize the genotypes of these viruses, phylogenetic trees of the PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, NS and M genes were constructed using the Phylip3.67 program and N-Linked glycosylation sites of HA, NA, PB2, NS1 and M2 proteins were analyzed online using the program NetNGlyc1.0. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these isolates are virtually identical but may be recombinant viruses because their genomic fragments come from different viruses. The isolates also contain a characteristic low pathogenicity amino acid motif at their HA cleavage sites (IPSIQSRa dagger""GL) and an E residue at position 627 of the PB2 protein showing its high affinity for humans. The homologous model of M proteins showed that the viruses had obtained anti-amantadine ability due to mutation in the drug-sensitive site, while sequence analysis of NA proteins indicated that the viruses are still susceptible to the neuraminidase-inhibiting drug (ie. say, oseltamivir and zanamivir) because no mutations have been detected Our results strongly suggested that the viruses responsible for the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus outbreaks have the ability to cross species barriers to infect humans and animals mammals based on molecular analysis.These findings may further facilitate therapy and prevention of possible transmission from North America to other countries. session",,"Wu, B.;Wang, C.

2277,"Genetic and Molecular Characterization of H9N2 and H5 Avian Influenza Viruses from Live Bird Markets in Zhejiang Province, East China","Live poultry markets (LPM) are a key source of mixed avian influenza viruses (AIVs) due to the density of land and waterfowl and the frequency of infection by AIV. H9N2 viruses are prevalent in terrestrial poultry throughout Asia and have been isolated from poultry outbreaks around the world. They infect both bird and mammalian species and may be important donors of genetic material for emerging human pathogens. LPMs in Zhejiang province were surveyed between 2013 and 2014 for AIV. Three hundred and seventy-four (374) AIV strains were isolated from 3,328 samples. Phylogenetic and whole genome sequencing analyzes were performed. We identified a novel H9N2 virus genotype that had rearranged with Qa/HK/G1/97-like, Ck/BJ/1/94-like, and Dk/HK/Y439/97-like virus gene segments. Phylogenetic analyzes suggested that H9N2 viruses had reassorted with other AIV subtypes. The results also suggested that two different clades (2.3.2 and 2.3.4.6) of H5 viruses circulated simultaneously in Zhejiang province. Since AIV H5 reassortants have been detected in geese and ducks, it is possible that apparently healthy birds contribute to the appearance of AIV H5.

However, its mechanism involving microRNAs (miRNAs) is still poorly understood. Deep sequencing was used to explore the IFN-t miRNA-specific library in bovine endometrial epithelial cells (bEEC). The results showed that 574 known bovine miRNAs and 109 new miRNAs were identified. We found 74 differentially expressed miRNAs, including 30 commonly expressed miRNAs in the experiment. Then, qPCR verification of six selected miRNAs showed that they matched the sequencing data. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed a significant enrichment of predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs, including influenza A, herpes simplex infection, processing and antigen presentation, viral myocarditis, the TNF signaling pathway, graft versus host disease, and allograft rejection.

Here we have determined the 5” UTR and adjacent 289 nt sequences, and the 3” UTR sequences, for six group 2 coronaviruses and compared them with each other and with three previously reported group 2 members. Large regions of highly similar UTR sequences were found, but small regions of divergence were also found indicating that group 2 coronaviruses could be subdivided into those that are similar to bovine coronavirus (BCoV) (BCoV, human respiratory coronavirus-OC43, enteric coronavirus human, porcine hemagglutinating coronavirus, encephalomyelitis virus, and equine coronavirus) and those that are similar to murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (MHV strains A59, 2, and JHM, puffinosis virus, and rat sialodacrioadenitis virus). It has been previously shown that the 3â€² UTRs of BCoV and MHV are interchangeable. Here, a reporter-containing BCoV DI RNA was shown to be replicated by all five BCoV-like helper viruses and by MHV-H2 (a human cell-adapted MHV strain), a representative of the MHV-like subgroup, thus demonstrates common group 2 5” and 3” replication signaling elements. BCoV DI RNA additionally acquired the leader from HCoV-OC43 via leader switching, demonstrating for the first time in vivo recombination between animal and human coronavirus molecules. These results indicate that common replication signaling elements exist among group 2 coronaviruses despite a two-group pattern within the group and imply that a high potential for recombination might exist between group members. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

2280,"Effect of Live Poultry Market Interventions on Influenza A(H7N9) Virus, Guangdong, China","Since March 2013, three waves of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been detected in China. To investigate virus transmission within and between epidemic waves, we used surveillance data and whole-genome analysis of viruses sampled in Guangdong during 2013-2015. We observed a geographic shift in human A(H7N9) infections from the second to the third wave. Interventions were carried out in the live bird market in epicenter cities; however, spatial phylogenetic analysis indicated that the third wave outbreaks in central Guangdong were likely due to local virus persistence and not introduction from elsewhere. Although the number of human clinical cases decreased by 35% from the second to the third wave, the genetic diversity of the third wave viruses in Guangdong increased. Our results highlight the epidemic risk for a region that reports comparatively few A(H7N9) cases. Furthermore, our results suggest that interventions in the live bird market cannot completely stop the persistence and spread of the A(H7N9) virus.",,"Wu, J.;Lu, J.;Faria, N.

2281,"Molecular detection of hepatitis E virus in sheep from southern Xinjiang, China","Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a causal agent of infectious hepatitis in animals and humans, both in developing and developed countries. Here, we collected 500 sheep sera and 75 raw sheep liver samples from a slaughterhouse in the southern part of the Xinjiang region, China, along with 26 sera from butchers from the same slaughterhouse. All serum samples were tested for anti-HEV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both serum and liver samples were tested for the presence of HEV RNA by nested polymerase chain reaction targeting partial open reading frame 2 (ORF2) nucleotide sequences. The results indicate that the seroprevalence of sheep was 35.20% (176/500) and that four of 75 (5.3%) sheep livers showed detectable amounts of HEV RNA. The seroprevalence of butchers was 57.7% (15/26). The four amplicons shared 97.8 to 100% nucleotide sequence identity and had pairwise sequence identities of 81.6 to 85.3%, 84.2 to 85.3%, 82.1 to 85%. 0.3% and 84.7 to 97.9% with the corresponding regions of HEV genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on alignments of an amplified 186 bp ORF2 sequence and the corresponding reference strains. Analysis showed that the four sheep strains detected in our study formed a lineage within a genotype 4 cluster containing hb-3, bjsw1, T1, swCH189, and swCH25, all of which belong to genotype 4, subtype 4d. The results indicated a high level of seroconversion in sheep and suggested that sheep liver may be a source of foodborne HEV infection in humans.",,"Wu, J.;Si, F.;Jiang, C.;Li, T.;Jin, M.",2015.0,,10.1007/s11262-015-1194-9,0
2282,High-throughput sequencing of the pituitary and hypothalamic microRNA transcriptome associated with a high rate of egg production,"Background: MicroRNAs exist widely in viruses, plants, and animals. As small endogenous non-coding RNAs, miRNAs regulate a variety of biological processes. Tissue miRNA expression studies have uncovered numerous functions for miRNAs in various chicken tissues, but regulation of miRNAs in chicken pituitary and hypothalamic development related to high and low egg-laying performance remains elusive. clear. Results: In this study, using high-throughput sequencing technology, we sequenced two tissues (pituitary and hypothalamus) in 3 high-rate and 3 low-rate Luhua chickens at the age of 300 days. Comparing chickens of low and high rate egg production, 46 known miRNAs and 27 new miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed (P < 0.05). Six known differentially expressed miRNAs, which are expressed in both tissues, were used in RT-qPCR validation and SNP detection. Among them, seven SNPs were found in two miRNA precursors (gga-miR1684a and gga-miR-1434) that could enhance or reduce the production of mature miRNAs. In addition, 124 and 30 reciprocally expressed miRNA-target pairs were identified by RNA-seq in pituitary and hypothalamic tissues, respectively, and randomly selected miRNA-target and candidate miRNA pairs were validated by RT-qPCR in Jiuyuan black birds. . The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation illustrated that a large number of egg-laying-related pathways were enriched in high-rate egg-producing chickens, including ovarian steroidogenesis and the biosynthesis of steroid hormones. Conclusions: These differentially expressed miRNAs and their predicted target genes, especially the reciprocally expressed miRNA-target pairs, advance the study of miRNA function and the identification of miRNAs associated with egg production. Analysis of miRNA-related SNPs and their effects provided insights into the effects of SNPs on miRNA biogenesis and function. The data generated in this study will improve our understanding of miRNA regulation mechanisms in the laying process of hen eggs.",,"Wu, N.;Zhu, Q.;Chen, B. L.;Gao, J.;Xu, Z. X.;Li, D.

2283,Genetic diversity of Newcastle disease viruses isolated from domestic poultry species in eastern China during 2005-2008,"Seventy-nine Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) isolated from clinical samples of different poultry species, including chickens, pigeons (Columba livia), geese, and ostriches in eastern China during 2005-2008, were characterized biologically and phylogenetically. The results showed genetic diversity of these viruses: three class I viruses and one genotype I and 12 class II genotype II viruses circulating in chickens were avirulent; four genotype VIb viruses isolated from pigeons were moderately virulent; and two genotype III viruses and 57 genotype VIId viruses were highly virulent. The three class I viruses were further classified as genotypes 2 and 3. The very high F protein sequence identity of one genotype I virus with the Queensland V4 strain and 12 genotype II viruses with the La Sota strain indicated that these viruses originated from the two vaccine strains. Two genotype III viruses shared more than 99% sequence identity with the moderately virulent vaccine strain Mukteswar, but exhibited significantly higher virulence, suggesting that they evolved from the vaccine virus and that the Mukteswar vaccine should be banned in China. Fifty-seven of the 63 virulent NDVs in this study belonged to the VIId genotype, indicating its predominance in eastern China. Genotype VIId viruses could be classified into two subgroups. Four of the five NDV isolates from pigeons belonged to the VIb genotype, indicating their specific host preference. Both genotype VIb and VIId NDVs showed low amino acid similarity to vaccine strains currently used in China, implying an urgent need to develop better vaccines against the most prevalent NDVs in China.",,"Wu, S.;Wang, W.;Yao, C.;Wang, X.;Hu, S.;Cao, J.;Wu, Y.;Liu, W.;Liu, X.",2011.0,,10.1007/s00705-010-0851-5,0
2284,Molecular and antigenic characteristics of Newcastle disease virus isolates from domestic ducks in China,"Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most devastating diseases for the poultry industry. The causative agents of ND are virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), which are members of the Avulavirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae family. Waterfowl, such as ducks and geese, are generally considered potential reservoirs for NDV and may show little or no clinical signs when infected with viruses that are obviously virulent in chickens. However, ND outbreaks in domestic waterfowl have been frequently reported in many countries in the last decade. In this study, 18 NDV strains isolated from domestic ducks in southern and eastern China, between 2005 and 2013, were genetically and phylogenetically characterized. The complete genomes of these strains were sequenced and exhibited genome sizes of 15,186 nucleotides (nt) , 15,192. nt, and 15,198. nt, which follow the ""rule of six"" that is required for replication of NDV strains. Based on F protein cleavage site and pathogenicity tests in chickens, 17 of our NDV isolates were classified as lentegenic viruses and one was characterized as velogenic virus. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial F gene sequences and full genome sequences showed that there are at least four NDV genotypes circulating in domestic ducks; GD1, AH224, and AH209 belong to class II NDV genotypes VIId, Ib, and II, respectively, and the remaining 15 isolates belong to class I NDV genotype 1b. Cross-reactive hemagglutination inhibition tests showed that the antigenic relationship between NDV strains may be associated with their genotypes, rather than with their hosts. These results suggest that although these NDV isolates were from ducks, they still do not form a phylogenetic group because they come from the same species; however, they can play an important role in promoting the evolution of NDVs.",,"Wu, W.;Liu, H.;Zhang, T.;Han, Z.;Jiang, Y.;Xu, Q.;Shao, Y.;Li, H.;Kong, X.;Chen, H.;Liu, S.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.02.016,0
2285,DEF cells infected with virulent duck enteritis virus generate a unique pattern of viral microRNAs and a new set of host microRNAs,"Background: Duck enteritis virus (DEV) belongs to the Herpesviridae family and is an important epornitic agent causing economic losses in the waterfowl industry. The virulent (CHv) and attenuated (VAC) Chinese vaccines are two different pathogenic strains of DEV. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in viral infection. However, there is little information on miRNAs encoded by duck virulent enteritis virus (DEV). Results: Using high-throughput sequencing, we identified 39 mature viral miRNAs from CHv-infected duck embryo fibroblast cells. Compared to the 33 reported VAC-encoded miRNAs, only 13 miRNA sequences and 22 miRNA ""seed sequences"" were identical, and in this study 8 novel viral miRNAs were detected and confirmed by stem-loop RT-qPCR. Using RNAhybrid and PITA software, 38 CHv-encoded miRNAs were predicted to target 41 viral genes and form a complex regulatory network. Dual luciferase reporter assay (DLRA) confirmed that the viral dev-miR-D8-3p can directly target the 3'-UTR of the CHv US1 gene (p < 0.05). Gene ontology analysis on host target genes of viral miRNAs was mainly involved in biological regulation, cellular and metabolic processes. Furthermore, 598 novel duck-encoded miRNAs were detected in this study. Thirty-eight host miRNAs showed significant differential expression after CHv infection: 13 miRNAs were upregulated and 25 miRNAs were downregulated, which may affect viral replication in the host cell. Conclusions: These data suggested that CHv encoded a different set of microRNAs and formed a unique regulatory network compared to VAC. This is the first report of miRNA expression profiling of DEF and an analysis of these miRNA regulatory mechanisms during DEV infection. These data provide a basis for further exploring the regulatory roles of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of DEV infection and contribute to the understanding of CHv-host interaction at the miRNA level.",,"Wu, X.;Jia, R.;Zhou, J.;Wang, M.;Chen, S.;Liu, M.;Zhu, D.;Zhao, X.;Sun, K.;Yang, Q.;Wu, Y.;Yin, Z.;Chen, X.;Wang, J.;Cheng, A.",2018.0,,10.1186/s12917-018-1468-2,0

2287,A new high-throughput multiplex polymerase chain reaction system based on capillary electrophoresis for the simultaneous detection of nine pathogens in pigs,"Here our aim was to develop a high-throughput multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system based on capillary electrophoresis for the simultaneous detection of nine pathogens in pigs. Nine pairs of specific primers and one set of universal primers were designed; multiplex PCR was established. The specificity and cross-reactivity of this assay were examined and the limit of detection was determined using serial 10-fold dilutions of plasmids containing the target sequences. The assay was further tested using 144 clinical samples. We found that all nine specific amplification peaks were observed and that the assay had a high degree of specificity, with no non-specific amplification. The simultaneous detection limit for all nine viruses reached 10,000 Î¼L-1 copies when all premixed viral targets were present. Seventy-seven of the clinical samples tested positive for at least one of the viruses; the main viral infections in clinical samples were porcine circovirus type 2 and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.

2288,Molecular Characteristics of Avian Influenza (H9N2) Viruses Derived from Air Samples at Live Bird Markets,"Objective: To study the molecular characteristics of H9N2 subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) isolated from air samples collected at live bird markets (LPM) and to explore their sequence identities with AIVs that caused human infection. Methods: Weekly surveillance for AIV of subtype H9N2 in LPM air was conducted from 2015 to 2016. H9-positive samples were isolated from chicken embryos. Whole genome sequences of isolated AIVs were obtained by high-throughput sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis and key loci variations of the sequences were further explored. Results: A total of 327 LPM aerosol samples were collected. Nine samples were positive for AIV of the H9 subtype by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRRT-PCR). According to whole genome sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis, except for strain A/Environment/Zhongshan/ZS201505/2015 (ZS201505), 8 gene segments from 8 aerosol H9N2 isolates and 2 human H9N2 isolates in 2015 were placed in the same clade. Among key loci variations, with the exception of strain ZS201505, AIVs of the H9N2 subtype did not have mutations in eight hemagglutinin (HA) receptor binding sites, and stems of neuraminidase (NA) proteins exhibited one deletion site. of three bases. The PA gene of ZS201503 and ZS201602 exhibited a L336M mutation. Mutations N30D and T215A in the M1 gene and amino acid residues L89V in PB2, P42S in NS1, and S31N in M2 were maintained in these 9 strains of H9N2 isolates, which could increase the virulence of the virus. Conclusion: Live H9N2 AIVs survived in the LPM aerosol in Zhongshan City. Aerosolized viruses had a close evolutionary relationship to human epidemic strains, indicating that there could be a risk of transmission of AIV to humans from contaminated aerosols in LPM. Mutations in AIVs of the H9N2 subtype isolated from air samples collected from LPM suggested that their pathogenicity was increased to infect humans.",,"Wu, Y.;Lin, J.;Yang, S.;Xie, Y.;Wang, M.;Chen, X.;Zhu, Y.;Luo, L.;Shi, W.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2018.01.009,0
2289,Pseudorabies virus-infected porcine epithelial cell line generates a diverse set of host microRNAs and a special group of viral microRNAs,"Pseudorabies virus (PRV) belongs to the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily that causes huge economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. It has recently been shown that many herpesviruses encode microRNAs (miRNAs), which play a crucial role in the viral life cycle. However, knowledge about PRV-encoded miRNAs is still limited. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of both viral and host miRNA expression profiles in the PRV-infected porcine epithelial cell line (PK-15). Deep sequencing data showed that the ~4.6 kb intron of the long latency transcript (LLT) functions as a primary microRNA precursor (pri-miRNA) encoding a pool of 11 distinct miRNAs in the PRV genome, and 209 known and 39 new porcine miRNAs were detected. Viral miRNAs were further confirmed by stem-loop RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis. Interestingly, all of these viral miRNAs exhibited terminal heterogeneity at both the 5' and 3' ends. Seven miRNA genes produced mature miRNAs from both arms and two of the viral miRNA genes partially overlapped in their precursor regions. Unexpectedly, a small terminal loop-derived RNA with high abundance and a special miRNA-displaced RNA (mRNA) were processed from the same viral miRNA precursor. Polymorphisms of viral miRNAs shed light on the complexity of the host miRNA processing machinery and the regulatory mechanism of viral miRNA. Porcine genes and PRV genes were harvested for target prediction of viral miRNAs, revealing a complex network made up of viral and host genes. GO enrichment analysis of host target genes suggests that PRV miRNAs are involved in complex cellular pathways including cell death, immune system processing, and metabolic pathway, indicating that these miRNAs play an important role in the virus-cell interaction of PRV and its hosts. Taken together, these data suggest that the PRV-infected epithelial cell line generates a diverse set of host miRNAs and a special group of viral miRNAs, which could facilitate PRV replication in cells.",,"Wu, Y.

2290,Discovery of various rodent and bat pestiviruses with distinct genomic and phylogenetic characteristics in various Chinese provinces,"Bats and rodents are widely distributed throughout the world and can be native or intermediate reservoirs for many important zoonotic viruses. Pestiviruses are a group of virus species in the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae that can infect a wide variety of artiodactyl hosts, including pigs and ruminants. Two classical types of pestiviruses, bovine viral diarrhea virus and classical swine fever virus, are important causative agents of mild to severe disease in bovine and swine hosts, respectively, causing enormous economic losses in these industries. Recent reports revealed that bats and rodents could also act as natural hosts for pestiviruses and an atypical swine pestivirus, which causes disease in piglets, showed a close genetic relationship to a specific bat pestivirus, RaPestV-1. This study aimed to describe the detection and characterization of novel bat and rodent pestiviruses in different locations by analyzing available bat and rodent virome data from all over China. Two bat pestivirus species and four rodent pestivirus species that are distinct from other known viruses were identified and sequenced. These viruses were identified in two bat species and four rodent species in different Chinese provinces. There were two distinct lineages present in these viruses, differing from artiodactyl pestivirus. These findings further our understanding of the genetic diversity of pestiviruses in bats and rodents and suggest the presence of a diverse set of pestiviruses in non-artiodactyl hosts.

2291,Deciphering the bat virome catalog to better understand the ecological diversity of bat viruses and the origin of emerging infectious diseases in bats,"Studies have shown that ~60%-80% of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) in humans originate in wildlife. Bats are natural reservoirs for a wide variety of viruses, including many important zoonotic viruses that cause serious disease in humans and domestic animals. However, understanding of the viral population and ecological diversity that resides in bat populations is unclear, complicating the determination of the origins of certain EIDs. Here, using bats as a typical wildlife reservoir model, virome analysis was performed based on pharyngeal and anal swab samples from 4440 bat individuals from 40 major bat species across China. The purpose of this study was to study the ecological and biological diversities of viruses residing in these bat species, to investigate the presence of potential bat-borne zoonotic viruses, and to assess the public health impacts of these viruses. The data obtained in this study revealed an overview of the viral community present in these bat samples. Many new bat viruses were reported for the first time, and some bat viruses closely related to known human or animal pathogens were identified.

This study aimed to describe the range of bat viromes, including mammalian, insect, fungal, plant, and phage viruses, in 11 species of insectivorous bats (216 bats in total) common in six provinces of China. To analyze the viromes, we used sequence-independent PCR amplification and state-of-the-art sequencing technology (Solexa Genome Analyzer II; Illumina). Viromes were identified by sequence similarity comparisons with known viruses. Mammalian viruses included Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Retroviridae, Circoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Astroviridae, Flaviridae, Coronaviridae, Picornaviridae, and Parvovirinae; insect viruses included those of the Baculoviridae, Iflaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Tetraviridae, and Densovirinae; fungal viruses included those of the Chrysoviridae, Hypoviridae, Partitiviridae, and Totiviridae; and phages included those of Caudovirales, Inoviridae and Microviridae and unclassified phages. In addition to viruses and phages associated with insects, plants, and bacterial flora related to the diet and habitat of bats, we identified the complete or partial genomic sequences of 13 novel mammalian viruses. These included herpesviruses, papillomaviruses, a circovirus, a bocavirus, picornaviruses, a pestivirus, and a foamy virus. Pairwise alignments and phylogenetic analyzes indicated that these new viruses showed little genetic similarity to previously reported viruses. This study also revealed a high prevalence and diversity of bat astroviruses and coronaviruses in some provinces.

The illness resembles the common cold caused by rhinoviruses in humans; however, the presence of viremia during VRE-1 infection, the occurrence of persistent infections, and the physical properties are more reminiscent of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Cloning and cDNA sequencing of the ERV-1 and ERV-2 genomes between the poly(C) and poly(A) tracts showed that the serotypes are heterogeneous. However, the genomic architecture of both serotypes is very similar to that of foot-and-mouth disease virus. In fact, a comparison of protein sequences derived from ERV-1 shows its highest identity with FMDV. In contrast, most ERV-2 proteins are more closely related to encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) proteins than to foot-and-mouth disease virus or ERV-1. These results place ERV-1 together with FMD virus in the genus Aphthovirus of the picornavirus family and indicate that this virus can serve as a model system to examine the biology of FMD virus.",,"Wutz, G.;Auer, H.;Nowotny, N.;Grosse, B.;Skern, T.;Kuechler, E.",1996.0,,,0

2298,Comparative transcriptomics highlights the role of activator protein transcription factor 1 in the host response to Ebola virus,"Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus comprise two genera of negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that cause severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans. Despite considerable research efforts, the molecular events that follow Ebola virus (EBOV) infection are poorly understood. In order to identify host factors underpinning EBOV pathogenesis, we compared the transcriptomes of EBOV-infected human, pig, and bat kidney cells using a transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) approach. Despite a significant difference in viral transcription/replication between cell lines, all cells responded to EBOV infection through a strong induction of extracellular growth factors. In addition, significant upregulation of activator protein 1 (AP1) transcription factor complex members FOS and JUN were observed in permissive cell lines. Functional studies focused on human cells showed that EBOV infection induces protein expression, phosphorylation, and nuclear accumulation of JUN and, to a lesser extent, FOS. Using a luciferase-based reporter, we show that EBOV infection induces AP1 transactivation activity within human cells at 48 and 72 h post-infection. Finally, we show that JUN knockdown decreases EBOV-induced host gene expression. Taken together, our study highlights the role of AP1 in promoting the host gene expression profile that defines EBOV pathogenesis.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Many questions remain about the molecular events underlying the pathophysiology of filovirus. The rational design of new intervention strategies, such as post-exposure therapy, will be significantly improved through a deep understanding of these molecular events. We believe that new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of EBOV are possible by examining the transcriptomic response of taxonomically diverse cell lines (derived from humans, pigs, and bats). We first identified response pathways using an RNA-seq-based transcriptomics approach. Further functional and computational analysis focused on human cells highlighted an important role for the transcription factor AP1 in mediating the transcriptional response to EBOV infection. Our study sheds new light on how host transcription factors respond to and promote the transcriptional landscape following viral infection.",,"Wynne, J.

In this study, a Bayesian approach was leveraged to analyze five genetic regions of the BVDV genome (5â€² UTR, Npro, E2a, E2b, and NS3) for 68 taxa retrieved from GenBank. The results showed that all taxa in the E2a consensus tree have been correctly assigned to the corresponding groups, i.e. BVDV type 2 and BVDV-1a, -1b, -1c, -1e and -1g, supported by a high posterior probability. In contrast, subgroup 1a formed polytomies in the 5â€² UTR and NS3 consensus trees. Polytomies also appeared between the 1b subgroup in the Npro and E2b consensus trees. Analysis of a matched dataset produced an unequivocal and well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis. The topologies found for each genetic region separately and combined were different, but the differences were mainly weakly supported by the data. Combining the data allowed the identification of well-supported strain clades corresponding to some of the previously defined subgroups. Only a combined approach will allow the safe placement of new strains in the current classification of viruses in genotype and subgenotype. © 2007 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Xia, H.;Liu, L.;Wahlberg, N.;Baule, C.;BelÃ¡k, S.",2007.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2007.05.017,0
2301,"Sequence analysis of peste des petits ruminants virus from ibexes in Xinjiang, China","Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an infectious disease caused by the peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV). Although PPR primarily affects domestic goats and sheep, it also affects wild ungulates such as ibex, blue sheep, and gazelle, although there are few reports of PPRV infection in wild animals. Between January 2015 and February 2015, wild ibex were found to have died of PPRV infection for the first time in Bazhou, Xinjiang, China, where a total of 38 ibex (including young ibex and adults) had died abnormally from PPR-related issues. First, we analyzed the presence of the PPRV F gene by RT-PCR. We then compared the sequence of the F gene isolated from the ibex strain, named PPRV Xinjiang/Ibex/2015, with those previously identified from domestic small ruminants from local areas near where the reported isolate was collected, as well as with those from other regions. The current sequence was phylogenetically classified as a lineage IV virus and shared a high level of sequence identity (99.7%) with a previously described PPRV isolate from Xinjiang.",,"Xia, J.;Zheng, X.

2302,"Transmission of Newcastle disease virus from poultry to wild birds in Guangdong province, South China","Despite intensive vaccination programs in many countries, including China, Newcastle disease has been reported sporadically and remains a major threat to the poultry industry in China. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is infectious for at least 250 bird species, but the role of wild birds in the epidemiology of the virus remains largely unknown. Fourteen NDV isolates were obtained from 2,040 samples collected from wild birds or the environment in Guangdong province, southern China, between 2013 and 2015. The isolation rate was the highest in the wintering period and the lowest. low during spring migration, nesting, and post-nesting periods A top-credibility phylogenetic analysis of the clade revealed that at least four genotypes circulate in southern China: three class II genotypes (II, VI, and IX) and one class II genotype (II, VI, and IX). class I (1b). We also showed that most wild bird isolates were highly similar to poultry isolates, and two isolates were linked to wild bird viruses in northern China. These data suggested that wild birds could spread NDV and that poultry-derived viruses could spread to wild birds. Consequently, vaccine development and poultry management strategies should be considered to prevent future NDV outbreaks, particularly given the strength of the poultry industry in developing countries, such as China.",,"Xiang, B.;Han, L.;Gao, P.;You, R.;Wang, F.;Xiao, J.;Liao, M.;Kang, Y.;Ren, T.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2017.09.020,0

Chromosomal translocations involved in the NPM gene have been found in patients with anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). To generate knockout mice for the NPM gene and study their biological function in vivo, we screened the genomic library of lambda phage derived from 129S1 mice with mouse NPM cDNA probe. A positive phage clone containing the full length NPM genomic DNA was obtained and the 15.3 kb genomic DNA insert in this clone was sequenced by the shotgun method. BLAST analysis showed that the sequence of the insert has 99.8% identity with that of the NPM gene from mouse strain C57BL/6. Based on the sequence, bioinformatic analyzes were performed on the genomic structure of NPM and the transcription factor binding sites in the 5' flanking region of NPM.",,"Xiang, Y. G.;Lu, S.

2304,Characterization of the highly prevalent porcine parvovirus type 2 (PPV2) in the US.,"new porcine parvovirus designated porcine parvovirus 2 (PPV2) was initially identified in Myanmar in 2001, in China during 2006-2007, and in Hungary in 2012. To investigate the presence and prevalence of PPV2 in the US, the timely PCR method was developed and used for a PPV2 survey using 483 lung samples, 185 fecal samples, and 122 sera collected from pigs on 295 farms in 18 US states. The global prevalence of PPV2 was 20.7% (100/483 ) in lung samples and 7.6% (14/185) in fecal samples obtained from pigs of different age groups, and 1.6% (2/122) in sera or thoracic fluids obtained from neonatal pigs. Further comparison of genomic sequences showed that the 2011 US PPV2 sequences have 95.4-97.7% nucleotide identities with the 2006-2007 strains detected in China, while the nucleotide identity was 94.7% with the 2001 strain detected in Myanmar, indicating persistent evolution of the virus.

2305,Molecular evolutionary genetic analysis of emerging parvoviruses identified in pigs,"Parvoviruses infect a wide variety of vertebrates and arthropods and are associated with various clinical manifestations. Due to the advent of new sequence-independent PCR methods and high-throughput sequencing, several new members of parvovirus within the Parvovirinae subfamily have recently been described. Several of these viruses do not fit into the current classification and others now have confusing or contradictory nomenclature because two or more names were used for similar or identical groups of parvoviruses or identical names were used for different groups of viruses. In this study, recently described vertebrate parvoviruses, with an emphasis on those identified in pigs, were classified by phylogenetic analyzes based on their complete or nearly complete genome sequences, open reading frame (ORF) 1 (nonstructural protein, NS1 ), ORF2 (capsid protein, VP1) and ORF3 (nuclear phosphoprotein, NP1) genes by using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Maximum Likelihood (ML), and Neighbor-Joining (NJ) methods. Among all available vertebrate parvovirus sequences, eight distinct clades were identified, corresponding to the five well-established genera Parvovirus, Erythrovirus, Denpendovirus, Amdovirus, and Bocavirus. In addition, three new clades were identified and tentatively designated as PARV4-like viruses, novel clade 1 and novel clade 2. Parvoviruses in swine were found to be distributed in four different clades, including Parvovirus, Bocavirus, PARV4-like virus and the novel clade 2. All porcine parvoviruses identified to date were organized based on the current analysis. The present analysis will help to clarify the nomenclature of parvoviruses in pigs and will facilitate the future uniform assignment of names for new parvoviruses within the subfamily Parvovirinae. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",,"Xiao, C.

2306,Identification and classification of endogenous retroviruses in cattle,"The objective of this study was to identify the sequences of endogenous retroviruses (ERV) in a bovine genome. We subjected bovine genomic DNA to PCR with primers specific for the ovine or degenerate ERV (OERV) family that aimed to amplify the retroviral pro/pol region. Sequence analysis of 113 clones obtained by PCR revealed that 69 were of retroviral origin. Based on the OERV classification system, these degenerate PCR clones could be divided into the Î²3, Î³4 and Î³9 families. PCR with OERV family-specific primers revealed an additional ERV that was classified into the γ7 family of bovine endogenous retroviruses (BERV). In conclusion, here we report the results of a genome-wide study of BERV. Our study shows that the expansion of the ERV family in cattle may be somewhat limited, while more diverse ERV family members have been reported from other artiodactyls, such as pigs and sheep.

2307,Understanding PRRSV infection in porcine lung based on genome-wide transcriptome response identified by deep sequencing,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) has been one of the most economically important diseases affecting the swine industry worldwide, causing large economic losses every year. PRRS virus (PRRSV) replicates mainly in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) and dendritic cells (DC) and develops persistent infections, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), interstitial pneumonia, and immunosuppression. But the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV infection are still poorly understood. Here we report the first genome-wide host transcriptional responses to classic North American type PRRSV (N-PRRSV) strain CH 1a infection using the Solexa/Illumina digital gene expression (DGE) system, a method of tag-based high-throughput transcriptome sequencing. and systematically analyze the relationship between lung gene expression profiles after N-PRRSV infection and the pathology of the infection. Our results suggest that N-PRRSV appeared to use multiple strategies for its replication and spread in infected pigs, including subversion of the host's innate immune response, induction of an anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory state, and development of ADE. The upregulation of virus-induced proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory enzymes and inflammatory cells, antibodies, and complement activation is likely to result in the development of inflammatory responses during N-PRRSV infection. N-PRRSV-induced immunosuppression could be mediated by apoptosis of infected cells, leading to depletion of immune cells and inducing an anti-inflammatory cytokine response in which they were unable to eradicate the primary infection. Our systems analysis will benefit from a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of N-PRRSV infection, the development of new antiviral therapies, and the identification of genetic components for porcine resistance/susceptibility to PRRS. © 2010 Xiao et al.",,"Xiao, S.;Jia, J.;Mo, D.;Wang, Q.;Qin, L.;He, Z.;Zhao, X.;Huang, Y.;Li, A.;Yu, J.;Niu, Y.;Liu, X.;Chen, Y.",2010.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0011377,0
2308,Aberrant Host Immune Response Induced by Highly Virulent PRRSV Identified by Digital Gene Expression Tag Profiling,"Background: There was a large-scale outbreak of highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in China and Vietnam during 2006 and 2007 that resulted in unusually high morbidity and mortality among pigs of all ages. The mechanisms underlying the molecular pathogenesis of highly virulent PRRS virus (H-PRRSV) remain unknown. Therefore, in this study, the relationship between lung gene expression profiles after H-PRRSV infection and infection pathology was analyzed by histopathology and deep high-throughput sequencing. Results: H-PRRSV infection caused severe pulmonary pathology. The results indicate that aberrant innate host immune responses to H-PRRSV and the induction of an anti-apoptotic state could be responsible for the aggressive replication and spread of H-PRRSV. The rapid and prolific replication of H-PRRSV could have triggered aberrant sustained expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that led to a markedly robust inflammatory response compounded by significant cell death and increased oxidative damage. The end result was severe tissue damage and high pathogenicity. Conclusions: The systems analysis used in this study provides a comprehensive foundation to better understand the pathogenesis of H-PRRSV. In addition, it allows identifying the genetic components involved in resistance/susceptibility to H-PRRSV in pig populations. © 2010 Xiao et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Xiao, S.;Mo, D.;Wang, Q.;Jia, J.;Qin, L.;Yu, X.;Niu, Y.;Zhao, X.;Liu, X.;Chen, Y.",2010.0,,10.1186/1471-2164-11-544,0
2309,"Reverse genetics generation of a live, stable and efficacious attenuated Newcastle disease virus vaccine based on a currently circulating highly virulent Indonesian strain","Newcastle disease virus (NDV) can cause severe disease in chickens. Although there are vaccines against NDV, there are frequent reports of outbreaks in vaccinated chickens. During 2009-2010, despite intensive vaccination, NDV caused major outbreaks in commercial poultry farms in Indonesia. These outbreaks raised concerns regarding the protective immunity of current vaccines against virulent strains circulating in Indonesia. In this study, we investigated whether a recombinant attenuated Indonesian NDV strain could provide better protection against predominant Indonesian viruses. A reverse genetics system was constructed for the highly virulent strain of NDV Banjarmasin/010/10 (Ban/010) isolated in Indonesia in 2010. Ban/010 virus is classified as NDV class II genotype VII, which is genetically distinct from the commercial vaccine strains B1 and LaSota, which belong to genotype II, and share only 89 and 87% amino acid identity for the protective F and HN antigens, respectively. A mutant virus, designated Ban/AF, was developed in which the virulent F protein cleavage site motif ""RRQKRâ†“F"" was modified to an avirulent motif ""GRQGRâ†“L"" by three amino acid substitutions (underlined ). Ban/AF vaccinia virus did not produce syncytia or plaques in cell culture, even in the presence of added protease. Pathogenicity tests showed that Ban/AF was completely avirulent. Ban/AF replicated efficiently over 10 consecutive passages in chickens and remained genetically stable. Serological analysis showed that Ban/AF induced higher neutralizing and hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers against the predominant viruses than the commercial B1 or LaSota vaccines. Both the Ban/AF vaccine and the commercial vaccine provided protection against clinical disease and mortality after challenge with the virulent strain of NDV Ban/010 (genotype VII) or GB Texas (genotype II). However, Ban/AF significantly reduced challenge virus shedding from vaccinated birds compared to the B1 vaccine. These results suggest that Ban/AF may provide better protection than commercial vaccines and is a promising candidate vaccine against NDV strains circulating in Indonesia.",,"Xiao, S.;Nayak, B.;Samuel, A.;Paldurai, A.;Kanabagattebasavarajappa, M.;Prajitno, T.

Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an insect-borne virus that causes huge economic losses in the livestock industry worldwide. Aedes albopictus cell lines have become powerful and convenient tools to study BTV-vector interactions. However, the role of miRNAs in A. albopictus cells during BTV infection is not well understood. In this study, we performed deep sequencing analysis of small RNA libraries from BTV-infected and mock-infected A. albopictus cells, and a total of 11,206,854 and 12,125,274 clean reads, respectively, were identified. A differential expression analysis showed that 140 miRNAs, including 15 known and 125 new miRNAs, were significantly deregulated after infection, and a total of 414 and 2307 target genes were annotated, respectively. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction validated the expression patterns of 11 selected miRNAs and their mRNA targets. Functional annotation of target genes suggested that these target genes were mainly involved in metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, endocytosis, RNA transport, as well as FoxO, Hippo, Jak-STAT and MAPK signaling pathways. This is the first systematic study on the effect of BTV infection on miRNA expression in A. albopictus cells. This research provides insights into the cellular miRNA expression profile in response to BTV infection and offers clues to identify potential candidates for vector-based antiviral strategies.",,"Xing, S.;Du, J.;Gao, S.;Tian, Z.;Zheng, Y.;Liu, G.;Luo, J.;Yin, H.",2016.0,Apr,,0

To date, seven PPV genotypes (PPV1 to PPV7) have been identified. PPV7, the most recently discovered PPV genotype, was first reported in American pigs in 2016. To explore the status of PPV7 in Chinese pig populations, a total of 64 serum samples collected from two commercial farms in the province were tested. from Guangdong in 2014. PPV7 DNA was detected in 32.8% (21/64) of the samples tested. In the porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) positive farm, the prevalence rate of PPV7 was 65.5% (19/29), which was significantly higher than that in the PCV2 negative farm (2/35, 5, 7%), indicating a possible association between PCV2 and PPV7 infections. The sequences of three PPV7 strains were determined. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that identified PPV7 strains circulating in China shared 98.7% to 99.7% nucleotide homology with the US strain. Further sequence comparison analysis indicated that GD-2014-2 and GD-2014-3 possess a consecutive 9 nt deletion in the VP gene.

In this study, PERV was investigated among the Ningxiang pig conservation population. The result revealed that the PERV distribution genotype was subtype A, 100%; subtype B, 100%; and subtype C, 100%. The env sequences of PERV-A and -B showed 11 clones detected by digestion with KpnI and MboI, indicating that multiple variants of PERV-A and -B existed in the Ningxiang pig. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results showed that PERV had transcriptional activity in these individuals. In addition, recombinant PERV A/C was detected in most of the Ningxiang pigs. Because PERV A/C recombinants increase the potential infectious risk, the breed may not be a suitable donor for xenotransplantation. Crown Copyright © 2009.",,"Xing, X. W.;Hawthorne, W.

2315,Detection and phylogenetic analysis of porcine bocaviruses carried by murine rodents and domestic shrews in China,"Bocaparvovirus infections in humans and wild and domestic animals have been widely reported throughout the world. In this study, we detected and genetically characterized porcine bocavirus (PBoV) transmitted by murine rodents (Rattus norvegicus, Rattus tanezumi, and Rattus losea) and domestic shrews (Suncus murinus) in China. Between May 2015 and May 2017, 496 mouse rodents and 23 domestic shrews were captured in four Chinese provinces. Nested polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate the prevalence of PBoV in throat swab, stool, and serum samples. A total of 7.5% (39/519) of throat swab samples, 60.5% (309/511) of fecal samples, and 22.9% (52/227) of serum samples were positive for PBoV. The prevalence between R. norvegicus and R. tanezumi was higher than between R. losea and domestic shrews. Positive samples for PBoV were found in all four provinces. Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial viral capsid protein 1/2 (VP1/VP2) showed that the sequences obtained in this study formed a new group (PBoV G4). In addition, five nearly complete PBoV genomes (4715-4798 nt) were acquired. These genomes encoded two nonstructural proteins, NS1 (1908 nt in four genomes and 1923 nt in the remaining genome) and NP1 (600 nt), and the structural proteins, VP1/VP2 (1851 nt). Phylogenetic analysis showed that PBoV G4 is distinct from rodent, human, and other bocaviruses. In conclusion, the prevalence of PBoV G4 was high among two common murine rodents in China, and the pathogenicity of PBoV G4 needs to be further clarified.",,"Xiong, Y. Q.;You, F. F.;Chen, X.

2316,Metagenomic analysis of the fecal microbiome of Rhinopithecus bieti reveals a wide diversity of bacterial and glycoside hydrolase profiles related to lignocellulose degradation,"BACKGROUND: The animal gastrointestinal tract contains a complex community of microbes, the composition of which ultimately reflects the co-evolution of the microorganisms with their animal host and the diet adopted by the host. Although the importance of the gut microbiota of humans has been well demonstrated, there is a paucity of research on non-human primates (NHPs), especially herbivorous NHPs. RESULTS: In this study, an analysis of 97,942 pyrosequencing reads generated from Rhinopithecus bieti fecal DNA extracts was performed to help better understand the microbial diversity and functional capacity of the R. bieti gut microbiome. Taxonomic analysis of metagenomic reads indicated that the fecal microbiomes of R. bieti were dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria phyla. Comparative taxonomic classification analysis revealed that the R. bieti metagenome was characterized by an overrepresentation of bacteria from the phylum Fibrobacteres and Spirochaetes compared to other animals. The primary functional categories were mainly associated with proteins, carbohydrates, amino acids, DNA and RNA metabolism, cofactors, cell wall, and capsule and membrane transport. Comparison of the glycoside hydrolase profiles of R. bieti with those of other animals revealed that the R. bieti microbiome was more closely related to the rumen of the cow. CONCLUSIONS: The metagenomic and functional analysis showed that R. bieti possesses a wide diversity of bacteria and numerous glycoside hydrolases responsible for the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass, which could reflect the adaptations associated with a diet rich in fibrous matter. These results would contribute to the limited body of NHP metagenome studies and provide a unique genetic resource of microbial plant cell wall-degrading enzymes. However, future studies on R. bieti metagenome sequencing are required regarding the effects of age, genetics, diet, and environment on metagenome composition and activity.",,"Xu, B.;Xu, W.;Li, J.;Dai, L.;Xiong, C.;Tang, X.;Yang, Y.;Mu, Y.;Zhou, J.;Ding, J.;Wu, Q.;Huang, Z.",2015.0,,10.1186/s12864-015-1378-7,0

We collected 92 serum samples from non-AD hepatitis patients in Chongqing, China, between 1999 and 2007. Ten pools of sera were examined by Solexa deep sequencing. We discovered a 3780 bp contig present in all 10 groups that yielded BLASTx E scores of 7e-05-0.008 against parvovirus. The complete sequence of the 3780 bp contig assembled in silico was confirmed by gene amplification of overlapping regions in almost the entire genome, and the virus was provisionally designated NIH-CQV. Further analysis revealed that the contig was composed of two major ORFs. According to protein BLAST, ORF1 and ORF2 were most homologous to bat circovirus replication-associated protein and porcine parvovirus capsid protein, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that NIH-CQV lies at the interface of Parvoviridae and Circoviridae. The prevalence of NIH-CQV in patients was determined by quantitative PCR. Sixty-three of 90 patient samples (70%) were positive, but all of 45 healthy controls were negative. The mean virus titer in patient samples was 1.05 e4 copies/microL. Specific antibodies against NIH-CQV were searched for by immunoblotting. Eighty-four percent of patients were positive for IgG and 31% were positive for IgM; in contrast, 78% of healthy controls were positive for IgG, but all were negative for IgM.

An important regulatory protein of HEV, ORF3, influences multiple signaling pathways in host cells. In this study, to investigate the role of ORF3 of the porcine form of HEV (SHEV), a high-throughput RNA-Seq-based screen was performed to identify genes differentially expressed in ORF3-expressing HepG2 cells. The results were validated with quantitative real-time PCR and gene ontology was used to assign differentially expressed genes to functional categories. The results indicated that, in established ORF3-expressing HepG2 cells, the mRNA levels of CLDN6, YLPM1, APOC3, NLRP1, SCARA3, FGA, FGG, FGB, and FREM1 were increased, while the mRNA levels of SLC2A3, DKK1, BPIFB2 , and PTGR1 were downregulated. Dysregulated expression of CLDN6 and FREM1 could contribute to changes in integral membrane and basement membrane protein expression, changes in NLRP1 expression could affect HepG2 cell apoptosis, and altered expression of APOC3, SCARA3, and APOC3. DKK1 could affect lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, ORF3 plays a functional role in virus-cell interactions by affecting the expression of integral membrane protein and basement membrane proteins and by altering the process of apoptosis and lipid metabolism in host cells.

The VP2 gene sequences of nine newly isolated IBDVs, obtained from by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. with worldwide reference isolates, which have been previously well characterized. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all nine IBDV isolates from broilers are closely related to highly virulent IBDV strains (vvIBDV). Analysis of the predicted VP2 amino acid sequences of the nine vvIBDV isolates from broilers revealed that they share 99.2 to 100% sequence similarity. In addition, all nine isolates also encode VP2 amino acids A222, I242, I256, I294, and S299 that are conserved among previously characterized vvIBDV strains.

Control measures included movement restrictions that were placed in a total of 404 individual premises, 150 of which were located within a 3 km radius of an infected premises (IP). A full epidemiological investigation revealed that the source of this HPAI H5N2 virus for 4 of the commercial PIs and the one non-commercial PI likely involved indirect contact with wild birds. Three PIs were associated with bird movement or service providers and localized/environmental spread was suspected to be the source of infection for the remaining 4 PIs. Viral phylogenies, determined by Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods, were used to validate the epidemiologically inferred transmission network.

Two H9N2 viruses were isolated from a mink farm in 2014. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the internal genes of H9N2 viruses are closely related to those of H7N9 viruses. Interestingly, two H9N2s were separated in phylogenetic trees, indicating that they were introduced to this mink farm in two separate events. And other studies in mice showed that one H9N2 caused overt weight loss and 20% mortality in infected mice, while another virus caused no clinical signs in mice infected at the same dose. Genetic analysis indicated that virulent H9N2 contains a natural mutation at 701N in the PB2 protein, which has been reported to contribute to mammalian adaptation. However, such a substitution is absent in mouse-avirulent H9N2.

The present study was an attempt to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship of H9N2 AIVs in two geographically distinct regions of China where vaccination is routinely practiced. A total of 18 emerging H9N2 isolates were identified and genetically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes confirmed that the isolates belonged to the Y280 lineage. Based on the HA genes, the isolates were subdivided into two subgroups. Viruses from Zhejiang province were grouped in Group I, while isolates from Guangdong province were grouped in Group II. Antigenic characterization showed that the viruses tested were antigenically different compared to the currently used vaccine strain. It was notable that 14 out of 18 isolates had an amino acid swap (Q?L) at position 216 (226 by H3 numbering) in the receptor binding site, indicating that the virus had potential binding affinity. to the human-like receptor. .

Twenty-six of the 31 isolates were classified as BVDV1 and the rest as BVDV2. Phylogenetic analysis of the amplified RT-PCR fragments of the isolates showed the presence of viruses belonging to the genotypes BVDV1a, BVDV1b, BVDV1c, unclassified BVDV1, and BVDV2. From cattle of Australian origin, 16 of 17 isolates were classified as BVDV1c. This result was in agreement with a report showing that BVDV1c was a predominant subgenotype in Australia. From cattle of North American origin, the species BVDV1 and BVDV2 were found. BVDV2 from North American cattle was identified as the same group as the BVDV 890 strain, which is the prototype of BVDV2. These results suggest that the BVDVs isolated from cattle exported in the AQS reflect the predominant BVDV genotypes found in the exporting countries. The unclassified BVDV1 genotype of Chinese origin was in the same group as the ZM-95 strain, which was isolated from pigs in China. In this study, the genomic properties of 31 BVDV isolates collected at the AQS were investigated. We conclude that the isolates are genetically heterogeneous but geographically restricted.

However, the characteristics of domestic hepatitis E infections in Japan are not fully understood. We analyzed serum samples from 34 patients who were treated at a hospital in the city of Sendai, Japan, between January 1997 and December 2002, and who had been diagnosed with non-A, non-B, non-C acute sporadic hepatitis. . Among these 34 patients, 3 (9%; all men; ages 54, 59, and 61) were positive for anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies and for HEV RNA. The HEV isolates (HE-JAS1 and HE-JAS3) obtained from case 1 and case 3, respectively, segregated into genotype III; they had the highest nucleotide sequence identity, 99.5% and 99.0%, with HE-JA7 and HE-JA8, respectively, which had been isolated in Iwate, a neighboring prefecture of Sendai. In contrast, the remaining HEV isolate (HE-JAS2), obtained from case 2, segregated into genotype IV; had the highest nucleotide sequence identity, 99.8% and 99.3%, with JKK-Sap and HE-JA3, respectively, both of which were isolated in Hokkaido, Japan, although case 2 had never been to Hokkaido. Our three patients with hepatitis E had not traveled abroad in the previous year, had not had contact with pigs, and had no history of blood transfusions.

Immunized sentinel chickens with high levels of neutralizing antibodies and non-immunized sentinel chickens were raised together with broilers on a commercial farm. Severe atrophy of the bursa of Fabricius was observed from the second week after cohabitation in non-immunized sentinel chickens. However, in immunized sentinel and broiler chickens, atrophy was observed from the third week after cohabitation. IBD virus (IBDV) isolated from the bursa of Fabricius of immunized sentinel chickens, designated strain IBDV TY2, showed severe bursal atrophy in infected SPF chickens. Antiserum against IBDV strain TY2 showed greater neutralizing activity against heterologous IBDV strains than antiserum against K strain vaccinia virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the nucleotide sequences encoding the hypervariable region of IBDV protein 2 IBDV strain TY2 viruses did not cluster with classical, variant, or highly virulent IBDV clusters. Based on these results, we suggest that IBDV strain TY2 may constitute a new IBDV-like variant.",,"Yamazaki, K.;Ohta, H.;Kawai, T.;Yamaguchi, T.;Obi, T.;Takase, K.",2017.0,,10.1292/jvms.16-0301,0

2332,Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene of infectious bronchitis virus isolates from China,"Between 2006 and 2009, seven strains of infectious bronchitis (IB) virus (IBV) were isolated from vaccinated chicken flocks in different poultry farms in China. The pathogenic characters of seven IBV strains were evaluated. Each of the seven strains was infectious to the test chickens and could induce an immune response. Results of chicken embryo cross-neutralization assays showed that these strains were antigenically distinct from the classical IBV strains of H120, M41, Conn and Gray. Compared with the H120 vaccine strain, the point mutation, short insertion, and deletion occurred at many positions in the S1 protein of all seven strains. Five of the seven strains had the (HRRRR) motif, which was identical to that of the IBV epidemic strains in China. Two new motifs (HRLRR and RRIRR) emerged in the isolates. The homology of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the S1 gene among the seven isolates was 81.7%-99.7% and 79.0%-99.4%, respectively. These seven strains were also genetically different from the vaccine strains and non-Chinese IBV strains, but were closely related to a large number of Chinese strains. The seven isolates and the 36 reference IBV strains were grouped into six different groups (IVI). The seven strains were classified into groups I, II, and III, forming a large phylogenetic branch, which is closely related to Chinese IBVs, while the vaccine strains belonging to group VI are genetically distant from groups I, II, and III.

2333,Failure to detect bovine viral diarrhea virus 2 (BVDV-2a) subgenotype a by direct fluorescent antibody testing in tissue samples due to reduced reactivity of field isolates to crude anti-BVDV antibody,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1) is associated with mild or subclinical infections, whereas BVDV-2 is frequently implicated in outbreaks of severe thrombocytopenia and acute fatal illness. In the present study, the carcass of a beef breed cow and tissue samples from a beef calf were received for laboratory diagnosis. Both animals presented severe clinical signs consistent with thrombocytopenia or hemorrhagic syndrome. Direct fluorescent antibody test (DFAT) did not detect BVDV antigen in tissue samples from both cases. However, immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed the presence of BVDV antigen in the oral and esophageal mucosa and Peyer's patches of the bovine breed. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) detected BVDV-2 in selected tissues from both animals. Subsequently, BVDV was isolated from both cases and subjected to genetic and serological characterization. Mutations in the primer and probe binding sites of the genomic 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) and the E2 gene were associated with reduced efficiency of an established real-time RT-PCR assay and alterations. of amino acids in glycoprotein E2, respectively. Both viral isolates were classified by real-time RT-PCR and phylogenetic analysis as subgenotype a of BVDV-2. Unlike the BVDV Singer and 125c reference strains, the isolates cross-reacted with the anti-BVDV-1 and anti-BVDV-2 reference sera, indicating antigenic variations in the field isolates. The isolates also showed reduced reactivity to porcine anti-BVDV antiserum (the crude serum used to produce the BVDV DFA conjugate). In summary, the data from the present investigation indicated that genetic and antigenic variations affected the performance of screening assays, especially DFAT, highlighting the need for regular evaluation and modification of BVDV tests.",,"Yan, L.;Pace, L.

2334,Genome-wide identification of copy number variations between two chicken lines that differ in genetic resistance to Marek's disease,"BACKGROUND: Copy number variation (CNV) is an important source of genome polymorphism that directly contributes to phenotypic variation, such as resistance to infectious diseases. Lines 63 and 72 are two highly inbred experimental chicken lines that differ greatly in susceptibility to Marek's disease (MD), and have been used extensively in efforts to identify the genetic and molecular basis of genetic resistance to MD. . Using next-generation sequencing, we present a genome-wide assessment of CNVs that are potentially associated with genetic resistance to MD. METHODS: Three randomly selected chickens from each line were sequenced at an average depth of 20x. Two popular software, CNVnator and Pindel, were used to call genomic CNVs separately. The results were combined to obtain a binding set of genomic CNVs in the two chicken lines. RESULTS: A total of 5680 CNV regions (CNVRs) were identified after merging the two data sets, of which 1546 and 1866 were specific to the MD resistant or susceptible line, respectively. More than half of the line-specific CNVRs were shared by 2 or more chickens, reflecting the reduced diversity in both inbred lines. Fixed CNVRs in the susceptible lines were significantly enriched for genes involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. We also found 67 CNVRs overlapping with 62 genes previously shown to be strong candidates for the underlying genes responsible for MD susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of the two chicken lines and further evidence that the MAPK signaling pathway may play an important role in the host response to MD virus infection. The rich source of line-specific CNVs is valuable for future disease-related association studies in the two chicken lines.",,"Yan, Y.;Yang, N.;Cheng, H.

The identity of the M segment among these viruses is remarkably low, although previous researchers reported that the small RNA segments are highly conserved. Because the M segment encodes the viral surface glycoproteins G1 and G2, the variability of the M segment can affect the antigenicity of these viruses.

The hemagglutinin (HA) gene of Dk/Hb/216 /85/H7N8 had multiple amino acid sequences (-PEIPKGRG-) in the linker peptide between HA1 and HA2, which is considered a hallmark molecular feature of low pathogenicity. Key host marker sites between genes (M, NP, NS, PA and PB2) of Dk/Hb/216/85/H7N8 were similar to those of H5N1 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that genes (M, NS, and PB2) from Dk/Hb/216/85/H7N8 closely clustered with those from Gs/Guangdong/1996/H5N1 (Gs/GD/96), implying that three ancient Gs genes /GD/96-like viruses had been circulating in central China during the 1980s.

2348,High Throughput Nucleotide Sequence Analysis of Diverse Bacterial Communities in Leachate from Decomposing Pig Carcasses,"Leachate generated from the decomposition of animal carcasses has been implicated as an environmental contaminant surrounding the burial site. High-throughput nucleotide sequencing was carried out to investigate bacterial communities in leachate from pig carcass spoilage. We acquired 51,230 reads from six different samples (1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 14 week channels) and found that sequences representing the Firmicutes phylum predominated. The sequence diversity of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in the leachate was higher at 6 weeks, in contrast to those at 2 and 14 weeks. The relative abundance of Firmicutes decreased, while the proportion of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria increased from 3 to 6 weeks. Phyla representation was restored after 14 weeks. However, the community structures between the samples taken at 1-2 and 14 weeks differed in the level of bacterial classification. The pH trend was similar to the changes observed in the bacterial communities, indicating that the pH of the leachate could be related to the change in the microbial community. The results indicate that the composition of bacterial communities in leachate from decomposing pig carcasses changed continuously during the study period and could be influenced by burial site.",,"Yang, S.

2349,Next-generation sequencing enables the discovery of more diverse positive clones from a library of antibodies displayed on phage,"Phage display technology provides a powerful tool to screen a library for a binding molecule through an enrichment process. It has been adopted as a critical technology in the development of therapeutic antibodies. However, a major drawback of phage display technology is that because the degree of enrichment cannot be controlled during the bioselection process, it often results in a limited number of clones. In this study, we apply next-generation sequencing (NGS) to select clones from a library and determine if a greater number of clones can be identified using NGS than using conventional methods. Three chicken immune single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries were bioscreened for prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Phagemid DNA prepared from the original libraries as well as from the Escherichia coli pool after each round of bioscreening was analyzed by NGS, and the heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences of the scFv clones. Subsequently, through two-step linker PCR and cloning, the entire scFv gene was recovered and tested for PSA reactivity in a phage enzyme immunoassay. After four rounds of bioselection, the conventional colony selection method was performed for comparison. The scFv clones recovered from NGS analysis included all clones identified by the conventional colony selection method, as well as many additional clones. The enrichment of the HCDR3 sequence throughout the bioselection process was a positive predictive factor for the selection of PSA-reactive scFv clones.",,"Yang, W.;Yoon, A.;Lee, S.;Kim, S.;Han, J.;Chung, J.",2017.0,03 24,,0

2352,MicroRNA transcriptome analysis in chicken kidneys in response to different virulent infectious bronchitis virus infections,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) can cause a highly contagious acute respiratory disease in poultry. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of crucial regulators for gene expression and are involved in the regulation of virus defense and immunological processes. To understand miRNA regulation in chickens in response to IBV infection, high-throughput sequencing was performed to compare small RNA libraries from kidneys of chickens infected with SCK2, SCDY2, and LDT3-A. By comparing these data to healthy chickens, a total of 58 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified. DE miRNAs were further classified into five miRNA expression patterns (up- or down-regulation compared to control). Using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment prediction, DE miRNAs were shown to be primarily associated with metabolic processes, catalytic activities, gene expression, binding activities, and immune responses. Seven highly expressed miRNAs (gga-miR-30d, gga-miR-1454, gga-miR-7b, gga-miR-215-5p, gga-miR-1a-3p, gga-miR-3538, and gga-miR-2954 ) were selected for joint miRNA-mRNA analysis. Furthermore, the miRNAs were inversely correlated with the corresponding target gene mRNAs. These seven miRNAs were considered to play an important role in IBV-host interactions and different virulences of IBV strains. This is the first demonstration that infection with different virulent IBVs elicits different miRNA expression in chicken kidneys; this expression also appears to be associated with IBV virulence. These results are significant for the study of miRNA-mediated immune responses to infection with different virulent IBVs, as well as for the interaction between the chicken host and IBV.",,"Yang, X.;Gao, W.;Liu, H.;Li, J.;Chen, D.;Yuan, F.;Zhang, Z.;Wang, H.",2017.0,,10.1007/s00705-017-3502-2,0

This virus represents a significant potential threat to humans and poultry due to its global spread and infectivity. We used three overlapping polymerase chain reactions (PCR) to map the entire genome of AGV2. We then modeled the evolutionary history of this new sequence data in the context of related GenBank sequences. We analyzed the characteristics of viral proteins from different phylogenetic groups and explored differences in evolutionary trends between Chinese strains and strains from other countries. We obtained 17 complete AGV2 genomes of avian origin from different regions of China between 2015 and 2016. Phylogenetic analyzes of these Chinese AGV2 sequences and related sequences yielded four distinct groups (AD) with significant bootstrap values. We also constructed phylogenies using predicted viral protein sequences. We found a potential hypervariable region in VP1 at sites 288-314 and identified the amino acid changes responsible for the distinct VP2 and VP3 clusters.

2354,Isolation of a new serotype strain of infectious bronchitis virus ZZ2004 from ducks in China,"In chickens, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) often causes respiratory distress, decreased egg production, poor egg quality, and occasional nephritis. However, ZZ2004, a Chinese isolate of IBV, was obtained from ducks with clinical growth suppression and mild respiratory symptoms that had been reared with chickens in central China. Virus isolation, virus neutralization tests, and RT-PCR were used to identify the causative pathogen, while sequence alignment was used to analyze genetic variations of the S1 subunit and M genes. The results showed that the ducks were infected with IBV due to the appearance of a dwarfing phenotype and the death of the embryos between 48 and 144 hours after inoculation. RT-PCR also confirmed the presence of the expected fragment sizes of the S1 subunit and M genes by RT-PCR. Meanwhile, virus neutralization test results indicated that strains of JX/99/01, GD, SAIBK, LDT3 showed cross-reactivity with isolate ZZ2004, and cross-neutralization of IBV ZZ2004 with strains of M41 was hardly observed. . , H120, grey, Holte or Aust-T. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that there were large differences between ZZ2004 and other IBV reference strains in the S1 subunit.

The genetic basis of its pathogenesis remains a mystery and effective prevention measures have not been established. To better understand S. suis virulence differentiation and develop a promising vaccine, we isolated and sequenced a native avirulent strain of S. suis (05HAS68). Animal experiments revealed that 05HAS68 is an avirulent strain and could protect piglets from attack by virulent strains. Comparative genomics analyzes demonstrated the genetic basis for the lack of virulence in 05HAS68, which is characterized by the absence of some important virulence-associated factors and the intact 89K island of pathogenicity. The lack of virulence was also illustrated by reduced survival of 05HAS68 compared to a virulent strain in pig whole blood. Further investigation revealed a large-scale genomic rearrangement in 05HAS68, which was proposed to be mediated by transposase and/or prophage genes. This genomic rearrangement may have caused the genomic diversity of S. suis and led to biological discrepancies between 05HAS68 and highly virulent S. suis strains.",,"Yao, X.;Li, M.;Wang, J.;Wang, C.;Hu, D.;Zheng, F.;Pan, X.;Tan, Y.;Zhao, Y.;Hu, L.;Tang, J.;Hu, F.",2015.0,,10.1038/srep09835,0

2357,SARS-CoV Relationship to Other Pathogenic RNA Viruses Explored Using Tetranucleotide Usage Profiling,"BACKGROUND: The exact origin of the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) remains an open question. The relationship of the SARS-CoV genomic sequence to 30 different single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses from various families was studied using two non-standard approaches. Both approaches started with vector profiling of the V tetranucleotide usage pattern for each virus. In approach one, a distance measure of a vector V, based on the correlation coefficient, was devised to build a relationship tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. In approach two, multivariate factor analysis was performed to derive patterns of embedded tetranucleotide usage. These patterns were later used to classify the selected viruses. RESULTS: Both approaches yielded relationship results that are consistent with known virus classification. They also indicated that the genome of RNA viruses in the same family conforms to a specific pattern of word usage. Based on the correlation of general patterns of tetranucleotide use, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGV) and feline coronavirus (FCoV) are closest to SARS-CoV. Also surprisingly, RNA viruses that do not go through a DNA step showed remarkable discrimination against CpG and UpA dinucleotide (z = -77.31, -52.48 respectively) and selection for UpG and CpA (z = 65.79,49.99 respectively). Potential factors influencing these biases are discussed. CONCLUSION: The study of the use of genomic words is a powerful method for classifying RNA viruses. Congruence of the relationship results with known classification indicates that there are phylogenetic cues in tetranucleotide usage patterns, which are most prominent in replicase open reading frames.",,"Yap, Y.

2358,Frequency of hemagglutinin mutants D222G and Q223R of pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus in Japan between 2009 and 2010,"Background: In April 2009, a new pig-derived influenza A virus (H1N1pdm) emerged and spread rapidly throughout the world, including Japan. It has been suggested that the virus may bind to 2,3- and 2,6-linked sialic acid receptors in infected mammals, in contrast to contemporary seasonal H1N1 viruses, which have a predilection for 2,6-linked sialic acid. Methods/Results: To elucidate the existence and transmissibility of α2,3-sialic acid-specific viruses in H1N1pdm, amino acid substitutions within viral hemagglutinin molecules, especially D187E, D222G, and Q223R, which are related to a change of avian receptor specificity. Samples from people infected during the first and second waves of the outbreak in Japan were examined using a high-throughput sequencing method. In May 2009, three samples from mild cases showed D222G and/or Q223R substitutions in a minor subpopulation of virus infecting these individuals. However, the substitutions almost disappeared in the samples from five mild cases in December 2010. The D187E substitution was not widespread in the samples, even in May 2009. Conclusions: These results suggest that α2-sialic acid-specific viruses ,3, including G222 and R223, existed in humans as a minor population in the early phase of the pandemic, and that D222 and Q223 became more dominant through human-to-human transmission during the first and second waves of the pandemic. epidemic.

H9N2 viruses containing such internal genes exist widely in poultry but are rarely reported in migratory birds. In this study, two H9N2 virus strains were isolated from fecal samples of migratory birds in 2014: one strain from Caizi Lake in Anhui Province and one from Chen Lake in Hubei Province of China. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed high homology of the six internal genes of these two strains with the internal genes of the human H10N8 virus in Jiangxi province, as well as with the human H7N9 virus. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a possible origin of these two poultry strains in southern China. The two viruses tested could replicate in the respiratory organs of infectious mice without adaptation, by both strains of AIV H9N2 from wild birds, suggesting their potential ability to directly infect mammals. Our findings indicate the existence of H9N2 viruses that contain internal genes that are highly homologous with human H10N8 or H7N9 viruses. Wild birds may contribute to the spread of the H9N2 virus that contains the ""harmful"" internal genetic complex, leading to genetic reassortment with other influenza viruses and the generation of new pathogenic viruses.

The objective of this study was to detect the presence of novel signatures that may serve as early warning indicators of the conversion of LPAI viruses to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. This study included three H5N2 and one H5N3 virus that were isolated from live poultry imported into Singapore as part of the national avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance program.

Detailed analyzes of the phylogenetic tree using the HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes grouped these isolates into the Eurasian H5 lineage, but away from the HPAI H5 subtypes. This analysis further revealed that the internal genes clustered into different avian and porcine subtypes, suggesting that all four isolates possibly share ancestry with these different influenza subtypes.

HCV is the type species of the genus Hepacivirus (Flaviviridae) to which newly discovered animal viruses, ie, from horses, bats, rodents, and cattle, are assigned. After preliminary reports in 2015 from German and African cattle, a wide distribution of bovine hepaciviruses (BovHepV, Hepacivirus N) was proposed. We investigated the possible presence of BovHepV in serum samples from cattle in different locations in Turkey. Analysis of a total of 120 samples from 98 females (milk) and 22 males (beef) by real-time RT-PCR resulted in 15 (12.5%) positives. BovHepV infection was detected in 6 of the 10 sites included in the study. There were positive samples from both the east and west of the country, indicating a possible wide distribution in the Turkish cattle population. Phylogenetic analysis of 9 selected positive samples clearly assigned 8 sequences to a separate group on the basis of the NS3 gene region, while one of the sequences obtained from an animal imported from northern Italy was grouped with sequences obtained from cattle in Germany. .

2365,Detection and genetic characterization of feline bocavirus in Northeast China,"Background: Bocaviruses have been reported to cause respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis in most animal species. In cats, different bocavirus genotypes have been identified in the US, Japan, Hong Kong, and Portugal. However, the clear relationship between clinical symptoms and FBoV infection is unknown, and the prevalence of FBoV and the distribution of FBoV genotypes in China are still unclear. Results: In this study, 197 fecal samples were collected from cats with diarrhea (n = 105) and normal cats (n = 92) in different regions between January 2016 and November 2017 and investigated by PCR targeting different FBoV genotypes. . Screening results showed that 51 of 197 samples (25.9%) were positive for FBoV and a higher positive rate was observed in cats with diarrhea (33.3%, 35/105) than in normal cats (17.4 %, 16/92). Of these FBoV-positive samples, 35 were identified as FBoV-1, 12 as FBoV-2, and 4 as FBoV-1 and FBoV-2 coinfection. A partial NS1 gene-based phylogenetic analysis indicated that 24 sequences from randomly selected FBoV-positive samples fell into 2 different FBoV groups: FBoV-1 and FBoV-2. In addition, 6 strains were randomly selected and the entire genome was sequenced and analyzed. These strains exhibited the typical bocavirus genomic organization and were closely related to FBoV. Two identified FBoV-2 strains shared high homologies with the FBoV-2 reference strains based on the entire genome and the entire coding gene, but lower identities in the NP1 and VP1 regions were exhibited for the other 4 identified strains. FBoV-1 compared to FBoV-1 reference strains. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that genetically diverse FBoV-1 and FBoV-2 circulate widely in cats in northeast China and that FBoV-1 is more prevalent. The high prevalence of FBoV in cats with symptoms of diarrhea suggests that FBoV infection may be associated with diarrhea in cats.",,"Yi, S. S.;Niu, J. T.;Wang, H. L.;Dong, G. Y.;Zhao, Y.

2366,Novel highly divergent sapoviruses detected by metagenomic analysis in straw-colored fruit bats in Cameroon,"Sapoviruses (SaVs) belong to the genus Sapovirus, in the family Caliciviridae. They have been associated with gastroenteritis in humans and pigs, but not in other animals. Furthermore, some strains from pigs, chimpanzees, and rodents show close sequence identity with human SaVs, suggesting the possibility of interspecies transmissions. Bats are known to be an important reservoir for zoonotic viruses, yet very little is known about the genetic diversity of SaVs in bats. To explore the genetic diversity of bat SaVs, faecal samples of Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus were treated according to the NetoVIR protocol and sequenced with Illumina technology. Nearly complete genome sequences of six highly divergent SaVs and one partial SaV (VP1 region only) were identified in Eidolon helvum and, based on sequence identities and phylogenetic analysis, potentially represent two novel genogroups, only distantly related to known SaVs. Furthermore, comparison of these sequences with currently used detection primers and probes indicated that the novel SaVs would not be detected in routine human epidemiological detection studies in the event of interspecies transmission. Therefore, we designed and validated new primers that can detect both human and bat SaV. In this study, we identified multiple SaVs from novel bats; however, further human epidemiological studies are needed to unravel its potential role in gastroenteritis.",,"Yinda, C.

2367,"Cameroonian fruit bats harbor divergent viruses including rotavirus H, bastroviruses and picobirnaviruses that use an alternative genetic code","Most emerging infectious diseases in humans originate in wildlife, and bats are an important reservoir of viruses, some of which have been highly pathogenic for humans. In some regions of Cameroon, bats are hunted and eaten as a delicacy. This close proximity between humans and bats provides ample opportunity for zoonotic events. To elucidate the viral diversity of fruit bats in Cameroon, we collected and metagenomically analyzed eighty-seven faecal samples from fruit bats Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus. The results showed a plethora of known and new viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes of the eleven gene segments of the first complete bat rotavirus H genome showed clearly separate clusters of human, porcine, and bat rotavirus H strains, indicating no recent events of interspecies transmission. In addition, we identified and analyzed a genome of bat bastroviruses (a recently described novel group of viruses, related to astroviruses and hepatitis E viruses), confirming their recombinant nature and providing further evidence for additional recombination events between bat bastroviruses. bat. Interestingly, picobirnavirus-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene segments were identified using an alternative mitochondrial genetic code, and additional principal component analyzes suggested that they may have a mitovirus-like lifestyle, a group of mitochondrial-like elements. viruses known to infect fungal mitochondria Although the identified strains of bat coronaviruses, parvoviruses, and cycloviruses belong to established genera, most of the identified partitiviruses and densoviruses constitute putative new genera in their respective families.

2368,Phylogenetic evidence for intertypic recombination in the emergence of human enterovirus 71 subgenotypes,"Background: Human enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is a common causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). In recent years, the virus has caused several outbreaks with a high number of deaths and serious neurological complications. Several new EV-71 subgenotypes were identified from these outbreaks. The mechanisms that contributed to the appearance of these subgenotypes are unknown. Results: Six EV-71 isolates from an outbreak in Malaysia in 1997 were completely sequenced. These isolates were identified as subgenotypes EV-71, B3, B4 and C2. A phylogenetic tree that correlated well with the current enterovirus classification scheme was established using these full genome sequences and all other available full genome sequences of EV-71 and human enterovirus A (HEV-A). However, using the 5â€² UTR, P2, and P3 genomic regions, isolates of EV-71 subgenotypes B3 and C4 were separated from other EV-71 subgenotypes in a group together with coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16/ G10) and EV-71. C2 subgenotype clustered with CV-A8. The results of the similarity plot analyzes supported the grouping of these isolates with other HEV-A. In contrast, in the same genomic regions, an isolate of CV-A16, Tainan5079, clustered with EV-71. This suggests that between EV-71 and CV-A16, only structural genes were conserved. The 3â€² end of the virus genome varied and consisted of sequences very similar to several HEV-A viruses. Numerous recombination crossover breakpoints were identified within the nonstructural genes of some of these newer EV-71 subgenotypes. Conclusion: Phylogenetic evidence obtained from whole genome sequence analyzes supports the possible occurrence of intertypic recombination involving EV-71 and several HEV-As, including CV-A16, the most common causative agent of HFMD. It is suggested that these recombination events played an important role in the appearance of the various EV-71 subgenotypes. © 2006 Yoke-Fun and AbuBakar; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Yoke-Fun, C.;AbuBakar, S.",2006.0,,10.1186/1471-2180-6-74,0
2369,Tracing the genetic history of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses derived from full ORF 5-7 sequences: a Bayesian coalescent approach,"To trace the genetic history of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), we determined the complete sequences of ORFs 5 to 7 of four PRRSV isolates. These sequences were analyzed together with published sequences from 146 isolates from various parts of the world using a Bayesian coalescent approach, as well as Bayesian and maximum likelihood inference methods. All European-type (EU-type) viruses were classified in one of two groups or were not classified (4 isolates), while all North American-type (NA-type) viruses were classified in one of the three main groups or were not classified (5 isolates). Within each genotype, no apparent periodic and/or geographic influence on PRRSV evolution was observed. The evolutionary rate of PRRSV isolates was estimated at 1.55 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year, and the time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) was 491.2 years ago. Here, the TMRCA for EU and NA type viruses was 58.7 and 62.6 years ago, respectively. A Bayesian plot of the horizon revealed that viruses evolved with nearly constant population size until the late 1970s, when they underwent population expansion that continued until the late 1980s. Population size then remained constant. again until the early 2000s, when there was a rapid and steep decline in the actual number of infections. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Yoon, S.

2370,Phylogenomics and molecular evolution of foot-and-mouth disease virus,"This report describes the use of Bayesian methods to analyze polyprotein coding region sequences (n = 217) obtained from GenBank to define the genome-wide phylogeny of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). The results strongly supported the monophyly of five FMD virus serotypes, O, A, Asia 1, C and SAT 3, while the sequences of the remaining two FMD virus serotypes, SAT 1 and SAT 2, they did not separate into completely distinct clades. The phylogenomic tree revealed three sister group relationships, serotype O + Asia 1, A + C, and SAT 1 + 3 + 2, with a new branching pattern: {[(O, Asia 1), (A, C)], (SAT 1, 2, 3)}. Within each serotype, there was no apparent periodic, geographic, or host species influence on the evolution of global FMD viruses. Analysis of the polyprotein coding region of these sequences provided evidence for the influence of purifying selection on FMDV evolution. Using a Bayesian coalescent approach, the evolutionary rate of FMD virus isolates circulating during the years 1932-2007 was estimated to be 1.46 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year, and the most recent common ancestor of the virus it existed approximately 481 years ago. . The Bayesian horizon plot revealed a population expansion in the early 20th century followed by a rapid decline in population size from the late 20th century to the present.

2371,Polymerase chain reaction-based genetic typing of Japanese porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses (PRRSV) are classified into 2 different genotypes: the North American type and the European type. Japanese PRRSVs were genotyped by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using the reported primer pairs that were reactive to both types, North American type-specific or European type-specific. All PRRSV genomes from 66 tissue homogenates or sera and 55 infectious viruses were North American type, while no European type viral genome was detected. Two North American type-specific PCR primers showed different detection efficiency. Half of the tissue samples and 15% of the infectious viruses were not detected with one primer pair, although all were detected with the other primer pair. Nucleotide sequencing analysis of the forward and reverse primer binding sites of the non-reactive viruses indicated that all of these viruses had nucleotide mismatches within 4 bases corresponding to the 3'' end of the reverse primer. These mismatches appeared to be responsible for the lack of reactivity of the above primers to these viruses.",,"Yoshii, M.;Kaku, Y.;Murakami, Y.;Shimizu, M.;Kato, K.;Ikeda, H.",2004.0,,,0
2372,Molecular and serological epidemiology of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) on a remote island off western Japan: an implication of JEV migration over the East China Sea,"Background: Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Every year, between 1 and 10 cases with severe central nervous system symptoms are consistently reported in Japan. To clarify the mechanism of JEV maintenance, the present study surveyed pigs for serological evidence of JEV infection and isolated JEV strains from pigs and mosquitoes in Isahaya City (Isahaya) and Goto City (Goto) in the United States. Goto islets in Nagasaki prefecture from 2008 to 2014. Results: The serological survey of pigs showed the increase in IgM seropositivity against JEV in July or August, and was maintained until October or November in both Isahaya and Goto every year. years. Forty-seven JEV strains were isolated in Nagasaki between 2001 and 2014, including the strains in this study, and belonged to genotype 1. Thirty-four of the isolates were from pigs in Isahaya and classified into six subgroups (1-A-1 , 1-A-2, 1-A-3, 1-A-4, 1-A-5 and 1-A-9). Thirteen strains were isolated from pigs and mosquitoes in Goto and classified into three subgroups (1-A-5 (2008), 1-A-1 (2009), and 1-A-2). In the 1-A-2 subgroup, three different monophyletic subgroups, 1-A-2-2 (2010), 1-A-2-3 (2011), and 1-A-2-1 (2013, 2014), appeared. in goto. Conclusions: These data strongly suggested that the occurrence of JEV on Goto appears to be dependent on frequent introduction of JEV from off-island and this pattern is different from what has been observed on subtropical islands in the East China Sea such as Okinawa and Taiwan. , where the same JEV populations (1-A-7 (1998-2008) in Okinawa; genotype 3 (until 2012) in Taiwan) have been maintained for a long period.",,"Yoshikawa, A.;Nabeshima, T.;Inoue, S.;Agoh, M.;Morita, K.",2016.0,,10.1186/s41182-016-0010-0,0

In Fukuoka, HFMD associated with CV-A6 caused epidemics in 2013, 2015 and 2017. This article reports the genetic characteristics of CV-A6 whole viral protein 1 (VP1) derived from HFMD patients in Fukuoka between 2013 and 2017. CV-A6 was detected in 105 of 280 clinical samples, and the Complete VP1 sequences could be analyzed for 90 of the 105 specimens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CV-A6 strains were classified in clade A and subgrouped in subclade A3 or subclade A4. Each subclade strain carried amino acid substitutions in the putative DE and GH loops of VP1, and no amino acid substitutions were identified as detrimental to protein function. No significant differences in clinical symptoms were found between the genetic subclades using statistical analyses. In conclusion, this study clarified the genetic diversity of CV-A6 in Fukuoka between 2013 and 2017. The occurrence of CV-A6 strains was classified into new derived subclades based on phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene that can cause CV-associated diseases. A6.

2375,Isolation and genetic characterization of avian H1N1 influenza viruses and novel H1N2 reassortant influenza viruses from pigs in China,"Since pigs are susceptible to human and avian influenza viruses, they have been proposed as intermediate hosts or mixing vessels for the generation of pandemic influenza viruses through reassortment or adaptation to the mammalian host. In this study, we report avian-type H1N1 influenza viruses and novel H1N2 influenza viruses in pigs in China. Phylogenetic and homology analyzes showed that the H1N1 virus (A/swine/Zhejiang/1/07) closely resembled avian-type H1N1 viruses and appeared to be derived from European swine H1N1 viruses, which were first reported in China ; and the two H1N2 viruses (A/swine/Shanghai/1/07 and A/swine/Guangxi/13/06) were novel reassortant H1N2 influenza viruses that contained genes from the classical pig (HA, NP, M, and NS), human (NA and PB1) and avian (PB2 and PA) lineages, which indicated that reassortment between human, avian, and swine influenza viruses had occurred in pigs in China and resulted in the generation of new viruses. The isolation of avian H1N1 influenza viruses that originated from European swine H1N1 viruses, especially the emergence of two new reassortant H1N2 influenza viruses, provides further evidence that swine serve as intermediate hosts or ""recipients of infection"". mixture"", and surveillance of the swine flu virus in China should give it a high priority. © 2009.",,"Yu, H.;Zhang, P.

2376,Genetic diversity of H9N2 influenza viruses from pigs in China: a potential threat to human health?,"Pandemic strains of influenza A virus can arise from genetic reassortment between viruses from different hosts. Pigs are susceptible to human and avian influenza viruses and have been proposed as intermediate hosts or mixing vessels for the generation of pandemic influenza viruses through reassortment or adaptation to the mammalian host. In this study, we summarized and reported for the first time the coexistence of 10 genotypes (AJ) in pigs in China by analyzing all eight genes of 28 porcine H9N2 viruses isolated in China between 1998 and 2007. Porcine H9N2 viruses in genotype A and B were derived entirely from Y280-like and Shanghai/F/98-like viruses, respectively, indicating that cross-species transmission of H9N2 viruses from birds to pigs did exist in China. The other eight genotype (CJ) viruses could be double reassortant viruses, in which six genotype (EJ) viruses possessed 1-4 H5-like gene segments, indicating that they were reassortants of H9 and H5 viruses. In conclusion, the genetic diversity of H9N2 influenza viruses from pigs in China provides further evidence that interspecies transmission of H9N2 viruses between birds and pigs did occur and could result in the generation of new reassortant viruses by genetic reassortment with viruses. of swine influenza H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2. therefore, these H9N2 swine influenza viruses could be a potential threat to human health and continued surveillance of the swine influenza virus in China is of great importance. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",,"Yu, H.;Zhou, Y.

2377,Additional evidence of infection of pigs with human-like H1N1 influenza viruses in China,"Classical swine and avian-type H1N1 influenza viruses have been widely reported in the swine population worldwide, but human-type H1N1 swine viruses have been reported occasionally. In 2006, a human-like H1N1 swine virus (A/swine/Guangdong/96/06) was isolated from pigs in Guangdong province and reported in China for the first time. To obtain further evidence for infection of pigs with human-type H1N1 influenza viruses, we analyzed eight gene segments from three human-type swine H1N1 viruses (A/swine/Guangdong/96/06, A/swine/Tianjin/01/04 and A/swine/Henan/01/06) isolated in China. All eight genes of the three viruses are highly homologous to recent (circa 2000s) and early (1980s) H1N1 human influenza viruses, respectively. Phylogenetic analyzes revealed that A/Swine/Guangdong/96/06 was directly derived from approximately 2,000 H1N1 human influenza viruses, while A/swine/Tianjin/01/04 and A/swine/Henan/01/06 appeared to be descendants. of humans.

To better understand the spectrum of viruses present in pigs, we used the 454 Life Sciences GS-FLX high-throughput sequencing platform to sequence stool samples from healthy pigs. Recommendations. Total nucleic acid was extracted from fecal samples of healthy piglets and randomly amplified. The amplified materials were pooled and processed using a high-throughput pyrosequencing technique. Raw sequences were deconvoluted on the basis of barcode and then processed through a standardized bioinformatics pipeline. The unique reads (348, 70, and 13) had limited similarity to known astroviruses, bocaviruses, and parechoviruses. Specific primers were synthesized to assess the prevalence of viruses in healthy piglets. Our results indicate extremely high rates of positivity. Conclusions: Various astroviruses, bocaviruses and Ljungan-like viruses were identified in fecal samples from healthy pigs. The isolation rates of the new viruses were high.

The complete genome of the virus comprises 6832 bp, encoding a predicted 2132 amino acid polyprotein that is very similar to Ljungan virus (32% identity). During the preparation of this article, a similar virus belonging to a new genus Picornaviridae, named porcine passivirus 1 (SPaV-1), was reported. Sequence analysis revealed that PLV-CHN and SPaV1 shared 82% nucleotide identity and 89% amino acid identity. Further genomic and phylogenetic analyzes suggested that both SPaV1 and PLV-CHN shared similar genomic features and belonged to the same novel genus Picornaviridae. A total of 36 (20.0%) fecal samples from 180 healthy piglets tested positive for PLV-CHN by RT-PCR, while there were no fecal samples from 100 healthy children and 100 children with diarrhea, and no cerebrospinal fluid samples from 196 piglets. children with suspected virus. encephalitis, tested positive for the virus. However, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and Western blots using the recombinant PLV-CHN VP1 polypeptide as antigen showed a high seroprevalence of 63.5% in the healthy population. When grouped by age, the antibody positivity rates showed that most children under the age of 12 had been infected with the virus.

The full length of the cloned segment A contains 3259 nucleotides, which includes two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1 and ORF2, flanked by 5' and 3' non-coding regions. These strains shared high sequence identity with each other at the nucleotide or deduced amino acid level. Strains HZ2 and JD1 were closely related to two attenuated strains, CEF94 and P2, while ZJ2000 was closely related to two other virulent strains, Cu-1 and Harbin. Four amino acid substitutions at positions 253, 279, 284 and 330 were also observed in these three strains, a common feature of the more virulent and attenuated strains. Two major hydrophilic peaks were conserved in all three strains; however, there are two amino acid substitutions at positions 280 (N to S) and 290 (M to L) in the second minor hydrophilic peak for all three strains, which could have a critical influence on antigenicity. Two amino acid substitutions near the VP2-VP4 cleavage site were identified in the virulent strain JZ2000, which might be involved in the increased virulence of the virus.

To reveal the genomic organization and characterize the HNX strain, the complete genomes of the HNX and Fa strains, an isolate in the 1960s, were sequenced and analyzed. The genomic size of the HNX and Fa strains was 142,294 and 141,930 nt, respectively. , with corresponding G + C contents of 73.56 and 73.70%. The two strains consistently possessed 70 open reading frames. Furthermore, a comparative genomic analysis between the HNX and Bartha strains was performed to understand the possible reason for the immune failure. The major virulence-associated genes of the HNX strain had slight changes, while the HNX strain glycoprotein B and glycoprotein C genes had 73 mutations; the homology at the total genomic level between the HNX and Bartha strains was 90.6%. Genome-wide comparison between HNX and Fa strains indicated that the strains shared about 96.4% homology and clustered in a separate Chinese isolate; the two strains are also distant from isolates from other countries. Similarity plot and whole genome sequence scan analysis of nine PRV strains, including HNX and Fa, four new Chinese strains and three traditional reference strains, revealed that non-recombination events occurred in the HNX strain.

Live bird markets were suspected locations of sources of human H7N9 infection, based on exposure history of cases and sequence similarities between viral isolates. To explore the role of live poultry markets in the origin of the novel H7N9 virus, we systematically screened poultry and environmental specimens from local markets and farms in Hangzhou, using real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). PCR), as well as the next high-throughput test. - generation sequencing (NGS). RT-PCR identified positive specimens for the H7 and N9 genomic segments in all 12 poultry markets epidemiologically linked to 10 human cases of H7N9. Chickens, ducks, and environmental specimens from markets contained highly mixed subtypes, including H7, N9, H9, and N2, and sometimes H5 and N1. The idea of coexistence of H7N9 and H9N2 subtypes in chickens was further supported by metagenomic sequencing. In contrast, all cases of human H7N9 infection (n=31) were negative for H9N2 virus by real-time RT-PCR. The six internal segments were indistinguishable for the H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H9, N2 and internal segment sequences were very similar to the sequence of the H9N2 virus recently circulating in chickens in China. Our results provide direct evidence that H9N2 strains coexisted with novel human pathogenic H7N9 influenza virus in epidemiologically linked live bird markets.

Here, we examine poultry specimens from live bird markets linked to human H7N9 infection in Hangzhou, China. Metagenomic sequencing revealed mixed subtypes (H5, H7, H9, N1, N2, and N9). Subsequently, subtypes H5N9, H7N9 and H9N2 of AIV were isolated. Evolutionary analysis showed that the hemagglutinin gene of the novel H5N9 virus originated from A/muscovy duck/Vietnam/LBM227/2012 (H5N1), which belongs to clade 2.3.2.1. The neuraminidase gene of the novel H5N9 virus originated from A/Hangzhou/1/2013 (H7N9) infectious for humans. The six internal genes were similar to those of other virus strains H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2. The virus harbored the PQRERRRKR/GL motif characteristic of highly pathogenic AIVs at the HA cleavage site. Receptor binding experiments showed that the virus binds to α-2,3-sialic acid but not to α-2,6-sialic acid. Identically, pathogenicity experiments also showed that the virus caused low mortality rates in mice. This newly isolated H5N9 virus is a highly pathogenic reassortant virus that originates from subtypes H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2. Live bird markets represent a potential transmission risk to public health and the poultry industry.",,"Yu, Y.;Wang, X.;Jin, T.;Wang, H.;Si, W.;Yang, H.;Wu, J.;Yan, Y.;Liu, G.;Sang, X.;Wu, X.;Gao, Y.;Xia, X.;Yu, X.;Pan, J.;Gao, G.

2386,"Hepatitis E virus: transmission by food, water and zoonoses","Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is responsible for epidemics and endemics of acute hepatitis in humans, mainly through zoonotic, water and food transmission routes. HEV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus classified in the family Hepeviridae and encompasses four known genotypes (1-4), at least two new putative mammalian HEV genotypes, and a floating genus of avian HEV. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 only affect humans, while genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic and responsible for sporadic and autochthonous infections in both humans and several other animal species worldwide. HEV has an ever-expanding host range and has been identified in numerous animal species. Pigs serve as a reservoir species for transmission of HEV to humans; however, it is likely that other animal species may also act as reservoirs. HEV poses a significant public health problem with cases of the disease definitely linked to the handling of infected pigs, the consumption of raw or undercooked animal meats, and the contamination of drinking or irrigation water with animal manure. Infectious HEV has been identified in numerous sources of concern, including animal feces, sewage, improperly treated water, contaminated seafood and produce, and animal meats. Many aspects of HEV pathogenesis, replication, and immune responses remain unknown, as HEV is an extremely understudied but important human pathogen. This article reviews the current understanding of HEV transmission routes with an emphasis on dietary and environmental sources and the prevalence of HEV in animal species with zoonotic potential in humans. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Yugo, D.

2387,A new family of hybrid virophages from an animal gut metagenome,"Searching for virophage capsid protein homologues in metagenomic sequence databases resulted in the discovery of a new family of virophages in the sheep rumen metagenome. Rumen virophage (RVP) genomes encode a typical virophage major capsid protein, ATPase and protease combined with a B-family DNA polymerase primed with Polinton-like protein. RVP genomes appear to be linear molecules, with inverted terminal repeats. Thus, RVP appears to represent virophage-Polinton hybrids that are likely capable of forming infectious virions. Mimivirus virion proteins were detected in the same metagenomes as RVP, suggesting that virophages of the new family parasitize giant viruses that infect protist inhabitants of the rumen.",,"Yutin, N.;Kapitonov, V.

The specificity of this cross-reactivity was demonstrated by absorption using purified viral proteins, virus lysates, and extracts from infected cells. The data strongly suggested that the cross-reactive epitopes, termed CEs, differ from those responsible for cross-reactions between the major gag proteins of HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and STLV-I, and between those of BLV and HTLV. -I reported earlier. The prevalence of antibodies against EC was low, even among infected hosts with high titers against other epitopes present on the major gag proteins of homologous viruses. CE was not detected in any of the other type C or D retroviruses, or lentiviruses examined.

Specifically, isolates from pigeons and pigeons, members of the Columbidae family, were examined. APMV-1 is the causative agent of Newcastle disease, and the virus is associated with disease among a diverse number of bird species. Isolates of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) from pigeons have also been classified as pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1). Matrix protein gene sequences for PPMV-1 isolates were pooled as a group relative to isolates from other species phylogenetically. However, there were also pigeon or pigeon isolates that clustered with APMV-1 isolates from other species. This indicates that PPMV-1 may be circulating among members of the Columbidae as a distinct lineage, but that these bird species may also harbor other NDV strains. Of particular interest was a pigeon isolate from Europe that had an aberrant fusion protein cleavage site and was a phylogenetically peripheral member between the two main groups of APMV-1 isolates.",,"Zanetti, F.;RodrÃ­guez, M.;King, D.

2395,Phylogeography and phylodynamics of European genotype 3 hepatitis E virus,"Hepatitis E virus is classified into four genotypes that have different geographic and host distributions. The main cause of sporadic indigenous type E acute hepatitis in developed countries is genotype 3, which has a worldwide distribution and widely infects pigs. The aim of this study was to formulate hypotheses about the origin and global dispersal routes of this genotype by reconstructing the spatial and temporal dynamics of 208 HEV genotype 3 ORF-2 sequences (retrieved from public databases) isolated in different geographic areas. Evolutionary rates, time of most recent common ancestors (tMRCA), epidemic growth, and HEV-3 phylogeography were co-estimated using a Bayesian MCMC method. The clade maximum credibility tree showed the existence of two distinct main clades: clade A, consisting of only the European subtypes (HEV-3e and 3f), and clade B, consisting of the European subtype 3c and all HEV-3c subtypes. Asian subtypes (3a, 3b, and 3d) that share a common ancestor, which most likely existed in Asia in the 1920s. All North American isolates belonged to the Asian 3a subtype.

2396,New ecological aspects of hantavirus infection: A paradigm shift and a prevention challenge - A review,"In recent decades, a significant number of hitherto unknown or underestimated pathogens have emerged as fundamental dangers to the health of the human population despite intense research and exceptional efforts by modern medicine to address and eradicate infectious diseases. Almost all incidents caused by such emerging pathogens could be attributed to agents that are zoonotic or have expanded their host range and crossed species barriers. Many different factors influence the status of a pathogen so that it goes unnoticed or becomes a global threat. The ability of an infectious agent to adapt to changing environmental conditions and variations in human behaviour, population development, nutrition, education, health and social status are relevant factors affecting the correlation between the pathogen and the guest. Hantaviruses belong to the emerging pathogens that have gained increasing attention in recent decades. These viruses are members of the Bunyaviridae family and are grouped into a separate genus known as Hantaviruses. Hantaan (HTN), Seoul (SEO), Puumala (PUU), and Dobrava (DOB) virus serotypes predominantly cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a disease characterized by kidney failure, bleeding, and shock. In the recent past, many hantavirus isolates were identified and classified in hitherto unaffected geographic regions in the New World (North, Central, and South America) with characteristic features that affect the lungs of infected persons and cause a pulmonary syndrome. sharp. The hantavirus outbreaks in the United States of America in the early 1910s fundamentally changed our understanding of the occurrence of hantavirus-specific clinical picture, mortality, origin, and route of transmission in humans. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was first recognized in 1993 in the Four Corners region of the United States and had a case fatality rate of over 50%. Although the causative virus was first named in relation to the geographical name of the region of the outbreak, analysis of the individual viruses indicates that the causative virus of HPS was a genetically distinct hantavirus and was therefore named Sin Nombre virus. Hantaviruses are distributed worldwide and are believed to share a long period of coevolution with specific rodent species as their natural reservoir. The degree of relatedness between virus serotypes usually coincides with the relatedness between their respective hosts. No diseases are known to be associated with hantavirus infections in rodents, underscoring the friendly relationship between virus and host developed by mutual interaction over hundreds of thousands of years. Although rodents are the main reservoir, antibodies to hantaviruses are also present in domestic and wild animals such as cats, dogs, pigs, cattle, and deer. Domestic animals and rodents live together in a similar habitat. Therefore, transmission of hantaviruses from rodents to domestic animals appears possible if the target organs, tissues, and cell parenchyma of cohabiting domestic animals possess suitable virus receptors and are suitable for hantavirus entry and replication. The most likely incidental infection of species other than rodents, such as humans, renders hantaviruses from harmless to life-threatening pathogens, drawing attention to this group of viruses, their ecology, and evolution to prevent the human population from becoming harmless. suffer a serious health risk. Much more study of the influence of unnatural hosts on hantavirus ecology is needed to understand the directions that hantavirus evolution might take. At the very least, domestic animals that share their environmental habitat with rodents and humans, particularly in areas known to be highly endemic for hantaviruses, should be extensively screened. Each transfer of hantaviruses from their original natural hosts to other hosts, often incidental, is accompanied by a change of ecology, a change of environment, a modulation of numerous factors that probably influence the pathogenicity and virulence of the virus. The new environment puts modified evolutionary pressure on the virus forcing it to adapt and probably take a form that is much more dangerous to other host species compared to the original. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"Zeier, M.;Handermann, M.;Bahr, U.;Rensch, B.;MÃ¼ller, S.;Kehm, R.;Muranyi, W.;Darai, G.",2005.0,,10.1007/s11262-004-5625-2,0

Molecular data indicate that bovine enteroviruses are composed of two groups (designated BEV-A and -B) each with two and three geno-/serotypes, respectively. While the low amino acid identity of capsid proteins 1C (VP3) and 1D (VP1) is the main criterion for geno-/serotype discrimination, the BEV groups, presumably representing species, differ in identity. sequence of all viral proteins.

2399,Application of genome sequence information to the classification of bovine enteroviruses: the importance of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions,"Comparative genomics of viruses in evolutionary and phylogenetic studies is well established. Previous nucleic acid sequence analyzes have shown that enteroviruses and rhinoviruses of the Picornaviridae family exhibit a similar 5'-untranslated region (NTR) structure that differs significantly from the 5'-NTR of cardioviruses, aphthoviruses, hepatoviruses, and hepatoviruses. echovirus 22 (provisionally parechovirus). one). Available information on the nucleotide sequence of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of more than 70 serotypes of enteroviruses, bovine enteroviruses, and rhinoviruses has been compared and correlated with previous findings obtained after analysis of the coding and non-coding regions of the genome. As a result, the 5' and 3' NTRs of all three groups of viruses are characterized by group-specific nucleotide sequences. Focusing on bovine enterovirus (BEV) serotypes, unique features were observed in all NTR secondary structures. These features clearly separate BEVs from human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. Regarding the 5'-NTR, the most notable property is an insertion of approximately 110 nucleotides between the putative cloverleaf structure at the 5' end of the viral genome and the IRES element. This insertion was demonstrated for BEV I and :! and has a predicted folding pattern that is very similar to the 5' cloverleaf structure. A stem loop of this second cloverleaf is nearly identical to the 3CD(pro) binding domain of the 5' cloverleaf of rhinovirus. IRES elements and 3'-NTRs of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses were also shown to have group-specific characteristics that differ significantly from the corresponding genome regions of BEV. These results suggest that bovine enteroviruses occupy a unique taxonomic position in addition to the established genera Enterovirus and Rhinovirus. Within the genera Enterovirus and Rhinovirus, the existence of groups of viruses representing subgenera was previously proposed. While the 5'-NTRs of the four groups of human enteroviruses are divided into two groups, all four groups have characteristic secondary structures in the 3'-NTR that support the concept of groups of enteroviruses. For rhinoviruses, the existence of two groups of viruses was confirmed.",,"Zell, R.;Stelzner, A.",1997.0,,10.1016/s0168-1702(97)00096-8,0

Therefore, we performed high-throughput sequencing and transcriptomic analysis to identify functional miRNAs, in order to discover the possible mechanism in the interaction of REV with CEF. In total, 50 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified. Then, the target genes of the DEmiRNAs were predicted and identified using the transcriptome profiling results. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment was carried out to analyze the identified target genes of miRNAs, showing that metabolism, cell cycle and apoptosis were the most related pathways involved in infection of REV. We analyzed cell cycle-related genes that indicated that the CyclinD1-CDK6 complex played an important role in regulating the cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase during REV infection. Identification by fluorescence microscopy showed that REV inhibited CEF apoptosis, which was in agreement with the transcriptome results. A new miRNA, called novel-72, was found, KEGG analysis was performed to predict the biological function of its target genes, showing that those target genes were significantly enriched in the mTOR signaling pathway and function to promote the cell cycle and cell growth during REV infection. .

An average of 5.5 different viruses were excreted in piglets with diarrhoea, and in fact one piglet was co-infected with 11 different viruses. In contrast, healthy piglets shed an average of 3.2 different viruses. Compared to samples from healthy piglets, PEDV and PBoV coinfection had a high prevalence rate in diarrhea samples, suggesting a correlation with the occurrence of diarrhea in piglets.

2404,Identification and characterization of a new rodent bocavirus from different rodent species in China,"Members of the Bocaparvovirus genus are closely related to human health and have a wide host range. Host diversity raises the possibility of crossing the species barrier, which is a characteristic of emerging viruses. Among mammalian hosts, rodents are generally recognized as important reservoirs of emerging viruses. In this case, rodent samples collected from six provinces and autonomous regions of China (Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Yunnan) were used to investigate the prevalence and distribution of bocaparvoviruses. By first using next-generation sequencing, a partial nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) gene belonging to a putative new bocaparvovirus was discovered. Next, a PCR-based NS1 gene screen was carried out on 485 rodent samples, and 106 positive results were found in seven rodent species (Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Apodemus agrarius, Cricetulus barabensis, Rattus flavipectus, Rattus rattus and Rhombomys opimus). Ultimately, six near-complete genomes and three complete CDSs were obtained and the newly identified bocaparvovirus was tentatively named rodent bocavirus (RoBoV). RoBoV has three ORFs: NS1, NP1, and VP, which are characteristic of bocaparvoviruses. Phylogenetic analyzes revealed that the porcine bocavirus isolate PBoV-KU14, a member of Ungulate bocaparvovirus 4, was the most closely related virus to RoBoV, with 92.1-92.9% amino acid identities in the NS1 protein. RoBoV-related sequence alignments showed that RoBoV isolates could be classified into two clades, demonstrating genetic diversity between hosts.

2407,Characterization of an Enterovirus E species isolated from naturally infected cattle in China,"Bovine enteroviruses, which belong to the Picornaviridae family, can cause clinical symptoms in cattle and are excreted in faeces. In this study, a Madin-Darby bovine kidney cell killer virus (MDBK) was isolated from fecal samples of cattle with severe diarrhea and hemorrhagic intestinal mucosa that had originally been diagnosed with bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) due to a diarrhea virus. bovine viral Ag point-of-care test (IDEXX, USA). Random priming PCR was used to amplify the underlying viral sequences and identify the isolated virus. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the isolated virus closely resembles the EV-E2 species, which is different from other previously isolated Chinese strains. The newly identified virus was named HLJ-3531/2013. We infected the cranky mice with the isolated virus. Reverse transcription PCR, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, serum neutralization (SN) test, and virus isolation from various tissues revealed that HLJ-3531/2013 can infect the intestine, liver, and lungs. of suckling mice.

2408,Genome-wide analysis of differentially expressed genes and modulation of PEDV infection in Vero E6 cells,"PEDV remains one of the most important swine diseases infecting pigs of all ages. It causes a devastating viral enteric disease in piglets with a high mortality rate, creating significant threats and huge economic losses to the swine industry. In this study, a transcriptomic shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) procedure was used to study gene responses against PEDV infection. A genome-wide analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed in Vero E6 cells after PEDV infection. The mTOR signaling pathway activator-MHY1485 and inhibitor-PP242 were used to study antiviral function. The results revealed that IRF3 was significantly upregulated after PEDV infection. Although most of the IFN-related and regulatory genes evaluated in this study were downregulated or unchanged, IL11 was significantly upregulated, peaking at 16 hpi. Nearly 90% of PEDV infections were suppressed in PP242-pretreated cells, while the reverse effect was observed in MYH1485-pretreated cells. The results indicated that the mTOR signaling pathway played a vital role in the antiviral regulation of PEDV in Vero E6 cells.

According to the classification of the viral protein encoded by ORF2 (VP1), the six reported porcine bocaviruses were grouped into four species: PoBoV1 (porcine mouth-like virus or PBoLV), PoBoV2 (porcine parvovirus 4 or PPV4), PoBoV3 (PBoV1/ PBoV2) and PoBoV4 (6V/7V), with PoBoV3 and PoBoV4 each having two virus genotypes. All four PoBoV species were detected in the 166 samples collected in 2010 from herds located in ten provinces of China. The detection rates of PoBoV1-4 were 28·9%, 6·6%, 19·3% and 39·7%, respectively. The co-infection combinations involving these six porcine bocaviruses in the collected samples were very complex.

2411,"Molecular characterization and seroprevalence in pigs of SC0806, a Cat Que virus isolated from mosquitoes in Sichuan province, China","The Simbu serogroup currently consists of a highly diverse group of related arboviruses that infect both humans and economically important livestock species. Cat Que virus (CQV), a virus of the Simbu serogroup of the genus Orthobunyavirus (family Bunyaviridae), was first isolated in 2004 from mosquitoes during surveillance of arbovirus activity in acute pediatric encephalitis in northern Vietnam. We present here the complete genome sequence of SC0806 isolated from mosquitoes (Culex tritaeniorhynchus) in Sichuan province, China. According to the genomic organization of Simbu serogroup viruses, the SC0806 genome consists of three RNA segments: a large (L) segment (6928 nucleotides) encoding the 2261 amino acid RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a medium ( M) (4481 nucleotides) encoding the 1433 amino acid polyprotein and a small segment (S) (984 nucleotides) encoding a 234 amino acid nucleocapsid protein and a 95 amino acid non-structural protein. The respective lengths of the 5"" untranslated region (UTR) and the 3"" UTR of L, M, and S are 56 and 86, 43 and 136, and 44 and 238 nucleotides. Sequence comparison (nucleotide and deduced amino acids) and phylogenetic analysis revealed that SC0806 was closely related to the reported CQV isolate from Vietnam. This is the first time that CQV has been isolated in Sichuan province, China.

We developed and applied a procedure for high-throughput RNA sequencing of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from clinical samples and cell culture-derived isolates. Ten PRRSV isolates with known sequence information, 2 pools each containing 2 different PRRSV isolates, and 51 clinical samples (19 sera, 16 lungs, and 16 oral fluids) with various PCR threshold cycle (Ct) values were subjected to extraction. nucleic acid, cDNA library preparation (24-plexed) and sequencing. Whole genome sequences were obtained from 10 reference isolates with expected sequences and from PRRSV real-time reverse transcription PCR sera with Ct ≤ 23.6, lung tissues with Ct ≤ 21, and oral fluids with Ct ≤ 20.6. For pools with PRRSV-1 and -2 isolates (57.8% nucleotide identity), NGS was able to distinguish them and obtain their respective genomic sequences. For pools with 2 PRRSV-2 isolates (92.4% nucleotide identity), nucleotide ambiguous sequence reads were observed at multiple sites, indicating a mixed infection; however, individual virus sequences can only be separated when the identity and sequence of 1 isolate in the pool is known.

It causes mortality of up to 80% in broilers from 3 to 6 weeks of age, posing a significant threat to the poultry industry. However, the specific host responses to the virus are not well understood. To better understand host-FAdV-4 interactions and explore the pathogenesis of this virus, high-throughput RNA sequencing technology was used with Leghorn male hepatocellular (LMH) cells at 12, 24, and 48 h after infection. AVF-. 4 infection. We identified a total of 7000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were enriched in a variety of biological processes and pathways using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Several pathways related to the immune system, including the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway and the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, were activated after FAdV-4 infection. Transcriptional data was validated by real-time quantitative PCR. Expression profiles of 10 implicated genes in FAdV-4-infected chicken livers, including TLR2A, TLR3, TLR5, MyD88, IL12B, IL15, IL18, CCL20, TNFRSF21, and CD30, were consistent with RNA-seq profiles. By transfecting small interfering RNAs into LMH cells, our results confirmed that MyD88 mediated FAdV-4-induced inflammation.

Consistent with our previous RNA sequencing analysis, differences in susceptibility to PCV2 infection depended on genetic differences between Laiwu (LW) and Yorkshire × Landrace (YL) crossbred pigs, but cellular microRNA (miRNA ) that is differentially expressed remains to be determined between LW and YL pigs before and after PCV2 infection. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was performed to determine the abundance and differential expression of miRNA in lung tissues from PCV2-infected and uninfected LW and YL pigs. In total, 295 known and 95 new miRNAs were identified, and 23 known and 25 new miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in PCV2-infected versus PCV2-infected LW pigs and/or PCV2-infected versus PCV2-infected YL pigs. those not infected with PCV2.

2418,"Characterization and Complete Genome Sequence Analysis of a Novel Virulent Siphoviridae Phage Against Staphylococcus aureus Isolated from Bovine Mastitis in Xinjiang, China","Bovine mastitis is one of the most costly diseases in dairy cows worldwide. It can be caused by more than 150 different microorganisms, Staphylococcus aureus being the most frequently isolated and one of the main pathogens responsible for great economic losses in the dairy industry. Although antibiotic therapy is the most widely used, alternative treatments are needed due to increasing antibiotic resistance. The use of phages for pathogen control is a promising tool in the fight against antibiotic resistance. Primarily using high-throughput sequencing, bioinformatics, and our proposed terminal phage identification method, we have isolated and characterized a new virulent phage, designated vB_SauS_IMEP5, from manure collected from dairy farms in Shihezi, Xinjiang, China, for use as a targeting agent. Biological control against Staphylococcus aureus infections. Its latency period was about 30 min and its burst size was about 272 PFU/cell. Phage vB_SauS_IMEP5 survives in a wide pH range between 3 and 12. Treatment at 70°C for 20 min can inactivate the phage. Morphological analysis of vB_SauS_IMEP5 revealed that the phage vB_SauS_IMEP5 morphologically resembles phages of the family Siphoviridae. Among our multiplicity of infections (MOI) tested, the optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) of this phage was determined to be 0.001, suggesting that phage vB_SauS_IMEP5 has high bacteriolytic potential and good efficiency in reducing bacterial growth. The complete genome of IME-P5 is a linear double-stranded DNA of 44,677 bp, with a G+C content of 34.26%, containing 69 putative ORFs. Genome termini were determined with next-generation sequencing data using our previously proposed terminus identification method, suggesting that this phage has non-redundant termini with sticky 9nt 3â€² protruding ends. The genomic and proteomic characteristics of IMEP5 demonstrate that this phage does not belong to any of the previously recognized Siphoviridae Staphylococcus phage groups, suggesting the creation of a new lineage, thus increasing knowledge about the diversity of Staphylococcus phages. An N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase gene and several conserved genes were predicted, while no virulence or antibiotic resistance genes were identified.

2421,Transcript Profiling Identifies Early Response Genes Against FMDV Infection in PK-15 Cells,"Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious disease that causes huge economic losses throughout the world. Although the protection provided by vaccination is limited during early infection, it is recognized as the best method of preventing FMD outbreaks. Furthermore, the mechanism of early host responses against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection remains unclear. In our study, a pig kidney cell line (PK-15) was used as a cell model to reveal the mechanism of early responses of pigs to FMD virus infection. Four untreated and four FMDV-treated control PK-15 cells were sequenced with RNA-seq technology, and differentially expressed genes (DEG) were analyzed. The results showed that 1212 DEGs were in FMDV-infected PK-15 cells, including 914 upregulated and 298 downregulated genes. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were significantly enriched in tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, NOD-like receptor, toll-like receptor, NF-kappaB and chemokine signaling pathways. To verify the DEG results, 30 immune-related DEGs (19 upregulated and 11 downregulated) were selected for quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) verification. Results showed that genes measured by RT-qPCR exhibited a pattern similar to that of RNA-seq analyses. Based on bioinformatic analysis, during early FMD virus infection, we found that a number of cytokines, such as interleukins (IL6), chemokines (CXCL2, CCL20, and CCL4), and transcription factors (ZFP36, FOS, NFKBIA, ZBTB3, ZNF503, ZNF283, dymeclin (DYM) and orthodenticle homeobox 1 (OTX1)) were involved in the battle between the FMD virus and the host. Combined with its features and functions, we propose inflammation as the main early mechanism by which the host responds to FMD virus infection.

2422,Effects of PrPC on DF-1 cell biological processes and RNA-seq-based differential gene analysis,"Reveal the effects of PrPC on cell biological processes and gene expression. We established stable DF-1 (PrPC-knockdown (KD)) cells and, combined with DF-1 (wt) and DF-1 (PrPC overexpression (OE)) cells that we previously established, studied the effects of chicken PrPC ( PrPC) in the processes of DF-1 cells. Then, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology and bioinformatics, we analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between these cells. The results show that, compared to DF-1 (wt) and DF-1 (PrPC-scramble), DF-1 (PrPC-KD) significantly decreases in adhesion, proliferation, colony formation rate and cell number of colony, scratch wound healing rate, number of invasion and migration cells, cell populations in S phase, but the rate of apoptosis and cell populations in G1 phase are significantly increased. On the contrary, all these characteristics in DF-1 (PrPC-OE) are opposite. Furthermore, compared to DF-1 (wt), we found that there are a total of 1055 DE genes between DF-1 (PrPC-KD) and DF-1 (PrPC-OE) cells. After Go and pathway enrichment analysis, we know that these DEGs are significantly enriched in the cell, cell part, cell process, and metabolic pathway. In summary, we found that PrPC can promote the processes of DF-1 cells except apoptosis. In addition, PrPC is involved in focal adhesion, cancer, ribosomes, metabolic pathways, etc., and PrPC overexpression can promote amebiasis pathway, but its downregulation can promote synapse pathway serotonergic.

2423,Evolution and variation of the H3 gene of influenza A virus and interaction between hosts,"Objective: Continuous mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of influenza A virus generate new antigenic strains that cause annual epidemics. The objective of this study was to evaluate the evolution trend of the H3 gene over a long period of time. Methods: 1842 H3 HA1 nucleotide strains from different hosts were collected for analysis. A two-step clustering method was used to divide strains into groups, and then a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the clustering results. The rate of evolution in lineages was estimated in the future. Results: The structure of the tree showed three lineages: equine/canine, human/porcine and avian. As a single trunk, the human/pig lineage was composed primarily of human strains, with more large branches appearing in recent years. The tree topology showed no evidence that pigs affected the main evolutionary trend of human H3 strains. The rate of evolution of H3 strains varied between lineages. We found that the rate in the human lineage decreased from 3.2 substitutions/year before 1980 to 1.8 after 1997. Conclusion: We concluded that human H3 gene variation was associated with porcine strains but was independent of others, including bird strains. The rate of evolution of human H3 strains appears to have decreased in recent years, while the reasons for the rate change need to be further explored.

The inhibition test confirmed infection with HEV or HEV-like viruses in these domestic animals, except pigeons and chickens. From the sera, we isolated 18 porcine HEV strains, one horse HEV strain, and two human HEV strains. Sequence analysis showed that the horse HEV isolate and one pig isolate belonged to genotype 3.

2428,Comparisons of Virome in healthy captive and wild giant pandas,"Background: The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a vulnerable herbivorous mammal living in the wild in central China. Viral infections have become a potential health threat to these endangered animals, but limited information is available related to these infections. Methods: Using a viral metagenomics approach, we examined viruses in feces, nasopharyngeal secretions, blood, and different tissues from a wild giant panda that died of an unknown disease, a healthy wild giant panda, and 46 healthy captive animals. Results: Complete or near-complete previously uncharacterized genomes of four viruses from three genera in the family Papillomaviridae, six viruses in a proposed new genus Picornaviridae (Aimelvirus), two unclassified viruses related to posaviruses in the order Picornavirales, 19 anelloviruses in four different clades of Anelloviridae Four putative circoviruses and 15 viruses belonging to the recently described family Genomoviridae were sequenced. Reflecting the diet of giant pandas, numerous sequences of insect viruses related to the families Iflaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Iridoviridae, Baculoviridae, Polydnaviridae, and the subfamily Densovirinae, and sequences of plant viruses related to the families Tombusviridae, Partitiviridae, Secoviridae, Geminiviridae , Luteoviridae, Virgaviridae and Rhabdoviridae; The genera Umbravirus, Alphaflexiviridae, and Phycodnaviridae were also detected in fecal samples. A small number of insect virus sequences were also detected in the nasopharyngeal secretions of healthy giant pandas and lung tissues of dead wild giant pandas. Although the viral families present in the sick giant panda were also detected in the healthy ones, a higher proportion of papillomavirus, picornavirus, and anellovirus reads were detected in the sick panda. Conclusion: This viral survey increases our understanding of eukaryotic viruses in giant pandas and provides a baseline for comparison with viruses detected in future infectious disease outbreaks. Similar viral families detected in healthy and diseased giant pandas indicate that these viruses cause commensal infections in most immunocompetent animals.",,"Zhang, W.;Yang, S. X.;Shan, T.

2429,The hemagglutinin/esterase gene of human coronavirus strain OC43: phylogenetic relationships with bovine and murine coronaviruses and influenza C virus,"The complete nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) genes of human coronavirus (HCV) strain OC43 and bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV) strain G95 were determined from single-stranded cDNA fragments generated by reverse transcription of Virus-specific mRNAs amplified by polymerase chain reaction. An open reading frame of 1272 nucleotides was identified as the putative HE gene by homology to the bovine coronavirus HE gene. This open reading frame encodes a 424 amino acid protein with an estimated molecular weight of 47.7 kDa. Ten potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted in the HE protein of HCV-OC43, while nine of them were present in BRCV-G95. Fourteen cysteine residues were conserved in the HE proteins of both viruses. Two hydrophobic sequences at the N-terminus and the C-terminus can serve as the signal peptide and transmembrane anchor domain, respectively. The predicted HE protein from HCV-OC43 was 95% identical to HE from BRCV-G95 and other bovine coronaviruses, and 60% identical to HE from mouse hepatitis viruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the HE genes of coronaviruses and influenza C viruses have a common ancestral origin, and that bovine coronaviruses and HCV-OC43 are closely related.",,"Zhang, X.;Kousoulas, K.

2434,"Isolation and characterization of avian influenza A H7N9 virus from humans with respiratory diseases in Zhejiang, China","In 2013, the novel influenza A (H7N9) virus of avian origin reassortant was reported in China. Through enhanced surveillance, H7N9 virus infection in humans was first identified in Zhejiang province. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to confirm infection. Embryonated chicken eggs were used for virus isolation from throat swabs taken from infected human patients. H7N9 isolates were first identified by hemagglutination testing and electron microscopy, and then used for whole genome sequencing. Bioinformatics software was used to construct the phylogenetic tree and calculate the mean rate of evolution of the HA gene in H7Nx and NA in HxN9. Two novel avian influenza A H7N9 viruses (A/Zhejiang/1/2013 and A/Zhejiang/2/2013) were isolated from positive cases of infection. Substitutions were found in both Zhejiang isolates and they were identified as human-like viruses. All phylogenetic results indicated that the new rearrangement in H7N9 originated from viruses that infected birds. Genome-wide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the mean rate of evolution of the HA gene in H7NX was 5.74E-3 (95% highest posterior density: 3.8218E-3 to 7.7873E-3), while the NA gene showed 2,243 E-3 (4.378E-4 to 3.79E-3) substitutions per nucleotide site per year.

Fever, vesicular rash on hands, feet, mouth, and buttocks in most of the patients. Most of the patients were infants under 5 years of age and there was an obvious peak period in the outbreak of the disease. From 28 hospitalized patients, 23 stool samples and 6 throat swab samples were collected for enterovirus isolation, and 15 enteroviruses were isolated, 9 identified as Human Enterovirus 71 (HEV71, isolation rate is 31.03%) and 1 was identified as Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). Based on a comprehensive analysis of clinical manifestations, epidemiological data, and laboratory results, this outbreak was likely caused primarily by HEV71. The variability at the nucleotide and amino acid level among 9 HEV71s was relatively low, and the homology was greater than 99.4% and 99.0%, respectively, demonstrating that this outbreak was caused by a single chain of viral transmission. Phylogenetic analysis of 9 HEV71 strains isolated during this outbreak revealed that they all belonged to the C4 subgenotype, which has been circulating continuously in mainland China since its first appearance in the city of Shenzhen in 1998.

2436,The potential of the human immune system to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1: implications for vaccine development,"OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: The development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine that elicits broadly neutralizing human HIV-1 antibodies (bnAbs) remains a challenging goal. Extensive studies of HIV-1 have revealed several strategies employed by the virus to escape host immune surveillance. Here, we investigated the human antibody gene repertoires from uninfected and HIV-1-infected individuals at the genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA levels using deep sequencing followed by high-throughput sequence analysis to determine the gene frequencies of putative germline antibodies to known HIV-1 genes monoclonal bnAbs (bnmAbs). METHODS: Combinatorial gDNA and cDNA antibody libraries were constructed using gDNA and mRNA isolated from uninfected and HIV-1-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). All libraries were deep sequenced and sequences analyzed using IMGT/HighV-QUEST software (http://imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/index.action). The frequencies of putative germline antibodies to known bnmAbs in the gDNA and cDNA libraries were determined. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Human gDNA antibody libraries were more diverse in heavy and light chain V gene lineage usage than cDNA libraries, indicating that human gDNA antibody gene repertoires may have more potential than cDNA repertoires for developing HIV-1 bnAbs. The frequencies of heavy, kappa, and lambda light chain variable regions with V(D)J recombinations identical to known HIV-1 bnmAbs were extremely low in human antibody gene repertoires. However, we found relatively high frequencies of kappa and lambda light and heavy chain variable regions that used the same V genes and had the same CDR3 lengths as known HIV-1 bnmAbs, regardless of gene usage (D).

By RT-PCR, full-length cDNA of the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus envelope gene (exJSRV-env) was amplified from naturally infected sheep lung extract. The target gene clone was subcloned into the pEGFP-C1 eukaryotic expression system and validated by PCR, restriction endonuclease, and sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis on the biological function and cellular localization of exJSRV-env was also performed. The exJSRV-env recombinant clone was transfected into 293T cells and NIH3T3 cells by Lipofectamine LTX. Cell expression and localization in 293T cells were validated by confocal microscopy. The soft agar colony formation assay was used to test for anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3. DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion with Kpn I and Hind III indicated the correct construction of the recombinant plasmid, which was named pEGFP-C1/exJSRV-env. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of exJSRV-env with the reference sequences found 85% to 100% homogeneity. A YRNM motif was discovered in the envelope cytoplasmic tail gene, which is found exclusively in foreign viruses. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that our exJSRV-env clone clustered closely with pathogenic exogenous Jaagsiekte sheep retroviruses. Fluorescence microscopy indicated a typical membrane localization of exJSRV-env protein. NIH3T3 cells transfected with exJSRV-env lost contact inhibition and gained the ability to form colonies in soft agar.

2441,The unfolded protein response induced by Tembusu virus infection,"BACKGROUND: Tembusu virus (TMUV), classified in the genus Flavivirus, causes reduced egg production and neurological problems in poultry. Flavivirus replication depends on the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces ER stress leading to activation of the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), an important signaling pathway that regulates many biological functions involved in pathogenesis. viral and innate immunity. However, the mechanism of TMUV-induced UPR activation remains unclear. RESULTS: In this study, we systematically investigated the three UPR pathways in TMUV-infected BHK-21 cells. Our results showed that glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78) and GRP94 expression increased during the course of TMUV infection. We then showed that TMUV activated the PERK pathway early in infection, resulting in upregulation of ATF4, GADD34, and CHOP, with induction of CHOP leading to caspase-3 activation. We also found that the IRE1 pathway is activated, leading to splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA and enhanced expression of p58IPK. Finally, we observed increased expression of ATF6 and the activity of ER stress response elements, suggesting a stimulation of the ATF6 pathway. Furthermore, activation of the ATF6 pathway correlated with the induction of downstream chaperones calnexin, calreticulin, ERp57, and PDI. UPR activity was also observed by the marked elevation in GRP78 and sXBP1 levels in TMUV-infected DF-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that ER stress induced by TMUV infection activates three branches of the UPR, and these results lay the groundwork for elucidating the pathogenesis of TMUV and understanding the inherent mechanism of TMUV infection as well. as the host response.",,"Zhao, D.;Yang, J.;Han, K.;Liu, Q.;Wang, H.;Liu, Y.;Huang, X.;Zhang, L.;Li, Y.",2019.0,,10.1186/s12917-019-1781-4,0
2442,Transcriptomic analysis of porcine PBMC in response to foot-and-mouth disease virus infection,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an important zoonotic infectious disease. It has a significant economic impact throughout the world. In addition, it is a considerable threat to food security. At present, the molecular mechanism of FMD virus infection is not very clear. The innate immune response is the first line of defense against infectious diseases. Systematic analysis of the host immune response to infection has an important role in understanding the pathogenesis of infection. However, there are few reports on the effect of immune regulation on virus replication on virus-host cell interaction. High-throughput RNA-seq technology as a powerful and efficient means of transcript analysis provides a new insight into the study of FMD virus. In this study, RNA was extracted from swine PBMC infected with FMD virus subtype O at 4 dpi. A total of 29942658 and 31452917 Illumina read pairs were obtained from the uninfected group (NI) and the infected group (I), respectively. The clean bases for all samples are 3.61G (group NI) and 3.79G (group I), respectively. The clean reads of group NI and I that were assigned to the pig genome data were 47195073 (81.82%) and 46556714 (76.85%), respectively. Most of the clean reads were distributed in the exon region, followed by the intron region and the intergenic region. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were analyzed using edgeR software. 451 genes were differentially expressed between infected and uninfected groups. According to the comparison analysis, more genes were downregulated in the uninfected samples than in those infected with FMDV. 66 of 451 genes were downregulated, 385 of 451 genes were upregulated after FMDV infection. For function classification and pathway analysis, among 17,741 assembled unigenes, there are 349 genes that are different GO note genes. Additionally, 49 genes were downregulated, 300 genes were upregulated associated with the GO term. 1621 were successfully scored for GO assignments, belonging to one or more of three categories: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. According to KEGG analysis, the main pathway including protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, phagosome, cell cycle, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction was represented. Some key ED genes related to immune process and signaling pathways were analyzed and quantified by RT-PCR. This is the first systematic transcriptomic analysis of FMD virus-infected pig PBMC.

Results: Epidemiology revealed that H6N2 viruses were the most frequently detected influenza subtypes in live bird markets between 2002 and 2008 in eastern China, but from 2009 they were replaced by newer H6N6 viruses. We phylogenetically and antigenically analyzed 42 H6 viruses isolated mainly from domestic ducks between 2002 and 2010 in eastern China. Surprisingly, none of these isolates clustered with the previously described H6N2 viruses that belonged to a single lineage of H6N2 viruses with a single gene constellation in domestic ducks in southern China between 2000 and 2005. Two distinct hemagglutinin lineages were identified and all underwent frequent reassortment with multiple virus subtypes from the natural gene pool, but few reassortments were persistent or prevalent. Conclusions: Five H6 influenza virus subtypes (H6N1, H6N2, H6N5, H6N6, and H6N8) co-circulated in eastern China, which form an important part of the natural reservoir of influenza virus in domestic ducks, and is still in flux.

Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) was detected by nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) assay and sequenced within the 5â€² untranslated region of the genome. Approximately 43% (202 samples) were positive for BVDV. Of the positive samples, 24 were chosen for further sequencing, sequence comparisons, and phylogenetic reconstructions. Phylogenetic reconstructions showed that these isolates were grouped into subgenotypes BVDV1b (18 samples) or BVDV1c (6 samples). None of the sequenced isolates showed any cytopathic effect in culture. Unlike previously published studies in Chinese cattle, no BVDV2 genotypes were detected.

However, the role of exosomal miRNAs in the molecular mechanism of the synergistic infection of the two viruses remains unknown. RESULTS: In this study, exosomal RNAs from CEF cells infected with ALV-J, REV, or both at the optimal time of synergistic infection were analyzed by Illumina deep RNA sequencing. A total of 54 (23 upregulated and 31 downregulated) and 16 (7 upregulated and 9 downregulated) miRNAs were identified by comparing coinfection with two viruses, ALV-J and REV from one single infection, respectively. Furthermore, five key miRNAs, including miR-184-3p, miR-146a-3p, miR-146a-5p, miR-3538, and miR-155, were validated in both exosomes and CEF cells by qRT-PCR. GO annotation and KEGG pathway analysis of miRNA target genes showed that all five differentially expressed miRNAs were involved in virus-vector interaction, oxidative phosphorylation, energy metabolism, and cell growth.

Here we report the discovery of the first Sicinivirus isolate (designated as JSY strain) of picornaviruses from commercial laying hens in mainland China by using a viral metagenomics technique. This Sicinivirus isolate, which contains a complete genome of 9,797 nucleotides (nt) excluding the poly(A) tail, possesses one of the largest picornavirus genomes reported so far, but shares only 88.83% and 82.78% % amino acid sequence identity to that of ChPV1 100C (KF979332) and Sicinivirus 1 strain UCC001 (NC-023861), respectively. The entire 939 nt 50UTR of the isolate contains at least twelve stem loop (AL) domains, representing the highest set of loops reported within the Sicinivirus genus. The conserved 'rod-like' structure was also present in the 272 nt 30UTR of the isolate as in the 30UTR of Sicinivirus 1 strain UCC001. The 8586 nt large open reading frame encodes a 2862 amino acid polyprotein precursor.

2458,Characteristics of codon usage bias in two regions downstream of FMDV initiation codons,"The mechanism of utilization of the two alternative AUGs in foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is still unknown to date. In this study, the codon usage bias (CUB) characteristics of the region between the two AUGs (the La-region) and of the same-sized region behind the second AUG (the Lb-region) in 94 different sequences of FMDV RNA was analyzed using relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values. The results indicated that many CUB-negative codons were used preferentially in the La-region. There were two conserved residues (Thr and Cys) at the 4th and 6th residue positions of the La-region. The conserved residues had a general tendency to choose synonymous codons with negative CUB. Although most positions in the La region did not contain conserved residues, many positions tended to use negative CUB codons in this region. Among these codons, most belonged to amino acids that contained clearly CUB positive and negative synonymous codons, including Asp, Val, Ile, Leu, Thr, Ala, Ser, Asn, and Arg. The presence of many CUB negative codons in the region-La could impair the efficiency of the first AUG selection. The phylogenetic inconsistency of the La-region and the Lb-region implied that intertypic recombination played an important role in the evolution of FMD virus. In addition, due to the existence of more CUB-positive positions and the more extensive phylogenetic incongruence in the Lb-region than in the La-region, a likely relationship between the degree of CUB and the evolution of the two target regions was revealed. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",,"Zhou, J.

2459,Global landscapes of pairwise RNA interaction reveal central features of protein recognition,"RNA-protein interactions permeate biology. Transcription, translation, and splicing depend on the recognition of structured RNA elements by RNA-binding proteins. Models of RNA-protein interactions are generally limited to short linear structures and motifs due to the vast sequence sampling required to access longer elements. Here, we develop an integrated approach that calculates global pairwise interaction scores from in vitro selection and high-throughput sequencing. We examined four RNA-binding proteins of phage, viral, and human origin. Our approach reveals regulatory motifs, discriminates between regulated and unregulated RNAs within their native genomic context, and correctly predicts the consequence of mutational events on binding activity. We design binding elements that enhance binding activity in cells and infer mutational pathways that reveal permissive versus disruptive evolutionary trajectories between regulated motifs. These docking landscapes are widely applicable for the discovery and characterization of protein-RNA recognition at single nucleotide resolution.",,"Zhou, Q.;Kunder, N.;De la Paz, J. A.;Lasley, A.

To fight the disease and protect pigs, different vaccines were developed, including the early generation of the lapinized Rovac strain and the later development of the ""Chinese"" strain (C strain). However, the details of the development of these vaccines are lost to history. To investigate the phylogenetic relationship between Rovac and other lapinized vaccines, this study determined the genome sequence of Rovac, which consisted of 12,304 nucleotides, in particular with the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) containing a 13-nucleotide insert. . The near-complete genome of the Russian vaccine strain LK-VNIVViM was determined by next-generation sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis revealed a closer relationship of the Rovac strain to the Russian strain LK-VNIVViM, CS and its derivative RUCSFPLUM (genotype 1.2), rather than to strain C (genotype 1.1). Furthermore, it demonstrated an ancestral role of LK-VNIVViM in relation to the CS strain and RUCSFPLUM.

This study reports enteric infections with porcine astrovirus type 4 (PAstV4), porcine rotavirus group A (GARV), porcine rotavirus group C (GCRV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), and porcine kobuvirus (PKoV) in 419 pigs, comprising both healthy and diarrheic animals, from 49 farms in five European countries (Austria, Germany, Hungary, Spain and Sweden). Real-time RT-PCR assays were developed to analyze fecal samples and compare prevalence and viral load in relation to health status, farms of origin, and age groups. The results showed that PAstV4 (70.4%) was the dominant viral species, followed by PKoV (56.7%), PCV2 (42.2%), GCRV (3%) and GARV (0.9%). Diarrheic pigs had a higher PAstV4 viral load in the weaner and finisher groups. Rotaviruses were mainly detected in pigs with diarrhoea, while PCV2 was detected more frequently in clinically healthy pigs than in pigs with diarrhoea, suggesting that most PCV2 infections were subclinical.

Indigenous Chinese Tongcheng (TC) pigs reportedly show strong resistance to PRRSV infection. MiRNA expression profiles of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) from control and PRRSV-infected TC pigs in vivo were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing to explore infection-induced changes.

Gene ontology analysis showed that predicted target genes for DEmiRNAs were enriched in immune response, transcriptional regulation, and cell death. Integrative analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression revealed that downregulated methylation-related genes (DNMT1 and DNMT3b) were targeted by five upregulated DEmiRNAs. Furthermore, 35 miRNA pairs (70 miRNAs) were co-expressed after PRRSV infection and six pairs were co-expressed differently.

2464,Molecular characterization of a new bat-associated circovirus with a poly-T tract in the 3â€² intergenic region,"The Circoviridae family comprises a large group of small circular single-stranded DNA viruses with several members that cause serious disease in pigs and birds. In recent years, the number of new viruses within the family has increased explosively, showing a high level of genetic diversity and a wide host range. In this report we describe two more circoviruses identified in bats in Yunnan and Heilongjiang provinces in China. Whole genome sequencing has revealed that these bat-associated circoviruses (bat ACV) should be classified as new species within the genus Circovirus according to the demarcation criteria of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The most surprising result is the novel finding of a 21-28 nt polythymidine (poly-T) tract in the 3' terminal intergenic region of bat ACV isolates from Heilongjiang province. To understand its role in viral replication, a wild-type bat ACV and a mutated version with the entire poly-T deleted were rescued by constructing infectious clones. Comparison of in vitro replication showed that poly-T is not essential for viral replication. The identification of additional isolates of ACV from bats and the study of their biological characteristics will be the main task in the future to understand the potential roles of bats in the transmission of circoviruses to terrestrial mammals and humans.",,"Zhu, A.;Jiang, T.;Hu, T.;Mi, S.;Zhao, Z.;Zhang, F.;Feng, J.;Fan, Q.;He, B.;Tu, C.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2018.04.012,0
2465,Comparative genomic analysis identifies structural features of CRISPR-Cas systems in Riemerella anatipestifer,"Background: Riemerella anatipestifer infection is a contagious disease that has resulted in great economic losses in the duck industry throughout the world. This study attempted to characterize the CRISPR-Cas systems in the disease-causing agent, Riemerella anatipestifer (R. anatipestifer). The CRISPR-Cas system provides adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements in prokaryotes, and CRISPR-cas loci exist widely in the genomes of archaea and bacteria. However, the structural features of R. anatipestifer CRISPR-Cas systems remain to be elucidated due to the limited availability of genomic data. Results: To identify the structure and components associated with CRISPR-Cas systems in R. anatipestifer, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems in 25 R. anatipestifer strains using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that most of the R. anatipestifer strains (20/25) that were analyzed have two CRISPR loci (CRISPR1 and CRISPR2). CRISPR1 was shown to be flanked on one side by cas genes, while CRISPR2 was designated as orphan. The other strains tested harbored only one locus, either CRISPR1 or CRISPR2. The length and content of the consensus direct repeat sequences, as well as the length of the spacer sequences associated with the two loci, differed from each other. Only three cas genes (cas1, cas2, and cas9) were located upstream of CRISPR1. CRISPR1 was also shown to be flanked by a 107 bp long putative leader sequence and a 16 nt long anti-repeat sequence. Combined with spacer organization similarity analysis and the phylogenetic tree of R. anatipestifer strains, CRISPR arrays can be divided into different subgroups. Diversity of spacer organization was observed in the same subgroup. In general, the organization of the spacers in CRISPR1 was more divergent than in CRISPR2. Furthermore, only 8% of the spacers (13/153) were homologous with phage or plasmid sequences. The cas operon flanking CRISPR1 was found to be relatively conserved based on multiple sequence alignments of Cas amino acid sequences. Phylogenetic analysis associated with Cas9 showed that the R. anatipestifer Cas9 sequence was closely related to that of Bacteroides fragilis and was part of the subtype II-C subgroup. Conclusions: Our data revealed for the first time the structural features of the R. anatipestifer CRISPR-Cas systems. Illumination of the structural features of the CRISPR-Cas system can help study the specific mechanism associated with CRISPR-mediated adaptive immunity and other biological functions in R. anatipestifer.",,"Zhu, D.

2467,Origins and evolutionary dynamics of the H3N2 canine influenza virus,"UNLABELED: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are primarily maintained in wild birds, and despite frequent indirect infections of avian IAVs in mammals, only a small number of viruses have become established in mammalian hosts. A novel H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) of avian origin emerged in Asia in the mid-2000s and is now circulating in dog populations in China and South Korea, and possibly in Thailand. The emergence of CIV provides new opportunities for zoonotic infections and interspecies transmission. We examined 14,764 complete IAV genomes along with all publicly available CIV genomes from their first isolation to 2013. We show that CIV may have originated as early as 1999 as a result of segmental rearrangement between Eurasian and North American avian IAV lineages. . We also identified amino acid changes that might have played a role in the appearance of CIVs, some of which had not previously been identified in other species gaps. CIV evolves at a slower rate than H3N2 human influenza viruses, and viral phylogenies exhibit a geographic structure consistent with high levels of local transmission. We detected multiple intrasubtypic and heterosubtypic rearrangement events, including acquisition of the NS segment from a previously missed H5N1 avian influenza virus. In summary, our results provide insight into the adaptive changes required by avian viruses to establish themselves in mammals and also highlight the potential role of dogs to act as intermediate hosts from which viruses with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential could originate, particularly with an estimated dog population of ~700 million. SIGNIFICANCE: Influenza A viruses circulate in humans and animals. This multihost ecology has important implications, as previous pandemics were caused by IAVs carrying gene segments of human and animal origin. Adaptive evolution is central to interspecies leaps, which is why understanding the evolutionary processes that shape influenza A virus genomes is key to elucidating the mechanisms that underpin viral emergence. A canine influenza virus (CIV) of avian origin has recently emerged in dogs and is spreading in Asia. We reconstruct the evolutionary history of CIV and show that it originated from both Eurasian and North American avian lineages. We also identified the mutations that could have been responsible for the jump between species. Finally, we provide evidence of multiple reassortment events between CIV and other influenza viruses (including an avian H5N1 virus). This is cause for concern as there is a large dog population globally to which humans are highly exposed.",,"Zhu, H.;Hughes, J.;Murcia, P. R.",2015.0,May,,0

2469,"Molecular characterization of avian influenza viruses of subtypes H3N2 and H4N6 isolated from mallard ducks in Poyang Lake, China in 2010","Poyang Lake is the largest inland freshwater lake in China and contains many species of wild birds and waterfowl. We conducted a survey of avian influenza viruses in nine semi-artificial waterfowl farms in Poyang Lake between January and March 2010. From 1036 cloacal swabs collected, three H3N2 and one H4N6 influenza virus were isolated from healthy wild ducks. All isolates were genetically and phylogenetically characterized. Analysis of putative HA cleavage sites showed that all four isolates possessed the molecular characteristics (QTRGL for H3N2 viruses, PEKASR for H4N6 viruses) of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral genomes showed that all four virus isolates clustered in the Eurasian clade of influenza viruses. The M gene of the viruses possessed the highest homology to highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses. In addition, coinfection of H3N2 and H4N6 was observed on the same farm. And interestingly, we isolated two virus subtypes (H3N2 and H4N6) and their virus progeny (H3N2) with evidence of genome rearrangement from the same farm, in which H4N6 PB1 and PB2 gene segments replaced those of strain H3N2. The results of the animal infection experiments showed that the four isolated viruses were low pathogenic for chickens and non-pathogenic for mice, which was consistent with the results of the genetic analysis.",,"Zhu, N.;Zhao, J.

2470,Phylogenetic and pathogenic analysis of Newcastle disease virus isolated from the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) living around a poultry farm in southern China,"The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is one of the most widely distributed wild birds in China. Five strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) were isolated from house sparrows living in poultry farms in southern China. These isolates were characterized by pathogenic assays and phylogenetic analysis. The results showed that all NDV isolates except one were velogenic and virulent for chickens. These four chicken-virulent strains possess the amino acid sequence 112R/KRQK/RR-F117 at the F0 cleavage site that is typical of velogenic NDV. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these isolates belong to genotype VII and were closely related to strains that were isolated from NDV outbreaks in chickens since 2000. /LaSota/46). The result of this study showed that the house sparrow can carry the virulent strains of NDV and that the same virus genotype circulating in poultry exists in house sparrows living in poultry farms in southern China. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.",,"Zhu, W.;Dong, J.;Xie, Z.;Liu, Q.;Khan, M.

2472,First detection of foot-and-mouth disease virus O/ME-SA/Ind2001 in China,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in China and is predominantly due to foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype O Mya-98 lineage. In recent years, the FMD virus lineage O/ME-SA/Ind2001 has spread from the Indian subcontinent to South-East Asia, the Middle East and Africa, posing a potential threat to future trans-regional movements of livestock. . In this study, we identified the occurrence of FMDV O/ME-SA/Ind2001 in China; the first time this virus lineage has been found there. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of VP1 sequences revealed that this newly identified strain belongs to the dO/ME-SA/Ind2001 sublineage and is closely related to strains that have caused recent FMD outbreaks in Nepal, Myanmar, Russia and South Korea. The results suggest widespread movements of O/ME-SA/Ind2001 viruses of the current d sublineage and provide essential information for an effective national FMD virus control program in China.",,"Zhu, Z.;Yang, F.;He, J.;Li, J.;Cao, W.;Li, J.;Xia, Y.;Guo, J.;Jin, Y.;Zhang, K.;Zheng, H.;Liu, X.",2018.0,,10.1111/tbed.12895,0
2473,Selected microRNA-192 mutant indicates association with several functional genes in bovine cells,"MicroRNAs are involved in many cellular processes, such as cell differentiation and development, tumorigenesis, and immune regulation. In this study, miR192 was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) when MDBK cells were challenged with Escherichia coli. bta-miR-192 malfunctioning cells were established using transcriptional activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology. Finally, bta-miR-192 mutant cells were screened for differentially expressed genes by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The results showed that miR192 was significantly decreased in cells exposed to E. coli F18ac and E. coli K88ac. RNA-seq results showed that 1673 differentially expressed transcripts were identified; 890 genes were upregulated and 775 genes were downregulated. With gene ontology enrichment analysis, 431 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were classified into 937 gene ontology terms. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that 535 genes were involved in 254 pathway terms. Interestingly, most of these DEGs were associated with pathways in cancers or infectious diseases. When selected DEGs (n = 162) in these pathways were crossed with 120 differential transcripts, 11 DEGs were identified. Subsequently, several genes associated with regulation, cancer, or viral infections, such as LEF1, AXIN2, MX1, and FCGR2B, were identified among DEGs by functional analysis. Furthermore, associations between bta-miR-192 and DEG were detected by crossing bta-miR-192 target genes with DEGs, indicating that three genes, including CBL, DICER1, and TRERF1, were involved in this relationship. These findings provided a useful guide to investigate the role that bta-miR-192 plays in cellular functionality in bovine cells.",,"Zi, C.;Zeng, D.;Zhou, J.;Dai, J.;Jiang, L.;Xue, F.;Jiang, Y.;Li, B.",2018.0,,10.1007/s13258-017-0635-3,0
2474,Evidence for a third independent introduction of Usutu virus into Germany,"Usutu virus (USUV) is an arbovirus of the flavivirus genus, which was first introduced in southern Europe approximately twenty years ago and caused epizootics among wild and captive birds. In Germany, USUV was initially discovered in wild birds, mainly blackbirds (Turdus merula), in the Upper Rhine Valley in the south-west of the country in 2011 and has not spread much north since then. Phylogenetic analyzes revealed that the ongoing USUV epidemic is caused by two different USUV strains, USUV-Germany belonging to the USUV Europe 3 lineage and USUV-Bonn belonging to the USUV Africa 3 lineage. The two strains were introduced independently. In August 2015, a new strain of USUV, named USUV-Berlin, was isolated in Vero cells from two carcasses of young gray owls (Strix nebulosa) kept at the Berlin Zoological Garden, which had suffered a fatal peracute systemic infection. Both owls carried high loads of the USUV genome. Complete sequences of the USUV genomes were determined and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a close relationship with a sequence derived from a Spanish mosquito from 2006. Immunohistochemical detection of antigens in organ samples from the owls showed typical patterns of USUV infection. Based on phylogenetic analysis, USUV-Berlin belongs to the Africa 2 lineage and can therefore be distinguished from the other strains circulating in Germany. Repeated findings of different USUV strains suggest more frequent introductions into Central Europe and higher mobility of this virus than previously assumed.",,"Ziegler, U.;Fast, C.;Eiden, M.;Bock, S.;Schulze, C.;Hoeper, D.;Ochs, A.;Schlieben, P.;Keller, M.;Zielke, D.

The aim of this work was to determine the sequences of the nucleoprotein (N) gene and to genetically characterize the rabies virus isolates in order to know which virus group (biotype) circulates in the reservoir species in Lithuania. The nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences of classical rabies virus isolate from different parts of Lithuania were found to be closely related to each other and demonstrated 97.7-100% nucleotide identity and could be placed in a lineage. with 100% boot support. The 12 rabies virus sequences from raccoon dogs, red foxes, dogs, and martens exhibited 97.7-99.0% identity with previously published sequences from eastern parts of Poland, Estonia, Finland, and the northeastern part of Finland.

2476,Genetic analysis revealed that genotype LX4 strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus became predominant in recent years in the Sichuan area of China.,"Between 2008 and 2010, 19 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains were isolated from vaccinated chicken flocks in Sichuan province, China. The S1 genes of the isolates were amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 19 isolates and 37 reference IBV strains can be grouped into eight genotypes. Although Taiwan-I type, Massachusetts type, and proventriculitis type IBVs were isolated, most isolates were of the LX4 genotype. Homology analysis of the S1 gene sequences of the 19 isolates and 37 reference IBV strains revealed that the identity of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the S1 genes between the 15 LX4-like isolates and other IBV strains it was 71.9-99.3% and 72.1%. -99.1%, respectively, while those of the LX4-type IBV analyzed were 96.0-99.9% and 94.3-99.8%, respectively.

2477,Molecular characterization and receptor binding specificity of H9N2 avian influenza viruses based on environmental surveillance related to poultry in China between 2013 and 2016,"Avian influenza viruses (AIV) H9N2 have become panzootic and have caused sporadic cases in humans since 1998. Based on environmental surveillance data related to poultry in mainland China from 2013 to 2016, a total of 68 representative environmental isolates and systematic investigation continued. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Y280-like H9N2 viruses have been predominant during 2013-2016 and acquired multiple specific amino acid substitutions that could favor viral transmission from birds to mammals. In addition, viruses have undergone dramatic evolution and rearrangement, resulting in greater genetic diversity or acting as genetic contributors to new avian viruses. Receptor binding tests indicated that most H9N2 isolates bound to the human-like receptor, allowing them to easily cross the species barrier and efficiently infect humans. Our results suggested that H9N2 AIVs prevalent in poultry may pose a serious threat to public health.",,"Zou, S.;Zhang, Y.;Li, X.;Bo, H.;Wei, H.;Dong, L.;Yang, L.;Dong, J.;Liu, J.;Shu, Y.;Wang, D.",2019.0,,10.1016/j.virol.2019.01.002,0
2478,Information on the increasing virulence of the pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza virus of swine origin,"Pandemic H1N1/2009 viruses have stabilized in pig herds, and some strains show higher pathogenicity than human isolates. In this study, high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is applied to explore systemic transcriptome responses from mouse lungs infected with porcine (Jia6/10) and human (LN/09) H1N1/2009 viruses. . The transcriptome data shows that Jia6/10 activates stronger virus-sensing signals, such as toll-like receptor, RIG-I-like receptor, and NOD-like receptor signals, as well as stronger NF-κB and JAK- STAT, which play an important role in the induction of innate immunity. Most of the genes stimulated by cytokines and interferon show a higher expression lever in the Jia/06 infected groups. Meanwhile, Jia6/10 virus activates a higher production of reactive oxygen species, which could promote a higher mutation rate of the virus genome. Taken together, our data reveal that pandemic H1N1/2009 virus of swine origin elicits a stronger innate immune response and stimulation of pro-oxidation, which could be closely related to increased pathogenicity.",,"Zou, W.;Chen, D.;Xiong, M.;Zhu, J.;Lin, X.;Wang, L.;Zhang, J.;Chen, L.;Zhang, H.;Chen, H.;Chen, M.;Jin, M.",2013.0,,,0
2479,Genetic analysis of ancient Hungarian avian influenza viruses,"Certain genes from 13 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) isolated in the 1970s were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The viruses originated in the eastern part of Hungary from ducks and guinea fowl with relatively severe respiratory signs. In addition to the hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes (H4, H5, H6, H7, and H10) previously identified by serology, neuraminidase (NA) subtypes have been identified by genetic analysis (Table). Based on the amino acid pattern at the HA proteolytic cleavage site, all H5 and H7 strains were found to belong to the low pathogenicity (LP) category. The phylogenetic analysis of the HA, NA and NS genes allowed the following epidemiological conclusions to be drawn. (1) All Hungarian strains belonged to the Eurasian lineage of AIV. (2) The H5 strains were members of an ancient European group (Figure 1). The H4 strains (Figure 2) originated from three different sources (two from the Far East and one from Europe). (3) The fact that most of the viruses in the H4 and H5 subtypes were reassortant (some even multiple; Figure 3) suggested that their reservoirs were unlikely to be wild waterfowl, but domestic ducks. Further studies of ancient viruses would be necessary for a more detailed understanding of the role of these ""artificial"" reservoirs in the maintenance and epidemiology of AIV.",,"Zsofia, S.;Sandor, K.;Istvan, K.;Bela, L.",2008.0,Mar,,0
2480,Molecular epidemiology of rabies: focus on domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) from northern South Africa,"The phylogenetic relationships of rabies viruses recovered from black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) and domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) in northern South Africa were investigated to determine whether the black-backed jackal is an emerging maintenance host species for rabies. rage in this region. A panel of 123 rabies viruses obtained from the two host species between 1980 and 2006 was characterized by nucleotide sequencing of the cytoplasmic domain of the glycoprotein gene and the non-coding GL intergenic region. Through phylogenetic analysis, a viral group specific to black-backed jackals and spanning a 5-year period in western Limpopo was delineated. Strains of the virus associated with domestic dogs are prevalent in densely populated communal areas in northeastern Limpopo and southern and eastern Mpumalanga. The data presented in this study indicated the likelihood that black-backed jackals are capable of withstanding cycles of rabies independently of domestic dogs. It is proposed that wildlife rabies control strategies, in synergy with vaccination of domestic animals, be considered for effective rabies control in South Africa. © 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Zulu, G.

2481,Novel picornavirus associated with avian keratin disorder in Alaskan birds,"UNLABELED: Avian Keratin Disorder (AKD), characterized by debilitating overgrowth of the avian beak, was first documented in Black-headed Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) in Alaska. Similar deformities have subsequently appeared in numerous species on all continents. Despite the wide distribution of this emerging pathology, the cause of AKD remains elusive. As a result, it is unknown whether suspected cases of AKD in affected species are causally related, and the impacts of AKD at the population and community levels are difficult to assess. We apply unbiased next-generation metagenomic sequencing to search for candidate pathogens in AKD-affected birds. We identified and sequenced the entire coding region of a new picornavirus, which we named poecivirus. Further examination of 19 AKD-affected Black-headed Chickadees and 9 control individuals for the presence of poecivirus revealed that 19/19 (100%) of the AKD-affected individuals tested positive, while only 2/9 (22%). ) from control individuals were infected with poecivirus. Two northwestern ravens (Corvus caurinus) and two red-breasted nuthatches (Sitta canadensis) with pathology consistent with AKD also tested positive for poecivirus. We suggest that poecivirus is a candidate etiologic agent of AKD. IMPORTANCE: Avian Keratin Disorder (AKD) is an increasingly common disease of wild birds. This disease, characterized by excessive beak growth, was first described in the late 1990s and has spread rapidly both geographically and in terms of affected host species. AKD decreases host fitness and can be fatal. However, the cause of the disease has remained elusive, and its impact on host populations is poorly understood. We found a new and divergent picornavirus in 19/19 AKD-affected black-headed chickadees that we examined, but only in 2/9 control cases. We also found this virus in 4 individuals of 2 other passerine species that had symptoms consistent with AKD. Our data suggest that this new picornavirus warrants further investigation as the causative agent of AKD.",,"Zylberberg, M.;Van Hemert, C.;Dumbacher, J. P.;Handel, C. M.;Tihan, T.;DeRisi, J.
