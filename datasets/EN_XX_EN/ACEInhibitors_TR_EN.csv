1,10024335,Pronounced and combined vascular effects of ACE blockade and HMG-CoA reductase inhibition in hypertensive subjects.,,"Nazzaro, P; Manzari, M; Merlo, M; Triggiani, R; Scarano, A; Ciancio, L; Pirrelli, A","Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are often associated with high sympathetic activity. Both are independent cardiovascular risk factors and both affect endothelium-mediated vasodilation. We studied 30 hypercholesterolemic hypertensive subjects to determine the effects of cholesterol-lowering and antihypertensive treatments on vascular reactivity and vasodilative capacity. They took placebo for 4 weeks, enalapril or simvastatin for 14 weeks, and finally both drugs for an additional 14 weeks. Postischemic forearm blood flow (MFBF) and minimal vascular resistance (mFVR) were used as indicators of vasodilative capacity and structural vascular damage, respectively. Total (rest-stress-recovery phases) cardiovascular (blood pressure [BP] and heart rate [HR]) and regional hemodynamic (FBF and FVR) reactivity to stressful stimuli were calculated as area under the curve (auc) (valuextime). ). Compared to baseline levels, simvastatin reduced total (TOT-C) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) (1.27 mmol/L, P<0.001 and 1.33 mmol/L, P<0.001, respectively). Enalapril also decreased TOT-C and LDL-C (0.6 mmol/L, P<0.001 and 0.58 mmol/L, P<0.05, respectively). MFBF increased significantly with both treatments (P<0.001). Enalapril had a greater effect on mFVR than simvastatin (-0.6 AU, P<0.05) (-1.7 arbitrary units (AU), P<0.001). During stress, FBF increased more with enalapril (4.4 FBFxmin, P<0.001) compared to simvastatin (1.8 FBFxmin, P<0.01). Conversely, the FVR stress response was more reduced with enalapril (9.1 FVRxmin, P<0.001) than simvastatin (2.9 FVRxmin, P<0.01). A significant (0.001>P<0.05) additive effect on hypercholesterolemia, structural vascular damage, BP and FVR was demonstrated during combination therapy. The findings show that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition causes a greater reduction in vascular reactivity and structural damage in hypercholesterolemic hypertensive subjects than HMG-CoA reductase blockade.",0,0
2,10027665,Computerized surveillance of adverse drug reactions in the hospital: practice.,,"Levy, M; Azaz-Livshits, T; Sadan, B; Shalit, M; Geisslinger, G; Brune, K","Implementing and measuring the effects of automated computerized laboratory signals (ALS) as a detection support tool for in-hospital adverse drug reactions (ADRs); This was a prospective observational study of a total of 192 patients (199 consecutive medical admissions) over a 2-month period in a 34-bed medical ward at Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel. The study included the routine (daily) distribution to staff physicians of automated lists of signals generated from computerized laboratory data as potential indicators of ADRs. Patient charts for ADRs were reviewed by the clinical pharmacology team to see if they were recognized by staff physicians; 71 ADRs were detected in 64 of 199 (32%) applications. Twenty-seven percent of ADRs were serious, 9% of admissions were due to ADRs. Two hundred and ninety-five ALS were generated, comprising 69% of admissions. Sixty-one percent of ADRs were identified by ALS. ALS was present in 58% of ADR negative admissions. Eighty-five percent of ADRs were recognized as such, and 19% of ALS-positive ADRs were not recognized by staff physicians. Routine implementation of ALS has doubled the number of ADRs recognized by doctors when patients are admitted to the medical ward. The system seemed valid, simple and potentially cost-effective to use.",0,0

It remains to be documented whether similar glomerular functional changes develop in proteinuric patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and whether antihypertensive agents favorably affect glomerular filtration of macromolecules in these patients; We investigated the renal hemodynamics and fractional clearance of graded sizes of neutral dextrans in nine proteinuric patients with NIDDM and renal biopsy findings of typical diabetic glomerulopathy. Six healthy volunteers served as controls. We also investigated the effects of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker on glomerular hemodynamics and elimination function, both given at doses aimed at achieving a comparable level of systemic blood pressure control. Theoretical analysis of glomerular macromolecule transport is adopted to evaluate intrinsic glomerular membrane permeability properties; The fractional clearance of large macromolecules (42 to 66 Å in radius) was significantly higher in diabetic patients than in controls, and the distribution of membrane pore radii was calculated to shift towards larger pore sizes in diabetics (mean radius increased from 55 to 60 Å). Despite effective blood pressure control, none of the antihypertensives significantly affected glomerular hemodynamics. Fractional clearance of dextrans, as well as albumin and IgG, and total urine proteins were not altered by either treatment; These data demonstrate that patients with NIDDM and overt nephropathy develop abnormalities in the size-selective function of the glomerular barrier and, unlike IDDM, these changes are not ameliorated by either ACE inhibition or calcium channel blockade.",0,0
4,10028936,Total arterial compliance in ambulatory hypertension during selective beta1-adrenergic receptor blockade and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.,,"Soma, J; Aakhus, S; Dahl, K; WiderÃ¸e, T E; Skjaerpe, T","Estimates of aortic root flow and pressure were obtained noninvasively by Doppler echocardiography and calibrated subclavian artery pulse monitoring in 30 subjects with ambulatory hypertension in a randomized crossover study consisting of 4-week treatment and washout periods. Total arterial compliance, assessed using the three-element Windkessel model of the arterial tree, increased by 42% with atenolol (50-100 mg once daily) and 7% (p = NS) with captopril (25-50 mg twice daily). Atenolol decreased mean arterial pressure by 15%, heart rate by 22%, and cardiac output by 14%, and increased aortic root flow acceleration time by 17% and stroke volume and ejection time by 11%. Captopril reduced mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance by 7%. Acceleration time of aortic root flow, ejection time, heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output were not significantly changed with captopril. We conclude that total arterial compliance in operational blood pressure is increased during selective beta1-adrenergic receptor blockade in patients with ambulatory hypertension. While the main mechanism is a reduction in mean arterial pressure, it should be considered whether decreased heart rate plays an additional role. The nonsignificant increase in total arterial compliance during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may be mainly a result of moderate reduction in mean arterial pressure.",0,0
5,10029645,Racial differences in outcome of left ventricular dysfunction.,,"Dries, D L; Exner, D V; Gersh, B J; Cooper, H A; Carson, P E; Domanski, M J","Population-based studies have found that black patients with congestive heart failure have a higher mortality rate than whites with the same condition. This finding was attributed to differences in the severity, causes, and management of heart failure, the prevalence of coexisting conditions, and socioeconomic factors. Although these factors probably explain some of the higher death rates from congestive heart failure among blacks, we hypothesized that racial differences in the natural history of left ventricular dysfunction may also play a role; We conducted a retrospective analysis of the outcomes of asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction among black and white participants, using data from the Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) prevention and treatment studies, in which all patients received standard treatment and follow-up. . The mean (+/-SD) follow-up time among black and white participants was 34.2+/-14.0 months in the prevention trial and 32.3+/-14.8 months in the treatment trial; Overall mortality rates in the prevention trial were 8.1 per 100 person-years for blacks and 5.1 per 100 person-years for whites. In the treatment trial, the rates were 16.7 per 100 person-years and 13.4 per 100 person-years, respectively. After adjusting for age, co-existing conditions, severity and causes of heart failure, and medication use, blacks had a higher risk of death from all causes in both SOLVD prevention studies (relative risk, 1.36; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.74). ; P=0.02) and treatment trial (relative risk, 1.25; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.50; P=0.02). In both studies, blacks were at higher risk for death from pump failure and the combined endpoint of death from any cause or hospitalization for heart failure, our two predefined indicators of progression of left ventricular systolic dysfunction; Blacks with mild to moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction appear to be at higher risk of heart failure and death from any cause than similarly treated whites. These results suggest that there may be racial differences in the outcome of asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction.",1,0
6,10029788,exfoliative dermatitis.,,"Karakayli, G; Beckham, G; Orengo, I; Rosen, T","Exfoliative dermatitis, also known as erythroderma, is a rare but serious skin condition that family physicians should recognize and treat appropriately. Although its etiology is often unknown, exfoliative dermatitis may be the result of a drug reaction or an underlying malignancy. The approach to treatment should include discontinuation of potentially causative drugs and investigation of any underlying malignancy. One of the most common malignancies associated with exfoliative dermatitis is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which may not appear months or even years after the onset of the skin condition. Hospitalization is usually required for initial evaluation and treatment. Special attention should be paid to the provision of temperature control in the hospital, the replacement of lost fluids and electrolytes, and the prevention and treatment of infection. The long-term prognosis is good for patients with drug-induced disease, although the course tends to remit and relapse in idiopathic cases. The prognosis of malignancy-related cases typically depends on the outcome of the underlying malignancy.",0,0

The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) is a randomized intervention trial to compare the effects of ACE inhibition and conventional therapy on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension; CAPPP was a prospective, randomized, open trial with blinded endpoint assessment. 10,985 patients were enrolled in 536 health centers in Sweden and Finland. Patients aged 25-66 years with a measured diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or more twice were randomly assigned to captopril or conventional antihypertensive therapy (diuretics, beta-blockers). The analysis was therapeutic. The primary endpoint was a composite of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular deaths; Of the 5492 patients given captopril and the 5493 patients given conventional therapy, 14 and 13, respectively, dropped out of follow-up. The primary endpoint events occurred in 363 patients (11.1 per 1000 patient-years) in the captopril group and in 335 patients (10.2 per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.05 [95% CI 0.90-1.22], p=0) in the conventional therapy group. -52). Cardiovascular mortality was lower with captopril than with conventional therapy (76 versus 95 events; relative risk 0.77 [0.57-1-04], p=0.092), fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction rate was similar (162 versus 161), however, fatal and non-fatal stroke was more common with captopril (189 vs. 148; 1.25 [1-01-1-55].p=0.044); Captopril and conventional therapy did not differ in efficacy in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The difference in stroke risk is likely due to the lower blood pressure levels achieved at baseline in pretreated patients randomized to conventional therapy.",0,0
8,10047639,Effects of short-acting and long-acting loop diuretics on heart rate variability in patients with chronic compensated congestive heart failure.,,"Tomiyama, H; Nakayama, T; Watanabe, G; Shiojima, K; Sakuma, Y; Yamamoto, A; Imai, Y; Yoshida, H; Doba, N","We investigated the effects of a short-acting loop diuretic (furosemide) and a long-acting loop diuretic (azosemide) on heart rate variability, fluid balance, and neurohormonal responses in patients with mild to moderate chronic congestive heart failure; 19 patients with mild to moderate chronic congestive heart failure received furosemide (40 to 60 mg/day) or azosemide (60 to 90 mg/day) crosswise for 5 days. We performed time-domain and frequency-domain analyzes of 24-hour Holter electrocardiographic recordings to assess heart rate variability; 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was similar during the furosemide and azosemide treatment periods but was significantly higher during the first 2 hours after drug administration during furosemide treatment. Only 2 hours after furosemide administration, plasma renin activity and hematocrit level increased and high frequency power was significantly reduced. The standard deviation of all normal RR intervals and the mean square root of consecutive differences in the RR interval were lower with furosemide than with azosemide (P < .05). Furosemide, a short-acting loop diuretic, has a greater effect on heart rate variability and fluid balance in patients with mild to moderate chronic congestive heart failure than azosemide, a long-acting loop diuretic.",0,0

Combined angiotensin II type I (AT1) receptor blockade and ACE inhibition suppress the activated renin-angiotensin system more completely than intervention alone in normal sodium-deficient individuals. It is unknown whether AT1 receptor blockade with losartan improves exercise capacity in patients with severe CHF currently treated with ACE inhibitors; In a multicenter, double-blind study, 33 patients with severe CHF despite treatment with the maximum recommended or tolerated doses of ACE inhibitors were randomized 1:1 to receive losartan 50 mg/day or placebo for 6 months in addition to standard therapy. Peak aerobic capacity (V(O2)) during symptom-limited treadmill exercise and NYHA functional class was determined at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of double-blind treatment.

Both studies had similar designs and included all three active treatments. The second study also included a placebo group. Subjects (n = 541) with a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 95-114 mmHg were titrated to a diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mmHg. Studies included 114 blacks and 427 non-blacks. Results of an intent-to-treat analysis of mean change from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment showed: 1) blood pressure was significantly lowered by all three active drugs compared to baseline or placebo; 2) in blacks, bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ caused significantly greater reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than enalapril or placebo, but not significantly different from amlodipine; 3) in non-blacks, bisoprolol/6.25 mg of HCTZ resulted in significantly greater reductions in diastolic blood pressure than amlodipine, enalapril, or placebo. The placebo-adjusted change in blood pressure was greater for blacks than for whites in the bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ combination, but this was not statistically significant. Bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ controlled diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mmHg in blacks and non-blacks in significantly more patients than enalapril or placebo. The difference in control rates was not significant against amlodipine.

13,10066961,Linear IgA bullous dermatosis in a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia: possible involvement of granulocyte colony stimulating factor.,,"Kano, Y; Kokaji, T; Shiohara, T","We describe a case of linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) in a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia during treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). After the drug rash due to imipenem cilastatin sodium disappeared, bullous lesions appeared on the trunk. Histopathological studies of the lesion and direct immunofluorescence studies were consistent with LABD. However, re-establishment of G-CSF after resolution did not reproduce the bullous eruptions. This suggests that, in addition to G-CSF, the presence of precipitating factors that can synergistically increase or accelerate disease onset is required for the development of bullous lesions. Various cytokines endogenously produced from lymphocytes activated during drug eruption, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), may have provided a favorable environment for the initiation of G-CSF-induced LABD. We suggest that patients with LABD should be given special care with respect to the type or combination of cytokines administered as therapeutic modalities.",0,0

Telmisartan dose was increased from 20 to 40-80 mg and enalapril dose was increased from 5 to 10-20 mg at 4-week intervals until supine diastolic blood pressure was <90 mmHg. After 12 weeks, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-25 mg once daily was added to the treatment regimen for patients not controlled with monotherapy. Both treatments lowered blood pressure in a comparable and clinically significant way. Adjusted mean changes from baseline in supine diastolic blood pressure in the chute were -12.8 mmHg for telmisartan and -11.4 mmHg for enalapril (P = 0.074). Mean changes in supine systolic blood pressure were -22.1 mmHg for telmisartan and -20.1 mmHg for enalapril (P = 0.350). Overall, 63% and 62% of patients with supine diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg responded to telmisartan and enalapril, respectively. Both regimens provided effective blood pressure reduction throughout the 24-hour dosing interval, as determined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Both regimens were well tolerated; however, the incidence of treatment-related cough was more than doubled in patients on the enalapril regimen compared with those on the telmisartan regimen (6.5% versus 16%); These results indicate that telmisartan is well tolerated and is at least as effective as enalapril in the treatment of elderly patients with mild to moderate hypertension.",0,0

We conducted a double-blind study in 25 patients with exercise-induced ischemia. The effects of perindoprilat on pacing-induced myocardial ischemia were examined. Fourteen patients received perindoprilat and 11 patients received placebo. Based on LV function, 2 subgroups were created in the perindoprilat group: 7 patients with LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction <0.40) and 7 patients with normal LV function. After receiving study drug, the pacing test was repeated. Ischemia developed in both groups during the first pacing test. The increase in systemic vascular resistance and LV end-diastolic pressure was significantly blunted after perindopril administration (p < 0.05). Also, the ischemia-induced increase in arterial and cardiac uptake of norepinephrine was inhibited by perindoprilat and the increase in atrial natriuretic peptide was less pronounced; furthermore, ST-segment depression was reduced by 32% compared to placebo (all p < 0.05). In the group with LV dysfunction, perindoprilat significantly reduced LV end-diastolic pressure by 67% and myocardial lactate production was inhibited, but not in the group with normal LV function. In addition, the increase in arterial norepinephrine was decreased by 74% and 33%, respectively (p <0.05). These results demonstrate that perindoprilat reduces acute, pacing-induced ischemia in normotensive patients. In patients with (asymptomatic) LV dysfunction, these effects were more pronounced than in patients with normal LV function.",0,0

This study compares reports of cough with losartan and three ACEIs used in general practice; Studies were conducted using the Prescription Event Monitoring technique for losartan and the three ACEIs enalapril, lisinopril and perindopril. Patients were identified using prescribed prescription data. Questionnaires were sent to the general practitioners of the patients 6 months after the first prescription date. Cases of cough resulting in drug discontinuation within the first 60 days of losartan treatment were followed up with additional questionnaires. Incidence rates were calculated for cough reports. To mitigate the effect of transference effects, odds ratios were calculated for initial cough reports between days 8 and 60 using losartan as the index drug; The cohort for each drug exceeded 9000 patients. Age and gender distributions and indications for prescribing the four drugs were similar. Cough was the most common reason for discontinuation of losartan therapy and the most frequently reported event during the first month of therapy with this drug. 1-7. Cough rates were significantly higher for the three ACEIs (rate ratios 1.5, 4.8, and 5.7, all P<0.03), compared with losartan, excluding reports of cough between days and days. 101 patients discontinued losartan due to cough. Of these, 91% were previously prescribed an ACEI and 86% had a previous ACEI cough; Transmission was responsible for the excess of reports of cough with losartan. Cough rates between days 8 and 60 were significantly higher for the three ACEIs compared with losartan. Confusing factors associated with comparative observational cohort studies are discussed.",0,0

Whether they also benefit patients with coronary artery disease in the absence of congestive heart failure through an antiatherosclerotic mechanism is a question the QUinapril Ischemic Event Trial quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) study seeks to answer: 1750 patients with normal left ventricular function: patients undergoing coronary angiography and angioplasty, receiving placebo versus quinapril 20 mg/day and followed for 3 years for cardiac endpoints. A randomly selected subset of the total cohort underwent follow-up angiography. The primary QCA endpoint was the categorical definition of progression versus no progression defined by QCA or a cardiac event in patients selected for the QCA trial with no follow-up x-rays available. Secondary endpoints in patients with 2 angiograms: development of new stenosis, change in minimum luminal diameter index, and change in percent diameter stenosis index.

Selective, angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonism with losartan, which inhibits the effects of angiotensin II independently of its source at the receptor level, may result in more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. The Optimal Treatment of Myocardial Infarction (OPTIMAAL) study with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel, captopril-controlled study. The primary hypothesis is that, compared with captopril, losartan will reduce the risk of all-cause death by 20% in high-risk patients after acute myocardial infarction. The study population will consist of 5,000 patients > or = 50 years of age with heart failure or a recent Q-wave anterior infarction or reinfarction during the acute phase. Patients will be randomized to treatment with losartan or captopril. All patients will be followed (event-driven) until 937 deaths occur. The primary endpoint was total mortality (all-cause mortality). Secondary and tertiary endpoints were sudden death (and/or resuscitated cardiac death) and fatal/non-fatal re-infarction. Based on a 95% power (2-sided, adjusted for 2 interim analyzes) to detect a default event rate, treatment effect, and a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality at the 4.3% significance level, the trial will generate at least 5,004 records . in patients and until the total number of events is reached (intended-to-treat analysis).",1,0
20,10075143,Study on propionyl-L-carnitine in chronic heart failure.,,,"Fatigue in patients with chronic heart failure is independent of hemodynamic and neuroendocrine changes and may possibly be due to impaired muscle metabolism. Propionyl-L-carnitine, a carnitine derivative, has been shown in previous studies to improve muscle metabolism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of propionyl-L-carnitine on exercise capacity in patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure treated with ACE inhibitors and diuretics. This was a phase III, double-blind, randomized, parallel, multicenter study. The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of propionyl-L-carnitine on maximal exercise time versus placebo using a cycling exercise test. The primary analysis performed in the intent-to-treat population (271 vs 266 patients on propionyl-L-carnitine and placebo) showed no statistically significant difference between treatments. A 15 s difference in favor of propionyl-L-carnitine was observed in the complementary/matched population (P=0.092). A prespecified subgroup analysis of patients classified by baseline maximum exercise time showed an improvement trend in propionyl-L-carnitine patients with shorter maximum exercise time. A previously unspecified analysis in patients classified by ejection fraction (< or = 30% vs. 30-40%) showed a statistically significant difference in maximum exercise time favoring propionyl-L-carnitine in patients with higher ejection fraction (40 sec, P <0.01). There were no security issues.; The study does not meet the primary objective, but confirms the good safety profile of propionyl-L-carnitine. An unspecified exploratory analysis shows that propionyl-L-carnitine improves exercise capacity in patients with preserved heart function. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed by a specially adapted study.",0,0

Bcl-2 concentrations were higher in hypertensives than in normotensive subjects. The increase in pressure due to the cold press test resulted in greater increases in blood bcl-2 concentrations in both hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Treatment of hypertensive patients with hypotensive drugs resulted in a decrease in bcl-2 concentrations after administration of lisinopril, which was more pronounced than with nifedipine. The results show that bcl-2 concentrations are increased in patients with hypertension, which may be an important factor in cell proliferation underlying posthypertensive vascular remodeling. Furthermore, lisinopril and nifedipine appear to have the ability to reduce bcl-2 concentrations in patients with hypertension, with potentially beneficial effects on vascular modifications.",0,0
22,10077374,Tolerance to ACE inhibitors after cardiac surgery.,,"ManchÃ©, A; Galea, J; Busuttil, W","Several studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors provide significant mortality and morbidity benefits in heart failure. First dose hypotension may require discontinuation of such therapy. This is more likely if the ACE inhibitor is administered early after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The aim of this study was to analyze the hemodynamic tolerance to early postoperative treatment with perindopril and enalapril in patients with renal and ventricular dysfunction. 81 consecutive CABG patients with prior myocardial infarction, impaired preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on ventriculography, and moderately impaired renal function (serum creatinine 115-150 micromol/l) were randomized into three groups to receive oral placebo, perindopril ( 4 mg) or enalapril (5 mg) once daily. Groups were subdivided into those with mild ventricular dysfunction (LVEF = 35-65%, n = 20) and those with significant ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 35%, n = 7). Exclusion criteria included oliguria (<0.5 ml/kg per hour) at the point of entry on the first postoperative day or inotrope dependence. ACE inhibitor intolerance was defined as hypotension (<95 mmHg systolic blood pressure or decrease in systolic blood pressure exceeding 25 mmHg) leading to oliguria (<0.5 ml/kg/hr) unresponsive to intravenous furosemide (20 mg). In such cases, ACE inhibitor treatment was discontinued and dopamine was started. In groups with mild ventricular dysfunction (LVEF = 35-65%), perindopril was discontinued in 1/20 patients and enalapril in 4/20 patients (P = ns). However, in groups with significant ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 35%), perindopril was discontinued in 2/7 patients and enalapril in 7/7 patients (P = 0.02); Our results show that after CABG, patients with moderate renal dysfunction and significant ventricular dysfunction do not tolerate ACE inhibitors well when started on the first postoperative day. However, perindopril has been associated with less hemodynamic deterioration than enalapril and may consequently be advantageous in this situation. rights reserved.",0,0

24,10080414,Long-term prognostic significance of hyperkinesia following acute myocardial infarction. TRACE Working Group. TRandolapril Cardiac Evaluation.,,"KjÃ¸ller, E; KÃ¸ber, L; JÃ¸rgensen, S; Torp-Pedersen, C","The long-term prognostic significance of hyperkinesia following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is unknown. The American Society of Echocardiography recommends that hyperkinesia not be included in the wall motion index (WMI) calculation. The aim of this study was to determine whether hyperkinesia would be included in WMI when predicted for prognostic purposes after an AMI. Six thousand six hundred seventy-six consecutive patients were screened 1 to 6 days after AMI in 27 Danish hospitals. WMI was measured in 6,232 patients who applied the 9-segment model and the following scoring system: 3 for hyperkinesia, 2 for normokinesia, 1 for hypokinesia, 0 for akinesia, and -1 for dyskinesia. All patients were followed for at least 3 years for mortality. WMI was calculated in 2 different ways: 1 including hyperkinetic segments (hyperkinetic-WMI) and excluding non-hyperkinetic segments by converting hyperkinetic segments to normokinetic segments (non-hyperkinetic-WMI). Hyperkinesia occurred in 736 patients (11.8%). WMI was an important prognostic factor for long-term mortality (relative risk 2.49; p = 0.0001), with history of heart failure, hypertension, angina or diabetes, previous AMI, age, thrombolytic therapy, arrhythmias, and bundle branch block. In a multivariate analysis that included non-hyperkinetic-WMI, hyperkinesia was associated with a statistically significant relative risk of 0.84 (confidence intervals 0.74 to 0.96; p = 0.01). No additional prognostic information (relative risk 0.93; p = 0.26) was obtained when both WMI (hyperkinetic-WMI) and hyperkinesis were included as independent variable. Echocardiographic evaluation performed shortly after AMI provided important prognostic information, especially if information about hyperkinesia was included. If WMI is used for prognostic purposes, hyperkinesia should be included in the calculation of the index.",0,0

A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.,,"Domanski, M J; Exner, D V; Borkowf, C B; Geller, N L; Rosenberg, Y; Pfeffer, M A","Estimate the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) following myocardial infarction (MI); Trials in patients after MI have shown that ACE inhibitor therapy reduces mortality. However, its effect on SCD as a mechanism has not been clarified; Trials of ACE inhibitor therapy were identified after MI reported between January, 1978, and August 1997. Studies meeting the following criteria were included: 1) Randomized comparison of ACE inhibitor versus placebo within 14 days of MI; 2) run time/blind monitoring > or =6 weeks; 3) the number of deaths and patterns of death are reported or can be learned from investigators; We identified 374 candidate articles, 15 of which met the inclusion criteria. The 15 trials included 15,104 patients, 2,356 of whom died. Most of the deaths (87%) were cardiovascular and 900 were SCD. A significant reduction in the risk of SCD, or a trend towards it, was observed in all of the larger (N > 500) studies. Overall, ACE inhibitor therapy resulted in significant reductions in the risk of death (random-effects odds ratio [OR] = 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-0.97), cardiovascular death risk (OR = 0.82; 95% CI 0.69-0.97) . and SCD (OR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.70-0.92); This analysis is consistent with previous reports showing that ACE inhibitors reduce the risk of death after a recent MI by reducing cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, this analysis demonstrates that a reduction in the risk of SCD with ACE inhibitors is an important component of this survival benefit.",1,1
27,10082500,ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker for the treatment of hypertension in renal allograft recipients.,,"Hausberg, M; Barenbrock, M; Hohage, H; MÃ¼ller, S; Heidenreich, S; Rahn, K H","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to slow the progression of chronic renal failure. However, the value of ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension in renal allograft recipients has not been established. ACE inhibitors dilate the efferent glomerular arterioles, an effect that may aggravate the decrease in glomerular filtration rate caused by cyclosporine-induced vasoconstriction of the efferent glomerular arteriole. Therefore, the aim of this double-blind, randomized study was to compare the antihypertensive and renal effects of the ACE inhibitor quinapril with the beta-blocker atenolol in renal allograft recipients who developed hypertension 6 to 12 weeks after transplantation. All patients received cyclosporine as an immunosuppressant and had stable graft function (serum creatinine concentration, <220 micromol/L) at study entry. 29 patients receiving quinapril (dose titrated to 2.5 to 20 mg daily) and 30 patients receiving atenolol (a titrated daily dose of 12.5 to 100 mg) completed the 24-month study. The two groups did not differ in age, sex ratio, height and weight before entering the study. Quinapril reduced diastolic blood pressure from 96+/-1 to 84+/-1 mm Hg (mean over the treatment period), and atenolol reduced diastolic blood pressure from 96+/-1 to 83+/-1 mm Hg. dropped it. Serum creatinine concentration did not change significantly in both groups after 24 months (129+/-8 micromol/L at entry and 148+/-19 micromol/L and 131+/-6 micromole/L after 24 months in the quinapril group) at entry and atenolol group 152+/-15 micromol/L after 24 months; P=NS for both groups). After 24 months, the change from baseline in urinary albumin excretion was -10+/-15 mg/day in the quinapril group and 52+/-32 mg/day in the atenolol group (P=0.03). These results show that quinapril and atenolol are effective antihypertensive drugs when used after renal transplantation. Also, compared to atenolol, quinapril had no adverse effects on graft function. The relative reduction in albuminuria observed with quinapril compared with atenolol may indicate a beneficial effect of quinapril on long-term graft function.",0,0

Results of the RIMA (Rimodellamento Infarto Miocardico Acuto) study. RIMA researchers.,,"Coletta, C; Ricci, R; Ceci, V; Seccareccia, F; Rulli, F; Mazzuca, V; Putini, R L; Salustri, A; Bottero, G; Pasquale, M","The RIMA (Rimodellamento Infarto Miocardico Acuto) study was designed to evaluate the relative effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by captopril, beta-blocker therapy with metoprolol, and their combinations on: 1. echocardiographically detected left ventricular remodeling in patients with initial acute myocardial infarction; 2. prognosis. The second goal will be the argument of this article. Two hundred and fifty patients with acute myocardial infarction < or = 75 years consecutively (mean age: 58 years, male = 203) were randomly assigned to receive captopril (up to 75 mg/day, Group 1) for > or = 3 months, symptomatic metoprolol (up to 200 mg daily, Group 2) or captopril + metoprolol (Group 3) starting within the first 24 hours after starting. Intravenous beta-blockers and all other cardioactive drugs were allowed in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. Six months after admission to the coronary care unit, the effect of randomized treatment was evaluated regarding: 1. recurrence of spontaneous cardiac events and elective revascularization procedures; 2. Adverse reactions requiring treatment modification according to the physician's decision (hypotension, atrioventricular block, cough, allergy, need for beta-blockers in Group 1, need for ACE inhibition in Group 2); Precise follow-up data were available in 226 patients, and 195/226 patients (86%) had a full course of treatment. In these patients (based on protocol analysis), 37 spontaneous cardiac events occurred: cardiac death = 6, non-fatal re-infarction = 9, unstable angina requiring hospitalization = 16, congestive heart failure = 6. Additionally, seven patients underwent coronary revascularization procedures. Events occurred in 11/67 patients in Group 1, 16/63 patients in Group 2, and 10/65 patients in Group 3 (16% vs. 25% vs. 15%, p = 0.28). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed an increased odds ratio (OR) for spontaneous cardiac events in patients in Group 2 (OR = 2.82, 95% CI: 1.16-6.87: p < 0.05). Elective revascularization procedures were statistically less frequent in patients treated with metoprolol (Group 1 = 9%, Group 2 = 1.6%, Group 3 = 0%; Groups 1 and Groups 2 and 3; p = 0.03). In the general population (226 patients), the intent-to-treat analysis confirmed the existence of a trend towards higher risk in patients in Group 2 (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 0.96-4.59; p = 0.06). Adverse reactions were observed in 16 patients from Group 1, 6 patients from Group 2, and 15 patients from Group 3 (22% vs 10%-23%; Group 2 vs. Groups 1 and 3; p = 0.08). Multivariate regression analysis confirmed a trend for fewer adverse reactions in patients assigned to beta-blocker therapy alone (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.15-1.13; p = 0.07).; In a randomized early post-infarction treatment strategy, ACE inhibition with captopril alone or in combination with metoprolol showed increased protection against spontaneous cardiac events at six months compared to metoprolol alone. On the other hand, beta-blocker therapy was associated with fewer elective revascularization procedures and was better tolerated than ACE inhibition.",1,0

Inspection with 123I-MIBG imaging.,,"Soeki, T; Tamura, Y; Bandou, K; Tanaka, H; Takeichi, N; Shinohara, H; Yui, Y; Fukuda, N; Sui, O","To examine the long-term effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on chronic heart failure, 10 patients (7 men and 3 women, mean age: 62 +/- 11 years) with chronic stable heart failure were classified. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class 2-3 and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45% were treated with enalapril 2.5-5.0 mg once daily for 3-15 months (mean 7 months). . Causes of heart failure were former myocardial infarction (n = 7), hypertension (n = 2), and atrial fibrillation (n = 1). Radioiodinated methaiodobenzyl guanidine (123I-MIBG) imaging, radionuclide angiography and treadmill exercise test were performed before and after treatment. With enalapril treatment (1) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased significantly from 38.3% +/- 6.9% to 47.5% +/- 14.7%; (2) six-maximum exercise time significantly increased from 205 +/- 112 to 272 +/- 120 seconds; (3) The heart/mediastinum (H/M) ratio of 123I-MIBG increased significantly (early image: 1.99 +/-0.38 vs. 2.20 +/- 0.50; delayed image: 1 .86 +/- 0.44 vs. 2.09 +/- 0.51) ; and (4) the clearance rate of 123I-MIBG decreased slightly from 29.1% +/- 9.1% to 25.4% +/- 7.0%. The rate of improvement in LVEF was significantly correlated with rates of improvement in H/M ratio and clearance rate after treatment with enalapril. Thus, the long-term effects of enalapril can be observed in the cardiac sympathetic nervous system, and 123I-MIBG imaging appears useful to evaluate the therapeutic effects of enalapril on the cardiac sympathetic nervous system in patients with chronic heart failure.",0,0

The enzyme inhibitor enalapril, titrated to 10 to 40 mg daily (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] between 115 and 140 mm Hg, confirmed by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) in the treatment of black South African patients with severe hypertension. The treatment goal was a sitting DBP <95 mm Hg at week 9 of treatment. This was followed by a 4-month open phase using 10 to 60 mg of nisoldipine CC daily. Ninety-six patients had complete data at baseline and at the end of the double-blind and open phases and were included in this analysis. Titration up to the maximum double-blind drug dose was required in all patients in both groups. Monotherapy with nisoldipine CC, but not enalapril, significantly reduced both sitting and 24-hour standing blood pressure (BP). Twenty-four hour BP in the nisoldipine CC group decreased from 179+/-14 / 118+/-7 to 144+/-16 / 94+/-10 mm Hg (P < .0001) compared to 181+/-13 decreased / 117+/-5 to 171+/-17 / 110+/-11 mm Hg in the enalapril group (P = ns). The profound reduction in blood pressure achieved with nisoldipine CC was accompanied by a significant reduction in left ventricular [LV] mass index observed after only 2 months of treatment (from 146+/-40 to 129+/-35 g/m2, P = . 05). In contrast, enalapril had no effect on LV mass (139+/-36 to 142+/-50 g/m2, P = NS). The antihypertensive effect of nisoldipine CC was also demonstrated in the open phase, where the 24-hour BP decreased from 180+/-14 / 118+/-6 mm Hg (baseline) to 142+/-16 / 92+/-. 10 mm Hg (P < .0001) at the end of the 16 week open phase. This effect persisted, with a trough-to-peak ratio of 74% for systolic blood pressure and 67% for diastolic blood pressure, with further regression in LV mass. A reduction in 24-hour systolic blood pressure to <135 mm Hg in patients treated with nisoldipine CC was associated with a greater degree of regression of LV mass index. The incidence of adverse events was low in both groups, and both nisoldipine CC and enalapril were well tolerated. The incidence of overt ventricular arrhythmias was also low and did not change with treatment. In conclusion, our findings suggest that once-daily nisoldipine CC can be considered an appropriate first-line antihypertensive agent in black patients with severe hypertension, due to its severe and sustained blood pressure lowering effect and associated with significant left ventricular regression. mass and low side-effect profile.",0,0
34,10090351,Fosinopril reduces soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 levels in borderline hypertensive type II diabetic patients with microalbuminuria.,,"Gasic, S; Wagner, O F; Fasching, P; Ludwig, C; Veitl, M; Kapiotis, S; Jilma, B","Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are a mainstay for the treatment of heart failure and diabetic microalbuminuria. Recently, ACE-I has been found to reduce plasma levels of circulating vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (cVCAM-1) in patients with congestive heart failure. As increased cVCAM-1 levels are pathognomonic for diabetics with microangiopathy, we investigated the effects of ACE-I on plasma levels of cVCAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (cICAM-1), and cE-selectin in microalbuminuric diabetes patients. In addition, the effects of ACE-I on plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) were studied. Fosinopril (10 mg/day) was administered to 11 microalbuminuric patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) for 12 weeks. As expected, baseline plasma concentrations of cE-selectin, cICAM-1, and cVCAM-1 were significantly higher in patients than in healthy control subjects (n = 82; P < .001). Levels of PAI-1 in NIDDM were similar to those in control subjects, while TPA levels in patients were approximately 25% lower than in control subjects (P = .013). After treatment with fosinopril, serum levels of cVCAM-1 decreased by -19% (CI: -25% to -13%) (P = .003) and were no longer different from those of the control group. In contrast, plasma levels of cE-selectin, cICAM-1, PAI-1 and TPA were not affected. As expected, microalbuminuria was reduced by -44% (CI: -65 to -22; P = .004). In conclusion, fosinopril reduced cVCAM-1 levels with microalbuminuria in NIDDM. This may represent a novel mechanism of action of ACE-I in diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction. Whether reduced VCAM-1 expression is responsible for the observed reduction in microalbuminuria deserves further investigation.",0,0

In addition, the effect of using a beta-blocker in addition to an ACE inhibitor on these patients has not been fully addressed; This retrospective analysis evaluated the association of initial beta-blocker use with mortality in 4,223 mostly asymptomatic Prevention trial patients and symptomatic Treatment trial patients. 1,015 (24%) Prevention trial patients who received beta-blockers and 197 (8%) Treatment trial patients had fewer symptoms, higher ejection fractions, and different drug use than patients who did not receive beta-blockers. In univariate analysis, beta-blocker use was associated with significantly lower mortality than nonusers in both studies. In addition, a synergistic reduction in mortality was suggested with the use of both beta-blockers and enalapril in the Prevention study. After adjusting for important prognostic variables by Cox multivariate analysis, the association of beta-adrenergic blocking agent use with lower mortality in Prevention trial patients receiving enalapril remained significant. Lower arrhythmic and pump failure death rates and risk of death or hospitalization for heart failure were observed. The combination of a beta-blocker and enalapril was associated with a synergistic reduction in the risk of death in the SOLVD Prevention study.",0,0

Increased conduit atherosclerosis increases pulse pressure and pulsatile load, potentially contributing to adverse outcomes in patients with left ventricular dysfunction; Pulse and mean arterial pressure were analyzed for effects on mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of data collected from 6,781 patients randomized to the Left Ventricular Dysfunction Studies, adjusting for other risk modifiers; Pulse and mean arterial pressure were positively correlated with each other, age, ejection fraction, and prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, and inversely correlated with previous myocardial infarction and beta-adrenergic blocking agent use. Higher pulse pressure was associated with increased female gender prevalence, greater use of calcium channel blocking agents, digoxin, and diuretics, lower heart rate, and a higher rate of reported smoking history. It was associated with higher mean arterial pressure, higher heart rate, lower use of calcium channel blockers and digoxin, and lower New York Heart Association functional class. At 61 months of follow-up, 1,582 deaths (1,397 cardiovascular) occurred. In a multivariate analysis adjusted for covariates and treatment assignment above, higher pulse pressure remained an independent predictor of total and cardiovascular mortality (total mortality relative risk, 1.05 per 10 mm Hg increment; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.10). ; p = 0.02). Mean arterial pressure was inversely related to total and cardiovascular mortality (relative risk of total mortality, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.85 to 0.94; p < 0.0001); A noninvasive blood pressure measurement provides two independent prognostic factors for survival. Increased conduit atherosclerosis, as assessed by pulse pressure, may contribute to increased mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, independent of mean arterial pressure.",0,0

Eight consecutive patients (6 males, 2 females) aged 27-73 years (mean 49.8 years) with known chronic renal failure and solitary kidney referred for ACE therapy between 1991 and 1996 were included. 99Tcm-DTPA renography was performed at the beginning and 1 hour after the administration of 25 mg of captopril at 1-week intervals. CRT was performed with Captopril Renography in accordance with the criteria of the Diagnostic Criteria of Renovascular Hypertension Study Group. The beneficial or deleterious effect of subsequent ACE inhibitor therapy on renal function was determined by long-term follow-up (> or = 2 years).

39,10093769,Heart failure.,,"Rich, M W","Heart failure is predominantly a disease of older adults, and the epidemiology of heart failure largely reflects the convergence of age-related changes in the cardiovascular system and the increasing prevalence of age-related cardiovascular diseases. Diagnosis of heart failure in the elderly is often difficult due to the presence of atypical symptomatology and comorbid conditions. Similarly, optimal treatment often poses a therapeutic challenge due to the high prevalence of confounding medical, behavioral, psychosocial, and economic factors. In addition, there is insufficient data on pharmacotherapy of heart failure in the very elderly (over 80 years) and in the majority of elderly patients with heart failure and preserved left ventricular systolic function. Despite these challenges, a number of therapeutic options, including ACE inhibitors, digoxin, and possibly beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor antagonists, have been shown to favorably influence the clinical course of heart failure in elderly patients. In addition, several studies have documented the effectiveness of multidisciplinary heart failure disease management programs in reducing hospital admissions, improving quality of life, and reducing the cost of care. Currently, the three biggest challenges in the management of elderly heart failure patients are: (1) more effectively apply proven therapies such as ACE inhibitors, disease management systems, and antihypertensive therapy; (2) develop effective therapies for the treatment of diastolic heart failure; and (3) developing more effective methods of preventing heart failure. It is hoped that future work will address each of these critically important issues.",0,0

Of the 62 subjects, 60 completed the study, and the two groups were equally matched for age, body mass index, gender, and blood pressure (BP).

Twenty-four hour and daytime ambulatory monitor systolic pressures were also significantly higher in the SM group. Differences in diastolic blood pressure were not statistically significant. Also, SM patients were less likely to increase their medication and more likely to decrease or discontinue their medication. Doctors and patients found self-measurement convenient and useful. This study demonstrates that physicians' prescribing decisions are influenced by evidence from self-measurement of BP with resulting increases in office BP due to decreased medication use. While self-measurement of BP can offer assurance of adequacy of control while away from a doctor's office, the best evidence for understanding target blood pressures comes from large randomized trials using office blood pressures as an endpoint.

Trough:peak ratios were calculated from two different methods (global and individualized approaches) from 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recordings after the placebo period and after the active treatment period. The residual reduction in blood pressure after single-blind, single-dose omission was also investigated by an additional 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Safety assessments were conducted throughout the study; The placebo-adjusted global diastolic blood pressure trough:peak ratio was 0.80 in the amlodipine group (n = 47) and 0.81 in the perindopril group (n = 49) in an intent-to-treat analysis. The corresponding global systolic blood pressure trough:peak ratio was 0.83 for amlodipine and 0.68 for perindopril. Individual trough: peak ratios did not show a normal distribution. Mean (+/- SD) individual trough: Peak ratios for diatolic blood pressure (therapeutic analysis), 0.50 +/- 0.69 (median 0.42) for amlodipine and 0.15 +/- 3 for perindopril, It was 27 (median 0.33). In the per-protocol analysis, the corresponding values were 0.50 +/- 0.72 (median 0.34) for amlodipine and 0.01 +/- 3.90 (median 0.21) for perindopril. Both treatments produced comparable reductions in clinical systolic and diastolic blood pressure between days 0 and 60. Forty-eight hours after the last dose, patients treated with amlodipine had lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure than patients treated with perindopril. Amlodipine and perindopril were generally well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events were leg edema in amlodipine-treated patients (19.1%) and cough in perindopril-treated patients (14.3%); These results did not show a statistically significant difference in trough: peak ratios between amlodipine and perindopril. However, ambulatory blood pressure trough:peak ratios varied widely. Determination of the trough: with the traditional approach or with an individual approach, the peak ratios can give different values. After skipping a dose, a condition that mimics incompatibility, blood pressure was controlled more effectively with amlodipine than with perindopril.",0,0

Patients were initially randomized to receive either placebo or a single 5 mg dose of ramipril, followed 1 week later to receive ramipril 5 mg daily for 6 months. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate were measured every 20 minutes for 24 hours. Single dose ramipril decreased both SBP and DBP (P < .001) without affecting heart rate. Long-term treatment produced a small additive antihypertensive effect, again without altering heart rate. Cosinor analysis showed that compared to placebo, both administrations of ramipril effectively reduced SBP and DBP mesors (P < .001); circadian rhythms remained intact. Heart rate was also not changed in any of the circadian parameters. However, a significant reduction (P < .001) in blood pressure amplitude occurred after long-term treatment and may be of importance in preventing cardiac damage.",0,0

Since the occurrence of LVH appears to be multifactorial, antihypertensive therapy should aim to reduce not only pressure values but also hypertrophic ventricular mass. This result can only be achieved when drugs that can act on both pathogenetic factors are used. To evaluate the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy on regression of LVH, 21 patients with stage 2 essential hypertension were treated for one year with atenolol (120 mg/day orally), a cardioselective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, or ramipril (5 mg). /d oral), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with high tissue activity. Both treatments provided significant control of hypertension and regression of LVH.

55,10155301,Quality of Life measures for patients taking which drugs? Clinical PCASEE perspective.,,"Bech, P","Of the many publications on quality of life in medicine in the last 20 years, only a small portion is devoted to drug trials. The most frequently investigated are classes of drugs in cancer disorders, hypertension, and depressive illness. Health-related quality of life (QOL) measures are typically applied in chronic or subchronic disorders where the balance between efficacy (disease-modifying drug effects) and safety (adverse drug reactions) is assessed by patients in terms of subjective well-being. . In this context, quality of life is an attempt to help the doctor listen to his patient. Components of QOL measurements will be found in the PCASEE model: P = physical indicators; C = cognitive indicators; A = emotional indicators; S = social indicators; E = economic-social stressors or adverse life events; and E = ego function or personality issues. Most variance in QOL measures is due to processing cognitive (eg, lack of control, concentration difficulties) or emotional (eg, depressed mood or anxiety) components. The most specific component, of course, is adverse drug reactions, which are typically gastrointestinal symptoms in cancer treatments, and circulatory symptoms and sexual function with antihypertensive drugs. However, the affective and cognitive components also have different weights in subclasses of drugs such as antihypertensive agents. Thus, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors act on the affective component (depression and anxiety) and calcium channel blockers on the cognitive component (neurasthenia). In general, patients with cancer or hypertension make more reliable assessments of their cognitive and emotional symptoms from their doctors, while patients with primary depression are less reliable than their doctors or relatives in measuring changes in the emotional component of their illness when they are sick. . Health-related QOL measures not only have an impact on the doctor-patient relationship, but also include a holistic approach to drug therapy by controlling all PCASEE components.",0,0
56,10164060,Formula management of ACE inhibitors.,,"Gerbrandt, K R; Yedinak, K C","An increasing number of ACE inhibitors are available in recent years. Because these agents are all similar, careful scrutiny is required when making formulation decisions to determine the particular advantages of particular agents. Differences between agents have been described regarding structure and tissue specificity, but the clinical significance of these differences is unclear. ACE inhibitors vary widely in biotransformation, distribution, and elimination. Disease states such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and liver or kidney failure may affect the distribution of specific ACE inhibitors. These agents can vary significantly in duration of action, and once-daily ACE inhibitors can optimize patient compliance and reduce costs. ACE inhibitors have been extensively studied in patients with hypertension, CHF or nephropathy and following myocardial infarction (MI). Differences in efficacy between agents are often due to differences in study design or comparison of non-equivalent dosages. The benefits of ACE inhibitors are likely to be class effects, and the use of an agent is probably reasonable even if large-scale clinical trials have not been conducted with that drug. Little differences in side effects or drug interactions have been found between ACE inhibitors, and these factors are of little importance when making formula-based decisions. Cost and availability may differ between agents and will depend on geographic location and organization-specific purchasing agreements. ACE inhibitors have shown positive effects on quality of life compared to agents of other classes. Quality of life studies directly comparing ACE inhibitors have produced conflicting results. In the case of hypertension, cost-effectiveness reviews typically find that newer, longer-acting ACE inhibitors provide the greatest financial benefit. Differences in cost-effectiveness in the post-MI patient population are typically the result of differences in protocol design, including treatment time and non-drug costs. ACE inhibitors are highly homogeneous and choosing between agents can be difficult. Clinical efficacy, duration of action, and cost are major concerns in the selection of agents to include in a formulation.",0,0
57,10169388,Economic evaluation of ACE inhibitor therapy of nephropathy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in Italy.,,"Garattini, L; Brunetti, M; Salvioni, F; Barosi, M","Diabetic nephropathy is one of the main complications of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and proteinuria is the main clinical manifestation of diabetic nephropathy. Most patients who develop overt proteinuria progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), usually within 5 to 7 years; ESRD requires dialysis or a kidney transplant. Although an association between lowering blood pressure and delaying ESRD has long been assumed, only recently a controlled randomized clinical trial has shown that treatment of diabetic nephropathy with an ACE inhibitor can significantly delay the loss of kidney function, and therefore, ESRD. Consistent with the clinical trial upon which this economic assessment was based, the costs and outcomes of 2 alternatives were evaluated: (i) patients subject to blood pressure control, with antihypertensive medication only, but without an ACE inhibitor (placebo group) and (ii) ACE inhibitor therapy (captopril group). patients given blood pressure control similar to the placebo group. This cost-effectiveness analysis was made from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service [Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (SSN)]. Accordingly, only direct costs related to publicly funded health care are included. The number of years of dialysis avoided (DYA) was the clinical endpoint. A time horizon of 10 years was considered for the economic evaluation. Captopril therapy was predominant, but also more effective and less costly. The total cost of the captopril alternative over the 10-year period was 21,901,625 Italian lira per patient (L; 1993 values), while the total cost of the placebo alternative was L30,352,590 per patient. Compared to placebo, 20.01 DYA per 100 patients treated with captopril therapy during the trial period was estimated, equivalent to 2.4 months per patient. The robustness of this result was confirmed by sensitivity analysis: captopril remained dominant for both ends. This economic evaluation, requested by the Italian Ministry of Health, showed that there was a saving in health expenditures with the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with proteinuria.",0,0

The perspective of the analysis was that of the county councils (third party payers) and we focused on drug and hospitalization costs. The marginal cost-effectiveness of treatment was estimated over 3 treatment periods: 1, 2 and 3.8 years. Cost-effectiveness rates ranged from SEK 14,148 to SEK 33,033 per life-year gained ($US1 = SEK7.70 SEK. 1 SEK = 12.40 SEK) for 3 treatment cycles.

Clinical pharmacists at a county hospital in Indianapolis, IN were screened for ADRs. Patient information was reviewed every four days at admission, during hospitalization, and at discharge. ADRs occurring after hospitalization were evaluated for causation, severity, pharmacological type (ie, idiosyncratic reaction to enhanced pharmacology), and organ system affected. Nurse and pharmacist reports, event reports, physician consultations, patient transfers to critical care units, and serum drug concentration reports were additional tools of ADR identification. Overall, 23.1% of patients experienced ADR, with 2.6% of 11,702 drug exposures resulting in ADR. Patients older than 65 years (20.5% versus 29.6% for younger patients) and women (26.2% versus 20% for men) were at higher risk for developing ADR (p < 0.05).

In this study, 101 male patients from our outpatient hypertension clinic answered detailed questionnaires about hypertension and sexual function. Patients with perceived impotence were offered a comprehensive penile evaluation and examination by specialists in the urology department. Twenty-seven (27%) men had impotence. The main cause of impotence was arterial dysfunction (89%). The prevalence of impotence is related to the degree of secondary organ manifestations reflected by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification I-III (P = .01). Intermittent claudication (P = .001) and ischemic heart disease (P = .005) were the best predictors in this regard. Twelve impotent patients (44%) attributed the onset of impotence to drug initiation. Various drugs have been blamed for the emergence of drug-induced impotence.

However, ACE inhibition does not fully suppress Ang II formation and also leads to the accumulation of bradykinin. Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors are believed to promote the known harmful effects of Ang II. Therefore, AT1 receptor antagonists have recently been included in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF). Although there are substantial differences in the effects of ACE inhibitors, including unopposed stimulation of angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptors by AT1 receptor antagonists and AT1 receptor antagonists, the debate over whether ACE inhibitors, AT1 receptor antagonists, or a combination of both, is superior is still largely in the pharmacotherapy of CHF. is theoretical. Accordingly, AT1 receptor antagonists are still under investigation. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors remain the first-line therapy in patients with CHF due to systolic dysfunction. However, AT1 receptor antagonism is a good alternative in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitor-induced side effects, especially cough. In clinical practice, emphasis should be placed on increasing the use of ACE inhibitors, as more than 50% of patients with CHF do not take ACE inhibitors. Additionally, most users of ACE inhibitors take lower doses than those used in large clinical trials. Although not yet fully proven, inhibition of ACE at high doses is likely to be superior to lower doses in terms of prognosis and symptoms.",0,0

Forearm blood flow responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were evaluated by venous occlusion plethysmography. Subjects were then randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive lisinopril, 20 mg/day (n=20) or placebo (n=20) for 6 months. Then plethysmography was repeated. Baseline variables between groups were comparable. Blood pressure decreased significantly in the lisinopril group [systolic: 145+/-4 to 128+/-4 mmHg (P<0.001)); diastolic: 84+/-2 to 74+/-2 mmHg (P<0.001)]. An improvement in the vasodilatory response (expressed as the ratio of infused/control arm) to acetylcholine was found at 30 microg/ml, e.g. 3.33+/-0.3 (front) and 4.45+/-0.48 (post) ) as well as nitroprusside, eg at 3.2 microg/ml (P<0.01) eg. 3.0+/-0.2 (front) versus 3.86+/-0.3 (post). In the placebo group, vasodilation was not significantly altered in response to acetylcholine and nitroprusside responses were not changed. The presented data show that 6 months of lisinopril treatment has a beneficial effect on arterial function in patients with hyperlipidemia. Further studies should now investigate whether angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are beneficial in reducing mortality and morbidity in hypercholesterolemia.",0,0

Some randomized trials and many prospective studies address anemia, hyperparathyroidism, and multidisciplinary predialysis care. The benefits of lipid lowering are suggested by randomized trials among patients without kidney disease; The progression of renal failure, especially in patients with proteinuria, can be slowed by lowering blood pressure. In this case, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are more beneficial than other antihypertensives. Partial correction of anemia with iron, erythropoietin, or androgens can improve quality of life and potentially prevent heart disease. Renal bone disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism can be partially prevented by early dietary phosphate restriction, use of calcium-containing phosphate binders, and active vitamin D. Correction of acidosis can improve protein metabolism and bone and cardiovascular health. Treatment of hyperlipidemia can reduce cardiovascular disease. Early involvement of a nephrology-based multidisciplinary team has the potential to reduce morbidity and costs, increase patients' knowledge of their condition, and prolong the time before dialysis is required. The care of patients with progressive renal failure is complex and requires attention to detail. Family physicians play a vital role in these efforts and should be involved in all aspects of care.",0,0

Ten other patients with similar clinical features were studied before and during treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine.

Clinical assessment, treatment, and monitoring for hypertension are modeled with the incidence-based Markov model. Clinical inputs include agent efficacy, side effects, and adherence to dosing schedules. The clinical and laboratory monitoring programs recommended by the JNC are followed for each agent. Transitions occur between classes for therapeutic failures. Medication and medical care costs are valued in 1995 US dollars.; Although patients whose hypertension was initially treated with amlodipine were more easily controlled than patients given other agents, initial costs for achieving and maintaining hypertension control were lowest for chlorthalidone ($641), followed by acebutolol ($920), amlodipine ($946). , and enalapril ($948). Maintenance costs were lowest for chlorthalidone. For all agents except chlortalidone, drug costs were the largest component of overall costs, followed by office visits, laboratory monitoring, and cross-class costs for therapeutic failures; Following JNC guidelines, a slightly higher percentage of patients will achieve hypertension control with a newer class of calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), but at a much higher cost than a general diuretic (chlortalidone).",0,0
79,10220238,Did we learn evidence-based medicine in medical school? Some common medical mythology.,,"Paauw, D S","Medical myths arise for many different reasons. A common thread is that they all make some level of pathophysiological meaning. A good example is the concern of using oral cobalamin when treating pernicious anemia. The difficulty in absorbing vitamin B12 in the absence of intrinsic factor does not preclude oral replacement; the dose just needs to be higher. Pathophysiological concerns have also been an important reason why doctors avoid using beta-blockers in patients with diabetes. They fear that beta-blockers will block adrenergic symptoms and patients may not know they are hypoglycemic. In studies addressing this issue, there appears to be no real problem with increased episodes of severe hypoglycaemia or increased hypoglycemic unconsciousness in patients using beta-blockers. Several studies have commented on the unexpected symptom of increased sweating associated with hypoglycemia in diabetic patients taking beta-blockers. Another important concept behind some medical myths is excessive reliance on case reports or reliable texts. Concern about depression associated with beta-blocker use stemmed from a widely cited case report. Subsequent studies did not show convincing evidence for a strong association with beta-blocker use and depression. The strong position against narcotic use in Cope's Early Diagnosis of Acute Abdomen is probably why the myth of avoiding narcotics for pain relief in patients with undiagnosed acute abdomen persists. The only two studies that have addressed this issue have not shown any diagnostic problems caused by providing narcotic pain relievers. Newer treatments are often more closely scrutinized before being accepted, including placebo-controlled trials to demonstrate a drug's effectiveness. This may not be the case with new technologies. It is more difficult to assess the usefulness of a new technology against incomparable prior technologies. Catheterization of the right side of the heart (Swan-Ganz catheter) was a widely used technology before any outcome studies were conducted. Numerous reports over the last decade have shown increased mortality and increased resource utilization in patients undergoing right-sided cardiac catheterization. Most new drug treatments require randomized data to demonstrate effects before widespread use and acceptance can occur. Older treatments that have long been widely accepted may not have controlled trial data behind recommendations for their use, and once practiced patterns are hard to change. ""Will this help my patient live better or longer?"" It's always good to ask questions. when prescribing a therapy. These myths highlight the importance and usefulness of outcome-based research to help guide physicians in their practice.",0,0

82,10221346,Effects of spironolactone and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor on left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with essential hypertension.,,"Sato, A; Suzuki, Y; Saruta, T","There is increasing evidence of important cardiovascular effects of aldosterone through classical mineralocorticoid receptors in the heart. Co-administration of aldosterone with excess salt causes both cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial cardiac fibrosis in rats, and concomitant administration of potassium canrenoate at only a moderate blood pressure lowering dose completely blocks the cardiac effects of aldosterone. In this study, we examined the effect of adding a low dose mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone (25 mg/day) to an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril maleate) on left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with essential hypertension. Eighteen untreated patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension according to WHO/ISH guidelines participated in this study. Subjects were given either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor alone (group I: 10 patients, 4 males and 6 females, mean age 56+/-18 years) or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor plus spironolactone (group II: 8 patients, 3 males and 5 women, average age 59 +/- 14 years) for 9 months. Left ventricular mass index, various echocardiographic variables, mean blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and pretreatment plasma aldosterone concentration were similar in the two groups. Blood pressure decreased significantly and similarly in both groups after antihypertensive treatment (group I, 136 +/- 9/82 +/- 9 mmHg; group II, 133 +/- 9/85 +/- 10 mmHg). Left ventricular mass index was also significantly decreased in both groups (group I, -10.2% +/- 7.1%; group II, --18.1 +/- 6.9%). The extent of the reduction was significantly greater in the spironolactone group (group II) (group I vs. p < 0.05).

It lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity but appears to have nitric oxide-mediated vasodilator effects. Nebivolol is administered as a racemic mixture of equal proportions of the d- and l-enantiomers. The drug does not significantly affect glucose or plasma lipid metabolism and appears to have a protective effect on left ventricular function. At the recommended dose (5 mg once daily), nebivolol reduces resting diastolic blood pressure as effectively as standard therapeutic doses of atenolol, metoprolol, lisinopril, and nifedipine, as demonstrated in comparative studies. Nebivolol lowered blood pressure significantly more than 10mg per day of enalapril in the short term but not the long term, although the enalapril dose may not be optimal. Nebivolol in combination with hydrochlorothiazide has an additive effect. Standing blood pressure and/or mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure are significantly and similarly reduced by nebivolol, atenolol or nifedipine. Nebivolol tended to prevent early morning blood pressure increases better than nifedipine. Overall response rates to nebivolol therapy (sitting/supine diastolic blood pressure decrease to < or = 90 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure to 10% or > or = 10 mm Hg) ranged from 58 to 81% after 4 to 52 sessions. weekly treatment. In comparative studies, response rates were higher in nebivolol than in enalapril or metoprolol recipients, but not significantly different from those in atenolol or nifedipine recipients. Nebivolol 5 mg once daily is well tolerated in patients with hypertension. Adverse events are infrequent, transient, and mild to moderate. The most commonly reported are headache, fatigue, paresthesia, and dizziness. Few studies reported no signs of orthostatic hypotension with nebivolol. Comparative trials showed no significant difference in frequency and severity of adverse events in patients receiving nebivolol, atenolol, enalapril, or placebo; however, the overall incidence of adverse events was higher with nifedipine or metoprolol. Some atenolol or enalapril, but not nebivolol, recipients reported impotence or decreased libido during treatment; Available evidence indicates that nebivolol 5 mg once daily is a well tolerated beta-blocker that is as effective as atenolol and other classes of antihypertensive agents once daily. Therefore, it can be recommended as a useful alternative first-line treatment option for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension.",0,0

After 4 weeks, there was a mandatory dose escalation to 10/100 mg daily of felodipine-metoprolol and 50/25 mg of captopril-hydrochlorothiazide daily, after which treatment was continued for another 4 weeks. At the end of the study, felodipine-metoprolol lowered supine blood pressure significantly more than captopril-hydrochlorothiazide. After 8 weeks, the mean differences in change in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure between treatments were 5.2 and 3.4 mm Hg in favor of felodipine-metoprolol, respectively (p<0.05). Standing blood pressure also showed trends in favor of felodipine-metoprolol. The proportion of respondents was similar in both groups. Both treatments were well tolerated. Two patients treated with felodipine-metoprolol and 5 patients treated with captopril-hydrochlorothiazide discontinued treatment due to adverse events. The felodipine-metoprolol combination reduced supine blood pressure significantly more than captopril-hydrochlorothiazide with preserved tolerability.",0,0

In this study, we measured the rates of total, oxidative and non-oxidative glucose disposal, glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, endogenous glucose production, and lipid oxidation using 4-hour euglycemic (approximately 5 mmol/L) hyperinsulinemic (approximately 300 pmol/L). Clamp in combination with dual infusion of glucose tracer ([3-(3)H]- and [U-14C] D-glucose) and indirect calorimetry in 40 non-obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. Subjects were studied in duplicate: after a 4-week acclimation period and 16 weeks double-blind, lacidipine 4-6 mg/day, a calcium channel blocker (n = 19), or lisinopril 10-20 mg/day, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 21). Antihypertensive treatment resulted in a significant increase in total glucose excretion during insulin clamping, as well as basal and insulin-stimulated non-oxidative glucose disposal rates. In contrast, oxidative glucose excretion was significantly reduced with antihypertensive treatment, especially at baseline. Changes in glucose excretion rates in subjects treated with lacidipine and those treated with lisinopril were not significantly different. The suppression of endogenous glucose production during insulin clamping was significantly greater after lisinopril than after lacidipine. These results suggest that treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes with lacidipine or lisinopril has no adverse effect on glucose metabolism. Conversely, both drugs seem to improve insulin sensitivity.",0,0

Information on the occurrence of atrial fibrillation/- flutter during hospitalization was prospectively collected for the following three periods: day 1-2, day 3-4, and day 5 until discharge. A total of 1395 patients (21%) experienced atrial fibrillation/- flutter during one or more of the specified periods during hospitalization. Patients with atrial fibrillation/- flutter were significantly older, a significantly greater proportion were women, left ventricular systolic dysfunction was more common, less thrombolytic therapy was received, and anterior Q-wave myocardial infarction was more common than patients without atrial fibrillation/- flutter.

To determine the incidence, clinical features, acute management, and clinical course of severe hypertension with severe, uncomplicated hypertension and stable hypertensive complications presenting to emergency care in a large public teaching hospital; Graphical survey of consecutive emergency room visits; Of 2898 consecutive visits to the emergency department of a public teaching hospital, 91 were for particularly severe, uncomplicated hypertension; Of the 2898 consecutive medical emergency department visits, 142 (4.9%) patient visits were made specifically for systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or =220 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or =120 mm Hg. Of the 142 patient visits, 91 were for severe hypertension in the absence of acute target organ effect or neuroretinopathy. Eighty-nine patients received acute drug therapy. Twenty-nine patients received two drugs and 15 patients received three drugs. Sixty-eight patients (75%) received clonidine and 15 (16.5%) took short-acting nifedipine, despite widely published concerns about the safety of this practice. We found wide variability in blood pressure response to treatment. The mean decrease in SBP was 50+/-31 mm Hg and the mean decrease in DBP was 34+/-20 mm Hg over 4.2+/-2.9 hours. SBP was decreased below 160 mm Hg in 42 patients (46%) and DBP below 100 mm Hg in 46 patients (50%). Long-term management and follow-up were inadequate. Of 74 patients discharged from the emergency department, 22 (30%) had uncontrolled hypertension for an average of 33+/-28 days, 10 with hypertensive complications; Severe hypertension remains an important and widespread problem. Doctors seem to place a strong emphasis on acutely lowering blood pressure to near-normal levels.

In the presence of traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis, endothelial function is suppressed, and various treatments such as lipid-lowering therapy in hypercholesterolemia can improve endothelium-mediated vasodilation. ACE inhibition improved this function in many conditions, including type I diabetes, but there is no evidence of a beneficial effect in type II diabetes; The effect of enalapril (10 mg twice daily for 4 weeks) on endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilator function was determined in 10 patients with type II diabetes using a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover protocol. Forearm blood flow was measured using strain gauge plethysmography and graded intrabrachial acetylcholine (ACh), N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (LNMMA), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP); Enalapril increased the response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator ACh (p < 0.02) and the vasoconstrictor response to the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor LNMMA (p < 0.002).

How do you know if it's an emergency or an urgency?,,"Bales, A","Hypertensive crisis occurs when critically high blood pressure is accompanied by diastolic pressure greater than 120 to 130 mm Hg. The presence of acute or ongoing end-organ damage constitutes a hypertensive emergency that requires lowering of blood pressure within minutes or hours to avoid disastrous consequences. Critically high blood pressure without end-organ damage is known as hypertensive urgency, which is usually treated within 24 to 48 hours in a closely monitored outpatient setting. While hypertensive crises are relatively rare, most primary care physicians will eventually encounter them. Therefore, for optimal patient outcomes, it is important to be aware of the appropriate treatment options as well as the impact of potential complications on treatment.",0,0

Prior to drug treatment, the 2 hypertensive groups had significantly higher tPA and higher PAI-1 activity than normotensive subjects. Although PAI-1 activity decreased significantly after drug treatment in the enalapril group, there was no significant change in tPA. Although PAI-1 activity increased significantly in the nitrendipine group after drug treatment, there was no significant change in tPA; Thus, enalapril ameliorated impaired fibrinolysis, but nitrendipine worsened fibrinolysis in essential hypertension.

Characteristic vascular changes lead to systemic and renal vasoconstriction. Changes in blood pressure are often associated with disruption of circadian regulation and can promote rapid development of target organ damage, including intracranial hemorrhage, left ventricular hypertrophy, and microangiopathic hemolysis. The mechanisms underlying this disorder are complex and include altered vascular endothelial function. While vasodilators such as prostacyclin and nitric oxide are suppressed, vasoconstrictors including endothelin increase.

To delineate direct drug effects from the vascular insufficiency inherent in hypertensive states, the study was performed on a normotensive animal model. Adverse effects of these drugs were estimated as changes in sexual behavior and intracavernous pressure response of electrical stimulation in treated rats compared with normal controls of the same age (n = 10, each group). Mating studies have shown significant impairment of sexual function in groups receiving propranolol and clonidine. The cavernous pressure response to nerve stimulation at the end of sixteen weeks further reinforced the great agreement on sexual function in these two treated groups. In contrast, administration of captopril produced only marginal changes in recorded responses. The results obtained from this study clearly show that while propranolol and clonidine affect the nerve-mediated response to sexual behavior and erection, captopril may be a better treatment option without significant effects on these parameters.",0,0

We analyzed death data from 11,575 patients with coronary artery disease screened for the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention study. A total of 1,247 patients (11%) were treated with ACE inhibitors. Of these, 618 (50%) used aspirin; Five-year mortality was lower in patients using ACE inhibitors and aspirin than patients receiving ACE inhibitors without aspirin (27% versus 19%; p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounders, treatment with aspirin and ACE inhibitors remained associated with a lower risk of death than use of ACE inhibitors alone (relative risk [RR] = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.56 to 0.91). A subgroup analysis of 464 patients with congestive heart failure treated with ACE inhibitors revealed 221 patients (48%) using aspirin and 243 patients not taking aspirin.

Group study design in black hypertensives over a 56-day treatment period. Changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were determined using repeated ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring. Both sampatrilat and lisinopril reduced plasma ACE concentrations after 28 and 56 days.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) for vascular endothelium is one of the most potent and specific growth factors that have a protective effect against endothelial dysfunction. HGF production is down-regulated in vitro by angiotensin II (Ang II). We hypothesized that HGF production is impaired as a result of increased Ang II in patients with congestive heart failure and, if so, that impaired production should be restored with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). We studied 16 patients with congestive heart failure caused by a previous anterior myocardial infarction, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%+/-8% (mean+/-SD). Before and approximately 4 weeks after treatment with ACE-I, blood samples were collected to measure HGF, Ang II, and brain natriuretic peptide levels as a biochemical marker for the severity of heart failure. We also examined 5 control subjects in which heparin increased HGF production 48+/-5-fold. However, HGF response to heparin was significantly reduced in patients with heart failure (24 ± 5 fold, P<0.05 versus control). Treatment with ACE-I reduced Ang II and brain natriuretic peptide levels and increased HGF production in response to heparin 43 ± 7-fold, comparable to the control response. In conclusion, impaired HGF production was restored after treatment with ACE-I, probably by the mechanism of Ang II suppression. This novel effect of ACE-I may contribute to clinical improvement in patients with heart failure and thus have an important therapeutic effect.",0,0

Each patient's best drug was then repeated to assess reproducibility. Two measures of individual variability in response were used. First, the rotation value was measured by the increasing proportion of patients achieving target blood pressure with their best drug compared to the first drug. Second, we assessed whether responses to each drug were interrelated; Significant variability in response was found. Of the 41 patients who achieved their target blood pressure (< or = 140/90 mm Hg), 20 did not achieve this target on their first medication. Rotation increased monotherapy success from 22/56 (39%) to 41/56 (73%) (p=0.0001); Half of the patients had blood pressure of 135/85 mm Hg or less at best treatment.

This fact suggests that captopril may release histamine from mast cells; Peritoneal mast cells were obtained from rats. Cells were purified by Percoll. Aliquots of mast cells were incubated with captopril or vehicle. Histamine was determined by spectrofluorimetric assay; Results were analyzed with the Kruskall-Wallis (ANOVA) test. The study showed that captopril releases histamine from mast cells. The process depends on the presence of Ca2+ in the brood medium. As a mast cell membrane stabilizer, sodium cromoglycate inhibits the action of captopril; Our results suggest that the allergic side effects of captopril may be related to histamine release from mast cells.",0,0

A more appropriate way to present the extent of benefit would be in terms of increased life expectancy, but this approach was previously not possible due to limited data on long-term outcomes. We aimed to calculate the effect of trandolapril on life expectancy with follow-up data from the Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) Study; The TRACE study demonstrated a significant survival benefit with trandolapril in patients who had previously had decreased left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction and had been treated for at least 2 years. In June 1998, we determined the survival status of all patients in the TRACE study, during which they were followed for at least 6 years. We estimated life expectancy as the average life expectancy at which 50% of patients died. The change in life expectancy is expressed as the change in median life expectancy. The analysis was therapeutic; Patients' life expectancy was 4.6 years for those given placebo and 6.2 years for those given trandolapril. Thus, the median life expectancy for patients receiving trandolapril increased by 15.3 months, or 27% (95% CI 7 to 51).

The trough:peak ratio values calculated after Fourier analysis of ABPM data in individual patients were independent of drug dose. Combination with diuretic resulted in slightly higher trough:peak ratios than ACE inhibitor monotherapy, but the difference was not significant. The median trough:peak ratio was 0.48 in patients using enalapril-based therapy and 0.65 when receiving lisinopril-based therapy (n = 28, P < 0.005).

The primary endpoint was the incidence of persistent, dry cough not due to upper respiratory tract infection; change in sitting diastolic blood pressure and overall incidence of cough were secondary endpoints. During the first 12 weeks of double-blind treatment, treatment with enalapril was associated with a 3.45-fold higher risk of definitive cough (14/261 vs. 4/259, P = 0.018).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of HBP history on the clinical efficacy of early treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor zofenopril in patients with pre-AMI. We summarize the results of a post-hoc analysis of data from the Long-Term Evaluation of Myocardial Infarction Survival (SMILE) study, which randomly evaluated the efficacy of zofenopril given within 24 hours of symptom onset in anterior AMI patients who did not experience thrombolysis. Of the 1441 patients included in the study, 565 (39.2%) had a history of THP. The mean follow-up was 12 months, and the main outcome measures were 6 weeks of combined death and severe congestive heart failure (CHF) and 1-year mortality. The relative risk of death or severe CHF after 6 weeks of treatment with zofenopril was 0.60 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45-0.81; 2P < .05) in the hypertensive group and 0.89 (0.74-1.08; 2P = .62) for normotensive patients, The 1-year risk of death was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.23.0.89; 2P < 0.05) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.52-1.17; 2P = .22), respectively .

However, there is little evidence that inhibition of endogenous bradykinin degradation actually contributes to the effects of ACE inhibitors or indeed other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin II type I receptor (AT(1)) antagonists, and no evidence that it does so in patients with heart failure. ; Twelve patients (11 men, 1 woman, aged 59 to 81 years) with heart failure were randomized to double-blind crossover therapy with enalapril 10 mg BID followed by losartan 25 mg BID or vice versa for 5 weeks each. At the end of each treatment period, forearm blood flow was measured before and after intrabrachial infusion of Hoe-140 (a potent, selective and long-acting bradykinin antagonist) by venous occlusion plethysmography during an intrabrachial bradykinin infusion. Bradykinin caused profound vasodilation (peak, 357+/-67) after enalapril and less (peak, 230+/--46) after losartan. Despite this, Hoe-140 had no discernible effect after enalapril or losartan. Similarly, despite the finding that Hoe-140 significantly reduced vasodilation to bradykinin after enalapril (peak, 192% ± 35%) and losartan (peak, 66% ± 13%) occurred; Inhibition of endogenous bradykinin degradation does not appear to contribute to the effects of ACE inhibition or AT(1) antagonism in the forearm of patients with resting heart failure; however, ACE inhibition has very pronounced effects on exogenous compared to AT(1) antagonism. bradykinin.",0,0

We studied 50 hypertensive patients randomized to receive either 20 mg of fosinopril or 50 mg of atenolol daily for 16 weeks. ACE activity was measured in biopsy samples from skeletal muscle. Office and ambulatory blood pressure, serum ACE and left ventricular wall thickness measurements were also performed. The same studies were conducted in a cross-sectional study of 50 healthy elderly men. Muscle ACE was inversely proportional to blood pressure in cross-sectional analyzes in both populations (p < 0.05). During atenolol treatment, muscle ACE activity tended to increase (14%, p = 0.059) and this increase was inversely proportional to changes in standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.62, p = 0.0044 and r = 0.54, p = 0.016, respectively). When the two populations were combined, muscle ACE was inversely proportional to left ventricular wall thickness (r = -0.29, p = 0.0053).

In this study, 24-hour recording methods were used to examine the hypothesis that the hypertensive response to a high NaCl diet during the normal waking hours (nighttime) of rats was exacerbated in SHR and induced in WKY rats treated with captopril for life; SHR and WKY rats were (1) untreated, (2) treated with captopril for life, or (3) treated with captopril for life, but discontinued 2 weeks before exposure to a high (8%) NaCl diet; In SHR consistently treated with captopril, compared with untreated SHR, the high NaCl diet resulted in a faster and greater increase in arterial pressure. Discontinuation of captopril therapy did not significantly reduce this NaCl sensitivity. In untreated WKY rats, the high NaCl diet did not change the mean arterial pressure, but in the lifetime captopril-treated WKY rats, the high NaCl diet caused a rapid increase in arterial pressure. In WKY rats, discontinuation of life-long captopril treatment did not reduce this NaCl-induced increase in arterial pressure, although the baseline mean arterial pressure in this group was similar to that in untreated WKY rats; Lifetime captopril treatment accelerates the hypertensive response to a high NaCl diet at SHR and induces a similar response in WKY rats. In both strains, life-long treatment with captopril causes a change in response that is not dependent on concomitant administration of the drug. This finding also suggests that life-long captopril therapy causes a prolonged reset of cardiovascular response mechanisms.",0,0

153,10423601,The benefit of moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide in moderately severe essential hypertension.,,"White, W B; Koch, B; Stimpel, M","The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor moexipril versus hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage II and III essential hypertension. This was a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study evaluating moexipril (15 and 30 mg once daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 and 50 mg once daily), and drug combinations (15 mg moexipril/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 30 mg moexipril). Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg in 272 hypertensive patients with an established diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 100 to 114 mm Hg). The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in sitting diastolic BP at the end of the dosing period. Secondary efficacy measures included changes in systolic BP and standing BP. Lower doses of moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide similarly reduced diastolic BP (-8.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg versus -8.0 +/- 1.4; p = NS), higher doses of monotherapeutic regimens (moexipril, -9.7 +/- 1.2 mm Hg versus hydrochlorothiazide, -11.0 +/- 1.2 mm Hg, p = NS). Moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide combinations reduced diastolic BP significantly more than either monotherapy (low doses, -16.0 +/- 1.4 mm Hg; p < 0.001; higher doses, -17.9 +/- 1, 2 mm Hg; p < 0.001). Similar trends were observed for systolic BP. Cessation rates due to adverse events were 0% for patients on moexipril monotherapy and 3% to 5% for patients on diuretic or combination therapy. These data suggest that moexipril 15 and 30 mg once daily lowers BP similarly to hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage II and III hypertension. There is also the additive effect of combining the two agents that lowers BP more significantly than either monotherapy.",0,0

At the end of this period, if there were no major adverse reactions and blood pressure was not below 110/70 mm Hg, doses were titrated to 20 mg quinapril once daily or 25 mg captopril twice daily at the discretion of the physician. Clinical symptoms of heart failure were significantly relieved with both drugs at the end of a 12-week treatment period. At study start, 23 (35%) of 65 patients receiving quinapril and 27 (41%) of 66 patients receiving captopril were in NYHA functional class III, compared with only 4 (6) % of patients in the quinapril group and captopril at study end. 14 (22%; quinapril vs p < 0.05) in the group were classified as NYHA class III. Both drugs had a positive effect on echocardiographic parameters. There was a statistically significant increase in exercise time in both treatment groups (quinapril, 6.2 +/- 1.8 versus 7.8 +/- 1.9 minutes, p < 0.001; captopril, 5.9 +/- 1.9 versus 7.1 +/- 2.3 minutes, p < 0.001). One patient in the quinapril group died suddenly during the study, and two patients in the captopril group dropped out due to persistent dry cough. No patients in the quinapril group reported adverse effects. Three patients in the captopril group suffered from moderately dry cough, one with taste blindness, and the other with unstable angina. The safety of the tested drugs has been confirmed by laboratory tests.

After DBP control was achieved, patients entered the 48-week maintenance period. During this time, the dose of study drug was fixed, but 12.5 mg or 25 mg of open-label HCTZ was added as needed to regain DBP control. At the end of the titration period, DBP control was achieved in 67% and 63% of patients with telmisartan and lisinopril in monotherapy, respectively. At the end of the maintenance period, supine DBP was controlled in 83% and 87% of telmisartan and lisinopril patients, respectively, and systolic blood pressure was controlled for DBP reductions of 23.8/16.6 mm Hg for telmisartan and 19.9/15.6 mmHg for lisinopril. .

157,10426836,Aspirin worsens exercise performance and pulmonary gas exchange in patients with heart failure receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Guazzi, M; Pontone, G; Agostoni, P","Pulmonary function abnormalities cause exercise disability in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Impaired pulmonary gas transfer is one of these abnormalities. Because angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are inhibited by cyclooxygenase blockade with aspirin, they improve diffusion for carbon monoxide and exercise capacity, an effect that appears to be mediated by prostaglandin activation. This suggests the possibility that aspirin may impair respiratory function and exercise ability in CHF, at least in patients taking ACE inhibitors. This study aimed to investigate this hypothesis; A daily dose of 325 mg aspirin for 8 weeks was given to 26 consecutive patients with primary dilated cardiomyopathy (New York Heart Association class II or III) with or without current outpatient antifailure therapy (group 1, 18 cases) (group 2). , 8 cases) an ACE inhibitor in addition to digoxin and furosemide. During the study, ACE inhibition was continued by giving enalapril 20 mg daily in group 1; Repeated testing at week 8 proved aspirin to be harmful in group 1. Exercise, resting carbon dioxide, peak exercise oxygen uptake (peak VO(2)), and tidal volume levels were decreased in this group; The ratio of exercise minute ventilation to carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO(2)) was increased and its variations were inversely proportional to peak VO(2). Similar results were not observed in Group 2; however, after this part of the study was completed and enalapril was included in the current therapeutic regimen, aspirin has an inhibitory effect on carbon dioxide, peak VO(2), peak tidal volume, and VE/VCO(2) at 1 L levels. became prominent and similar to that observed in group 1; Aspirin does not affect ventilation efficiency and peak VO(2) in CHF patients not taking ACE inhibitors, but worsens the ventilation response to exercise in the presence of inhibition of pulmonary diffusion for carbon monoxide, VO(2) and ACE. This may be the case in patients with CHF resulting from ischemic heart disease. Whether the same applies to smaller doses of aspirin was not investigated in this study.",0,0

Various etiological factors have been implicated, including drugs, total parenteral nutrition, sepsis, pregnancy, graft-versus-host disease, and systemic disorders such as sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and Hodgkin's disease. The pathogenesis of cholestasis is unclear and various mechanisms have been postulated without convincing evidence that any of them plays a role in clinical cholestasis. Despite uncertainty about the pathophysiology of intrahepatic cholestasis, various forms of therapy have been used.

The individual's risk of developing CVD is much greater when both diseases coexist, and is exacerbated by their frequent association with dyslipidemia, coagulation, platelet, and endothelial abnormalities. Metabolic abnormalities often associated with hypertension are insulin resistance, increased coagulation, and decreased fibrinolytic activity. Drug treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients is fraught with potential difficulties, such as changing the effectiveness of drugs, possible side effects, worsening of glycemic control and disruption of lipid metabolism.

The aim of this study was to determine the long-term effect of fish oil treatment on kidney progression in observations in a study cohort of 106 patients who exceeded the 2-year trial. Renal function was assessed by serial serum creatinine and 24-hour urine protein measurements. Vital, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and BP status and treatment beyond completion of the 2-year study were determined. As in the trial, the primary endpoint was a 50% or greater increase in serum creatinine and the secondary endpoint was ESRD. After a mean follow-up of 6.4 years, 46 patients-17 in the fish oil group versus 29 in the placebo group achieved the primary endpoint (P = 0.002) and 27 patients in the fish oil group – versus 19 out of eight patients. ESRD (P = 0.009) developed by the placebo group. At the end of the 2-year trial, 75 patients (45 fish oil, 30 placebo) were at risk for the primary endpoint. This also allowed doctors to discontinue supplements, switch patients assigned the original placebo to fish oil when the double-blind portion of the trial ended, and continue using fish oil in patients assigned the original fish oil. Significantly greater numbers of non-supplemented placebo patients improved the primary endpoint (P = 0.02) and ESRD (P = 0.003) compared to long-term fortified fish oil patients. Conversely, more fish oil-supplemented patients had more stable kidney function than non-supplemented patients (P = 0.02). For purposes, BP control treated primarily with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition was equal in the fish oil and placebo groups. Proteinuria was moderately decreased in both groups.

Relatively few one-to-one comparative studies have been published between fixed dose combinations and first-line monotherapies for hypertension. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of various first-line monotherapies and the fixed-dose amlodipine/benazepril combination. The results of the meta-analysis were used to compare the efficacy and safety of first-line monotherapies with amlodipine/benazepril. The meta-analysis included 82 studies involving 110 treatment groups (cohort). The study compared nine different monotherapy and one combination therapy (amlodipine/benazepril). Of the 82 studies, 22 were placebo-controlled and 60 were active treatment-controlled.

It ranged from 13.3 mm Hg. When studies were weighted by sample size, atenolol, verapamil, lisinopril and amlodipine/benazepril showed the greatest BP effects. When studies were weighted by variance, amlodipine/benazepril and atenolol showed the greatest BP effect. The percentage of patients controlled on treatment ranged from 54% to 79%. Lisinopril and amlodipine/benazepril showed the highest percentage controlled. The overall incidence of adverse effects ranged from 12.1% to 41.8%, with lisinopril having the lowest incidence and nifedipine the highest. The overall incidence of adverse events resulting in drug discontinuation ranges from 1.3% to 10.7%, with amlodipine/benazepril having the lowest incidence and nifedipine having the highest incidence. The results of the meta-analysis show that amlodipine/benazepril produces above-average reductions in blood pressure with a lower than average overall incidence of adverse events and the lowest incidence of adverse events resulting in drug discontinuation.

If sitDBP > or = 90 mmHg, at weeks 2 and 4 the dose was increased to 600 and 800 mg twice daily and enalapril to 20 and 40 mg daily. If blood pressure remained uncontrolled at week 6 at maximum doses of eprosartan or enalapril, HCTZ 25 mg od was added to the treatment regimen. At week 8, patients whose blood pressure was found to be medically acceptable by the investigator entered a 2-week maintenance phase at the last dose used in the titration phase. The primary measure of efficacy was the difference between treatments of the mean reduction from baseline in sitDBP at the end of the study. Eprosartan and enalapril caused a similar reduction in sitDBP at the study endpoint. The mean change in sitDBP at the end of the study for the eprosartan group was -20.1 mmHg and -16.2 mmHg for the enalapril group. However, eprosartan produced significantly greater reductions in both sitting and standing systolic blood pressure (sitSBP and staSBP, respectively) than enalapril. The mean decrease in sitSBP was 29.1 mmHg for eprosartan compared to 21.1 mmHg for enalapril (p = 0.025).

Older antihypertensive agents (reserpine, clonidine) have adverse effects on cognition; however, large clinical trials in the elderly indicate that commonly used agents [eg, thiazide diuretics, calcium antagonists (amiodipine, diltiazem), ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalapril) and beta-blockers (atenolol)] have minimal effects on cognition. Newer antidepressants, such as selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A, have not been shown to have adverse effects on cognition. Although some drugs have a low risk of causing cognitive impairment in research studies, the risk may be increased in frail older adults taking several medications and each case should be carefully reviewed. Identifying drug-induced cognitive impairment is crucial for early detection and resolution of symptoms. Preventive strategies to avoid high-risk drugs whenever possible, appropriate adjustment of doses for age-related changes, and close monitoring can prevent these situations.",0,0

175,10467219,"Safety and efficacy of eprosartan, a novel angiotensin II receptor blocker.",,"Shusterman, N H","Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been widely used in the management of hypertension and related cardiovascular conditions. However, this treatment approach is limited by the lack of specificity and the continued production of angiotensin II by other means. Antagonism of the angiotensin II receptor offers the possibility of better control of hypertension by providing a more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition without bradykinin-related effects. Eprosartan is the only clinically available non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole competitive angiotensin II receptor antagonist and is highly selective for the AT1 receptor subtype. In clinical studies, eprosartan has been shown to effectively lower blood pressure in a once-daily regimen in hypertensive patients. At the recommended dose range of 600 to 1200 mg once daily, eprosartan is effective in patients with all degrees of hypertension, regardless of age, gender, or race. In addition, the tolerability profile of eprosartan is comparable to that of placebo and there are no known clinically significant drug-drug interactions. A number of large-scale clinical trials are currently underway or are planned to determine which of the growing number of AT1 receptor antagonists can reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates in different groups of hypertensive patients. Meanwhile, current evidence indicates that AT1 receptor antagonists represent an important new approach to cardiovascular therapy and deserve a more comprehensive evaluation in hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.",0,0

The relationship between antioxidant status and HD was investigated by identifying oxidative stress markers and antioxidant defenses in a group of chronic HD patients (n = 33) and a group of same-aged controls (n = 29). The effect of a single HD session on these parameters was also evaluated. Before the HD session (pre-HD), HD patients had significantly lower red blood cell (RBC) glutathione (GSH), selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity (RBC-Se-GPx), plasma ubiquinol-10 and alpha-. more tocopherol than controls. In a randomly selected group of patients (n = 19), a single HD session resulted in an additional decrease in RBC-GSH and plasma ubiquinol-10 levels. Plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels were significantly higher in pre-HD patients than in controls. Plasma TBARS levels after HD were similar to control values. The +ACEi group of HD patients had higher pre-HD RBC-GSH content, RBC-Se-GPx activity, and plasma beta-carotene concentrations than the -ACEi patients (RBC-GSH: +ACEi, 3.1 +/- 0.9 micromol/mL packed RBC' s [PRBCs];-ACEi, 1.2 +/- 0.3 micromol/mL PRBCs [P < 0.05 v +ACEi]; RBC-Se-GPx: +ACEi, 5.8 +/- 0.7 U/ mL PRBCs; -ACEi, 4.3 +/- 0.2 U/mL PRBCs [P < 0.05 v +ACEi]; plasma beta-carotene: +ACEi, 0.54 +/- 0.16 micromol/L plasma; -ACEi , 0.19 +/-0.05 micromol/L plasma [P < 0.05 v +ACEi]).

In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1663 patients with severe heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35 percent who were treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive spironolactone 25 mg daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes; The trial was terminated prematurely after an average follow-up of 24 months, as an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was effective. There were 386 deaths (46 percent) in the placebo group and 284 deaths in the spironolactone group (35 percent; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P<0.001). This 30 percent reduction in risk of death in patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35 percent lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001).

The LV filling pattern was also similar in these 2 groups. Patients with low stress corrected MWS had higher atrial filling fraction, body mass index, heart rate, LV mass and concentric geometry than patients with stress corrected normal MWS. Atrial filling fraction was negatively associated with stress-corrected MWS, but not with EF in multivariate models, regardless of age, gender, heart rate, and body mass index.

However, the role of selected agents in the development of hypoglycemia is controversial. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of antihypertensive agents on the risk of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients receiving insulin or sulfonylurea therapy. A matched case-control study was conducted using Pennsylvania Medicaid data. Five control subjects, matched for sex and age, with no reported medical hypoglycaemia, were randomly selected for each case patient presenting for hypoglycemia in 1993, resulting in a total of 404 cases and 1375 controls. With these sample sizes, we were able to detect a 10% (P < 0.05) difference for hospitalization for hypoglycemia, our primary outcome. The relative risk of hypoglycemia was estimated using an unconditional logistic regression. The risk of hypoglycaemia was 5.5 times greater with insulin (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0 to 7.6) compared with sulfonylurea users and was generally unaffected by the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, use of the ACE inhibitor enalapril has been associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.3) in sulfonylurea users, suggesting that analyzing undesirable side effects from a class of drugs can sometimes mask the disease. . adverse effects of individual drugs. Use of beta-blockers was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia, providing further empirical evidence that beta-blockers are an appropriate treatment for people with co-existing diabetes and hypertension. Healthcare costs per capita were approximately 3 times higher in patients hospitalized for hypoglycemia compared to controls (P < 0.05). Hospitalization for hypoglycemia is expensive and can be avoided by appropriate monitoring of diabetic patients taking selected antihypertensive agents such as enalapril.",0,0

In diseases such as hypertension, blacks show pathophysiological differences and respond differently to certain treatments than whites. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical features and response to treatment in white patients and blacks with heart failure.; In the first Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT I), 180 black male patients and 450 white male patients were compared for baseline characteristics, prognosis, and response to treatment. In V-HeFT II, the same comparisons were made for 215 black and 574 white male patients, including an analysis classified by the presence or absence of a history of hypertension. In both studies, black patients had a lower incidence of coronary artery disease, a previous incidence of hypertension, and a higher cardiothoracic ratio (P < .05) than white patients. In V-HeFT II, plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly lower in blacks; plasma renin activity was lower only in blacks with a history of hypertension. In V-HeFT I, overall mortality or hospitalization for congestive heart failure was not different between blacks and whites in the placebo group. However, the mortality of black patients receiving hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate (HI) decreased in V (P = .04)-HeFT I, while white patients did not differ from placebo. In V-HeFT II, only white patients had a reduction in mortality from enalapril treatment compared to HI treatment (P = .02). Whites also showed evidence of greater blood pressure reduction and increased cardiac size regression in response to enalapril. When stratified by history of hypertension in V-HeFT II, only whites with a history of hypertension and higher renin levels showed a significant reduction in mortality with enalapril compared to HI treatment. Hospitalization rates did not differ between treatment groups in either study; Whites and blacks showed differences in cause, neurohormonal stimulation, and pharmacological response in heart failure. This retrospective analysis suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are particularly effective in whites and that the combination HI may be equally effective in blacks.

This dosage was changed 3 times to treat all patients with lower, higher, initial doses for 4 weeks each. Trough levels of neurohormones (atrial natriuretic peptide [ANP], brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] and norepinephrine) and enalaprilat were measured and ergospirometry was performed; Changes in enalapril dose and enalaprilat level were consistent in 82% of patients, indicating good compliance. After increasing enalapril to 40 mg daily, patients in the E10 group saw an increase in maximal oxygen consumption and a decrease in neurohormonal stimulation, while the opposite changes were observed in patients in the E20 and E40 groups after reducing enalapril to 10 mg daily.

Intra-patient comparison showed higher neurohormone levels and lower exercise capacity (ANP: 172 +/- 148 vs 139 +/- 122 pg/mL) when patients received enalapril 10 mg daily. , P <.01; BNP: 193 +/- 244 vs. 152 +/- 225 pg/mL, P < .005; norepinephrine: 4.2 +/- 2.2 vs 3.5 +/- 1.6 nmol/L, P <. 05; maximum oxygen consumption 22.0 +/- 4.4 vs 21.3 +/- 4.3 mL kg(-1).min(-1) P <.05). Similar differences were observed when these variables were compared, and patients had the lowest and highest trough levels of enalaprilat; High doses of enalapril resulted in an improvement in exercise capacity and a decrease in neurohumoral stimulation, while these parameters worsened after reduction of the enalapril dose. Therefore, patients with congestive heart failure may benefit from increased dosage of ACE inhibitors.",0,0

195,10503655,Etiology and mechanisms of drug-induced lupus.,,"Rubin, R L","Systemic rheumatic symptoms occur with very different frequencies as a side effect of long-term treatment with about 39 drugs currently in use. Diagnosis of drug-induced lupus (DIL) requires awareness of this chronic drug risk, as symptoms are non-specific, subjective, and variable. However, laboratory features and complete recovery after discontinuation of treatment are helpful in distinguishing drug-induced spontaneous lupus or other syndromes. Drug-induced lupus is likely mediated by reactive drug metabolites, not ingested drugs, and susceptibility to neutrophil-mediated oxidative conversion is a feature of the ten lupus-inducing drugs reported so far. DIL mechanisms modeled after drug hypersensitivity reactions are not supported experimentally and are inconsistent with the properties of DIL. However, several new lines of research using mouse models have opened up promising clues to the origin of autoreactive T cells and disease development in DIL.",0,0

Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), a balanced iv vasodilator, has been shown to elicit favorable hemodynamic and clinical effects in this cohort. A prospective randomized parallel group trial was conducted to evaluate acute, moderate, and chronic changes in hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and renal variables in response to PGE1, dobutamine, and placebo. Thirty patients with class III and IV heart failure and low cardiac index (mean 1.9 l/min/m2) two hours after oral medications, including high-dose enalapril, were included. 7-day infusion of PGE1 (16.5 +/- 5 ng/kg/min, 10 to 20 ng/kg/min, group A n = 10), dobutamine (4.5 +/- 1 microgram/kg/min, 2.5 range from 5 μg/kg/min, group B n = 10) or placebo (saline, group C n = 10), a central venous access line after gradual titration until intolerable side effects develop with PGE1 or a 20% increase implemented through While PGE1 was maintained at the 50% peak dose, it occurred on the cardiac index with dobutamine and was maintained at this dose throughout. Hemodynamic data were collected at baseline, at the highest doses, after 12 hours, and after 7 days. Among neurohumoral variables, plasma norepinephrine, large endothelin (Big ET) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were evaluated simultaneously using RIA methods. Renal plasma flow (with paraaminohippurate clearance) and glomerular filtration rate (with iothalamate clearance) were measured before and during the infusions (12 hours and 7 days later). At the peak dose and at 12 hours, significant decreases from baseline in mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance were observed, accompanied by an increase in cardiac output with both PGE1 and dobutamine. These changes were maintained for 7 days when levels of pulmonary vascular resistance decreased with both active drugs. Blood pressure did not change throughout, but PGE1 slightly increased heart rate at 12 hours. After 7 days, both PGE1 and dobutamine increased renal plasma flow, but only PGE1 significantly decreased the glomerular filtration fraction. Glomerular filtration rate did not change with either drug. PGE1 reduced ANP levels at 12 hours and dobutamine increased large ET levels at peak but reduced large ET levels at 7 days. Norepinephrine levels were not affected throughout. Except for a slight decrease in right atrial pressure after 7 days, placebo did not significantly change any measured variable. Taken together, these data suggest that treatment with PGE1 is as effective as low-dose dobutamine in improving cardiac performance and renal perfusion in advanced heart failure. More importantly, no deleterious neurohumoral counterregulation was observed with PGE1.",0,0

Combined felodipine-metoprolol therapy controlled blood pressure (diastolic < or =90 mm Hg 24 hours post-dose) in 72% of patients after 12 weeks, compared with 49% for enalapril and 30% for placebo. Dose adjustment was required in 38% of patients receiving the combination, 63% of patients receiving placebo, and 61% of patients treated with enalapril. The overall incidence of adverse events during felodipine-metoprolol treatment was 54.5%; The corresponding values for enalapril and placebo were 51.7% and 47.4%, respectively. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 18 patients treated with the combination, 10 patients receiving enalapril, and 12 patients receiving placebo. No significant changes in patients' well-being were observed in any of the three study groups. These results suggest that a fixed felodipine and metoprolol combination tablet allows to normalize blood pressure in a significantly larger fraction of patients than enalapril given alone. This enhanced efficacy is achieved without impairing tolerability. Therefore, the combination of fixed dose felodipine and metoprolol may be a valuable option to initiate antihypertensive therapy.",0,0

Drug-induced nocturnal hypotension in patients with chronic hypertension has been associated with collapse of heart failure and a decrease in cerebral flow. The authors examined the effects of a single dose and 4 weeks of treatment with different classes of antihypertensive drugs on ambulatory blood pressure (APP) in 10 patients with mild hypertension. Data were evaluated by polynomial analysis (Harvard Graphics 3).

With enalapril, amlodipine, and carvedilol, inter-subject variability contributed significantly to the overall variability in measurements (p-values from 0.05 to 0.01 versus zero), whereas with celiprolol this was not the case. Although beta blockers reduced daytime blood pressure similarly to an ACE inhibitor or calcium channel blocker, they did not lower nighttime blood pressure. These results were confirmed in an 8-week crossover study comparing enalapril 10 mg daily to celiprolol 200 mg daily in the same patient group. The authors (1) concluded that beta-blockers provide a more stable reduction in blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension who are less affected by the suppressive effects via the sympathetic nervous system; (2) Unlike ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, beta blockers do not cause nocturnal hypotension in this patient category; and (3) that the selective beta-blocker celiprolol may outperform the non-selective beta-blocker carvedilol in these respects.",0,0

The ACE genotype assigned by an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism is known to affect the potency of ACE inhibitors in various kidney diseases. The authors sought to explain whether the effect of ACE inhibitors on restenosis could be altered by the ACE genotype. A total of 126 patients were randomly and prospectively assigned to the control group and imidapril group. In the imidapril group, patients were given imidapril 5 mg daily for 3 to 6 months, starting 1 day before PTCA. Forty-six controls (65 vessels) and 32 imidapril patients (43 vessels) completed the study. The minimal lumen diameter before and after the procedure did not differ significantly between the three genotypes (II, ID and DD) in both the control and imidapril groups. Late lumen loss at follow-up was not associated with ACE genotype in the control group, but was significantly related in the imidapril group (II, 0.63+/- 0.19 mm; ID + DD, 1.12+/-0.14 mm, p < 0.05). Moreover, in the II genotype, imidapril significantly reduced the rate of late loss and restenosis as defined by most commonly used definitions.

Little information is available to estimate which patients are at highest risk for this complication; To measure specific clinical determinants of decline in renal function in CHF patients prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy; We analyzed data from the Left Ventricular Dysfunction Studies (SOLVD), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of enalapril for the treatment of CHF. There were 3379 patients randomly assigned to enalapril with a mean follow-up of 974 days and 3379 randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow-up of 967 days. Decreased renal function was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of >/=0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) from baseline. We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decline in renal function, including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline creatinine, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of hypertension, diabetes, and use of antiplatelets, diuretics. , and beta-blocker therapy; Patients randomly assigned to enalapril were 33% more likely to have decreased renal function than controls (P = .003). According to multivariate analysis, advanced age, diuretic therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function in both the placebo and enalapril groups, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective. Advancing age was associated with an increased risk of developing decreased renal function in both groups, but was significantly greater in the enalapril group (enalapril: hazard ratio [RR] 1.42 at 10 years, 95% CI for enalapril [CI] 1.32-1.52). placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25). Diuretic therapy was also associated with a higher risk of kidney function in the enalapril group (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.70-2.08) than in the placebo group (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09-1.66). Conversely, enalapril had a relative renoprotective effect (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13-1.53) compared to placebo (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.57-2.44) in patients with diabetes. A lower risk of renal failure was seen in both groups with beta-blocker therapy (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.85) and higher baseline ejection fraction (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.91-0.96) per 5% increase. ; The use of enalapril resulted in a 33% increased risk of decreased renal function in patients with CHF. Diuretic use and advanced age increased this risk. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of renal failure in all patients with CHF, but this risk was reduced in the enalapril group compared with the placebo group. beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective in all patients regardless of treatment.",1,0

Joint National Committee for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.",,"Singh, V; Christiana, J; Frishman, W H","Prevention and treatment of hypertension remain great challenges for clinicians around the world. The recently published Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI) uses evidence-based medicine to provide clinicians with guidelines to assist in the prevention, detection, and treatment of high blood pressure. including pharmacological approaches. Calcium antagonists are widely used for the treatment of hypertension, and the JNC-VI focuses on certain conditions in which calcium antagonists may be considered treatments of choice. Numerous calcium antagonists with various pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects are available. Several sustained-release formulations of these drugs are also available. In terms of blood pressure control, calcium antagonists are more effective as antihypertensive treatments in black patients than beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. Rate-reducing calcium antagonists can be used as an alternative to beta-blockers in patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension. Calcium antagonists can be used as an alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients with hypertension and concomitant diabetes mellitus and/or kidney disease. Some dihydropyridine calcium antagonists may be useful as alternatives to ACE inhibitors in patients with hypertension and systolic heart failure. Calcium antagonists appear to be extremely beneficial in patients with cyclosporine-induced hypertension and in patients with hypertension and concomitant Raynaud's phenomenon and/or migraine. Rate reducing agents can be used in patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias and hypertension. Clinicians should be aware of drug-drug interactions involving calcium antagonists, especially after recent problems with mibefradil. Although retrospective studies have caused controversy about the safety of calcium antagonists in patients with hypertension, recent prospective studies have not revealed any major safety concerns with these drugs.",0,0

In one trial, captopril had a comparable effect to diuretics or beta-blockers in terms of overall cardiovascular prevention, but slightly less effective at preventing strokes. (2) In studies involving hypertensive subjects over 65 years of age, some diuretics and beta-blockers reduced the risk of stroke, coronary events, heart failure, and death. In one trial, a diuretic was superior to a beta-blocker in preventive efficacy and side effects. Nitrendipine, along with other antihypertensive drugs, prevented strokes in one study. (3) In a study involving hypertensive diabetic patients, captopril and atenolol reduced the risk of stroke, heart failure, and worsening of retinal disease without preventing coronary events or death.

Joint Working Group.,,"Lewis, J B; Berl, T; Bain, R P; Rohde, R D; Lewis, E J","Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease in the United States. We performed a study to evaluate the effect of assigning different levels of blood pressure control on the course of type 1 diabetic nephropathy in patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. We also examined the long-term course of this well-characterized cohort of patients receiving ACE inhibitor therapy. One hundred and twenty-nine patients with type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy who had previously participated in Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition in the Diabetic Nephropathy Study and serum creatinine less than 4.0 mg/dL were randomly assigned to a mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) target of 92 mm Hg or greater little (group I) or 100 to 107 mm Hg (group II). Patients received varying doses of ramipril as the primary therapeutic antihypertensive agent. All patients were followed for at least 2 years. Outcomes included iothalamate clearance, 24-hour creatinine clearance, creatinine clearance estimated by the Cockcroft and Gault formula, and urinary protein excretion. The mean MAP difference between the groups at 24 months of follow-up was 6 mm Hg. The median clearance of iothalamate in group I was 62 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at baseline and 54 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at the end of the study, with a baseline value of 64 mL/min/1.73 m(2). 2) and final 58 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in group II.

Thirty-two percent of 126 patients achieved a final total protein excretion of less than 500 mg/24 hours. Patients in groups I and II had equivalent rates of adverse events. In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy, if defined as including reduced proteinuria, the MAP target for optimal renoprotection should be 92 mm Hg or less.

Since angiotensin II is known to stimulate the prosclerotic cytokine that converts growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), we hypothesized that the renoprotective effect might be due to inhibition of TGF-beta1 production. TGF-beta1 levels were measured in serum from patients in the captopril trial at baseline and at 6 months. TGF-beta1 analyzes were performed on all available patient sera. Analysis was made between the percent change in TGF-beta1 levels in the first 6 months and the percent change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over the next 2 years. TGF-beta1 levels increased by 11% (P = 0.003) in the placebo group (n = 24), while there was a 14% decrease (P = 0.01) in the captopril group (n = 34). There was an inverse correlation between the percent change in TGF-beta1 levels during the first 6 months and the percent change in GFR over the following 2 years in patients from both placebos (r = -0.55, P = 0.005). and captopril groups (r = -0.45, P = 0.008).

While there are many such agents, there can be some key differences between them. This placebo exercise, double-blind, crossover study using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring compares the efficacy of perindopril 4-8 mg and enalapril 10-20 mg once daily as antihypertensive agents in 32 patients. For diastolic blood pressure (DBP), perindopril had a placebo-adjusted peak (P) decrease of -6.4 +/- 1.3 mmHg and placebo-adjusted trough (T) -5.2 +/- 1.7 in placebo-adjusted blood pressure (BP) reduction. He had mmHg. . Enalapril had a reduction in DBP of -8.5 +/- 1.3 mmHg (P) and -5.7 +/- 1.7 mmHg (T).

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors improve autonomic function in patients with AMI, but the circadian pattern of this effect has not been studied. Heart rate variability-normalized frequency domain indices were evaluated 5 days after onset of uncomplicated AMI (baseline) and 30 days after treatment with quinapril (n = 30), metoprolol (n = 30), or placebo (n = 30). solid state digital Holter monitor. Normal subjects (n = 30) were used as controls. Quinapril increased parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic modulation and improved sympathovagal interactions, manifested by an increase in normalized high-frequency power (HFP) and a decrease in normalized low-frequency power (LFP), their ratio (LFP/HFP) over the entire 24-hour period (p< 0.001), rate (p<0.0001) 02:00 - 04:00, 08:00 - 11:00 and 19:00 - 22:00 (delta% ratio -30%, -32% and -% respectively) 26).

Two patients did not complete the study. At the end of each treatment, respiratory function, cardiopulmonary exercise test, plasma neurohormones, and quality of life were evaluated. Peak VO2 increased similarly (16% and 15%, respectively) and significantly (p < 0.01) compared to P+P, E+P, and L+P. Enalapril improved lung function (decreased ventilatory slope versus carbon dioxide production and dead space/tidal volume ratio and increased alveolar membrane conductivity and tidal volume). Losartan likely activated exerciser muscle perfusion (raising the delta VO2/delta work ratio, a measure of aerobic work efficiency). In combination, they increased peak VO2 by 10% (p <0.05) from E+P and 11% (p <0.05) from L+P.

After a 4-week washout period and a 4-week monotherapy period, P (4 mg/day), IND (2.5 mg/day), or HCT (25 mg/day) was added for 4 weeks. The choice of diuretic agent was random. After a 4-week washout period from the diuretic in which P-only was given, a further 4-week period of the alternative diuretic was administered. P significantly reduced blood pressure levels. However, the drug was more effective in patients with higher plasma renin activity (PRA). Combination therapy resulted in an additional reduction in blood pressure levels, especially in patients with low PRA. The combination of P + HCT was more effective than the combination of P + IND. Addition of HCT or IND resulted in a small but statistically significant increase in serum glucose levels both during fasting and 75 g oral glucose loading. However, insulin levels did not change significantly during the study. While small but not statistically significant changes in serum electrolytes and lipid parameters were observed at various stages of the study, a statistically significant increase in serum uric acid was noticed when the P + HCT combination was given. We conclude: (1) P is an effective and safe antihypertensive agent in small doses, (2) PRA has predictive value in determining the efficacy of P therapy, (3) the combination of P with HCT or IND in small doses is more than P alone (4) combination therapy has adverse effects on carbohydrate tolerance, however, there are no significant changes in serum electrolyte and lipid parameters.",0,0

Whether ACE inhibitor therapy alters immunological variables has not been previously investigated; Seventy-five patients (mean age 52+/- 11 years) with CHF were randomized in a double-blind study between low (5 mg daily) and high dose (40 mg daily) enalapril. Circulating immunological parameters (ie, proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules) were measured at baseline, week 10, and at study end (34 weeks); All immunological parameters except the soluble interleukin (IL)-6 receptor were increased in CHF compared with 21 healthy controls. During the study, immunoreactive IL-6 levels decreased during high dose (p < 0.05) and soluble IL-6 receptor increased (p < 0.05), but not during low dose enalapril therapy. Furthermore, IL-6 bioactivity was decreased only during the high dose (p < 0.001), resulting in a significant difference in change during treatment between the two dosage groups (p < 0.001). This reduction in IL-6 bioactivity was significantly associated with reduced interventricular septal thickness as assessed by echocardiography (r = 0.56, p = 0.013). No other variables changed during treatment.; In patients with severe CHF, high-dose enalapril therapy is associated with a significant reduction in IL-6 activity. However, despite treatment with a high-dose ACE inhibitor, these patients have persistent immune activation, which may be important for the progression of CHF.",0,0

The use of ACEIs in chronic heart failure gives us a unique opportunity to assess a patient's adherence to treatment by measuring whether the expected biochemical effect of an ACEI is present in the patient's bloodstream. In fact, there are several different ways to assess ACE in vivo: these are serum ACE activity itself, plasma N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP), urinary AcSDKP, plasma angiotensin I (AI), plasma angiotensin II. . (AII) or AII/AI ratio; Patients with chronic heart failure (n = 39) were randomized to ACEI non-compliance regimens for one week, ACEI compliance for one week, or two partial compliance regimens for one week, followed by the above six tests; All six tests significantly differentiated between complete non-compliance and full or partial compliance over the course of one week. Plasma-only AcSDKP produced a significantly different outcome between partial compliance and complete compliance or complete nonconformance over one week. In terms of their ability to distinguish between full adhesion and complete adhesion, plasma AcSDKP was 89% sensitive and 100% specific, with an area with an ROC of 0.95. The corresponding figures for urine AcSDKP are 92%, 97%, and 0.95%, and for serum ACE, 86%, 95%, and 0.90; All six tests distinguished complete non-compliance from all other forms of adherence.

According to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Critical Terms List, reactions were classified as serious or non-serious events. Drug consumption was expressed as daily defined dose (DDD)/1000 person/day; A total of 2224 adverse skin reaction reports (44.7% of all reported ADRs) were identified, accounting for a reporting rate of approximately 5.5 per 100,000 people per year. The female/male ratio was 1.58, and the reporting ratio increased with age.

Several studies have suggested that bradykinin (BK) is responsible for ACEi-induced AE, but the mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the metabolism of BK and des-Arg9-BK in the serum of 20 patients with a history of ACEi-related AE and 21 control (C) subjects. Synthetic BK was incubated with sera for various times and residual BK and produced des-Arg9-BK were quantified by specific and sensitive enzyme immunoassays. Half-life (t1/2) of both BK and des-Arg9-BK in the absence of ACEi could not be measured between C subjects and AE (AE) patients. However, an analysis according to prolonged (+) or absent (-) t1/2 of des-Arg9-BK allowed a new classification of C subjects and AE patients into four subgroups. Pre-incubation of sera with enalaprilat at a concentration that inhibits ACE significantly prevented the rapid degradation of BK and des-Arg9-BK in these four subgroups. In the presence of ACEi, there was a particularly significant increase in t1/2 of des-Arg9-BK in a subgroup (50%) of AE patients (AE+). Once ACE was inhibited, the concentration or nature of ACEi had no significant effect on t1/2 of des-Arg9-BK. However, a test dilution of AE + serum with a control (C) serum showed that an enzyme defect rather than a circulating inhibitor may be responsible for the abnormal metabolism of des-Arg9-BK when ACE is inhibited. In conclusion, half of patients with ACEi-related AE in serum had an enzyme defect involved in des-Arg9-BK metabolism that led to its accumulation. The B1 agonist may be responsible, at least in part, for the local inflammatory reaction associated with AE.",0,0

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to improve the altered fibrinolytic balance in hypertensive patients. However, it has not been documented whether this is due to a reduction in angiotensin II (Ang-II) formation or a result of high local bradykinin levels. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of an ACE inhibitor (perindopril) and an Ang-II receptor antagonist (losartan) on fibrinolytic kinetics. We have previously examined serum levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) antigen and activity, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen and activity, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). 9 years after reaching target blood pressure (<140/90 mm Hg) in 13 hypertensive patients (mean age 40+/-11 years, 6 women, 7 men) receiving perindopril and 12 patients (mean age 38+/-) receiving losartan, 6 women, 6 men). We also compared the baseline fibrinolytic activity of hypertensive patients with that of 12 normotensive control subjects (mean age 40+/-9 years, 6 females, 6 males). The mean baseline plasma levels of PAI-1 antigen, PAI-1 activity, and sTM were significantly higher in hypertensive patients than in normal controls (P<.005). Values of other analytes were similar in both groups. Increased plasma PAI-1 antigen levels, PAI-1 activity, and sTM decreased after perindopril and losartan were administered to patients (P<.005); reductions were more pronounced in the losartan group (P<.05). There was no significant effect on t-PA antigen, t-PA activity, and plasma levels of TFPI in patients receiving the two therapeutic regimens (P>.05). In conclusion, chronic hypertension is associated with hypofibrinolysis. The beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on fibrinolysis appears to be related to the blockade of Ang-II and increased quinine activity does not appear to play a significant role.",0,0

The deltaGFR (0.43 +/-0.05 vs. 1.73 vs. 0.48 +/-0.08 ml/min per m2) and the incidence of ESRD (23% and 22%, respectively) were comparable in male and female patients. However, compared to conventional therapy, ramipril reduced deltaGFR (-52% vs -19%) and progression to ESRD (-74% vs -40%) more effectively than in men. Thus, the relative risk (95% confidence interval [CI]) of events (ESRD) between conventional and ramipril therapy was 5.52 (1.59 to 19.17, P = 0.003) in women, but only 1.80 (1.08). to 2.97, P = 0.02). in men.

During the cold press test, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were lowered by ramipril, but the responses were not changed. However, heart rate responses were reduced. Thus ramipril reduced cardiac workload levels and responses during cold press testing as well. These findings suggest that ACE inhibitors can reduce cardiac workload in stressful situations.

One hundred and seventy-seven of the 642 RTRs were prescribed an ACEi or AT II antagonist. 47 patients discontinued treatment, the most common reasons for discontinuation being cough (8 patients) and hyperkalemia (6 patients). Mean arterial blood pressure at each follow-up period was lower than when ACEi or AT II antagonist therapy was initiated, with a decrease from 92 +/- 12 mm Hg to 86 +/- 9 mm Hg (P < 0.05) after 3 years of treatment. Serum creatinine concentrations did not change during the follow-up period. There was a discontinuous increase (P < 0.05) from baseline serum potassium of 4.4 +/- 0.5 to 4.6 +/- 0.6 mEq/L at 3 months, but no further increase in potassium beyond this time. The mean hemoglobin concentration for the cohort remained unchanged, but 13 RTRs given an ACEi for post-transplant erythrocytosis (PTE) decreased from 17.1 +/- 1.0 g/dL at the start of ACEi treatment in hemoglobin to 14.8 +/- 2.2 g/dL at 3 years (P < 0.05). ACEi and AT II antagonists were generally effective antihypertensives and were safe and well tolerated agents in this RTR cohort. ACEi was also effective in the treatment of PTE.",0,0

We measured coronary sinus blood flow and myocardial oxygen supply and consumption (MVO2), 1 microg/kg/min, in 12 patients with stable CAD, in sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing (30 beats/min above sinus rate), both at control and during NTG infusion. and NTG, 2 microg/kg/min. To examine metabolic coronary vasodilation, changes in myocardial oxygen supply were correlated with pacing-induced changes in MVO2 using standard regression analysis. The myocardial oxygen supply/consumption ratio (ie, the slope of the regression line in the control characterizing physiological metabolic coronary flow regulation) was compared with the ratios obtained during NTG infusion. Compared with control measurements, 1 µg/kg/min NTG and 2 µg/kg/min NTG reduced pacing-induced increases in MVO2 by 29% and 60%, respectively, while coronary blood flow during pacing remained unchanged. In control, normal metabolic regulation of coronary flow resulted in a myocardial oxygen supply/demand ratio of 1.39 (95% CI, 1.29-1.49). This ratio did not change during NTG, 1 microg/kg/min: 1.44 (95% CI, 1.33-1.56). However, during NTG, at 2 µg/kg/min, this ratio increased significantly to 1.84 (95% CI, 1.63-2.05; p<0.01). Intravenous administration of high-dose NTG, an exogenous NO donor, blunts pacing-induced increases in MVO2 and may increase metabolic coronary vasodilation in patients with CAD.",0,0

There are isolated case reports suggesting an association between erythroderma and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); To describe and characterize the prevalence, etiology and metabolic sequelae of erythroderma in HIV positive and negative patients. Clinicopathological correlation was performed in a subgroup of patients; One hundred and thirty-eight consecutive patients were prospectively recruited over a one-and-a-half year period at the skin clinic of King Edward VIII Hospital. Demographic, clinical, biochemical and histological data were recorded; Seventy-five percent of the patients were black, 22.5 percent Indian, and 2.5 percent white. The male/female ratio was 1.9:1. The mean age was 34.7 years (range, 1 month to 85 years). Forty-three percent of patients were HIV-positive, and 90% of them were black. In the total sample, the most common causes of erythroderma were atopic dermatitis (23.9%), psoriasis (23.9%), and drug reactions (22.5%). Drug reactions (40.6%) were the most common causes in the HIV-positive group, and ethambutol (30.8%) was the most common.

However, the effects of ACEi have not yet been studied in patients with a previous MI and preserved cardiac function. We examined the effects of 12 months of treatment with enalapril in patients with previous MI; Thirteen patients aged 70+/- 2 years with a previous MI and no overt congestive heart failure (CHF) were treated with enalapril for 12 months. We also included 13 age- and sex-matched control patients with a similar clinical history but not treated with enalapril. Holter electrocardiography and echocardiography were performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. Heart rate variability, low and high frequency powers (LF and HF), and the ratio between LF and HF (LF/HF) were analyzed.

Similarly, although antihypertensive therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of HF in hypertensive patients, how this benefit is achieved is unknown, and there is currently no clear evidence that any one class of antihypertensive agent is more effective than any other in this regard. respect. Theoretically, beta-blockers are expected to be ideal agents for the prevention of HF in hypertensive patients. In addition to control of blood pressure and regression of LVH, it has clear benefits on the prognosis of HF and morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction (MI), which probably plays an important role in the development of HF in hypertensive patients. A reduction in long-term mortality after MI has been shown only for non-selective beta-blockers. Carvedilol, a non-selective beta-blocker with a favorable metabolic profile and other ancillary properties such as alpha-1-receptor blockade and antioxidant effects, may be a suitable choice for the prevention of HF in hypertensive patients.

Because most of the original clinical trials for both cardiac drugs and psychotropic drugs did not include studies comparing these two drug areas simultaneously, their interactions often become known only through their combined use in the clinical field, using the patient as a ""guinea pig,"" and through subsequent reporting.",0,0
278,10665127,Efficacy and safety of telmisartan compared with enalapril in patients with severe hypertension.,,"Neutel, J M; Smith, D H; Reilly, P A","This 8-week, open-label study compared the efficacy and safety of telmisartan once daily given alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and amlodipine with a similar regimen of enalapril in patients with severe hypertension. Clinically significant reductions in supine systolic blood pressure/DBP have been observed with telmisartan (14.6/13.2 mmHg) and enalapril (13.0/12.9 mmHg) monotherapy. Increasing reductions were seen with increasing monotherapy (telmisartan 8.1/7.4 and enalapril 9.2/7.7 mmHg) and adding HCTZ (telmisartan 14.9/8.7 and enalapril 8.0/6.7 mmHg) and amlodipine (telmisartan 8.0/6.5 and enalapril). 10.5/6.4). After 8 weeks of treatment, supine DBP control was achieved in 55% and 35% of patients on the telmisartan and enalapril regimens, respectively. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated.

EMBATHE substudy with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.,,"Kohlmann JÃºnior, O; Jardim, P C; Oigman, W","double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study was conducted involving 34 centers from different Brazilian regions to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of trandolapril, an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, in the treatment of mild-to-moderate systemic arterial hypertension. Of the 262 patients enrolled in this study, 127 were treated with trandolapril 2 mg daily for 8 consecutive weeks, and the remaining 135 patients received placebo for the same duration. The decrease in blood pressure (BP) and the occurrence of adverse events during this period were evaluated in both groups. Significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic pressures were observed in patients treated with trandolapril compared to placebo. Antihypertensive efficacy was achieved with trandolapril in 57.5% of patients, and this was achieved in 42% of normal blood pressure values. The efficacy of trandolapril was similar in all centers, regardless of the region of the country. In a subgroup of 30 patients administered PACE, responders demonstrated a significant hypotensive effect for trandolapril during the 24-hour day. The adverse event profile was similar in both the trandolapril and placebo groups; Our results demonstrate for the first time the good efficacy and tolerability of trando-lapril during the treatment of mild to moderate essential systemic hypertension in a large cohort of hypertensive patients from different regions of Brazil.",1,0

Although these disorders have a significant impact on quality of life and represent an important underlying disease, they are often overlooked by the medical community. Patients may have difficulty recognizing odor versus taste disorder and often confuse the concepts of ""taste"" and ""taste"". The most common causes of olfactory disorder are nasal and sinus disease, upper respiratory tract infection, and head trauma, while common causes of taste impairment include mouth infections, intraoral appliances (eg, dentures), dental procedures, and Bell's palsy. Medications can interfere with smell and taste and should be reviewed in all patients for whom dysfunction is reported. Additionally, advancing age has been associated with a natural deterioration in the ability to smell and taste. A focused history and physical examination of the nose and mouth are usually sufficient to screen for underlying pathology. Computed tomographic scanning or magnetic resonance imaging of affected areas, as well as commercially available standard tests, may be useful in selected patients. Causes of olfactory dysfunction best suited to treatment include occlusive polyps or other masses (treated by excision) and inflammation (treated with steroids). Improving food flavor and appearance can improve quality of life in patients with irreversible dysfunction.",0,0

Anglo-Nordic Cardiac Outcome Trial.,,"Lim, P O; Donnan, P T; MacDonald, T M","Treated hypertensive subjects may remain five times more likely to die from heart and cerebrovascular disease than normotensive subjects with equivalent resting blood pressure (BP) levels. Research evidence shows that exercise blood pressure is a better predictor of end-organ damage and death rate than resting blood pressure, and data from our center shows that a significant proportion of hypertensives treated during the 5-minute Dundee Step Test had uncontrolled blood pressure. The prognostic benefit of exercise BP has not yet been translated into clinical practice due to the lack of an appropriate technique. The Dundee Step Test is being evaluated in the ASCOT (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcome Trial), a 5-year multicenter, multinational study comparing the effect of newer (amlodipine and perindopril) and older (bendroflumethiazide and atenolol) antihypertensive agents. It was classified according to cholesterol levels on cardiac outcome. If the Dundee Step Test proves to be of value, it may be adapted to routine clinical practice for the assessment of exercise BP. This may result in better management of hypertension with a subsequent reduction in morbidity and mortality.

Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation Study Investigators.,,,"Diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease. We investigated whether the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril could reduce these risks in patients with diabetes; Included in the Cardiac Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study, 3577 diabetic subjects aged 55 years or older, with a previous cardiovascular event or at least one other cardiovascular risk factor, without clinical proteinuria, heart failure, or low ejection fraction and without diabetes, received ACE inhibitors. Ramipril (10 mg/day) or placebo and vitamin E or placebo were randomly assigned according to a two-factor design. The combined primary outcome was myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. Overt nephropathy was the main outcome of one substudy; The study was stopped 6 months early (4.5 years) by the independent data safety and monitoring committee because of a consistent benefit of ramipril compared to placebo. Ramipril reduced the risk of combined primary outcome by 25% (95% CI 12-36, p=0.0004), the risk of myocardial infarction by 22% (6-36), the risk of stroke by 33% (10-50), and the risk of cardiovascular death by 37.

Forty-seven normotensive subjects were similarly evaluated as control subjects; In 296 hypertensive patients, FBF during reactive hyperemia was significantly lower than in normotensive subjects of the same age. The increase in FBF after sublingual NTG administration was similar in both groups. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and forearm vascular resistance were higher in the untreated group than in the four treated groups and did not differ according to the antihypertensive agent used. The maximum FBF response resulting from reactive hyperemia was significantly higher in the ACE inhibitor-treated group than in the calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, diuretic agents or nothing-treated group (40.5 +/- 5.2 vs. 32.9 +/- 5.8, 34.0 +/- 5.6, 32.1 +/- 5.9 and 31.9 +/- 5.8 ml/min per 100 ml tissue, p < 0.05, respectively. Reactive hyperemia was similar in the calcium antagonist, beta-blocker, diuretic, and untreated groups, and changes in FBF after sublingual NTG administration were similar in all groups. Infusion of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, abolished the increase in reactive hyperemia in hypertensive patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These findings suggest that ACE inhibitors increase reactive hyperemia, an index of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, in patients with essential hypertension.

His serum sodium was 109 mEq/L, serum osmolality was 225 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality was 414 mOsm/kg, and spot urine sodium was 122 mEq/L. Diclofenac 75 mg qd for osteoarthritic pain and lisinopril 10 mg qd for hypertension were started in 1990. Lisinopril was increased to 20 mg qd in August 1994 and to 20 mg twice daily in August 1996 to raise blood pressure; In July 1996 metoprolol 50 mg qd was added. A diagnosis of SIADH was assumed and further evaluation was performed to exclude thyroid and adrenal causes. After lisinopril was discontinued and the patient was limited to 1000 mL/d of fluid, serum sodium was gradually corrected to 143 mEq/L. The patient who took metoprolol alone due to hypertension was discharged; Serum sodium remained > or = 138 mEq/L 32 months after discharge until April 1999 despite daily use of diclofenac; Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors at antihypertensive doses can block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the peripheral circulation, but not in the brain. Increased circulating angiotensin I enters the brain and is converted to angiotensin II, which can stimulate thirst and stimulate the release of antidiuretic hormone from the hypothalamus, eventually leading to hyponatremia. SIADH should be considered as a rare but possible complication of treatment with lisinopril and other ACE inhibitors.",0,0

They were divided into three groups: low (PRA </= 1.5 ng/ml/h, n = 11); normal (1.5 < PRA < 5, n = 14); and high (PRA > 5, n = 13). The effect of ACE inhibition was then evaluated on diuretic-induced natriuresis based on renin status; There was no significant difference in age and gender distribution between the groups. Plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone increased serially from low renin groups to high renin groups, while 24-hour urine sodium concentrations decreased from low to high renin groups (low PRA, 96.7 (39.5); normal PRA, 90.4 (26.7); high PRA, 66.3) (18.9) mmol/l; p = 0.033), despite a higher dose of diuretics in the high renin group. This blunted natriuretic effect of loop diuretics was caused by RAAS activation, which was partially reversible by ACE inhibition. ACE inhibitors increased natriuresis by 22% in the high renin group (p = 0.029), but had no effect in the normal and low renin groups. Within the low renin group, five of the 11 patients had consistently low renin levels despite ACE inhibition. There was a non-significant decrease in natriuresis (-9.6%, p = 0.335) following ACE inhibition in this subset of patients; About one-third of the heart failure patients in our study had low renin status and unactivated RAAS despite diuretic therapy. ACE inhibitors did not significantly alter natriuresis in this subset of patients and increased natriuresis only in patients with high renin. Thus, there is tentative support for renin profiling in targeting those most deserving of ACE inhibitors, showing that short-term sodium retention does not occur in low-renin patients when ACE inhibitors are discontinued.",0,0

Using immunoblotting and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques, we showed that both human aorta and coronary artery VSM cell lines express PPARgamma protein and mRNA for both PPARgamma isoforms, PPARgamma1 and PPARgamma2. Immunocytochemical staining localized the PPARgamma protein mainly in the nucleus. Troglitazone dose-dependently inhibited basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor-BB-induced DNA synthesis and down-regulated growth factor-induced c-fos expression. Troglitazone also inhibited the migration of coronary artery VSM cells along the platelet-derived growth factor-BB concentration gradient. These findings demonstrate for the first time the expression and nuclear localization of PPARgamma in human coronary artery and aortic VSM cells.

The combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker may provide a higher degree of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system than either agent alone. Such enhanced suppression may be beneficial for patients who exhibit a progressive decline in kidney function due to chronic kidney disease; A pilot multinational, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, parallel group open-label study was conducted in a group of patients with progressive chronic renal failure (creatinine clearance 20-45 ml/min) or without proteinuria and hypertension. The primary aim of the study was to investigate the safety and tolerability of the combination of valsartan and benazepril. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: group 1 received valsartan 160 mg once daily (n = 22); group 2 received valsartan 80 mg once daily plus benazepril 5 or 10 mg once daily (n = 42); group 3 received 160 mg of valsartan once daily plus 5 or 10 mg of benazepril once daily (n = 44).

As a control, the efficacy of enalapril monotherapy (10 and 20 mg UID for 2 weeks each) was evaluated in a third series of patients (n=8). Amlodipine (5 mg UID) increased leg weight (percentage of decrease of skin blood flow from horizontal to dependent position) without altering postural vasoconstriction, indicating that extravascular fluid shift is independent of postural skin vasoconstriction. However, at 10 mg UID, amlodipine blunted postural vasoconstriction and further increased leg weight, suggesting that skin blood flow autoregulation limits additional fluid transfer. Both parameters returned to normal after discontinuation of the drug. Enalapril alone did not affect cutaneous vasomotion or leg weight, but reduced the amount of CCB-dependent fluid extravasation, despite a persistent antagonism to postural vasoconstrictor responses.",0,0

The researchers concluded that blood pressure was similar in both groups, but for the 5-year follow-up, only enalapril had a significant effect on maintaining reduced urinary albumin excretion. Although proteinuria is considered a surrogate of kidney disease progression, further studies will be required to confirm this hypothesis in ADPKD, as no differences in kidney function were observed between the enalapril and amlodipine groups after 5 years.

294,10694829,Does Chinese ethnicity affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors?,,"Ding, P Y; Hu, O Y; Pool, P E; Liao, W","Information from clinical and pharmacokinetic studies of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) has come from predominantly male and Caucasian subjects, but the use of ACEIs extends to populations worldwide. In terms of the pharmacokinetics/dynamics of other drug classes, significant differences have been shown between Chinese and white male in general, which may have implications for the use of ACEIs in the Chinese population. These include: significant Chinese/Caucasian genetic variation in the renin-angiotensin system based on an insertion/deletion (O/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene; Genetic determination of plasma ACE activity in the Chinese population; and genetic factors, including the disease substrate, which may also influence response to therapy. Oral and IV pharmacokinetic data from several studies in Chinese and Caucasian subjects are available for cilazapril, fosinopril and perindopril, and pharmacodynamic data is available for eight different ACEIs. Based on these data, there is little difference in the pharmacokinetics of ACEIs between Chinese and Caucasians. Most ACEIs showed good blood pressure lowering efficacy in Chinese (benazepril, enalapril, fosinopril, and spirapril); this is perhaps a less blood pressure lowering effect with cilazapril or a relatively shorter duration effect with cilazapril or perindopril compared to Caucasian. The Chinese experience more coughing from ACEIs (captopril and enalapril) than Caucasians. The data show that fosinopril may not cause cough in as many patients as other ACEIs, and this seems to be true for the Chinese as well. The currently unknown mechanism may involve the dual elimination pathway (liver and kidney) of fosinopril. Pharmacokinetic data also support the use of fosinopril in congestive heart failure where elimination pathways may be impaired. In conclusion, ethnic differences between Chinese and Caucasians in terms of ACE and AGT gene polymorphism, which might be expected to affect the effect of ACEIs differently in these two ethnic groups, actually have no such effect. Instead, the differences between ACEIs appear to be more significant. Journal of Human Hypertension (2000) 14, 163-170.",0,0

The effect on triglycerides (+22% - -8.5%) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-13% - +0.7%) also differed significantly between atenolol and trandolapril. After 8 weeks the results were similar. Glucose tolerance was not affected by either drug. Atenolol reduced diastolic blood pressure (DBP) better than trandolapril (-6.6 mm Hg versus -15.3 mm Hg for supine DBP after 48 weeks, P = 0.012). The difference in effect on insulin sensitivity between drugs corresponded to 25% of the baseline values of insulin sensitivity and was maintained throughout 48 weeks of treatment.

296,10696996,Angiotensin II receptor antagonists.,,"Burnier, M; Brunner, H R","Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system began as a way to study the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease with specific pharmacological probes. The oral activity achieved by shortening the original peptide structures turned the probes into therapeutic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, ACE is a non-specific target for blocking the renin-angiotensin enzymatic cascade. The availability of orally active drugs transformed ACE inhibition into a therapeutic breakthrough, but more specific blockade always seemed desirable. This goal has now been achieved with orally active angiotensin II receptor antagonists; six are on the market and more are in development. This new class of drugs is at least equivalent to ACE inhibitors in efficacy in hypertensive patients. Trials currently underway will show whether angiotensin II receptor antagonists can prevent target organ damage and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. If they do, these compounds could one day replace ACE inhibitors.",0,0

However, the effects of ACE inhibition on myocardial fatty acid metabolism have not been investigated in this patient population. We tested the hypothesis that ACE inhibitor therapy improves myocardial fatty acid metabolism and reduces mortality in patients after AMI; Forty-two patients were randomly assigned to either titrated oral enalapril (n = 24) or placebo treatment (n = 18) after initial anterior AMI and primary angioplasty. Iodine 123-labeled 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) single photon emission computed tomography imaging was performed mean 4.8 days after AMI and 1 month after AMI. BMIPP abnormalities were quantified as an index of severity with a polar map; There were no significant changes in baseline characteristics, cardiac function and angiographic findings between patients in the enalapril group and patients in the placebo group. However, the acute phase to chronic phase BMIPP severity index was significantly reduced in the enalapril-treated group (118+/-48 to 82+/-36, P<.05), but not in the placebo group (123+/-). 65 to 115+/-58, P not significant); ACE inhibition therapy improved myocardial fatty acid metabolism and regional left ventricular function in patients after anterior AMI.

After a 2-week placebo period, hypertensive patients (diastolic BP 95-115 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to either trandolapril 2 mg once daily or captopril 25 mg twice daily for 6 months. Trandolapril and captopril are packaged in electronic pill boxes equipped with a microprocessor that records the date and time of each opening (MEMS). Compliance of the patients was evaluated with both standard pill count and electronic monitoring. At the end of the placebo period and the treatment period, blood pressure was measured using an approved semi-automatic device. One hundred and sixty-two patients participated in the study. Concordance data can be evaluated for 133 patients (62 in the captopril group and 71 in the trandolapril group). Treatment groups were comparable at baseline, except for age (P = .046). When the electronic pill box was used, overall agreement was 98.9% in the trandolapril group and 97.5% in the captopril group (P = .002). The percentage of missed doses was 2.6% in the trandolapril group and 3.3% in the captopril group (P = .06). The percentage of delayed doses was 1.8% in the trandolapril group and 11.7% in the captopril group (P = .0001). The percentage of correct dosing periods, ie a period with only one correctly recorded aperture, was 94.0% in the trandolapril group and 78.1% in the captopril group (P = .0001). The results did not change when adjusted for age. At the end of the study, 41% of patients in the trandolapril group and 27% of patients in the captopril group (NS) had normalized blood pressure (systolic BP <140 and diastolic BP <90 mm Hg). In this 6-month study, the electronic pillbox allowed for refined analysis of the compliance of hypertensive patients. Patients' compliance with trandolapril once daily was higher than with captopril twice daily. The difference between groups is mainly explained by the increase in delayed doses in the twice-daily group.",0,0

Cognitive effects were assessed using tests of attention, visuospatial and verbal memory, learning, reasoning, planning, problem solving, speed, and coordination. The effect was evaluated using two different depression rating scales; Perindopril and diuretic had no adverse effect on various aspects of cognitive function. Mood improved on Perindopril, as assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory, and the error rate on the motor screening test was lower. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed that both drugs provided effective 24-hour control; The reliability of the longitudinal test/retest results, as well as the ease of use and the ability to adjust the test level to the needs of individual patients, indicate that CANTAB is an important addition to existing methods for measuring adverse central nervous system. drug effects. The other purpose of the study was to evaluate any adverse cognitive effects of perindopril against a drug HT believed to have no adverse central nervous system effects. In this context, perindopril did not show any side effects in all objective tests. In addition, there was a benefit seen in two independent assessments of depression (Hamilton and Beck rating scales).",0,0

To evaluate ACE inhibitor use in heart failure patients at a teaching hospital and differences between specialties, we examined all patients with an echocardiogram showing moderate or severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction at the Glasgow West Infirmary between 1 April and 1 October 1996 (n = 236). We found that most of the patients (66%) used ACE inhibitors, 12% were tried but had intolerance, 10% were not tried due to contraindications, and 12% were not tried despite the absence of contraindications. Of those treated, 58% were at the dose used in a large survival study (38% of all patients). Most patients were treated by a cardiologist (64%). More of these were using an ACE inhibitor (53% vs. 77%, p < 0.01), less were tried but found intolerant (18% vs. 11%), and fewer were never tried (29% vs. 11%, p < 0.01), regardless of whether they had contraindications (18% vs. 5%, p < 0.01) or not (6% vs. 12%). More were at the dose used in a large survival study (48% vs. 31%, p < 0.05). We conclude that despite improvements over time, ACE inhibitors are still underused, sometimes for no good reason.

The primary criterion for tolerability was the incidence of adverse experiences; Both valsartan and enalapril reduced mean SDBP and SSBP with similar efficacy regardless of altitude. Adverse events, regardless of relationship to trial drug, were reported by 12 (18.8%) patients receiving valsartan and 15 (23.4%) patients receiving enalapril. Enalapril was associated with a significantly (P<0.05) higher rate of dry cough and more headache episodes than valsartan; Valsartan 80 mg once daily is as effective as enalapril 20 mg once daily at lowering blood pressure, and the tolerability profile is at least as good as enalapril.",0,0

However, taste complaints are common side effects of many of these cardiovascular medications. Although clinical observations are helpful in identifying potential taste problems from a drug, experimental studies are necessary to obtain quantitative data on taste. In the studies performed here, nine cardiovascular drugs (labetalol HCl, captopril, diltiazem HCl, enalapril maleate, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol HCl, mexiletine HCl, procainamide HCl, and propafenone HCl) were administered to human volunteers to measure their direct effect on the tongue. These drugs were applied topically to the tongue surface of both young and old subjects to mimic the state in which the drug is secreted into the saliva. Detection thresholds ranged from 0.048 mM (propafenone) to 0.438 mM (procainamide). Detection thresholds of healthy older subjects were not significantly different from younger controls. The tested compounds had a predominantly bitter taste along with other attributes. In addition, topical application of drugs to the tongue affected the taste of one or more gustatory stimuli, with drugs differing in the pattern of taste effects exhibited. The mechanism of taste effects is not fully known, but the results of this study suggest that it may be due to the effect of drugs on peripheral taste receptors.",0,0

Different methods such as saline infusion, mannitol, furosemide, calcium channel blockers, atrial natriuretic factor and dopamine infusion have been used with varying success to prevent contrast-induced nephrotoxicity. The possible role of medullary ischemia mediated by the renin-angiotensin system in the formation of contrast-induced nephrotoxicity prompted us to investigate its role in inhibiting captopril (a sulfhydryl group containing an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor). 71 diabetes mellitus patients who underwent coronary angiography were included in the study. Patients randomized to receive captopril were given a dose of 25 mg three times a day for three days, starting one hour before angiography, while patients in the control group received routine angiography without captopril. Following angiography, patients in the control group developed a significant increase in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels compared to those receiving captopril. Contrast-induced nephrotoxicity (ie, a 0.5 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine) developed in 29% of the control group. Administration of captopril reduced the risk of developing contrast-induced nephrotoxicity by 79 percent. Glomerular filtration rate measured by Tc DTPA renal scan before and 24-72 hours after angiography showed a mean decrease of 9.6 ml/min in the control group, while those in the captopril group showed an average increase in glomerular filtration of 13 ml/min. ratio.

Post hoc analyzes of many ACEI-based clinical studies show the greatest slowdown in kidney disease progression in patients with the highest degree of renal impairment at study initiation. However, many physicians do not use ACEIs or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with kidney failure for fear of elevated serum creatinine or potassium levels; To determine whether limited initial reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or elevation in serum creatinine levels in association with the use of ACEIs or angiotensin receptor blockers results in long-term protection against decline in renal function in patients with renal impairment; We reviewed 12 randomized clinical trials evaluating the progression of kidney disease in patients with pre-existing renal failure. Six of these studies were multicenter, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, and the remainder were smaller randomized studies on renal function with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. These studies evaluated patients with and without diabetes or systolic heart failure. The mean follow-up for all studies was 3 years.

An inverse correlation was observed between the amount of renal function loss at baseline and the rate of subsequent annual decline in renal function following randomization to an ACEI-containing antihypertensive regimen; There is a strong association between acute increases of up to 30% in serum creatinine, which stabilizes within the first 2 months of ACEI therapy, and long-term preservation of renal function. This association is valid for people with creatinine values higher than 124 pmol/L (>1.4 mg/dL). Therefore, discontinuation of the ACEI in such patients should only occur when the creatinine increase exceeds 30% of baseline within the first 2 months after the initiation of the ACEI, or when hyperkalaemia develops, that is, when the serum potassium level is 5.6 mmol/L or higher.",0,0

Such patients tend to have pre-existing hemostatic defects that put them at additional risk of complications as a result of drug-induced thrombocytopenia. The clinical challenge is to ensure rapid identification and removal of the culprit agent before thrombosis results in the case of clinically significant bleeding or heparin.

321,10738847,"Drug-induced esophageal disorders: pathogenesis, incidence, prevention and management.",,"Jaspersen, D","Drug-induced injury to the esophagus is a common cause of esophageal complaints. 'Pill-induced' esophagitis is associated with the ingestion of certain drugs and accounts for many cases of erosive esophagitis. To date, more than 70 drugs have been reported to induce esophageal disorders. Antibacterials such as doxycycline, tetracycline and clindamycin are irritating agents in more than 50% of cases. Other commonly prescribed drugs that cause esophageal damage include aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), potassium chloride, ferrous sulfate, quinidine, alprenolol, and various steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. However, many physicians and even more patients are not aware of this problem. Capsules or tablets are often delayed in their passage through the esophagus. Very caustic coatings, direct drug injury, and inadequate esophageal clearance of pills can lead to acute inflammation. Esophageal injury occurs when the caustic content of a drug remains in the esophagus enough to form mucosal lesions. Taking medications at bedtime or without fluids is a common cause of esophagitis. The possibility of drug-induced damage should be suspected in all cases of esophagitis, chest pain, and dysphagia. History and gastrointestinal endoscopy will confirm the diagnosis. Although acid reduction is often used as an adjunct, treatment is supportive. This review reflects the current state of knowledge in this field.",0,0

It is still unclear whether these effects can also be achieved by blocking the angiotensin II (ATII) type 1 receptor; We randomized 201 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with direct angioplasty, thrombolysis, or heparin alone to either the ACE inhibitor captopril or the ATII antagonist losartan. Primary endpoints were safety, tolerability, and left ventricular parameters. The patients were followed for at least 15 days. The incidence of severe adverse events was similar in both groups, although cough was less common in the losartan group. Captopril failed to prevent an increase in end-diastolic volume and did not affect left ventricular end-systolic volume. This effect resulted in an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (P<0.01) without a change in wall motion index. Losartan did not affect end-diastolic volume but decreased end-systolic volume (P<0.001), resulting in a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (P<0.001) and a decrease in wall motion index (P<0.001); This study suggests that losartan is safe and well tolerated in patients after myocardial infarction.

However, the possible mechanisms of this improvement and the effects of such treatment on regional wall movement have not been determined yet. In a substudy of the carvedilol trial in patients with heart failure caused by ischemic heart disease in Australia-New Zealand, the effects of treatment on LV regional wall motion were evaluated using 2D echocardiography; 190 patients from 10 centers were included in this sub-study. Patients were randomly assigned to carvedilol or placebo treatment. Echocardiography was performed before randomization and after 6 and 12 months of treatment. LV regional wall motion was assessed using a semi-quantitative scoring system. The LV wall motion score index (WMSI) was reduced from 2.40 to 2.29 in the carvedilol group after 6 and 12 months and remained unchanged in the placebo group (2-tailed P = .005, carvedilol and placebo). The percentage of normally functioning myocardium also improved significantly with carvedilol treatment; Carvedilol improved LV regional WMSI in patients with heart failure caused by ischemic heart disease.

The creatinine clearance rate did not change significantly with either treatment during the study (ranging from 95.2 to 95.6 ml/min with rilmenidine and 86.2 to 90.4 ml/min with captopril). There was no statistical difference in changes in glycosylated hemoglobin levels for the rilmenidine and captopril-treated groups. Clinical and laboratory acceptability was good and those for the two groups were comparable; Rilmenidine exerts similar antihypertensive effects as captopril on hypertensive with type 2 diabetes. The reductions in microalbuminuria that occur with the two treatments are not different. It suggests that rilmenidine administration reduces microalbuminuria and may show nephroprotective effects.",0,0
340,10786260,Community pharmacist outreach program for physicians treating congestive heart failure.,,"Turner, C J; Parfrey, P; Ryan, K; Miller, R; Brown, A","The predictive value of digoxin and furosemide therapy in identifying patients treated for congestive heart failure (CHF), the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in this population, and the ability of a pharmacist outreach program to address underuse of ACE inhibitors were examined. Owners and managers of all community pharmacies on Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula were asked to participate in the study. Pharmacists who agreed to participate were asked to list patients from participating physicians who had a prescription for (1) furosemide and digoxin with and without an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor inhibitor, and (2) an ACE inhibitor. Physicians were visited by a pharmacist and asked to identify other cases of CHF among their patients taking digoxin and furosemide, and whether each of their patients had been treated for CHF and was taking an ACE inhibitor. Intervention group physicians received academic details on the use and dosage of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II-receptor inhibitors for CHF. Both groups were re-interviewed three months later to determine if there had been any change in treatment for each patient discussed at the first visit. The positive predictive value of digoxin and furosemide treatment in identifying patients receiving CHF treatment was 94%. Seventy-six percent of patients defined by doctors as CHF patients receiving digoxin and furosemide were treated with an ACE inhibitor. Thirty-six percent of patients treated with an ACE inhibitor for CHF received the targeted dose. Four physicians noted that outreach visitation affected their prescribing, but there was no significant difference in ACE inhibitor prescribing between the intervention and control groups. A pharmacist outreach program that included the use of prescription records and academic details did not affect prescribing or dosages of ACE inhibitors, but did show value as a quality assurance tool.",0,0

Only diuretics and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce this risk in long-term clinical studies. It is unknown whether newer antihypertensive agents reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD); To compare the effect of doxazosin, an alpha-blocker, with chlorthalidone, a diuretic, on the incidence of CVD in patients with hypertension as part of a study of 4 types of antihypertensive drugs: chlorthalidone, doxazosin, amlodipine, and lisinopril; A randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial, the Trial of Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatments to Prevent Heart Attack, began in February 1994. In January 2000, after an interim analysis, an independent data review committee recommended discontinuation of the doxazosin treatment arm. based on comparisons with chlorthalidone. Therefore, the outcome data presented here reflect follow-up to December 1999; A total of 625 centers in the United States and Canada; A total of 24,335 patients (age > or = 55 years) with hypertension and at least 1 other coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factor receiving doxazosin or chlorthalidone; Participants were randomly assigned to receive 12.5 to 25 mg/day (n=15,268) or doxazosin, 2 to 8 mg/day (n=9067) for a planned follow-up of 4 to 8 years. The primary outcome was fatal CHD or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) analyzed for intent to treat; secondary outcome measures included all-cause mortality, stroke, and combined CVD (CHD death, non-fatal MI, stroke, angina, coronary revascularization, congestive heart failure [CHF], and peripheral arterial disease); when compared with the chlorthalidone group and the doxazosin group; Median follow-up was 3.3 years. A total of 365 patients in the doxazosin group and 608 patients in the chlorthalidone group had either fatal CHD or non-fatal MI, and there was no difference in risk between the groups (relative risk [RR], 1.03; 95% CI [CI], 0.90-1.17). ;P=.71).

344,10798066,Evaluation and treatment of chronic renal failure.,,"Moudgil, A; Bagga, A","Chronic renal failure (CRF) is the irreversible deterioration of kidney function that gradually progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Major causes of CRF include obstructive uropathy, primary glomerular diseases, reflux nephropathy, and hypoplastic or dysplastic kidneys. Progressive hyperperfusion and hyperfiltration cause increased glomerular damage and further kidney damage. CRF symptoms are usually seen when the GFR is between 10-25% of normal. Children with severe CRF often suffer from growth retardation, growth retardation, acidosis, anemia, and renal osteodystrophy. The management of CRF aims to delay the progression of kidney damage and to treat complications related to renal dysfunction. Suggested measures to delay progression include protein restriction, tight control of hypertension, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and control of hyperlipidemia. Appropriate amount of protein and calories are recommended to prevent growth retardation. Nutritional supplements are often necessary. The availability of recombinant erythropoietin, calcitriol, and human growth hormone significantly improved the management of these patients. Once ESRD has resolved, chronic peritoneal or renal replacement therapy in the form of hemodialysis and transplantation is required.",0,0
345,10800878,The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril alters the clinical features of Parkinson's disease.,,"Reardon, K A; Mendelsohn, F A; Chai, S Y; Horne, M K","Animal studies have demonstrated an interaction between the angiotensin and dopaminergic systems within the striatum. In rats, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril crosses the blood brain barrier and increases striatal dopamine synthesis and release. In humans, angiotensin type 1 receptors have been found on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum. In Parkinson's disease, there is a marked reduction of these receptors associated with loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons; To investigate the effect of the ACE inhibitor perindopril on the clinical features of moderately severe Parkinson's disease, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover pilot study in seven patients. After a four-week treatment period with perindopril, patients had a faster onset of motor responses to L-dopa and a reduction in 'phase' peak dyskinesia, p=0.021 and p=0.014, respectively. Patients also reported more 'on' periods during the waking day in their movement diaries, p=0.007. Perindopril was well tolerated without any significant postural hypotension or renal dysfunction; These results suggest that ACE inhibitors such as perindopril may have a place in the management of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease and may justify further study.",0,0

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at rest and while performing mental arithmetic tests before and after the treatment with 10 mg/day fosinopril for 2 months. In addition, exercise stress testing was performed with the Bruce protocol before and after the treatment, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at rest and during peak exercise. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired t-test. During mental arithmetic testing, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced after 2 months of fosinopril treatment (p < 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were also significantly reduced during exercise stress testing (p < 0.005 and p < 0.05) after treatment.

Therefore, we set out to determine whether the effects of ACE inhibitors on prostaglandin production in essential hypertensive patients were due to class effects or ACE inhibitor nature. In addition, we investigated whether hypertensives showed an impaired capacity to synthesize vasodilator prostaglandins. To address these questions, we compared the effects of captopril (sulphhydryl-containing inhibitor), enalapril and ramipril (carboxyl-containing inhibitors), and fosinopril (phosphoryl-containing inhibitor) on blood pressure and urinary excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG). F1-alpha (degradation product of prostacyclin) in 44 mild-to-moderate essential hypertensive subjects before and 8 weeks after administration of an ACEI. We also examined prostacyclin excretion in 15 normotensive healthy controls. Urine 6-keto-PGF1-alpha (pg/ml) levels were measured by specific radioimmunoassay. Hypertensive subjects showed a lower excretion of 6-keto-PGF1-alpha than normotensive controls (212+/-147 vs. 353+/-98 pg/ml, p < 0.001). All ACEIs caused a significant decrease in MAP and increased the rate of excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite: C, 211+/-200 to 338+/-250 pg/ml, p < 0.05; E, 202+/-133 to 296+/-207 pg/ml, p < 0.05; R, 205+/-127 to 342+/-211 pg/ml, p < 0.05; F, 235+/-128 to 347+/-241 pg/ml, p < 0.05. In hypertensives (n = 44), the decrease in blood pressure was negatively correlated with an increase in 6-keto-PGF1-alpha excretion (r = -0.51, p < 0.001). These data suggest that impaired prostacyclin biosynthesis in hypertensive patients may be responsible for the hemodynamic changes leading to the hypertensive state. Furthermore, the hypotensive mechanisms of ACEI may be mediated by an increase in prostacyclin production; this effect appears to be class dependent.",0,0
348,10803861,"Losartan: a review of its use, with a particular focus on elderly patients.",,"Simpson, K L; McClellan, K J","Losartan is an orally active, non-peptide, selective angiotensin subtype 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist. It provides a more specific and complete blockade of the actions of angiotensin II than either renin or ACE inhibitors. Short-term (up to 12 weeks) clinical trials have shown that losartan is as effective in lowering blood pressure (BP) [causes blood pressure reduction] at doses recommended in elderly patients with hypertension. captopril, atenolol, enalapril, felodipine and nifedipine. The efficacy of losartan in patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) was similar to that of atenolol. Adding hydrochlorothiazide to losartan therapy provides greater antihypertensive efficacy equivalent to that seen with captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide. Preliminary evidence also indicates that losartan treatment contributes to regression of left ventricular hypertrophy associated with chronic hypertension. In patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic heart failure, losartan increases exercise capacity. Results from the Losartan Heart Failure Survival or ELITE II study show no statistically significant difference between losartan and captopril in reducing overall deaths or reducing sudden cardiac death and/or resuscitated cardiac arrest in patients. with heart failure. Apart from ELITE II, few definitive long-term mortality and morbidity data are available for losartan. Additional long-term studies are currently underway to evaluate the survival benefits of losartan in elderly patients with hypertension, kidney disease, or after acute myocardial infarction. In elderly patients with hypertension, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events associated with once-daily losartan (alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide) [19-27%] was similar to that of felodipine (23%) and nifedipine (21%), however, losartan was compared with captopril. tended to be better tolerated (16% vs. 11%). Losartan was also better tolerated than atenolol in ISH patients (10.4% vs. 23%). The renal tolerability of losartan in patients with heart failure was similar to that of captopril, but was associated with a lower withdrawal rate due to losartan adverse events. In the elderly or in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction, no dose adjustment is necessary and the risk of first dose hypotension is low; Comparative data have shown that losartan is as effective as other antihypertensive agents in the treatment of elderly patients with hypertension. Therefore, treatment with losartan is an option for first-line therapy in all patients with hypertension, particularly those who are not well-managed or intolerant to their current therapy. Morbidity and mortality data from the Losartan Heart Failure Survival (ELITE II) study indicate that losartan has potential in the treatment of heart failure.",0,0

However, the effect of the method and the use of normalized power units in long-term ECG monitoring are still debated. Autoregressive and Fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectral approaches were applied to evaluate the effect of circadian modulation and beta-blocker administration in mildly hypertensive patients (n = 44, 51 +/- 12 years, 30 men) with continuous ambulatory ECG recording. Spectral analysis was applied to the 5-minute sequences and spectral parameters representing each circadian period (24 hours, day, night) were calculated. In the basic recordings, the FFT spectral method provided a smaller estimate of the total and very low frequency powers. In contrast, the low and high frequency components were systematically larger with FFT. Circadian variations favored increased overall nocturnal variability but decreased low-frequency normalized power with both spectral methods. Chronic oral administration of the beta-blocker resulted in an increase in all spectral components except low-frequency normalized power, which did not change, regardless of the spectral approach. Despite the quantitative differences, the qualitative assessment of circadian patterns and beta-blocking effect with autoregressive and FFT-based spectral analyzes is equivalent.

Data were analyzed using ANOVA with repeated measures. Twenty-seven patients completed the study. Treatment with both losartan and enalapril was associated with a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in whole blood viscosity with a relatively high shear rate, indicating an increase in blood cell deformability. In patients receiving losartan, the increase in blood cell deformability did not result in a decrease in mean whole blood viscosity due to a concomitant significant increase in mean plasma viscosity (P < 0.01). In contrast, enhanced cell deformability in enalapril-treated patients resulted in a small and statistically insignificant decrease in mean whole blood viscosity (P = 0.06; mean change = -0.15 mPa sec). The mechanism of the increase in blood cell deformability and increase in plasma viscosity associated with losartan remains unclear. It is possible, but not proven, that the improvement in intrinsic blood cell rheology with losartan and enalapril may be the result of changes in cation transport systems and/or the protective antioxidant properties of drug metabolites.",0,0

Of the 191 patients entered, 183 completed the 8-week double-blind treatment. The mean age was 72-73 years. At the end of the placebo acclimation period, supine and standing blood pressures were 173/96 versus 168/96 mm Hg. BPs were measured in the morning, 20-25 hours after the previous day's dose (ie, at the end of the dosing interval). In the placebo group, supine and standing diastolic BP decreased by 3-4 mm Hg and systolic BP by 6-7 mm Hg. In the perindopril group, diastolic BP was reduced by 6-7 mm Hg and systolic BP by 10-13 mmHg (both P < 0.01 versus placebo). These data demonstrate a significant placebo response in elderly hypertensives, particularly systolic BP, and demonstrate the importance of a parallel placebo group for assessing the extent of action of the actual drug. Perindopril caused additional reductions in diastolic blood pressure of approximately 2 mm Hg and systolic blood pressure by 4-5 mm Hg. The extent of this drug effect may be less in middle-aged versus elderly hypertensives.",0,0

These false negative photopatch test results can be attributed to the drug's inability to penetrate the epidermis. In order to increase the penetration of the tested drug into the epidermis, some authors suggested breaking the cutaneous barrier. We conducted a prospective study comparing the photopatch and photocratch tests. Fifteen patients presenting with a systemic drug-induced photosensitivity were tested, as evidenced by a positive outcome after drug discontinuation. Photopatch and photoscratch tests were performed for each drug. Two-thirds of patients had negative photopatch and photo-scratch tests with suspected drugs. Photopatch and photocratch tests were positive and relevant in 3 and 4 patients, respectively. Photo scratch tests resulted in more false-positive results due to confirmed irritation in control subjects. Our study proves that photocratch tests do not change the sensitivity of the phototest.",0,0

Previous studies combining short-acting drugs from these classes required multiple dosing and were associated with poor compliance. The availability of longer-acting compounds allows once-daily administration to avoid the inconvenience of multiple daily dosing. It was decided to conduct a randomized, double-blind, crossover study with the long-acting calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the long-acting ACE inhibitor lisinopril given alone or in combination in essential hypertension. Twenty-four patients with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 104 mm Hg received amlodipine 2.5 mg and 5 mg, lisinopril 5 mg and 10 mg, and a combination thereof, according to a previous randomization schedule. Supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at weekly intervals. When the target supine DBP below 90 mm Hg was not achieved, higher doses of both drugs, individually or in combination, were used. There was a significant additive blood pressure lowering effect with the combination compared to either amlodipine or lisinopril alone. Five mg amlodipine and 10 mg lisinopril monotherapy achieved target blood pressure in 71% and 72% of patients, respectively. The combination of 2.5 mg amlodipine with 5 mg lisinopril resulted in a much more significant reduction in blood pressure in a higher percentage of patients compared to the individual lower dose.",0,0

Most reports did not provide either a definition of an ""additive"" nor the information necessary to determine whether the effects were additive. In this review of the medical literature, the effects of combination therapy were defined as additive if the sum of the mean reductions in BP following monotherapy with a CCB and an ACE inhibitor did not differ significantly from the mean reduction in BP of the combination therapy. Overall, the review showed that combination therapy was more effective than treatment with monotherapy alone, based on mean reductions in diastolic or systolic BP.

361,10826395,Practitioner's Trial on the Efficacy of Antihypertensive Therapy in Elderly Hypertension in Japan (PATE-Hypertension Study).,,"Ogihara, T","Patients aged 60 years and older with essential hypertension were treated for 3 years with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), delapril (Adecut), or manidipine (Calslot), a long-acting calcium (Ca)-antagonist. To investigate whether both classes of antihypertensive drugs are beneficial in elderly hypertensive patients, the incidence of cardiovascular events and drug-related adverse events were compared between the two groups. There was no significant difference in patient characteristics between the two intervention groups, except for slightly lower blood pressure (P = .08) in the Ca-antagonist group at study start. There was no significant difference in total mortality between the two groups. Cardiovascular events (both fatal and non-fatal) were recorded in 34 of 699 patients (22.5/1000 patient-years) in the ACE-I group and 50 (19.7/1000 patient-years) of 1049 patients in the Ca-antagonist group. No significant difference was found between the two groups. The correlation between cardiovascular incidence and blood pressure achieved during treatment showed a J-shaped phenomenon, suggesting that an extreme reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 120 mm Hg is unnecessary and may be harmful in some cases. Side effects were more frequent in the ACE-I group than in the Ca-antagonist group (P = .01). The main adverse event occurring in 5.0% of patients in the ACE-I group was cough. In conclusion, the study shows that both ACE-I (delapril) and Ca-antagonist (manidipine) are equally beneficial for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in elderly hypertensive patients. However, the tolerability of ACE-I was lower due to the cough side effect.",1,0

Women aged 40 to 69 years with an established diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95 to 115 mm Hg were randomized to candesartan cilexetil 8 to 16 mg (n = 140), enalapril 10 to 20 mg (n = 146). ) or HCTZ, 12.5 to 25 mg for 12 weeks (n = 143); Higher doses were used if DBP was greater than 90 mm Hg after 6 weeks. Candesartan cilexetil lowered sitting blood pressure by 17/11 and 19/11 mm Hg after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment, respectively. This reduction was greater than with enalapril (12/8 and 13/9 mm Hg) or HCTZ (12/7 and 13/8 mm Hg) (P < .01). The proportions of patients with controlled DBP (< 90 mm Hg) after 12 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil, enalapril, or HCTZ were 60%, 51%, and 43%, respectively. Patients experienced less dry cough (P < 0.001) with candesartan cilexetil or HCTZ compared with enalapril. Treatment differences were not found in the incidence of dizziness and quality of life was well maintained in all groups. Compared with candesartan cilexetil and enalapril, HCTZ increased uric acid and decreased serum potassium (P < .001). In conclusion, candesartan cilexetil reduced blood pressure more effectively and was better tolerated than enalapril or HCTZ in women with mild to moderate hypertension.",0,0

Treatment success was defined as maintaining a diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg for at least 1 year. We compared treatment success rates for control of blood pressure and adverse effects of placebo versus active therapy. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we also compared the rates of withdrawal from active drug therapy versus placebo over time due to adverse drug effects and blood pressure exceeding safety margins; At the end of the titration phase, 58 placebo-treated patients (31%) achieved a target diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg, and 57 patients (30%) achieved success at 1 year. Older white patients taking placebo had a success rate of 23% to 27% versus 38% for other age-race subgroups. Withdrawal rates as a result of adverse drug effects were 13% in patients receiving placebo versus 12% in patients receiving active therapy (P=.40). Withdrawal rates due to very high blood pressure were 14% in patients receiving placebo versus 7% in patients receiving active therapy (P=.01).

Elderly patients are more likely to have comorbid disorders such as dyslipidemia, diabetes, kidney disease, atherosclerosis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men. Therefore, when choosing an antihypertensive agent for elderly patients, it is particularly important to ensure that the treatment does not exacerbate comorbid conditions and does not interact harmfully with any medication the patient is taking. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist doxazosin has been shown to be an effective, well-tolerated antihypertensive therapy in elderly male patients and does not exacerbate and in some cases ameliorate some other common disorders. Doxazosin has been shown to be effective in reducing the symptoms of BPH in elderly patients whose blood pressure is well controlled with concomitant antihypertensive drugs. In addition, improvements in BPH symptoms and reductions in blood pressure were observed in older men with mild to moderate hypertension. Doxazosin has been shown to have positive effects on lipid profiles and glycemic control, making it an attractive treatment option for hypertension and elderly patients with diabetes or dyslipidemia. In addition, doxazosin is administered once daily, morning or evening, which can aid sleep, which is an important consideration in the elderly.",0,0
366,10830252,Risk-benefit ratio of angiotensin antagonists versus ACE inhibitors in end-stage renal disease.,,"Sica, D A; Gehr, T W; Fernandez, A","Effective treatment of hypertension is an extremely important consideration in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Almost any class of drug - with the exception of possible diuretics - can be used to treat hypertension in patients with ESRD. Despite such a wide range of treatment options, drugs that interrupt the renin-angiotensin axis are generally recommended as agents of choice in this population, although the evidence to support their preferential use is quite scant. ACE inhibitors, and more recently angiotensin antagonists, are the 2 most commonly used classes of drugs to alter the renin-angiotensin axis activity and thus produce blood pressure control. The use of ACE inhibitors in patients with ESRD can sometimes prove a definitive proposition. ACE inhibitors are dialyzed variably, with compounds such as cathopril, enalapril, lisinopril and perindopril undergoing substantial cross-dialysis clearance during a standard dialysis session. This phenomenon complicates dose selection and timing of administration for an ACE inhibitor in patients with ESRD. In addition, ACE inhibitors are recognized to have a number of non-suppressing effects in patients with ESRD. Such effects include their ability to reduce the thirst urge and reduce erythropoiesis. In addition, ACE inhibitors have a unique side-effect profile. As with patients without renal impairment, the use of ACE inhibitors in ESRD patients may be accompanied by cough and, less frequently, angioneurotic edema. In the ESRD population, ACE inhibitor use is also accompanied by reactions called anaphylactoid dialyzer reactions. Angiotensin antagonists are similar to ACE inhibitors in their blood pressure lowering mechanism. Angiotensin antagonists are not dialyzable and therefore distinguishable from a number of ACE inhibitors. In addition, the side-effect profile of angiotensin antagonists is remarkably mild, with cough and angioneurotic edema occurring rarely. In patients with ESRD, angiotensin antagonists are also not associated with anaphylactoid dialyzer reactions that occur with ACE inhibitors. The non-suppressing effects of angiotensin antagonists, such as an effect on the thirst urge and an effect on erythropoiesis, have not been studied almost as thoroughly as with ACE inhibitors. Although ACE inhibitors have not been directly compared to angiotensin antagonists in patients with ESRD, angiotensin antagonists have a number of pharmacokinetic and adverse effects that would support their use in this population.",0,0

In practice, however, it is unclear whether this influences the effects of ACEi on post-MI mortality and major morbidity; This overview sought individual patient data from all studies that included more than 1000 patients randomly assigned to receive ACEi or controls beginning in the acute phase of MI (0-36 hours post-onset) and continuing for four to six weeks.

372,10842896,The role of angiotensin II receptors and their antagonists in hypertension.,,"van Zwieten, P A","Octapeptide angiotensin II is the main effector of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Angiotensin II induces a variety of potentially harmful biological effects, including vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure, aldosterone release, potentiation of catecholamines, and vascular and myocardial hypertrophy, including remodeling of the heart after myocardial infarction. All of these deleterious effects of angiotensin II are mediated by the angiotensin II receptors (AT receptors) of the AT1 subtype. The functional effects of AT2 receptors characterized by biochemical techniques have not been clearly defined so far. Angiotensin II-mediated stimulation of the AT2 receptor is hypothesized to prevent vascular/myocardial remodeling and possibly induce vasodilation. Accordingly, AT1 and AT2 receptors are believed to cause opposite effects. He noted that fetal tissues contain high-density AT2 receptors, which are significantly reduced after birth. The identification and analysis of AT receptors has been greatly stimulated by the development of non-peptidergic AT1 receptor antagonists, the prototype of which is losartan. It is not yet clear whether AT receptors are activated in hypertensive disease. A study will be conducted on the hemodynamic effects of AT1 receptor antagonists, their interactions with AT receptors, and the possibly important role of the sympathetic nervous system involved in the antihypertensive effect of AT receptor antagonists.",0,0

(mean DeltaGFR 0.48 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.22 +/- 0.05 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/month; P = 0.0006; ESRD , 25% vs 10%; P = 0.004; RR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.38 to 7.32). Hypertension at study entry (P = 0.038), higher mean blood pressure at follow-up (P = 0.002) and urinary protein excretion rate (P = 0.0001) were independent predictors of faster DeltaGFR. DeltaGFR was approximately twice as fast in patients with type 2 diabetes than those with primary glomerular disease (P = 0.002; including immunoglobulin A [IgA] nephropathy, P = 0.009); nephrosclerosis (P = 0.03), adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD), or chronic interstitial nephritis (P = 0.006). Diabetes at study entry (P = 0.02) and higher mean blood pressure (P = 0.0001) and urinary protein excretion rate at follow-up (P = 0.0001) were independent predictors of faster DeltaGFR. After adjusting for baseline covariates, diabetes was also associated with an increased risk of progression to ESRD (RR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.01 to 5.68; P < 0.05). In multivariate analyses, ramipril decreased DeltaGFR (regression coefficient, -0.23 +/- 0.11 [SEM]; P = 0.036) and ESRD (RR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.57; P =) in patients with baseline proteinuria. 0.008) significantly decreased. The renoprotective effect was increased for 2 g/24 h or more of protein and increased proteinuria levels. Ramipril reduced DeltaGFR similarly in normotensive and hypertensive patients (-0.14 +/- 0.11 vs -0.14 +/- 0.09) and significantly limited ESRD in hypertensive patients (RR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.26 to 3.26; P = 0.004). DeltaGFR was decreased by 42% (P = 0.017) in primary glomerular disease, 35% in IgA nephropathy, and 37% in nephrosclerosis, but did not improve in type 2 diabetes, APKD, or interstitial nephritis. In multivariate analyses, ramipril significantly slowed DeltaGFR (-0.24 +/-0.08; P = 0.004) and progression to ESRD (RR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.36 to 3.96; P = 0.002) in patients without diabetes. but not in patients with diabetes who tended to have a faster DeltaGFR (+0.62 +/- 0.44) on ramipril therapy. In summary, patients with proteinuria of 2 g/24 hours or more, pre-existing hypertension or type 2 diabetes progressed more rapidly. Higher blood pressure and degree of proteinuria were the strongest predictors of faster GFR decline. The renoprotective effect of ramipril was similar in patients with normotension and hypertension. Hypertensive patients and those with proteinuria of 2 g/24 hours or more, primary glomerular disease or nephrosclerosis benefited most from ACE inhibitor therapy. During the study period, those with proteinuria less than 2 g/24 h of protein, type 2 diabetes or polycystic kidney disease did not significantly benefit from treatment.",0,0

The research focus of recent trials has now shifted from how to treat such patients rather than whether to treat them. Trials such as the Hypertension Optimal Treatment study have attempted to distinguish optimal targets for long-term blood pressure control. Despite failing this primary goal, they demonstrated the safety of reducing aggressive blood pressure to diastolic targets below 80 mmHg, as well as the safety and efficacy of a calcium entry blocker as a first-line antihypertensive approach. The Captopril Prevention Project study and the Swedish Trial in Elderly Patients with Hypertension-2 trial focused on whether the new agents (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium entry blockers) would have specific antiatherosclerotic advantages over conventional therapy in comparison studies with beta-blockers and diuretics. .

In patients with heart failure, the maximum pharmacodynamic effects are produced 6 to 8 hours after administration of the drug and last for 12 to 24 hours. In the Evaluation of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival (ATLAS) study, lisinopril at high doses (32.5 to 35 mg once daily) showed clinically significant advantages over low doses of the drug (2.5 to 5 mg once daily) in the treatment of congestive patients. heart failure. High doses of lisinopril were more effective than lower doses at reducing the risk of major clinical events in patients with heart failure treated for 39 to 58 months. Compared with those who received low doses, those who received lisinopril had an 8% lower risk of all-cause death (p = 0.128), a 12% lower risk of death or hospitalization from any cause (p = 0.002), and a 24% lower risk of heart failure. hospitalization (p = 0.002). These benefits were associated with significant cost savings. In short-term (usually 12 weeks) randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials, lisinopril was significantly more effective than placebo and was at least as effective as captopril, enalapril, digoxin, and irbesartan in improving symptomatic outcomes. score and clinical status in patients with heart failure. Lisinopril is generally well tolerated by patients with heart failure. In controlled clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions that occurred in recipients of the drug were dizziness, headache, hypotension, and diarrhea. Overall adverse event profiles were similar for patients treated with high or low doses of lisinopril in the ATLAS study. However, the high doses of lisinopril used in the ATLAS study were associated with a significantly higher incidence of adverse events such as hypotension and worsening renal function; however, these events were generally well managed by changing the dose of lisinopril or concomitant medications. Also, although the incidence of some adverse events was higher with high-dose lisinopril, the frequency of discontinuation due to side-effects was the same in the high- and low-dose groups; Lisinopril (when added to diuretics and/or digoxin) provides symptomatic benefits in patients with congestive heart failure. The ATLAS study demonstrated that high doses of lisinopril significantly reduced the risk of the combined morbidity and mortality endpoint compared to low doses of the drug. Importantly, there was no clinically significant reduction in the tolerability of the drug with high-dose use. Lisinopril is at least as effective as other members of the ACE inhibitor class in the treatment of congestive heart failure and is well tolerated.",0,0

A total of 4964 patients from 15 participating countries were included in the randomization phase of SCOPE, exceeding the target population of 4000. The mean age of patients at enrollment was 76 years, the ratio of male patients to female patients was approximately 1:2, and 52% of patients were already being treated with an antihypertensive agent at enrollment.

OPTIME-CHF is a randomized controlled trial comparing 48 hour infusion of Milrinone or standard therapy in 951 patients enrolled in the study over a 2-year period. Patients were excluded if the investigator believed their clinical condition warranted inotropic therapy. Patients were randomized within 48 hours of admission for acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure to receive either a 48-hour infusion of Milrinone or a placebo. Of the patients, 43% were diabetic, 70% were taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, 25% were already using beta-Blockers, and 34% had atrial fibrillation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of length of hospital stay, subsequent readmissions, and days spent in the hospital for the following 60 days at index acceptance. Subjective clinical evaluation scores were also not different. Both groups had an average acceptance rate per patient over the next year. However, there was a significant increase in the incidence of sustained hypotension in the Milrinone group, which was responsible for all of the increased adverse event rates for active therapy. The 60-day mortality was 10% in both groups. This and previous trials of the oral formulation of Milrinone have now clearly demonstrated a lack of benefit with Milrinone in both acute exacerbations and stable severe chronic heart failure [Packer M, Carver JR, Rodeheffer RJ et al.

The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare a continuous variable between subjects with positive MRA and subjects with negative MRA. Fisher's exact test was used to compare a discrete variable between subjects with positive MRA and subjects with negative MRA; The prevalence of RAS detected using MRA in 117 hypertensive type 2 diabetes patients was 17%; 19 subjects had unilateral RAS and only 1 subject had bilateral RAS. Subjects with positive MRA had significantly more common femoral impact than subjects with negative MRA (21% vs. 0%; Fisher's exact test P < 0.005); however, other clinical features of atherosclerotic disease were not statistically related. Longer duration of hypertension and treatment with statins were characteristics of subjects with RAS (P < 0.05).

Thirteen of 30 patients (4 with II genotype and 9 with ID and DD genotypes) were randomized to AHT (enalapril or metoprolol) during the study. The ACE genotype was determined by a polymerase chain reaction. Glomerular structural changes were measured by stereological methods; Eight of the patients had the II genotype, 19 had the ID genotype and 3 had the DD genotype.

394,10877041,Fluoroquinolone-induced renal failure.,,"Lomaestro, B M","Fluoroquinolones are generally well tolerated, clinically useful antimicrobials. This article highlights rare but potentially serious kidney-related side effects. It has long been known that other antimicrobials cause various forms of nephrotoxicity such as allergic interstitial nephritis, granulomatous interstitial nephritis, necrotizing vasculitis, allergic tubular nephritis or tubular necrosis. A Medline search (1985-May 1999) for ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, trovafloxacin, enoxacin, sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, gatifloxacin, clinafloxacin, and moxifloxacin was conducted to determine nefluoroquinrocinrocinrokinotoxic properties. Unfortunately, data consists primarily of case reports and temporally relevant events. The incidence of these side effects is difficult to estimate and the cause may be multifactorial. Although the use of ciprofloxacin appears to increase the risk, this may be due to its longer and more widespread use compared to newer agents.",0,0

Hypertensive patients underwent exercise testing and ambulatory BP was measured before and after treatment.; Office blood pressure of hypertensive patients was lower both in the untreated and after treatment in the health center compared to the hospital. The difference (systolic/diastolic (sd)) was 9.4/6.0 (7.4/2.7) mm Hg (P < 0.001 for systolic and diastolic BP) untreated. When treated, the corresponding figures were 5.4/4.0 (9.4/4.7) mm Hg, a significant difference (P < 0.001) in diastolic BP.

A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the perspective of the person funding the private sector health services. A predetermined protocol defined the study scope, comparators (candesartan, losartan, valsartan, and irbesartan), and inclusion criteria for peer-reviewed data. Data were extracted, statistically evaluated, and reported for clinical efficacy of comparators, measured as reduction in sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) (mmHg). The combinability of data from different clinical studies was confirmed using analyzes of variance. Combining these clinical results with South African retail prices and testing the results at a 95% confidence level, a pharmacoeconomic model was developed; Significant difference in clinical efficacy was found between comparators, with the following mean reductions in SDBP observed: candesartan 10.57, irbesartan 9.07, losartan 8.89, and valsartan 7.11 mmHg. Candesartan was found to be significantly more effective than losartan. Valsartan was found to be less effective than the other 3 comparators.

406,10902066,Angiotensin II-receptor antagonists: an overview.,,"Dina, R; Jafari, M","Angiotensin II (AT-II)-receptor antagonists are reviewed. Research focused on blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has led to the discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are effective in the treatment of hypertension but are associated with a high frequency of cough and other side effects. AT-II-receptor antagonists have been developed as agents that will block the RAS more completely, thereby reducing the side effects seen with ACE inhibitors. AT-II-receptor antagonists include losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, candesartan, eprosartan, telmisartan, and tasosartan. Several clinical studies have shown that AT-II-receptor antagonists are as effective as calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and produce fewer side effects. Side effects of AT-II-receptor antagonists - dizziness, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, cough and gastrointestinal disturbances - occur at approximately the same rate as placebo. [fixed]. All current AT-II-receptor antagonists appear to be equally effective at lowering both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and are comparable in cost.

This observation raised interesting possibilities regarding the pathogenesis of nephropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus. To determine whether the effect of captopril is indeed mediated by a reduction in angiotensin II (Ang II) formation, we performed another study using an Ang II antagonist, eprosartan, instead of captopril. Nine healthy subjects were studied at high sodium balance (ie, sodium intake 200 mmol/d). On the first day, subjects were given 600 mg of eprosartan orally, and renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured. Glucose was infused intravenously on the second and third study days to raise plasma glucose to a level below the glycosuria threshold (approximately 8.8 mmol/L). Eprosartan or placebo at a dose of 600 mg was randomly administered on the second or third study day 1 hour after initiation of the glucose infusion.

Eprosartan, in contrast, did not affect RPF and GFR in normoglycemic subjects. GFR was not affected by hyperglycemia or eprosartan. Neither plasma renin activity nor plasma Ang II concentration changed during hyperglycemia, suggesting that the hormonal responses responsible for the increased renal vasodilator response to eprosartan occur in the kidney. The increased renal vasodilatory effect of eprosartan during hyperglycemia is consistent with activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system.",0,0

Two hundred and twenty-nine hypertensive patients were randomized in a double-blind parallel group study. After a 3-week placebo period, they received either 2 mg of trandolapril or 50 mg of losartan once daily for 6 weeks. At the end of both the placebo and active treatment periods, three methods of blood pressure measurement were used: a) office blood pressure (three consecutive measurements); b) home self-measurements of blood pressure (SBPM), consisting of three consecutive measurements taken at home morning and evening for 7 consecutive days; and c) ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM), 24-hour BP recordings at three measurements per hour. Of 229 patients, 199 (87%) performed at least 12 valid SBPM measurements during both the placebo and treatment periods, while only 160 (70%) recorded good-quality 24-hour ABPM recordings in both periods (P < .0001). One hundred and forty patients applied the three measurement methods well. At baseline and at treatment, agreement between office measures and ABPM or SBPM was poor. Conversely, there was good agreement between ABPM and SBPM. The mean difference (SBP/DBP) between ABPM and SBPM was 4.6 +/- 10.4/3.5 +/- 7.1 and 3.5 +/- 10.0/4.0 +/- 7.0 at the end of the treatment period. The correlation between SBPM and ABPM, expressed by the r coefficient and P values, was 0.79/0.70 (< 0.001/< .0001) at baseline, 0.74/0.69 (0.0001/.0001) with active treatment. Hourly and 24-hour reproducibility of the blood pressure response was measured by the standard deviation of the BP response. Compared with office blood pressure, both the global and hourly SBPM responses exhibited a lower standard deviation. The hourly reproducibility of the SBPM response (10.8 mm Hg/6.9 mm Hg) was lower than the hourly repeatability of the ABPM response (15.6 mm Hg/11.9 mm Hg). As a result, SBPM was easier to perform than ABPM. While there was good agreement between these two methods, the agreement between SBPM or ABPM and office measurements was poor. As the hourly reproducibility of the SBPM response is better than the reproducibility of both hourly ABPM and office BP response, SBPM appears to be the most appropriate method for assessing residual antihypertensive effect.",0,0

Wedge pressure during cycling exercise was similar at baseline, but tended to be lower with quinapril (17 +/- 1 mm Hg) at 12 months than with placebo (24 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = 0.1673). Thus, quinapril prevented further progression and remodeling of asymptomatic LV dilatation after distant myocardial infarction, possibly due to attenuation of an exercise-induced increase in LV filling pressure.",0,0

These subjects were matched 1:3 with a group of 66 subjects treated with enalapril 20 mg daily. Case-control sampling was based on age (+/-5 years), gender, pre-treatment office blood pressure (+/-5 mmHg) and ambulatory blood pressure (+/-5 mmHg), and duration of treatment (+/-6 months). . An additional group of subjects who discontinued treatment with enalapril (n=18) or losartan (n=2) due to adverse events prior to the conduct of the follow-up study were not included in the analysis; Hydrochlorothiazide was added during follow-up in 10 subjects (45%) in the losartan group and 34 subjects (52%) in the enalapril group to optimize blood pressure control (office blood pressure <140 mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic).

Change in left ventricular mass over time was more closely related to change in ambulatory blood pressure than office blood pressure in both groups. Left ventricular inner diameter did not change with either drug. The endocardial shortening fraction, middle wall shortening fraction and Doppler indices of active diastolic relaxation did not change with either drug. None of the biochemical parameters showed any significant changes. Serum uric acid showed a slight and non-significant decrease in the losartan only group; In this case-control study, losartan and enalapril alone or in combination with a diuretic effectively and evenly lowered office and ambulatory blood pressure in uncomplicated patients with essential hypertension and resulted in a significant reduction in left ventricular mass during long-term treatment.

The negative genotype of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, including LVH. ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) reduce LVH, but little is known about the effects of ACEIs on LVH in RT patients with different insertion/deletion (I/D) genotypes of the ACE gene; We prospectively studied 57 stable nondiabetic RT patients with hypertension and echocardiographic LVH, as well as their functional graft for 69.5 +/- 5.6 months. Patients received lisinopril 10 mg/day randomly for 12 months (group A, N = 29; 5 were excluded because of reversible acute renal failure) or placebo (group B, N = 28). Echocardiography (M-mode, 2-D and color flow Doppler) was performed at baseline and 6 and 12 months later by the same investigator without prior knowledge of genetic typing.

Portal hemodynamics were determined before and after treatment (one using an ultrasonic duplex system). New Doppler portal indices were derived and portal vein kinetic pressure was estimated for the first time using data from the ultrasonic duplex system. 1) Short-term endoscopic sclerotherapy alone resulted in a significant increase in portal vein kinetic pressure, wall stress index and flow volume (P < 0.01), and a non-significant increase in the total portal circulation resistance index (P > 0.05) and a significantly reduced portal. vessel compliance and extensibility indices (P < 0.05); 2) Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors increased the maximum and mean portal velocities, portal flow volume, total portal circulation resistance index, and portal vein compliance and extensibility indices, thus significantly reducing portal vein kinetic pressure in group IV (P < 0.05).

All records were made by the same physician (IE); The mean 24-hour blood pressure was 138/92 mm Hg after 4 weeks of placebo treatment, 128/85 mm Hg after 4 weeks of active treatment in the clinical trial, and 136/87 mm Hg after a mean of 31 months of treatment. clinical application.

Individual comparison revealed that 6 of 19 patients had a higher mean 24-hour blood pressure after 4 weeks of active treatment in clinical practice after several months of treatment in clinical practice; In our study, the blood pressure that dropped significantly in the clinical trial was not permanent when followed in clinical practice. At follow-up, one-third of the patients had blood pressure values similar to those before active treatment. The reason for this is unclear, but inconsistent fit may play a role in the improvements' lack of durability.

In placebo-controlled studies, eprosartan achieved mean reductions in systolic systolic blood pressure from baseline of 6.3 to 15 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure 4.1 to 9.7 mm Hg in the sitting position. Response rates associated with 400 to 800 mg once-daily administration of eprosartan were approximately twice that given with placebo. Overall, eprosartan was well tolerated with a tolerability profile similar to placebo. In comparative studies in which the incidence of persistent dry cough was considered the primary endpoint, enalapril was several times more likely than eprosartan to induce this adverse event (the difference is statistically significant regardless of the trial population and definition of cough). In conclusion, the angiotensin II receptor antagonist eprosartan is a well tolerated and effective antihypertensive agent administered once or twice daily regardless of meals. Eprosartan has a low potential for serious adverse events and the drug has not been associated with clinically significant drug interactions. Unlike ACE inhibitors such as enalapril, eprosartan does not have a high tendency to cause persistent unproductive cough. Therefore, eprosartan represents a useful therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with hypertension.",0,0

It has been shown that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce the risk of coronary events in various patient groups and prevent the development of atherosclerosis in animal models. It has been hypothesized that the clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors may therefore be mediated by their effects on atherosclerosis; Six hundred and seventeen patients were randomized in equal proportions to ramipril (5-10 mg daily) or placebo. At baseline, two years and four years, carotid atherosclerosis was evaluated with B-mode ultrasound and left ventricular mass was evaluated with M-mode echocardiography; Blood pressure (BP) decreased on average 6 mm Hg systolic and 4 mm Hg diastolic in the ramipril group compared to the placebo group (p<0.001). There was no difference between groups in changes in common carotid artery wall thickness (p = 0.58) or carotid plaque (p = 0.93). Left ventricular mass index decreased by 3.8 g/m2 (4%) in the ramipril group compared to the placebo group (2p = 0.04); The results do not support the hypothesis that reduced atherosclerosis is responsible for the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on major coronary events. The benefits are more likely to result from other factors such as lower BP, decreased left ventricular mass, or reversal of endothelial dysfunction.",0,0

A dry, bothersome cough is the most common side effect of all angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. It has been firmly established that prostaglandins (PG) play a leading role in the occurrence of ACEI-related cough. The role of different doses of aspirin, the most widely used PG inhibitor, in ACEI cough modification has not yet been clarified. We identified non-smoker ACEI-related cough in 34 (9.7%) of 350 consecutive patients treated with ACEIs. Patients who had lung disease, were treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and refused to participate in the study were excluded from the study. Treatment was discontinued in the remaining 14 ACEI coughs (eight men, six women; mean age, 63 +/- 11 years); the dry cough disappeared completely, but returned within 1 week after reintroduction of the ACEI in all patients. At the end of the withdrawal period, patients started on low-dose aspirin for 1 week, then switched to intermediate-dose aspirin for another week. Cough severity (CS, 0-4) and frequency (CF, 0-10) scores were recorded at each visit. Low-dose aspirin was ineffective in suppressing ACEI-induced cough, while intermediate doses completely eliminated cough in five patients and reduced cough in all but one patient; CS and CF decreased from 2.5 +/- 1.0 to 0.9 +/- 1.1, P < .002 and 6.6 +/- 2.4 to 2.4 +/- 1.1, P < .0002, respectively. Overall, medium-dose aspirin beneficially altered cough scores in 13 (93%) patients, allowing nine (64%) to continue on ACEI therapy. Aspirin did not affect blood pressure control in neither hypertensive nor post-infarction patients. We conclude that aspirin at moderate, but not low, doses can possibly suppress ACEI-induced cough. These findings suggest a new alternative therapeutic approach, particularly for patients with ACEI-related cough who appear to require ACEI therapy.",0,0

Recent European guidelines point to a major gap in our knowledge of how to treat diastolic chronic heart failure, and a general lack of knowledge about the management of heart failure in the elderly. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the potential benefits of the ACE inhibitor perindopril for treating chronic heart failure in the elderly in the absence of any major left ventricular systolic dysfunction. One thousand people over the age of 70 will be included in this study. Evidence of chronic heart failure will be confirmed by clinical criteria and echocardiography; Once the diagnosis of chronic heart failure has been confirmed, the patient will receive either perindopril or placebo in addition to their usual treatment. Death and hospitalizations due to unplanned heart failure are the primary outcomes. Quality of life as measured by the Guyatt questionnaire will be assessed at the beginning of the study and at 1 year. Substudies of this study include the 6-minute walk test and a more detailed assessment of ventricular function (as assessed by echocardiography).

The study participation of 953 GPs allowed an estimate of the absolute cardiovascular risk for 1,243 hypertensives to be reached. Patients were randomized into 2 groups according to whether the calculated risk was known by the physicians or not. The therapeutic strategy included a monotherapy (Fosinopril 20 mg/day) for an 8-week follow-up with the possibility of increasing treatment (Fosinopril + hydrochlorothiazide) after 4 weeks. To be included, patients had to be older than 18 years old and less than 75 years old and had a blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg. Estimated and calculated cardiovascular risk at 10 years was classified according to the 1999 WHO-ISH guidelines: low risk < 15%, intermediate risk 15-20%, high risk 20-30%, very high risk > 30%.; In this population of 54% of men aged 60+/- 10 years, the agreement between estimated risk and calculated risk was 35%. This fit was better for 'low risk' and 'very high risk' but remains below 50%. Determinants of compliance were: gender (male), smoking and low HDL cholesterol. After 8 weeks of treatment, no difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of final blood pressure level, percentage of patients returning to normal, and number of patients undergoing dual therapy; General physicians' estimate of cardiovascular risk in 10-year hypertensive subjects is in poor agreement with the risk calculated according to the Framingham equation. The results of this study suggest that cardiovascular risk estimation of hypertensive subjects does not alter hypertension management.",0,0
451,10993857,Lisinopril-mediated regression of myocardial fibrosis in patients with hypertensive heart disease.,,"Brilla, C G; Funck, R C; Rupp, H","In arterial hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) includes myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis leading to LV diastolic dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, myocardial fibrosis regressed and LV diastolic function improved with treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril. Whether this applies to patients with hypertensive heart disease was discussed in this prospective, randomized, double-blind study; A total of 35 patients with primary hypertension, LVH, and LV diastolic dysfunction were treated with either lisinopril (n=18) or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; n=17). At baseline and 6 months later, LV catheterization by endomyocardial biopsy, early filling and Doppler echocardiography and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring were performed with measurements of LV peak flow velocities during the atrial contraction and isovolumic relaxation time. Myocardial fibrosis was measured by LV collagen volume fraction and myocardial hydroxyproline concentration. With lisinopril, the collagen volume fraction increased from 6.9%+/-0.6 to 6.3%+/-0.6% (P:<0.05) versus HCTZ and myocardial hydroxyproline concentration from 9.9+/-0.3 to 8.3+/- It fell to 0.4 microg/mg. LV dry weight (P:<0.00001 vs. HCTZ); this was an increase in the rate of premature filling and atrial contraction LV peak flow rate from 0.72+/-0.04 to 0.91+/-0.06 (P:<0.05 vs. HCTZ) and isovolumic was associated with a reduction in relaxation time from 123+/-. 9 to 81+/-5 ms (P:<0.000002 and HCTZ). Normalized blood pressure did not change significantly in either group. While LVH regression was not seen in patients treated with lisinopril, myocyte diameter was reduced from 22.1 ± 0.6 to 20.7 ± 0.7 microm with HCTZ (P:<0.01 versus lisinopril); In patients with hypertensive heart disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition by lisinopril may regress myocardial fibrosis independent of LVH regression and is accompanied by improved LV diastolic function.",0,0

There were 10 men and 5 women aged 4 to 56 years. Three patients had hypertension. Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in 8 of histological lesions; membranous glomerulonephritis in 3; Mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis in 2 patients and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 2 patients. Proteinuria ranged from 3.64 to 8.66 g/1.73 m2/day. Serum albumin ranged from 2.2 to 3.3 g/dl. Serum creatinine level increased > 1.5 mg/dl in 3 cases. After discontinuation of steroids, enalapril was started at a dose of 2.5 mg/day and was increased by 2.5 mg/day every 3-4 days until the maximum tolerated dose not exceeding 20 mg per day. Estimates of proteinuria, serum albumin, and serum creatinine were made every 4 weeks for six months and then every three months. The patients were followed for 6 to 30 months. Proteinuria decreased to <1.5 g/1.73 m2/day in 12 patients (80%) and <0.5 g/1.73 m2/day in 10 patients (66.7%) at 8 weeks. There was no significant reduction in proteinuria in 3 (20%) patients; two of these were FSGS and one was membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Edema, hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia returned to normal in all patients with reduction in proteinuria. There was no correlation between histological lesion and response to enalapril. There was no increase in serum creatinine level from baseline in any of the patients. No significant side effects were observed in one patient except cough. We concluded that enalapril is effective in reducing proteinuria and thus morbidity in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, regardless of the underlying pathology.",0,0

Noninvasive assessment of endothelial function in patients with risk factors undergoing clinical treatment is an important medical advance. In this setting, altered endothelial function in patients with coronary hypercholesterolaemia and its modifications by treatment with enalapril and simvastatin separately or in combination were evaluated in the brachial artery in a randomized, double-blind, 2-period crossover study; Thirty-eight patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 (18 patients, 3 women, mean age 63 +/- 6.0 years) received simvastatin 10 mg/day for 8 weeks and simvastatin plus enalapril 5 mg/day for an additional 8 weeks. Group 2 (20 patients, 3 women, mean age 64 +/- 5.8 years) received enalapril 5 mg/day for 8 weeks and enalapril plus simvastatin 10 mg/day for 8 weeks. Brachial artery diameters before and after postischemic hyperemia were measured by high resolution ultrasound in all subjects at baseline conditions (control) and under the influence of drugs at the end of 8 and 16 weeks; Cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were significantly reduced with simvastatin treatment alone or with enalapril.

This study was also a preliminary investigation of Z13752A pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK); In this randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential study, two alternative panels of eight healthy male volunteers each (six on active therapy + two on placebo) were treated with increasing oral doses of Z13752A: 10, 50, 200, and 600 mg panel I' e and 20, 100, 400, and 800 mg were given to panel II. The study was double-blind versus placebo or active therapy and was open to dose levels. The same volunteer received a placebo only once; Single oral doses of Z13752A as high as 800 mg have been well tolerated. Only six mild to moderate adverse events, mainly headache, were reported and were of little clinical significance. After administration of 200, 400, 600, and 800 mg of Z13752A, a non-significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure was detected in both the standing and supine positions. After single oral doses of Z13752A, ACE inhibition appeared to be significant at all doses tested, linearly related to dose, and nearly complete at doses > or = 100-200 mg. NEP inhibition was demonstrated by increased plasma concentrations of ANP and cGMP in almost all subjects. In the 200-800 mg dose range, Z13752A produced a 50-100% increase in plasma cGMP levels and a 50-80% increase in urinary cGMP concentrations. Detectable plasma Z13752A levels were found in all treated subjects. Z13752A was well and rapidly absorbed, reaching peak concentrations approximately 2.5 hours after administration.

In addition, two phase II clinical studies evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of telmisartan in mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients. Telmisartan was given to young men as a single oral (1-160 mg) or intravenous (10-160 mg) dose. In another multiple dose study, healthy young male subjects were administered telmisartan 320 mg orally once daily for 7 days. Elderly subjects took oral telmisartan (20 and 120 mg) once daily for 7 days. Telmisartan doses of 10, 20, 40, 80, 120, and 160 mg were received once daily for 7 days in mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients. Additionally, hypertensive subjects received oral telmisartan (40, 80, or 120 mg) once daily for 28 days. Following oral dosing, the median time to maximum plasma telmisartan concentration was 0.5 - 2 hours, with maximum plasma concentrations increasing disproportionately with dose. In contrast, plasma concentrations were directly related to intravenous dose. Steady state was observed 5-7 days after once-daily administration and there was no clinically significant accumulation at 28 days. Plasma concentration-time profiles were similar in all study groups and were characterized by rapid absorption and rapid biexponential decline after peak plasma concentration and a long terminal elimination phase (> 20 hours in healthy and hypertensive subjects). Telmisartan was well tolerated with a low incidence of drug-related adverse events. The most common event was headache, which also occurred in placebo-treated control subjects. No changes in heart rate, electrocardiograms, or clinical chemistry were detected after administration of telmisartan. Therefore, the study demonstrates that high well-tolerated systemic telmisartan levels can be achieved in healthy adults and hypertensive subjects of all ages. The long terminal elimination half-life makes telmisartan suitable for once-daily dosing and contributes to sustained efficacy over the full 24-hour dosing interval.",0,0

A number of clinical features were also recorded. The sensitivity and specificity of renal scintigraphy for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis was between 0.72 and 0.90 and that of the captopril-renin test between 0.77 and 0.91 and 0.69 to 0.75, depending on the criteria used. Clinical features were used to generate a clinical prediction rule for renal artery stenosis, with a sensitivity of 0.68 and a specificity of 0.87 at an estimated cut-off level of 30%. However, with the prediction rule, a precision of 0.90 can be achieved by performing arteriography only in patients with a probability of stenosis > or = 10%, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of arteriograms to be performed. A diagnostic strategy that begins with drug-resistant hypertension and continues renal arteriography only in patients with a high probability of stenosis is advocated. Patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis were then randomized to balloon angioplasty (n = 56) versus antihypertensive drug therapy (n = 50). Three months after randomization, balloon angioplasty was performed for the second time in 22 patients from the drug group. In an intent-to-treat analysis, although balloon angioplasty had a minor drug sparing effect, no difference in blood pressure was found between groups after 3 months or after 12 months of follow-up. The lack of beneficial effect of balloon angioplasty compared to medication cannot be attributed to the high rate of stenosis recurrence after angioplasty or to the fact that the inclusion criterion was set to a stenosis level of > or = 50%. Mild stenosis was also included. Renal function after angioplasty was slightly better in the angioplasty group than in the drug group, and recovery of the renal scintigram occurred more frequently after angioplasty. Besides treating patients with specific characteristics, the therapeutic approach presented begins with the extension of antihypertensive drug therapy to control blood pressure.

We investigated whether ACE inhibition improved endothelial function in such patients and compared the responses with those in healthy subjects; 23 healthy volunteers (controls, age 29.8 [SD 7.0] years) and 24 patients with type 1 diabetes (28.7 years [9, 6] years; HbA1c 8.1% [1.2]; duration of diabetes 13 .8 [2-30] years; blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg; 7 with microalbuminuria) after 5 weeks of ACE inhibition (quinapril, 10 mg day-1) and placebo in a randomized, double-blind crossover design. Estimates of the resulting endothelial function were made by flow-mediated vasodilation and plasma levels of endothelial-derived proteins; As predicted from measurements on placebo, patients with type 1 diabetes had some deterioration in endothelial function compared with controls: plasma tissue-type plasminogen activator levels were lower (3.5 vs. 5.4 ng mL(-1), P<0.05). ), but there were no significant differences in brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation or plasma levels of von Willebrand Factor, endothelin-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, soluble E-selectin, or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1.

Other endothelial markers were not changed during ACE inhibition; Normoalbuminara or normotensive type 1 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria have mild endothelial dysfunction. Short-term ACE inhibition improves endothelial function as reflected by a reduced sE-selectin in healthy subjects and normotensive type 1 diabetic patients. In healthy subjects, ACE inhibition increases flow-mediated vasodilation. Conversely, ACE inhibition does not affect flow-mediated vasodilation in type 1 diabetic patients.",0,0

No studies have evaluated the comparative effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor versus an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) on serum [K(+)] changes in subjects with renal impairment; The study was a multicenter, randomized, double-crossover design with each period lasting one month. A total of 35 people (21 men and 14 women, 19 African Americans and 16 Caucasians) with a mean age of 56 +/- 2 participated. The mean baseline serum [K(+)] was 4.4 +/- 0.1 mEq/L. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 65 +/- 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and blood pressure was 150 +/- 2/88 +/- 1 mm Hg. The main outcome measure was difference from baseline in serum [K+], plasma aldosterone, and GFR following baseline and crossover periods; For the total group, serum [K(+)] changes were not significantly different between lisinopril or valsartan treatments. The subgroup with GFR < or = 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and receiving lisinopril had significant increases in serum [K(+)] of 0.28 mEq/L above the mean baseline of 4.6 mEq/L showed (P = 0.04). This increase in serum [K(+)] was also accompanied by a decrease in plasma aldosterone (P = 0.003). Compared to the total group, the change in serum [K(+)] from baseline to posttreatment was higher in the lisinopril group in those with GFR values < or = 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). However, the lower GFR group receiving valsartan showed a smaller increase in serum [K(+)] 0.12 mEq/L above baseline (P = 0.1); A 43% lower value compared to those taking lisinopril. This blunted increase in [K(+)] in subjects receiving valsartan was not associated with a significant reduction in plasma aldosterone (P = 0.14).; In the presence of renal impairment, ARB valsartan did not raise serum [K(+)] to the same degree as the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. This differential effect on serum [K(+)] is associated with a relatively smaller reduction in plasma aldosterone by the ARB and is not related to changes in GFR. This study provides evidence that increases in serum [K(+)] are less likely with ARB therapy compared to ACE inhibitor therapy in persons with renal impairment.",0,0

474,11048472,Treatment of arterial hypertension in the elderly with diltiazem and ramipril.,,"Terranova, R; Luca, S","About 40% of the elderly population suffers from arterial hypertension. Therefore, effective antihypertensive therapy is required. Calcium antagonists are used to treat hypertension because, due to their mechanism of action, they can provoke systemic as well as coronary vasodilation. In this study, the authors aimed to evaluate the activity and tolerability of diltiazem compared with ramipril in a group of elderly patients suffering from essential arterial hypertension. A controlled single-blind study was conducted in which patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups, A and B, each of 25 patients treated with a single daily dose of 300 mg sustained-release diltiazem or 5 mg ramipril, respectively. The study lasted 6 months and evaluated systolic and diastolic pressure and heart rate; Evolution was positive in all patients in Group A and most patients in Group B with normalization of both systolic and diastolic values. Heart rate showed a more persistent decrease in group A, but this was expected due to diltiazem's mechanism of action. No patient in Group A had to suspend treatment, while one patient in Group B had to discontinue treatment following the onset of persistent cough. Both treatments resulted in similar changes in systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure. Based on these results, it can be confirmed that sustained-release diltiazem at an oral dose of 300 mg/day is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of mild to moderate essential arterial hypertension in the elderly.",0,0

476,11050792,Management of heart failure: evidence against practice. Does the current prescription provide optimal treatment for heart failure patients?,,"Hobbs, F D","Heart failure is an increasingly common and costly chronic disease with an increasing prevalence of at least 2% in populations over the age of 45, mortality rates as low as common solid cancers, and very high healthcare utilization costs. Despite growing evidence to support a range of effective interventions, predominantly therapeutic, there is significant physician underperformance in diagnosing and managing heart failure. Until the early 1990s, the treatment of heart failure was largely limited to the symptomatic treatment of patients with heart failure, which is well known for fluid overload. The introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has provided the first treatments that beneficially alter the prognosis of patients with the most common expression of heart failure, namely symptomatic or asymptomatic, established systolic dysfunction. Evidence has now extended these benefits to delaying the progression of heart failure and reducing hospitalizations. Much of our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure stems from these studies. More recent data have clarified the limited role of digoxin, the important benefits of beta-blockers and aldosterone blockers as adjuvant to ACE inhibition, and emerging evidence for angiotensin II antagonists. In contrast to these positive findings, there is reliable data from Europe and North America showing that primary care and hospital physicians are underperforming significantly in the diagnosis and management of heart failure, and that evidence-based therapies are underused and underdosed. Limited qualitative data suggest that the causes of this poor performance are complex and related to lack of access to objective testing of ventricular function and exaggerated concerns about treatment risks and side effects. Heart failure represents a complex set of etiologies and risks that are not easy to accurately define even in specialist settings. Now that there is strong evidence on how heart failure can be changed and improved, clear guidance is needed on which suspected patients should be referred, for advice on confirmation of the diagnosis and appropriate treatment regimens, and which patients can be primarily addressed in primary care. but with improved access to objective non-invasive testing to increase diagnostic reliability and classify patients for evidence-based treatments. The available evidence indicates that primary care physicians in North America and Europe today underperform in the management of patients with heart failure, often due to factors beyond their control.",0,0

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor has been consistently shown to result in an approximately 20% reduction in these risks. The development of angiotensin II receptor blockers offers a new, more specific and theoretically more complete pharmacological mode to inhibit the adverse action of angiotensin II; Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction (VALIANT) is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled parallel group study comparing the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment with valsartan, captopril and their combinations in post-MI high-risk patients. The trial was designed with 3 arms, giving equal statistical evaluation to survival comparisons of the combination of captopril with the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan plus captopril plus valsartan compared to a proven effective dose of captopril. This trial, involving 14,500 patients, was designed with a power of 86% to detect a 15% reduction in mortality with the use of valsartan compared to captopril. The trial promotes optimal individualization of other proven treatments in acute and chronic infarction, and the international patient organization ensures that multiple administration models are well represented; VALIANT is a major international research study to evaluate the role of valsartan in the management of patients with MI associated with heart failure and/or left ventricular dysfunction.

The three treatments produced similar reductions in supine systolic blood pressure. There was no significant difference in the risk of cardiovascular events between patients receiving conventional therapy and patients receiving newer therapies.

In addition, studies of the antihypertensive efficacy of drugs may be adversely affected by the fact that between 15% and 30% of enrolled patients are not hypertensive by ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurement. Therefore, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter parallel group study was conducted to compare the effect of nifedipine GITS (gastrointestinal therapeutic system) with enalapril; After a 2-week placebo adjustment period, 186 patients with a sitting diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 mmHg were enrolled for an 8-week treatment period. They took 30-60mg of nifedipine GITS or 5-10mg of enalapril. Diastolic BP similarly decreased from 99 to 87 mmHg (p < 0.01) in the nifedipine GITS group and from 100 to 88 mmHg (p < 0.01) in the enalapril group. However, the increase in BP 2 hours before awakening was significantly more suppressed by nifedipine. Furthermore, this study highlighted the presence of ""white coat"" hypertension in a few patients, particularly when using clinical BP to define hypertension. Of the patients who were defined as hypertensive by standardized BP measurement before randomization, 53 (28.5%) were defined as non-hypertensive by 24-hour BP monitoring.

Thus, the therapeutic effects of an AT1-R antagonist may be due in part to increased plasma angiotensin II levels that stimulate AT2-R. However, it is unknown whether AT2-R is expressed in the skeletal muscle vasculature of patients with severe CHF; Steady-state transcript levels of the AT1-R and AT2-R genes were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in RNA samples prepared from skeletal muscle of 12 patients with severe CHF (f1.gif"" BORDER=""0""> O(2)<10 mL.kg(-1).min(-1)) and 5 age-matched healthy subjects biopsied from vastus lateralis.

489,11078175,Effect of indomethacin on blood pressure in elderly subjects with essential hypertension well controlled with amlodipine or enalapril.,,"Morgan, T O; Anderson, A; Bertram, D","Arthritis and hypertension are common comorbidities in the elderly hypertensive population. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to relieve pain in patients with arthritis, but a side effect is sodium retention and consequent elevation of blood pressure (BP). The action of dihydropyridine calcium blocking drugs is relatively independent of sodium intake, whereas the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can be blunted by a high sodium diet. This study compared the effects of indomethacin with placebo in elderly patients with essential hypertension controlled with amlodipine or enalapril. Patients controlled with amlodipine or enalapril received either indomethacin 50 mg twice daily or placebo for 3 weeks in a double-blind crossover study. Response was assessed by ambulatory BP measurement. Indomethacin increased blood pressure and lowered pulse rates in patients receiving enalapril, but had little effect in patients receiving amlodipine. The difference caused by indomethacin between the two groups was a 10.1/4.9 mm Hg increase in blood pressure and a 5.6 bpm decrease in heart rate in those taking enalapril. Addition of indomethacin to patients receiving both drugs resulted in weight gain and a decrease in plasma renin. Its effect is assumed to be due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, which causes sodium retention. The decrease in plasma renin in patients receiving amlodipine improves the effect of sodium retention on BP. Plasma renin is decreased in patients receiving enalapril, but this is not translated into an effect due to blockade of the converting enzyme. Thus, the full effect of sodium retention on BP is expressed. In patients treated with indomethacin, fewer patients may respond to ACE inhibitors. However, the real problem is the patient taking indomethacin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs intermittently, which causes BP to spiral out of control if a person is treated with an ACE inhibitor.

This may be mediated by the angiotensin II and type 1 receptor or may be due to inhibition of kininase II and the protective effect of a bradykinin. Therefore, it is important to determine whether a type 1 receptor antagonist improves endothelial function; The effect of losartan (50 mg daily for four weeks) on endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilator function was determined in 9 NIDDM subjects using a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover protocol. Forearm blood flow was measured using strain gauge plethysmography; Losartan significantly reduced infused arm vascular resistance in response to a three-step intrabrachial dose of acetylcholine (p < 0.05, ANOVA). Forearm blood flow rate (flow from infused to non-infused arm) also increased (p < 0.01). Responses to sodium nitroprusside and monomethyl arginine were not significantly changed; Administration of 50 mg of Losartan daily improved endothelium-dependent dilation of resistance vessels in patients with NIDDM. That is, blockade of angiotensin II type 1 receptors improves endothelial function in NIDDM. At least some of the similarly beneficial effect of ACE inhibition is probably also mediated through the angiotensin II-type 1 receptor pathway. The use of a type 1 receptor antagonist appears to be a reasonable alternative to an ACE inhibitor to maintain endothelial function in NIDDM subjects.",0,0

Fifty of the patients were randomly assigned to the captopril group and 43 to the control group. In both groups, patients with lower AMI (66% vs. 72%, accordingly) and normal LV function (EF > or = 40% on ECHO) excelled in the study.

However, these differences in time between captopril and the control group were not significant in the consecutive control stages. The final result of the test (positive, negative, suspicious) did not differ significantly in both groups at consecutive examination stages. Captopril administered during the 1-year period after AMI slightly improved physical working capacity (accelerated recovery) and had no effect on ischemia during the predicted cycle ergometer test.

493,11081765,Renal effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade in heart failure.,,"Ruilope, L M; Barrios, V; Volpe, M","The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is actively involved in the dysregulation of kidney function since the early stages of heart failure (HF). Increased proximal tubular reabsorption and decreased sodium excretory capacity secondary to loss of renal functional reserve are the two most relevant initial changes in renal function in which angiotensin II has proven to act directly. Meanwhile, the octapeptide contributes to maintaining the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) within normal limits through efferent arteriole vasoconstriction. Administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARA) may be accompanied by a functional decrease in this parameter. Advanced age, higher baseline serum creatinine, history of hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation predict the onset of GFR impairment associated with blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Concomitant administration of beta-blockers may help preserve renal function and preliminary data suggest that the combination of ACEi and ARA is not accompanied by a higher kidney risk. The good prognostic effects of aldosterone antagonists in HF do not appear to be related to the intrarenal effects of these compounds, other than potassium loss and prevention of hypokalemia. Systematic therapeutic use of drug(s) with beneficial renal effects to treat arterial hypertension or myocardial ischemia may contribute to delaying or preventing the development of HF.",0,0

Both doses of calcium antagonist/ACE inhibitor combination therapy reduced diastolic pressure as much as the high dose and were significantly better than low dose calcium antagonist monotherapy (with nifedipine or amlodipine). However, 15% of patients in the nifedipine high-dose monotherapy group and 24% of patients in the amlodipine high-dose monotherapy group presented with some form of edema. In contrast, the incidence of edema was similar in patients treated with both combination therapy and low-dose calcium antagonists. Therefore, combination therapy with a calcium antagonist and an ACE inhibitor provides blood pressure control equal to high-dose calcium antagonist monotherapy, but with significantly less dose-related adverse experiences such as vasodilator edema.

The non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, including verapamil, reduces proteinuria similar to that of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), including trandolapril, but to a greater extent than other antihypertensives. Angiotensin (Ang) II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil, exert potent and long-term inhibitory effects against the progression of kidney damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether verapamil, trandolapril and candesartan cilexetil affect proteinuria and urinary podocytes in patients with IgA nephropathy. Thirty-two normotensive patients aged 18-54 years with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy, non-nephrotic proteinuria (1-3 g/day) and normal renal function (creatinine clearance >80 ml/min) were studied. Twenty patients with diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (non-IgA PGN) and 20 healthy controls were included in this study.

No urinary podocyte was detected in healthy controls. 32 patients with IgA nephropathy were randomly assigned to four treatment groups: those treated with verapamil (120 mg/day, n = 8); treated with trandolapril (2 mg/day, n = 8); treated with candesartan cilexetil (8 mg/day, n = 8) and given placebo (n = 8). The treatment continued for 3 months. The antiproteinuric response in the trandolapril group was similar to that in the candesartan cilexetil group (-38 vs -40%). The effect of trandolapril or candesartan cilexetil was greater than that of verapamil (p < 0.01). The reduction in urinary podocyte count from baseline was significantly greater in patients treated with trandolapril or candesartan cilexetil than in patients treated with verapamil (p < 0.01). However, there was no difference between patients treated with trandolapril and those treated with candesartan cilexetil. Proteinuria and urinary podocytes were not affected in the placebo group. These data suggest that urinary podocytes may be a marker of disease activity in adult patients with IgA nephropathy and that trandolapril and candesartan cilexetil are more effective than verapamil in reducing podocyte count.",0,0

We prospectively evaluated changes in blood pressure (BP), protein excretion, and renal function after 6 months of administration of the long-acting ACE inhibitor ramipril as monotherapy in 14 moderately hypertensive children aged 5-18 years with various nephropathies. Four patients had decreased glomerular filtration rate at baseline (GFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2). BP was assessed by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. After 2 weeks of treatment with oral ramipril (1.5 mg/m2 once daily), the mean values of systolic and diastolic 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure were reduced by more than 5 mmHg in nine patients. The dose was doubled in eight patients. At the end of the study, systolic BP was below the 95th percentile in 9 patients and diastolic BP in 13 patients. The night fall, which was initially reduced, has increased significantly. Of the 11 patients with increased albumin excretion (median 1.3 g/g creatinine), 6 responded to ramipril with a median reduction of 78% (range 24-83%), while 5 had increased albuminuria (median +19%). The GFR is well preserved and no other side effects of the drug have been recorded. The study shows that ramipril is an effective antihypertensive agent in children with renal hypertension. It is well tolerated even in mild renal impairment. In addition, the drug has a persistent antiproteinuric effect in about half of patients, which contributes to the preservation of kidney function.",0,0

Hypertension has been shown to carry an increased risk not only for cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality, but also for cognitive impairment and dementia. Although diastolic blood pressure is considered an important risk factor, it is now clear that isolated systolic hypertension and high pulse pressure also play an important role in the development of brain complications. Therefore, the treatment of these conditions must urgently become a common prevention tool. All randomized, placebo-controlled studies completed in the last 30 years have demonstrated a reduction in fatal and/or non-fatal strokes. In the most recent studies of isolated systolic hypertension in elderly patients, the benefit was even greater because of the higher risk in these populations. New classes of drugs, particularly calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, have been shown to be as effective as the diuretics and beta-blockers originally used. In the Syst-Eur trial, active therapy based on nitrendipine as a first step, possibly related to enalapril and/or hydrochlorthiazide, reduced not only stroke and cardiovascular complications, but also the incidence of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. This important finding should be confirmed by further research focusing specifically on the prevention of dementia. In addition, the importance of pulse pressure as a risk factor underscores the need for new drugs that can increase aortic dilatation and reduce systolic blood pressure without greatly lowering diastolic pressure. Improving hypertension management offers new opportunities to reduce age-related diseases and promote healthy aging in the elderly.",0,0

The mean difference in cost per patient was £397 lower in the high dose group [95% CI (high dose vs low dose) – £1263 to £43. Mean years of life per patient were 0.085 years higher in the high-dose group [95% CI (high-dose-low-dose) -0.0074 to 0.1706). Based on average costs and life years, high-dose therapy predominates, low-dose (less costly and more effective). Allowing uncertainty in average costs and life years, the probability that high-dose therapy would cost less than low-dose was 82%. If a decision maker is willing to pay at least £3600 per life year gained, there is a 92% probability that the higher dose will be more cost effective; The ATLAS Study has shown that treatment of heart failure with high doses of lisinopril is more likely to be more cost-effective than low-dose therapy.",1,0
512,11115082,ACEI/ATRA treatment reduces proteinuria by improving glomerular permselectivity in IgA nephritis.,,"Woo, K T; Lau, Y K; Wong, K S; Chiang, G S","It has been hypothesized that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor antagonist (ACEI/ATRA) may reduce proteinuria by its effect on the glomerular basement membrane in patients with glomerulonephritis. Therefore, we examined the relationship between the response of patients with IgA nephritis (IgAN) to ACEI/ATRA treatment by reducing proteinuria and its effect on the selectivity index (SI) in these patients. Forty-one patients with biopsy-proven IgAN entered a control trial, with 21 in the treatment group and 20 in the control group. Entry criteria included proteinuria of 1 g or more and/or renal failure. Patients in the treatment group received ACEI/ATRA or both in three-month increments in dose. In the control group, hypertension was treated with atenolol, hydralazine or methyldopa. The following tests were performed at quarterly intervals: serum creatinine, total urine protein, SI, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and low molecular weight (LMW) proteinuria; After a mean treatment period of 13 +/- 5 months, there were no significant changes in serum creatinine, proteinuria, or SI in the treatment group, but decreased from 1.8 +/- 0.8 to 2.3 in the control group. +/- 1.1 mg/dL (P < 0.05). Of the 21 patients in the treatment group, 10 responded (responders) to ACEI/ATRA therapy, which was determined as a 30% reduction in proteinuria, and the other 11 were non-responders (non-responders). Among responders, the SI improved from a mean of 0.26 +/- 0.07 to 0.18 +/- 0.07 (P < 0.001), indicating a trend towards selective proteinuria. This was associated with an improvement in serum creatinine from an average of 1.7 +/- 0.6 to 1.5 +/- 0.6 mg/dL (P < 0.02) and a reduction in proteinuria from an average of 2.3 +/- 1.1 to 0.7 +/- 0.5 . g/day (P < 0.01). After treatment, proteinuria in the treatment group (1.8 +/- 1.6 g/day) was significantly less than in the control group (2.9 +/- 1.8 g/day, P < 0.05). The post-treatment SI in the responder group (0.18 +/- 0.07) was better than the non-responder (0.33 +/- 0.11, P < 0.002). Eight of 21 patients with documented renal impairment in the treatment group had improved renal function compared with two patients in the control group (chi2 = 4.4, P < 0.05). Three of eight patients in the treatment group who had improved kidney function normalized their kidney function compared with one patient in the control group; Our data suggest that ACEI/ATRA therapy may be beneficial in IgAN patients with renal impairment and non-selective proteinuria, as such patients may respond to treatment with improved protein selectivity, decreased proteinuria, and improved renal function. ACEI/ATRA treatment probably changes the pore size distribution by reducing the radius of large non-selective pores, making the shunt pathway less prominent, resulting in less protein leaking into the urine.",0,0
513,11115412,"Losartan, an angiotensin type I receptor antagonist, improves duct vessel endothelial function in Type II diabetes.",,"Cheetham, C; O'Driscoll, G; Stanton, K; Taylor, R; Green, D","We have previously shown that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by enalapril and angiotensin II blockade with losartan improve acetylcholine-dependent endothelial function in the resistance vessels of patients with Type II diabetes. Therefore, it was of interest to examine the effect of losartan on conduit vessel function in this group. The effect of losartan (50 mg daily for 4 weeks) on endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilator function was determined in 12 subjects with Type II diabetes using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover protocol. Conduit vessel endothelial function was assessed using high resolution ultrasound and brachial artery response to reactive hyperemia (flow-mediated dilatation; FMD); Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) was used as an endothelium-dependent dilator. Losartan administration significantly increased the FMD response from 5.2%+/-0.7% (mean+/-SEM) to 7.4%+/-0.6% of vessel diameter (P<0.05; paired t-test). Losartan had no effect on endothelium-independent responses to GTN (17.8%+/-1.8 to 17.6%+/-1.2%). Consistent with our previous findings in resistance vessels, administration of 50 mg of losartan daily improves NO-mediated dilation of duct vessels in subjects with Type II diabetes. With the findings that both ACE inhibition and angiotensin II blockade improve resistance vessel function in this group, it is likely that at least some of the beneficial effect is via the angiotensin II/type I receptor pathway. A type I receptor antagonist appears to be a reasonable alternative to an ACE inhibitor for maintaining duct vessel endothelial function in Type II diabetic subjects.",0,0

In Study 1, 8 normotensive male subjects received a single oral dose of enalapril (5 mg) or nitrendipine (10 mg) in a crossover fashion. Exhaled air was collected at baseline and at 2, 4, and 8 hours after drug administration. In study 2, 10 normotensive subjects (6 males and 4 females) and 10 hypertensive subjects (6 males and 4 females) received a single oral dose of enalapril (5 mg). Exhaled air was collected at baseline and at 2 and 4 hours after drug administration. In Study 1, enalapril significantly increased the rate of lung NO release in normotensive patients (36.9 ± 5.1 pmol/sec at baseline versus 58.3 ± 7.3 pmol/sec at 4 hours, P<0.01). Nitrendipine did not change the NO release rate. In Study 2, enalapril significantly increased lung NO release in normotensive subjects (40.4+/-6.0 pmol/sec at baseline versus 70.3+/-11.4 pmol/sec at 4 hours, P<0.01), but not in hypertensive subjects. ACE inhibition increased NO production from the lung in normotensive subjects but not in hypertensive subjects. Decreased angiotensin II production and/or bradykinin accumulation in pulmonary tissue may be responsible for increased NO production in lung components such as pulmonary vascular endothelium, bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages, nasopharyngeal cells, and neurons. However, the effects of ACE inhibition on NO production from the lung differ between hypertensive subjects and normotensive subjects.",0,0

At baseline and after 6 months of randomized treatment with enalapril (10-20 mg) (nine patients, group 1) or enalapril (10-20 mg) and verapamil (120-240 mg) (nine patients, group 2), ventricular function remained at rest Balance during grip and cycling was assessed by radionuclide angiography. The mean MBF was measured at rest and after dipyridamole with positron emission tomography (PET) and 13N-ammonia as the flow tracer. At baseline, the two groups had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction at rest, which was further impaired during isometric exercise but increased during peak cycling exercise. MBF decreased similarly in the two groups at rest and during dipyridamole. No adverse events occurred during treatment in either group. After 6 months, there was no significant difference in main study variables before and after treatment, neither between the two groups nor within each group. Long-term combination therapy with verapamil and enalapril is safe in patients with DCM without overt heart failure. Although it had no positive effect on myocardial perfusion, the combined therapy prevented deterioration of left ventricular function, similar to enalapril alone.",0,0

524,11129125,Lercanidipine: a review of its use in hypertension.,,"McClellan, K J; Jarvis, B","Lercanidipine is a vasoselective dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that causes systemic vasodilation by blocking the influx of calcium ions through L-type calcium channels in cell membranes. It is a highly lipophilic drug and therefore has a slower onset and longer duration of action than a number of other calcium antagonists. Preclinical evidence suggests that lercanidipine has antiatherogenic potential and may also protect against end-organ damage. In well-controlled clinical studies, administration of 10 or 20 mg of lercanidipine once daily without affecting heart rate in patients with mild to moderate hypertension effectively lowered blood pressure (BP) compared to placebo. The response rate (percentage of patients with diastolic blood pressure < or =90 mm Hg or decreased > or =10 mm Hg from baseline) ranged from 50% to 66% with lercanidipine 10 mg/day and 86% with lercanidipine 20 mg/day. has come up. The drug had a long duration of action: clinical measurements for diastolic BP gave a trough/peak ratio of >0.8 for both doses of lercanidipine in 1 study.

In addition, lercanidipine was as effective as 20 mg/day and amlodipine 10 mg/day. Lercanidipine is effective in the treatment of elderly patients (aged 60 to 85 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension and patients with isolated systolic hypertension. In addition, lercanidipine monotherapy at 20 or 40 mg/day has shown efficacy in patients with severe hypertension, and add-on therapy has helped control BP in the majority of patients with severe hypertension who have not responded adequately to beta-blockers, diuretics, or ACE inhibitors. . Unpublished data suggest that the drug lowers blood pressure in patients with type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus without adversely affecting glucose homeostasis. Lercanidipine was well tolerated in clinical trials, with most treatment-related adverse events typical for dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, namely headache, flushing, dizziness and ankle edema; Lercanidipine is an effective and well tolerated once-daily antihypertensive agent in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In addition, the drug may lower blood pressure when used as monotherapy in patients with severe hypertension or as an adjunct in patients with resistant hypertension. Importantly, lercanidipine appears to be at least as effective and well tolerated as other commonly used antihypertensive agents. The drug therefore represents a useful therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with hypertension and will be particularly useful in patients who do not respond to or are intolerant to antihypertensive agents from other drug classes.",0,0

During NREM sleep, there was no significant association between changes in BP and treatment effects on sleep apnea activity. Blood pressure reduction after short-term antihypertensive treatment did not affect sleep-disordered breathing during NREM sleep.

528,11131271,"Comparison of the long-term therapeutic effect of temocapril, an ACE inhibitor, with a diuretic on microalbuminuria in non-diabetic essential hypertension.",,"Shionoiri, H; Kosaka, T; Kita, E; Takizawa, T; Takasaki, I","Many investigators have reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have antiproteinuric effects and delay the progression of renal failure in diabetic patients. On the other hand, these effects of ACE inhibitors have not been fully established in patients with essential hypertension. This study was conducted to prospectively evaluate whether temocapril, an ACE inhibitor, could alter the urinary microalbumin excretion rate (UAE) in hypertensive outpatients without signs of renal failure. To compare the long-term effect of temocapril with a diuretic on BAE, hypertensive patients treated with a diuretic (trichlormethiazide) were enrolled in a prospective study if they had normal serum creatinine levels and no overt proteinuria during a 3-month screening period. . A urinary microalbumin-urine-creatinine ratio (mg albumin/mmol Cr) was used to estimate the UAE. Patients visited the hospital monthly to determine blood pressure (BP) and BAE. After baseline observation during treatment with diuretics, subjects were randomly divided into two groups. In group A, the diuretic was switched to temocapril 2 to 4 mg once daily for 12 months. In group B, subjects continued to take diuretics for an additional 12 months. Seventy-six outpatients (41 males and 35 females; mean age, 59.0+/-1.4 years) with essential hypertension participated in the study. The effects of temocapril on BP appeared clinically similar to those of trichlormethiazide, but use of temocapril significantly reduced BAE. In Group A (n=37), BAE 2.47+/-0.29 and 2.68+/-0.28 mg from the baseline value of 4.19+/-0.37 mg albumin/mmol Cr albumin/mmol Cr decreased significantly (p<0.01) at 6 and 12 months of temocapril treatment, respectively. In contrast, BAE was unchanged in group B (n=39) (baseline, 4.16+/-0.63 mg albumin/mmol Cr; 6 months, 4.92+/-0.72; 12 months, 4, 71+/-0.74). These results suggest that long-term treatment with temocapril may be superior to diuretic therapy in reducing BAE in patients with essential hypertension without signs of renal failure.",0,0
529,11131272,Blood pressure control in Japanese hypertensives with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus.,,"Katayama, S; Inaba, M; Morita, T; Awata, T; Shimamoto, K; Kikkawa, R","Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension are considered to be at high risk for cardiovascular diseases. Recent guidelines for the treatment of hypertension, such as the JNC VI and WHO/ISH guidelines, recommend classifying antihypertensive agents as low as 130/85 mmHg and lowering blood pressure below 130/85 mmHg. Our study was designed to explain how well and to what extent blood pressure (BP) is controlled in Japanese hypertensive patients with or without type 2 diabetes. We interviewed two hundred doctors randomly selected from members of the Japanese Hypertension Society (JSH) (n=98) and the Japanese Diabetes Association (JDS) (n=102) and received information about the latest five cases of hypertension. (n=954 in total) and the 2 most recent cases of hypertension without diabetes (n=371 in total). The resulting BP was below 140/90 mmHg in 40.5% of non-diabetic and 38.3% of diabetic hypertensives. The proportion of patients with blood pressure below 130/85 mmHg was 10.8% in non-diabetics and 11.4% in diabetics. The mean number of hypotensive agents used was 1.46 in non-diabetics and 1.52 in diabetics. Physicians prescribed more ACE inhibitors and alpha-blockers to diabetics than nondiabetics, but Ca-antagonists were administered in more than 70% of patients with or without diabetes. In contrast, fewer beta-blockers and diuretics were administered to diabetics. These results show that although Japanese physicians consider the effects of hypotensive agents on metabolism and kidney function when treating diabetic hypertensives, the blood pressure achieved in both diabetic and nondiabetic hypertensives is insufficient, with only one in ten patients having blood pressure. less than 130/85 mmHg, even among diabetics. Therefore, improved blood pressure control will be needed to treat high-risk groups such as patients with diabetes mellitus.",0,0

After a 4-week drug-free period, 17 patients were randomly divided into two groups. The first group (group 1: n=8) received lisinopril 10-20 mg daily for 8 weeks followed by 5-10 mg daily nitrendipine for 8 weeks. The second group (group 2: n=9) received nitrendipine 5-10 mg daily for 8 weeks followed by lisinopril 10-20 mg daily for 8 weeks. Mean blood pressure (MBP) was similarly significantly reduced in both groups. The UAE was significantly reduced after 8 weeks of treatment with lisinopril in group 1 and after 8 weeks of subsequent treatment with lisinopril in group 2. On the other hand, BAE did not change with treatment with nitrendipine. Changes in BAE were significantly associated with changes in MBP after 8 weeks of treatment with nitrendipine, but not after 8 weeks of treatment with lisinopril. No significant changes in creatinine clearance, urinary sodium excretion, or urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide were observed with any treatment in either group. These results suggest that lisinopril, not nitrendipine, reduces BAE in essential hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria, independent of its potent antihypertensive properties.",0,0

There is convincing data that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and adrenergic blockade are the most important treatments and have the capacity to improve survival and reduce morbidity. Higher doses of both ACE inhibitors and beta blockers appear to provide additional benefits. When used in severe heart failure, the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone provides an additional survival advantage when added to standard triple therapy. Angiotensin receptor blockers have not been shown to be superior to ACE inhibitors and their role in heart failure treatment requires further investigation. No study data support the use of inotropic agents or calcium channel blockers in heart failure. A number of new therapeutic agents, including vasopressin antagonists and tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor antibody, are in phase II and III clinical trials. If proven useful, they could provide new treatment options for patients with heart failure. However, the current challenge is to increase the use of proven therapies such as ACE inhibitors and beta blockers to improve outcomes in the rapidly growing patient population with congestive heart failure.",0,0

He presented with jaundice after 3 years of continuous therapy and progressive hepatic failure that persisted despite discontinuation of the drug. The patient was not taking any other medication. All known causes of acute liver failure can be excluded by pointing to drug-induced liver injury after prolonged treatment with enalapril. Analysis of liver biopsies revealed a pathomorphological pattern comparable to that observed in severe halothane hepatitis. Serological studies including T-cell stimulation with enalapril and a broad spectrum of autoimmunity tests, including autoantibodies to calreticulin, the major Ca2+ and Zn2+ binding protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, and which have been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of halothane hepatitis, were negative. Therefore, the mechanism of enalapril-induced liver injury remains unclear. Liver failure progressed and eventually led to orthotopic liver transplantation. To our knowledge, this is the longest duration of chronic treatment with an ACE inhibitor before hepatic failure occurs. In addition, hepatic failure progressed despite discontinuation of the drug. It was concluded that hepatic failure could be induced even after prolonged treatment with an ACE inhibitor. Therefore, regular monitoring of liver enzymes should be considered.",0,0

Hypersensitivity or immune-mediated reactions, although less common, tend to be proportionately more serious. There is convincing evidence that the immune system plays a role in the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity reactions. Our understanding of the way the immune system recognizes drugs is based on the hapten hypothesis; The onset of hypersensitivity includes drug bioactivation, covalent binding to proteins, followed by uptake, antigen processing, and T cell proliferation. Central to this hypothesis is the critical role of drug metabolism, with the balance between metabolic bioactivation and detoxification, an important component of individual responsiveness. The purpose of this review is to classify drug hypersensitivity reactions in terms of their clinical presentation and also to consider recent advances in our understanding of the chemical, biochemical, and particularly cellular immunological mechanisms of hypersensitivity. The following topics are reviewed: (i) drug regulation and cellular metabolism; (ii) antigen processing and presentation mechanisms; (iii) the role of cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules in initiating and maintaining a polarized immune response; and (iv) application of the hapten hypothesis, hazard hypothesis, and serial trigger model to drug hypersensitivity. A better understanding of the mechanism(s) of hypersensitivity can identify new therapeutic strategies and help combat one of the more severe forms of adverse reactions to drugs.",0,0

Neurohormonal effects may be important in this regard as well as the premature haemodynamic discharge induced by these drugs. The primary aim was to evaluate the effect of trandolapril on plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide. A secondary aim was to evaluate the effects of trandolapril on selected neurohormones, vasoactive peptides and enzymes that may be important in the development of left ventricular remodeling and heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. A total of 119 patients with acute myocardial infarction and a wall motion index < or = 1.2 (16-segment echocardiographic model) were randomized to double-blind treatment with trandolapril or placebo within 3-7 days of infarction onset. Blind treatment was discontinued 21 days after index infarction. Venous blood samples were collected at rest, before randomization, and the day after treatment was discontinued. At study end, there was no difference in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide between the two treatment groups. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity was suppressed and plasma renin activity was higher in the trandolapril group. There was no difference between the two treatment groups in the plasma levels of N-terminal proatrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, noradrenaline, adrenaline, vasopressin, large endothelin-1 and neuropeptide Y. There were positive correlations at baseline between several markers of neurohormonal activation and variables expressing left ventricular dysfunction and clinical heart failure. Neurohormonal activation is associated with left ventricular dysfunction. The effects of 2-3 weeks of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on neurohormonal activation do not predict beneficial long-term effects already established after myocardial infarction. Therefore, early modulation of circulating neurohormone levels may not be the main mechanism for the efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in these patients. Selected plasma hormone markers can still be used to identify patients who may benefit most from treatment.",0,0

We hypothesized that both ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (AT(1)-A) increase the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) by reducing oxidative stress in the vessel wall, possibly by increasing EC-SOD activity. Thirty-five patients with CAD were randomized to either ACEI (ramipril 10 mg/day) or AT(1)-A (losartan 100 mg/day) for 4 weeks. FDD of the radial artery was determined by high resolution ultrasound before and after intraarterial N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) to inhibit NO synthase and before and after intraarterial vitamin C to determine the inhibited portion of FDD. by oxygen free radicals. EC-SOD activity was determined after it was released from the endothelium by bolus injection of heparin. FDD was improved after ramipril and losartan (each group P<0.01) and specifically, the NO-mediated portion of FDD, ie inhibited by L-NMMA, increased by >75% (each group P<0.01). Vitamin C initially improved FDD, an effect that disappeared after ramipril or losartan.

CONCLUSIONS-Four weeks of treatment with ramipril or losartan improves endothelial function at similar rates in patients with CAD by increasing the bioavailability of NO. Our results suggest that the beneficial long-term effects of interaction with the renin-angiotensin system may be related to the reduction of oxidative stress in the arterial wall, mediated in part by increased EC-SOD activity.",0,0

548,11174914,Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes: lessons from recent trials.,,"Agarwal, R","Hypertension plays a critical role in causing a high rate of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus. Large trials show that lowering blood pressure in the diabetic patient with hypertension has extremely positive effects. This review discusses recent studies to answer the question of how much patients' blood pressure should drop and which agents should be used to achieve this goal. National Institutes of Health guidelines published in the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure call for a blood pressure target of <130/85 mmHg in patients with diabetes. Based on data from recent studies, an even lower blood pressure of <130/80 mmHg seems appropriate in patients with diabetes and hypertension. Observational studies show that the lowest rate of cardiovascular events is observed in diabetic patients with systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg. Therefore, diabetic patients with hypertension may need to revise the target blood pressure to a lower, <120/80 mmHg. In patients with overt proteinuria of 1 g/day or more, a mean arterial pressure of <92 mmHg is recommended. Current evidence justifies the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as first-line agents and angiotensin receptor blockers in patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors. Since the blood pressure target is lower in hypertensive diabetic patients, more than one agent should be used in these patients. Diuretics or long-acting calcium channel blockers are logical second choices because of the synergistic blood pressure lowering effects observed with ACE inhibitors.

Evaluation of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival.,,"Massie, B M; Armstrong, P W; Cleland, J G; Horowitz, J D; Packer, M; Poole-Wilson, P A; RydÃ©n, L","Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), but most affected patients do not receive these agents or are treated at lower doses than those found to be effective in trials. due to concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents, particularly at recommended doses. This study examines its high-safety and tolerability compared to low-dose lisinopril in CHF. The Lisinopril and Survival Evaluation study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study in which patients with or without prior ACE inhibitor therapy were stabilized by taking a moderate dose of lisinopril (12.5 or 15.0 mg [OD]) for 2 to 4 weeks. and then randomized to high (35.0 or 32.5 mg OD) or low dose (5.0 or 2.5 mg OD) groups. Patients with New York Heart Association class II to IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions no greater than 0.30 (n=3164) were randomized and followed for a median of 46 months. We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for drug discontinuation and dose reduction during therapy, focusing on hypotension and renal dysfunction; Of the 405 patients who had not previously received an ACE inhibitor, only 4.2% of the doses could not be titrated to the intermediate doses required for randomization, possibly due to symptoms associated with hypotension (2.0%) or renal dysfunction or hyperkalaemia (2.3%). Doses in more than 90% of randomized patients in the high- and low-dose groups were titrated to assigned targets, and mean doses of blanked drugs in both groups remained similar throughout the study. Withdrawal occurred in 27.1% of the high-dose groups and 30.7% of the low-dose groups. Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance (blood pressure, <120 mm Hg; creatinine, > or =132.6 micromol/L [> or =1.5 mg/dL]; age, > or =70 years; and diabetes ) generally tolerated the high-dose strategy; These findings suggest that ACE inhibitor therapy can be successfully titrated and maintained at high doses in the majority of patients with CHF, warranting more aggressive use of these agents.",0,0

[14C]telmisartan was administered orally in solution as a single 40 mg dose to 5 subjects. 5 subjects received a shorter intravenous infusion of [14C]telmisartan 40 mg. Measurement of total 14C radioactivity in plasma showed that approximately 50% was absorbed following oral administration and the maximum plasma concentration was observed after 0.5 to 1 hour. The absolute bioavailability was 43%. On average, 84% of the total radioactivity in plasma reflected the parent compound. The remainder of the total radioactivity can be attributed to the glucuronide conjugate of telmisartan, which represents the only human metabolite. About 99.5% of telmisartan was bound to plasma protein, mainly albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Telmisartan was distributed reversibly into erythrocytes. More than 90% of the administered dose was excreted within 120 hours, and elimination equilibrium was complete 144 hours after dosing. Radioactivity was almost completely (>98%) excreted in faeces; urinary excretion accounts for < 1% of the dose, regardless of the route of administration. The glucuronide conjugate of telmisartan was predominant in the small fraction excreted in the urine. Although some telmisartan glucuronide was detected in plasma, only unchanged drug was detected in stool. No changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram, or clinical laboratory tests were detected after administration of telmisartan, and adverse events, predominantly non-treatment-related and mild, were rare.

Bioequivalence (ie lack of interaction) was concluded if the 90% CI of the ratios for both Cmax and AUC were within the acceptance limit of 0.80 to 1.25. Geometric mean Cmax values for acetaminophen and the R-(-)- and S-(+)-ibuprofen enantiomers were similar (12.6 micrograms/mL versus 14.1 micrograms/mL; 17.3 micrograms/mL') with and without telmisartan.

HCTZ (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25 mg) for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was measured at baseline and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks; Telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg reduced supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) - the primary efficacy parameter - by 13.3 mmHg and supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 21.5 mmHg. These reductions represented benefits of 13.7/8.7 mmHg over 80 mg telmisartan and 12.3/8.1 mmHg over 12.5 mg HCTZ (p < 0.01). Telmisartan 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg decreased supine groove SBP/DBP by 14.3/10.0 mmHg, which is 12.3/3.3 mmHg more than telmisartan 40 mg and 5.1/4 more than HCTZ 12.5 mg. 8 mmHg more. This reached significance for comparisons with 40 mg telmisartan for SBP and 12.5 mg HCTZ for DBP (p<0.05). A response surface analysis and therapeutic response rates confirmed the additive antihypertensive effects of telmisartan and HCTZ. All treatments were well tolerated with side-effect profiles comparable to placebo. Adverse events were mostly transient and of mild to moderate severity; Telmisartan 80 mg combined with HCTZ 12.5 mg is effective and well tolerated in black patients with mild to moderate hypertension and provides greater antihypertensive activity than related monotherapies.",0,0

Although diltiazem is characterized as a heart rate-lowering calcium antagonist, there are no studies measuring the magnitude of HR changes in patients with angina or hypertension; The study was conducted to investigate the magnitude of proportional HR reduction at varying resting CH levels with the sustained-release formulation of diltiazem (SR diltiazem) at the usual clinical doses of 200 or 300 mg once daily. This meta-analysis was conducted in six comparative double-blind studies involving 771 patients with angina or hypertension in which SR diltiazem 200-300 mg once daily was compared with placebo or other agents known to not affect HR (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). , diuretics). Sustained-release diltiazem reduces high initial CH with an increasing effect at higher initial rates; Multiple comparisons by baseline HR category showed a significant difference between both groups for baseline HR 74-84 bpm and > or = 85 bpm (p = 0.001). Sustained-release diltiazem had no significant HR-reducing effect on baseline HR < or =74 bpm, but appears to have a real modulating effect on HR: it reduces tachycardia without causing excessive bradycardia. These findings contradict dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, which tend to increase HR and are associated with an adverse outcome in acute cardiovascular conditions. There is also evidence to suggest that HR-lowering calcium channel blockers reduce cardiovascular event rates following myocardial infarction; When the use of calcium antagonists in patients with angina or hypertension is indicated, a CH lowering agent, i.e. diltiazem, should be recommended instead of dihydropyridine.",0,0

568,11197588,New competition in the field of renin-angiotensin axis inhibition; Angiotensin II receptor antagonists in congestive heart failure.,,"Martineau, P; Goulet, J","To critically review studies comparing angiotensin II (AgII) receptor antagonists with placebo or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF); A MEDLINE search (1988 - January 2000) was used to identify relevant literature. Additional references were also obtained from selected articles; Since most published CHF studies have been done with candesartan and losartan, these agents are the main focus of this article. However, all comparative clinical studies identified were reviewed and included, regardless of the agent used; AgII receptor antagonists inhibit the effects of AgII at the subtype 1 receptor, independent of the AgII synthesis pathway. They offer a hemodynamic profile similar to ACE inhibitors without reflex neurohormonal activation. They have been shown to be at least as effective as ACE inhibitors in improving symptoms, exercise capacity, and New York Heart Association functional class in patients with CHF. Although the ELITE (Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly) study suggested that losartan improves survival compared to captopril, this study was not designed to look at mortality. A sufficiently robust study, ELITE-II showed no difference in mortality rates between patients receiving captopril and patients receiving losartan. The combination of AgII receptor antagonists and ACE inhibitors provides additional benefit in lowering blood pressure and preventing ventricular remodeling. AgII receptor antagonists are well tolerated with a similar or lower incidence of side effects to that of ACE inhibitors. The lack of effects on bradykinin degradation may explain the lower incidence of cough; Data collected so far in patients with CHF highlight that ACE inhibitors should remain the treatment of choice and AgII receptor antagonists may be considered an acceptable alternative for patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors.",0,0
569,11201013,The role of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertensive elderly patients.,,"Gosch, M","The prevalence of hypertension is high in elderly patients. Randomized studies have already shown that it is highly effective in treating healthy elderly people with hypertension. Still, some questions arose. On the one hand, the generalizability of these research results is unclear, especially for elderly people with severe medical comorbidities and poor functional status. On the other hand, different antihypertensive drugs have been shown to be effective. Which medicine for which patient? Even data from randomized intervention studies showing that treatment affects cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were lacking, ACE inhibitors have been used for more than a decade to treat high blood pressure. For a younger population, the captopril prevention project showed no difference in primary endpoints (myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular death) between ACE inhibitors and conventional antihypertensive therapy (diuretics, beta-blocker). The STOP-2 trial also confirmed these results for elderly patients. When treating elderly patients, one should be aware of the physiological changes and comorbidities with age. Important for this group of patients is the decrease in kidney function. Admissions for uremia due to the use of ACE inhibitors are still commonplace, but many cases can be prevented by monitoring renal function, but guidelines are still lacking. With regard to comorbidities, ACE inhibitors have benefits compared to other antihypertensive drugs, particularly in conditions of heart failure, diabetes and coronary heart disease.",0,0

In this situation, it was unknown whether vascular insulin resistance could be ameliorated by antihypertensive therapy. Therefore, we determined the effect of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on vascular sensitivity to insulin in hypertensive subjects fed a sodium-restricted diet; The effects of 3 months treatment with Quinapril on vascular sensitivity to insulin were evaluated in 11 hypertensive subjects using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design. Vascular susceptibility to insulin was assessed by determining the insulin ED50 from the dorsal hand vessel linear variable differential transformer in vessels pre-narrowed with phenylephrine. Subjects were maintained on a sodium diet of 75 mmol/day for 3 days prior to each study; Quinapril treatment significantly improved vascular sensitivity to insulin, as assessed by a reduction in ED50 for insulin (ED50 insulin: placebo = 501 +/- 189 [muU/min; quinapril = 276 +/-100 muU/min P < 0.05) .

Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were measured with a fixed infusion technique. The reference substances used are [131I]iodohippurate (Hippuran) and [125I]iothalamate. The lithium clearance method was used to measure renal water and sodium processing. Microalbuminuria was measured. Subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken and the ratio of medium thickness to lumen diameter of small resistant vessels was determined. Left ventricular mass index was determined by echocardiography. Thirty-seven patients with newly diagnosed or poorly controlled essential hypertension were randomized to treatment with isradipine, perindopril, or hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride-based regimens. Atenolol and hydralazine were added as secondary and tertiary drugs, respectively, when necessary, to normalize diastolic blood pressure. Investigations were carried out 9 months before and after the normalization of blood pressure. Renal function in untreated hypertensive patients is characterized by increased renal vascular resistance, decreased renal blood flow, normal glomerular filtration fraction, and normal serum creatinine. No correlation was found between peripheral resistance vascular structure in subcutaneous vessels and renal hemodynamic parameters. Patients with severe left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass >360 g) had a lower glomerular filtration fraction, higher renal vascular resistance, lower renal blood flow, and increased microalbuminuria compared with patients with less significant cardiac changes. After 1 year of treatment with a profound effect on cardiovascular structure, patients receiving the ACE inhibitor perindopril or the Ca-antagonist isradipine-based antihypertensive treatment regimens had no change in renal haemodynamics, whereas renal plasma flow was reduced, the glomerular filtration rate was preserved in those treated with a diuretic-based regimen, and The filtration fraction increased significantly.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of home-measured BP for monitoring and controlling patients with arterial hypertension during a homogeneous treatment. An additional objective was to determine the degree of office BP control achieved. This was a prospective, longitudinal, observational, and multicenter study in a cohort of 156 patients of both sexes over 18 years of age with essential hypertension. All had previously received the fixed combination enalapril/HCTZ 20/6 mg as the sole hypertensive agent for at least 4 weeks. Office BP was the average of three measurements. A semi-automatic device (OMRON HEM 705 CP) was used for BP at home. The patients measured their blood pressure twice a day for 2 consecutive days. The mean differences between the two measurement methods were low but significant: 3.99 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP; p < 0.05), and 2.02 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP; p < 0.05). Pearson's regression coefficient between office and home values was highly significant for SBP, DBP, and heart rate (p < 0.0001). Home BP measurement was highly reproducible compared to day two, as indicated by the high intra-class correlation coefficient for individual measurements on day one: 0.88 for SBP (95% confidence interval, CI 0.82–0.92; p < 0.00001) and 0.89 (95% CI 0) for DBP. .83-0.93; p < 0.00001). The percentage of patients with tight office DBP and SBP control (< 140/90 mmHg) was 61.3% and the percentage of patients with DBP control (< 90 mmHg) was 92%.

577,11217909,ACE gene polymorphism and cough threshold for capsaicin after use of cilazapril.,,"Takahashi, T; Yamaguchi, E; Furuya, K; Kawakami, Y","Persistent dry cough is an occasional but clinically important adverse reaction to angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs). Its reported incidence is variable and it is unclear why cough occurs only in certain individuals. An insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with serum ACE activity. We have previously shown that susceptibility to ACEI-induced cough is associated with this polymorphism, such that genotype II patients are more susceptible to cough than patients with other genotypes. To confirm and extend our previous observation, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study in 10 genotype II and 10 healthy volunteers with genotype DD. The cough threshold was determined by the concentration of inhaled capsaicin that caused two or more coughs. After use of an ACEI, cilazapril, over 4 weeks, changes in cough threshold in subjects with genotype II [before: 6.6+/-3.7 nM (mean+/-SD); after: 5.0+/-4.6 nM] was significantly different from that in subjects with genotype DD (before: 9.0+/-9.4 nM; after: 9.3+/-9.1 nM).

In contrast, cutaneous responses to intradermal substance P were not altered in subjects with either genotype. These findings provide further evidence for a link between ACEI-induced cough and the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene, suggesting that ACEIs induce cough by modulating the tissue level of bradykinin.",0,0

Based on these observations, the first-line use of beta-blockers in obese hypertensive patients should be reviewed. Obesity management in overweight hypertensive patients may be more difficult in the face of beta-blocker therapy.",0,0

Patients scheduled for CABG (n = 149) were randomized 4 weeks before surgery. Study drug was used up to 1 year after CABG at randomization. Exercise test was performed at randomization; One year after CABG, the exercise test was repeated and the patients underwent 48 hours of Holter monitoring. Clinical ischemic events were recorded and defined as death, revascularization, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris recurrence, ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Overall exercise time increased by 75 +/- 76 seconds overall 1 year after CABG (placebo +79 +/- 75 seconds, quinapril +72 +/- 79 seconds, p = 0.6). All patients had ischemic ST-segment changes at the time of randomization; 33% of patients had ischemic ST segment changes 1 year after CABG (placebo 29%, quinapril 37%, p = 0.4). On Holter monitoring, the number of patients experiencing > or = 1 ischemia episode was equal in both groups. Treatment with quinapril significantly reduced clinical ischemic events after CABG: 15% in patients receiving placebo versus 4% in patients receiving quinapril (hazard ratio 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.87, p = 0.02).

Protocol 1 was ANP (30 ng/kg/min) infused before and after ACEi (n = 9) treatment. Protocol 2 was acute saline loading with or without co-administration of ANP (n = 8). In both protocols, cardiorenal hemodynamics and urinary sodium excretion were evaluated before and after each intervention; Protocol 1: Although ANP infusion significantly increased urinary sodium excretion before and after ACEi therapy to a similar extent, infusion increased glomerular filtration rate (75 +/- 16 --> 82 +/-15 mL/min, P <.05 ) and renal blood flow (390 +/- 123 --> 438 +/- 140 mL/min, P <.05) only before ACEi therapy. Protocol 2: Acute saline solution loading decreased plasma renin activity (P < .05), but did not affect ANP level.

586,11232737,Management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the elderly: special considerations.,,"Rosenstock, J","The principles of treatment for type 2 diabetes in the elderly are not different from those in younger patients, but priorities and treatment strategies must be carefully individualized. The goals of treatment are to improve glycemic control with a stepwise approach that includes non-pharmacological modalities, including diet and exercise, and pharmacological treatment, which includes mixtures of oral antihyperglycemic agents, alone or in combination with insulin. While the treatment goals for older and younger patients are the same, some aspects of type 2 diabetes in the elderly require special attention. Treatment decisions are influenced by age and life expectancy, comorbid conditions, and severity of vascular complications. Adherence to dietary therapy, physical activity, and medication regimens may be compromised by comorbid conditions and psychosocial limitations. Drug-induced hypoglycemia was the main consideration and the most serious potential complication. In addition, long-term macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes are an important source of morbidity and mortality. Indeed, a significant number of patients already have vascular and neuropathic complications at the time of diagnosis, and the effect of improved diabetes control depends on the patient's age and life expectancy. Age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and potential side effects and drug interactions should also be considered when selecting appropriate pharmacological therapy. In general, a conservative and gradual approach to the management of the elderly patient with type 2 diabetes is recommended; Treatment may be initiated as monotherapy followed by early intervention with a combination of oral agents containing a sulfonylurea as the main insulin secretagogue in addition to a complementary insulin sensitizer. If significant hyperglycemia [glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >8%] persists despite oral combination therapy, eventually insulin therapy is required. Combination therapy with evening insulin and a long-acting sulfonylurea such as glimepiride is an effective strategy to improve hyperglycemia in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes who have failed multidrug therapy with oral agents. In addition, such a regimen is easy to follow for the patient who cannot adapt to a more complex insulin regimen. Hyperglycemia in the elderly can be well managed with practical intervention and a simple treatment plan to improve compliance. If treatment is individualized, optimal glycemic control should be possible for each patient; however, tight glycemic control may not be achieved in all patients or even desirable in many elderly patients.",0,0

Insulin resistance is characterized by impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake. The involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of hyperinsulinemia in EH patients has not been unanimously proven. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of antihypertensive treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI, enalapril = 10 mg/day) (9 male patients) or angiotensin II AT-1 receptor blocker (A II RB = losartan 50 mg/day).

The 3-hour euglycemic clamp test with continuous insulin infusion (50 mU/m2/min) was performed twice: before and after 8 weeks of treatment with ACEI or A II RB, respectively. The control group (KG) consisted of 12 healthy men (clamp test was performed once). Serum insulin concentration (I) was estimated by radioimmunoassay. Glucose excretion rate (M value = mg/kg/min) and tissue insulin sensitivity (M/I value = mg/kg/min per mU/l) were calculated in CG subjects and patients with EH before and after antihypertensive. treatment with ACEI or A II RB, respectively.

In contrast to ACEI, treatment with A II RB did not affect either the M (5.75 +/- 0.21) nor the M/I (4.79 +/- 0.21) values, respectively. Unlike A II RB, ACEI exerts a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity in EH patients. This effect does not appear to be mediated by an effect on the AT-1 receptor.",0,0

Customizing drug therapy offers the potential for optimal safety and efficacy in an individual patient. Such a process conflicts with existing prescribing practices that use drugs that have been shown to be safe and effective in patient populations or based on anecdotal experience. Within patient populations, drugs differ in their effectiveness among individual patients. More importantly, a drug that is safe and effective in one patient may be ineffective or even harmful in another. Underlying many of these phenotypic differences are genotypic variants (polymorphisms) of key enzymes and proteins that affect the safety and efficacy of a drug in a given patient. Understanding these polymorphisms has the potential to improve patient care by allowing physicians to customize drug selection to meet individual patient needs. Pharmacogenomics can also reduce morbidity and mortality, leading to improved compliance and a shorter time to optimal disease management. Significant cost savings can result from reductions in polypharmacy, as well as fewer doctor visits and hospitalizations for exacerbation of the underlying disease and adverse drug reactions.",0,0

The observation that vasodilators can improve both cardiac function and mortality led to the investigation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs). Although these agents have significant vasodilatory properties, their primary benefit appears to be related to their ability to influence inadequate left ventricular remodeling. Recent randomized clinical trials show that Beta Adrenergic Blocking agents can provide an increased effect on both mortality and morbidity when added to treatment with ACEIs. Although these agents improved the heart failure patient's outlook, they had little effect on improving left ventricular function.

Echocardiography was performed on all patients at admission and on days 10, 90, and 180 to determine end-systolic volume (ESV), ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic diameter, E/A ratio, and E deceleration time. as well as isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) and peak velocities of E and A; The patency of the infarct-related artery was not seen in non-reperfused patients, while this vessel was patent in reperfused patients (7-10 days after AMI). The two groups were similar in age, gender, incidence of diabetes, smoking habits, hypertension, creatine kinase enzymatic peak, adjuvant therapy, baseline EF, ESV, and incidence of coronary artery bypass grafting/coronary angioplasty. After 10 days of treatment (canrenoate group), only 9 patients presented with serum K and creatinine concentrations > 5.5 mmol/l and > 2.0 mg/dl, respectively. Among patients receiving canrenoate, the mitral E/A ratio was higher than in the placebo group (p = 0.001), whereas the ESV was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The slowing time in reperfused patients receiving canrenoate was greater than that observed in reperfused patients in the placebo group. Within-group EF increased significantly (p = 0.042). Compared with the placebo group, IVRT was significantly higher in non-reperfused patients receiving canrenoate than in the placebo group (p = 0.001). Serum creatinine, blood urea and K levels, and incidence and prevalence of vascular disease were similar for both groups. No adverse effects were observed during the study period.; Our data suggest that the combination of captopril plus canrenoate is suitable for the initial treatment of patients presenting with AMI. It is also more effective in improving E/A ratio, ESV, EF and IVRT compared to captopril alone.",0,0

604,11258145,Renal effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors resulting in cost savings and improved patient outcomes.,,"Swislocki, A L; Siegel, D","In some patients with kidney disease, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is thought to improve kidney function, while in others their use causes worsening. Many questions remain about the categories of patients who benefit from the use of ACE inhibitors; To clarify the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with kidney disease; A literature review was conducted focusing on various kidney diseases, ACE inhibitors, and cost-effectiveness criteria. Nearly 100 clinical studies were reviewed. Treatment with ACE inhibitors appears to have beneficial effects in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus with nephropathy, AIDS nephropathy, and other non-diabetic kidney diseases. The use of these agents in these diseases provides potential cost savings and improved quality of life by reducing the progression of kidney disease and the need for dialysis. Data supporting target blood pressure point to the need to aggressively reduce this risk factor. The use of ACE inhibitors is dangerous, especially in bilateral renal artery stenosis with volume depletion, but may be valuable in patients with unilateral stenosis. ACE inhibitor therapy is likely to be beneficial in African-Americans, but the doses required may be higher than in whites and caution should be exercised in some cases. The potential efficacy of angiotensin receptor blockers and other new drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system is evaluated. The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial in kidney disease states characterized by increased glomerular perfusion pressure, their use in other kidney disease states, particularly those characterized by low glomerular perfusion pressure, may be risky. The benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy are so striking in terms of cost savings and improved quality of life that their use in certain clinical situations should be strongly encouraged in managed care and other practice settings.",0,0

Uncontrolled studies show that multisite biventricular pacing improves hemodynamics and well-being by reducing ventricular asynchrony. We evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of this new treatment; 67 patients with severe heart failure due to chronic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (New York Heart Association class III), normal sinus rhythm, and QRS interval greater than 150 milliseconds received transvenous atriobiventricular pacemakers (leads in one lead). atrium and each ventricle). This single-blind, randomized, controlled crossover study compared patients' responses over two periods: three months of inactive pacing period (inhibited ventricular pacing at 40 bpm at baseline rate) and three months of active (atriobiventricular pacing period) acceleration. The primary endpoint was the six-minute walk; secondary endpoints were questionnaire-measured quality of life, peak oxygen consumption, heart failure-related hospitalizations, patients' treatment preference (active and inactive pacing), and mortality; Nine patients withdrew from the study prior to randomization, and 10 failed to complete both study periods.

In addition, eyeball EF was estimated in 2D echo and cineangiography and compared with conventional methods. The agreement between the results was evaluated by the Bland and Altman method.; The agreement between 2-D echo and cineangiography results was poor.

Dose-related adverse drug events (ACEs) often cause compliance problems, and many ACEs occur at starting doses of antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, it is an established principle to initiate antihypertensive therapy at low doses to avoid ACEs that impair patients' quality of life and reduce compliance. However, what are the lowest effective doses of antihypertensive drugs?; To compare the starting doses recommended in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) with those recommended in the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC VI); A review of the most recent JNC VI report (1997) and the 1999 and 2000 editions of the PDR and medical literature; JNC VI recommends significantly lower starting doses for 23 (58%) of the 40 drugs compared to PDR. In addition, for 37 (82%) of the 45 drugs, PDR guidelines do not recommend lower starting doses for elderly or frail patients than for younger adults. Although the PDR is the most commonly used drug reference by physicians, it does not reflect the lowest starting doses recommended by the JNC VI for most of the most prescribed antihypertensive drugs. Because avoidance of ACEs is necessary to maintain compliance with antihypertensive therapy, and because many antihypertensive ACEs are dose-related, physicians should know the lowest effective, least ACE-prone doses.

Although ACE inhibitors improve LV function, their beneficial role in exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias has not been established. To examine the effects of ACE inhibitors on exercise capacity compared to their role in exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, 25 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) of various etiologies in NYHA Class II and III underwent a prospective randomized controlled trial. . Conventional therapy (digital and diuretics) was administered to the control group of 12 patients, and enalapril/captopril was additionally given to the test group as tolerated. They were followed for 3 months. Exercise testing on the treadmill and monitoring of clinical and biochemical parameters were performed at the beginning and end of the study in all cases. Ventricular arrhythmias observed during exercise and for 10 minutes post-exercise were analyzed using Lown's rating for frequency and severity of ventricular arrhythmia. Mean exercise duration showed a significant improvement over the ACE inhibitor compared to the control group (p < 0.05), but there was no significant change in arrhythmia grades. Serum electrolytes and other biochemical parameters were within the normal range. It was concluded that the effect of ACE inhibitor on improving functional capacity in CHF was independent of any effect on exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias.",0,0

The size of the infarct was determined using the creatine kinase integral method. Fifty patients were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging at 1 and 26 weeks after infarction. The following parameters were determined: infarct weight and diastolic diameter of the infarcted area, systolic wall tension, muscle mass, diastolic and systolic diameters, systolic wall thickening and motility of the non-infarcted myocardium; Infarct weight increased 5.7% (p < 0.05) under captopril and 6.1% (p < 0.05) under fosinopril. The diastolic diameter of the infarcted area decreased by 12% (p < 0.001) under captopril and by 11% (p < 0.001) under fosinopril. Systolic wall thickness increased by 12.1% (p < 0.001) and muscle mass by 12.7% (p < 0.001) under captopril and 15.4% (p < 0.001) and 9.6% (p < 0.01) under fosinopril, respectively.

Few clinical studies distinguish the effects of CCB as monotherapy. We performed a comprehensive comparison of two CCBs in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. Thirty patients with pre-treatment diastolic blood pressure > or = 100 mm Hg were randomly assigned to either nifedipine-GITS or verapamil-SR. Dose titration yielded a diastolic blood pressure reduction of < or = 95 mm Hg or > or = 15 mm Hg over 4 weeks.

Plasma renin activity, atrial natriuretic peptide, norepinephrine and epinephrine were tested. Both drugs induced similar reductions in clinical and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and left ventricular mass index. Compared to nifedipine-GITS, verapamil-SR produced significantly lower resting and peak exercise heart rate. Nifedipine-GITS elicited a lower peak exercise systolic BP. At the end of the titration, nifedipine-GITS produced lower plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels that were no longer evident at 6 months. Plasma norepinephrine was lower with verapamil-SR at final titration and at 3 months, but not at 6 months. Plasma epinephrine and plasma renin activity were not altered by either drug. There was no difference in systolic or diastolic left ventricular function or coronary flow reserve between the two treatments. Once-daily nifedipine-GITS and verapamil-SR are equally effective in reducing arterial pressure in moderate to severe hypertension.

We conducted a cross-sectional study in 120 patients with stable CHF (median ejection fraction 30%). We also hypothesized that ACE inhibitors and beta blockers would beneficially affect the measured indices; In cross-sectional analysis, plasma viscosity (P=0.001), fibrinogen (P=0.02), vWF (P<0.0001) and soluble P-selectin (P<0.001) levels were increased in patients with CHF compared to healthy controls. . Women showed more hemorheological index and vWF abnormalities than men (all P<0.05). Plasma viscosity (P=0.009) and fibrinogen (P=0.0014) levels were higher in patients with more severe symptoms (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III-IV), but not with left ventricular ejection fraction. When ACE inhibitors were introduced, there was a reduction from baseline in fibrinogen (repeated measures ANOVA, P=0.016) and vWF (P=0.006). After initiation of beta-blocker therapy, there were no significant changes in haemorheological, endothelial, or platelet markers, except for an increase in mean platelet count (P<0.001); Abnormally soluble P-selectin, vWF, and hemorheological indices may contribute to the hypercoagulable state in CHF, particularly in female patients and those of the more severe NYHA class. Treatment with ACE inhibitors improved the prothrombotic status in CHF, while the addition of beta-blockers did not. These positive effects of ACE inhibitors may offer an explanation for the reduction in ischemic events observed in clinical trials.",0,0
623,11288383,Hypertension clinical guide 2000.,,,"Extensive data from many randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the benefit of treating hypertension. The target blood pressure (BP) for antihypertensive therapy should be systolic < 140 mmHg and diastolic < 90 mmHg, with minimal or no drug side effects. However, a lesser, if not optimal, reduction would be beneficial. In the elderly and those with severe hypertension, blood pressure reduction should be achieved gradually over 6 months. In patients with end-organ damage, concomitant risk factors and co-morbidities, e.g. Tighter BP control is required in diabetes mellitus. Co-existing risk factors should also be controlled; Decreased risk of stroke, heart failure, kidney failure and possibly coronary artery disease. The main precautions and contraindications for each recommended antihypertensive drug are listed. The correct BP measurement procedure is explained. Recommendations for the assessment of cardiovascular risk factors and antihypertensive therapy are stipulated. The overall cardiovascular disease risk profile should be established for all patients and this should inform management strategies. Lifestyle change and patient education play an important role in the management strategy; First line -- low dose diuretics; second line -- add one of the following: reserpine, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or calcium channel blockers; third line -- add another second line drug or hydralazine or an alpha blocker. The guideline includes the management of certain conditions, eg hypertensive emergency or urgency, severe hypertension with target organ damage and refractory hypertension (BP > 160/95 mmHg in triple therapy), hypertension in diabetes mellitus, etc.; The guide was developed by the Southern African Hypertension Society Executive Committee with consensus meeting approval and was approved by the Southern African Medical Association Guideline Committee.",0,0

625,11288962,Angiotensin receptor blockers: evidence for protecting target organs.,,"Carson, P; Giles, T; Higginbotham, M; Hollenberg, N; Kannel, W; Siragy, H M","Hypertension is a major problem across the developed world. Although current antihypertensive treatment regimens reduce morbidity and mortality, patients are often noncompliant and medications may not completely normalize blood pressure. Consequently, current therapy often does not prevent or reverse the cardiovascular remodeling that occurs when blood pressure is chronically elevated. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is effective in controlling hypertension and treating congestive heart failure. Both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibit the activity of RAS, but these two classes of antihypertensive drugs have different mechanisms of action and different pharmacological profiles. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors block a single pathway in the production of angiotensin II (Ang II). In addition, angiotensin I is not the only substrate for ACE. ACE inhibitors also block the breakdown of bradykinin, which may have potential benefits in cardiovascular disease. However, bradykinin is the putative cause of cough associated with ACE inhibitor therapy. Data from clinical trials of ACE inhibitors serve to support the role of RAS in the development of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin receptor blockers act distally in the RAS to selectively block the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor. Therefore, ARBs are more specific agents and avoid many side effects. Experimental and clinical trials have documented the efficacy of ARBs in preserving target organ function and reversing cardiovascular remodeling. In some cases, maximum benefit can be obtained with Ang II blockade using both ARBs and ACE inhibitors. This review describes clinical trials documenting the efficacy of ARBs in protecting the myocardium, blood vessels, and renal vasculature.",0,0

Comparison with dose-response data from articles listed in MEDLINE from 1966 to 2000.; For many types of drugs, physicians are often advised to use the lowest effective drug doses, especially in the beginning. However, effective lower doses identified in pre-publishment studies or post-publication studies are often excluded from PDR, even when recommended by expert panels; Optimal therapeutics depend on the availability of comprehensive information. However, the PDR only includes the limited dose information in the package inserts.

After a 4-week placebo adjustment period, nine patients with essential hypertension entered the double-blind phase of the study, which consisted of three 6-week periods in which patients were treated with placebo, enalapril 20 mg daily, or losartan 50 mg daily. od Losartan and enalapril reduced ambulatory BP over the 24-hour period from 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM. Mean nighttime blood pressure was reduced from 133/85 mm Hg on placebo to 124/78 mm Hg on enalapril and 126/77 mm Hg on losartan. Daytime blood pressure was on average 157/101 mm Hg on placebo and was significantly lower during enalapril (142/91 mm Hg) than during losartan treatment (147/95 mm Hg). Clinical BP measured 2 to 4 hours after drug ingestion was reduced to the same extent by both drugs. Losartan-induced BP changes were significantly associated with those achieved with enalapril (0.63 < r < 0.93). Outpatient blood pressure monitoring was repeated in six patients after 4 weeks of combined therapy. The blood pressure lowering effect of the combination was not significantly better than with enalapril alone. In conclusion, losartan 50 mg daily and enalapril 20 mg daily lower BP to approximately the same extent, but enalapril has a more pronounced effect on daytime ambulatory BP. The current study does not provide convincing evidence that adding losartan to enalapril at the doses used further reduces BP.",0,0
641,11319567,Effects of fosinopril or sustained-release verapamil on blood pressure and serum catecholamine concentrations in elderly hypertensive men.,,"Williams, L S; Hill, D; Davis, J; Lowenthal, D T","randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrated that 14 (78%) elderly hypertensive men in this study had an uncomplicated and beneficial response to fosinopril or verapamil. There was a well-tolerated reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DRP). There were no significant adverse drug events. With fosinopril and verapamil SR, only sitting SBP and sitting DBP were significantly reduced. These findings become even more important when considering drug selection for antihypertensive therapy in the elderly, as reductions in both SBP and DBP have been shown to be beneficial in elderly hypertensives. The increase in norepinephrine in patients treated with fosinopril may explain why patients treated with long-term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors alone or in combination with diuretics rarely complain of orthostatic symptoms.",0,0

Thus, the ACE rate for every 100 patients admitted to care was 5.5 (CI, 5.2-5.9). Additionally, in 79 (CI, 68-89) ADEs, the patient required hospitalization, resulting in an estimated acceptance rate of 3.4 (CI, 2.7-4.3) per 1000 patients. The sensitivity of search methods to identify ADEs was estimated at 58 percent (CI, 18-98) and the estimated specificity at 88 percent (CI, 87-88). The positive predictive value was 7.5 percent (CI, 6.5-8.5) and the negative predictive value was 99.2 percent (CI, 95.5-99.98). Compared with age- and sex-matched controls without positive screening, patients with ACE were twice as likely to be treated as outpatients and were taking approximately three times as many medications. Antihypertensives, ACE inhibitors, antibiotics, and diuretics were associated with 56 percent (CI, 47-65) of ADES. 23 percent (CI, 16-32) of ADEs were life-threatening or serious, and 38 percent (CI, 29-47) were considered preventable; Computerized search programs can detect ADEs, and free text searches were particularly useful. Adverse drug events were common and hospital admissions were not uncommon, but most hospitals today do not identify them.

Forty-two patients were randomized to treatment with perindopril, slow-release nifedipine, or placebo. During the first 3 months, drug dose was titrated to achieve a reduction in diastolic blood pressure of at least 5 mm HG: Thirty-three patients had at least 24 months of data and 25 patients were followed beyond 36 months (mean, 67 +/- 4 months). ). Patients were examined every 3 months and at the end of the treatment period; those who remained normotensive discontinued treatment and were followed for another 3 months. Baseline geometric mean albumin excretion rates (AERs) were as follows: perindopril, 66 microg/min; nifedipine, 59 microg/min; and placebo, 66 microg/min. During the first 3 years, 7 patients treated with perindopril but none treated with placebo or nifedipine returned to normoalbuminuria (P < 0.01). Median AERs at 3 years of treatment in each group were 23 microg/min for perindopril, 122 microg/min for nifedipine and 112 microg/min for placebo patients (P < 0.01). In patients with follow-up greater than 3 years, median AERs decreased by 45% in the first year and then stabilized in the perindopril group, but increased by 17.6% in the nifedipine group and 27.6% in the placebo group (P < 0.03) in the first year, then gradually increased thereafter.

This increased risk has been associated with increased QT dispersion (QTd), a reflection of heterogeneity in ventricular repolarization. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been reported to reduce heart size and reduce morbidity and mortality in moderate-to-severe CHF. The aim of this study was to determine whether ACE therapy is associated with a decrease in QTd, a marker of increased electrical instability. 97 patients were evaluated. After 2 months of ACE treatment, the normalized QTd decreased from 16 +/- 4 to 12 +/- 3, a 25% reduction in dispersions. QTd also decreased from 61 +/- 14 to 47 +/- 12 (P < .001) and QTc distributions decreased from 71 +/- 18 to 52 +/- 14 (P < .001).

Contrary to the original hypothesis, the benefits of angiotensin antagonism are not due to the antihypertensive effect alone. Subsequent extensive investigations of angiotensin blockade suggest that the benefits of this approach may also result from pharmacological alteration of endothelial cell function and subsequent changes in vasculature biology. The more recent discovery of direct antagonists of the AT(1) angiotensin receptor has added an element of doubt to this area of clinical decision-making. Receptor antagonists and the more widely studied converting enzyme inhibitors share many endpoint properties. However, the partially overlapping mechanisms of action for the two classes of angiotensin antagonists provide different pharmacological properties, including side-effect profiles, mechanisms of action, and theoretical potent effects on the expression of cardiovascular disease. The current review will attempt to compare the biology of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with angiotensin II receptor antagonism.

Office blood pressure was reduced in both groups, but outpatient outcomes were significantly reduced with lisinopril treatment alone. In contrast to the reduction in placebo-treated subjects, aortic distension was significantly increased with lisinopril. The main effect of increased resilience occurred between 6 and 24 months, while ambulatory blood pressure changed mainly in the first 6 months of treatment. LVMI was reduced in both treatment groups, with a significantly higher reduction in lisinopril-treated subjects. Left ventricular diastolic function did not differ significantly in both groups. Vascular pathophysiological changes (decreased aortic elasticity) of ISH may be ameliorated by long-term lisinopril therapy, whereas values worsened in placebo-treated patients. These results indicate that lisinopril treatment can positively affect the cardiovascular risk of ISH in one of the first studies involving subjects who had not previously been treated with ISH alone.",0,0
658,11336577,Amlodipine/benazepril: fixed dose combination therapy for hypertension.,,"Faulkner, M A; Hilleman, D E","Myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and end-stage renal disease have been associated with poor control of blood pressure. Despite overwhelming evidence that uncontrolled hypertension is responsible for numerous adverse health outcomes, control of the disease remains substantially sub-optimal. Available data suggest that large numbers of patients require treatment with more than one drug to achieve adequate blood pressure control. Fixed-dose combination antihypertensive therapy has many advantages over other treatment options. Positive effects on blood pressure control, compliance rates, side effects and cost were determined. Amlodipine/benazepril (Lotrel), Novartis) is a fixed-dose combination product indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Although not currently recommended as first-line therapy, studies confirm that this combination of a long-acting calcium antagonist and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has significant blood pressure lowering abilities. While adverse events tend to become more frequent with increasing doses of antihypertensive monotherapy, the rate of adverse events attributed to amlodipine/benazepril in clinical studies is often related to rates attributable to placebo. Amlodipine/benazepril is able to maintain blood pressure control over a 24-hour period and appears to be minimally affected by an occasional missed dose. Unlike older calcium antagonists, amlodipine is unlikely to cause changes in myocardial contractility. In addition, the cost of the amlodipine/benazepril combination product is lower than the same therapy administered as separate components. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider treatment with amlodipine/benazepril in eligible patients after an adequate trial of antihypertensive monotherapy.",0,0
659,11336618,The current state of antihypertensive therapies: into the new millennium.,,"Hardman, T C; Lunnon, M W","In this short review, we present a historical perspective of hypertension treatment, highlight some current issues, and look at the possible future of antihypertensive therapy. The distribution of blood pressure within the population adopts a continuous distribution, albeit somewhat skewed, but what constitutes hypertension? Traditionally, disease has been defined as a blood pressure level > 140/90 mmHg. Accepting this 'arbitrary' definition concludes that about a quarter of the adult population in the US is hypertensive [1]. This has important implications for its impact on public health. We know that treating hypertension can prevent the serious consequences of cardiovascular disease: stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, and kidney disease. Therefore, it is important to both detect and effectively lower elevated blood pressure. To what level should blood pressure be lowered? Traditionally, a level of 120/80 mmHg has been used to define normotension, but there are indications that under certain circumstances this should not be the target. The question also arises whether it matters how blood pressure is treated. The choice of agent may ultimately depend on the presence of any concomitant conditions and risk factors. Recent trial evidence has concluded that the therapy chosen to treat elevated blood pressure should take into account the patient's overall cardiovascular risk profile [2].",0,0

An up-to-date perspective on proposed hazards.,,"Kizer, J R; Kimmel, S E","In the setting of increasing popularity, post-marketing studies of calcium channel blockers have revealed an increase in several important adverse endpoints. However, the evidence was largely observational and large-scale trials that could address concerns were lacking. Clinical trials now support the safety and efficacy of long-acting dihydropyridines for patients with both uncomplicated and diabetic hypertension, but there is evidence of superior benefit to conventional treatments and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in the latter case. In contrast, short-acting dihydropyridines should be avoided. In acute coronary syndromes, beta-blockers remain the treatment of choice; Evidence for non-dihydropyridines remains inconclusive. Stable angina requires beta-blockers as first-line therapy and nondihydropyridines as second-line therapy, while safety data are lacking for nondihydropyridines in ventricular dysfunction. Initial reports of cancer, bleeding, and suicide contradicted subsequent data, making associations uncertain or probable. The remaining questions await the completion of ongoing studies to better define the indications for these agents.",0,0

667,11368252,Treatment of hypertension in women of childbearing age and during pregnancy.,,"Magee, L A","Hypertension is found in 1% to 6% of young women. Treatment aims to reduce cardiovascular risk, the magnitude of which is less dependent on absolute blood pressure (BP) than on associated cardiovascular risk factors, target organ damage due to hypertension, and/or concomitant disease. Lifestyle changes are recommended for all hypertensive individuals. The BP threshold at which antihypertensive therapy should be initiated depends on the absolute cardiovascular risk. Most young women are at low risk and do not need antihypertensive treatment. All antihypertensive agents appear to be equally effective; choice depends on personal preference, social circumstances, and the effect of an agent on cardiovascular risk factors, target organ damage, and/or co-morbidity. Although most agents are suitable for young women and well tolerated by young women, another concern is pregnancy, 50% of which are unplanned. A clinician should be aware of a woman's method of contraception and the potential for an antihypertensive agent to cause birth defects following unintentional exposure in early pregnancy. Conversely, if an oral contraceptive is effective and well tolerated, but a woman's blood pressure is slightly elevated, continuing the contraceptive and initiating antihypertensive therapy may not be contraindicated, especially if the ability to plan a pregnancy is important (eg in type 1 diabetes). Although no commonly used antihypertensives are known to be teratogenic, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists should be discontinued and any antihypertensive medication continued during pregnancy only if the expected benefits outweigh the potential reproductive risk(s). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy complicate 5% to 10% of pregnancies and are the leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Treatment aims to improve pregnancy outcome. There is consensus that severe maternal hypertension (systolic BP > or = 170 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP > or = 110 mm Hg) should be treated promptly to avoid maternal stroke, death, and possibly eclampsia. Parenteral hydralazine may be associated with a higher risk of maternal hypotension and neonatal bradycardia with intravenous labetalol. There is no consensus on whether mild to moderate hypertension in pregnancy can be treated: the risks of transient severe hypertension, antenatal hospitalization, proteinuria at birth, and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome may be reduced with treatment, but intrauterine fetal growth can also be reduced. especially by atenolol. Methyldopa and other beta-blockers have been most widely used.

We tested the hypothesis that losartan therapy added to the background of chronic (>3 months) maximal ACE inhibitor therapy (lisinopril 40 mg qd) would result in additional Ang II antagonism in patients with proteinuric chronic renal failure with hypertension. Sixteen patients with proteinuric moderately advanced chronic renal failure completed a two-period, crossover, randomized controlled trial. Each period was one month with a two-week washout between periods. In one period, lisinopril 40 mg qd was added to the patients along with other antihypertensive therapy, and in the other, losartan 50 mg qd was added to the aforementioned regimen. Hemodynamic measurements included ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABP; Spacelabs 90207), iothalamate clearances and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and cardiac output with the acetylene helium rebreathing technique. Supine plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone and 24-hour urine protein were measured in all patients.; Twelve patients had diabetic nephropathy and four had chronic glomerulonephritis.

Subtracting the mean placebo, the losartan-related change in protein excretion was +1% (95% CI, -20% to 28%, P = 0.89). Similarly, the change in systolic ambulatory blood pressure (APP) was 4.6 mm Hg (-5.7 to 14.9, P = 0.95) and diastolic ABP was 1.5 mm Hg (-4.5 to 7.6, P = 0.59). No change in cardiac output was seen.

However, while rates of successful blood pressure control among treated patients remain low, antihypertensive drugs represent a large and increasing proportion of healthcare expenditures in many countries. Various effective pharmacoeconomic analyzes have confirmed the cost-effectiveness of conventional antihypertensive treatments, which usually include monotherapy with diuretics or beta-blockers, when compared with alternative strategies. Recent studies have shown that a significant portion of the total cost of antihypertensive therapy in general practice is due to factors such as inadequate blood pressure control, poor adherence to treatment, discontinuation of treatment, and switching between treatments. These factors work to a much lesser extent in well-conducted clinical trials and are not fully included in most economic studies. Some new strategies, particularly low-dose combinations of antihypertensive agents, may offer advantages in terms of efficacy, reduced side effects, and better adherence to treatment. Therefore, comprehensive pharmacoeconomic analyzes of new strategies that take these additional factors into account are needed. Until such studies are available, the wider use of low-dose combination therapy and other novel strategies should not be delayed on the basis of previous economic studies that did not include all relevant considerations.",0,0

679,11395222,Benefits of antihypertensive drug therapy in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension.,,"Wang, J G; Staessen, J A","Isolated systolic hypertension affects more than 15% of all people over the age of 60. Systolic hypertension in the elderly is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Systolic blood pressure is associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes, whereas diastolic blood pressure is inversely proportional to total mortality independent of systolic blood pressure, highlighting the role of pulse pressure as a risk factor. Three placebo-controlled outcome studies of antihypertensive drug therapy in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension have been published: the Systolic Hypertension Program in the Elderly (SHEP), the Systolic Hypertension (Syst-Eur) Trial in Europe, and the Systolic Hypertension (Syst-China) Trial in China. These three studies demonstrated the benefit of antihypertensive drug therapy. A meta-analysis was performed combining patients from these three studies with a subgroup of patients with isolated systolic hypertension from five other studies in the elderly. Calcium channel blocker-based antihypertensive therapy may provide additional benefits in diabetic patients and in the prevention of dementia and renal dysfunction. The pooled results of 15693 elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension demonstrate that antihypertensive drug therapy is justified when systolic blood pressure is 160 mmHg or higher on repeated clinical measurements.",0,0

Perindopril 4 to 8 mg once daily significantly reduces supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline values in hypertensive patients. These reductions are maintained for at least 24 hours as evidenced by t/peak ratios of >50%. Vascular abnormalities associated with hypertension resolved or normalized during perindopril therapy. Perindopril 4 to 8 mg once daily significantly decreased carotid-femoral aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), improved arterial compliance, decreased left ventricular mass index, and significantly lowered SBP in patients with recent cerebral ischemia and/or stroke. although retained cerebral blood flow and DBP. More research is needed to determine the significance of the promising results showing that reductions in aortic PWV are associated with reduced mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease, one-third of whom receive perindopril. Response rates (number of patients with supine DBP < or = 90 mm Hg) were significantly higher with perindopril 4 to 8 mg once daily (67 to 80%) than with captopril 25 to 50 mg twice daily (44 to 57%) . randomized double-blind studies. In other clinical studies, the antihypertensive effects of perindopril were similar to those of other ACE inhibitors (including enalapril) and calcium channel antagonists. Combination therapy with perindopril and an antihypertensive agent from another treatment class provided additional benefits, either as first-line therapy or in patients who did not respond to monotherapy. Perindopril monotherapy was also effective in the elderly and in patients with hypertension and co-morbidities. Perindopril has a side-effect profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors; cough was the most common event reported during treatment and also the most common adverse event responsible for discontinuation of therapy; Perindopril is a well tolerated ACE inhibitor that is significantly better (in terms of response rates) than captopril and as effective as other ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension. Although perindopril appears to reverse some of the vascular abnormalities associated with hypertension, including arterial stiffness and left ventricular hypertrophy, more research is needed to confirm the promising results regarding its ability to reduce associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Results from ongoing studies will help confirm the place of perindopril in the treatment of hypertension; It is currently an effective and well tolerated therapy for patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.",0,0

This is important because cigarette smoke is directly toxic to endothelial cells. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to improve endothelial function in diabetes and hypercholesterolemia and are a promising option in smokers. In a randomized controlled trial, we treated 23 subjects (38+/-12 years; mean +/-SD) with lisinopril 20 mg for 8 weeks. Endothelial function was assessed by measuring forearm blood flow responses to intra-arterial infusions of endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilators and endothelium-dependent vasoconstrictors [acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, and monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), respectively] using venous. occlusion plethysmography. Lisinopril reduced the forearm blood flow response to acetylcholine by 20% [lisinopril, 3.12+/-0.37 (mean+/-SEM); placebo, 2.58+/-0.25; P=0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09, 1.06] (values given are flow ratios in the control arm to flow in the infused arm); there was no effect on response to sodium nitroprusside (lisinopril, 3.97+/-0.40; placebo, 3.92+/-0.39; P=0.84; 95% CI -0.50, 0.61).

In conclusion, these results suggest that ACE inhibition can improve endothelial function in smokers. We showed that lisinopril ameliorates both receptor-mediated and tonic NO release. The mechanism may be that either lisinopril limits the production of angiotensin II-induced superoxide radicals that would normally inactivate NO, or that lisinopril may increase bradykinin-mediated NO release.",0,0

691,11416681,Selection of initial antihypertensive drug therapy for the uncomplicated hypertensive patient.,,"Moore, M A","Choosing the first antihypertensive drug for the uncomplicated hypertensive patient is an important and frequent event for the primary care physician. Patients' initial experiences with antihypertensive drug therapy will likely influence their perception of long-term hypertension treatment. The choice should be made on the basis of sound scientific data and taking into account the patient's perspective and needs. The drug should be taken once a day, should have proven efficacy in controlling hypertension and reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and should have as few side effects as possible. Low-dose thiazide diuretics meet this definition, but the need to monitor electrolytes may make them less than ideal. The angiotensin II receptor antagonist class, with side effects similar to placebo in controlled trials, is the most attractive from the patient's point of view, but conclusive trial data are not yet available proving that treatment of hypertension with angiotensin II receptor antagonists reduces cardiovascular events. With their low side-effect profile and unique effects on vascular remodeling, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists are attractive second options for combining with a diuretic if necessary, although low-dose diuretic/Beta-blocker combinations have also been used. It has been shown to lower blood pressure with minimal side effects. At present, achieving adequate long-term hypertension control is the most important aspect of hypertensive care, and which antihypertensive drug(s) the physician chooses can greatly affect the hypertensive patient's ability to achieve and maintain long-term blood pressure control.

Also, 8 out of 17 control subjects required treatment with blood pressure-lowering drugs because they developed hypertension. Fractional albumin clearance (x10-5) remained unchanged in the captopril group: baseline [10.8 (1.25) geometric mean and antilog (SEM)] over eight years [11.8 (1.47)], a significant increase occurred in control patients: 13.3 (1.23) to 26.2 (1.42) (P < 0.05). Baseline GFR was almost the same: 111 (6) and 115 (4) mL/min/1.73 m2 in the captopril and control groups, respectively. The median (range) rate of decline in GFR (mL/min/year) was 1.7 (10.7 to -2.0) in the captopril group compared to 2.8 (17.7 to -2.6) in the control group (P = NS); The beneficial effect of captopril in stopping the increase in systemic blood pressure and albuminuria is long-lasting. Most patients with diabetic nephropathy have minimal loss of GFR if normotension is maintained on prospective therapy with ACE inhibitors or if hypertension develops and improves with administration of other antihypertensive drugs.",0,0

Study drug was withdrawn after all patients were treated with captopril (target dose: 25 mg twice daily), diuretics, and study drug (target dose: 40 mg isosorbide dinitrate or placebo twice daily) for 16 weeks. Patients then continued to receive fixed doses of captopril and diuretics throughout a 6-week abstinence period. Radionuclide ventriculography with right heart catheterization was performed at rest and during supine cycling exercise after 16 weeks of double-blind treatment and at the end of the 6-week abstinence period; Changes in resting parameters following discontinuation of study drug were not different between groups. At the comparable maximum workload (placebo group 68 +/- 15 W, nitrate group 68 +/- 20 W), nitrate withdrawal resulted in a reduction in ejection fraction (placebo withdrawal: +0.8 +/- 4.0%; nitrate withdrawal: -2.7 + /- 4.3%, p < 0.02) and increases in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (-9 +/- 35 vs. 23 +/- 48 ml, p < 0.02) and end-systolic volume (-9 +/-) 33' e vs +24 +/- 47 ml; p < 0.01).; The addition of nitrates to initial therapy with captopril and diuretics may reduce exercise-induced left ventricular dilatation in patients with heart failure from coronary disease.",0,0

After prior antihypertensive treatments were ""washed out"", patients entered a 2-week placebo break-in period to confirm the diagnosis of mild to moderate hypertension. At the end of the placebo acclimation period, patients with a mean sitting diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 115 mmHg (inclusive) received valsartan 80 mg once daily for 4 weeks. Nonresponders (who did not show a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more compared to baseline) received valsartan 160 mg qd for an additional 4 weeks. In selected centres, accepting patients had their blood pressure monitored for 24 hours, provided that their blood pressure was shown to be controlled. Half of these patients missed a dose of valsartan and were followed for an additional 24 hours; The response rate to valsartan 80 mg was 45.4%, and 36.3% of those who did not respond to this dose responded to 160 mg of valsartan. The response rate to one or the other dose was 63.2%. Ambulatory blood pressure data support a consistent reduction in blood pressure with valsartan over a 24-hour period and up to 32 hours after dosing in those who miss a dose. The overall incidence of treatment-related or otherwise adverse experiences per person-year was 6.3 and 10.6 for the valsartan and placebo study periods, respectively; Antihypertensive treatment with valsartan for 8 weeks resulted in a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients.

700,11434450,Combination therapy versus monotherapy as first-line treatment of uncomplicated arterial hypertension.,,"Ruzicka, M; Leenen, F H","Mild to moderate hypertension is still not well controlled. This is related to many factors, including the low antihypertensive efficacy of single-drug therapies, the reluctance of primary care physicians to change/titrate the initially chosen therapy to achieve target blood pressure, and poor adherence to medication. Several guidelines for the treatment of high blood pressure include combination therapy with 2 drugs at low doses as one of the strategies for the initial treatment of mild/moderate arterial hypertension. The evidence discussed in this article points to superior control of blood pressure with combinations of low doses of the 2 drugs compared to regular doses of monotherapy. This superior efficacy of the combined therapy results in better antihypertensive efficacy and higher response rates in the low dose range as a result of complementary mechanisms of antihypertensive effects, and better tolerance than the simple drug regimen as a result of a lower rate of side effects in the lower dose range. good fit and lower cost.

701,11434453,barnidipine.,,"Malhotra, H S; Plosker, G L","Bamidipine is an antihypertensive drug belonging to the dihydropyridine (DHP) group of calcium antagonists. It is available in a modified-release formulation that has a gradual onset of action and is effective at a single daily oral dose of 10 to 20 mg. Bamidipine has a selective effect against cardiovascular calcium antagonist receptors and its antihypertensive effect is associated with a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance secondary to its vasodilatory effect. The clinical antihypertensive efficacy of barnidipine is similar to that of other DHP calcium antagonists such as nitrendipine and amlodipine, and antihypertensives from other drug classes such as atenolol and enalapril. Barnidipine has been found to be as effective and well tolerated as hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of hypertension in elderly patients. Barnidipine is generally well tolerated. As with other DHP calcium antagonists, vasodilator adverse events such as headache, flushing, and peripheral edema are responsible for the majority of adverse events reported with its use and are usually transient. Edema is less common than with amlodipine and nitrendipine. Its use is not associated with reflex tachycardia.",0,0

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate changes in left ventricular (LV) myocardial mass as well as diastolic filling characteristics in hypertensive patients treated with the ACE inhibitor fosinopril. 16 hypertensive patients with echocardiographically documented LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction received fosinopril (10-20 mg daily). Measurements of left ventricular myocardial mass and characteristics of diastolic filling (peak filling fraction (PFF); peak filling rate (PFR)) were made using cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before drug treatment and also after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Ten healthy subjects served as the control group. LV myocardial mass (g/m2) was consistently reduced by 32% within 3-6 months after follow-up (148 +/- 40 vs. 120 +/- 26 vs. 101 +/- 22 g/m2; P < 0.0001/ 0.005).

Valsartan (160 mg/day), both a low-salt (-6.4/-4.8 mm Hg: P < .001) and high-salt diet (-4.9/-3.8 mm Hg: P = .01). The high salt diet slightly reduced the antihypertensive effect (1.6/1.3 mm Hg, P = not significant). When comparing the efficacy of the three randomized therapeutic regimens during Na+ supplementation, valsartan 160 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg was the most effective treatment with a gradual reduction in blood pressure of -10.5/-6.9 mm Hg (P < .01), valsartan 160 mg/day alone. Compared with. Doubling the dose of valsartan to 320 mg gradually lowered blood pressure by -3.8/-3.3 mm Hg (P = not significant). The least effective approach was the addition of 20 mg/day benazepril to 160 mg/day valsartan, with an incremental reduction in systolic blood pressure and only a 1.7 mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure (P = not significant). In our open-label pilot study, we concluded that the antihypertensive activity of valsartan in hypertensive African Americans was not significantly reduced by a fortified salt diet. Moreover, adding a low dose of HCTZ rather than doubling the dose or adding an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor appears to be the most effective strategy for increasing the antihypertensive activity of this angiotensin II receptor blocker.",0,0
715,11465654,Could the antihypertensive response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition predict the antihypertensive response to angiotensin receptor antagonism?,,"Stergiou, G S; Skeva, I I; Baibas, N M; Kalkana, C B; Roussias, L G; Mountokalakis, T D","To test the hypothesis that an antihypertensive response to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition might predict response to angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) antagonism, 33 hypertensive patients were randomized to receive either lisinopril (20 mg) or losartan (50 mg). 5 weeks. Patients then switched to alternative therapy for a second 5-week period. Twenty-four hour ambulatory BP (ABP) was measured before randomization and on the last day of each period. Agreement in ABP response between the two drugs was assessed using the following approaches: Subjects were classified as responders and non-responders using an arbitrary level of response as a threshold (ACP reduction > or = 10 mm Hg systolic or > or = 5 mm Hg diastolic), or whether drugs median ABP response obtained by each. In the responder-non-responder classification, the discrepancy between the two drugs was expressed as the proportion of subjects whose ABP responded to only one of the drugs. Lisinopril was more effective than losartan in reducing ABP (mean difference 4.7+/-8.1/3.3+/-5.7 mm Hg, systolic/diastolic, P < .05). Discordant antihypertensive response between the two drugs was found in 39/33% of subjects for systolic/diastolic ABP, with arbitrary response criteria (33/39% using median response criteria). Significant correlations were found between responses to lisinopril and losartan (r = 0.47/0.59, systolic/diastolic, P < .01). We concluded that in more than one-third of hypertensive subjects, the BP response to ACE inhibition did not predict the response to AT1R antagonism and vice versa. These data suggest that there are differences between these two classes of drugs that are not only of theoretical but also of practical importance.",0,0

Combination therapy aims to improve overall therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects. In well-designed multicenter clinical studies, perindopril/indapamide at doses ranging from 2/0.625 to 8/2.5 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving adequate blood pressure (BP) control. A similar reduction in supine blood pressure was observed with perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day compared to losartan 50 mg/day or atenolol 50 mg/day. Similar reductions in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure were seen with perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day and irbesartan 150 mg/day. However, response and normalization rates were significantly higher with combination therapy than with losartan or irbesartan monotherapy. Combined perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day treatment effectively reduced blood pressure in elderly patients aged 65 to 85 years, significantly more than atenolol 50 mg/day or placebo. In a small non-comparative study of patients with hypertension and kidney failure, supine blood pressure also returned to normal in about two-thirds of patients. Low dose perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day was well tolerated in clinical studies; The most common side effects were headache and cough. Hypokalaemia due to the use of diuretics occurred with a higher incidence with the combined treatment of perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day compared to atenolol 50 mg/day or placebo. Perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day demonstrated efficacy in well-designed comparative studies with atenolol, losartan, and irbesartan, including elderly patients and patients with renal impairment. Studies comparing this perindopril/indapamide dosage with other combination therapies would be useful in allowing more accurate localization of perindopril/indapamide. The fixed-low dose combination of perindopril/indapamide offers a promising and well tolerated treatment option for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension.",0,0
717,11468010,Role of bradykinin and tachykinins in potentiation of citric acid-induced cough in pigs by enalapril.,,"Moreaux, B; Advenier, C; Gustin, P","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are among the drugs of first choice in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart disease. However, it has been reported that these drugs can cause chronic cough and airway hypersensitivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of bradykinin and tachykinins on citric acid-induced cough after ACE inhibitor pretreatment in pigs. Cough was induced by challenging the pigs with an aerosol of 0.8 M citric acid for 15 minutes. Coughs were counted for 30 minutes by a trained observer. Two cough induction tests were performed on the animals, two days apart (days 1 and 3), the first as a control. All drugs were injected intravenously 30 minutes before the second loading. No difference was observed between the 1st and 3rd days in the control group. The ACE inhibitor enalapril (7.5 and 15 microg/kg) caused a significant increase in cough frequency. In contrast, a dose-dependent reduction was observed with Hoe140 (icatibant) (0.5 and 1 mg/kg), a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. When both drugs were administered simultaneously (15 microg/kg for enalapril and 1 mg/kg for Hoe140), a significant increase was observed compared to the control value obtained on day 1. When enalapril is combined with the three tachykinin receptor antagonist SR 140333. (NK1 receptor antagonist), SR 48968 (NK2 receptor antagonist) and SR 142801 (NK3 receptor antagonist), a significant decrease was observed compared to the control value obtained on day 1; The percentage of variation was also significantly different when compared to that observed in the enalapril groups at both doses. These data suggest that the ACE-inhibitor-induced enhancement of the cough reflex in our pig model was mainly due to tachykinins and not bradykinin. However, bradykinin only plays an important role in cough caused by citric acid.",0,0

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a known risk factor. After renal transplantation, persistent hypertension is an important determinant for the further evolution of LVH. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril) with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) (controlled-release nifedipine) in the treatment of posttransplant hypertension, focusing on changes in LVH. One hundred and fifty-four kidney transplant recipients presenting with hypertension (diastolic BP > or =95 mmHg) within the first 3 weeks after transplant were randomized to double-blind nifedipine 30 mg or lisinopril 10 mg once daily; One hundred twenty-three patients completed 1 year of treatment.

Twelve patients were allocated to treatment with either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (group 1, six subjects) or a beta-receptor blocker (group 2, six subjects). A comparable group of nine patients not receiving antihypertensive therapy provided reference values (group 3, nine subjects). Renal biopsies were obtained at baseline and after a median of 40 months (groups 1 and 2) and 30 months (group 3). Using light microscopy with 1 microm serial sections of plastic embedded biopsies, JGA and glomerulus volumes and macula densa and lumina areas of afferent and efferent arterioles were obtained; A significant reduction in the volume of the JGA (P=0.026) and the volume of the JGA relative to the volume of the corresponding glomeruli (P=0.0005) was noted only in the reference group. There was a negative correlation between the increase in afferent arteriolar lumen area and mean diastolic blood pressure in groups 1 (P=0.024) and group 2 (P=0.032) during the study period; Our results showed that a reduction in JGA size was offset by antihypertensives. The negative correlation between the change in luminal area of the afferent arteriole and mean diastolic blood pressure in groups 1 and 2 suggests that renal protection in antihypertensive therapy may be via better constriction of the afferent arteriole, which protects the glomerulus from systemic blood pressure.",0,0

Six of these drugs are already licensed in Europe and the United States for the treatment of high blood pressure, and additional candidates are in the pipeline. The World Health Organization has also recently approved their use for this condition. As AT1 receptor antagonists have proven themselves to be equivalent to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in antihypertensive efficacy but exhibit better safety profiles, this class of drugs can be considered a qualitative improvement in the treatment of essential hypertension. Interestingly, the six agents currently commercially available differ significantly in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, although it is unclear whether such differences are clinically relevant. A significant number of large, multicenter studies are ongoing to determine the possible long-term organoprotective effects of these substances on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Therefore, there has been great interest in the therapeutic potential of the natriuretic peptide system. Various approaches have been explored, including the use of natural peptides, the development of natriuretic peptide mimetics, and the targeting of endogenous clearance of natriuretic peptides. While the application of ANP and BNP may be valuable in some situations, the limitations of using peptides, especially for long-term therapy, are clear. In light of this, great effort has been devoted to the development of orally active agents to potentiate endogenous natriuretic peptides through inhibition of degradation by neutral endopeptidase. This research has now led to vasopeptidase inhibitors, which are dual inhibitors of both endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme. These agents clearly provide a novel approach to improve endogenous natriuretic peptide function against a background of reduced angiotensin II activity and could lead to a significant advance in the treatment of hypertension and conditions associated with excessive salt and water overload.",0,0

A prospective, randomized, 12-week study in 138 previously treated hypertensive subjects in which 67 of them replaced usual therapy (UC) with perindopril (P) therapy. Major artery features were evaluated as central arterial pressure increase determined by applanation tonometry of the radial artery and a transfer function. At baseline, both magnification index (AI, %) and pressure (AP, mm Hg) were associated with body size, heart rate, and gender. In addition, AP was associated with age and systolic blood pressure (BP). After 12 weeks of treatment, AP was significantly reduced in both the perindopril and UC groups, while AI was only significantly reduced (151.7+/-2.3 to 144.9+/-2.6%) in those treated with perindopril.

At 12 weeks, AI was negatively correlated with heart rate, but the regression slopes for the association were almost identical for the perindopril and UC groups.

735,11498653,Management of high-risk hypertensive patients with diabetes: potential role of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.,,"Weber, M A; Weir, M R","Uncontrolled hypertension leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. The risk of cardiovascular complications is even greater in hypertensive patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes; furthermore, this high-risk patient population is at high risk for kidney disease and ultimately kidney failure. Prospective morbidity and mortality studies have shown that tight blood pressure control improves cardiovascular prognosis and provides target organ protection. Current treatment guidelines recommend a target blood pressure of <130/85 mm Hg for patients with hypertension and diabetes. Angiotensin II (A-II), an important component of the renin-angiotensin system, plays an important role in the pathophysiology of hypertension and diabetes-related kidney disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is currently the treatment of choice for hypertensive patients with diabetes, but most data are limited to patients with type 1 diabetes. Although ACE inhibition is clearly a mechanism for blocking A-II formation, inhibition at this site may not be complete as alternative pathways for A-II formation exist. Thus, for disrupting the renin-angiotensin system, A-II receptor antagonists theoretically offer advantages over ACE inhibitors in that they directly inhibit A-II by binding to the AT(1) receptor subtype. The objectives of this review are: 1) to provide an overview of the risk of cardiovascular complications associated with co-existing hypertension and diabetes; 2) demonstrate the cardiovascular benefits of effective blood pressure control in this patient population; 3) review current treatment guidelines for managing high-risk hypertensive patients; and 4) discusses ongoing major clinical trials with A-II receptor antagonists in patients with co-existing hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and kidney disease.

A 3-year interim analysis of the AASK revealed the renoprotective effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril compared to the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (DHP-CCB) amlodipine in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. This differential effect was independent of achieved blood pressure (BP) levels and was evident in proteinuric patients and was suggestive but inconclusive in patients with baseline proteinuria <300 mg/d. AASK trial data suggest that DHP-CCBs should be used with caution in the presence of mild to moderate renal impairment. The use of other MCCs, such as verapamil or diltiazem, should be decided upon, as they are fundamentally different MCCs with a different potential for action on hypertensive nephrosclerosis. The blind observation period for the AASK will be completed by the end of September 2001, during which time additional clinically useful information is expected to become available.

Simple trick.,,,(1) The combination perindopril 4 mg + indapamide 1.25 mg is approved for the second-line treatment of hypertension after failure of perindopril alone. (2) Another combination containing a low-dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (2 mg perindopril) and a diuretic (0.625 mg indapamide) is introduced as first-line therapy for hypertension. (3) Clinical files for both preparations are limited to a strict minimum. (4) A dose finding study showed that the perindopril 4 mg + indapamide 1.25 mg dose combination offered the best risk-benefit ratio when compared to combinations containing the same perindopril dose but other doses of indapamide. (5) A double-blind study suggests that the antihypertensive activity of the combination perindopril 4 mg + indapamide 1.25 mg is equivalent to that of the combinations captopril 50 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and enalapril 20 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg. The security profile was the same for the three combinations. (6) The combination of 2 mg perindopril was not compared with the usual dose of 4 mg perindopril monotherapy or with indapamide monotherapy at a mean dose of 2.5 mg.

Doses of amlodipine (2.5-10 mg once daily) and enalapril (5-20 mg once daily) were titrated to reduce office blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg during 8 weeks of treatment. Both drugs were similarly effective in lowering blood pressure, and target blood pressure was achieved in 72.4% of amlodipine-treated patients and 67.4% of enalapril-treated patients. Also, the degree of lowering blood pressure was similar in both groups. Compared to baseline values: systolic/diastolic blood pressure decreased by 23.5/14.9 mm Hg in the amlodipine group and 23.2/14.0 mm Hg in patients receiving enalapril. However, side effects, particularly dry cough, were more common in enalapril-treated patients. Both amlodipine and enalapril provide significant blood pressure reduction in stage I-II hypertension. Tolerance to short-term therapy was good in both groups, but the number of adverse events was significantly lower in patients treated with amlodipine.",0,0

However, this effect seems to decrease over time. In addition, long-term use of ramipril has been shown to reduce the risk of end-stage renal disease in proteinuric diabetic and non-diabetic chronic nephropathy. We planned a long-term unblinded, prospective, centrally randomized, controlled, multicenter study to evaluate whether combined treatment of steroid and ramipril was superior to ramipril alone in patients with progressive IgAN disease. At least 134 patients with biopsy-proven IgAN, grade G3 or G4, proteinuria > 1.0 g daily, and creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min will be enrolled over a 2-year recruitment period.

744,11509470,Iron supplementation prevents cough associated with ACE inhibitors.,,"Lee, S C; Park, S W; Kim, D K; Lee, S H; Hong, K P","Dry cough is the most common limiting factor for ACE inhibitor (ACEI) use. Production of NO, a proinflammatory substance, in bronchial epithelial cells is increased by ACEI. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we tested the hypothesis that iron supplementation, an inhibitor of NO synthase, can reduce ACEI-induced cough. Subjects were 19 patients who developed an ACEI-induced cough. After a 2-week observation period, they were randomized to a daily morning dose of 256 mg ferrous sulfate as a tablet or placebo for a 4-week treatment period. Subjects were asked to complete a cough diary by scoring the daily severity of cough from 0 to 4. Mean daily cough scores were compared for the last week of the observation and treatment period. Changes in blood cell count and serum iron and ferritin concentrations between the 2 periods were evaluated. Mean daily cough scores during the observation and treatment periods were 3.07+/-0.70 and 1.69+/-1.10 for the iron group and 2.57+/-0.80 and 2.35+/-1.22 for the placebo group, respectively. a significant reduction in cough scores (P<0.01) with iron supplementation, but not with placebo. Three subjects in the iron group showed almost complete disappearance of cough. No significant changes were observed in laboratory data in either group. In conclusion, iron supplementation successfully reduces ACEI-induced cough. This effect may be related to the reduction of NO formation associated with inhibition of NO synthase activity in bronchial epithelial cells.",0,0

It is unknown whether these changes are affected by clonidine. We measured mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and venous pressure in 26 normotensive patients 58.0+/-1.1 years old (mean +/-SEM) afflicted with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class II or III) and treated with furosemide and enalapril. plasma norepinephrine and muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (microneurography) at rest and during baroreceptor stimulation and deactivation caused by gradual intravenous infusions of phenylephrine and nitroprusside, respectively. Measurements were repeated in a double-blind, randomized order after 2 months of administration of a transdermal clonidine patch (14 patients) or placebo (12 patients). Clonidine caused a slight, non-significant decrease in mean arterial pressure and heart rate without affecting exercise capacity and echocardiographically determined left ventricular ejection fraction. In contrast, both plasma norepinephrine and sympathetic nerve traffic were significantly reduced (-46.8% and -26.7 percent, respectively; P<0.01 for both). This reduction was combined with no change in cardiac and sympathetic baroreflex responses. Transdermal placebo administration over a 2-month period did not affect any of the above-mentioned variables. Thus, in congestive heart failure patients receiving conventional drug therapy, chronic administration of clonidine exerts pronounced sympathoinhibitory effects without adversely affecting cardiac function and clinical status. Whether this leads to further therapeutic benefits remains to be tested.",0,0

Thirty-day mortality in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, and Latin America was 6.7%, 7.3%, 5.7%, 10.1%, P<0.0001. Adjusted mortality for Europe was intermediate between North America and Latin America (odds ratios (OR) [95% confidence intervals (CI)], compared to Western Europe: North America 0.84 [0.67-1.0], Eastern Europe 1.2 [1.0- 1.4], and Latin America 1.8 [1.3-2.7]). Revascularization rates varied 10-fold but did not explain regional mortality differences. Germany and the United Kingdom had a similar adjusted 1-year mortality rate (OR 1.16 for England [0.92-1.5]), but invasive procedures were four to 10 times more common in Germany. Similarly, the USA and Canada had an equally adjusted 1-year mortality despite three times higher use of invasive procedures in the USA (OR 0.85 [0.61-1.17] for Canada); Significant geographic differences in practice and adjusted mortality after fibrinolysis persist despite recent guidelines.

747,11515986,Diabetes patients with hypertension uncontrolled with ACE inhibitors: alternative treatments.,,"Cleophas, T J; van Ouwerkerk, B M; van der Meulen, J; Zwinderman, A H","In patients with type II diabetes, a beta-blocker is often added as second-line therapy if hypertension is not adequately controlled by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i). Recently, large randomized studies have demonstrated the beneficial effect of second-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in these patients. These compounds are increasingly used to replace beta blockers. Discontinuation of beta-blockers may affect diabetic control and cause rebound hypertension. If the beta blocker is replaced by a calcium channel blocker, any rebound hypertension from discontinuation of the beta blocker may not occur. A calcium channel blocker affects vascular resistance (VR) and blood pressure differently than a beta blocker. 34 patients with type II diabetes who had a resting diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg despite being on enalapril 10 mg daily (or equivalent doses of other ACE-i) for at least 3 months, with the same ACE-i, beta-blocker metoprolol 100 mg in combination for 3 months followed by 10 mg once daily with the same ACE-i in combination with the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker lercanidipine. After 6 weeks, patients with diastolic blood pressure above 90 mm Hg were titrated to 200 mg metoprolol or 20 mg lercanidipine once daily. Patients were examined every 6 weeks during the trial and 2 weeks after taking lercanidipine. In addition to blood pressure measurements, VR was measured by iridium strain gauge plethysmography and expressed in units (1 unit = 1 mm Hg/mL blood/100 mL tissue per minute). Two of 34 patients did not complete the protocol in the first 2 weeks of treatment due to non-compliance with lercanidipine treatment. Its data is included in the analysis. No rebound hypertension was observed 14 days after changing treatments. (Mean arterial pressures [MAPs] were not significantly different from the point at which beta-blockers were released.) However, heart rate increased from 69+/-7 to 94+/-10 bpm (p < 0.001). After 3 months with lercanidipine, MAP decreased by 6+/-10 mm Hg (p = 0.002) compared to the beta-blocker cut-off point. Vascular resistance decreased 6.28+/-11.91 units (p<0.01), while glucosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) increased 0.4+/-0.5% (p<0.001) and body weight 0.6+/-0.6 kg (p<0.01)). Multiple regression analysis revealed significant associations between the decrease in VR, increase in HbAlc, and decrease in MAP and the partial dependence of these variables on each other. In hypertensive patients with type II diabetes, replacement of ACE-i and metoprolol with ACE-i and lercanidipine does not significantly affect metabolic control and does not cause rebound hypertension. Lercanidipine was more effective than metoprolol as a second-line antihypertensive drug in these patients. At least two mechanisms may be involved: withdrawal of a suppressive effect from the beta-blocker and calcium channel-mediated vasodilation.",0,0

Two control groups of 10 patients each were used. Control 1 group with normal renal function and control 2 group with normokalaemia and renal failure of the same size as hyperkalemic patients. Serum osmolarity, electrolytes, creatinine, aldosterone and urinary electrolytes and osmolarity were measured and TTKG was calculated; DIH patients had lower BCCI values than control 1 patients (2.58 +/- 0.36 vs. 6.68 +/- 0.55, p < 0.001) as well as control 2 patients (2.58 +/- 0.36 vs. 5.51 +/). - 0.87, p < 0.01).

The beneficial effect in slowing the progression of kidney disease is greater in patients with high urinary protein excretion at the start of treatment. We hypothesized that the greater beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on the progression of kidney disease in patients with higher baseline proteinuria was due to their greater antiproteinuric effect in these patients. Data from 1860 patients enrolled in 11 randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of antihypertensive regimens, including ACE inhibitors, on the progression of nondiabetic kidney disease with regimens without ACE inhibitors were analyzed. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between baseline proteinuria level and changes in urinary protein excretion during follow-up. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between changes in urinary protein excretion during follow-up and the effect of ACE inhibitors on doubling time from baseline serum creatinine values or onset of end-stage renal disease; The mean (median) baseline urinary protein excretion was 1.8 (0.94) g/day. Patients with higher baseline urinary protein excretion values had a greater reduction in proteinuria associated with treatment with ACE inhibitors and lowering of systolic and diastolic blood pressures during follow-up (interaction P < 0.001 for all). A higher urinary protein excretion level (baseline minus change) during follow-up was associated with a greater risk of progression [relative risk 5.56 (3.87 to 7.98) for each 1.0 g/day higher protein excretion]. After controlling for the current level of urinary protein excretion, the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors remained significant [relative risk for control versus ACE inhibitors 0.66 (0.52 to 0.83)], but there was no significant interaction between the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors. and the baseline level of urinary protein excretion; The antiproteinuric effects and blood pressure lowering of ACE inhibitors are greater in patients with higher basal urinary protein excretion. The greater beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on the progression of kidney disease in patients with higher baseline proteinuria may be explained by their higher antiproteinuric effect in these patients. The current level of urinary protein excretion is a modifiable risk factor for the progression of nondiabetic kidney disease. ACE inhibitors provide greater beneficial effects at all levels of urinary protein excretion present.",0,0

In vivo and in vitro degradation by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is responsible for the high plasma concentrations of AcSDKP in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. Because ACE inhibitors can induce anemia in some patients, we measured plasma AcSDKP concentrations in 176 patients with chronic renal failure: 120 on hemodialysis (HD) and 56 non-dialysis (nD) patients, 39 of whom received ACE inhibitors. We examined the relationships between AcSDKP levels, hematological parameters, and requirements for recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in these patients. AcSDKP levels were significantly higher in HD (10.3 +/- 3.9 pmol/mL) and nD (3.1 +/- 1.8 pmol/mL) patients without ACE inhibitors compared to controls (1.8 +/- 0.2 pmol/mL). In all patients, treatment with ACE inhibitors significantly increased these levels by a factor of four. HD sessions significantly reduced AcSDKP concentrations by 66% and reduced the in vitro half-life of AcSDKP (270 +/- 109 minutes) to values that were not significantly different from controls or nD patients (182 +/- 67 minutes). Most HD patients treated with ACE inhibitors had AcSDKP levels greater than 24 pmol/mL (the highest concentration found in other nD and HD patients). Only in this patient group, weekly doses of rHuEPO correlated with AcSDKP levels. Our results demonstrate that renal function is essential to maintain stable AcSDKP plasma levels and that high levels of AcSDKP act as a uremic toxin that causes partial resistance to erythropoietin and inhibits erythropoiesis.",0,0

The incidence of these reactions among hospitalized patients ranges from 1% to 3%. The frequency of cutaneous reactions to certain drugs may exceed 10%. These reactions can range from mildly bothersome to life-threatening. Anti-infective and anticonvulsant agents are among the drugs most commonly associated with skin adverse reactions. We describe and illustrate the clinical morphology of the most common cutaneous drug reactions, as well as the drugs most commonly precipitating specific reactions. The diverse nature of the reactions that occur even with specific agents indicates the multiple mechanisms by which cutaneous drug reactions can be initiated. While various terms have been proposed to classify skin drug reactions, we suggest that reactions are best defined based on mechanisms where they are known. In this review, we evaluate the available information on four categories of cutaneous drug reactions: immediate immune-mediated reactions, delayed-type immune-mediated reactions, photosensitivity reactions, and autoimmune syndromes. We also describe the evidence that viral infection is an important predisposing factor for the development of cutaneous drug reactions upon drug administration. Finally, we review the available knowledge on the type and mechanisms of cutaneous drug reactions for various drug categories.",0,0

756,11548874,The renin-angiotensin system plays a role in the mechanism of increased serum asymmetric dimethylarginine in essential hypertension.,,"Ito, A; Egashira, K; Narishige, T; Muramatsu, K; Takeshita, A","Endothelium-dependent/nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation is impaired in hypertensive individuals. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase, is synthesized by many cell types, including vascular endothelial cells. Serum ADMA levels are increased in patients with essential hypertension, but the mechanism of this increase is unknown. Therefore, the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was examined in this study. Patients with essential hypertension [systolic blood pressure (BP) > 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 95 mmHg] were assigned to an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment group (perindopril, 4 mg/day for 4 weeks, n = 7) randomized. ), an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist treatment group (losartan, 50 mg/day for 4 weeks, n = 7), or a beta-blocker treatment group (bisoprolol, 5 mg/day for 4 weeks, n = 7 ) . Before and after treatment, BP, serum ADMA concentration, and plasma concentration of von Willebrand factor (vWF, a biological marker of endothelial damage) were measured. Perindopril, losartan, and bisoprolol reduced BP to a similar extent, and perindopril or losartan, but not bisoprolol, significantly reduced serum ADMA and plasma vWF. These findings suggest that RAS may contribute to the mechanism of increased serum ADMA as well as endothelial damage observed in hypertensive patients. The vasculoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors or AT1 receptor antagonists may be explained, at least in part, by amelioration of endothelial damage through a reduction in serum ADMA concentration.",0,0

In this study, the authors report a case of a patient affected by hypertension. After submission, the authors began antihypertensive therapy using captopril, which caused a significant elevation of amylase and lipase within 13 days. When ACE inhibitor therapy was discontinued, a rapid decrease in serum enzyme was observed within 3 days. Elevated serum amylase and lipase levels were associated with neutrophilia, but not with relevant symptomatic signs or features of pancreatopathy. The absence of usual conditions that could cause pancreatitis, such as biliary stasis, hypercalcemia, or alcohol abuse, and the rapid decrease in serum enzyme levels after drug suspension suggested an ACE inhibitor-induced pancreatitis. This is the first clinical report of ACE inhibitor-induced pancreatitis in which captopril administration was detected after hospitalization. The drug suspension likely prevented other complications.

While blood cholesterol status did not affect the carotid effects of trandolapril, patients with low and high cholesterol treated with nitrendipine exhibited significant differences in drug effects on (a) systolic and pulse pressures (p < 0.05), which were reduced in patients with low cholesterol (p < 0.01, p < 0.05) but not in those with high cholesterol; (b) diastolic diameter, which increased insignificantly in patients with low cholesterol but remained unchanged in patients with high cholesterol (p = 0.05); and (c) wall viscosity (p < 0.01), which decreased in patients with low cholesterol (p < 0.05) but increased insignificantly in patients with high cholesterol. In addition, wall viscosity change under nitrendipine was positively associated with baseline blood cholesterol (r = 0.64, p < 0.01). Thus, nitrendipine and trandolapril show notable differences in their effects on the carotid artery, particularly with regard to blood cholesterol status, although these differences should be confirmed in larger studies.",0,0

Patients were randomly given 10-20 mg of manidipine or 5-10 mg of amlodipine once a day for 48 weeks. Patients who did not respond to treatment after 12 weeks were also given 10-20 mg of enalapril throughout the study period. The main efficacy endpoint was equivalence in sitting systolic (SiSBP) and diastolic (SiDBP) blood pressure reduction between the two drugs after 8 weeks (based on protocol analysis). An intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed in all patients with at least one efficacy determination during treatment. Quality of life was assessed with the ""Subjective Symptom Assessment Profile"" (SSA-P) and ""General Health Program"" (GWBS) after 12 weeks of treatment. After 8 weeks, the SiSBP reduction was equivalent for manidipine (15.2 mm Hg, n = 227) and amlodipine (17.0 mm Hg, n = 219). The corresponding figure for SiDBP was 11.3 mm Hg for manidipine and 12.3 mm Hg for amlodipine. In the larger ITT population, SiDBP was inhibited by manidipine (102 +/- 5 to 88 +/- 9 mm Hg, n = 241) and amlodipine (101 +/- 5 to 87 +/- 8 mm Hg). similar and significantly decreased. , n = 240). Similar results were observed for SiSBP and ambulatory SBP and DBP. No drug changed sitting or standing heart rate compared to baseline. SSA-P scores improved with manidipine but not with amlodipine. GWBS total and partial scores increased more with manidipine than with amlodipine. The safety profile was in favor of manidipine, which was associated with significantly less ankle edema than amlodipine. This study demonstrates for the first time that long-term treatment with the long-acting calcium channel blocker manidipine is as effective as treatment with amlodipine, has a better tolerability profile, and results in greater improvement in quality of life than amlodipine.",0,0

However, there is uncertainty about the efficacy and safety of blood pressure lowering treatments for many such patients. Perindopril protection against recurrent stroke trial (PROGRESS) was designed to determine the effects of a blood pressure lowering regimen in hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack; 6105 subjects from 172 centers in Asia, Australasia, and Europe were randomly assigned either active therapy (n=3051) or placebo (n=3054). Active therapy consisted of a flexible regimen based on the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (4 mg daily) with the addition of the diuretic indapamide at the discretion of treating physicians. The primary outcome was total paralysis (fatal or non-fatal). The analysis was therapeutic; Over 4 years of follow-up, active therapy lowered blood pressure by 9/4 mm Hg. 307 (10%) subjects given active therapy had a stroke, compared with 420 (14%) given placebo (28% relative risk reduction [95% CI 17-38], p<0.0001). Active treatment also reduced the overall risk of major vascular events (26% [16–34]). There were similar reductions in stroke risk in the hypertensive and non-hypertensive subgroups (all p<0.01). Combination therapy with perindopril plus indapamide reduced blood pressure by 12/5 mm Hg and the risk of stroke by 43% (30–54). Single-drug therapy reduced blood pressure by 5/3 mm Hg and produced no discernible reduction in stroke risk; This blood pressure lowering regimen reduced the risk of stroke in both hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Combination therapy with perindopril and indapamide produced greater blood pressure reductions and greater risk reductions than single drug therapy with perindopril alone. Treatment with these two agents should be routinely considered in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, regardless of blood pressure.",0,0

The objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate the effects of losartan on serum uric acid in hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia and gout, (2) to compare the effects of losartan with another angiotensin II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, and (3) with losartan 50 mg once daily in serum to assess whether there is a greater effect of losartan 50 mg once daily on uric acid levels; Thirteen hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia and gout completed this prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Uric acid-lowering drugs were stopped 3 weeks before the start of the study. Patients were randomized to receive losartan 50 mg or irbesartan 150 mg once daily for 4 weeks. At this stage, a placebo was given in the evening. After 4 weeks the dose was increased to losartan 50 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily for another 4-week period. Afterwards, the patients were switched to an alternative treatment method. Enalapril (20 mg od) was given during the acclimatization period and between the two treatment phases. Serum and urinary uric acid were measured at the beginning and end of each treatment phase; Our results show that losartan 50 mg once daily reduces serum uric acid levels from 538 +/- 26 to 491 +/-20 micromol/l (P < 0.01). Irbesartan had no effect on serum uric acid. Increasing the losartan dose from 50 mg to 50 mg twice daily did not further lower serum uric acid. This may be due in part to poor adherence to the evening dose measured with an electronic device. In fact, the average adherence of the evening dose was always significantly lower than the morning dose, regardless of the drug prescribed. The uricosuric effect of losartan appears to decrease over time as a new steady state of low serum uric acid is reached. Unlike irbesartan, losartan is uricosuric and lowers serum uric acid levels. Losartan 50 mg bid did not produce a greater reduction in serum uric acid than losartan once daily. Losartan may be a useful therapeutic tool for controlling blood pressure and lowering serum uric acid levels in hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia and gout.",0,0

Patients who meet the criteria for inclusion in the HOPE trial should be considered suitable candidates for long-term ramipril therapy in addition to their current drug regimen. Screening should include checking of renal function (with serum creatinine), particularly during the first two weeks of treatment, in addition to regular monitoring of serum potassium. However, the HOPE study shows that ramipril is well tolerated at high doses and over a long treatment period.

Therapeutic trials based on cardiovascular mortality have recently shown that SBP reduction requires normalization of both large artery stiffness and wave reflections. The aim of this study was to compare the antihypertensive effects of a very low dose combination of indapamide (0.625 mg) and perindopril (2 mg) (Per/Ind) with the beta-blocking agent atenolol (50 mg). Per/Ind lowers SBP and pulse pressure (PP) more than atenolol, and if so, this reduction is predominantly due to reduction of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) (automatic measurements) and reduction of wave reflections (pulse wave analysis, applanation tonometry). In a double-blind randomized study, 471 patients with essential hypertension were followed for 12 months. For the same DBP decrease, Per/Ind significantly increased brachial SBP (-6.02 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -8.90 to -3.14) and PP (-5.57; 95% confidence interval, -7.70 to -3.44). reduced atenolol. This difference was significantly more pronounced for the carotid artery than for the brachial artery. While the 2 antihypertensive agents reduced PWV to a similar degree, only Per/Ind significantly reduced carotid wave reflections and caused a selective reduction in SBP and PP.

Preliminary evidence suggests that a decrease in blood pressure (BP) is associated with decreased wall thickness. It is unknown whether all classes of antihypertensive agents have similar protective effects. In this double-blind parallel group clinical study, 69 patients with previously untreated hypertension were randomly assigned to 1 year of treatment with amlodipine (5-10 mg daily) or lisinopril (5-20 mg daily). Doxazosin and bendrofluazide were added if necessary to maintain BP control. After 12 months of treatment, clinical BP, ambulatory BP, and cardiac mass were similarly reduced by the two treatment regimens. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness was reduced by 0.048 mm (95% confidence interval -0.066, -0.031 mm) in the amlodipine-treated group, but only 0.027 mm (-0.046, -0.007 mm) in the lisinopril-treated group (Differential treatment). for P<0.05). Common carotid artery lumen diameter only with lisinopril [amlodipine, -0.02 mm (-0.14, 0.10 mm); lisinopril, -0.21 mm (-0.32, -0.11 mm); P<0.02], while the intima-media area decreased similarly in the two treatment groups [amlodipine -1.32 mm(2) (-1.91, -0.74 mm(2)), lisinopril -1.26 mm(2) (-1.80, -0.72 mm( 2nd)); no problem]. The results confirm that a decrease in blood pressure causes regression of structural changes in the carotid artery in hypertensive patients. Despite similar reductions in BP, the nature of the structural regression differed markedly between the two treatment regimens. Calcium channel blocker caused more regression in common carotid artery intima-media thickness than angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. However, carotid artery wall mass, as indicated by the intima-media area, was reduced to a similar extent with the two treatments. Whether such differences confer a prognostic advantage remains to be determined.",0,0

The contribution of adverse drug reactions and nonadherence to medical emergency admission was analyzed.; A total of 578 consecutive elderly patients presenting to the medical emergency department were interviewed to determine the percentage of admissions due to adverse drug reactions or non-compliance with drug regimens, their causes, outcomes, and predictors. Of the 578 referrals, 83 (14.4%) were drug-related: 39 (6.7%) from adverse drug reactions and 44 (7.6%) from non-adherence. One hundred and ninety-two (33.2%) patients had a history of non-compliance. Factors associated with an increased risk of admission due to an adverse drug reaction were patients with diabetes or neoplasms and patients using multiple different medications. Factors associated with higher risk of hospitalization due to non-compliance, poor recall of medication regimen, multiple visits to physicians, female gender, multiple pharmacies, medication costs, and transition to non-traditional forms of treatment; Many older admissions are drug related, with non-compliance making up a significant portion of them.

Mild to moderate essential hypertension treated with an angiotensin II antagonist (valsartan, 80 mg/day) for 4 weeks but with diastolic blood pressure (BP) > 90 mmHg when given alone; A total of 327 patients were included in the study, and after 4 weeks of valsartan monotherapy, 153 patients (46%) had diastolic BP </= 90 mmHg. These patients continued the same treatment regimen for the next 4 weeks, but no further blood pressure reduction was observed. The remaining patients were randomized to either the valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide or the valsartan-benazepril combination; The two combinations resulted in an additional significant BP reduction of similar magnitude for diastolic BP (-4.5 during valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide therapy and -3.3 mmHg during valsartan-benazepril therapy), but greater for systolic BP during valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide (- 6 77 mmHg) during co-administration with valsartan-benazepril (-3.2 mmHg). At the end of the trial, those who responded to valsartan monotherapy had lower blood pressure than patients who needed combination therapy. Valsartan given alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide or benazepril was well tolerated; These data therefore suggest that in patients who are not adequately responsive to angiotensin II receptor blockade, BP can be further and safely lowered by adding a small dose of a diuretic or an ACE inhibitor, where the diuretic-containing combination tends to be more effective in controlling systolic BP. .",0,0

We aimed to investigate whether the pharmacological properties of antihypertensive drugs or reduction in systolic pressure explain the cardiovascular outcome in hypertensive or high-risk patients; In a meta-analysis, we extracted summary statistics from published reports and calculated pooled odds ratios for experimental and reference treatment. We correlated inter-trial odd ratios for systolic pressure differences between groups; We analyzed nine randomized trials comparing treatments in 62605 hypertensive patients. Compared with older drugs (diuretics and β-blockers), calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors provided similar overall cardiovascular protection, but calcium channel blockers provided greater reductions in stroke risk (13.5%, 95% CI 1.3-) 24.2, p=0.03 ) and less reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction (19.2%, 3.5-37.3, p=0.01). Heterogeneity between trials was significant, due to a high risk of cardiovascular events on doxazosin in one trial and a high risk of stroke on captopril in the other; however, systolic pressure differed by 2-3 mm Hg between the groups in these two trials. Similar systolic differences occurred in the older drug versus diltiazem trial and in the three trials of the converting enzyme inhibitor versus placebo in high-risk patients. Meta-regression across 27 studies (136124 patients) showed that odds ratios could be explained by differences in systolic pressure; Our findings highlight the importance of blood pressure control. All antihypertensive drugs have similar long-term efficacy and safety. Calcium channel blockers can be particularly effective in preventing stroke.

They increase the availability of peptides with vasodilator and other vascular effects; they also inhibit the production of angiotensin II. In animal models, vasopeptidase inhibitors appear to reduce blood pressure in low, intermediate, and high renin forms of hypertension and also appear to provide benefits in models of heart failure and ischemic heart disease. Studies in human hypertension show that these agents are effective in lowering blood pressure regardless of race or age. Experience with omapatrilat, the most clinically advanced of these drugs, has shown that it is more effective than currently available ACE inhibitors or other commonly used antihypertensive agents. Studies with omapatrilat in congestive heart failure have shown beneficial effects on hemodynamics and symptoms. Vasopeptidase inhibitors appear to have similar safety profiles to ACE inhibitors, but the frequency of side effects such as angioedema and cough has not yet been determined. Large trials with clinical endpoints are needed to locate this class of drugs in conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and nephropathy.",0,0

It seems paradoxical that such renoprotective effects are clearly evident in diabetes mellitus where plasma renin activity may be suppressed. Even in this setting, there is activation of the renal angiotensin system(s) and inhibition of these intrarenal systems These agents appear to be involved in the renoprotective effects.Recent studies have identified nearly all of the components required to generate angiotensin II in the renal lumen compartment and include AT(1) receptors. suggesting that there may be a direct effect on NaCl transport in the distal nephron. The possibility that components of this intraluminal renin-angiotensin system may be acutely regulated by changes in dietary salt intake provides an opportunity to better understand the normal maintenance of salt balance. Whether inhibition of these pathways is involved in the renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists is an important issue to be addressed.",0,0

This suggests that lowering blood pressure is responsible for improving compliance. In conclusion, it has been suggested that atenolol induces hemodynamic changes mediated only by a reduction in blood pressure. Conversely, the enhanced brachial cushioning function observed after ramipril includes not only hemodynamic changes but also changes mediated by other mechanisms, such as modification of wall structures.",0,0

A planned subanalysis of CAPPP was to evaluate outcome in the diabetic patient group; In the CAPPP, 572 (4.9% of 10,985 hypertensive patients) had diabetes at baseline and were studied according to a prospective, randomized, open, blind, end-point trial design. Patients aged 25-66 years with diastolic blood pressure > or = 100 mmHg were included and randomized to receive captopril or conventional antihypertensive therapy (diuretics and/or beta-blockers); The primary endpoint, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke, and other cardiovascular deaths were significantly lower in captopril than in the conventional treatment group (relative risk [RR] = 0.59; P = 0.018). Specifically, cardiovascular mortality, defined as fatal stroke and myocardial infarction, sudden death, and other cardiovascular deaths, tended to be lower in the captopril group (RR = 0.48; P = 0.084), and no differences were observed between study groups for stroke. (RR = 1.02; P = 0.96). Myocardial infarctions were less frequent in the captopril group than in the conventional treatment group (RR = 0.34; P = 0.002). In addition, overall mortality was lower with captopril compared with the conventional treatment group (RR = 0.54; P = 0.034).

821,11723356,Beyond the usual strategies for lowering blood pressure: therapeutic considerations and combination therapies.,,"Giles, T D; Sander, G E","Rapidly accumulating clinical data have not only repeatedly demonstrated the critical importance of even small increases in blood pressure as a pathophysiological factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, particularly in individuals with diabetes, but also demonstrated the therapeutic necessity of more aggressive blood pressure lowering. achieving progressively lower blood pressure targets in reducing cardiovascular event rates. JNC VI defined optimal blood pressure as <or=120/80 mm Hg and Stage 1 hypertension as >or=140/80 mmHg. Target blood pressures are now <or=130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes and <125/75 mmHg in patients with hypertensive kidney disease with proteinuria >1 gm/24 hours. Achieving such target pressures is becoming increasingly difficult, especially in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease who need complex multidrug antihypertensive regimens. This review attempts to offer some recommendations for the establishment of such antihypertensive regimens and provides considerations for the appropriate use of diuretics and the most effective drug combinations. Potentially contributing factors to drug-resistant hypertension include issues such as inability to maximize drug dose, suboptimal use of diuretics, incompatibility, and possible confounding effects of such concomitant medications, such as nonsteroidal and anti-inflammatory drugs or decongestants. The underlying issues of drug-resistant hypertension are listed, along with strategies to tackle this issue.",0,0

As combinations, sulfonylureas plus metformin were most popular, followed by metformin plus insulin and sulfonylureas plus insulin. Sulfonylurea and insulin and metformin have been used infrequently. There was no significant difference in prescribing glyburide and metformin between elderly and young middle-aged diabetic patients; Many patients older than 65 years have been treated with a long-acting sulfonylurea in combination with a beta-blocker. Beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers were most commonly prescribed, both as monotherapy and in general use. Various two- and three-drug combinations of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics were frequently used in 35.5% of patients treated with antihypertensive combinations. The proportion of patients receiving 100 mg/day atenolol was higher in the combination regimens.

Hypertensive menopausal women have not received optimal treatment. They have a worse prognosis than men of the same age. Therefore, antihypertensive treatments deserve special attention. Hormone replacement, aspirin prophylaxis and lipid-lowering drugs have their place.

ASA may antagonize some effects of ACEi therapy by inhibiting the synthesis of vasodilator prostaglandins; however, evidence for this effect from large controlled trials is conflicting. The authors analyzed a database of 18,895 patients in the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravivenza nell'Infarto Miocardio-3 (GISSI-3) Study, in which patients were assigned to receive or not receive lisinopril within 24 hours of disease onset. myocardial infarction symptoms. The aim of the study was to confirm the possible negative interaction between ASA and ACEi lisinopril in the postacute phase of acute myocardial infarction. Of the 18,895 analyzable patients, 15,841 received ASA at admission. Overall, lisinopril reduced the 42-day mortality from 7.1% to 6.3%. Mortality was reduced from 6.0% to 5.4% with lisinopril in patients receiving ASA, and from 13.0% to 10.8% in patients not receiving ASA. The difference in proportional reduction in mortality corresponds to the fact that a more pronounced effect of lisinopril was seen in patients at higher baseline risk in all study subgroups, one of which overlapped with the ASA-free group. Analysis of the in-hospital incidence of major clinical events did not reveal a potentially negative interaction between ASA and lisinopril. The same findings were obtained from the reinfarction analysis at day 42. The interaction between ASA and lisinopril was also tested with multivariate analysis adjusted for confounding variables at entry, and the interaction tests were not statistically significant. On day 42, serum creatinine levels were significantly higher in the lisinopril group than in the control group. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the lisinopril group were significantly lower at day 42 compared to the controls. The effect of lisinopril on creatinine and blood pressure did not differ between the ASA and non-ASA groups. ASA does not reduce the mortality benefit of early lisinopril after myocardial infarction, nor does it increase the risk of major adverse events. Lisinopril is safe and effective when given early after the onset of myocardial infarction, regardless of whether ASA co-administration is initiated early and continued over a 6-week period.",0,0

The purpose of the ABC Trial was to address previous reports suggesting that drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may not be effective in controlling BP in hypertensive black individuals. Patients were randomized to receive candesartan cilexetil 16 mg (n = 156) or placebo (n = 148) once daily after a 4 to 5 week single-blind, placebo acclimatization period. Doses of candesartan cilexetil and placebo were doubled if the DBP settling trough (24 +/- 3 hours post-dose) was 90 mmHg or greater after 4 weeks. If DBP was 90 mmHg or higher at week 8, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg was added to both placebo and 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan cilexetil reduces sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP at week 8 (1.3/2.7 mmHg vs. 6.4/5.1 mmHg) and week 12 (9.3/7.5 mmHg vs. 5.7/5.2 mmHg). was significantly more effective than placebo. Hydrochlorothiazide was added to 27% and 50% of patients in the candesartan cilexetil and placebo groups, respectively. Control and responder rates were consistently higher at 8 and 12 weeks in the candesartan cilexetil treatment group. Discontinuation and adverse event rates were similar in the two groups.

This can be assessed informally through traditional patient interviews or more formally through the use of validated health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures that assess the patient's perception of the tolerability of the agent. HRQL was the secondary endpoint of a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and tolerability of candesartan cilexetil in black patients with systemic hypertension. HRQL was assessed using the generic Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) and the population- and condition-specific Vital Signs Life Signs Questionnaire (VSQLQ). Data were collected through face-to-face interviews at screening, baseline, and at weeks 8 and 12. Of the 304 randomized patients, 268 could be evaluated for HRQL analysis. The clinical outcomes reported in the accompanying article were that candesartan cilexetil initiated at 16 mg once daily and titrated to 32 mg once daily followed by the addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide as needed was effective in lowering diastolic and systolic blood pressure and was well tolerated based on office interviews. . Analyzes of patients' perceptions of tolerability found that HRQL was maintained over the 12-week study period, with no significant difference between the treatment and placebo groups at the end of double-blind treatment. These results demonstrate that the HRQL of black patients with systemic hypertension is maintained during treatment with candesartan cilexetil.",0,0

Efficacy of Ramipril in Nephropathy.,,"Ruggenenti, P; Perna, A; Remuzzi, G","secondary analysis of this post hoc, Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) study evaluated a risk/benefit profile of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in 322 patients with non-diabetic, proteinuric chronic nephropathy and varying degrees of renal impairment. The rate of GFR decline (Delta GFR) and the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during treatment with ramipril or no ACE inhibitor were compared in three tertiles of baseline GFR. Delta GFR was comparable in the three tertiles, while the incidence of ESRD was higher in the lowest tertile than in the middle and highest tertile. Ramipril reduced Delta GFR by 22%, 22%, and 35% in the lowest, medium, and highest tertiles, respectively, and the incidence of ESRD by 33% (P < 0.05), 37%, and 100% (P < 0.01). . Delta GFR reduction was predicted by baseline systolic (P < 0.0001), diastolic (P = 0.02) and mean (P < 0.001) BP and proteinuria (P < 0.0001), but not by baseline GFR (P = 0.12). ESRD risk reduction was predicted by baseline proteinuria (P < 0.01) and GFR (P < 0.0001) and was strongly dependent on treatment duration (P < 0.0001). Adverse events were comparable between the three tertiles and within each tertile in the two treatment groups. Therefore, disease progression and response to ACE inhibition are not dependent on the severity of renal impairment. The risk of ESRD and the absolute number of events saved by ACE inhibition are highest in patients with the lowest GFR. However, renoprotection is maximized when ACE inhibition is initiated earlier and long-term treatment can result in stabilization of GFR and definitive prevention of ESRD.",0,0

One hundred and fifty-four patients (nifedipine=78, lisinopril=76) with untreated hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > or =95 mmHg) were randomized within 3 weeks after kidney transplant. One hundred and twenty-three patients (nifedipine=69, lisinopril=54) completed the study. Fourteen (20%) recipients treated with nifedipine responded at the early stage and 26 (38%) at the post-operative stage (4-12 months after kidney transplantation). Eleven (20%) lisinopril-treated recipients responded early, and 18 (33%) patients responded late post-transplant.

However, the role of shear stress, the relationship between endothelial dysfunction and mechanics, and the effect of chronic ACE inhibition on this relationship have not been investigated. This study was designed to evaluate the relationship between flow-induced dilation and radial artery mechanics at known shear stress levels in heart failure patients and to evaluate the effect of chronic ACE inhibition. Sixteen stable congestive heart failure patients who had not been previously treated with ACE inhibitors participated in the study. Arterial pressure, cardiac output (bioimpedance), radial artery diameter (echo monitoring) and flow (Doppler), total blood viscosity, and mean arterial wall shear stress were assessed before and during a gradual increase in forearm blood flow in response to gradual distal blood flow. hand skin warming. Cross-sectional radial artery compliance and resilience indices were calculated at 34°C, 40°C and 44°C. Endothelium-independent vasodilation was assessed using glyceryl trinitrate.

There was no difference between the 2 groups in all parameters before treatment. After chronic ACE inhibition, systolic arterial pressure decreased from 126+/-11 initially to 118+/-10 mm Hg (P<0.05). During warming, the increase in diameter in response to shear stress was greater after ACE inhibition than after placebo (time/treatment interaction, P<0.05).

This study demonstrates that chronic administration of the ACE inhibitor perindopril increases the magnitude of flow-induced dilatation and restores the flow-induced increase in radial artery compliance and elasticity assessed at stable shear stress.

838,11752035,Contribution of volume overload and angiotensin II to increased pulse wave velocity of hemodialysis patients.,,"Tycho Vuurmans, J L; Boer, Walther H; Bos, Willem-Jan W; Blankestijn, Peter J; Koomans, Hein A","Aortic compliance is reduced in patients with end-stage renal disease. This dysfunction contributes to high aortic systolic pressures and thus to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. In addition to structural vascular changes, functional changes resulting from hypervolemia and increased vasoconstrictor activity, especially angiotensin II, have been hypothesized to play a role in the reduction of aortic compliance. Nineteen hemodialysis patients were studied before and 24 hours after dialysis to dry weight. Applanation tonometry of peripheral arteries was used to estimate aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), which is known to be dependent on aortic compliance and aortic systolic pressure increase (magnification index [Aix]). Pre-dialysis aortic PWV was increased in dialysis patients compared to matched healthy volunteers (9.9 +/- 3.1 vs 7.5 +/- 1.1 m/s; P < 0.05). AIx also increased (35 +/- 6 vs 25 +/- 10; P < 0.05). Volume reduction by dialysis had no significant effect on PWV (9.3 +/- 1.5 m/s), but AIx decreased (28 +/- 7; P < 0.05). A subgroup of 10 patients was re-studied after 1 week of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi) with enalapril 5 mg once daily. ACEi reduced both pre-dialysis blood pressure and post-dialysis blood pressure, but had no effect on pulse pressure and heart rate, which remained elevated compared with healthy subjects. ACEi also reduced predialysis aortic PWV from 11.0 +/- 3.5 to 9.1 +/- 2.1 m/s (P < 0.05), but had no significant effect on AIx. During treatment with ACEi, the same volume reduction as dialysis further reduced the aortic PWV to 8.0 +/- 1.4 m/s (P < 0.05); this figure was not different from PWV in healthy subjects. AIx even fell slightly below normal (12 +/- 23; P < 0.05). It was concluded that both volume overload and angiotensin II contribute to elevated PWV and AIx in dialysis patients.

842,11759959,Evaluation of the efficacy of perindopril on arterial elasticity in mild to moderate hypertension.,,,"Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) have been clearly proven to be effective in blood pressure control and hemodynamic control in heart failure patients. There is also evidence in both animal models and humans that ACEIs have the ability to reduce cardiovascular remodeling. Therefore, a decrease in arterial stiffness formation is also expected, which leads to an increase in resilience; Apart from physically measuring the arterial wall, the Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) assessment is a widely used index of arterial elasticity that degrades during remodeling. A 6-month multicenter study was conducted in 146 patients with mild to moderate hypertension to determine the efficacy of the specific ACEI, perindopril, in increasing arterial elasticity and thus reducing PWV. The study population consisted of 70 men and 76 women aged 56.36 years (SD 9.4, range 28-73). 73 patients were newly diagnosed, 65 patients were treated but their blood pressure was not controlled and 8 patients had their blood pressure controlled but treated with side effects that needed to change their treatment regimen. Mean blood pressure at study start was 164.25/97.49 mmHg and 11.71 m/s (SD 2.29 range 7.35-20.12 m/s) at mean PWV.

The prevalence is as high as 58% in women aged 65 to 74 years. Approximately 40% of stroke cases, 39% of myocardial infarction cases and 28% of end-stage renal disease can be attributed to hypertension. Despite the burden of hypertension on women, the effect of antihypertensive therapy on cardiovascular complications has not been fully established. To fill this knowledge gap, two meta-analyses with gender-specific results were reviewed, which included the most recent randomized, controlled trials to evaluate the treatment of hypertension. The Individual Data Analysis of the antihypertensive (INDANA) intervention trials group and Quan et al. analyzed treatment benefits in 23,000 women and 19,975 men based on subgroup meta-analyses of 12 randomized, controlled trials comparing antihypertensive drug therapy with placebo. Meta-analyses showed a statistically significant treatment benefit for all reported clinical outcomes in men of all ages and black women. In women over 54 years of age, antihypertensive therapy has been associated with a significant reduction in fatal and non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Overall, there was no significant difference in the relative treatment benefit in men and women; however, the absolute treatment benefit was lower in women than in men. Thus, the number of patients required to be treated for the endpoints of fatal stroke, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular events was one to three times higher for women than for men. Also, white women between the ages of 30 and 54 did not benefit or harm from the treatment. Data from the 6.7 years of follow-up in the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program (HDFP) study suggested that this group of younger women may benefit from a longer course of treatment. Indications for pharmacological intervention seem fairly clear for all subgroups except these young women. Until more evidence is found for this low-risk subgroup, current recommendations for lifestyle change cannot be contested.",0,0

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced intestinal angioedema (AIAI) occurs in very few patients receiving ACE inhibitors. The clinical presentation includes symptoms of acute abdomen, marked intestinal edema, and ascites with occasional facial and/or oropharyngeal swelling. AIAI is diagnosed based on the temporal relationship between symptomatic presentation and drug use, the absence of alternative diagnoses, including other causes of angioedema, and rapid resolution of symptoms upon discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor. Rapid radiological examination (computed abdominal tomography and/or ultrasound) is critical for early diagnosis and preventing unnecessary surgical intervention. There is female predominance of AIAI, which may reflect the interaction of estradiol with various pathways involved in AIAI pathophysiology. Management of AIAI consists mainly of conservative measures and discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be considered as suitable alternatives. Awareness and knowledge of AIAI is important because of the increasing use of ACE inhibitors, the current delays in diagnosis, clear management strategies after diagnosis, and the futility of alternative diagnoses that can lead to significant morbidity. AIAI should be considered in patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop gastrointestinal complaints, regardless of duration of treatment.",0,0

864,11790173,Scleroderma treatment.,,"Sapadin, Allen N; Fleischmajer, Raul","Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) is difficult to treat and remains a major challenge for the clinician. Because the cause is unknown, treatments are aimed at improving peripheral blood circulation with vasodilators and antiplatelet aggregation drugs, preventing synthesis and release of harmful cytokines with immunosuppressant drugs, and inhibiting or reducing fibrosis with agents that reduce collagen synthesis or increase collagenase production. . The purpose of this review is to critically analyze traditional and new treatments for systemic sclerosis and localized scleroderma. Therapeutic options discussed for the treatment of systemic sclerosis include (1) the use of vasodilators (calcium channel blockers [nifedipine], angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [captopril, losartan potassium] and prostaglandins [iloprost, epoprostenol]), (2). immunosuppressant drugs (methotrexate, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide and extracorporeal photopheresis) and (3) antifibrotic agents (D-penicillamine, colchicine, interferon gamma and relaxant). Reviewed treatment options for localized scleroderma include the use of corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues (calcitriol, calcipotriene), UV-A, and methotrexate. Preliminary reports on new treatments for systemic sclerosis are also being considered. These include the use of minocycline, psoralen-UV-A, lung transplantation, autologous stem cell transplantation, etanercept and thalidomide.",0,0

866,11790925,Management of heart failure in the elderly.,,"Rich, Michael W","The management of chronic heart failure in elderly patients is often complicated by multiple comorbid conditions, polypharmacy, psychosocial and financial concerns, and difficulties in compliance with complex medication and dietary regimens. In addition, a small number of patients over 80 years of age were included in clinical trials, so the effectiveness of current heart failure treatments remains unclear in this age group. Taken together, these factors contribute to the persistently high rates of hospitalization and death in the elderly, as well as the poor quality of life associated with chronic heart failure. This article reviews the non-pharmacological care and pharmacotherapy aspects of systolic heart failure in elderly patients. Optimal management requires a systematic approach consisting of 5 key elements: coordination of care across disciplines, patient and caregiver education, development of self-management skills, effective follow-up, and rational use of drugs. However, it must be recognized that the prognosis of established heart failure remains poor, even with ""best practice"" interventions. Therefore, future research should be directed towards developing more effective strategies for the prevention of heart failure in our aging population.",0,0

In phase 1, 40 hypertensives were randomly assigned to either the losartan (50 mg) group or the quinapril (10 mg) group. In phase 2, 65 hypertensives were randomized after 3 months with 10 mg quinapril monotherapy, 50 mg losartan (n = 32) or 5 mg amlodipine (n = 33) added to quinapril and treated for an additional 3 months. .

The aim of this study was to compare the hemodynamic changes and tolerability of perindopril and captopril after AMI. We randomized 212 patients to receive captopril (n = 102) or perindopril (n = 110) within 72 hours of AMI. Captopril was given as an initial dose of 6.25 mg, followed by 50 mg/day on day 1 and then 100 mg/day. The corresponding perindopril doses were 2, 4 and 8 mg/day. Acute hemodynamic changes, percentage of patients reaching target dose, in-hospital and 6-month cardiovascular events were monitored.

The diagnosis of IMN was made by exclusion of secondary forms of membranous nephropathy by extensive clinical and pathological studies. No patients were given steroids or cytotoxic agents six months before enrollment. In the CSA group, CSA was given at an initial dose of 5 mg.kg-1.d-1, gradually decreased in the first three months and maintained at 2 mg.kg-1.d-1 for 12 months. In the CAP group, TKP at a dose of 37.5 mg/day; In the first three months, 6 (6/15) complete remission (CR) and 2 (2/15) partial remission (PR) were observed in the CSA group, while only 2 (2/15) PRs were observed in the CSA group. . Before the end of 15 months, 8 patients in the CSA group experienced CR and 4 patients experienced PR. One CR patient relapsed because the CSA dose was reduced, so 7 patients remained in CR after the first 15 months. No additional CR or PR was observed in the CAP group at late follow-up. At the last visit in the CSA group (mean follow-up of 44 months), 2 more CR patients relapsed and 1 CR patient switched to PR after discontinuing CSA therapy, so the 4 CR and 5 PR patients remained in the CSA group. In the CAP group, 3 spontaneous CRs occurred beyond the 1.5-year follow-up with 3 CRs and 2 PRs at the last visit. There was no difference between the mean of baseline and final serum creatinine levels in both groups. No serious side effects were found during CSA treatment. Re-biopsy data of three patients who responded to CSA therapy showed that no pathological improvement of the glomerular basement membrane was observed, even in cases in remission. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis was found in 1 patient with recurrent CR with serum creatinine above the normal range, but not in the other 2 patients with serum creatinine within the normal range; CSA treatment at a dose of 5 mg.kg-1.d-1 is effective in inducing remission of nephrotic syndrome within three months in adult IMN patients, with a response rate of 80%.

There is now a wealth of documentation on the beneficial effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) on mortality and morbidity in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Such documentation is still lacking for angiotensin II receptor antagonists sold in Denmark in 1999 for 77% of the amount spent on ACE inhibitors. This review evaluates the therapeutic effects of angiotensin II antagonists compared to ACE inhibitors in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. From 21 comparative studies lasting up to one year, it can be concluded that blood pressure reduction with the two classes is similar. Both showed relatively few side effects, the only difference being a higher incidence of cough after ACE inhibitors. Until larger comparative long-term studies on mortality and morbidity are conducted, angiotensin II antagonists should only be used in hypertensive patients who experience unacceptable side effects with ACE inhibitors.",0,0
871,11794428,review of vasopeptidase inhibitors: a new modality in the treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure.,,"Nathisuwan, Surakit; Talbert, Robert L","Vasopeptidase inhibitors are a group of agents that can inhibit neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzymes, leading to potentiation of natriuretic peptide actions and suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. With this distinctive characteristic mechanism, these agents have emerged as a new class of drugs for the management of hypertension and heart failure. Several vasopeptidase inhibitors are under clinical investigation. Omapatrilat is the most studied agent in this class. Clinical studies of Omapatrilat in hypertension have consistently demonstrated the efficacy of the agent in various patient populations. In patients with heart failure, omapatrilat significantly improved the neurohormonal and hemodynamic status. The long-term effects of omapatrilate in patients with recent heart failure were compared with the effects of conventional therapy in a large phase II study. The results of the study look promising. Large clinical trials are underway, and additional safety and efficacy information from these studies may help determine this agent's place in therapy.",0,0

873,11805530,Effects of alcohol on the heart.,,"Spies, C D; Sander, M; Stangl, K; Fernandez-Sola, J; Preedy, V R; Rubin, E; Andreasson, S; Hanna, E Z; Kox, W J","Some evidence suggests that light to moderate alcohol consumption protects against cardiovascular disease. However, this cardioprotective effect of alcohol consumption in adults is absent at the population level. Approximately 20-30% of patients admitted to the hospital are alcohol dependent. In medical practice, it is essential to know the consumption levels of patients because of the many negative effects that may result in the routine care process. Ethanol damage to the heart is evident if alcohol consumption exceeds 90 to 100 g/d. Heavy ethanol consumption is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death and cardiac arrhythmias. In patients with coronary heart disease, alcohol use was associated with increased mortality. An early response to drinking was an increased ventricular wall thickness to diameter ratio, possibly progressing with alcoholic cardiomyopathy with continued drinking; this had a worse outcome compared with idiopathic dilative cardiomyopathy when drinking was not stopped or at least not reduced (<60 g/day). . In the intensive care unit, patients with chronic alcoholism are more likely to have postoperative cardiac complications. These complications are probably caused by biventricular dysfunction, which is three to four times more common among chronic alcoholics than occasional or non-drinkers, especially with the occurrence of severe infections or septic shock. To prevent further complications from alcohol use and to manage long-term drinking, patients with alcohol abuse and heart failure should be treated in short intervention and follow-up programs. If complete abstinence is achieved, the prognosis is good even for patients with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure caused by cardiomyopathy. Non-compliance with modifiable smoking and alcohol restrictions significantly increases the risk of hospital readmission in patients with heart failure.",0,0

After 4 weeks of placebo washout, patients underwent 4 weeks of cross-treatment. After treatment with placebo, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 143+/-2 and 86+/-1 mm Hg and plasma PAI-1 was 43.4+/-2.3 ng/mL. Amlodipine produced greater systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions than fosinopril (10 mm Hg vs. 8 mm Hg, P=0.029 and 5 mm Hg vs. 3 mm Hg, P=0.040), but while tending to increase PAI-1 , fosinopril tended to decrease PAI-1 (5.4+/-3.6 vs -3.8+/-2.5 ng/mL, P=0.045).

875,11817974,Treatment of heart failure in patients with diabetes mellitus.,,"Lavine, Steven J; Gellman, Steven D","Patients with diabetes mellitus have increased morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease. Both coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure (CHF) are largely responsible for the increased incidence of cardiovascular adverse events in patients with diabetes. This review discusses the pathophysiology of CHF, the mechanisms of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and the neurohormonal mechanisms involved in both LV dysfunction and CHF. Diabetes with and without hypertension is an important cause of LV dysfunction and CHF. While diabetes may be responsible for the metabolic and ultrastructural causes of LV dysfunction, hypertension may be responsible for the marked fibrotic changes found. Experimental induction of diabetes in animals has shed light on the biochemical and ultrastructural changes seen. The role of insulin in reversing both metabolic and structural changes has been reviewed from both experimental data and the limited amount of clinical data available. Treatment of CHF in patients with diabetes is similar to treatment of patients without diabetes with treatment for the use of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Because patients with diabetes have higher morbidity and mortality, many studies have highlighted the importance of this subgroup, where there is an opportunity to have a significant clinical impact. An important opportunity exists to reduce morbidity and mortality with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors when both ischemia and CHF are present. However, studies in diabetes patients have been limited to post hoc subgroup analyzes and rarely to predefined subgroups. There is clearly a need for future clinical trials involving patients with diabetes and LV dysfunction, with and without hypertension, to adequately address the needs of this high-risk subgroup.",0,0
876,11817979,Quinapril: Further update of its pharmacology and therapeutic use in cardiovascular disorders.,,"Culy, Christine R; Jarvis, Blair","Quinapril is rapidly deesterified after absorption into quinapril (active diacid metabolite), a potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Quinapril produces favorable hemodynamic changes and improves ventricular and endothelial function in patients with various cardiovascular disorders; these effects are mediated by the binding of quinapril to both tissue and plasma ACE. Quinapril 10 to 40 mg/day provided effective blood pressure control in most patients with essential hypertension in clinical studies, although some patients required 80 mg daily and/or concomitant diuretic therapy. Overall, quinapril achieved blood pressure control similar to other standard antihypertensive therapies, including other ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in comparative clinical trials. In two well-designed studies, combined treatment with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide had a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either drug used as monotherapy. Quinapril has also been shown to reduce microalbuminuria in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus. In patients with congestive heart failure, quinapril <or=40 mg/day produced beneficial hemodynamic and echocardiographic changes and improved exercise tolerance, symptoms, and functional class. The effects of quinapril on survival have not been studied, but in two well-designed studies, 10 to 20 mg of quinapril daily showed comparable efficacy to 25 to 50 mg of captopril twice daily. In a well-controlled study (n = 148) in patients with coronary artery disease, quinapril 40 mg/day significantly reduced the incidence of ischemic events after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, in a similarly designed study involving 1750 patients undergoing coronary angioplasty, a lower dose of quinapril (20 mg/day) had no effect on ischemic events or atherosclerotic progression with 3 years of treatment. The tolerability of quinapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. In placebo-controlled studies, cough occurred in 2% and 4.3% of quinapril recipients with hypertension or congestive heart failure, and hypotension in <1 and 2.9%, respectively. No increase in adverse events was observed when the dose was increased from 10 mg/day to 40 mg/day; Quinapril is now firmly established as an effective and well tolerated ACE inhibitor for the treatment of patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. Quinapril 40 mg/day also significantly reduced the incidence of ischemic events in patients undergoing CABG in one study; however, a lower dose of quinapril (20 mg/day) had no effect on ischemic events in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty in another study. Additional trials would be beneficial in patients with coronary artery disease receiving the optimal dose of quinapril (40 mg/day).",0,0

In all analysis years after the first, costs and QALYs were higher for the benazepril arm than for the placebo arm. Sensitivity analyzes of changes in key model parameters found sequential stability of results in favor of the benazepril treatment arm. While it may be appropriate to reflect treatment practice differences in the US relative to European countries, if the underlying dialysis and transplantation model rates are increased, additional economic and health benefits will be seen in favor of patients receiving benazepril; Treatment with benazepril as a component of antihypertensive therapy for people with chronic renal failure is initially costly, but the investment costs are quickly recouped and the return on investment continues to increase. The impact of end-stage renal disease on patient health and health care costs is great. Thus, the quality-adjusted survival benefits and overall cost savings seen in benazepril recipients over a long period of time (2 to 7 years) suggest that the strategy of prescribing benazepril to reduce renal disease progression in patients with renal failure is both clinically and economically beneficial.

Pooled outcomes were all-cause mortality and hospitalization for HF; Seventeen studies involving 12,469 patients were included. Overall, ARBs were not superior to controls in combined mortality rates (odds ratio: 0.96; 95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 1.23) or hospitalization (0.86; 0.69 to 1.06). However, stratified analysis showed a nonsignificant trend in the benefit of ARBs relative to placebo in reducing mortality (0.68; 0.38 to 1.22) and hospitalizations (0.67; 0.29 to 1.51) when given in the absence of background ACEI therapy. Compared with ACEIs directly, ARBs were not superior in reducing mortality (1.09; 0.92 to 1.29) or hospitalization (0.95; 0.80 to 1.13). In contrast, combination therapy of ARBs and ACEIs was superior to ACEIs alone in reducing hospitalization (0.74; 0.64 to 0.86) but did not reduce mortality (1.04; 0.91 to 1.20); This meta-analysis cannot confirm that ARBs are superior in reducing all-cause mortality or admissions for HF in patients with symptomatic HF, particularly when compared with ACEIs.

As during the 24-hour period; A total of 406 patients were randomized to an 8-week mandatory titration period with one of the following: 1) 240 mg/day COER-24 verapamil titrated to 360 mg/day; 2) enalapril 10 mg/day titrated to 20 mg/day, 3) losartan 50 mg/day titrated to 100 mg/day, or 4) placebo. Office BP and heart rate and ambulatory 24-hour BP monitoring were performed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks; Compared with placebo, each active treatment lowered BP both in the morning and over the entire 24-hour period. COER-24 verapamil was more effective than enalapril or losartan in lowering morning systolic (-16.6 mm Hg) and diastolic (-11.9 mm Hg) blood pressure (P < .001). For the entire 24-hour period, the effects of COER-24 verapamil (-11.6/-8.4 mm Hg) were comparable to enalapril (- 13.4/-8.3 mm Hg; P = NS). Losartan achieved a similar 24-hour effect on systolic pressure (-9.3 mm Hg), but had less effect on diastolic pressure (-5.4 mm Hg; P = .004 v COER-verapamil).

885,11825317,Angiotensin II receptor blockers for the treatment of hypertension.,,"See, S","The increasing incidence of stroke, congestive heart failure (CHF), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has pointed to the need to increase awareness, treatment and control of hypertension. Effective antihypertensive drugs continue to be needed, as hypertension is the main precursor of various forms of cardiovascular disease. The renin-angiotensin (AT) aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key component in the development of hypertension and may be a target of drug therapy. Angotensin II (ATII) receptor blockers (ARBs) are the newest class of agents available to treat hypertension that work by inhibiting ATII at the receptor level. Currently, national consensus guidelines recommend that ARBs be reserved for hypertensive patients who cannot tolerate angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs). But ARBs are making their way to the forefront of therapy, with a promising role in renoprotection and CHF. Renoprotective Effect of Angiotensin-Receptor Antagonist Irbesartan (IDNT) in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study-Related Nephropathy (IDNT), Effect of Irbesartan on the Development of Diabetic Nephropathy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (IRMA2), and Effects of Losartan on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy ( RENAAL) study demonstrated the renoprotective effects of ARBs in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) adds to the growing evidence that ARBs can improve morbidity and mortality in CHF patients. As a class, ARBs are well tolerated and have a lower incidence of cough and angioedema compared to ACEIs. This article reviews the differences between ARBs, reviews available efficacy data in hypertension, and explores the role of ARBs in CHF and kidney disease.",0,0
886,11825318,Hypertension pharmacotherapy in patients with diabetes mellitus.,,"Deedwania, P C","The coexistence of hypertension and diabetes dramatically and synergistically increases the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. The overwhelming evidence supports the aggressive treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients. However, only a small percentage of diabetic hypertensive patients achieve treatment goals with blood pressure (BP) <130/80 mmHg. Tight BP control is not only cost effective but also more rewarding than glycemic control. The optimal target of BP control in diabetics should be 130/80 mmHg. In patients with diabetes and renal failure, blood pressure should be lowered to 125/75 mmHg to delay the progression of renal failure. The selection of an antihypertensive agent should be based on proven effects on morbidity and mortality rather than surrogate parameters such as lipid or glucose. Limited data suggest that an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) is the agent of choice, particularly in those with proteinuria or renal impairment. beta blockers (betaBs) may be first-line agents in diabetics with coronary heart disease, while thiazide diuretics (TD) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are second-line drugs. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may prove to be as effective as ACEIs in diabetics with hypertension. alpha-adrenergic antagonists (AAAs) should be avoided. Most hypertensive patients require more than one agent to control their blood pressure. There is no evidence to support one combination regimen over others; however, a combination of an ACEI with a TD or a betaB may be the most cost-effective regimens compared to other combinations.",0,0

Cutaneous side effects of captopril include angioedema, anaphylactoid reactions, maculopapular rash, pityriasis rosea-like rash, toxic erythema, and exfoliative dermatitis. Some of the cutaneous adverse reactions from immunological captopril have been diagnosed with patch testing in recent years. This is the first case of cutaneous immune adverse reaction reported for enalapril and lisinopril tolerant captopril demonstrated by both patch tests and double-blind challenge tests. A 71-year-old non-atopic woman experienced a generalized pruritic maculopapular rash. Two months ago, she had started oral therapy with captopril 50 mg per day and glibenclamide 5 mg per day. After the rash appeared, she stopped both drugs and the reaction resolved. Skin biopsy from one of the lesions showed perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the upper dermis. Skin prick tests with captopril and glibenclamide and patch tests with enalapril, lisinopril and glibenclamide with 1% and 10% pet and mercaptobenzothiazole (a chemical containing sulfhydryl group in 1% pet) were negative. Patch tests with captopril alone were positive at 1% and 10% concentrations at 48 hours Oral double-blind loading tests with glibenclamide, enalapril, lisinopril and placebo showed good tolerance Patient was advised to avoid captopril alone Because captopril is the only ACE inhibitor containing a sulfhydryl group and sometimes complex Associated with immunological diseases, this chemical group has been implicated as the culprit of captopril allergic reactions. Lack of cross-reactivity between captopril, enalapril and benazepril has been demonstrated in a few patients by patch tests. patient patch tests identified captopril as the drug likely responsible for an immune adverse reaction not related to the sulfhydryl group.

Serum uric acid decreased moderately, although significantly, in a dose-dependent manner in losartan patients compared to the increase in enalapril patients. A decrease in serum potassium was observed in all patients compared to the pre-study period. In terms of patient satisfaction, there was no difference between the treatments in terms of quality of life. Both drugs have relatively similar hormonal and hemodynamic effects, with an excellent tolerability profile; they appear to cause comparable blood pressure reductions, particularly in hypertensive patients, therapy based on specific Ang II blockade may offer advantages in high-risk hypertensives if left ventricular hypertrophy is present. Both enalapril and losartan can reverse the pathophysiology of essential hypertensive kidney disease in improving kidney function by reducing the intrarenal effects of angiotensin II and should be first-choice drugs in the treatment of essential hypertension.",0,0

Antihypertensive drugs were titrated and combined to lower daytime diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. Echocardiograms were taken at baseline and at follow-up. Mean systolic/diastolic clinical BP, 24-hour BP, and LVM index were similar in treatment-naïve (n=64) and previously treated (n=109) patients, with a mean of 171/102 mm Hg, 151/97 mm Hg, and 118, respectively. g/m2.

Almost all DN in African Americans is caused by type 2 diabetes. Glycemic control and control of blood pressure are essential for prolonging renal survival and protecting against cardiovascular events. Among African Americans, diabetic nephropathy seems to affect women more than men; this may be associated with increased rates of obesity and diabetes in African American women. In addition to gender, the development of albuminuria, family history, and possibly birth weight are factors that predict the progression of kidney disease in African Americans with DN. The impact of glycemic control, appropriate antihypertensives, and optimal blood pressure control in African Americans with advanced DN requires further study.

Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) antagonists can reverse LVH independent of the hypotensive effect in the ESRD setting. Thirty uremic patients with hypertension on chronic hemodialysis were randomly assigned to receive the AT1-R antagonist losartan (n = 10), the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACD) inhibitor enalapril (n = 10), or the calcium antagonist amlodipine (n = 10). Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was measured by echocardiography before and 6 months after treatment. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics did not differ between the three groups. The mean baseline LVM index also did not differ in the three groups. After 6 months of treatment, losartan treatment compared the LVM index (-24.7 +/- 3.2%) to amlodipine (-10.5 +/- 5.2%) or enalapril (-11.2 +/- 4.1%) treatment significantly reduced. All three groups had a similar reduction in mean blood pressure with treatment. Plasma angiotensin II concentration increased 5-fold with losartan treatment. In contrast, plasma angiotension II concentration did not change with enalapril and only increased 2-fold with amlodipine. Therefore, this study demonstrates that despite a comparable depressant effect between the three drugs, losartan regresses LVH more effectively than enalapril and amlodipine in ESRD patients.",0,0

Plasma AII is not completely suppressed during chronic ACE inhibitor therapy. However, the plasma renin angiotensin system (RAS) may have dissociated from vascular tissue RAS. Therefore, we set out to characterize the time course of vascular RAS reactivation during chronic ACE inhibitor therapy; Vascular AI/AII conversion was studied in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) receiving chronic lisinopril therapy with differential infusion of AI and AII into the brachial artery. A cross-sectional study was performed to see if there were differences in vascular AI/AII conversion according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. A second longitudinal study followed 28 patients with NYHA I to II CHF in series for 18 months to see if vascular ACE inhibition gradually disappeared over time despite ACE inhibitor therapy. A third study examined whether increasing the dose of lisinopril affected subsequent vascular ACE inhibition; In the cross-sectional study, vascular AI-AII conversion was significantly reduced in NYHA class III compared with class I/II (p < 0.05). In the longitudinal study, vascular ACE inhibition was significantly reduced at 18 months compared to baseline (p < 0.001), suggesting that vascular ACE is gradually reactivated in CHF over time. In the third study, tissue ACE inhibition can be restored by increasing the ACE inhibitor dose; Vascular AI/AII conversion is reactivated over time during chronic ACE inhibitor therapy, even when the CHF disease course is clinically stable. It also occurs as the CHF disease process progresses. Even if the vascular AI/AII conversion is reactivated, it can be suppressed by increasing the dose of the ACE inhibitor.",0,0

Concern that the risk of ACEI therapy may outweigh the benefit in elderly patients is a possible cause. We extracted the records of 2943 Medicare beneficiaries who were hospitalized for congestive heart failure in 69 hospitals in five states. The presence of LVSD was determined from recorded ejection fractions or narrative description of ventricular function. Discharge drugs and dosages were summarized; Mortality was followed for one year using Health Care Finance Administration MEDPRO files; There were 621 patients aged 65 years and older with LVSD.

This study aimed to investigate whether an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor facilitating bradykinins, algesic peptides and/or an AT1 receptor antagonist could modify hypertension-associated hypoalgesia in humans. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Department.; A total of 22 hypertensive patients were subjected to dental pulp stimulation and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring with 55 normotensive controls to achieve dental pain threshold and tolerance. Hypertensives were then randomized to enalapril or losartan treatment and reassessed 8 weeks after first treatment and 8 weeks after second treatment (dental pain perception and outpatient monitoring); Untreated hypertensives showed a reduced perception of painful stimuli compared with normotensives. A significant reduction in both pain threshold and tolerance was observed during anti-hypertensive treatments (Friedman test: P = 0.007 and P = 0.006), respectively. Pain sensitivity was similar during the two treatments and did not differ from the pain sensitivity values of normotensive controls. ANCOVAs were calculated to assess the relationship between anti-hypertensive agents and pain sensitivity, after controlling for blood pressure. The 24-hour mean pressure served as the covariate, negating any effect of blood pressure; A significant difference was observed when both pain threshold and tolerance were entered as dependent variables (F = 5.28, P = 0.0076, F = 8.16, P = 0.0007, respectively); Both the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and the AT1 receptor blocking agent losartan acted similarly on pain threshold and tolerance, with increased pain sensitivity during the two anti-hypertensive treatments. The blood pressure drop during the drug assumption could not explain the observed pain sensitivity changes. The latter may be due to a specific pharmacodynamic mechanism mediated through angiotensin II AT1 receptors.",0,0

However, as office blood pressure measurements to a limited extent reflect out-of-office blood pressure, a side-arm INSIGHT study was also conducted on patients with both office measurement and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; The study had a randomized, double-blind, parallel group design. After 4 weeks of placebo, mild-to-moderate essential hypertensive patients were randomized to nifedipine GITS 30 mg or amiloride 2.5 + hydrochlorothiazide 5 mg for 3.1 years. Dose titration was accomplished by doubling the dose and adding 25-50 mg of atenolol or 5-10 mg of enalapril or other drugs as needed. The analysis was therapeutic and included calculation of ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate values 24 hours, day and night. Additional analyzes included calculation of the bottom-to-top ratio and the smoothness index (the ratio between the mean and standard deviation of the 24-hour blood pressure drops after treatment); A total of 151 patients were recruited and 149 were eligible for analysis: 78 patients had 24-hour ambulatory records both at baseline and during treatment, and 134 during treatment. Office, 24-hour, and day and night blood pressures were significantly and similarly reduced with both treatments. Office and ambulatory heart rates were left unchanged by diuretics, while slightly lowered by nifedipine. Median trough-to-peak ratios have always been > 0.5 and can be superimposed between the two treatment groups. Similarly, the smoothness indices of systolic and diastolic blood pressures were comparably high for nifedipine and diuretics, thus demonstrating a similar well-balanced antihypertensive response to both drugs. There was no significant difference in the number of cardiovascular events (17 in the nifedipine-based treatment group and 26 in the diuretic-based treatment group) between the two treatment groups; In the INSIGHT study, the prolonged antihypertensive effect and cardiovascular protection of nifedipine on 24-hour blood pressure was similar to that of diuretics.",0,0
909,11875587,Vasopeptidase inhibition: a new approach to cardiovascular therapy.,,"Floras, John S","Omapatrilat is designed to simultaneously inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). The ubiquitination of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, originally conceived as an axis of sodium and fluid metabolism in inflammation, thrombosis, and cardiac and smooth muscle hypertrophy, is an important factor in disease progression for various conditions such as hypertension, heart failure. coronary artery disease and diabetes. Interruption of angiotensin II formation and disruption of bradykinin by ACE inhibition is an important therapeutic advance in the management of these diseases. NEP metabolizes both bradykinin and natriuretic peptides (atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, c-type natriuretic peptide, and adrenomedullin). These peptides counteract the adverse effects of angiotensin II with their vasodilator, natriuretic, diuretic and autonomic neural effects; with its antitrophic effects; and by suppressing plasma renin activity. These two systems can be considered as essential components of a cardiorenal axis that keeps blood pressure and cardiopulmonary blood volume in a constant range. This balance is compromised in the case of heart failure and primary hypertension. The combination of ACE and NEP inhibition should enhance the beneficial hemodynamic and tissue effects of bradykinin and natriuretic peptides. Therefore, vasopeptidase inhibition is a novel approach to cardiovascular therapy with implications for hypertension, heart failure, kidney function, and ischemic heart disease.",0,0

However, its effects in transplant recipients without PTE are uncertain, and the mechanisms of lowering Hb levels in patients with PTE remain unclear. In this study, the effects of losartan and enalapril on Hb levels in relation to serum erythropoietin (EPO) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels were evaluated in 8 patients with PTE and 10 patients without PTE. All 18 patients were treated sequentially with 24 weeks of losartan therapy followed by 24 weeks of enalapril therapy; The two treatment phases were separated by a washout period. Patients with PTE showed significantly higher baseline Hb and IGF-1 concentrations compared to patients without PTE prior to both losartan and enalapril treatments. Baseline serum EPO levels were similar for patients with and without PTE. Baseline Hb level was significantly associated with IGF-1 level (r = 0.517; P = 0.002) but not with EPO level. Treatment with enalapril 5 mg significantly reduced Hb levels in PTE patients than treatment with 50 mg losartan. In patients without PTE, enalapril 5 mg slightly reduced Hb levels, while losartan 50 mg showed no significant Hb-lowering effect. The reduction in Hb levels with enalapril treatment in patients with PTE was associated with a significant reduction in circulating IGF-1 levels, but not EPO levels, whereas losartan reduced Hb levels without significant change in circulating IGF-1 and EPO levels. In patients without PTE, no significant changes were noted in serum EPO and IGF-1 levels in either treatment. The differential Hb-lowering effect of losartan and enalapril therapy in patients with and without PTE suggests that the pathogenesis of PTE is complex and heterogeneous. Different erythropoietic mechanisms may play a role in patients with and without PTE. More large-scale studies are needed to determine the exact interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and the regulation of IGF-1 and EPO synthesis and to define the exact mechanism by which losartan and enalapril lower Hb levels.",0,0

Prescriptions were collected in May and June 2000 to form a study population of 1266 diabetic-hypertensive patients; As monotherapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (37.9%) and beta-blockers (38.3%) were the most commonly prescribed classes of antihypertensives by APs and GPs, respectively. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) ranked third for both physician categories. For the two drug combinations, a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor was the preferred combination for both categories of physicians. Patients managed by APs were more likely to receive a beta-blocker-CCB combination (17.4% vs. 14.9%) or a diuretic-ACE inhibitor combination (16.7% vs 11.4%) and they were less likely to take a beta-blocker-diuretic combination.

The beta-blocker-ACE inhibitor was again the most preferred combination of both FPs and GPs. FPs prescribed CCB-beta-blocker combinations more frequently than GPs (P = 0.01), while CCB-ACE inhibitor combinations were less preferred (P = 0.09). A trend towards overuse of short-acting nifedipine as monotherapy in elderly patients has been noticed by both family practitioners and family physicians.

Middle-aged (45-64 years) patients seen by GPs were more likely to receive glibenclamide (P = 0.001) and less likely to receive gliclazide (P = 0.01) than those treated by FPs. Combinations of a beta-blocker with glibenclamide or insulin were prescribed much more frequently by GPs; In the same practice setting, a significant difference was observed between FPs and GPs in the preference of different classes of drugs for the treatment of diabetic hypertension. The compliance of both FPs and GPs was insufficient; Overall, however, the compliance of FPs was closer to the recommended guidelines.

The OCTAVE trial was expected to produce data in mid-2001, which may allow launching in early 2002 [380280]. Phase III trials for hypertension began in January 1998 [273646]. In January 2001, Merrill Lynch expected BMS to refill its NDA with the FDA in the second half of 2001 [395423]. In February 2001, Credit Suisse First Boston made a similar forecast, adding that it believes BMS will launch the drug in late 2002 or early 2003. Analysts also predicted peak sales of $585 million for the drug in 2005 [399484]. In May 2001, Merrill Lynch estimated sales of $1.8 billion in 2005 [411811].",0,0

English articles were identified. Additional relevant articles were identified from a review of the references of these articles; All identified references were reviewed. All articles considered to be relevant to the topic of this article are included; It has been suggested that the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers may be less in black patients than in other racial groups. Retrospective reanalyses of major heart failure studies have shown that black patients may not experience a significant benefit in morbidity or mortality when heart failure is managed with ACE inhibitors or beta blockers. It has also been suggested that black patients may respond more favorably to the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate than non-black patients; Published reanalyses of ACE inhibitor and beta blocker trials in heart failure provide weak data to support the lack of benefit in black patients. Published literature on this topic is limited by its retrospective nature. Conclusive conclusions regarding the effect of race on the efficacy of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers cannot be made without prospective trials with planned analysis of the effect of race.",0,0

ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) reduce MA and are neutral on total cholesterol and triglycerides. However, the effect of ACE inhibitors and CCBs on lipid subfractions such as Lp(a), apolipoprotein (apo) A1, apo B, and others is unclear. The present study tests the hypothesis that a fixed-dose combination of the ACE inhibitor benazepril (B) and dihydropyridine CCB, amlodipine (A) will further reduce arterial pressure and reduce atherogenic lipid fractions compared to either agent alone; A multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group design was used to study 27 participants with type 2 diabetes. Measurements for total cholesterol, high and low density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL), triglycerides, apo A1, apo B, Lp(a), MA, arterial pressure, and creatinine clearance were obtained at baseline and at 12-week intervals. 36 weeks of study; Arterial pressure was significantly reduced in all three groups at 36 weeks (P = 0.0078 for A, P = 0.0039 for B, and P = 0.0313 for A+B). MA was lowered in all groups with relatively larger reductions versus A in B (P < 0.05) and A+B groups (P < 0.03). An increase in mean HDL-cholesterol from baseline was noted in groups B and A+B; P < 0.05), but not in group A. A trend was also observed between the increase in HDL-cholesterol and the decrease in MA in groups B and A+B. In addition, only group B showed a decrease in the median value of Lp(a) (P < 0.05). These data support the concept that inhibition of ACE by B reduces the atherogenic profile by decreasing Lp(a) and increasing HDL-cholesterol, the latter being associated with reductions in MA. While A+B showed similar trends as B in lipid subfractions and MA, this group had the largest reduction in systolic blood pressure of the three groups. Therefore, the use of A+B offers the benefits of a reduced atherogenic profile, which is more likely to reach target blood pressure, as recommended by national guidelines.",0,0

Normoalbuminuric essential hypertensives under 50 years of age, not previously treated with antihypertensive drugs and without diabetes mellitus were included. After the initial evaluation, patients were treated using only non-pharmacological measures (n=62), beta-blockers (n=38), ACE inhibitors (n=64), calcium channel blockers (n=8), and various classes (n=). 15). Measurements for office blood pressure, biochemical profile, and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion were taken at the start of the study and were measured annually during a mean follow-up of 2.7+/-1.2 years. Of the 187 patients included, 22 (11.7%) developed microalbuminuria (advanced, 4.4/100 patients/year). There were no differences between progressives and those who remained normo-albuminuric (non-progressive) in terms of age, sex, body mass index, duration of disease, blood pressure values, biochemical profile, family history of diabetes or hypertension, smoking habits or presence.

(n=5; 4.1/100 patients/year). No significant differences in the incidence of microalbuminuria were observed between groups when we excluded patients treated with calcium channel blockers or who varied over time between different treatment classes. Progressives showed higher fasting glucose slopes (4.78+/-11.4 versus 0.50+/-6.8 mg/y, P<0.02) and uric acid (0.58+/-0.93 versus 0.05+/-1.10 mg/y, P<0.03) compared to the slopes of those who did not progress. Both glucose and systolic blood pressure slopes over time were independently associated with the slope of the logarithm of urinary albumin excretion when adjusted for age, sex, and treatment groups. The Cox proportional hazards model for progression of microalbuminuria was based on the ratio of baseline urinary albumin excretion (hazard ratio [RR]=1.06; confidence interval [CI] 95%, 1.01 to 1.11), systolic blood pressure slope (RR=1.11; CI 95%, 1.03%). to 1.20) and the slope for glucose (RR=1.08; CI 95%, 1.03 to 1.14) were independently associated with the development of microalbuminuria.

However, the potential relationship of ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) administered to patients with myocardial infarction (MI) to the differential clinical efficacy, i.e., prevention of left ventricular (LV) remodeling, has not been specifically studied so far. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the D/I polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with the incidence of post-MI LV remodeling in patients recruited from the 'Healing and Early Load Reduction Therapy' (HEART) Study. The ACE D/I polymorphism was characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 265 subjects from the 'Treatment of Recovery and Early Load Reduction' Study, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, to determine early or delayed administration. The dose of ACE-I, ramipril, will be optimal in reducing LV enlargement in patients with acute anterior wall MI. The frequencies selected for the ACE D and I alleles were 0.59 and 0.41 (placebo-high-dose group), 0.56 and 0.44 (low-dose-low-dose group), and 0.60 and 0.40 (high-dose-high-dose group), respectively. All observed genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no evidence of an association between genotype and outcome on LV size or function, or with initial blood pressure response (adjusted for covariates) after ACE-I administration. Our data do not provide evidence of an association between the risk of LV remodeling after MI and the ACE D/I polymorphism in the presence of ACE-I therapy and therefore do not suggest that the differential clinical efficacy of ACE inhibitors is associated with it. genetic marker.",0,0

936,11934344,Treatment options for renovascular hypertension.,,"Spence, J David","Renovascular hypertension is usually caused by atherosclerotic narrowing of the origin of the renal artery and is much more common than is thought in patients with peripheral vascular disease, carotid stenosis, or heart failure. Renovascular hypertension should be differentiated from renal artery stenosis. In true renovascular hypertension, the kidney takes responsibility for the blood pressure and does whatever it takes to raise the blood pressure enough to push through the clogged artery. This can be diagnosed by functional tests measuring the glomerular filtration rate before and after blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor AT(1) subtype antagonists. There are insufficient data to make evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of renovascular hypertension. There are only two randomized trials against medical therapy with angioplasty, the larger of which was severely contaminated with angioplasty in the group initially assigned to medical therapy. There is only one trial of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition versus alternative medical therapy. The drugs most effective in the medical treatment of renovascular hypertension - angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor-1 blockers - tend to be avoided for fear of a very rare complication (acute renal failure in patients with severe stenosis of both kidneys). arteries or artery to the only remaining kidney). This fear is unfounded not only because it is rare (< 5% of patients with renovascular hypertension) but because it is reversible and treatable with revascularization. Patients with renovascular hypertension should be evaluated with nuclear medicine differential glomerular filtration rate enhanced by renin-angiotensin system blockers. Revascularization is necessary if medical therapy is ineffective or causes severe renal dysfunction. Some specialists prefer surgical revascularization because of the risk of occasional angioplasty failure and impaired kidney function after angioplasty.",0,0

The observation of a patient whose pemphigus vulgaris (PV) worsened after taking fosinopril prompted us to seek an experimental way to assess liability. Slices of normal human skin (NHS) were simultaneously incubated with progressively diluted solutions of fosinopril and captopril for 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours at 4 degrees C and served as indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) substrates for the 2 serums containing anti-desmoglein-3. used (anti-Dsg3 at 1/160 dilution) antibodies. IIF with captopril was negative regardless of dilution and incubation time. IIF was positive at only 1/40,000 dilution. With fosinopril, IIF was negative for the 2 and 6 hour incubations, but turned positive after 12 hours and thus remained at all other solutions and incubation times. IIF negativity with captopril suggests that anti-Dsg3 antibodies found in PV sera failed to find molecules to bind in the NHS. Captopril therefore induces acantholysis by blocking adhesion molecules. With fosinopril instead, a partial block of adhesion molecules was only seen with the very concentrated solution, unlikely to occur in vivo. Therefore, fosinopril is probably not able to block adhesion molecules in vivo. Our method can be used to confirm the acantholytic properties of a drug.",0,0

The key event is increased glomerular capillary pressure; this impairs the glomerular permeability of proteins and allows excess protein to reach the lumen of the proximal tubule. The secondary reabsorption process of filtered proteins may contribute to renal interstitial injury by activating intracellular events, including upregulation of genes encoding vasoactive and inflammatory mediators. Both interstitial inflammation and disease progression can be controlled by drugs such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which strengthen the glomerular permeability barrier to proteins, thereby limiting proteinuria and filtered protein-dependent inflammatory signals. Clinical data strongly suggest that some patients with chronic kidney disease can now achieve remission. However, due to the existing lag time between treatment initiation and remission, a significant proportion of patients still progress to end-stage renal disease before kidney function begins to stabilize. A multimodal approach that focuses on reducing or eliminating all risk factors associated with progression of renal disease can shorten the duration of disease remission for most patients with proteinuric nephropathy.",0,0

Less is known about specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) commonly used in the treatment of arthritis. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of celecoxib on 24-hour BP levels compared to placebo in patients with hypertension treated with an ACE inhibitor. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial involving 178 men and women (mean age, 53 years) with essential hypertension treated and controlled with lisinopril monotherapy (10 to 40 mg daily). Baseline BP values were obtained using 24-hour ambulatory recordings. Patients received celecoxib 200 mg twice daily (twice the recommended dose for osteoarthritis) (n=91) or placebo (n=87) for 4 weeks, and changes in 24-hour BP, body weight, and clinical laboratory parameters were evaluated. Mean changes from baseline in 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP were 2.6/1.5+/-0.9/0.6 mm Hg on celecoxib versus 1.0/0.3+/-1/0.6 mm Hg on placebo (P=0.34 for systolic BP; P =0.45 for diastolic BP). The proportion of patients whose 24-hour blood pressure increased at least 5, 10, 15, or 20 mm Hg was also similar in celecoxib and placebo. There were no changes in body weight, serum creatinine or potassium in either group. These data therefore indicate that high doses of celecoxib do not have a significant effect on the antihypertensive effect of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. The placebo-adjusted changes observed in 24-hour BP (1.6/1.2 mm Hg) were less than those reported for non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in ACE inhibitor-treated patients.",0,0

Genetically predisposed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors develop severe hypertensive nephrosclerosis without the need for surgical reduction in kidney mass, nephrectomy, renal infarction, or nephrotoxic drugs. In these animals, endothelial dysfunction is considered a valid model for evaluating the efficacy of cardiovascular therapy. SHR was treated at hypotensive doses with either the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril or the angiotensin II (Ang II) AT(1)-receptor antagonist (AIIA) valsartan, and effects on survival rates and cardiac and renal changes were monitored. Rats treated with valsartan alone or in combination with enalapril showed significantly higher survival rates (67-85%, respectively) than untreated animals (37%) or those treated with enalapril alone (55%). Valsartan led to even higher survival rates (95%) at a dose that reduced blood pressure rise. Despite these improved survival rates, drugs at non-hypotensive doses had no effect on the histological appearance and renal function did not improve. Plasma creatinine levels were reduced with valsartan alone or in combination with enalapril, but proteinuria persisted across all treatments throughout the 12 weeks of the study. Aldosterone levels were significantly reduced with all treatments. The results suggest that endothelin has a beneficial role in hypertension. The beneficial renal effects of high-dose valsartan are probably due to a reduction in renal perfusion pressure.",0,0

The effects of ACE-I on various components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) were studied in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving long-term ACE-I therapy; Of 86 type 1 and 2 diabetes patients, 49 were untreated, 25 received captopril and 12 received enalapril as chronic therapy. For determination of plasma renin activity (PRA), serum ACE activity, and plasma angiotensin II (Ang II), blood was drawn approximately 12 hours after the last dose, in the morning (0700-0900 hours) after an overnight fast. PRA and Ang II were measured by RIA and serum ACE activity was assayed by a radiometric assay using (3)H-hippuryl-glycyl-glycine as a substrate; The mean age was significantly higher in patients treated with enalapril. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were not different between captopril-treated and untreated groups. Serum ACE activity in diabetic patients treated with captopril, 101.5+/-42.5 nmol/mL/min, values were obtained in untreated diabetic patients (101.4+/-25.2 nmol/mL/min). In contrast, ACE activity in enalapril-treated patients was significantly reduced (5.5 ± 7.5 nmol/mL/min) compared to untreated and captopril-treated patients. PRA values were significantly increased in patients treated with ACE-I. Plasma Ang II levels were significantly increased in captopril-treated and untreated patients (65.1+/-50.2 and 36.2+/-31.7 pg/mL, p=0.006), while values in enalapril-treated patients were slightly, but decreased, but not significantly (23.8+/-21.4 pg/mL). CONCLUSIONS In diabetic patients receiving enalapril, trough serum ACE activity was not suppressed in diabetic patients receiving captopril, and we therefore question the use of short-acting ACE-Is in these patients.",0,0

Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured in 69 patients with essential hypertension (mild, n = 23; moderate, n = 29; and severe, n = 17) randomly assigned to either imidapril or amlodipine for 24 weeks in a double-blind fashion. During reactive hyperemia and after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin, Imidapril increased the FBF response to reactive hyperemia after 24 weeks of treatment in the mild and moderate hypertensive groups, but not the severe hypertensive group. Compared to imidapril, it was significantly higher in the moderately hypertensive group than in the mildly hypertensive group. Amlodipine did not change the FBF response to reactive hyperemia. The increase in FBF after sublingual nitroglycerin was similar in all groups. L-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, abolished the increase in reactive hyperemia in mild to moderately hypertensive patients. Diseases treated with imidapril. These findings suggest that the effects of imidapril on endothelial function are affected by the severity of hypertension and that the increased reactive hyperemia caused by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor may be due to increased nitric oxide production.",0,0
949,11975824,Lercanidipine: a new dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.,,"Epstein, M","Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have been used in the treatment of hypertension for over 20 years, and recent clinical trials support the efficacy and safety of long-acting dihydropyridine (DHP) CCBs for a wide range of hypertensive patients, including diabetic hypertensive. patients. DHP CCBs are generally effective agents and are particularly effective when used in combination with other agents. Lercanidipine is a new DHP CCB effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. Compared with other DHP CCBs, lercanidipine has a molecular design that provides greater resolution within the arterial cellular membrane bilayer, membrane-controlled kinetics, and high cholesterol tolerance factor. This favorable membrane-controlled kinetics provides a gradual onset of vasodilation and a long duration of action. Furthermore, the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of lercanidipine appear to contribute to its efficacy and favorable safety profile. In clinical trials for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, lercanidipine was administered at an initial dose of 10 mg once daily and increased to 20 mg once daily in non-responders. Studies have shown that lercanidipine has a 24-hour antihypertensive effect and does not cause a significant increase in heart rate. Lercanidipine has been shown to be effective in a wide variety of hypertensive patients, including mild to moderate hypertension, severe hypertension, the elderly, and those with isolated systolic hypertension. It is associated with a low rate of side effects. Because of its efficacy and favorable safety profile, lercanidipine has the potential to improve blood pressure control in a wide variety of patients, including patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to other antihypertensive agents.",0,0

Some pitfalls in measuring glomerular filtration rate in the newborn, mainly caused by postnatal fluctuations in serum creatinine levels, have been highlighted. Serum creatinine levels correlate with the authors' latest finding of tubular reabsorption of creatinine in the immature neonatal kidney. Kidney development in premature and young infants has been shown to be associated with serious medical problems in adult life, including hypertension. This finding offers the pediatrician a new role in the longstanding disease prevention profession. Mutations in a few genes may be responsible for most congenital or inherited renal abnormalities. Two kidney diseases, congenital nephrotic syndrome and neonatal acute renal failure, and renal replacement therapy, a form of treatment for newborn infants, are discussed in detail. These situations are rare in general pediatric practice, but illustrate some recent advances in neonatal kidney care. It is recommended to be careful about the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during pregnancy and newborn period. All nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs administered indirectly to the unborn fetus and directly to the young newborn impair kidney structure (fetus) and function (both fetus and newborn). New data have been obtained with genetic and molecular biology techniques and established methods of developmental kidney physiology. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of neonatal kidney disorders will result in new diagnostic procedures and improved preventive and therapeutic possibilities for the neonate with renal impairment.",0,0

954,11984065,Perindopril: possible use in cancer therapy.,,"Yoshiji, Hitoshi; Kuriyama, Shigeki; Fukui, Hiroshi","Since angiogenesis is required for the growth of any solid tumor, emerging efforts are being made to develop antiangiogenic therapy. However, to date, no antiangiogenic agents have been widely available for the clinical setting. Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used as antihypertensive agents and have recently been suggested to reduce the risk of cancer. Studies have found that perindopril, an ACE inhibitor, is a potent inhibitor of experimental tumor development and angiogenesis at a clinically comparable dose. The potent angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is significantly suppressed by perindopril and also inhibits VEGF-induced tumor growth. In vitro studies have shown that perindopril is neither cytotoxic to tumor cells nor to endothelial cells. Perindopril may represent a potential new strategy for anticancer therapy, as it is already in widespread clinical use without serious adverse effects.",0,0

Plasma fibrinogen showed no significant change with either drug, although there was a trend towards reduction with perindopril; These findings show that perindopril, but not losartan, decreases PAI-1 in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, suggesting that the PAI-1 lowering effect is not related to AT, receptor blockade, and may be due to the presence of endothelial receptors that mediate PAI. Expression of -1 in response to angiotensin II is not type 1 receptor subtypes. The two drugs may also have different effects on the bradykinin system.",0,0

963,12002704,ACE inhibition is superior to angiotensin receptor blockade for renography in renal artery stenosis.,,"Karanikas, Georgios; Becherer, Alexander; Wiesner, Karoline; Dudczak, Robert; Kletter, Kurt","Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, as well as angiotensin II receptor antagonists, can inhibit the vasoconstrictive effect of angiotensin II on the efferent renal vessels, which is believed to play an important role in renovascular hypertension. This effect is hypothesized to be necessary for the demonstration of renovascular hypertension by captopril renography. This study compared the renographic changes induced by captopril and the AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan in patients with a high probability of renovascular hypertension. Twenty-five patients with 33 stenosed renal arteries (grade of stenosis >50%) and hypertension were studied. Captopril, valsartan, and initial renography were performed within 48 hours using technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine. Blood pressure was monitored, plasma renin concentration was determined before and after the intervention, and urine flow was estimated from the urine output of hydrated patients. Changes in renographic curves after intervention were evaluated according to the Santa Fe consensus on ACE inhibitor renography. Captopril renography was positive in 25 of 33 vessels with stenosis, indicating renovascular hypertension, whereas valsartan renography was positive in only ten. Blood pressure during captopril and valsartan renography was not different; the reduction in blood pressure was the same after valsartan and captopril. Plasma renin concentration was comparable for the valsartan and captopril studies, with up to 12 of 25 patients showing suppressed values after intervention. Urine flow after valsartan was higher after captopril (P<0.05). However, this difference could not explain the significantly higher sensitivity of captopril compared to valsartan in detecting renal artery stenosis. Blood pressure response to revascularization was observed in 14 of 25 patients and captopril showed a much better predictive value for renography. It was concluded that captopril renography is much more sensitive than valsartan renography in detecting clinically significant renal artery stenosis. Furthermore, our data suggest that other effects, such as on the prostaglandin-bradykinin system, are of at least similar importance to ACE inhibition for the high diagnostic sensitivity of captopril renography for renovascular hypertension.",0,0

970,12016544,Mechanisms of drug transport in the liver: implications for cholestatic drug reactions.,,"Bohan, Alan; Boyer, James L","Hepatocellular and canalicular transport proteins are the main determinants of hepatic uptake and biliary excretion of xenobiotics and their metabolites. Recent advances in molecular cloning have resulted in the characterization of many of these transport systems. These advances have enabled the identification of a number of drugs that are substrates for transporters and facilitated investigation of the mechanisms of drug-induced cholestasis. This review summarizes the normal function of hepatobiliary transporters and their alteration by drugs or other foreign compounds. Although most of these studies have been performed in animal models of drug-induced cholestasis, the application to human forms of drug-induced cholestasis is also discussed whenever possible. An important finding is that genetic polymorphisms can lead to changes in drug transporter expression and function that may increase susceptibility to cholestatic drug reactions.",0,0

The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial was designed to determine whether the addition of valsartan improves outcomes for patients receiving standard therapy for heart failure, in most cases containing an ACE inhibitor; A total of 5,010 patients with NYHA class II-IV CHF and ejection fraction <40% received valsartan 160 mg twice daily or placebo. The 2 common endpoints were the combination of mortality and morbidity, defined as all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure, resuscitated sudden death, or receiving intravenous inotropic or vasodilator therapy (taking into account hospitalizations) for at least 4 hours. 94% of non-lethal endpoints). Mortality was similar in the 2 groups, but the combined mortality and morbidity endpoint was 13.2% lower with valsartan (relative risk, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.97; P.009), proportion of patients hospitalized for CHF mainly due to reduction in number ( 18.2% versus 13.8%. There were improvements in several secondary endpoints, including ejection fraction, CHF signs and symptoms, and quality of life with valsartan. Of note, analyzes of subgroups identified by baseline background treatment showed highly significant interactions. For example, a small subgroup of 366 patients (7%) not receiving ACE inhibitors had a 33% reduction in mortality and a 44% reduction in mortality and morbidity, whereas the overall trial morbidity and mortality benefit of valsartan was observed in patients receiving ACE inhibitor therapy. no longer significant (relative risk, 0.90; P.10). In the larger subgroup of patients receiving both ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers at baseline, there was a statistically significant 42% increase in mortality with valsartan (P.009) and a trend towards an increased combination of mortality and morbidity (P.10). .; When added to standard therapy, valsartan has no overall effect on mortality and provides a modest (13.2%) reduction in morbidity and mortality. However, this benefit is much greater in patients not receiving concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy and is not statistically significant in patients receiving ACE inhibitors. The finding of a significant increase in mortality with valsartan in patients receiving both ACE inhibitor and beta blocker therapy is somewhat troublesome.",0,0

This situation brings significant costs both to patients in increased morbidity and mortality, and to society in hospitalizations and loss of productivity. This review explores possible causes of non-adherence to treatments in general and antihypertensive drugs in particular. It also looks at how insights into the causes of non-adherence can help us design more effective treatments and discusses existing and emerging drugs in the context of compliance. Since one of the reasons for low adherence is thought to be the impact of a drug on a patient's lifestyle, it can be expected that recently developed agents such as angiotensin II receptor blockers will have less impact on patients' daily lives than previous treatments.

Larger, controlled studies evaluating the increased risk in patients with pulmonary dysfunction are limited. Data from these trials are summarized in this article; The literature shows that patients with primary airway disease such as asthma and COPD are not at increased risk of developing cough or bronchoconstriction as a result of ACE-inhibitor therapy. Despite the ability of ACE inhibitors to improve exercise tolerance, perfusion, and gas transfer, patients with CHF may be at higher risk of developing cough than the general population. It remains unclear whether this cough is due to ACE inhibition or to increased left ventricular dysfunction.

In this study, we investigated the impact of these recommendations by comparing the treatment of hypertension in acute stroke with current guidelines in a tertiary hospital; Retrospective chart review of patients with acute stroke admitted to Ottawa Hospital General Campus for six consecutive months. Antihypertensive drug use (type, dose, route of administration, BP records) in the first seven days after admission was noted; Transdermal nitroglycerin paste was the most commonly used antihypertensive agent. In contrast to the 15% reduction in BP within 24 hours recommended for lowering BP in hypertensive patients with ischemic stroke, use of nitroglycerin resulted in a >15% reduction in BP within the first 24 hours in 60% of cases. Also, despite concerns about sublingual nifedipine, it was the second most commonly prescribed agent. Surprisingly, the mean time to first BP measurement following initiation of antihypertensive therapy was 117 +/- 43 minutes in ischemic stroke and 88 +/- 89 minutes in hemorrhagic strokes; Current guidelines for the management of acute post-stroke hypertension appear to have little impact on prescribing patterns, resulting in significant differences in practice. Such variations, possibly due to uncertainty due to a lack of evidence from randomized controlled trials, are intolerable as patients may be subjected to non-standardised, potentially harmful care, such as inappropriate antihypertensive selection and inadequate BP monitoring, as observed in this study.",0,0

ALLHAT was a large, simple trial designed to closely mimic clinical practice, as it occurred in high-risk hypertensive patients 55 years of age or older. Their goal was to determine whether the incidence of primary outcome, a combination of fatal coronary heart disease and non-fatal myocardial infarction, differed between treatment with one diuretic (chlortalidone) (12.5-25.0 mg/day) and treatment with each of the three. other types of antihypertensive drugs - a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril) and a peripheral alpha-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin) (2-8 mg/day). Doxazosin was recently withdrawn from this trial after an interim analysis showed that it was a secondary endpoint of combined cardiovascular disease in patients receiving doxazosin, which was 25% higher than in patients assigned to chlorthalidone therapy. This finding is largely due to congestive heart failure. Although these findings are indisputably important, the practicing clinician should not completely abandon doxazosin because of ALLHAT findings.

986,12062731,Liver and lovastatin.,,"Tolman, Keith G","Cholesterol-lowering agents known as statins have been used for 15 years and are among the most commonly prescribed drugs. Animal studies and pre-marketing clinical trials have shown signs of hepatotoxicity, primarily minor elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Therefore, all cholesterol-lowering drugs have labeling that requires monitoring of liver enzymes. However, post-marketing experience indicates that hepatotoxicity is rare and it is therefore time to reconsider the issue. The first of the statins, lovastatin, was approved in 1986 and has gained 24 million patient-years of clinical experience. Small elevations of liver enzymes, ie ALT 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), occur in 2.6% and 5.0% of patients at lovastatin doses of 20 and 80 mg/day, respectively. These elevations are reversible with continued therapy, dose related, and possibly related to cholesterol lowering per se. Rare cases of acute liver failure (ALF) have been reported with all cholesterol-lowering drugs. With lovastatin, the rate is approximately 1/1.14 million patient-years of treatment, which is 9% of the background rate for all causes of ALF and approximately equal to the background rate for idiopathic ALF. Monitoring of hepatotoxicity has not been effective in preventing severe liver disease, largely due to its rarity and low predictive value of minor ALT elevations. In fact, it may increase patient risk due to unnecessary discontinuation of cholesterol-lowering therapy for false positive results in patients who benefit from treatment.",0,0

After 10 days of treatment in patients with heart failure due to ischemic heart disease. In addition, the effects of these drugs on blood pressure, heart rate, kidney functions and serum electrolytes, and their efficacy and tolerability in combination with digoxin were investigated. This study was conducted at the Main Alexandria University Hospital Medical Department in Alexandria, Egypt, between May 1999 and May 2000. Diltiazem caused a significant increase in digoxin maximum serum concentration with no significant change in the time to reach maximum concentration and apparent volume of distribution. Total digoxin clearance was significantly reduced and the elimination half-life prolonged. Subsequently, the area under the time-concentration curve and the steady-state digoxin level increased, but were still within the therapeutic range. On the other hand, isosorbide dinitrate significantly increased digoxin maximum serum concentration, but other digoxin pharmacokinetic parameters remained unchanged. While isosorbide dinitrate, not diltiazem, caused a significant reduction in supine and standing blood pressure, neither drug significantly altered pulse rate, renal function, serum sodium potassium, and electrocardiographic pattern; Patients receiving diltiazem showed a mean increase in area under the plasma concentration-time curve of 51%, a 50% increase in mean steady-state serum digoxin concentration, and a 37% increase in peak serum digoxin concentration.

They also experienced significantly fewer serious cardiac adverse events; This study sought to determine the economic consequences of lower event rates in patients given omapatrilat; Economic outcomes (large hospitalizations and associated medical costs) were compared between treatment groups and evaluated using a societal perspective. Hospitalization information was obtained from the standard case report and serious adverse event forms of the IMPRESS study. Hospital costs were assessed by assigning a diagnostic group and an average cost for physician and hospital services at each hospitalization. Emergency room visits were included only when they were made to worsen the heart failure, and Duke University Medical Center's heart failure program assigned costs equivalent to the average hospital and physician Medicare reimbursement for these visits.

997,12082488,The effect of antihypertensive drugs on the fetus.,,"Rosenthal, T; Oparil, S","critical review of the literature on the effects of antihypertensive drugs on the fetus in pregnant women is presented. The questionnaire covers alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists, beta-blockers including topical eye medications, alpha-beta blockers, calcium antagonists, diuretics, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. A lack of data on angiotensin II receptor blockers has been noted, although the effects are thought to be similar to those reported with ACE inhibitors and therefore should be avoided. The literature analysis highlights that some antihypertensive drugs can be used safely at certain stages of pregnancy, while others are questionable and should be avoided at all costs. The lack of placebo-controlled studies on the treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy due to ethical concerns is discussed against the background of the urgent need to treat these women despite the possible harmful effects of antihypertensive drugs.",0,0

The clinical benefit of CRT is still under investigation; Forty-one patients were randomized to four weeks of initial treatment with biventricular or univentricular stimulation, followed by four weeks of no treatment, followed by a second treatment with four weeks of opposite stimulation. Optimal CRT stimulation was maintained for nine months. Cardiac resynchronization therapy was optimized by hemodynamic testing at the time of implantation. The primary endpoints were measures of exercise capacity. Data were analyzed by two-way repeated measures analysis of variance; Left ventricle was selected for univentricular pacing in 36 patients. The clinical effects of univentricular and biventricular CRT were not significantly different. The results of each method were pooled to evaluate the sequential treatment effects. Oxygen uptake during cycling exercise ranged from 9.48 to 10.4 ml/kg/min at anaerobic threshold (p = 0.03) and from 12.5 to 14.3 ml/kg/min and 10.0' at peak exercise (p < 0.001) with first treatment. increased from 10.0. to 10.7 ml/kg/min at the anaerobic threshold (p = 0.2) and from 13.4 to 15.2 ml/kg/min at peak exercise (p = 0.002) with the second treatment.

The aim of this study was to compare the effect of two different renin-angiotensin blocking combinations on blood pressure (BP), albuminuria, and glycemic control. Its design consisted of prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel branches and was performed in a Department of Endocrinology in Spain. 77 type II diabetic patients with stable albuminuria (30-1,000 mg/day) were included. After a 2-week pre-engagement period, patients were randomized to verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 (VT) or losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (LH) 20/12.5 mg/day. The duration of treatment was 1 year. The parameters evaluated were changes in blood pressure, urinary albumin excretion over 24 hours, glycosylated hemoglobin and plasmatic urea. Overall BP decreased significantly from 161.6 +/- 18.7/83.6 +/- 10.2 mmHg to 137.2 +/- 15.7/70.9 +/- 8.3 mmHg (p < 0.0005). Values by treatment were as follows: For VT, 164.3 +/- 18.5/87.2 +/- 10.7 mmHg at baseline and 135.0 +/- 15.1/71.3 +/- 8.4 mmHg at the end. For LH, initially 158.8 +/- 17.4/80.1 +/- 8.4 mmHg and ultimately 139.3 +/- 16.1/70.5 +/- 8.2 mmHg. Albuminuria was significantly reduced from 308.2 +/- 544.7 mg/day to 198.0 +/- 285.3 mg/day.

It is not possible to identify individuals at risk of this adverse effect. Angioedema is mainly associated with high bradykinin concentrations inactivated by ACE. We evaluated the plasma activity of two other bradykinin-catabolizing enzymes (aminopeptidase P and carboxypeptidase N) in 39 hypertensive patients with a history of angioedema during ACE inhibitor therapy and 39 hypertensive patients who had no ACE inhibitor-related adverse events. Plasma activity of aminopeptidase P was lower in patients with prior angioedema than in patients with no angioedema (p=0 003). Our data suggest that low plasma concentrations of aminopeptidase P may be a predisposing factor for the development of angioedema in patients treated with ACE inhibitors.,0,0

LVMI was measured by echocardiogram at baseline and at year 1 and 7. Renal function was assessed by measuring serum creatinine and 24-hour creatinine clearance every 6 months for 3 years, then annually for an additional 4 years. Baseline features were comparable in the two groups. The mean mean arterial pressure during the study was 90 +/- 5 mmHg for the meticulous group and 101 +/- 4 mmHg for the standard group (P < 0.0001). LVMI decreased by 21% in the standard group and 35% in the meticulous group. A mixed model longitudinal data analysis revealed that tight BP control was significantly more effective at reducing LVMI (P < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in kidney function between the two groups. As a result, left ventricular hypertrophy, a major cardiovascular risk factor, was significantly reduced more tightly than with standard BP control. This finding is of particular clinical relevance because cardiovascular complications are the most common cause of death in ADPKD patients.",0,0

Patients younger than 70 years of age with systolic blood pressure (sBP) > or = 100 mm Hg were included in the study. C administration was started in the first 4 days of AMI (mean 21 +/- 24 hours). A control group of 50 C-treated patients and 43 individuals was finally analyzed. C doses were gradually increased from 3,125 every day on day 4 to 25 mg twice daily on day 4. A significant decrease in sBP was observed after C administration 60 and 120 minutes after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd dose on the first day and 30-120 minutes after the first C dose on the 4th day. dBP dropped in just 60-120 minutes after dose 1 on day 1 and 90 minutes after first dose on day 4. Hypotension after 1st and 2nd dose C on the first day resulted in 3 patients (6%) being excluded from the study.

1011,12109041,From toxic precursors to safe drugs. Mechanisms and importance of idiosyncratic drug reactions.,,"Petersen, Karl-Uwe","In adverse drug reactions, the effects described by the pharmacological profile of the drug can sometimes be distinguished from bizarre, unpredictable events (""identicals""). In most cases, the latter results from reactive intermediates formed by members of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These products are often created in very low quantities. However, genetic regulation (for example, increased expression of the catalyzing enzyme or failure of protective factors such as glutathione) or certain external conditions (for example, codification of inducers of drug metabolism) can lead to the presence of toxic intermediates in relevant amounts. Once produced, these metabolites will react with macromolecules and eventually cause cell necrosis. Necrosis may result from direct damage to functions essential to the cell or may be secondary to harmful immune reactions activated by the recognition of new structures as neoantigens. The liver, the main site of drug metabolism, is most often affected by idiosyncratic reactions that are sufficiently noticeable only after a large number of patients have been treated. The unique potential of a drug is related to its chemical structure rather than its pharmacological mechanism. The risks are obvious if the biotransformation yields products with a chemical background such as quinones, phenols, acyl halides, aromatic and hydroxyl amines. There are numerous cases of prodrugs with unique potential being modified or marginalized by agents with more favorable chemical properties. Examples include beta 1-preferred beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (toxic precursor: practolol) and choline esterase inhibitors used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In the second group, tacrine (CAS 321-64-2) causes elevated liver enzyme levels in approximately 30% of patients, an effect not shared with newer, chemically distinct entities. A similar situation exists for the insulin sensitizer troglitazone (CAS 97322-87-7) (marketed, now withdrawn in the USA) and its successors, rosiglitazone (CAS 122320-73-4) and pioglitazone (CAS 111025-46-8). can be done. . Due to its different chemical structure, only troglitazone can be converted to a reactive quinone metabolite, a process that can be accelerated by the drug inducing its own metabolism. Consistent with this view, there is no evidence of specific hepatic toxicity with the two consecutive drugs. Continued progress in molecular toxicology can help minimize the inherent hazards already in the early stages of drug development.",0,0

If necessary, additional agents were added in the following recommended order: furosemide, doxazosin mesylate, clonidine hydrochloride or hydralazine hydrochloride (or minoxidil if needed); In participants randomized to the low MAP target, the percentage of participants achieving a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg increased from 20.0% at baseline to 78.9% 14 months after randomization. The corresponding percentages for regular MAP target participants increased from 21.5% to 41.8%. The difference in median MAP levels between the 2 MAP target groups increased and remained at approximately 12 mm Hg. Blood pressure reduction was similar regardless of age, gender, body mass index, education, insurance or employment status, income or marital status; The blood pressure targets set and achieved in AASK participants clearly demonstrate that adequate blood pressure control can be achieved even in the most difficult-to-control hypertensive populations.",0,0

Doses were then increased to 0.6 mg per day of moxonidine or 20 mg per day of enalapril for 6 weeks. Blood pressure responses to treatment were measured using traditional office techniques and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; The mean reduction in sitting blood pressure with moxonidine was similar to and significantly superior to that achieved with enalapril (24.9 +/- 20.7/13.2 +/- 8.4 mmHg and 21.9 +/- 17.1/11.9 +/- 7.5 mmHg, respectively). seen with placebo (1.2 +/- 14.4/2.3 +/- 7.0 mmHg; p < 0.001).

This is likely related to an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, resulting in reduced heart rate variability (HRV). It is known that decreased HRV in non-diabetic patients is a strong indicator of cardiovascular death. Studies in non-diabetic patients have shown that beta-blockers improve HRV parameters known to reflect parasympathetic function. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of additional beta-blocker therapy on cardiac autonomic function, blood pressure, and urinary albumin excretion in patients with ACE inhibitor-treated Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus with abnormal albuminuria. We examined the effects of 6 weeks of treatment with metoprolol (100 mg once daily, zero-order kinetic formulation) in 20 patients enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial. Patients were followed simultaneously under outpatient conditions with 24-hour Holter monitoring, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and 24-hour fractionated urine collection. Heart rate variability was evaluated by four different methods; ambulatory HRV analysis was performed by spectral and time domain analysis, and short-term spectral analysis and bedside tests were performed on review days; Metoprolol treatment improved vagal tone as assessed by short-term spectral analysis. A 24-hour ambulatory HRV analysis showed improvement in some parameters reflecting vagal function. A small decrease in daytime diastolic blood pressure was demonstrated, no change in diurnal variation of blood pressure or urinary albumin excretion was observed; These preliminary findings suggest that beta-blocker therapy can improve autonomic function in Type I diabetic patients with abnormal albuminuria and associated high risk of cardiovascular disease.",0,0

However, the criteria used to define worsening kidney function are arbitrary and the implications of the different definitions remain unclear. Therefore, we compared the prognostic significance of various definitions of worsening kidney function in 1,002 hospitalized patients for congestive heart failure (CHF); The patient population was 49% female, 67 +/- 15 years of age. Twenty-three percent had a previous history of renal failure, 73% knew depressed ejection fraction, and 63% knew CHF. At the time of admission to the hospital, 47% were taking ACE inhibitors, 22% beta blockers, 70% diuretics and 6% NAIDs. 72% developed an increase in serum creatinine during hospitalization, 20% developed an increase of > or = 0.5 mg/dL. Worsening renal function predicted both in-hospital mortality and length of stay >10 days. Even an increase in creatinine of 0.1 mg/dL was associated with worse outcomes. As the threshold for increased creatinine was increased from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/dL, the sensitivity of death decreased from 92% to 65% and the specificity increased from 28% to 81%. At an increase threshold of 0.3 mg/dL, the sensitivity for death was 81% and the specificity 62% and 64% and 65% for ≥10 days of residence. Adding > or = 1.5 mg/dL improved specificity final creatinine requirement; This analysis shows that any detectable reduction in kidney function is associated with increased mortality and longer hospital stays.

The authors studied 89 Caribbean Hispanic hypertensive patients who participated in six double-blind, randomized trials of antihypertensive agents. Demographics, laboratory data, sodium excretion, plasma renin activity and atrial natriuretic peptide were obtained after 3-4 weeks on placebo. Blood pressure responses to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and fixed combinations of ACE inhibitors and HCTZ were compared with placebo values after 8-12 weeks of treatment. The patients had a multiple risk factor profile (obesity and diabetes) and a wide range of blood pressure elevations, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hypertensive kidney injury. Urinary sodium excretion rates showed that salt restriction was not followed in 65% of patients. Plasma renin activity was lower than that of Hispanic normotensive controls, and 62% of patients had low-renin essential hypertension, creating a renin profile based on sodium excretion. In analysis of variance, blood pressure reductions with calcium channel blockers, HCTZ and ACE inhibitor/HCTZ combinations were significantly greater than with placebo, but not those with ACE inhibitors and beta blockers as monotherapy. The authors concluded that essential hypertension of Caribbean Hispanics is associated with multiple risk factors and is predominantly of the low-renin type. Responses to treatment are consistent with those observed in other populations with a low renin phenotype, suggesting salt sensitivity of blood pressure in this population. Confirmation of the latter has implications for the prevention and treatment of essential hypertension in Hispanics.",0,0

To examine whether this effect is mediated by the reduced effect of angiotensin, we compared the effects of enalapril's direct angiotensin-II antagonist losartan on plasma levels of cAMs and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). In a randomized study, 32 untreated patients (19 men, age 59+/-13) with hypertension receiving co-effective doses of enalapril (mean dose 17 mg/day) or losartan (mean dose 77 mg/day) were recruited. .

The effect of enalapril on percent changes of cVCAM-1 was significantly different from losartan (P=0.0429). Eight weeks of antihypertensive treatment with enalapril instead of losartan significantly reduced plasma cAM and MCP-1 levels in hypertensive patients. The beneficial effects of ACE-Is on cAMs may have implications for atherogenesis and reduction of cardiovascular events, which cannot be fully explained by their antihypertensive effects alone.",0,0

The pathophysiological mechanism is unknown. Recent data suggest that deformability and aggregation of red blood cells may play an important role in regulating blood rheology in hypertension. At the same time, there are reports suggesting that the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) can be counteracted by high doses of aspirin. We hypothesize that these effects may be related to changes in blood rheology. Accordingly, we designed a study to evaluate the effect of low- or high-dose aspirin on the deformability and summability of red blood cells from patients with essential hypertension. Deformability and aggregation of red blood cells were measured by laser diffractometry (Rheodyn SSD, Myrenne GmbH) and computerized automatic aggregometer (MA1 Myrenne GmbH, Germany), respectively. The effects of aspirin on deformability and aggregation of red blood cells were studied ex vivo in whole blood from three groups of patients with essential hypertension (group I: 10 patients receiving placebo, group II: 23 patients receiving aspirin 75 mg/day po for 3 days). day and group III: 23 patients who received 300 mg/day po aspirin for 3 days). Subjects in all groups received the same combination of antihypertensive agents consisting of one of the ACEIs (enalapril or perindopril), one of the beta antagonists (metoprolol or bisoprolol), and a diuretic agent (indapamide). We observed 25% higher erythrocyte aggregation in patients receiving high-dose aspirin (300 mg/day) compared to the placebo group (MEA = 25.8 +/- 6 SD, vs. MEA = 20.6 +/- 3 SD, p < 0.05). ). Aspirin had no effect on deformability of erythrocytes or on arterial blood pressure. In patients receiving antihypertensive therapy, high doses of aspirin or possibly other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may directly affect the rheological properties of blood due to activation of red blood cell aggregation. Increased red blood cell aggregation during antihypertensive therapy may be an important indicator of worsening organ perfusion.",0,0

This study was conducted prospectively in 110 hypertensive children aged 6 to 16 years in two consecutive phases. The primary outcome variable for both phases of the study was diastolic blood pressure while sitting (24 hours post-dose). The primary aim of the first phase of the study was to determine whether enalapril lowered blood pressure in children in a dose-dependent manner. During the 2-week, double-blind, randomized, dose-response period, patients were stratified by weight (< 50 kg or > or = 50 kg), then assigned to one of three dose groups: low (0.625 or 1.25 mg), moderate (2.5 mg). or 5 mg) or high dose (20 or 40 mg). The reduction in blood pressure was studied as a function of dose ratio (1:4:32) and adjusted for weight. After completion of the dose-response phase of the study, patients entered a 2-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal from enalapril or placebo. Antihypertensive efficacy, defined as the sitting diastolic blood pressure difference between the placebo and enalapril groups, was determined. Adverse events were carefully recorded throughout the study. The dose-response relationship for enalapril had a negative slope and was linear over the selected dose range; this suggested that higher doses of enalapril were associated with a greater reduction in blood pressure. Random withdrawal from active drug or placebo confirmed the antihypertensive efficacy of enalapril in the intermediate and high dose groups. The antihypertensive effect of enalapril was maintained across age, gender, race, and Tanner stage. Enalapril appears to be an effective and generally well tolerated antihypertensive agent in children 6-16 years of age. 2.5 mg in children with an initial dose < 50 kg and 5 mg (mean = 0.08 mg/kg) in children > 50 kg once daily effectively lowered blood pressure in most patients within 2 weeks. Blood pressure was lowered in a dose-dependent manner, with larger doses causing a greater reduction.",1,0

Up-titration above conventional doses and combined therapy with other antiproteinuric agents may serve to provide renoprotection in patients at risk for rapid disease progression; The effect of maximum tolerated doses of ACEi (ramipril 15 mg/day, range 5 to 20) alone or in combination with indomethacin (75 mg x 2/day) on urinary protein excretion (UPE) and glomerular barrier size-selective function was evaluated in 19 . patients with chronic non-diabetic nephropathies and persistent proteinuria; Maximum doses of ramipril reduced UPE more effectively than non-ACEi treatment. The reduction in proteinuria was associated with a significant reduction (>50%) in non-selective glomerular membrane shunt, but was not correlated with concomitant changes in arterial pressure and renal hemodynamics and was not affected by duration of treatment. The reduction in UPE and the largest elimination coefficient of neutral dextrans, as studied under the same experimental conditions, exceeded twice the reduction achieved with conventional doses of ACEi in historical controls with similar renal dysfunction and proteinuria. Indomethacin did not affect the renal effects of maximum doses of ramipril and was discontinued prematurely in six patients due to reversible adverse events. Serum potassium was significantly increased in combination with indomethacin alone and never necessitated discontinuation of therapy; Up-titration to maximum tolerated doses safely enhances the antiproteinuric effect of ACEi and may serve to achieve maximum renoprotection in the long term. The combination with indomethacin is poorly tolerated and ineffective. Innovative approaches are needed to use ACEi more effectively.",0,0

However, due to the potential side effects of thyroid hormone, there has been interest in developing analogues with fewer undesirable side effects. Screening for compounds structurally related to levothyroxine identified 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) as an analog with inotropic selectivity and low metabolic activity in hypothyroid rats. When DITPA was administered alone or in combination with captopril in rat and rabbit post-infarction models of heart failure, cardiac output increased and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LV EDP) decreased without increased heart rate. A pilot clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DITPA. In a dose-ranging study in 7 normal volunteers, the drug was well tolerated. A double-blind comparison was then made between DITPA and placebo in a group of 19 patients with moderately severe heart failure. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 1,875 mg/kg DITPA or placebo daily. After 2 weeks, the drug was increased to 3.75 mg/kg per day for another 2 weeks. Cardiac index increased (p=0.04) and systemic vascular resistance index decreased (p=0.02) in heart failure patients who took drugs for 4 weeks. Total serum cholesterol (p = 0.013) and triglycerides (p = 0.005) were also significantly reduced. These results suggest that DITPA is well tolerated and may represent a useful new agent for the treatment of congestive heart failure.",0,0
1036,12165170,Combination antihypertensive therapy in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.,,"Boner, Geoffrey; Cao, Zemin; Cooper, Mark E","Diabetic nephropathy is one of the main causes of end-stage renal disease and is often associated with other macrovascular complications such as ischemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (AIIR) have both been shown to have a protective effect on the progression of diabetic nephropathy, making them the first choice for the treatment of hypertension and/or renal involvement in patients. with diabetes. However, many of these patients, especially those with type 2 diabetes, need two more medications to lower their blood pressure to levels recommended in recently published consensus articles. These target blood pressure levels are 130/80 mm Hg in diabetic subjects with proteinuria up to 1 g/day and 125/75 mm Hg in those with proteinuria greater than 1 g/day. Combinations of different drugs can have a synergistic effect. Some of the early studies using the combination of ACE-I with a non-dihydropyridine or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker showed a synergistic effect on proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, these studies have not been proven, but calcium channel blockers with proven blood pressure lowering abilities play an important role in the treatment of patients with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension. The combination of ACE-I with AIIR may have several theoretical advantages. Many studies using this combination have been done in animal models of diabetes and in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic kidney disease. Some of these studies have shown a synergistic effect of the combination on proteinuria or hypertension, but results have not been consistent across all studies. Until additional studies provide more convincing evidence, it can be concluded that this combination can be used in patients whose proteinuria or hypertension does not respond to either agent as monotherapy or a combination of other drugs.",0,0

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been confirmed to reduce urinary protein excretion (UPE) and reduce the development of kidney damage. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are an alternative class of drugs that inhibit renin-angiotensin system activity with pre-approved renoprotective activity. However, there is a lack of data on the renal protective effect of very small doses of these drugs; Prospective, randomized, 3-month study of the effects of the combination of losartan 25 mg (n = 17) with enalapril 10 mg (n = 17) and losartan 25 mg and enalapril 10 mg (n = 15) on the kidney with proteinuria, normal or slightly decreased kidney function. Function and metabolic profile [creatinine clearance (CRCL) between 36 and 93 ml/min] were performed in 51 patients with biopsy-proven chronic glomerulonephritis. Clinical evaluation and laboratory tests were estimated before treatment (baseline), during the first week, and 3 months after treatment; Monotherapy with losartan and enalapril significantly reduced proteinuria by 25.35% and 45.07%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the groups. Combined therapy provided a more significant reduction in proteinuria (65.96%) than either drug administered alone. This antiproteinuric effect was significantly more pronounced compared to the losartan only group (p = 0.009). The decrease in blood pressure was most pronounced in the combined group. No association was found between UPE reduction and lowering of systolic or diastolic blood pressure in all groups. Significant reduction in CRCL was observed with enalapril treatment immediately after 1 week of treatment (p = 0.039) and at the end of observation (p = 0.043). CRCL remained stable in subjects treated with losartan. No changes were observed in serum creatinine level, metabolic profile, and sodium excretion during treatment in the studied groups; These results showed that even very small doses of losartan and enalapril reduced proteinuria in patients with primary glomerulonephritis. The combination of these drugs can cause significantly greater antiproteinuric effects than either of the agents in monotherapy. Treatment with losartan compared with enalapril is likely to be associated with a lesser risk of acute reductions in glomerular filtration at the start of treatment.",0,0

However, the possible influence of gender on this finding has never been tested; A database of five randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging studies was established to determine the optimal dose of the Per/Ind combination in hypertensive men and women. A total of 2907 patients were treated with either placebo or various combinations associated with Per (2, 4, 8 mg) and Ind (0.625, 1.25, 2.5 mg); In the general population, there was a significant dose-response relationship (P < 0.001) for doubling the Per 2/Ind 0.625 mg dose to Per 8/Ind 2.5 mg with a progressive decrease in SBP, DBP, MBP. When men and women were analyzed by dose, SBP, DBP and MBP (but not PP) were decreased significantly more in women than men until the Per 4/Ind 1.25 dosage was reached. Subsequently, the finding was reversed, with higher doses producing a mild but significant hypokalemia, resulting in a gender interaction in the general population; In hypertensive individuals, the low-dose combinations Per 2/Ind 0.625 and Per 4/Ind 1.25 are most effective in lowering blood pressure and avoiding hypokalemia.

We performed this study to determine whether an increase in ACE inhibitor dose above the maximum antihypertensive effect has additional antiproteinuric potential; Twenty-three proteinuric patients were administered the ACE inhibitor spirapril at an initial dose of 3 to 6 mg/day. The dose was increased every 6 weeks until the maximum antihypertensive effect (spir(max)) as assessed by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (APP) monitoring was achieved, then escalated to a supramaximal dose (spir(supramax)). Renal parameters, urinary protein excretion and systemic activity of the renin-angiotensin system were compared between baseline, spir(max) and spir(supramax). Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were determined before administration of spirapril and after administration of the supramaximal dose; Median ABP and proteinuria were significantly reduced between baseline and spir(max) (median, 102 mm Hg; range, 82 to 122 mm Hg versus 97 mm Hg; range, 82 to 113 mm Hg; median protein, 2.56 g/day; range, 1.05 to 22.1 g/day and 1.73 g/day; range, 0.42 to 4.7 g/d). Both creatinine level and creatinine clearance remained unchanged. Suppression of angiotensin II formation led to a significant increase in renin and angiotensin I concentrations and a non-significant decrease in aldosterone levels. Increasing the supramaximal dose of spirapril had no further effect on serum renin or angiotensin I levels or proteinuria. There was an additional slight decrease in aldosterone levels followed by a significantly lower level than baseline; Our results show that the antiproteinuric effect of spirapril is related to its antihypertensive effect. Although high-dose ACE inhibitor therapy has no additive effect on proteinuria, a possible beneficial long-term effect cannot be excluded.",0,0

Access to individual data allowed joint protocol design to compare 5-year mortality between CDS and surgical strategy of ECSS; CDS recommended bypass surgery (BS) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in 93% and medical treatment alone in 7%, while 94% of 394 patients randomized to surgery (Euro-S) in ECSS received BS. The operative mortality was 3.2% for Euro-S, while in CDS there were no operative deaths, reflecting medical progress over two decades. However, 5-year mortality for CDS initially decreased when the risk ratio was adjusted for age, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension (95% CI 0.26–0.93 with RR = 0.49) p = 0.03, suggesting the need for improved comprehensive medical care.",0,0

Correction of these factors leads to a reduction in the progression of plaque formation and associated arterial wall thickness. However, atheroma remains a focal disease that develops in characteristic areas of the arterial tree. These regions are typically in areas of vessel branching or prominent curvature and correspond to regions of high tensile stress and low steep stress, leading to the hypothesis that local hemodynamic factors and vessel wall mechanics reinforce the focal development of atheroma. Current assessment of vascular hemodynamics suffers from an inability to handle complex flow and does not allow accurate determination of locally varying flow and shear stress patterns. However, the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) flow simulation techniques to ultrasound and local pressure data allows a comprehensive, non-invasive assessment of hemodynamic flow parameters to be performed. The Candesartan cilexetil and Atenolol Carotid Hemodynamic Endpoint Trial (CACHET) study compares the effects on carotid intima-media thickness of two antihypertensive regimens, one based on a b-blocker and the other based on an angiotensin receptor blocker. The collection of ultrasound and pressure data for each subject provides a unique opportunity to apply this data to the CFD model to examine the effects of these antihypertensive regimens on local fluid dynamics. This will lead to a better understanding of the relationship of these factors to atheroma formation and regression.",0,0

The analysis was therapeutic; During a mean follow-up of 2.7 (0.9) years, 946 deaths occurred: 499 (18%) in the losartan group and 447 (16%) in the captopril group (relative risk 1.13 [95% CI 0.99-1.28], p = 0.07). The outcomes for the secondary and tertiary endpoints were as follows: sudden cardiac death or resuscitated cardiac arrest 239 (9%) and 203 (7%), 1.19 (0.98-1.43), p=0.07 and fatal or fatal non-re-infarction 384 (14%), 379 (14%), 1.03 (0.89-1.18), p=0.72. All-cause hospitalization rates were 1806 (66%), 1774 (65%), 1.03 (0.97-1.10), p=0.37. Losartan was significantly better tolerated than captopril, with fewer patients discontinuing study drug (458 [17%] vs. 624 [23], 0.70 [0.62-0.79], p<0.0001); ACE inhibitors should remain the first-line therapy in patients after complicated acute myocardial infarction, as we saw a non-significant difference in overall mortality favoring captopril. Losartan cannot be generally recommended in this population. However, it was better tolerated than captopril and was associated with significantly less discontinuation. Although the role of losartan is not clearly defined in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibition, it may be considered in such patients.",0,0

Hypertensive individuals and normotensive individuals evaluated before starting drug therapy constituted the control groups. All groups were analyzed by psychological methods (BDI, HSC, Raven's Matric test). There was no significant difference between the groups in BDI, total score and certain factors. In HSC, there were significant differences in overall ratings between the untreated hypertensive subjects and the normotensive group (p < 0.05). The depression/anxiety profile was the main factor contributing to it being significantly different in these groups (p < 0.05). Enalapril and captopril only moderately reversed hypertension-induced adverse behavioral changes without statistical significance. There were no changes in intellectual abilities tested with the Raven's Matric test in any of the groups studied. Consequently, the significant negative emotional effects of high blood pressure can only be partially reversed by antihypertensive doses of enalapril and captopril.",0,0

Biopsies from 10 normal kidney donors were used as controls. At the start of the study, 50 diabetic patients had increased mesangial and endothelial cell counts compared to control subjects. There was no difference in the number of podocytes. Glomerular volume increased in diabetic patients, but the surface area of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) beneath the podocytes did not differ between groups. AER was positively correlated with mesangial cell count in microalbuminuric patients (r = 0.44, P = 0.012) and negatively correlated with podocyte count (r = -0.48, P = 0.040) in proteinuric patients. In 16 placebo-treated patients, glomerular volume increased after 3 years due to matrix deposition and increased GBM surface area. Although the overall cell count was not significantly different from baseline, the decrease in podocyte count at follow-up correlated with AER at follow-up (r = -0.72, P = 0.002). In conclusion, cross-sectional analysis of podocyte counts in patients with type 1 diabetes with high AER but normal blood pressure did not show a significant reduction compared to non-diabetic control subjects. Longitudinal data provide evidence of an association between podocyte loss and AER, but it remains unclear whether the cellular changes are a response to, a cause, or concomitant with the progression of nephropathy.",0,0

However, little is known about the effect of antihypertensive therapy (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors - ACEI) on cardiac ANS activity; The aim of the study was to evaluate HRV circadian changes in patients with essential hypertension treated with ACEIs for one year. Ten patients with essential hypertension aged 26 to 64 years (mean 54.3 +/- 12.3) and 10 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were eligible for the study. In both groups, 24-hour arterial blood pressure measurements were made with simultaneous ECG monitoring. Hypertensive patients were examined before and after 1 year of ACE inhibitor (enalapril) intake. HRV analysis was performed with fast Fourier transform (FFT). Time and spectral parameters were compared during the day (6 am to 22 pm) and night time (10 pm to 6 am) in 8 studied subjects characteristic of scoops; Results obtained before treatment presented the nighttime increases of mean values of RMSSD (p < 0.05), pNN50 (NS, p > 0.05), VLF, LF (p < 0.05) and HF (NS) with a decrease, as in the control group. LF/HF ratio (p < 0.05). Similar trends in cardiac ANS activity were observed 1 year after enalapril ingestion. Comparison of HRV of the day before and after one year of ACE inhibition revealed an increase in parasympathetic system values: RMSSD, pNN50 (p = 0.01) and HF (NS), a decrease in LF/HF ratio (p < 0.01). Evaluation of nocturnal HRV parameters showed an increase in HF mean value (p < 0.05) without any other significant changes between trials; After 1 year of ACE inhibitor administration, only improvement in parasympathetic activity of the day was observed. Nocturnal vagal activity, which has been suggested as one of the main factors in the development of hypertension, remained unchanged in patients included in the ""scoop"" hypertension group.",0,0

Large-scale, randomized, controlled trials have greatly contributed to our understanding of the management of life-threatening arrhythmias. There are many causes of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, most often occurring in the setting of healed myocardial infarction. Current treatments for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias include antiarrhythmic drugs, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and catheter ablation. Each treatment provides unique benefits for selected patients with life-threatening arrhythmias. Since the goal of arrhythmia management is to provide not only the best single therapy but also the greatest assurance of symptomatic arrhythmia control, the use of combined therapy has become a standard treatment strategy for patients with persistent ventricular arrhythmias. This review will discuss the different modes of therapy available and their potential risks and benefits for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The rationale for using hybrid or combination therapy will be presented. Finally, some of the better known primary and secondary prevention studies for the treatment of ventricular tachycardias will be reviewed.",0,0

Trained interviewers administered the four subscales from the Marking Tests (Monitoring A and B), the Brief Assessment Index (a measure of depressed mood), and the Illness Impact Profile (Ambulation, Social Interaction, Sleep and Rest, and Housework); Six hundred and ten patients completed an initial and at least one follow-up questionnaire. In actively treated patients, particularly at the first 6-month follow-up, trail-making scores were slower when between-group effect sizes were 0.25 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.43] and 0.13 for Tracing A ( 95% CI -0.05 to 0.31) for Trace B. During the 4-year follow-up, patients on active therapy were more likely to report problems on the Social Interaction scale than patients treated with placebo (odds ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.69), equivalent to a 7% difference.

The hypotensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) has been observed to be at least partially mediated by NO. We performed an in-patient crossover study to investigate the potential effect of NAC on the ACEI antihypertensive effect through a NO-dependent mechanism. We studied 18 smokers (>10 years habituation and >10 cigarettes per day) hypertensive patients (15 males and three females, aged 69+/-5 years) receiving ACEI therapy (11 captopril and seven enalapril). Patients were randomly divided into two treatment arms. In one arm, patients (n = 10) initially received the addition of NAC (600 mg daily) to the ACEI regimen. Patients in the other group (n=8) remained on ACEI only. After 21 days, the therapeutic patterns were crossed. The first group received only ACEI, the second group ACEI and NAC and completed the other 21 days of treatment. We assess the impact of NAC on each patient with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) performed at the end of each therapeutic regimen. The combination of ACEI and NAC (ACEI + NAC) resulted in a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic 24-hour blood pressure (24 hBP) and daytime BP (dtBP) compared to the period with ACEI alone: 24 hBP = 146.1 +/- 4.2 137 +/- 3.1 (p < 0.05) and 89.2 +/- 2.8 versus 83.5 +/- 3.7mmHg (p = 0.01). DtBP: 149.7 +/- 5.6 - 141 +/- 3.7 and 92.1 +/- 4 - 86 +/- 3.2 (both, p < 0.05). No significant difference was observed in nighttime blood pressure (ntBP). The NAC effect was not statistically different for the two ACEIs. In conclusion, the addition of NAC to an ACEI potentiates its antihypertensive effect during 24hBP and dtBP in hypertensive smokers. This effect may be mediated by a NO-dependent mechanism, possibly through the protective effect of NAC on NO oxidation.",0,0

At the end of a 3-week placebo acclimation period, patients received either T (40 mg) or P (4 mg) once daily for a period of 12 weeks. A double dose regimen was given to patients whose clinical DBP remained at or above 90 mmHg at the end of the sixth week. SBPM was performed at 3 different times over 7 consecutive days: at the end of the washout period (W0), at week 6 (W6) and at week 12 (W12). A clinical blood pressure (BP) determination was also performed at each visit using the same automated device used for SBPM; 671 patients were selected and 441 were randomized (age: 55 +/- 12 years: 240 men and 201 women). Study populations were: the safety population (n = 441, T = 220; P = 221), the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (n = 435, T = 217, and P = 218), and the protocol population per capita (n = 368, T = 188; P = 180). ITT analysis showed a greater trough DBP decrease with T from W0 to W12 compared to P (T: -6.6 +/- 6.7 mmHg and P: -5.1 +/- 7.0 mmHg; based on ANOVA for repeated measurements p = 0.018). Concerning clinical BP, the same results were observed. Similarly, per-protocol analysis provided similar findings. Doubling dose was significantly less frequent with T (41%; n = 85) compared with P (55%; n = 115; p = 0.005). The overall frequency of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups: T = 34% (n = 74) vs p = 32% (n = 70). Most were mild to moderate and transient.

At baseline, pulse pressure and mean pressure were determined from six conventional blood pressure (BP) readings and 24-hour ambulatory recordings. We calculated the mutually adjusted relative hazard ratios associated with 10 mm Hg increments in pulse pressure or mean pressure, adjusting for significant variables. In the placebo group, 24-hour and nighttime pulse pressures consistently predicted total and cardiovascular mortality, all cardiovascular events, stroke, and cardiac events. Daytime pulse pressure predicted cardiovascular mortality, all cardiovascular endpoints, and stroke. Hazard ratios for 10 mm Hg increases in pulse pressure ranged from 1.25 to 1.68. Conventionally measured pulse pressure predicted cardiovascular mortality with a hazard ratio of only 1.35. In the active treatment group, the association between outcome and ambulatory pulse pressure was reduced to an insignificant level compared with the placebo patients. Mean pressure determined from ambulatory or conventional BP measurements was not associated with worse prognosis.

All three groups decreased left ventricular mass index (Losartan 154.5 +/- 9.9 to 114.6 +/- 5.8 g/m2: p = 0.0002) (enalapril 155.6 +/- 14.3 to 135.3 + /- 10.4 g/m2: p = 0.0275) (amlodipine 156.6 +/- 7.3 to 137.2 +/- 4.1 g/m2: p = 0.0589). The three groups showed similarly significant reductions in mean blood pressure. Plasma angiotensin II concentration increased significantly 5.0-fold on Losartan treatment compared to control levels before treatment, whereas it was unchanged in enalapril and only 2.0-fold in amlodipine treatment. This study shows that losartan reduces left ventricular fibrosis and this effect may be through an anti-AT1-R effect.",0,0
1082,12401122,Effect of drugs and gender on arterial pulse wave and natriuretic peptide secretion in untreated patients with essential hypertension.,,"Deary, Alison J; Schumann, Anne L; Murfet, Helen; Haydock, Stephen; Foo, Roger S; Brown, Morris J","Recent studies have suggested that mean pressure and pulse pressure have a differential effect on myocardial infarction and stroke, and differences between parent drugs in their effectiveness in preventing these individual endpoints. We hypothesized that although the effects of antihypertensive drugs on blood pressure are the same, they have different effects on the pulse wave. We studied 30 untreated hypertensive patients aged 28-55 years and rotated over a six-day treatment period of 6 weeks with amlodipine 5 mg, doxazosin 4 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, bisoprolol 5 mg, bendrofluazide 2.5 mg or placebo. The best drug was repeated at the end of the rotation. Blood pressure readings and radial pulse tonometry (by Sphygmocor) were taken at each visit, and blood was drawn for measurement of atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The Sphygmocor derivative of the central aortic pulse wave was used to measure the conduction time of the reflected wave (T(R)) and the augmentation index (AI), which is the proportional increase in systolic pressure due to the reflected wave. There was a dissociation between the effects of drugs on blood pressure and pulse wave analysis. Bisoprolol caused the greatest reduction in blood pressure and T(R), but was the only drug that increased AI. This paradoxical response to bisoprolol was associated with a 3-fold increase in plasma BNP levels. As previously described, there was a smaller elevation in BNP in women compared to men, and this elevation was also associated with significantly higher AI values. Other drugs reduced AI and this was associated with a significant reduction in BNP by amlodipine. In conclusion, antihypertensive drugs differ in their short-term effects on increasing systolic pulse wave and BNP secretion from the heart, considered a sensitive measure of tension in cardiomyocytes. These differences may help explain cause-specific differences in outcome in recent research.",0,0

However, data from randomized clinical trials are limited. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of vitamin E supplementation on major CV outcomes and development of nephropathy in people with diabetes. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Assessment (HOPE) study is a randomized clinical trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design evaluating the effects of vitamin E and ramipril in patients at high risk for CV events. Patients were eligible for the study if they were 55 years of age or older and had CV disease or diabetes with at least one additional coronary risk factor. The study was designed to recruit large numbers of people with diabetes, and analyzes of the effects of vitamin E in this group were planned ahead of time. Patients were randomly assigned to daily treatment with 400 IU of vitamin E and 10 mg of ramipril or their respective placebos and were followed for a mean of 4.5 years. The primary study outcome was a combination of myocardial infarction, stroke, or CV death. Secondary outcomes included total mortality, hospitalizations for heart failure, hospitalizations for unstable angina, revascularizations, and overt nephropathy; There were 3,654 diabetic patients. Vitamin E had a neutral effect on the primary study outcome (relative risk = 1.03, 95% CI 0.88-1.21; P = 0.70), each component of the composite primary outcome, and all predefined secondary outcomes; Daily administration of 400 IU vitamin E for an average of 4.5 years to middle-aged and elderly people with diabetes and CV disease and/or additional coronary risk factor(s) has no effect on CV outcomes or nephropathy.",0,0

Two-dimensionally guided M-mode echocardiograms were performed at screening (recruitment screening), randomization (baseline screening), and after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment. Baseline and treatment echocardiograms were read in two central laboratories without screening time sequence information. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) analyzes (196 patients), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP) were significantly and equally reduced by the two treatments. Candesartan and enalapril reduced LVMI to the same extent, 15.0 and 13.1 g/m2 (-10.9 vs -8.4%; P<0.001 for both). The proportion of patients achieving normalization of LVMI was insignificantly higher with candesartan (36.3% vs. 28.6%). Similar results were obtained in the per-protocol (PP) analyzes.

Twenty-seven hypertensive patients were randomized to receive lisinopril (20 mg) or losartan (50 mg) for 5 weeks and then switched to alternative therapy for a second 5-week period. Measurements of CBP, 24-hour ABP, and 5-day HBP were performed before randomization and at the end of each treatment period. All measurement methods showed that lisinopril was more effective at lowering blood pressure than losartan. However, the difference between the two drugs was demonstrated with greater precision using HBP (P<0.001) compared to 24-hour ABP (P<0.01), while the weakest precision was provided by CBP (P<0.05) to show this difference. Lisinopril was also found to be more effective than losartan in reducing HPP (P=0.01) and 24-hour APP (P=0.03), although no such difference was found using CPP measurements. It was concluded that the effects of antihypertensive drugs may differ not only on BP but also on PP. HBP monitoring appears to be as reliable as 24-hour ABP monitoring in detecting differences in the effect of drugs on both BP and PP. Clinical measurements seem to be the least reliable method for detecting differences, especially in PP.",0,0

1093,12461307,Sexual dysfunction in patients with hypertension: implications for treatment.,,"Ferrario, Carlos M; Levy, Pavel","Sexual dysfunction associated with hypertension or antihypertensive treatments may affect patients' ability to continue treatment and may impair patients' quality of life. Therefore, it is important for practitioners to be familiar with the wide variation in sexual side effects produced by antihypertensive agents and to discuss the possible occurrences of these side effects with their patients. In many cases, a change in a patient's medication regimen can help patients overcome certain sexual side effects experienced with certain treatments. Practitioners should consider choosing an antihypertensive therapy that is highly effective in lowering blood pressure but preserving patients' quality of life. The effect of drugs on sexual function is controversial. Some blinded studies report little difference between placebo and specific drugs, while other studies show that antihypertensive drugs increase sexual dysfunction with an impact on quality of life. Recent evidence suggests that losartan, an angiotensin II antagonist, is not typically associated with the development of sexual dysfunction and may indeed positively affect several indicators of sexual function (erectile function, sexual satisfaction and frequency of sexual activity) as well as perceived quality of life. . Therefore, angiotensin II antagonists may offer a therapeutic option to prevent or correct erectile dysfunction in patients with hypertension. The positive effects of these agents on sexual function may be related, in part, to their ability to block angiotensin II, which has recently been recognized as an important mediator of detumescence and possibly erectile dysfunction.",0,0

Mode of death was classified by trial experts and an independent endpoint committee; Age, male gender, pre-existing ischemic heart disease, increased heart rate, creatinine concentration, and some drugs taken at randomization were predictors of increased risk of all-cause death and cardiovascular death. Sudden death risk markers were different from the risk markers for death from chronic heart failure. At baseline, low systolic blood pressure, elevated creatinine, decreased serum sodium or hemoglobin, and increased heart rate were associated with chronic heart failure death. Use of beta-blockers or antiarrhythmic agents (mainly amiodarone) was associated with a reduced risk of sudden death, while previous use of long-acting nitrates and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were markers for increased risk; Using competing risk analysis on data from the ATLAS study identified variables associated with certain modes of death in heart failure patients. This approach to analyzing outcomes may make it possible to predict which patients might benefit most from certain therapeutic interventions.",0,0

However, pathophysiological studies suggest potential harm in excessive lowering of blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients with ischemic heart disease; We analyzed data from the GISSI-3 (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravivenza nell'Infarto miocardico) study to evaluate the effects of early treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during AMI in patients with a history of hypertension compared with normotensive patients. The trial randomly assigned 19,394 patients to 6 weeks of lisinopril treatment or control who started treatment within 24 hours of onset of AMI; In 10,661 normotensive patients, lisinopril significantly reduced fatalities, but in 7362 hypertensive patients, a higher rate of fatalities was reported on the first day of treatment, with benefits appearing only later. These results are attributable to the subgroup of 1165 hypertensive patients with low baseline systolic blood pressure (lower quintile, blood pressure <120 mm Hg) who were more prone to develop critical hypotension after lisinopril treatment. In fact, these patients showed a higher mortality rate as a result of extreme cardiogenic shock (odds ratio 3.07, 95% CI 1.39-6.77) on the first day of lisinopril treatment and a persistent, unfavorable mortality trend after 6 weeks; These data suggest that caution should be exercised when using lisinopril in the acute phase of myocardial infarction in patients with a history of hypertension but low systolic blood pressure at presentation.",1,1
1098,12487393,Strategy for the treatment of maladaptive hypertensive patients on hemodialysis.,,"Ross, E A; Pittman, T B; Koo, L C","Hypertensive hemodialysis patients who do not comply with their medications cannot benefit from pharmacological developments in the treatment of high blood pressure and increase their already high risk of cardiovascular complications. Those who refuse to take medication at home, drink excessive fluids, miss multiple dialysis sessions, and end the dialysis session early are often frustrated by severe hypertension. In addition to addressing the psychosocial, financial, educational, and substance abuse issues that contribute to maladjustment, we have developed a drug therapy strategy that will serve as at least a temporary way to lower blood pressure. Patients who did not or did not receive this or any dose were administered antihypertensive agents (transdermal clonidine and amlodipine) with a long half-life in renal failure and/or intrinsically long-acting (transdermal clonidine and amlodipine) on dialysis days. on their own. It was ensured that lisinopril and amlodipine were taken at least on dialysis days (three times a week) and that the clonidine patch was changed weekly. Therefore, sixteen patients who were unable to self-administer the drugs reliably were treated. They experienced a significant reduction in systolic pressure of 15 mm Hg (175 +/- 6 to 160 +/-5 mm Hg) and diastolic 12 mm Hg (103 +/- 3 to 91 +/- 3 mm Hg) before dialysis. and an average pressure of 13 mm Hg (127 +/- 4 to 114 +/- 4 mm Hg). There was an improvement in chest pressures after dialysis with a 13 mm Hg decrease in mean pressure from 110 +/- 4 to 97 +/- 4 mm Hg. Many people had erratic blood pressure control, did not go on dialysis intermittently, and therefore continued abuse of the medication given by the unit, as well as fluid or medication. Patients accepted this regimen uniformly, even if spontaneously requested it, with no appreciable side effects. In summary, while non-adherence is handled by the entire medical team, administration of long-acting drugs in the dialysis unit helps many hypertensive dialysis patients who would otherwise be at high risk for serious cardiovascular complications.",0,0

Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been reported to contribute to intrarenal hemodynamic abnormality in diabetic patients. We examined whether RAS blockade by captopril causes intrarenal hemodynamic changes in normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes; The ages of the patients were between 40 and 65 (20 men and 20 women). A total of 15 age- and gender-matched healthy individuals served as control subjects. The refractive index (RI) of the interlobar arteries was evaluated by duplex Doppler sonography before and after the oral captopril (25 mg) test; At baseline, no significant differences in RI values or plasma renin activity (PRA) were seen between patients and healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, RI values after captopril testing were significantly higher than baseline values (P < 0.01). However, in patients with type 2 diabetes who had both normoalbuminuria and microalbuminuria, post-test RI values were significantly lower than baseline values (P < 0.001). There were significant negative correlations between DeltaRI value and HbA1c (r = -0.458, P < 0.005) and between DeltaRI value and baseline PRA (r = -0.339, P < 0.05) in diabetic patients. Multiple regression analysis showed that HbA1c and baseline PRA significantly and independently affected the magnitude of the reduction in RI values after administration of captopril in diabetic patients (R2 = 0.391, P < 0.0001); These results show that intrarenal RAS may be activated in diabetic patients, this activation may be affected by poor glycemic control, and blocking RAS activation by ACE inhibitor reduces intrarenal vascular resistance in diabetic patients. The results highlight the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition in improving intrarenal hemodynamics in diabetic patients.",0,0

Both of these classes of agents have a primary mechanism of action to reduce the level of the associated risk factor. They also have mechanisms of action that may provide benefits beyond what is believed to be the primary action of the agent. This has led to speculation that statins reduce stroke risk beyond lowering cholesterol, and ACE inhibitors reduce stroke risk beyond lowering blood pressure.

The critical roles of transient delay and optimal sustained patency as successful modulators of reperfusion have been repeatedly demonstrated, and research continues into the ideal interface between pharmacological and mechanical reperfusion. Despite physician awareness and patient education programs, the time from symptom onset to treatment in STEMI has stopped at approximately 3 hours for pharmacological reperfusion as documented in large clinical trials. Multiple improvements with advanced paramedic training, conductable 12-lead electrocardiograms and bolus fibrinolytics facilitate possible prehospital diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, as we move into the 21st century, it is essential to reconsider strategies to address these and other issues related to the process of providing optimal care to most patients with STEMI. Particularly noteworthy are the opportunities provided through prehospital management as important potential ways to initiate treatment, triage appropriate hospitals, or both to further improve patient outcomes.

However, direct comparisons between different ACE inhibitors in the same patient population have not been made.; This phase III, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study compared the safety and efficacy of zofenopril and lisinopril in 1024 thrombolyzed patients with acute MI. Patients aged 18 to 75 years were randomized to receive oral zofenopril (30-60 mg/day) or lisinopril (5-10 mg/day) for 42 days, starting within 12 hours of completion of thrombolytic therapy. The primary study endpoint was the cumulative or drug-induced incidence of severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg). Secondary endpoints included additional security and efficacy parameters; The overall incidence of severe hypotension was slightly reduced with zofenopril (10.9%) compared with lisinopril (11.7%, P = 0.38). The incidence of severe drug-induced hypotension was slightly but significantly lower with zofenopril compared with lisinopril (6.7% vs. 9.8%, 2-tailed P =.048). The 6-week mortality rate was 3.2% in the zofenopril group and 4.0% in the lisinopril group (P = .38), with no significant difference in the incidence of major cardiovascular complications or any safety variables observed between the 2 ACE inhibitors. ; The SMILE-2 study demonstrates that both zofenopril and lisinopril are safe and associated with a very low rate of severe hypotension when administered on a dose-titrated schedule to thrombolyzed patients with acute MI. These findings may have a positive clinical impact and increase the proportion of acute MI patients who can be treated safely with ACE inhibitors.",1,0

As drugs that selectively block these systems are developed, the reduction in BP may not be consistent over 24 hours; A total of 24 untreated patients (>65 years) with systolic BP (SBP; >150 mm Hg) were included in a substudy of a larger study in 74 patients. In a double-blind, crossover study with a balanced design, they received placebo, atenolol 50 mg, perindopril 8 mg, felodipine 10 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg. Working time was 2 months.

The drug was taken at 9:00 am; The four drug classes reduced mean 24-hour SBP (P < .05), but the reduction was less with atenolol than with other drugs. The reduction in awake BP with perindopril was less than with felodipine or hydrochlorothiazide. Atenolol did not cause a significant decrease in sleep or morning SBP, and decreases with the other three drugs were significant and greater than decreases with atenolol. The reduction in sleep BP was greater with perindopril than with other classes of drugs. The wake-sleep difference in SBP increased with perindopril, remained the same with felodipine and hydrochlorothiazide, and decreased with atenolol; In this study, the response to different classes of drugs was different. Response to drugs that work relatively non-specifically (diuretics, calcium blockers) was relatively consistent over 24 hours.

Arterial hypertension is associated with increased vascular tone of resistance vessels, decreased compliance of conduit arteries, and intima-media thickening leading to vascular remodeling. Dysfunctional endothelium triggers such maladaptive processes. It has been shown that the bioavailability of nitric oxide decreases in hypertensive individuals depending on the duration and severity of arterial hypertension. While angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reverse endothelial dysfunction, a concomitant reduction in major cardiac events due to improved bioavailability has yet to be determined. Long-term follow-up studies in individuals with overt endothelial dysfunction and in offspring from hypertensive patients highlight the prognostic and genetic importance of a reduced nitric oxide bioavailability for the pathophysiology of arterial hypertension.",0,0

Numerous significant randomized controlled trials have been conducted in each of these three categories that may affect management; For primary prevention, the latest information from the Heart Outcomes Prevention Assessment, Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction to Hypertension, the Cognition and Prognosis Study in the Elderly, and the Australian National Blood Pressure Study support the view that lowering blood pressure protects against stroke, regardless of initial blood pressure. pressure level. There is some evidence that blocking the angiotensin system may provide additional protection. For secondary prevention, evidence from the Perindopril Recurrent Stroke Protection Study indicates that lowering blood pressure with perindopril-based therapy reduces the incidence of fatal or non-fatal stroke in either hypertensive or normotensive individuals. Although the presentation of the recent Acute Candesartan Silexetil Assessment in Stroke Survivors study, which provided significant protection against vascular events using candesartan, suggests that further studies are needed, there is uncertainty about blood pressure reduction in acute stroke. Lowering blood pressure for the primary prevention of stroke should be done using various therapeutic agents. Perindopril-based therapy should be used for secondary stroke prevention based on available evidence. There is still uncertainty about whether lowering blood pressure is safe or improves outcomes in the setting of acute stroke.",0,0

To estimate the cost-effectiveness of intravenous treatment with levosimendan compared to dobutamine in patients with severe low-output heart failure; This economic assessment is based on a European clinical trial (LIDO) in which 203 patients with severe heart failure received a random 24-hour infusion of levosimendan or dobutamine. Survival and resource usage data were collected over 6 months; Survival was estimated based on data from the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study, assuming a mean additional life of 3 years. Costs were based on study drug use and hospitalization at 6-month follow-up. A sensitivity analysis of drug dose and survival time was performed; Mean survival over 6 months was 157+/-52 days in the levosimendan group and 139+/-64 days in the dobutamine group (P<0.01). Extrapolating to 3 years, the gain in life expectancy was estimated at 0.35 years (discounted at 3%). Levosimendan increased the average cost per patient by 1108, which was entirely due to the cost of the study drug. The incremental cost per life year saved (LYS) was 3205 at European level; The cost per LYS in individual countries ranged from 3091 to 3331. In the sensitivity analysis, the result was solid; Although patients in the levosimendan group were alive longer and were therefore at risk of longer hospitalization, hospitalization and hospitalization costs did not increase with levosimendan treatment. Cost per LYS using levosimendan compares favorably with other cost-effectiveness analyzes in cardiology.",0,0

This can be improved with drugs such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors that effectively reduce proteinuria; In this longitudinal study, we evaluated the extent to which increasing the ACE inhibitor lisinopril to maximum tolerated doses (median [range]: 30 [10 to 40] mg/day) improved proteinuria and dyslipidemia in 28 patients with nondiabetic chronic nephropathy. Maximum doses of lisinopril significantly and safely reduced proteinuria, serum total, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides without significantly affecting serum HDL and renal hemodynamics. Proteinuria was already reduced at 10 mg/d. Serum lipids decreased gradually and dose-dependently during escalation to maximum doses. Reductions in total and LDL cholesterol correlated with increases in serum albumin/total protein concentration and oncotic pressure, peaked at maximum doses of lisinopril and persisted after treatment discontinuation. Despite less proteinuria reduction, hypercholesterolemia was reduced more (and reflected the increase in serum albumin) in hypoalbuminemic patients than in normoalbuminemic patients who had less reductions in cholesterol and no changes in serum albumin despite greater reductions in proteinuria. Changes in serum triglycerides were independent of changes in serum proteins, strongly correlated with lisinopril doses (r=-0.89, P=0.003) and resolved soon after treatment was discontinued. Lisinopril was well tolerated, did not affect renal hemodynamics and caused symptomatic, reversible hypotension in only two patients; In chronic nephropathies, escalation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor to maximally tolerated doses safely ameliorated hypertriglyceridemia with a direct, dose-dependent effect and hypercholesterolemia through amelioration of the nephrotic syndrome, especially in patients with more severe hypoalbuminemia.",0,0

Losartan 50 mg was administered to the patients for eight weeks. Blood pressure was measured every two weeks throughout the study. Routine laboratory examinations were performed prior to entry into the study, at week four, and at the end of the study. Adverse effects were recorded. After eight weeks, losartan was discontinued and the same patients were administered 10 mg of enalapril per day after a two-week washout period. The same procedure followed for the losartan trial was repeated for the enalapril trial. Losartan treatment resulted in a highly significant reduction in mean diastolic blood pressure while sitting. Comparison with enalapril showed that both drugs were equally effective in lowering blood pressure in mild to moderate hypertension. The percentage of responders was slightly higher with losartan than with enalapril (76.7% versus 86.7%). Side effects reported with losartan were mild. Enalapril, like losartan, was well tolerated, but a high incidence of dry cough was reported in nine patients (30%); Losartan is an effective antihypertensive drug with an excellent safety and tolerability profile. It shows similar blood pressure lowering efficacy as enalapril. Unlike enalapril, losartan does not cause a dry cough.",0,0

Surgery, and now angiographic revascularization procedures, are increasingly popular approaches to the treatment of these patients. Results of randomized, controlled trials suggest that revascularization may not improve survival, but is beneficial in improving symptoms and exercise capacity. However, these trials are of limited value because they do not reflect state-of-the-art revascularization techniques or optimal medical management. Because most of these studies were conducted more than a decade ago, patients were recruited before the survival benefits of antiplatelet therapy, β-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and aggressive lipid lowering were recognized. The Clinical Outcomes Using Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) study should help us determine the best approach for these patients.

1122,12573198,The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system as a target in coronary disease.,,"O'Keefe, James H; Lurk, Jared T; Kahatapitiya, Ravindra C; Haskin, Janet A","The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a fundamental role in the development of atherosclerosis and adverse cardiovascular events. Traditionally, it has been assumed that the pathological effects of RAAS result from vasoconstriction induced by angiotensin II and salt and water retention due to aldosterone. However, these hormones also have potent trophic effects that stimulate increased mass in both the arterial wall and the left ventricle. In addition, angiotensin II and aldosterone predispose to vascular inflammation, thrombosis, oxidative stress, and sudden cardiac death. Treatment for RAAS overactivity is essential to normalize the prognosis of most patients with atherosclerosis. An angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor improves the prognosis of patients with atherosclerosis and/or diabetes, even in the setting of normal baseline blood pressure. Angiotensin receptor blocking agents also improve cardiovascular structure and prognosis. Although these agents are better tolerated than ACE inhibitors, they do not appear to be as effective in reducing event rates. Aldosterone receptor blocking agents also improve cardiovascular structure, function, and prognosis. Aldosterone receptor blockers appear to provide additional benefit when used in combination with an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker.",0,0

We investigated the effects of an extended-release nitrate preparation and 2 angiotensin II (AII) inhibitors (an AII receptor antagonist and an ACE inhibitor) on aortic pulse wave contour and systemic blood pressure in hypertensive subjects with a high magnification index induced by exaggerated blood pressure. pulse wave reflection. Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover studies were conducted in a total of 16 elderly patients with systolic hypertension refractory to conventional antihypertensive therapy. In 1 study, pharmacodynamic responses were determined for single dose placebo, isosorbide mononitrate, eprosartan, and captopril; the other compared a single dose of isosorbide mononitrate and placebo in subjects initially treated with AII inhibitors. Blood pressure was measured by sphygmomanometry, and pulse wave components were measured by applanation tonometry in the radial artery. All 3 agents have been shown to reduce brachial systolic blood pressure, aortic systolic blood pressure, and aortic pulse pressure. The qualitative effects on the aortic pulse wave contour were different: the augmentation index was not significantly altered by captopril or eprosartan, but decreased by approximately 50% of placebo with isosorbide mononitrate in both study groups (P<0.0001). We suggest that isosorbide mononitrate corrects the amplified wave reflection in systolic hypertension of these elderly patients with a different effect than that exerted by acute or chronic AII inhibition.",0,0

A total of 96 centers participated in this randomized, parallel-group, controlled study. A total of 829 patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension were randomized, and 790 were eligible for efficacy analysis (intent to treat). Patients of both sexes, aged 18-75 years, newly diagnosed or untreated in the last month, were included in the study if their diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was > or =95 and < or =114 mmHg.

Responses to volume expansion were measured in eight HTRs (57 +/- 6 years) and six liver transplant recipients (LTR) (52 +/- 2 years) before and after treatment with captopril (225 mg/day). After three days of a standard diet, 0.154 mol/l saline was infused at 8 ml/kg/hr for 4 hours. Blood pressure, hormones and kidney function were monitored for 48 hours. Four months later, the same subjects received captopril (225 mg/day) and the protocol was repeated; Prior to captopril, saline infusion suppressed RAAS in LTRs but not HTRs, resulting in a 50% +/- 11% elimination 48 hours post infusion versus 86% +/-12% of sodium load. Blood pressure increased only at HTRs (+16 +/- 5/9 +/- 3 mm Hg) and remained elevated for 48 hours (p < or = 0.05). After captopril, sodium elimination was comparable in the liver (87% +/- 13%) and heart groups (86 +/- 12%), and blood pressure was not changed in either group. CONCLUSION; Heart transplant recipients have blunted diuretic and natriuretic responses to volume expansion mediated by their inability to suppress the RAAS. Pharmacological suppression of the RAAS normalized the defects in blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. These findings suggest that hypertension in HTRs is due, in part, to failure to reflexively suppress the RAAS when these patients become hypervolemic.",0,0

Therefore, plasma enalaprilat can be markedly increased with conventional dosage. It is not clear whether this overexposure to the drug results in better control of blood pressure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term blood pressure response of enalaprilat to two different plasma levels. The short-term blood pressure response was evaluated as part of an open, randomized, controlled study of the effect of high and low doses of enalapril on the progression of renal failure. Data were analyzed in all patients who completed the 3-month follow-up.

Study design and basic patient characteristics.,,"Zannad, Faiez; Kessler, MichÃ¨le; GrÃ¼nfeld, Jean Pierre; Thuilliez, Christian","The prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is increasing in Western countries. Patients with ESRD are more often elderly and diabetic and suffer very high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The main purpose of the FOSIDIAL study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fosinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, in reducing mortality and cardiovascular events in hemodialysis patients presenting with left ventricular hypertrophy. A total of 397 patients were included in the study. They are between 50-80 years old (mean 66.7 years) and have been receiving hemodialysis treatment for 4.8 years. All had left ventricular hypertrophy with a cardiac mass index >100 g/m2 in women and >130 g/m2 in men, measured within 3 months prior to inclusion. The basic cardiac mass index is 174 g/m2. After a 2-week placebo period, patients were randomized into two groups receiving either fosinopril 5-20 mg daily or placebo for a period of 24 months. The target dose is reached by the sixth, seventh or eighth week of treatment. Based on tolerance, 300 patients reached the maximum recommended dose. Patients are then clinically evaluated every 3 months until the end of the study. The primary outcome is a composite endpoint of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events. Secondary endpoints were individual cardiovascular events, event-free survival, overall mortality, and all-cause hospitalization. The trial began in October 1998. All patients were recruited through December 2000 and follow-up continues. The last visit for the last patient was scheduled for 30 December 2002.

Unfortunately, although heart failure affects men and women equally, women have historically represented a minority in heart failure trials. Despite this disparity, treatment decisions are largely based on these trials. Women with heart failure often have different clinical features from men, such as age of onset and comorbidities. Compared with men, women also differ in remodeling and response to injuries such as volume or pressure overload and myocardial infarction. We are only beginning to understand the clinical implications of these gender differences and their implications for pharmacological treatments.

The benefits of blood pressure lowering therapy for the prevention of fatal and non-fatal strokes in middle-aged individuals are well established. However, until recently, there was uncertainty about the consistency of such benefits among different patient groups, and particularly for older people and those with a history of stroke. This article discusses the evidence surrounding the efficacy of blood pressure lowering therapy, particularly in elderly patients with a history of stroke, with particular attention to the results of the Perindopril Recurrent Stroke Protection Trial (PROGRESS). PROGRESS was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 6105 subjects with a history of cerebrovascular disease from 172 hospital outpatient clinics in ten countries. Participants (mean age 64 years; range 26-91 years) were randomly assigned to receive active treatment with an ACE inhibitor-based blood pressure lowering regimen (perindopril) with or without the diuretic indapamide or matched placebo.

Importantly, the benefits of treatment were consistent across key patient subgroups, including those with and without hypertension, Asian and non-Asian patients, and both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke subtypes. The available evidence is now strong for clinicians to consider blood pressure-lowering therapy to be crucial in stroke prevention, regardless of blood pressure levels, particularly in patients with a known history of cerebrovascular disease (and vascular disease in general). patients are clinically stable after acute stroke or other vascular event. Additional age-specific analyzes of PROGRESS data, together with those from other completed studies, will provide more reliable information on the extent of benefits of blood pressure lowering therapy, particularly for different age groups, and particularly for the oldest (oldest). >80 years).

This study demonstrated that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with both an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACE-I) and an angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) was more effective in type I than either drug alone. Tested whether it was superior or not. diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). A randomized, double-blind crossover study was conducted with 8 weeks of treatment with placebo, benazepril 20 mg once daily, valsartan 80 mg once daily, and a combination of 20 mg benazepril and 80 mg valsartan. Twenty type I diabetes patients with DN were included. Albuminuria, 24-hour BP, and GFR were measured at the end of each treatment period. Eighteen patients completed the study. Placebo values were: albuminuria [mean (95% CI)], 701 (490 to 1002) mg/24 hours; BP [mean (SEM)] is 144 (4)/79 (2) mmHg and GFR [mean (SEM)] is 82 (7) ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Treatment with benazepril, valsartan, or dual blockade significantly reduced albuminuria and blood pressure compared to placebo. Benazepril and valsartan were equally effective. Dual blockade resulted in an additional 43% (29-54%) reduction in albuminuria and 6 (0 to 13) mmHg and 7 (1 to 14) mmHg (benazepril and valsartan) systolic BP compared to either monotherapy and 7 compared to either monotherapy.

Target diastolic blood pressures below 80 mm Hg appear optimal; Systolic targets have not been rigorously evaluated, but targets of 135 mm Hg or less are reasonable. Studies comparing drug classes do not suggest clearly superior agents. However, it is reasonable to conclude that thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, and perhaps angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be the preferred first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension in diabetes. beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are more effective than placebo, but may not be as effective as diuretics, angiotensin-II receptor blockers or ACE inhibitors; however, study results are inconsistent in this regard; Treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetes with blood pressure targets of 135/80 mm Hg provides dramatic benefits.

African American hypertensives are considered a special population with a higher prevalence of hypertension and therefore unique treatment needs. The aim of the study was to review drug use among an African-American and Hispanic urban population according to JNC recommendations. The study population was drawn from a pre-existing cohort of African Americans and Latinos. Records were reviewed for self-diagnosis of hypertension and use of any antihypertensive medication in individuals under 60 years of age. A small subset of individuals were reviewed separately for specific drugs used to treat hypertension. The cohort included 34,118 eligible subjects aged 45+ and younger than 60 years; 40% were African American and 60% Latino. Of the 13,593 African Americans, 6387 (47%) were hypertensive.

In a subgroup of 550 (223 African Americans and 327 Latinos) with detailed drug information, calcium channel blockers and diuretics were the most commonly used drugs among African Americans, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were the most commonly used among Latinos. Beta blockers were used only 13% of the time. The authors concluded that in this cohort of hypertensive urban Latinos and African Americans, more than 40% of individuals were not treated for hypertension, and very few were treated for their hypertension with diuretic monotherapy or beta, despite the guidelines recommended in JNC VI.

We aimed to evaluate the frequency of weight loss in patients with this disease, whether the degree of weight loss predicts mortality and whether weight loss can be prevented with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We investigated weight changes in 1929 patients from the SOLVD study who had chronic heart failure, had no edema at baseline, and survived at least 4 months after trial entry. The mean follow-up was 35 months (SD 13). We analyzed the effect of weight loss at cut-off points of 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 15% (pre) and 6% (post hoc) to determine which predicted the best outcome. To validate the results, we analyzed data from 619 patients in the V-HeFT II trial; 817 patients (42%) in the SOLVD study had a weight loss of 5% or greater from baseline. At 8-month follow-up, all cutoff points for weight loss were significantly associated with impaired survival after adjusting for age, sex, New York Heart Association class, left ventricular ejection fraction, and treatment allocation. Weight loss of 6% or more at any time during follow-up was the strongest predictor of impaired survival (adjusted hazard ratio 2.10, 95% CI 1.77-2.49; p<0.0001). Patients taking the ACE inhibitor enalapril had a 6% or greater lower risk of weight loss than those not taking the drug (adjusted reduction 19%, p=0.0054). The results obtained from the analysis of the V-HeFT II data supported our findings; Weight loss occurs frequently in patients with chronic heart disease, is rarely reversible, and is independently associated with impaired survival when present. Weight loss of more than 6% should be used to define the presence of cachexia in patients with chronic heart failure. In chronic heart failure, treatment with an ACE inhibitor reduces the risk of weight loss.",0,0

In contrast, ARB did not produce a significant reduction in proteinuria at 12 weeks (23 +/- 8%, n = 13), but a 41% +/- 6% reduction in proteinuria was observed at 48 weeks. Similarly, although early (12 weeks) increases in urinary NO(x) excretion were observed with ACE-I (257 +/- 70 to 1111 +/- 160 micromol/day) and ARB (280 +/- 82 to 723) + /- 86 micromol/day), the ARB-induced increase in NO(x) excretion was smaller than that of ACE-I (P < 0.05). In conclusion, although both ACE-I and ARB lower blood pressure similarly, the effect of these agents on proteinuria differs in chronic kidney disease with moderate proteinuria. A relatively early onset of proteinuria-reducing effect was observed with ACE-I, which paralleled the increase in urinary NO(x) excretion. Conversely, ARB reduced proteinuria and gradually increased urinary NO(x) excretion.

We evaluated brachial artery flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent expansion (high-resolution ultrasound) by comparing it to an endothelium-independent response to glyceryl trinitrate (25 microg/s). Brachial artery diameter was measured by automated computerized analysis. Forty healthy individuals were considered as the control group. Oxidative stress production was assessed by measuring plasma malondialdehyde and plasma lipoperoxides; plasma antioxidant capacity was evaluated as iron-reducing antioxidant power. Hypertensive patients showed significantly (P<0.01) lower flow-mediated dilatation (5.2%+/-1.9%) compared to healthy control subjects (7.1+/-2.6). Response to glyceryl trinitrate was similar in control subjects and patients. At baseline, blood pressure, diameter, flow-mediated dilation, and response to glyceryl trinitrate were similar in the different treatment groups. All treatments similarly lowered blood pressure, but only perindopril increased flow-mediated dilatation without altering the glyceryl trinitrate response (5.1+/-2 to 6.4+/-2.4; P<0.01). Perindopril as well as telmisartan nifedipine and amlodipine reduced oxidative stress and increased plasma antioxidant capacity. In patients with essential hypertension, ACE inhibitors appear to be the only compounds that can ameliorate conduit artery endothelial-induced vasodilation.",0,0

Incomplete suppression of the SNS may contribute to residual mortality during optimal ACE inhibitor therapy in CHF. Carvedilol, a mixed alpha and beta blocker with antioxidant properties, and other pure beta-adrenoceptor blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in Caucasians with CHF. However, beta-blocker monotherapy is insufficiently effective in Blacks with essential hypertension or in the treatment of glaucoma. The efficacy of beta-blockers in the treatment of African Americans with congestive heart failure is a controversial issue with conflicting findings. The objectives of this study were to examine and compare the cardiovascular, autonomic, and clinical effects of additional alpha-1 or beta-1 blockade treated with an ACE-inhibitor in Black patients with moderate to severe CHF; Twenty-eight Nigerian patients with chronic CHF stabilized on digoxin and diuretics were randomized into 3 groups with similar demographics according to a single-blind, parallel-group design. The patients were 53 +/- 6 years old, with a mean cardiothoracic ratio of 0.66 +/-0.03 and an ejection fraction of 0.38 +/- 0.10%, consisting of 14 men and 14 women with a 60% hypertensive etiology. Group 1 patients received 5 mg enalapril alone, group 2 received 5 mg enalapril + 1 mg prazosin, and group 3 received 5 mg enalapril + 50 mg atenolol. All drugs were taken daily for 4 weeks. Blood pressure, heart rate, pressure velocity product, 6-minute walk test, NYHA class, and cardiac autonomic reflexes were measured at baseline and at 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA and one-way ANOVA were used in data analysis; The 3 treatments resulted in significant (P<.001 ANOVA) and similar improvements for the NYHA class (-1.0 to -1.6) and increased the 6-minute distance traveled (from +130m to +205m). Although no treatment difference was observed, a trend appeared suggesting a greater improvement with enalapril + atenolol. At week four, sympathoplegic treatments, enalapril + atenolol and enalapril + prazosin, in pressure ratio product (-3726 +/- 1885 mm Hg x beats/min; -3498 +/- 396 mm Hg beats/(respectively min), (enalapril alone) During the Valsalva maneuver, phase IV bradycardia was significantly higher (944 +/- 66 ms) after treatment with enalapril + atenolol compared with (-1349 +/- 894 mm Hg x beats/min) (P<.001 ANOVA) or enalapril + was similar between prazosin (825 +/- 48 ms) vs. enalapril alone (760 +/- 45 ms) (P<.001 ANOVA) Phase II Valsalva tachycardia The rate of respiratory sinus arrhythmia was significantly increased (P<. 005 ANOVA) and equally across all treatments. However, the pressure and chronotropic responses to forearm isometric grip were significantly increased (P<.02) in the enalapril + prazosin combination compared to other treatments. Our findings did not demonstrate the safety of providing additional treatment alone. l Co-inhibition of ACE in Blacks with CHF alpha-1 or b Treatment with ta-1 receptor blockade, concomitant improvement in exercise tolerance and NYHA class. Compared with using ACE inhibition alone, the combined treatments resulted in a significant reduction in the pressure ratio product, an index of myocardial oxygen consumption, and a greater increase in cardiac parasympathetic activity. Selective beta-1 blockade resulted in greater increases in central baroreceptor vagal activity compared to alpha-1 blockade. Conversely, suppressive and chronotropic abnormalities during forearm isometric grip in CHF were normalized with alpha-1 but not beta-1 blockade. Therefore, the hemodynamic effects of combined reflex cardiac vagal enhancement and alpha-1 antagonism with concomitant ACE inhibition following selective beta-1 blockade may provide major therapeutic and prognostic benefit in Blacks with non-ischemic (hypertensive) CHF stabilized on digoxin. and diuretics.",0,0

The main goal of treating high blood pressure in this population is to prevent or reduce the likelihood of target organ damage. Therefore, the treatment goal for hypertension should be defined based on optimal means of preventing cardiovascular and renal events. Reducing high blood pressure with pharmacological treatment is associated with reduced cardiovascular events, kidney disease, and associated mortality. However, many questions remained. Some of the basic and important questions are: What should be the purpose of blood pressure treated in diabetics and are there agents of choice for use in the hypertensive diabetic population? How do angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers fit? Does one class have advantages over the other? The purpose of this review is to summarize recent clinical research findings and attempt to offer evidence-based recommendations to help the clinician better select blood pressure targets and treatment strategies in the diabetic population.",0,0

Joint National Committee VI recommendation is below 130/85 mm Hg for target blood pressure in diabetics – a more aggressive target than in non-diabetic patients. Data over the past decade support these aggressive targets, particularly for cardiovascular and renal outcomes and overall mortality. Additionally, in diabetics, blood pressure appears to be a persistent risk factor for these outcomes without evidence of a J-point effect. While these goals are rarely achieved in diabetic patients, studies show that they can be achieved with attention to detail and the use of multiple antihypertensive agents.",0,0

LV size, short-axis muscle (mass) area (LVMA), and function were measured from 2D echocardiograms. The prevalence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and frequent ventricular ectopia (premature ventricular contractions [PVCs] >10/hr) was evaluated from ambulatory ECG. VT and .10/hr PVCs occurred in 20% and 29% of patients at baseline, 22% and 35% at 1 year, and 23% and 39% at 2 years. VT and PVCs were significantly associated with LV size, LVMA, and function at baseline and >10/hr at 1 and 2 years. Also, changes in LV size and function from baseline to 2 years predicted both VT and PVCs >10/hr. The study was insufficient to detect the treatment effect of ACE inhibitors and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, but did not alter the relationships between ventricular arrhythmias, LV size and function; Quantitative echocardiographic assessment of LV size, LVMA, and function and changes in these measurements over time predict post-infarct ventricular arrhythmias.

Certain high-risk situations are compelling indications for the initial use of other classes of antihypertensive drugs (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers); (5) Most patients with hypertension will require 2 or more antihypertensive drugs to achieve target BP (<140/90 mm Hg or <130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease); (6) If BP is 20/10 mm Hg above target BP, initiation of treatment with 2 agents, 1 of which should usually be a thiazide-type diuretic, should be considered; and (7) The most effective treatment prescribed by the most attentive clinician will control hypertension only if patients are motivated.

Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes. Control of cardiovascular disease risk factors is achieved in only a minority of patients. Given the magnitude of the problem and the severity of diabetes complications, prevention seems like a logical approach to curb the increasing prevalence of the disease. Interventions such as lifestyle changes and the use of metformin and acarbose have been demonstrated in randomized prospective trials to prevent diabetes in high-risk patients. Other interventions are currently being studied in large prospective studies. One or more of these approaches is likely to make diabetes prevention a reality in the near future.",0,0

Recent experimental studies have demonstrated electrical and structural atrial remodeling with increased fibrosis in animals with HF and suggested that ACE inhibitors (ACEi) have an inhibitory effect on the development of AF. To confirm the hypothesis that ACEi prevents the development of AF in patients with heart failure, we performed a retrospective analysis of patients enrolled in the Left Ventricular Dysfunction Studies (SOLVD) from the Montreal Heart Institute (MHI); Clinical pictures were reviewed and serial ECGs interpreted by a single cardiologist blinded to drug allocation. Patients with AF or palpitations on the baseline ECG were excluded from the study. Key features were obtained from SOLVD databases. The mean follow-up was 2.9+/-1.0 years. Of 391 randomly assigned patients at MHI, 374 were in sinus rhythm at randomization, and 186 received enalapril and 188 placebo. Baseline features were similar in the two groups, except that the incidence of prior myocardial infarction was higher in the enalapril group. Fifty-five patients had AF at follow-up: 10 (5.4%) in the enalapril group and 45 (24%) in the placebo group (P<0.0001). Based on Cox multivariate analysis, enalapril was the strongest predictor of AF risk reduction (hazard ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.44; P<0.0001); Treatment with the ACEi enalapril markedly reduces the risk of developing atrial fibrillation in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.",0,0
1189,12779302,Pharmacotherapy for heart failure in patients with renal failure.,,"Shlipak, Michael G","Clinical trials have shown that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers and spironolactone improve survival in patients with heart failure. Because patients with heart failure and renal failure were underrepresented in these studies, little evidence is available to guide clinicians in the optimal management of patients with both conditions. About one-third to half of patients with heart failure have kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and renal failure is among the strongest predictors of mortality in patients with heart failure. Evidence supports the use of ACE inhibitors to improve survival in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR, 30 to 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), but there is little evidence to weigh the risks and benefits in patients with more advanced renal dysfunction. . beta-blockers improve survival in patients with heart failure and their beneficial effects are unlikely to differ with renal function. Spironolactone improves outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure, but renal failure appears to increase the risk of hyperkalemia and limit the use of the drug in patients with severe renal impairment. Future clinical trials on heart failure should include a representative number of patients with renal impairment to improve the evidence base and outcomes in this sensitive population.",0,0

Patients were randomized in a stratified design to receive initial therapy with enalapril or nisoldipine and targets for intensive or moderate therapy. We measured an electrocardiographic index, adjusted Cornell voltage for increased left ventricular mass, serially by treatment group. The relationship between changes in electrocardiographic voltage and cardiovascular events was defined by Cox proportional hazard analysis; At 5-year follow-up, the decrease in adjusted Cornell voltage was significantly greater in enalapril-treated patients than in nisoldipine-treated patients (repeated measures analysis of variance P = .002). In the Cox proportional hazards model, treatment assignment (enalapril and nisoldipine) was the strongest predictor of cardiovascular events, but the presence of coronary disease at baseline, duration of diabetes mellitus, and change in voltage were also independent predictors of cardiovascular events; In the ABCD study, treatment with enalapril was associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction.

The direct response cost was calculated from the contact time (planned and unscheduled) spent by the MDC team. Unplanned hospitalization costs for HF were calculated at a daily rate of 242. Results were determined in monetary terms, ie cost of service per hospitalization avoided and net cost/savings in 3 months; The MDC team's direct response cost was 5860, with an average cost per patient of 113 (95% CI: 97-128). At 3 months, there were a total of 12 unplanned HF readmissions (25.5% rate, 195 days) in the RC group compared with 2 (3.9% rate, 17 days) in the MDC group. The number of times required to be treated to prevent a hospitalization for HF was 6 in 3 months. The cost of blocked service per hospital stay was 586. The intervention resulted in a net cost savings of 37,216 for 51 patients treated for 3 months. Sensitivity analyzes using 50% variation in costs and lower relative risk reductions confirmed the cost-benefits of the intervention; HF's MDC remains cost-beneficial when combined with optimal medical care. The significant clinical and cost-benefits demonstrate that this intensive approach to MDC and medical management should become the standard of care for HF.",0,0

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) provides effective BP reduction and kidney protection in hypertensive diabetic patients. However, achieving recommended BP levels may be difficult, and dual-blockade therapy may be a possible way to achieve effective BP reduction in hypertensive patients with diabetes. Dual blockade therapy is based on the principle of achieving the broadest and most effective blockade of angiotensin II using a combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB; The Candesartan and Lisinopril Microalbuminuria (CALM II) study was a single-center, single-observer, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group study investigating the efficacy and tolerability of candesartan cilexetil in combination with lisinopril compared to maximal.

Studies have shown that insulin resistance precedes the development of hypertension. By improving insulin sensitivity, it may be possible to ameliorate hypertension and consequent damage to vessel walls. Some data indicate beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on insulin sensitivity and endothelial function. We aimed to investigate these effects of ACE inhibition in the same patient group with essential hypertension; Nine non-smoker, untreated hypertensive patients (38.3+9 years, 4/5 men/women) and 12 healthy individuals of the same age (35.2+6.7 years, 5/7 men/women) were included in the study. Hypertensive patients were given enalapril maleate (5 40 mg/day) for six months. The following parameters were examined at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured with a formula derived from the oral glucose tolerance test, called the insulin sensitivity index (ISI). Insulin was measured by chemiluminescence and glucose by a glucose oxidase method. Endothelial function was assessed by ultrasonography as flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery and expressed as percent change from baseline diameter. Endothelial-independent vasodilation was measured after sublingual nitroglycerin; Compared with healthy subjects, FMD was impaired in the hypertensive group (7.3+3.1 vs. 15.3+4.8%, p<0.0005) and ISI values were 1.18+0.6 vs. 4.4, respectively. +0.9 (p<0.0001).

We used I1-imidazoline receptor or alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists to evaluate the function of these receptors in the caudal ventrolateral medulla in controlling the cardiovascular effects of clonidine in male Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with urethane. Unilateral microinjection of clonidine (6 nmol/50 nl) into the caudal ventrolateral medulla significantly increased blood pressure and discharge of presympathetic neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, while heart rate did not change. Microinjection of yohimbine (a selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, 500 pmol/50 nl) into the caudal ventrolateral medulla did not alter blood pressure, heart rate, or discharge of rostral ventrolateral medulla presympathetic neurons and failed to reduce local caudal ventrolateral. medulla clonidine-induced blood pressure elevation. However, unilateral microinjection of idazoxane (a mixed antagonist of the imidazoline receptor and alpha2-adrenoceptor, 2 nmol/50 nl) into the caudal ventrolateral medulla significantly decreased mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and discharge of rostral ventrolateral medulla presympathetic neurons and completely eliminated the suppressive effect of clonidine.

A pilot study was designed to examine the effects of captopril on these exercise-related variables in COPD patients categorized by ACE gene polymorphisms. Thirty-six patients with COPD (II=13, ID=11, DD=12) received oral captopril (25 mg) or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion and underwent right heart catheterization with exercise. With both placebo and captopril, post-exercise mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and lactate concentration were higher in patients with DD genotype than in patients with II or ID genotype. In contrast, mixed venous oxygen pressure (PvO(2)) was lower in patients with the DD genotype than in patients with the other genotype.

In patients with the II genotype, post-exercise PvO(2) was higher with captopril than with placebo, but not in those with other genotypes; These findings show that pulmonary hemodynamic variables and tissue oxygenation status during exercise depend on ACE genotypes, and captopril administration effectively affects these exercise-related variables.

In some studies, the effect of blood pressure (BP) - reducing effect may also contribute to this inconsistency. To examine the possibility of differential benefit with respect to underlying kidney diseases, we conducted a cross-therapeutic trial of combination therapy in two selected homogeneous groups of patients with diabetic and non-diabetic kidney diseases. The blood pressure lowering effect was excluded during the study. Nineteen biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy and 24 type 2 diabetic nephropathy patients were selected as study subjects as examples of non-diabetic kidney diseases. Subjects had to meet the following criteria: a creatinine clearance (Ccr) of 25 to 90 ml/min/1.73 m2, 24-hour urinary protein excretion rate above 1.0 g/day and BP below 130/80 mmHg, more than six months of ramipril therapy with (5.7 +/- 0.4 mg/day, 13 +/- 2 months). Baseline data between the two groups did not differ significantly. After a 12-week stabilization period (control period), a once-daily dose of 4 mg candesartan (combination period) followed by a placebo (placebo period) or vice versa was administered in addition to ramipril for 12 weeks. Combination with candesartan did not alter Ccr, BP, serum and urinary electrolytes or urea. The 24-hour urinary protein excretion rate was significantly reduced with combination therapy in patients with IgA nephropathy (3.1 +/- 0.3 g/day in combination, 4.2 +/- 0.3 in control and 4.3 +/- 0.2 in placebo; p < 0.05).

Changes in proteinuria showed no association with changes in BP in IgA nephropathy. In conclusion, during the 12-week trial, the benefit of the antiproteinuric effect of the combination therapy was different between IgA and diabetic nephropathy. The difference in the pathophysiological role and importance of the renin-angiotensin system between the two diseases may contribute to the difference in outcome. We propose that distinguishing underlying kidney diseases in study subjects is an important prerequisite for future studies in this regard.",0,0

The pathogenesis of LVH is complex. In addition to hemodynamic load (pressure or volume overload) and demographic factors, various trophic humoral factors such as angiotensin II, aldosterone, endothelin, leptin, and catecholamines may also contribute to the development and progression of LVH. Effective antihypertensive therapy can reverse LVH and prevent its development. Regression of LVH reduces subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Commonly used drugs have various effects on LVH. Angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors appear to be most effective.

1207,12844467,Lessons from experiments in patients with hypertensive type 2 diabetes.,,"Ruilope, Luis M","There is undeniable evidence that the association of type 2 diabetes with hypertension significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular events, death, and nephropathy. In type 2 diabetes, even blood pressure values that are generally considered below the threshold for hypertension (ie 140/90 mm Hg) in non-diabetic persons represent an additional risk of clinical relevance. There is also overwhelming evidence that more intense blood pressure lowering is more beneficial than less intense lowering in type 2 diabetes. However, most published studies show the need for combination therapy in the vast majority of patients, and it is difficult to achieve the expected target blood pressure, especially target systolic blood pressure, even with combination therapy. It should be accepted that the systolic blood pressure target below 130 mm Hg is very difficult to achieve in diabetics. Evidence of superiority or inferiority of different classes of drugs is unclear and contradictory. Recent evidence for angiotensin II receptor antagonists has shown a significant reduction in cardiovascular events, cardiovascular death and overall mortality compared with losartan atenolol, but not when compared with irbesartan amlodipine. Considering the renal endpoints, the evidence for the benefit of angiotensin II receptor antagonists in type 2 diabetes is more robust than with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Primary prevention of the development of microalbuminuria appears to be greatly facilitated by tight blood pressure control. However, better maintenance of glomerular filtration rate by achieving normal blood pressure levels (< 130/80 mm Hg) does not appear to be warranted.",0,0

There is currently little sustained evidence for pressure-independent advantages for any class of drugs. Therefore, combining these findings with additional information on aspirin and statin use in addition to targeted blood pressure and safety levels, we can formulate healthcare policies that attack hypertension in a holistic risk-based manner. The future will focus on providing extra benefit for patients by testing the efficacy and superiority of drug combinations using new agents that positively affect intermediate markers such as arterial stiffness, and by stopping the increasing burden of cognitive impairment and dementia.",0,0
1209,12844471,Recent clinical trials with Omapatrilat: new developments.,,"Zanchi, Anne; Maillard, Marc; Burnier, Michel","Omapatrilat belongs to vasopeptidase inhibitors, that is, drugs that have the ability to simultaneously inhibit membrane-bound zinc metalloproteases, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11 (NEP). Omapatrilat aimed to treat patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. The preclinical and early clinical studies conducted with Omapatrilat were very promising. Indeed, omapatrilat appeared to be a very potent antihypertensive agent with very positive effects on cardiac function in heart failure patients. In contrast to these early studies, large clinical trials have been more disappointing. The results of the OCTAVE study confirmed the antihypertensive efficacy of omapatrilat, but at an angioedema price three times higher (2.17% versus 0.68%) than an ACE inhibitor in the general population and nearly four times higher at an angioedema price. black population. In OVERTURE, a large randomized control trial in heart failure, angioedema was also more common with omapatrilat, but the incidence was much lower (0.8% with omapatrilat and 0.5% with enalapril). However, omapatrilat was not convincingly superior to the ACE inhibitor. Because angioedema is likely a class of adverse effects of vasopeptidase inhibitors, the higher incidence of this potentially life-threatening complication with omapatrilat likely halted development of this new class of agents. The future of vasopeptidase inhibitors will depend on their ability to improve the risk/benefit ratio, either by developing agents that produce less angioedema or by more precisely identifying a high-risk population that could benefit from dual ACE/NEP inhibition.",0,0

However, there is controversy regarding their efficacy in patients with small infarcts and preserved LV systolic function. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of ACE-I perindopril on global LV performance in patients with pure inferior AMI (AMI-I) using a Doppler-derived index (DI) combining systolic and diastolic time intervals (Tei index). Our study included 40 patients with initial AMI-I, mean age 60 years +/- 9.06 years (SD), and 24 age- and sex-matched normal patients, constituting the control group (COG). Patients were randomized into two groups to receive either conventional AMI-I (GCT) therapy or the above therapy plus P (GP) therapy. Full Doppler echocardiography (systolic and diastolic parameters), DI and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were measured at 8.07 +/- 1.16(SD) days post-infarction. The same review was done for the COG. DI was significant in healthy patients (0.45 +/- 0.23) compared to the value in patients with GP (0.56 +/- 0.03; P = 0.023) or GCT (0.78 +/- 0.05; P = 0.000). was substantially lower. In addition, DI was higher in GHT patients compared to GP (P = 0.000). In addition, administration of perindopril decreased isovolumic relaxation time (IRT; 120.00 +/- 4.23 vs. 139.00 +/- 6.74; P = 0.006) and significantly increased ejection time (ET;274.25 +/- 7.35 versus 253.50 +/- 7.68; P = 0.042). SBP in GP patients was similar to that of GCT (120.5 +/- 2.85 mmHg and 112.5 +/- 3.49 mmHg; P = NS); Global LV function (DI) is impaired in patients with AMI-I. Administration of perindopril has a positive effect on LV performance in AMI-I patients, achieved through improvement of diastolic function (IRT) and indirectly improving LV systolic function (ET, DI). This beneficial effect of Perindopril is the result of direct tissue action, not the hemodynamic effect of the drug.",0,0

The target blood pressure was 135/85 mm Hg or less. The rate of decrease in residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the development of complete anuria were compared between the groups. Over 12 months, mean residual GFR decreased by 2.07 mL/min per 1.73 m2 in the ramipril group versus 3.00 mL/min per 1.73 m2 in the control group (P = 0.03).

Aldosterone has been overlooked as a mediator of RAAS escape and a key factor in target organ damage, despite the use of existing RAAS blockers. Aldosterone is thought to play a role in the development of hypertension, changes in vascular structure, vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction, structural kidney damage, proteinuria, left ventricular remodeling, collagen synthesis and myocardial fibrosis. Aldosterone receptor antagonists have been shown to antagonize all these effects in experimental models. Clinical trials with aldosterone antagonists have shown an improvement in survival and left ventricular mass index in patients with congestive heart failure, and a reduction in urinary protein excretion and left ventricular mass index in patients with type 2 diabetes and early nephropathy who develop aldosterone synthesis escape. Consequently, aldosterone receptor antagonists may have specific benefits for reducing target organ damage, especially if there is evidence of RAAS escape.",0,0

Recent landmark clinical trials have demonstrated their important role as primary therapy for the prevention of kidney disease in diabetes. The optimal dose of these RAS blockers required to slow progression of kidney disease or impair cardiovascular risk development is unknown. However, data from multiple studies strongly support the use of higher doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs to reduce proteinuria. All studies of kidney disease progression show the benefit of slowing down when blood pressure is lowered only when higher doses are used. To obtain optimum benefit from ACE inhibitors and ARBs, the dose-response relationship for diabetic kidney disease will need to be determined.

Using clinical trial data from patients with severe congestive heart failure, we show how to predict survival beyond discontinuation of an RCT based on parametric survival models. In the analysis, we compare the estimated survival of different survival models and the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to real survival/ICER. Our main finding is that the results are sensitive to survival model selection and a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is required in CE analysis.",0,0
1232,12963858,Treatment of hypertension in elderly patients: an updated view on the role of calcium antagonists.,,"Kostis, John B","Hypertension is common in adults age 60 and older. Apart from age, hypertension is the strongest predictor of cardiovascular end-organ damage and associated morbidity and mortality. Although diastolic blood pressure has been seen as an important risk factor, it is now clear that systolic blood pressure, which is common especially in older adults, is a better predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Less than 30% of hypertensive patients have blood pressure levels controlled at <140/90 mm Hg as recommended by current guidelines. Controlled trials have shown the benefits of lowering blood pressure for all hypertensive individuals, including those aged 65 and over. Calcium antagonists of the dihydropyridine subclass, which includes nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine, and nitrendipine, as well as other drug classes, are potent antihypertensive agents that may be suitable for the treatment of hypertension in older adults. However, as with all antihypertensive agents, side effects may limit their use; peripheral edema is particularly troublesome for dihydropyridines. Newer dihydropyridine calcium antagonists expected to be approved for use soon, including lercanidipine and lacidipine, have been associated with comparable efficacy to currently available calcium antagonists but with a lower incidence of adverse effects, particularly ankle edema. Antihypertensive agents with improved tolerability profiles offer the potential for improved blood pressure control.",0,0

Of the patients, 16 were male, 6 were female, age 45 +/- 13, duration of diabetes 19 +/- 11 years, insulin dose 38 +/- 11 U/day, 10 normotensive and 12 hypertensive. After a 3-month run-in period, patients were assigned to treatment with enalapril 5 mg or 10 mg, depending on the presence of normotension or hypertension, respectively. Renal function was assessed before and after 6 months of treatment by evaluating glomerular filtration rate (99m Tc-DTPA), renal plasma flow (131-I iodohippurate), filtration fraction, and renal vascular resistance. Mean arterial pressure, albumin excretion rate, urinary urea excretion and glycosylated hemoglobin were also determined. Enalapril administration resulted in a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure, albumin excretion rate, glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction, and renal vascular resistance in both patient groups. Decreased albumin excretion was not correlated with a decrease in systemic blood pressure or filtration fraction. No significant changes in renal plasma flow, urinary urea excretion or glycosylated hemoglobin were observed; Our results show that low doses of enalapril are effective in affecting renal hemodynamics and reducing urinary albumin excretion in both normotensive and hypertensive type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients with initial or overt nephropathy. The lowering effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor on albuminuria appears independent of the effect on systemic blood pressure and renal hemodynamic changes.",0,0

1235,1345141,Hypertensive retinal vascular changes: relationship to left ventricular hypertrophy and arteriolar changes before and after treatment.,,"DahlÃ¶f, B; Stenkula, S; Hansson, L","Eye-to-floor photographs were taken in twenty-eight previously untreated men with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The same eye was evaluated before and after 26 weeks of double-blind treatment with Enalapril or Hydrochlorothiazide. Vascular changes were assessed using a more detailed and refined rating from the Keith-Wagener-Barker scale. All photographs were reviewed by the same observer without knowledge of blood pressure, type of treatment, or order of photographs. In the untreated condition, there were significant positive correlations between vascular changes in the retina and left ventricular wall thickness (echocardiography), minimal vascular resistance in the calf (plethysmography), and blood pressure. Treatment with enalapril significantly reduced the reflection of the retinal artery wall and significantly reduced the narrowing of the arteries and the phenomenon of arterio-venous passage. Hydrochlorothiazide did not affect any of the retinal vascular changes. It can be concluded that this relatively simple technique for assessing eye-locus-photographs with a new rating scale, when used in non-malignant hypertension, provides a useful assessment of the degree of hypertensive target organ damage in the retina, as in any other. important target organs, namely the heart and vascular beds. In addition, Enalapril positively affects hypertensive retinopathy, unlike Hydrochlorothiazide, reflecting what happens to structural cardiovascular changes in the rest of the body.",0,0

Subjects were classified according to Swedish standard criteria. Ambulatory blood pressure (amb-BP) was recorded in a random sample of normotensives and borderline hypertensives, as well as all untreated hypertensives identified at screening and willing to participate. A subset of borderline hypertensives performed their own blood pressure measurements (self blood pressure) both at work and at home. The blood pressure lowering efficacy of atenolol 50 mg daily and enalapril 20 mg daily was compared in hypertensives at rest, over 24 hours, and during dynamic and isometric exercise. The efficacy of enalapril and lisinopril (two ACE inhibitors with different durations of action) was also compared, with a particular focus on the early morning hours; Men and women classified as normotensive were also clearly different from those with hypertension when their blood pressure was recorded by ambulatory technique. The number of correctly classified subjects did not differ between self-BP and office-BP; By combining the two smaller ones added. While atenolol lowered blood pressure better than enalapril during dynamic exercise, there was no significant difference in efficacy between enalapril and lisinopril even 18-24 hours after dosing; More comprehensive blood pressure measurements should be considered in the evaluation of hypertension treatment.

Effect. Predetermined strict criteria were applied. The effect of different drugs in monotherapy and especially in first-line antihypertensive treatments was compared using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers, and calcium antagonists all reduced left ventricular mass (LVM) through a reduction in wall hypertrophy, the effect was most pronounced with ACE-inhibitors. Conversely, diuretics reduced LVM mainly by reducing left ventricular volume. Men with non-malignant essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >95 mmHg 3-4 times on placebo (triple replicates)), previously untreated (n = 28. 86 kg, 46 years, 27 kg/m2) were randomized to : long-term double-blind treatment with enalapril (E) or hydrochlorothiazide (H). There was no significant difference between groups at baseline. Vascular changes in the retina (under-eye photograph, improved grading), cardiac morphology (M-mode echocardiography, ASE), structural vascular changes of the hand (plethysmography, minimal resistance (Rmin)), total peripheral resistance ((TPR), calculated from dye dilution ) and blood pressure (intra-arterial) were significantly correlated at baseline, except for LVM and Rmin. After 6 months of treatment, E decreased signs of vascular changes in the retina as well as Rmin in the hand circulation, while H did not alter or increase these structural vascular changes. The blood pressure lowering effect of E (mainly through lowering of TPR) tended to be more pronounced than that seen with H (mainly via lowering of cardiac output), measured both intraarterially and indirectly, but there was no significant difference. LVM gradually decreased with E, while the effect of H was not significant. E reduced wall thickness, but not left ventricular diameter, and also significantly improved left ventricular elasticity. The effect on cardiac morphology was significantly different between treatments when the change in blood pressure was taken into account. After the longest monotherapy follow-up (18 months), E reduced LVM by 2.7 g/mmHg and H (14 months) by 1.3 g/mmHg (significant for E only). In univariate analysis, changes in cardiovascular structure were significantly associated with changes in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS).",0,0

Insulin sensitivity was assessed with a modified insulin suppression test. Blood pressure (BP), insulin sensitivity, and serum lipoprotein concentrations were compared before and after each treatment and between the two treated groups. BP was significantly and comparably reduced (p < or = 0.01) during treatment with enalapril and atenolol. Insulin sensitivity increased by 15% (p = 0.03) in the enalapril group and worsened by 17% (p < or = 0.01) in the atenolol group. Serum lipoprotein concentrations were not altered by any treatment. Although the improvement in insulin sensitivity caused by enalapril treatment seems to be an advantage compared to atenolol treatment in hypertensive obese and dyslipidemic patients, the BP-lowering efficacy of the two drugs is similar.

Symptoms and physical findings may be helpful in diagnosis, but have limited sensitivity and specificity. Objective measurement of ventricular function is essential in almost all patients with a suspected diagnosis of heart failure. Reversible causes of heart failure should be investigated. Outpatient management includes education and counselling, emphasis and evaluation of dietary adherence, and pharmacological therapy. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are the mainstay of therapy but are underutilized and apparently not given maximum doses due to concerns of side effects. Diuretic therapy should only be administered as needed to manage fluid overload. Calcium channel blockers are relatively contraindicated in patients with impaired ventricular function. Patient follow-up should be guided by the medical history and physical examination results. Routine serial testing of ventricular function and exercise performance is not recommended.",0,0

Blood samples were drawn at baseline and at 2, 60, and 120 days after starting treatment with enalapril. At day 60, there was a significant decrease in mean hemoglobin concentration (mean decrease of 7.4 g/l) that persisted through day 120. Alongside a small but significant decrease by day 2, the mean plasma EPO concentration remained constant throughout the study. However, the magnitude of the decrease in hemoglobin concentration was significantly correlated with baseline plasma creatinine concentration and creatinine clearance.

Inhibition on (ACE) glucose and lipid metabolism. A 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) was performed and plasma glucose and insulin levels, as well as total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglyceride levels were determined before and after 8-12 years of age. -week treatment. Small differences in blood pressure (BP) lowering effect and metabolic response were obtained with the ACE inhibitors studied; only lisinopril significantly improved glucose tolerance; blood lipids were not altered by any drug. The entire patient population showed only a slight reduction in 1-hour post-load glucose after treatment. However, a more significant improvement in glucose tolerance was seen in glucose-intolerant and/or insulin-resistant hypertensive patients (GI/IR, 53.8% of all). This subgroup also showed a slight but not significant increase in HDL-cholesterol and a decrease in triglyceride levels. In hypertensive patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and insulin sensitivity, only slight or no changes were seen in plasma glucose, insulin and lipid values. These positive effects were expressed only after ACE inhibitor monotherapy, but not when hydrochlorothiazide was added. The results suggest that failure to classify hypertensive patients with respect to glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity may be a confusing factor in evaluating the metabolic effects of ACE inhibitors.",0,0

Relatively low doses of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are now routinely used in ischemic heart disease, the leading cause of heart failure. Therefore, we investigated the hemodynamic interaction between ASA and captopril in heart failure. In a randomized, crossover study, 13 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) currently on maintenance therapy with an ACE inhibitor received a single dose of 25 mg of captopril in combination with 236 mg of ASA or placebo. Peripheral blood flow was examined noninvasively by venous occlusion plethysmography of calves. Liver blood flow was estimated from indocyanine green (ICG) clearance. Administration of captopril alone significantly reduced blood pressure (BP) and ICG clearance. Calf blood flow remained unchanged. However, hyperemic calf blood flow continued for a longer time after arterial occlusion. Captopril alone did not significantly alter the plasma levels of the vasodilator prostaglandins PGI2 and PGE2 or the vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2 (TXA2). In contrast, captopril combined with ASA reduced plasma levels of these vasoactive substances with significant reductions in PGE2 and TXA2 compared to captopril alone, but the hemodynamic changes after captopril plus ASA were similar to those observed after captopril alone. In 13 patients with CHF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV] on chronic therapy with ACE inhibitors, a single dose of antithrombotic ASA (236 mg) had no discernible effect on hemodynamic status.",0,0

Study of Lipids with Isoptin Press.,,"Libretti, A; Catalano, M","Some antihypertensive drugs adversely affect the plasma lipid profile and this should be taken into account when selecting treatment for hypertension, as it may offset the beneficial blood pressure lowering effect of these agents. This study investigated the long-term effects of verapamil sustained-release (SR) 240 mg daily and enalapril 20 mg daily on plasma lipid levels in 931 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Patients whose blood pressure was not effectively lowered after at least 1 month of monotherapy received either enalapril 20 mg once daily to their verapamil treatment or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once daily to their enalapril treatment. Blood pressure and lipid profile were evaluated before and after 6 months of treatment. Of 864 evaluable patients, 563 (65.1%) were successfully treated with monotherapy, and 220 (25.5%) required combination therapy. A total of 81 patients withdrew from the trial. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced with treatment with either verapamil or enalapril, and heart rate was slightly but significantly reduced with both treatments. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein were significantly reduced with both treatments. High-density lipoprotein levels were significantly increased in verapamil recipients but not in enalapril recipients. Side effects occurred in 37 (3.9%) patients receiving verapamil SR and 25 (2.7%) patients receiving enalapril. In conclusion, long-term treatment with the antihypertensive agents verapamil and enalapril alone or in combination regimens significantly improved the plasma lipid profile.

1275,7512487,"Lowering blood pressure. How far, how fast?",,"Roca-Cusachs, A","There is a general consensus that high blood pressure (BP) should be lowered gradually. A decrease in BP beyond the limits of the autoregulation curve may compromise the perfusion of vital organs, resulting in organ ischemia. However, a reduction in high BP provides protection against cerebral events and some protection against coronary heart disease. The limited protection against coronary heart disease by lowering BP can be explained in part by what has been called the ""J-shaped curve"": a drop in diastolic blood pressure below 85 mmHg can lead to a paradoxical increase in coronary events, although this effect is small. It is by no means well established. Also, the incidence of various cardiovascular disease-related events peaks in the morning hours, at a time when some antihypertensive drugs are least effective. This may also explain the limited coronary protection achieved after administration of antihypertensive drugs.",0,0

Although there was no change in the frequency of arrhythmias in the placebo group, there was a significant reduction in the frequency of paired early ventricular complexes, bigemine VPS, and ventricular tachycardia in patients treated with enalapril. In addition, it was observed that six cases of atrial fibrillation returned to sinus rhythm. During treatment with enalapril, some patients had increased serum potassium levels, but no changes in serum digoxin levels. We also observed echocardiographic improvement in left ventricular function as well as clinical symptoms of congestive heart failure. Finally, we observed that enalapril has an antiarrhythmic effect in congestive heart failure. We thought that the antiarrhythmic effect of enalapril in congestive heart failure was probably due to hemodynamic improvement.",0,0

1280,7516858,Clinical potential of renin inhibitors and angiotensin antagonists.,,"Cody, R J","The renin-angiotensin system makes an important contribution to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure and hypertension. Therefore, attempts to specifically block this system have been a pharmacological target for over 25 years. Blocking of the renin system was attempted at 3 key sites: the rate-limiting angiotensinogen-renin stage, the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and the active receptor sites for the terminal products of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Converting enzyme inhibitors have been studied and used successfully in clinical cardiovascular disorders, but questions remain regarding the specificity of their effects. Therefore, other more specific approaches are still under evaluation. Inhibition of the effect of renin on angiotensinogen has been demonstrated in experimental studies with early inhibitory peptides and specific antibodies. Most of the currently available renin inhibitors are non-peptide, which nevertheless require intravenous administration. An oral renin inhibitor with clinical effects has been evaluated in early human trials. Specific angiotensin antagonists, such as renin inhibitors and converting enzyme inhibitors, were studied early during pharmacological blockade of the renin system. Early angiotensin antagonists were limited by the need for intravenous administration and their short half-lives. They also had the potential for mixed agonist/antagonist physiological and pharmacological effects that could result in a suppressive response rather than a suppressive response. Angiotensin receptor antagonists, similar to other well-defined systems, have an affinity for blocking the specific receptor at the target tissue site. Newer angiotensin antagonists do not have the limitations of precursor peptides. Losartan (DUP753) is a specific angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist. It is orally effective without agonist activity and has high receptor binding properties. Early studies indicate that this is a specific probe of the renin system and provides new insights into the role of the renin system in cardiovascular disorders. Emerging clinical studies show that it is effective in lowering blood pressure and as a vasodilator. Aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone have been available for decades. Spironolactone is used in an ongoing trial to evaluate the effect of combined converting enzyme and aldosterone inhibition. Newer aldosterone antagonists may contribute to targeted aldosterone blockade without the adverse effects of the precursor compound and the potential for combined specific renin system blockade.",0,0

1282,7521831,Race and hypertension. What is clinically significant?,,"Rutledge, D R","Once rare in Africa, hypertension is common in more urban areas of Africa as well as in most Black populations outside the continent. The prevalence of hypertension in Black citizens of the United States is among the highest in the world. Pathophysiological mechanisms suggest that the incidence of salt-sensitive blood pressure is more common in black patients. A more black than white patient initially presents with volume enlargement. However, there does not appear to be a significant relationship between plasma renin activity, plasma volume, and blood pressure in Black patients. Insulin resistance syndrome has also been reported in African Americans. Future studies should address this issue, both as it relates to identifying individuals at risk of developing high blood pressure and has implications for the initial choice of antihypertensive therapy. Hypertensive kidney disease is common in Black people. Lowering blood pressure with diuretic-based therapies has not been shown to delay or prevent loss of kidney function in patients with this condition, suggesting that this treatment approach may not be optimal. Lifestyle changes remain the first treatment regimen. Because diuretics and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in controlled clinical trials, they are the treatment of choice. The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program has shown significant reductions in morbidity and mortality in Black patients using primarily diuretic-based therapies. However, controversy remains regarding the use of diuretics, as some researchers believe that greater reductions in overall cardiovascular risk can be achieved in Black patients using other agents. These agents may ultimately exert a beneficial cardiovascular effect in addition to and independently of their blood pressure lowering effects. Long-term data are needed documenting reduced morbidity and mortality rates with other agents for all populations, particularly in black hypertensive patients.",0,0
1283,7523058,Exercise testing in heart failure. A critical review.,,"Swedberg, K","Exercise intolerance is one of the primary features of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Therefore, exercise testing is widely used in the evaluation of patients with CHF, both to define the severity of the disease and to evaluate the efficacy of pharmaceutical agents in clinical trials. A number of different exercise tests can be used, but the most common is the maximum exercise test. Maximum exercise capacity can be determined by measuring exercise duration or maximum oxygen (O2) consumption during incremental exercise, or can be estimated by anaerobic threshold. While basic exercise testing can accurately identify and quantify heart failure and determine prognosis in CHF patients, it is of limited value in evaluating changes that occur as a result of drug therapy. A major disadvantage of exercise testing as a measure of drug efficacy is that exercise changes produced by drug intervention do not correlate well with changes in mortality. In clinical trials with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and vasodilators, few examples were observed of the lack of correlation between exercise testing and death rates. ACE inhibitors have a moderate effect on maximal exercise capacity, but they improve survival. Neuroendocrine activation is thought to more closely reflect mortality rates, as well as changes in survival observed with pharmacological intervention, compared with other modes of assessment.",0,0

Patients were then removed from treatment for 7 days and then the cycle was repeated. Treatment continued until evidence of disease progression.; Forty-two patients were included in this study with a minimum follow-up of 40 weeks. Of the 18 patients with measurable soft tissue disease, three showed complete response (CR) and six partial response (PR) for more than 2 months.

A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and its therapeutic use in essential hypertension.,,"Wiseman, L R; McTavish, D","Trandolapril is a non-sulphydryl prodrug that is hydrolyzed in the liver to the active diacid trandolapril after oral administration. Trandolaprilat inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and improves hemodynamic and cardiac parameters in patients with essential hypertension, showing pharmacodynamic properties similar to other ACE inhibitors. Trandolapril 2 to 4 mg once daily effectively controls blood pressure for at least 24 hours in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In a small number of double-blind comparative studies, trandolapril had similar antihypertensive efficacy to atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and sustained-release nifedipine, but more effective than captopril. Combined treatment with trandolapril and hydrochlorothiazide or sustained-release nifedipine had a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either drug therapy alone. Further comparative trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary findings. The tolerability profile of trandolapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors, most side effects are generally mild and transient, and trandolapril is devoid of adverse effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Thus, with its favorable pharmacological profile and antihypertensive activity similar to that of agents currently used to treat patients with mild to moderate hypertension, trandolapril likely offers a well-tolerated option for the treatment of this disease. The results of ongoing and future clinical trials will determine its potential as a cardioprotective agent in patients following myocardial infarction.",0,0

1288,7527326,Quinapril. Re-evaluation of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in cardiovascular disorders.,,"Plosker, G L; Sorkin, E M","Following systemic absorption, quinapril is converted by deesterification to quinapril (active diacid metabolite), an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Pharmacodynamic studies in animals show inhibition of ACE both in plasma and at tissue sites such as the artery wall and heart following administration of quinapril. Tissue ACE inhibition may be an important component of the mechanism of action of quinapril (and other ACE inhibitors) to achieve positive effects in cardiovascular disorders. The elimination half-life of quinapril is short (approximately 2 hours), but it binds strongly to and slowly dissociates from ACE, thus allowing once or twice daily administration of quinapril in the treatment of patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure. Quinapril 10 to 40 mg/day provided adequate blood pressure control in the majority of patients with essential hypertension in clinical studies. Some patients required doses of quinapril up to 80 mg daily and/or concomitant diuretic therapy. Titrating quinapril dosages from 10 to 40 mg/day increased response rates without increasing the incidence or severity of adverse events. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to quinapril therapy improved response rates by approximately 10% to 20% in patients with hypertension. Overall, blood pressure control with quinapril monotherapy was similar to that achieved with enalapril or other standard antihypertensive agents in comparative studies. Quinapril < or = 40 mg/day improved exercise tolerance, reduced severity and frequency of symptoms, and improved functional (New York Heart Association) class in most clinical trials of patients with congestive heart failure. In addition, the beneficial hemodynamic and echocardiographic changes achieved with quinapril were maintained for up to 1 year with continuous administration to such patients, although the effect on survival in patients with congestive heart failure has not been reported. The tolerability profile of quinapril is broadly similar to that of other ACE inhibitors; Pooled data from clinical studies showed that 12% of patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure receiving quinapril experienced a treatment-related adverse event compared to 15% of enalapril recipients and 16% of captopril recipients. Therefore, quinapril has clearly identified a role as an effective and well tolerated alternative to other ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Although the effects of quinapril on survival of patients with congestive heart failure have not been established, large intervention studies have shown increased mortality rates with other ACE inhibitors. Further studies involving a large ongoing trial of normotensive patients with coronary artery disease but normal left ventricular function may also have a role for quinapril in the treatment of patients with ischemic heart disease.",0,0

The results show that patients with severe granulocytopenia (< 0.1 x 10(9)/l) treated with hematopoietic growth factors have a significantly faster recovery of peripheral blood granulocytes compared to previously published studies. At the same time, a significantly lower mortality rate was observed. A mortality rate of 5% was noted in patients with severe granulocytopenia treated with GM-CSF or G-CSF. No difference in granulocyte recovery was observed in patients treated with GM-CSF or G-CSF. The results of this review show that G-CSF and GM-CSF accelerate the healing of the myeloid lineage, resulting in a faster normalization of peripheral blood granulocyte count and a reduced incidence of fatal complications.",0,0
1292,7533694,Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in Raynaud's phenomenon.,,"Challenor, V F","Patients with Raynaud's phenomenon often exhibit reversible digital vasospasm in response to cold. While this condition usually responds to simple physical measures, in severe cases the symptoms may require medication. Arterial vasodilators have generally been tried in clinical practice, but recently ACE inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials for this condition. Case studies, non-comparative and placebo-controlled studies have shown mixed results of ACE inhibitor therapy in Raynaud's phenomenon. While these drugs reduced symptoms in some patients, the results were not consistent. Consistent statistically significant changes were also not demonstrated in objective improvement measures, such as the evaluation of digital blood flow patterns. However, well-conducted dose titration studies in patients with Reynaud's phenomenon have not been conducted, and objective methods of assessing this condition need improvement. The mode of action of ACE inhibitors is promising and these agents do not have significant side effects in this population. While ACE inhibitors are not currently recommended for the routine treatment of Reynaud's phenomenon, further controlled studies that may have improved peripheral activity with newer ACE inhibitors may change this view.",0,0
1293,7537194,doxazosin An update of its clinical pharmacology and therapeutic applications in hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia.,,"Fulton, B; Wagstaff, A J; Sorkin, E M","Doxazosin is a long-acting alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist structurally related to prazosin and terazosin. Its antihypertensive effect is produced by a decrease in the smooth muscle tone of the peripheral vascular beds resulting in a reduction in total peripheral resistance without a significant effect on cardiac output or heart rate. In benign prostatic hyperplasia, the bladder outlet decongestion effect of doxazosin is produced through a reduction in prostate tone mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. In most comparative studies, doxazosin has proven equally effective as a comparator in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. It has been used in a variety of patient populations, including the elderly, Blacks, smokers, and patients with concomitant disease conditions such as renal dysfunction, hypercholesterolemia, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and respiratory disease. Doxazosin has also been used successfully in combination with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, diuretics, calcium channel antagonists, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with hypertension uncontrolled by monotherapy. Doxazosin has a beneficial effect on some risk factors associated with coronary heart disease, including elevated serum lipid levels, impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Modest reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides have been observed with doxazosin treatment, while small increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/total cholesterol have been consistently reported. Some studies have reported an improvement in glucose tolerance, but this effect was seen more consistently in nondiabetic patients than in patients with NIDDM. In addition, doxazosin produces a similar reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy compared to other antihypertensive agents. Modeling calculations suggest that doxazosin significantly reduces the risk of developing coronary heart disease in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, but this remains to be confirmed in long-term prospective studies. Doxazosin appears to be a promising agent in the treatment of urinary symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Similar to other alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, doxazosin therapy produces increases in peak and mean urine flow rates and improves other objective and symptomatic measures.",0,0

During the 12-week titration period, the daily dose of enalapril was increased from 10 to 20 mg and the dose of nifedipine 40 to 60 mg to 80 mg, if necessary, at 4-week intervals. Blood pressure, 24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UAE), biochemical data, and serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity were measured at weeks -6, -4, 0, 4, 8, and 12. At week 0, venous blood was also sampled for baseline plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, renin, aldosterone, and serum insulin concentrations; At week 12, the mean daily dose of enalapril was 35 +/- 11.4 mg, and 27 (57%) patients were receiving the maximum daily dose of 40 mg. In the nifedipine group, the mean daily dose was 50 +/- 12.9 mg, and 4 (8%) were taking the maximum daily dose of 80 mg.

Sodium and fluid retention is a well-documented phenomenon in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), but whether diabetes-related changes in cortisol metabolism contribute to its pathogenesis is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated some aspects of cortisol metabolism by measuring the urinary metabolites of cortisol and cortisone in eight microalbuminuric and eight normoalbuminuric IDDM patients and eight matched control subjects. In both IDDM groups, overnight excretion of tetrahydrocortisol (THF), allo-tetrahydrocortisol (allo-THF), and tetrahydrocortisone (THE) was lower than in the control group (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). Both the allo-THF/THF ratio, a parameter of 5 alpha/5 beta reduction of cortisol and the cortisol/cortisone metabolite ratio (THF+allo-THF/THE), reflecting the general direction of the conversion of cortisol to cortisone, were lower in the IDDM groups (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). In combined subjects (n = 24), allo-THF, allo-THF/THF, and THF+allo-THF/THE were inversely proportional to hemoglobin A1c (r = -0.69, P < 0.001; r = -0.61, P < 0.01; and r = -0.58, P < 0.01, respectively).

In seven microalbuminuric IDDM patients, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (10 mg daily for 6-12 weeks) resulted in a moderate further reduction of the cortisol/cortisone metabolite ratio (P < 0.05). Available data suggest a chronic impairment of the reduction of corticoids to tetrahydro metabolites due to hyperglycemia and an imbalance in 11 beta HSD. Altered 11 beta HSD activity is unlikely to be primarily responsible for sodium and fluid retention in IDDM. Furthermore, an additional mechanism of action of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition may be provided by an effect on 11 beta HSD activity.",0,0

All patients were New York Heart Association Functional Class II, III, or IV and remained symptomatic despite optimal digoxin and diuretic doses. After 12 weeks of treatment, the improvement in treadmill exercise time was greater in the lisinopril group (113 seconds) compared to the placebo group (86 seconds). This improvement in exercise time was particularly evident in patients with left ventricular ejection fractions below 35% (lisinopril = 130 seconds; placebo = 94 seconds). In patients receiving lisinopril, the increase in exercise duration was accompanied by an improvement in quality of life as measured by the Yale Scale Dyspnea/Fatigue Index and in heart failure signs and symptoms. In addition, the lisinopril group had a larger mean increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (3.7%) compared to the placebo group (1.3%). Therefore, lisinopril administered once daily for 12 weeks was well tolerated and effective in the treatment of heart failure when used in combination with diuretics and digoxin.",1,0

A recent randomized, controlled Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study demonstrated that captopril therapy improved survival in myocardial infarction survivors with ejection fraction < or = 40%. The current ancillary study is designed to determine what the costs are to achieve this increase in survival compared with other medical interventions; We developed a decision-analytical model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of captopril therapy in 50 to 80-year-old myocardial infarction survivors with an ejection fraction < or = 40%. Data on costs, benefits (health-related quality of life weights), and 4-year survival were obtained directly from the SAVE trial, and long-term survival was estimated using a Markov model. In one set of analyzes we assumed that the survival benefit associated with captopril therapy would last more than 4 years (permanent benefit analyses), in another group we assumed that captopril therapy was costly but did not provide a survival benefit beyond 4 years (limited benefit analyses); In limited benefit analyzes, the increased cost-effectiveness of captopril therapy ranged from $3,600 per quality-adjusted life-year for patients aged 80 to $60,800 per quality-adjusted life-year for patients aged 50 years. In sustained benefit analyzes, incremental cost-effectiveness rates ranged from $3,700 to $10,400/quality-adjusted life-year, depending on age. The result was generally not sensitive to changes in variable estimates when individually varied over wide ranges. In a 'worst case' analysis, the increased cost-effectiveness rates for captopril therapy remained favorable for patients 60 to 80 years of age ($8,700 to $29,200/quality-adjusted life-year) but higher ($217,600/quality-adjusted life-year) - years) for patients aged 50 years; We conclude that the cost-effectiveness of captopril therapy for 50- to 80-year-old survivors of low ejection fraction myocardial infarction compares favorably with other interventions for myocardial infarction survivors.",0,0

Sixty-nine percent of subjects increased their sodium excretion under stress (""jumpers"") and 31% decreased it (""conservatives""). In addition to increased potassium excretion (p < 0.006), drainers also showed less of the stress-related increase in systolic (p = 0.055) and diastolic (p = 0.040) blood pressure, and more anger expression (p < 0.02) than conservatives. . The same subjects were also studied to determine the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (captopril 25 mg bid) on sodium excretion. On captopril, the secretagogues showed retention of sodium (p < 0.001) and potassium (p < 0.01) under residual stress and did not differ significantly in residual blood pressure reactivity. The results suggest that there are two different stress-related patterns of renal sodium excretion, and that these patterns may be related to the stress responses of blood pressure and anger expression.

Compared with pyretanide monotherapy, the gain in antihypertensive effect in the supine position averaged 2.1 mm Hg [90% confidence interval (CI) -0.8-5.0 mm Hg; p = 0.07] systolic BP (SBP) and 1.9 mm Hg (CI 0.3-3.5 mm Hg, p = 0.02) compared with DBP and ramipril monotherapy, these differences were 4.2 mm Hg (CI 1.3-7.0 mm Hg, p = 0.008) and 2 0.0 mm Hg (CI 0.5-3.6 mm Hg, p = 0.009). The incidence of adverse events (AE) and changes in biochemical measures were similar in the three treatment groups, except for spontaneously reported polyuria and serum uric acid concentration. Polyuria was reported more frequently (p < 0.001) with pyretanide therapy (n = 23) and combined therapy (n = 19) than with ramipril therapy (n = 1). (Abstract DISCONTINUED TO 250 WORDS)",0,0

The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of moexipril as add-on to nifedipine retard (20 mg bid) was compared with placebo for 8 weeks in a double-blind study in a parallel-group design. A total of 203 patients with essential hypertension with nifedipine alone and a sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 95 mm Hg were randomly assigned to placebo or moexipril 3.75 mg daily, 7.5 mg daily, or 15 mg daily. At the endpoint, adjusted mean reductions from baseline were 6 mm Hg, 9 mm Hg (p < 0.01) and 9 mm Hg (p < 0.05) in the moexipril 3.75 mg, 7.5 mg, and 15 mg groups, respectively. compared to 5 mm Hg in the placebo group.

Previous echocardiographic and left ventriculographic studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy limits left ventricular dilatation, particularly in patients with anterior wall acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or impaired left ventricular function. Forty-three patients with acute Q-wave AMI were randomized to intravenous enalaprilat (1 mg) or placebo within 24 hours of symptom onset. The patients were then given the corresponding oral therapy and followed for 1 month. Predrug and 1-month gated blood pool scans were obtained in 32 patients to assess changes in cardiac volumes and ejection fraction. Twenty-three patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 1 month to evaluate left ventricular infarction enlargement. Blood pressure dropped at 6 hours, but returned to baseline in both groups after 1 month of treatment. Change in cardiac volumes from baseline to 1 month, placebo (end-diastolic volume +16 +/- 5 ml, end-systolic volume +8 +/- 6 ml) and enalapril (end-diastolic volume -8 +/- 9 ml and end-systolic volume - 14 +/- 7 ml) groups (p < 0.05 vs. placebo). Global and infarct zone ejection fractions improved significantly at 1 month in the enalapril group (+6 +/- 3% and 19 +/- 5%, respectively) but remained unchanged over 1 month in the placebo group. Infarct segment length and infarct enlargement index by magnetic resonance imaging were significantly less in those treated with enalapril, suggesting less infarct enlargement in this group. Therefore, early administration of enalaprilat to patients presenting with a first Q-wave AMI prevents cardiac dilation and infarct enlargement.",1,0

Side effects of interferon therapy were observed in 38 patients affected by type II essential mixed cryoglobulinemia. Patients were treated with 3 million units (MU) daily or on consecutive days with recombinant interferon-alpha 2a (35 patients) or natural interferon-beta (3 patients). The duration of treatment ranged from 6 to 15 months; Total follow-up, including post-treatment, ranged from 8 to 93 months; Of the 35 patients treated with interferon alone, no significant haematological changes developed. In addition, none of the 7 patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors alone showed haematological toxicity. Three patients treated with a combination of interferon and ACE inhibitors developed severe granulocytopenia a few days after starting treatment. Granulocytopenia resolved within 1 to 2 weeks after suspending treatment. Restarting therapy with this drug combination produced a recurrence of granulocytopenia in 1 patient. In these 3 patients, interferon treatment alone or ACE inhibitor monotherapy did not follow granulocytopenia; Although severe haematological toxicity rarely developed in patients treated with low-dose interferon, granulocytopenia occurred in all of our 3 patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia treated with a combination of low-dose interferon-alpha 2a and ACE inhibitors. Neither drug was toxic alone in any of our cryoglobulinemic patients, indicating a high risk of serious haematological toxicity for this drug combination, at least in patients with this disease.

Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, plasma glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose load (75 g), lipid profile and urinary albumin excretion were evaluated before and after 8 weeks of administration of quinapril (10 to 40 mg/day). Quinapril produced a significant and comparable reduction in arterial blood pressure in both groups. Mean arterial pressure in the essential hypertensive group ranged from 114.8 +/- 0.9 to 94.2 +/- 1.1 (-17.9 +/- 1.5%) and 118.4 +/- 1, decreased from 6 to 96.2 +/- 1.4 (-18.4 +/- 1.6%) in the diabetic hypertensive group. In both essential hypertensive and diabetic-hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria, quinapril significantly and comparably reduced the urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE); UAE, from 32.5 +/- 5.5 mcg/min to 14.7 +/- 3.7 mcg/min (P < .05 v baseline) and 27.5 +/- 3.0 mcg/min to 11.6 mcg/min in the diabetic-hypertensive group decreased to +/- 2.7 micrograms/min in essential hypertensives (P < .05 v baseline). Overall, a direct correlation was found between baseline level of UAE and decrease in UAE (delta UAE) after quinapril (r = 0.706, p < .05). Insulin and glucose responses to the oral glucose tolerance test and lipid profiles were not altered by quinapril treatment. The results confirm that quinapril is an effective antihypertensive agent that additionally reduces microalbuminuria in both hypertensive diabetics and patients with essential hypertension without altering insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles.",0,0

In conclusion, patients with generalized myopathies are likely to have increased morbidity and mortality from cardiomyopathy. One hundred consecutive patients with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy and a mean age of 17.2 years (range, 5-41) met criteria for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and received digitalis and diuretics. Nine of the 14 patients were asymptomatic despite left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) of 25-40%. Five patients with symptomatic heart failure had severe ventricular dilatation with LVEF < 25%. Two of the five patients died of heart failure within 1 year. For the remaining three patients, we evaluated the addition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril followed by the use of beta-blockers to the therapeutic regimen. Addition of these drugs, previously untested in the treatment of generalized myopathic disease-associated cardiomyopathy, was complementary in alleviating symptoms and reversing signs of congestive heart failure and DCM. We conclude that the combination of ACE inhibitor and beta blocker deserves further investigation for inclusion in any management regimen for the treatment of muscular dystrophy-associated cardiomyopathy.",0,0

Participants with ADPKD had a faster rate of decline than those with other diagnoses, reflecting, in part, faster disease progression in the ADPKD group. Key features predicting a faster rate of decline in GFR in people with ADPKD were higher serum creatinine (independent of GFR), higher urinary protein excretion, higher mean arterial pressure (MAP), and younger age. In patients with baseline GFR values between 25 and 55 mL/min per 1.73 m2, assignment to neither the low protein diet group nor the low blood pressure group did not significantly reduce the rate of GFR decline in ADPKD participants. Similarly, the decrease in GFR was not related to the resulting protein intake or MAP. In participants with GFR values between 13 and 24 mL/min per 1.73 m2, assignment to the low MAP group resulted in a slightly faster decline in GFR. However, the faster decline in GFR was not due to the detrimental effect of lower blood pressure or the antihypertensive agents used to achieve the lower blood pressure goal. Lower protein intake but not prescribing keto acid-amino acid supplements was marginally associated with slower progression of kidney disease.",0,0

Captopril 25 mg (or placebo) was given twice, before the maximal symptom-limited cycling exercise test (11:00), namely in the evening (10:00) and the next morning (8:00). Captopril reduced resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures without causing any reflex tachycardia (p < 0.01). Time to onset of ST depression was prolonged (p < 0.05) and maximum ST depression decreased (p < 0.02). No difference was found between captopril and placebo in terms of total exercise time or time to angina onset. The effects of captopril on exercise-induced ischemia were most clearly demonstrated in patients who responded with a reduction in resting systolic blood pressure of more than 10 mm Hg. In conclusion, this study suggests that captopril has anti-ischemic properties that may be important in the treatment of patients with chronic stable angina and normal left ventricular function. These beneficial effects are probably related to the reduction in afterload and myocardial wall stress, and hence the reduction in myocardial oxygen demand.",0,0
1323,7585774,Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors after myocardial infarction.,,"Young, J B","Results from the SOLVD, SAVE, AIRE, GISSI-III, ISIS-IV, and Chinese Captopril Trial demonstrate that at least treatment with ACE inhibitors in combination with enalapril, captopril, ramipril, and lisinopril results in significant reductions in morbidity and mortality in patients. with ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction and a wide range of ventricular function and myocardial infarction. In particular, SOLVD and SAVE results show that survival is increased and major ischemic events are decreased in patients with depressed systolic ventricular function. SOLVD indicates that the institution of ACE inhibitor therapy need not be done immediately after myocardial infarction to obtain benefit. On the other hand, GISSI-III and ISIS-IV suggest that the use of ACE inhibitor drugs in the early post-myocardial infarction period confers substantial, albeit small, benefits in conjunction with other routinely used therapeutic strategies when drugs are started early after the event. The prospective, well-designed and well-controlled nature of these clinical trials, the consistency of their findings, and the high levels of morbidity and mortality in the placebo groups demonstrate the importance of preventing ischemic events with prescribed ACE inhibitors. It is particularly important that none of these clinical trials were designed to determine the optimal dose or frequency of administration of selected ACE inhibitors. Targeting dose principles were used, and clinicians wishing to achieve similar results in their patient population should select one of the ACE inhibitors studied and apply it as described in the hope of achieving results similar to those detailed in the clinical trials outlined. Finally, recommendations for post-myocardial infarction treatment with ACE inhibitors can be summarized. Ventricular function evaluation should be performed in patients with acute or distant infarction. All patients with depressed systolic function, symptomatic or not, should receive an appropriate ACE inhibitor trial. Early assessment of ventricular function should be performed in patients with acute myocardial infarction and an appropriately selected ACE inhibitor should be initiated after 24 hours if the ejection fraction is low (possibly < 50%). ACE inhibitor therapy should be initiated in combination with other proven effective post-myocardial infarction treatment strategies. In patients with normal systolic function, the advantages of ACE inhibitor therapy are less clear, but patients with large anterior wall myocardial infarction will likely benefit even in the absence of objective evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Concomitant use of thrombolytic agents, aspirin, and beta-blockers should not preclude the use of ACE inhibitor therapy.",0,0

At this dose, 94.1% of patients reduced their diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 10 mm Hg or reached DBP < or = 90 mm Hg. Overall, quinapril decreased DBP proportionally to baseline DBP between 14.8 and 24.8 mm Hg. Systolic blood pressure dropped from baseline levels of 16 to 35.7 mm Hg.

In this double-blind study, 13 patients were randomized to receive captopril, 12 to receive enalapril, and 11 to placebo for 12 months. Acute myocardial infarction in patients receiving placebo has been associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems and stimulation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide levels. ACE inhibition did not significantly alter circulating levels of norepinephrine, brain natriuretic peptide, or atrial natriuretic peptide. Compared to placebo, enalapril caused a steep decrease in plasma ACE activity and plasma angiotensin II levels were lowered by both ACE inhibitors. Using grouped data, circulating brain natriuretic peptide levels at time zero sampling were significantly higher than atrial natriuretic peptide values. Brain natriuretic peptide levels at 72 hours were significantly correlated with the radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction measured 5 days and 3 months after infarction. Similar associations were observed for atrial natriuretic peptide and norepinephrine. We confirm the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems after acute myocardial infarction.

Pressure-angiographic data were obtained from 16 patients with overt heart failure and 47 patients without heart failure. Repeat studies were conducted in 41 patients following 1 year of treatment with enalapril or placebo. Left ventricular silhouettes were divided into 18 segments to estimate regional ejection fraction, wall stress, and myocardial damage (% myocardial damage). Contraction status was assessed and ranked by a scoring method based on ejection rate-preload-postload relationships and 10 myocardial and ventricular function parameters. Patients had significantly higher end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (EDV, ESV) (P < 0.001), lower ejection fraction (EF) (P < 0.009), greater % of myocardial damage (P < 0.008) and contractile status. was more depressed. with overt heart failure. Changes in EDV and ESV (delta placebo vs. delta enalapril) were significant (delta EDV, P < 0.003; delta ESV, P < 0.014). Directional shifts in diastolic pressure-volume relationships with enalapril or placebo were primarily due to basal contractile state and diastolic volume range. The single best predictors of post-treatment EF were score index (a surrogate parameter for contractile state) and ESV. Additional benefits of enalapril include prevention of further dilatation and delay in onset of heart failure in patients with less depressed convulsive states. Asymptomatic patients with LV dysfunction should also be considered for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy.",0,0

However, simultaneous neutral endopeptidase and ACE inhibition induces a synergistic effect and may therefore represent an interesting new therapeutic approach to the treatment of essential hypertension.",0,0

1336,7599749,Neurohormonal activation in patients with acute myocardial infarction or chronic congestive heart failure. With specific reference to treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Sigurdsson, A","Neurohormonal activation may provide a pathophysiological link between acute myocardial infarction and chronic congestive heart failure, and modulation of neurohormonal activity may be an important therapeutic target in these situations. Plasma neurohormones were studied in 55 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Angiotensin II, noradrenaline and ANP were elevated in the early phase but tended to return to normal within the first week in patients without signs of heart failure. Angiotensin II and noradrenaline remained elevated for 1 month and ANP for 4-6 months in patients with heart failure. During head tilt, angiotensin II and noradrenaline were most increased in patients with heart failure. In patients with first myocardial infarction, there was a positive correlation between sustained neurohormonal activity and infarct size. Nearly complete suppression of plasma ACE activity was achieved within 30 minutes in 48 patients treated with intravenous enalaprilat initiated within 24 hours of the onset of infarction. The drug was tolerated at dosages of 1.0-1.2 mg given over 1-2 hours. Patients with systolic blood pressure between 100 and 110 mmHg were at greater risk of hypotension than patients with higher blood pressure at baseline. Tolerance was not worse in patients treated with intravenous diuretics, metoprolol or nitroglycerin. A total of 98 patients were randomized to treatment with enalapril or placebo, which was initiated within 24 hours of the onset of infarction and continued for 4-6 months. There was no significant difference in plasma levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone, ANP or catecholamines between groups during treatment. Echocardiographic recordings were made in 28 patients. Among patients taking placebo, 5-7. A positive correlation between plasma noradrenaline levels on days 5-7 and an increase in left ventricular volumes over the study period. There was an inverse correlation between plasma aldosterone on days and the increase in left ventricular ejection. fraction during operation. No such association was found among patients using enalapril. ANP levels at month 1 were also inversely proportional to left ventricular ejection fraction. Plasma neurohormones were measured in 223 patients with mild or moderate chronic heart failure who were randomized to treatment with ramipril or placebo for 3 months. There were large differences in hormone levels. Noradrenaline and aldosterone were inversely proportional to baseline exercise time. Noradrenaline correlated positively with the degree of symptoms. Aldosterone and ANP were decreased with ramipril compared to placebo. Noradrenaline was decreased in patients with the highest baseline tertile. Plasma hormones were also measured during peak exercise in 54 patients. Resting hormonal levels were strongly correlated with those at most intense exercise.",0,0

1338,7601014,Spirapril. A preliminary review of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of hypertension.,,"Noble, S; Sorkin, E M","Spirapril is a non-sulphydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prodrug that is converted to the active metabolite spiraprilat following oral administration and is primarily evaluated for the treatment of hypertension. In dose-finding studies in patients with mild to severe hypertension, spirapril > or = 6 mg once daily produced reductions in blood pressure of approximately 10 to 18 mm Hg (systolic) and 7 to 13 mm Hg (diastolic) [24 hours post dose]. trough readings at the end of the treatment period]. At the end of these investigations, blood pressure normalization (diastolic blood pressure trough or = 90 mm Hg) occurred in 29% to 50% of patients. The dose-response curve for Spirapril appears to be flat for doses of 6 to 24 mg once daily. Comparisons with other ACE inhibitors are limited in number and more studies are needed to fully evaluate the relative antihypertensive efficacy of spirapril. However, in single, well-controlled clinical studies, spirapril produced reductions in blood pressure similar to those seen with enalapril or captopril. When given as monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, spirapril may provide potential advantages over the calcium antagonist nitrendipine. Spirapril is generally well tolerated and produces a side-effect profile similar to other ACE inhibitors. Data from small studies suggest that spirapril can be used without dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment as a result of dual renal and hepatic clearance mechanisms. This is in contrast to most ACE inhibitors, which are eliminated by a predominantly renal mechanism and cause accumulation of the active metabolite when renal function is impaired. However, the benefit of spirapril in this patient group has not yet been fully established due to conflicting data on its effects on kidney function. Therefore, spirapril is an effective antihypertensive agent that is well tolerated. More comparative studies are needed to fully determine its efficacy over other ACE inhibitors, and a better understanding of its effects on kidney function will clarify its role in hypertensive patients with renal failure.",0,0

Trandolapril Multicenter Study Group.,,"Weir, M R; Gray, J M; Paster, R; Saunders, E","The antihypertensive effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril administered at doses of 1, 2, and 4 mg/day was compared in 207 white patients and 91 black patients with mild to moderate hypertension following a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled treatment. , parallel run design. Trandolapril is a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed to its active diacid metabolite, trandolaprilat. After 6 weeks of double-blind treatment, trandolapril reduced baseline sitting diastolic pressure in both white and black patients. Comparison of the antihypertensive response of the two populations revealed that black patients required two to four times the dose of trandolapril to achieve a response similar to that observed in white patients. The 1 mg/day dose of trandolapril resulted in a mean sitting basal diastolic pressure reduction of 6.1 mm Hg in white patients; A similar response (-6.5 mm Hg) was observed in black patients at 4 mg/d. In contrast to population differences in blood pressure, decreases in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity were similar for both populations. An evaluation of trandolaprilat levels revealed no racial differences in trandolaprilat concentrations required to achieve a given degree of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. Thus, the antihypertensive response of black patients does not appear to be fully explained by a reduction in angiotensin converting enzyme activity. No response at a lower dose but increased response at a higher dose may reflect another vasodepressor activity of trandolapril or may be evidence of decreased susceptibility of high blood pressure in blacks to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.",0,0

Patients with moderate or severe heart failure whose condition was stabilized by previous treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor were randomly assigned to receive either enalapril or losartan. The study was designed to detect any signs of clinical deterioration during double-blind therapy; Losartan is a specific, non-peptide angiotensin II receptor-1 antagonist with a vasodilator hemodynamic profile similar to converting enzyme inhibitors. Although treatment with specific receptor blockade has certain theoretical advantages over non-specific converting enzyme inhibition, demonstration of a comparable therapeutic effect in patients with congestive heart failure will require a major effort to compare the two active agents; One hundred and sixty-six patients with stable heart failure of New York Heart Association functional class III or IV and ejection fraction < or = 35% were enrolled in a multicenter, double-blind, parallel, enalapril-controlled study.

The study included 145 patients with documented AMI. During a median follow-up of 3.7 years, 30 cardiovascular and 6 non-cardiovascular deaths occurred. By univariate analysis, plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and endothelin levels were strongly associated with long-term cardiovascular mortality. In multivariate models, both peptides added prognostic information to those derived from clinical evaluation but not left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Estimation of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve showed comparable prognostic accuracy for LVEF (0.7788), plasma ANF (0.7795), plasma endothelin (0.7493) and Killip classification (0.8203); this means that for all these prognostic indicators, a patient randomly selected from a dying group will have a greater test value 75% to 82% of the time than a randomly selected patient from a surviving group. The clinical utility of neurohumoral determination in routine risk stratification after AMI appears to be limited, as no additional prognostic information is available to that provided by objective assessment of LV systolic function. However, in patients for whom an objective assessment of LV performance is not readily available, measurement of plasma ANF and endothelin may be helpful in identifying asymptomatic patients at risk of cardiac death.",0,0

1354,7624954,Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in the treatment of renal transplant erythrocytosis. Clinical experience and observation of the mechanism.,,"Danovitch, G M; Jamgotchian, N J; Eggena, P H; Paul, W; Barrett, J D; Wilkinson, A; Lee, D B","Recent observations suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition improves renal transplant erythrocytosis (RTE). The mechanism of this relationship is unknown. We examined the effect of ACE inhibition on hematocrit, erythropoietin (EPO) and renin substrate. It has been reported that ACE inhibition suppresses EPO and the renin substrate, which is known to stimulate erythropoiesis. In 15 patients with RTE, the hematocrit decreased from 52.8 +/- 0.6 (SEM) to 45.8% +/- 1.4% after 8 weeks of treatment with 2.5-20 mg/day Enalapril. Serum EPO (normal range: 9-30 mU/ml) was high in one patient, normal in seven patients, and low in seven patients. ACE inhibition reduced EPO in patients with high or normal levels at baseline, but resulted in no change in patients with low baseline levels. ACE inhibition had no significant effect on the renin substrate. In one patient who rejected his first graft, erythrocytosis recurred after the second successful transplant. Treatment was discontinued due to cough in two patients and symptomatic blood pressure decrease in one patient. We conclude that RTE is not caused by hypererythropoietinemia. In patients with normal circulating EPO, erythrocytosis may result from increased sensitivity to EPO, and ACE inhibition lowers the hematocrit with further reduction of this hormone. However, the finding of erythrocytosis in half of our patients with suppressed EPO suggests the involvement of a non-EPO-mediated mechanism(s). Recurrence of RTE in a patient after a second transplant raises the possibility of additional patient-specific factors in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Contrary to other reports, we documented adverse events (cough, hypotension) in three of our patients (20%). Our clinical experience, combined with previous reports of spontaneous resolution of RTE in some patients, suggests that intermittent courses of ACE inhibition may be the optimal strategy for using this form of therapy for RTE.",0,0
1355,7625425,Contemporary management of acute myocardial infarction.,,"Rogers, W J","Acute myocardial infarction, the leading cause of death in Western society, has been the focus of more randomized clinical trial efforts over the past decade than any other field of medicine. As a result of this worldwide effort, involving hundreds of thousands of patients with myocardial infarction, data have accumulated showing significantly lower mortality from acute myocardial infarction with simple interventions such as iv thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. . Emergency coronary angioplasty appears to be a viable alternative to iv thrombolytic therapy in skilled centers. Several previously recommended treatments (routine iv lidocaine, calcium channel blockers, magnesium, nitrates) have not proven to be life-saving. Whether routine coronary arteriography should be used after myocardial infarction is controversial, but it is generally accepted that patients with evidence of residual ischemia after infarction, whether spontaneous or triggered by stress testing, should undergo prophylactic coronary revascularization.",0,0

We examined the distribution of prognostic factors and survival in eligible patients in a multicenter long-term trial of oral anticoagulant therapy after myocardial infarction. All hospitals with myocardial infarction survivors were screened for entry criteria at a clinical center participating in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving long-term anticoagulant therapy after myocardial infarction. Next, prognostic factors and participants' survival were compared with eligible but not randomized patients. 350 participants were younger and more often male and smoked more often than 587 non-participants. Non-participants had a previous myocardial infarction and were more frequently treated with diuretics and ACE inhibitors, suggesting a higher proportion of patients with chronic heart failure in this group. Age, previous myocardial infarction, and use of diuretics at discharge were independent predictors of mortality, with consent not showing any association. Our findings suggest that participants in a clinical trial have a better prognosis in the first years following myocardial infarction compared to non-participants, as a result of the higher prevalence of mortality-related cardiovascular risk factors in non-participants.",0,0

1363,7641605,Guillain-Barré syndrome. Clinical manifestations and instructions for treatment.,,"Rees, J","Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is the most common cause of acute neuromuscular paralysis in today's developed world. Patients most commonly present with rapidly rising paralysis with sensory symptoms and variable autonomic involvement. The diagnosis is clinical, but lumbar puncture and nerve conduction studies are helpful in excluding other conditions. The improvement in prognosis in recent years is largely due to advances in respiratory intensive care management. Careful monitoring of cardiorespiratory function, and especially regular measurements of vital capacity, will help predict which patients will need elective ventilation to prevent possible neuromuscular respiratory failure. The paralyzed patient is particularly susceptible to all the complications of immobility, such as venous thromboembolism and hypostatic pneumonia, and therefore good nursing care and physiotherapy are imperative. Autonomic involvement may predispose to cardiac arrhythmias and unstable blood pressure. The protracted nature of the disease predisposes to psychiatric complications, particularly depression, and this should be treated appropriately. Specific treatment aims to reduce the maximum duration of disability. Both plasma exchange (PE) and intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) have been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials. A multicenter study is currently underway to determine whether PE or IVIg or PE followed by IVIg is the most effective treatment for this condition. Although there is a trial comparing the combination of IVIg and methylprednisolone with IVIg alone, the value of steroids alone has not been demonstrated. The prognosis of GBS is generally good, with about 80% of patients recovering completely, but about 5% dying from complications.",0,0

It is unknown whether this initial phenomenon is reversible (hemodynamic) or irreversible (structural damage) after prolonged AHT. To elucidate these mechanisms, we investigated 42 hypertensive IDDM patients with DN (16K/26E, age 40 +/- 7 years, mean +/- SD) who received AHT (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, N = 30) for 6 (2 to 15). . year [median (range)]. GFR (ml/min/1.73 m2), arterial blood pressure (BP, mm Hg), and albuminuria (mg/24 hours) were measured on the last day of AHT and one month after AHT cessation. All measured variables increased significantly after discontinuation of AHT: GFR [mean(SEM)] from 76(4) to 81(4) (P < 0.0001), BP [mean(SEM)] from 140/82 (2/1) ) to 151/89 (2/1) (P < 0.0005) and albuminuria [geometric mean (antilog SEM)] 704 (1.2) to 1122 (1.2) (P < 0.0001). A correlation was found between the relative increase in systolic blood pressure (delta Sys%) and the relative change in GFR (delta GFR%) (r = 0.44, P < 0.005). Our results somewhat support the hypothesis that the faster initial decline in GFR is due to the functional (hemodynamic) effect of AHT that does not decrease over time, and that the ensuing slower decline reflects the beneficial effect on the progression of diabetic nephropathy.",0,0

However, there is evidence that the benefits associated with patent IRA are disproportionate to the observed improvement in ventricular function and may result not only from salvaging the ischemic myocardium, but also from opening the IRA beyond a narrow time window post-infarction. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the effect of IRA patency on the outcome of post-MI patients with left ventricular dysfunction while controlling for differences in left ventricular ejection fraction and extent of coronary disease, and (2) to determine the effect. angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy in patients with open and occluded infarct arteries; The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study consisted of 2231 patients with documented MI and left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%. They were randomized to the ACE inhibitor captopril (50 mg TID) or placebo 3 to 16 days after MI and followed for a mean of 3.5 years. Left ventricular ejection fraction measured by radionuclide left ventriculography was repeated at the end of the follow-up period. 946 patients with IRA patency before randomization form the basis of this study. At cardiac catheterization a mean of 4.2 days after infarction, 30.7% of patients had an occluded IRA at baseline. After revascularization, 162 (17.1%) of 946 patients were left with an occluded IRA at randomization. 162 patients with a permanently occluded IRA and 784 with a patent IRA had similar clinical baseline features, but those with occluded arteries had a slightly lower ejection fraction than 784 patients with patent infarcted arteries (32% versus 30%, P = . 01). Cox proportional hazard analyzes showed that independent predictors of all-cause mortality were hypertension (relative risk [RR] 1.94, P < .001), number of diseased coronary arteries (RR 1.68, P < .001), occluded IRA (RR). 1.49, P = .039), ejection fraction (RR 1.36, P < .001), age (RR 1.10, P = .030) and use of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents (RR 0.60, P = .007). Independent predictors of a composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, morbidity, or ejection fraction reduction > or = 9 units were obstructed IRA (odds ratio [OR] 1.73, P = .002), hypertension (OR 1.71, P < .001), number of diseased vessels (OR 1.38, P < .001), ejection fraction (OR 1.18, P = .003), use of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents (OR 0.67, P = .007), and random captopril (OR 0.70, P = .009) ).; IRA patency within 16 days after MI predicts a favorable clinical outcome regardless of the number of occluded coronary arteries or left ventricular function. The beneficial effect of ACE inhibition is independent of the patency state of the IRA.

We performed a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy crossover trial in outpatients. Four phases were performed: 2 weeks of placebo, 8 weeks of maintenance (perindopril or amlodipine), and 2 weeks of washout between treatment periods. Ten hypertensive patients with stable renal allograft function transplanted more than 6 months ago and receiving cyclosporine as part of their immunosuppressive regimen were studied. Perindopril (2 or 4 mg/day) and amlodipine (5 mg/day) were given to the patients in a random order.

Short-term studies were conducted during cardiac catheterization in young normotensive subjects (mean age, 33 years; range, 19 to 40) and in several different age-matched groups of patients with essential hypertension (range, 25 to 53 years). Aortic impedance, resistance, wave reflections, and compliance were calculated from high-quality recordings of increased aortic pressure and flow signals at baseline and after nitroprusside, propranolol followed by phentolamine, phentolamine, captopril, and nifedipine, at doses sufficient to normalize blood. pressure in each hypertensive group. Propranolol exacerbated all hemodynamic parameters; these effects were only partially overcome by phentolamine. Among other agents, phentolamine alone did not completely normalize the congruence, and captopril alone did not completely normalize the wave reflections. The long-term study was a randomized, double-blind comparison of fosinopril and atenolol in 79 normotensive subjects and 79 essential hypertensive patients. After 8 weeks of treatment, carotid artery tonometry was performed to index baseline 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures and wave reflections in all subjects and hypertensive patients. Both fosinopril and atenolol normalized blood pressure and lowered the high augmentation index, but fosinopril had a significantly greater effect than atenolol. Both short-term and long-term beta-blockade did not have as beneficial effects as other agents. Therefore, the different hemodynamic effects of various classes of antihypertensive agents may be considered in treatment selection.",0,0

In a population-based case-control study that included 440 renal cell cancer cases, an additional 151 spouses, and 691 controls, we evaluated the risk of hypertension and renal cell cancer associated with the use of diuretics and other antihypertensive drugs. The risks are increased with the use of diuretics or other drugs that lower blood pressure, especially in people who do not report a history of hypertension. After adjusting for hypertension, the use of diuretics alone was associated with a 40% excess risk (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 0.8-2.2), while the use of other antihypertensive drugs was associated with a 2-fold risk (OR = 2.0). 95% CI = 1.2-3.3). The extreme risk was not limited to any specific product and no trends were observed in the estimated lifetime consumption of any product. In addition, both the presence of hypertension and the use of antihypertensive drugs did not increase the risk. Among people not using antihypertensive drugs, a history of hypertension was associated with a significant increase in the risk of renal cell cancer of 40-50%. Excluding subjects with cancer diagnosed or with hypertension diagnosed within 5 years of interview had only a minor effect on risk. These findings suggest minor effects on hypertensive disease and the risk of renal cell cancer associated with the use of diuretics and other antihypertensive drugs, but discrete effects are difficult to resolve due to possible misclassification of highly correlated events.",0,0

The results of the study showed that initiation of ACE inhibitors had no significant effect on tPA antigen or PAI activity levels at the time points studied, and no significant differences were demonstrated between captopril and enalapril. The results therefore suggest that ACE inhibitors do not affect tPA antigen or PAI activity in CHF patients, and thus another mechanism is likely responsible for the observed reduction in coronary artery thrombosis in post-MI patients treated with ACE inhibitors.",0,0

Treatment comparisons: (i) 1 month of oral captopril (6.25 mg starting dose titrated up to 50 mg twice daily) versus matched placebo; (ii) 1-month oral controlled-release mononitrate versus matched placebo (30 mg starting dose titrated to 60 mg once daily); and (iii) 24-hour intravenous magnesium sulfate (8 mmol first bolus followed by 72 mmol) versus the open control. There was no significant ""interaction"" between the effects of these three treatments, and results for each are based on a randomized comparison of approximately 29,000 active and 29,000 allocated control patients. There was a proportionally significant reduction in captopril 5-week mortality (2088 [7,19] 2231 [7.69] captopril-assigned deaths vs. placebo 7% (SD 3); 2p = 0.02), which was 4.9 SD. corresponds to an absolute difference of 2.2 fewer deaths per 1000 patients treated for 1 month. The absolute benefits appeared to be greater (probably about 10 fewer deaths per 1000) in certain high-risk groups, such as those presenting with a previous history of MI or heart failure. Survival advantage was maintained over the longer term (5.4 [SD 2.8] fewer deaths per 1000 people at 12 months). Captopril was associated with a 52 per 1000 increase in hypotension (SD 2), which was considered severe enough to warrant discontinuation of study therapy, and a 5 per 1000 (SD 2) and 5 per 1000 (SD 1) increase in reported cardiogenic shock. some degree of renal dysfunction.

Thirty-nine untreated essential hypertensive patients and 28 normotensive control subjects were studied at baseline. Hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: bisoprolol (10 mg/day, n = 15), enalapril (20 mg/day, n = 12) and verapamil SR (240 mg/day, n = 12) before and after 1 month of treatment. examined later. Plasma catecholamines were determined by a radioenzymatic assay. Surface beta 2-adrenoceptors were measured in intact lymphocytes by radioligand binding assay using the hydrophilic ligand [3H]-CGP12177. beta 2-adrenoceptor density was increased in hypertensive patients (P < .01). After treatment, mean blood pressure decreased similarly in the three groups, while plasma catecholamines did not significantly change in any group. beta 2-adrenoceptor count was decreased in patients treated with bisoprolol alone (P < .05). Mean blood pressure reductions correlated with beta 2-adrenoceptor reductions in patients treated with bisoprolol alone (r = 0.65, P < .05). beta 2-adrenoceptor density correlated with plasma epinephrine levels in the control group (r = -0.50, P < .01), but not in hypertensive patients before treatment. This correlation was also observed in hypertensive patients treated with bisoprolol (r = -0.52, P < .05), but not in those treated with verapamil or enalapril. Our results show that bisoprolol treatment reduces the increased surface beta 2-adrenoceptor density and restores its regulation by epinephrine in essential hypertension.",0,0

We examined the effect of very early treatment with enalapril in patients with left ventricular failure (Killip classification II-III) resulting from AMI.

One patient died in each treatment group. There were three discontinuations in the placebo group (progressive heart failure requiring antiotensin converting enzyme inhibition) and one dropout (malignant ventricular arrhythmias) in the enalapril group. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and norepinephrine were similarly decreased from higher baseline concentrations in both groups. Patients with the highest baseline ANP levels died in both groups: EN: 579 fmol/ml (mean 65.3 +/- 34.4 fmol/ml), PL: 403 fmol/ml (mean 63.5 +/- 37.6 fmol/ml) . Killip classification improved in 9 of 13 patients who received enalapril, compared to only 5 of 11 patients who received placebo. Echocardiography showed an increase in fractional shortening (FS) (3.2 +/- 7.5%, p < 0.05) with enalapril alone. Patients taking placebo required more diuretics and increased plasma aldosterone threefold. Therefore, very early treatment with enalapril may help prevent left ventricular failure after AMI.

Recently, the occurrence of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced anemia has been reported in chronic hemodialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients. Here we report 5 transplant recipients whose hematocrit levels fell while taking ACE inhibitors, including 2 patients treated with ACE inhibitors for erythrocytosis. Individual mean hematocrit values ranged from 35.0% to 54.7% before treatment and from 27.6% to 42.0% after treatment. In 2 patients with erythrocytosis, the hematocrit level decreased from 54.7% to 39.8% and from 47.5% to 27.6%, respectively. Anemia resolved after drug discontinuation or dose reduction. The patients were given the same immunosuppressive drugs and their kidney function was good. No obvious anemia caused by ACE inhibitor was observed in the transplant recipient who received kidney from a twin sister and did not take any immunosuppressive drugs, and in the other 8 patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic glomerulonephritis who were used as controls. We conclude that ACE inhibitor-induced anemia can often occur in an immunocompromised state. Based on these events, ACE inhibitor can be used as a potent drug for erythrocytosis in post-transplant recipients.",0,0

Drug interactions of clinical importance.,,"Mignat, C; Unger, T","ACE inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure, but there is only limited information on adverse interactions between ACE inhibitors and other cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular drugs. This article provides an overview of this topic, with emphasis on the interactions that have the greatest clinical implications. In sodium and/or volume depleted patients with thiazide or loop diuretics, the additional use of ACE inhibitors may result in excessive blood pressure reduction and symptomatic hypotension. An increase in serum potassium levels may occur after concomitant administration of potassium-sparing diuretics and ACE inhibitors, resulting in hyperkalaemia, particularly in patients with renal impairment. The incidence of acute renal failure may be associated with ACE inhibitor therapy when these drugs are combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and given to patients whose kidney function is increasingly dependent on angiotensin II and prostaglandins. There is some, albeit insufficient, evidence linking ACE inhibitors with the induction of lithium toxicity in patients taking lithium and the occurrence of severe hypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving hemodialysis, poison immunization, or concomitant allopurinol therapy.",0,0

Before and after 8 weeks of treatment, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), fibrinogen, total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides (TG), plasma glucose, plasma uric acid, serum creatinine and serum potassium were evaluated. 3. All four drugs significantly reduced BP values, although the blood pressure lowering effect of lisinopril, amlodipine and atenolol was significantly greater compared to hydrochlorothiazide. 4. Plasma fibrinogen levels were not affected by atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and amlodipine, but were significantly decreased by lisinopril (-11.2%, P = 0.002). This fibrinogen-lowering effect was more pronounced in smokers (-17.7%) than non-smokers (-7.4%). 5. Atenolol and amlodipine did not significantly affect plasma lipids, hydrochlorothiazide increased TC, LDL-C and TG, and decreased HDL-C; Lisinopril increased HDL-C and decreased TC and LDL-C. 6. Hydrochlorothiazide increased plasma glucose and uric acid concentrations unaffected by other drugs. The diuretic also decreased serum potassium. 7. The results of this study demonstrate that lisinopril reduces plasma fibrinogen levels and confirms that different antihypertensive drugs may elicit differential metabolic effects that may affect the overall risk profile of hypertensive patients in various ways.",0,0

BP variability. CBP (low measurements) and ABP (Spacelabs 90202 or 90207) were measured in 266 mildly essential hypertensive outpatients (age: 18-78 years) after 3 to 4 weeks of washout and 4 to 8 weeks of treatment with ACE-. inhibitor (n = 135) or a calcium antagonist (n = 131). ABP recordings were analyzed to obtain mean systolic and diastolic BP values and standard deviations (BP variability) at 24 hours during the day (from 6 to midnight) and at night (from midnight to 6). Treatment reduced both CBP and ABP. Treatment-related changes in CBP were weakly correlated with those in 24-hour, day, and nighttime BP (r never > 0.23), and the correlation was also weak when trough ABP (mean of the last 2 hours) was taken into account. Twenty-four-hour, daytime, and nighttime BP decreased similarly with treatment, with a direct correlation between baseline BP values and subsequent BP reductions. BP standard deviations were also reduced with treatment from pretreatment values, but the overall reduction was small, limited to the day, and was proportional to or less than proportional to the decrease in mean values, with no change or increase in the coefficients of change. The effects of ACE inhibitor and calcium antagonist treatments could overlap. Our results from a large database show that antihypertensive therapy effectively reduces all ABP components. The decrease cannot be predicted by the simultaneous decrease in CBP but is related to the initial ABP values. Treatment has a limited effect on BP variability, this applies to both ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists.",0,0

However, restenosis remains the major limitation of angioplasty, occurring in 20-50% of patients following a successful procedure. Over the past 10 years, more than 40 large randomized pharmacological studies have attempted to address this problem. Currently, no single agent has been clearly shown to reduce restenosis. The result of intensive research has resulted in a better understanding of the pathophysiology of restenosis as well as the design of clinical studies necessary to examine the process. Recent experimental studies suggest that vascular remodeling may be as important as intimal hyperplasia and future studies should address this aspect of the restenosis process. Current approaches to preventing restenosis include the use of combined drug therapy to attack various pathophysiological processes, the local delivery of the drug to the injury site to maximize drug effect, and the use of highly specific drugs, including local gene therapy.",0,0

This may help clarify the mechanism of action of the rapid beneficial effects of pravastatin on cardiovascular morbidity. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study, we treated 25 hypertensive hypercholesterolemic patients with either pravastatin or placebo for 12 weeks. While placebo treatment did not alter plasma lipids, 12 weeks of treatment with pravastatin reduced total cholesterol by 27% (7.1 +/- 0.27 to 5.2 +/- 0.18, p < 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein compared to placebo. reduced cholesterol by 35%. (4.9 +/- 0.36 to 3.2 +/- 0.17, p < 0.001). There was no change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure following 12 weeks of treatment or discontinuation of 3 weeks of pravastatin. Therefore, pravastatin remains effective as a lipid-lowering agent in the presence of antihypertensive therapy, but does not increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these drugs. Therefore, the mechanism by which pravastatin mediates the reported short-term effects on cardiovascular morbidity is unlikely to lower blood pressure.",0,0

Case report.,,"Schmitt, J K; Koch, K S; Midha, M","We present a 60-year-old C6 fully tetraplegic patient who developed profound hypotension following initiation of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril to control blood pressure. Other causes of hypotension such as myocardial infarction and sepsis were excluded. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was the possible cause of the hypotension. This case demonstrates the critical importance of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis in maintaining blood pressure in tetraplegic patients who are unable to receive input from the brain to sympathetic neurons, and therefore, maintenance of blood pressure. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be avoided in tetraplegic patients unless other treatment modalities have been ineffective.",0,0

To explore this issue, we examined the effects of nitrendipine, a calcium antagonist (NIT, 10-20 mg twice daily) and lisinopril, a converting enzyme inhibitor (LIS, 10-20 mg daily), on blood pressure (office BP, 24). h ambulatory BP), acute sodium load excretion (200 mmol/2 h iv), glomerular filtration rate (insulin clearance), cumulative dopamine excretion, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and endothelin excretion in 8 patients with post-cardiac CAD over 6 weeks transplantation in a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial. Five patients received a fixed dose of a diuretic during the trial. Office diastolic BP (DBP) was significantly decreased from 97 +/- 6 to 87 +/- 9 mmHg with LIS and from 96 +/- 7 to 92 +/- 12 mmHg with NIT.

Cumulative sodium excretion 6 hours after acute sodium challenge increased to 52 +/- 39 mmol (placebo), 96 +/- 44 mmol (LIS, P < 0.05 vs placebo), and 71 +/- 34 mmol (NIT) rose. Glomerular filtration rate, cumulative dopamine excretion, ANP and endothelin excretion did not differ between the two treatment groups. We conclude: (1) both drugs were similar in reducing office BP and during the day, but NIT tended to be more effective during the night; and (2) cumulative sodium excretion during LIS was significantly increased compared to placebo. There was a similar trend during the NIT. Thus, it is possible that chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, and possibly calcium antagonists, improve sodium retention in CAD regardless of differences in blood pressure, ANP, dopamine, or kidney function.",0,0

Chronic inhibition of ACE activity was dose dependent and the maximum reduction in Ang II occurred with quinapril 20 mg.day-1. While most of these changes were reasonably correlated, the humoral changes seemed more evaluable than the hemodynamic changes. The effects of chronic ACE inhibition on circulating neurohumoral components in patients with moderate heart failure are small and dose-dependent.

Twelve patients completed two parts of the study; blood pressure, plasma converting enzyme activity; plasma angiotensin II and noradrenaline concentrations; excretion of metabolites of renal and systemic prostanoids; The draining effect of the first and second morning dose of Enalapril only persisted throughout the day; In the extended study, it took 24 hours because of the build-up of the drug. Converting enzyme inhibitors attenuate bradykinin degradation and thus increase bradykinin-mediated prostaglandin E2 synthesis. Evidence of such a prostaglandin E2-mediated contribution to ventricular emptying was found by enalapril blocked by salicylate. However, the contribution was small and variable, and the addition of salicylate had no significant unloading effects on average throughout the day. Evacuation was abolished in only three of 20 patients in the short-term study and one in 12 in the extended study. At night, when the other effects of enalapril on blood pressure were reduced and the bradykinin-induced effect persisted, the salicylate significantly reduced the residual minor knock-out effect. No effect of salicylate addition on remodeling reversal was seen. Enalapril reduced angiotensin II-induced synthesis of systemic and renal prostaglandin I2 and thromboxane A2 initially only during the day but then at night. Thus, it masked the suppression of thromboxane A2 synthesis by salicylate, the effect attributed to prevention of re-infarction by salicylate; In patients with heart failure, the risk of salicylate significantly reducing the benefit of enalapril by emptying the ventricle is low. Like other effects induced by bradykinin, significant de-emptying occurs in only a small percentage of patients. However, salicylate in the presence of enalapril probably will not be as effective as expected in reducing the risk of re-infarction, as enalapril effectively reduces thromboxane A2 synthesis in patients with heart failure who already have it and no further reduction by salicylate is found.",0,0

Venous compliance was not different between the two borderline hypertensive groups and was only slightly lower than in controls. Large artery compliance was examined using a non-invasive ultrasound vessel wall motion detector system, while venous compliance was determined via strain gauge plethysmography. Borderline hypertensive subjects were then treated with enalapril 10 mg/day, felodipine 5 mg/day, or placebo for six months. Despite similar reductions in blood pressure, enalapril caused a significant increase in muscular femoral and brachial artery compliance, but not in the elastic carotid artery, whereas felodipine did not affect large artery compliance at all in the sodium-sensitive group. The effect of enalapril on muscular artery compliance was determined by a dose-related increase in distension, not a change in artery diameter. Arterial compliance was not affected by any of the drugs in the resistant group. Venous compliance did not change with the drug either. In conclusion, femoral and brachial artery compliance, which was found to be lower in sodium-sensitive borderline hypertensive subjects compared to sodium-resistant subjects, improved with antihypertensive treatment with enalapril, but not with felodipine despite similar decreases in blood pressure.

Mean arterial pressure decreased by 8.6 +/- 0.42 mm Hg. Two years after discontinuing enalapril, the 7 patients receiving enalapril had no change in sodium, potassium, or creatinine levels or mean arterial pressures. Urine albumin concentration increased from pretreatment levels in 2 subjects, returned to pretreatment levels in 2 subjects, and remained below 30 mg/L in 2 subjects; Our results show that enalapril reduces albuminuria in patients with sickle cell anemia. However, after discontinuation of the drug, albuminuria may rise to pretreatment levels or higher. Whether reduction in urinary albumin concentration by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can delay the development of progressive renal failure in sickle cell anemia patients has not yet been determined.",0,0

Each patient was then given either captopril (25 mg twice daily for 1 week) or placebo in a double-blind randomized fashion before reclamping. At baseline, plasma ET-1 levels were 0.77 +/- 0.25 pg/mL in captopril (n = 10) and 0.83 +/- 0.3 pg/mL in placebo patients (n = 5). Two-fold increases in plasma ET-1 levels occurred during the 2-hour infusion of insulin in both groups (P < .05 after 60 and 120 minutes), with a rapid return to baseline 30 minutes after insulin discontinuation. After 1 week of treatment, total glucose uptake was significantly increased in captopril (3.71 +/- 1.70 mg/kg/min to 4.24 +/- 1.72 mg/kg/min, P < .03), but not in placebo patients. Plasma ET-1 levels were significantly reduced after captopril treatment (0.48 +/-0.25 pg/mL at time, P < .03 v pre-treatment levels), but were unaffected by placebo.

This article will help the consultation/liaison psychiatrist recognize early evidence of water imbalance, define assessment, and provide somatic and behavioral treatment approaches to this life-threatening syndrome; Over the past decade, the authors have treated more than 100 patients with polydipsia-hyponatremia syndrome. The authors discuss their own and others' experiences with drugs that help and inhibit patients suffering from dilutional hyponatremia. They review recent key articles from the polydipsia-hyponatremia syndrome literature, including articles identified through a Medline search 1985-94; Schizophrenia with polydipsia-hyponatremia syndrome most commonly present with polydipsia, polyuria, urinary incontinence, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral changes, seizures, or coma.

This study determined that by treating each hypertensive patient sequentially with six antihypertensive drugs, one from each major class, the best possible drug for the control of hypertension could be decided. In a randomized, open-label crossover study, sequentially atenolol, captopril, clonidine, indapamide, prazosin, and verapamil were administered to 19 patients (16 males and 3 females) aged 28–70 years with a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 95–110 mm Hg. Each drug was started at the minimum recommended dose or lower and, if well tolerated, titrated upwards every 2 weeks until blood pressure was controlled (diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg). If the blood pressure was under control, the drug was continued for 2 more weeks. A washout period of at least 2 weeks was allowed between drugs. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced with all six drugs. In 18 of 19 patients, blood pressure was controlled with at least one of the six drugs, often with the lowest dose. The authors concluded that if hypertension cannot be controlled with the lowest recommended dose of one drug, other antihypertensive drugs should be tried in sequence rather than increasing the dose or adding a second drug.",0,0

While such an effect may be useful in the treatment of hypertension or congestive heart failure in diabetic patients, it may also precipitate severe hypoglycemia. To test this hypothesis, we performed a nested case-control study using data from the Dutch PHARMO system (1986-92) among diabetic patients admitted to hospital with hypoglycemia and treated with insulin or oral antidiabetic drugs. We identified 94 patients presenting with hypoglycemia and selected 654 controls from the same cohort. When adjusting for a wide range of potential confounding factors, hypoglycemia was significantly associated with current use of ACE inhibitors (odds ratio 2.8 [95% CI 1.4–5.7]). Among both insulin users and users of oral antidiabetic drugs, use of ACE inhibitors was significantly associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for hypoglycemia (2.8 [1.2-6.4] and 4.1 [1.4-12.2], respectively). Although ACE inhibitors have many advantages over other antihypertensive drugs in diabetes, the risk of hypoglycemia must be considered. Since 13.8% of all hospital admissions due to hypoglycemia can be attributed to the use of ACE inhibitors, further investigation of the mechanism is needed.",0,0

Results of the SOLVD echocardiography substudy.,,"Greenberg, B; Quinones, M A; Koilpillai, C; Limacher, M; Shindler, D; Benedict, C; Shelton, B","Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) studies have shown that enalapril therapy significantly improves the clinical course of patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. The objectives of this substudy were to evaluate changes in LV structure and function in patients with SOLVD and to test the hypothesis that enalapril inhibits remodeling in patients with LV dysfunction; Patients entering both the prevention and treatment arms of SOLVD from 5 of 23 clinical centers were recruited for this substudy. The 301 participating patients underwent Doppler-echocardiographic evaluation according to the standard protocol before they were randomized to enalapril or placebo and after 4 and 12 months of treatment. The recorded data were analyzed in a blinded manner in a central core laboratory. Analysis of baseline clinical characteristics showed that patients enrolled in the substudy represented the overall SOLVD population, but prevention arm patients were slightly overrepresented in the substudy group (69.8% compared to 61.9% of the remaining SOLVD patients). The enalapril group showed significant reductions in the mitral annular E-wave-A-wave velocity ratio (mainly due to a decrease in E-wave velocity) and this response was different from that seen in the placebo group (P = .030). Changes in the E-to-A ratio in the enalapril group were significantly associated with changes in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (r = .56; P < or = .01). LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes increased in placebo, but not in enalapril-treated patients, and differences in response between treatment groups were significant (P = .025 and .019, respectively). LV mass tended to increase in placebo patients and decrease in enalapril-treated patients, and the difference in response between groups was highly significant (P < or = .001). These data suggest that enalapril attenuates progressive increases in LV dilatation and hypertrophy in patients with LV dysfunction. The results support the possibility that the positive effects of enalapril reported in the SOLVD trials are related to inhibition of LV remodeling.",0,0

1431,7751416,Dosing of antihypertensive drugs in patients with renal impairment.,,"Carter, B L","The use of antihypertensive agents in patients with renal impairment requires careful consideration of dosage, titration, and monitoring. For antihypertensives exhibiting extensive renal elimination, renal function should be estimated to make appropriate dose adjustments. Thiazide diuretics are helpful in mild renal impairment, but loop diuretics become necessary as renal function worsens. In both classes, low doses should be used to prevent hypovolemia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia that can worsen renal blood flow. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have become popular because they may have unique renal protective properties. All ACE inhibitors, except fosinopril, require reduced doses and/or less frequent administration in patients with renal impairment. It is usually necessary to use a diuretic containing an ACE inhibitor, and special dosing considerations are important. Because of the demographic and physiological characteristics of patients with renal failure, beta-blockers are generally used in patients with other beta-blocker indications, such as ischemic heart disease. A few beta-blockers are eliminated mainly by the kidney and dosage reduction is necessary for these agents. Calcium antagonists may also have renal protective effects. Since calcium antagonists are extensively metabolized, no significant dose adjustments are necessary. Data suggest that antihypertensives may slow the decline in renal failure. The pharmacokinetics of several antihypertensives are altered by renal impairment due to reduced elimination. Therefore, dosage adjustments, slower titration, and less frequent administration are often required.",0,0
1432,7751417,"Selected aspects of ACE inhibitor therapy for patients with kidney disease: effect on proteinuria, lipids and potassium.",,"Keilani, T; Schlueter, W; Batlle, D","Overt proteinuria is often accompanied by hypercholesterolemia and is associated with increased lipoprotein(a) levels. These lipid abnormalities play a role in the high incidence of macrovascular complications, possibly associated with diabetic nephropathy and possibly other forms of nondiabetic proteinuric kidney disease. Many studies over the past decade have shown that ACE inhibitors can reduce urinary protein excretion, but little attention has been paid to the effect of this form of therapeutic intervention on the lipid profile. In this article, we review our recent data showing that fosinopril administration is associated with significant reductions in both urinary protein excretion, serum total cholesterol levels, and plasma lp(a) levels. The use of ACE inhibitors in patients with renal insufficiency may result in the development of hyperkalemia as a result of suppression of angiotensin II-dependent aldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland. Inhibition of aldosterone secretion may depend on the degree of inhibition of angiotensin II formation in the circulation and also locally in the adrenal gland. Since various ACE inhibitors exhibit varying degrees of ACE inhibition at the tissue level, we hypothesized that angiotensin II-dependent aldosterone production would be inhibited to a lesser degree by agents with low tissue affinity for the adrenal gland. The meaning of this theoretical concept for the development of hyperkalemia in patients with impaired renal function treated with ACE inhibitors is discussed.",0,0

Fosinopril was administered at a dose of 10 mg once daily for 14 days. Results in the two groups were similar and there was no evidence of fosinoprilat accumulation in patients with hepatic impairment. Mean (+/- SD) maximum observed plasma concentrations of fosinoprilat in healthy volunteers were 112.0 +/- 67.2 ng/mL after the first dose and 144.1 +/- 61.7 ng/mL at steady state. The corresponding values for patients with hepatic impairment were 111.4 +/- 40.1 ng/mL and 140.2 +/- 50.9 ng/mL. The area under the serum concentration versus time curve for healthy volunteers was 790.7 +/- 431.0 ng.hr/mL after the first dose and 940.3 +/- 400.4 ng.hr/mL at steady state. Similar values were noted in patients with hepatic impairment: 926.0 +/- 293.9 ng.hr/mL and 1.255.4 +/- 434.0 ng.hr/mL for first dose and steady state, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the pharmacokinetic values of fosinoprilat between healthy and hepatic impaired subjects. The absence of accumulation may be attributable to the dual elimination pathway of fosinoprilat reported in previous studies. Renal excretion of fosinoprilat prevents increased accumulation in patients with hepatic impairment. Current findings suggest that the starting dose of fosinopril used in hypertensive patients with normal kidney and liver function can also be used in patients with cirrhotic liver failure.",0,0

However, fractional albumin clearance was not significantly different from normal in either of the hypertensive groups, neither at BL nor after 1 year of treatment. Therefore, it is possible to reduce BP and increase renal function to levels not significantly different from normal in primary hypertension after treatment with felodipine in combination with beta-blockade. Although this regimen slightly increased low BAE, fractional albumin clearance changed less and was not significantly different from normal. The ramipril/beta-blocker combination reduced BP to a lesser extent and did not alter mildly reduced renal function or BAE.",0,0

To test the hypothesis that basal renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) activity impairs the acute natriuretic response to frusemide in patients with mild or moderate congestive heart failure (CHF), we studied eight adult volunteers with preserved renal function, stable New York Heart. Association Class II or III CHF and echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction due to myocardial infarction, hypertension, or both. 2. All patients received three dose regimens administered in random order: (a) intravenous frusemide: 40 mg bolus followed by 40 mg h-1 over 3 hours, (b) captopril: two 12.5 mg oral doses 2 hours apart, (c) combined dosing : first dose of captopril arrived 30 minutes before bolus of frusemide. The sodium balance in the 80 mmol day-1 sodium diet was documented prior to each dosing regimen. Sodium excretion was measured in urine collected at intervals up to 3.5 hours after initiation of drug administration. During this time, urine output was replaced with an equivalent volume of 0.45% saline intravenously. 3. Captopril significantly decreased plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and plasma aldosterone concentration and increased inulin clearance. The drug had essentially no effect on the time course of the natriuretic effect of frusemide. Maximum fractional sodium excretion during frusemide infused on its own and in combination with captopril was 24.7% +/- 1.9% and 28.2% +/- 3.8%, respectively (difference 3.5%; 95% CI, -4.0 to 11.0%; P > 0.05). .

Captopril and Thrombolysis Study Investigators.,,"Pinto, Y M; van Gilst, W H; Kingma, J H; Schunkert, H","This study sought to determine whether patients homozygous for the deletion (D)-type allele of the angiotensin converting enzyme gene show increased ventricular dilation after myocardial infarction; Recent evidence suggests that the deletion type allele of the angiotensin converting enzyme gene (DD genotype) is associated with an increased prevalence of myocardial infarction and myocardial hypertrophy. However, it is unknown whether the DD genotype is associated with adverse cardiac remodeling. To address this question, we determined the genotype in patients enrolled in the Captopril and Thrombolysis Trial (CATS), a prospective trial in which patients received captopril or placebo during and after thrombolysis for their first anterior myocardial infarction; Cardiac volume was determined by echocardiography immediately after thrombolysis and at 1-year follow-up. The genotype of the angiotensin converting enzyme was determined in 96 patients. Norepinephrine levels were assessed during and immediately after thrombolysis; Immediately after thrombolysis, cardiac volume did not differ between genotype groups. However, at 1-year follow-up, both end-systolic and end-diastolic left ventricular volumes were significantly higher in the DD genotype group. Norepinephrine increased to higher levels in the DD genotype group receiving placebo treatment. Captopril treatment effectively blunted both norepinephrine increase and cardiac dilation in the DD-genotype group; This exploratory study suggests that homozygosity for the angiotensin converting enzyme deletion type allele is associated with increased neurohumoral activation as well as increased cardiac dilation after acute anterior myocardial infarction, an effect that may be susceptible to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.",0,0
1443,7759839,Hypertension and the vasculature: arterioles and myogenic response.,,"Izzard, A S; Heagerty, A M","This editorial was invited by the Journal of Hypertension as one of a series designed to examine our current knowledge of various aspects of hypertension pathophysiology. This article considers small arteries and arterioles; The conclusion that established hypertension is characterized by a normal cardiac output and an elevated peripheral resistance represents an integration of findings from hemodynamic studies using a variety of disease models studied by several different techniques. In some ways, it assumes that all vascular beds fit the same responsive pattern. However, this may not be the case given the obvious heterogeneity of functions performed by specific tissues, recognized variations in receptor populations, and differences in innervation found in the vascular wall throughout the circulation. Resistance to blood flow occurs throughout the vascular tree, but the majority is at the level of the arterioles. Upstream small arteries show changes in growth and remodeling that cause lumen narrowing, but the precise contribution of such vessels to resistance is still unknown. Perhaps the most interesting recent finding in this context is that, despite the demonstration of such structural changes in small arteries, blood pressure can drop soon after a pressure stimulus is removed. In addition, some whole-animal studies have been reported that failed to show the expected vascular amplification when the circulation was under total stress; Viewing the vascular tree as an integrated circuit with specialized functions while feeding specific tissues suggests that when resistance in a vascular bed increases due to the threat of a constriction, it may not be representative of circulation as a whole: indeed, resistance may decrease elsewhere. Structural changes in small arteries are likely to be a result of hypertension. The pathogenesis of hypertension may take place downstream in arterioles, where a myogenic response may play a fundamental role.",0,0

SOLVD Inspectors.,,"Benedict, C R; Francis, G S; Shelton, B; Johnstone, D E; Kubo, S H; Kirlin, P; Nicklas, J; Liang, C S; Konstam, M A; Greenberg, B","The aim of this study was to compare the long-term effects of treatment with enalapril or placebo on plasma neurohormones in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. High neurohormonal levels are associated with increased mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. Numerous studies have shown that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce mortality and morbidity in these patients. In the Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) Studies, enalapril significantly reduced mortality in patients with symptomatic LV dysfunction (treatment trial). In contrast, in patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction (prevention trial), there was no significant reduction in mortality with enalapril treatment. The effect of enalapril was studied in 333 prevention trial and 129 treatment trial patients. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) and plasma renin activity were measured in these patients at baseline and at 4 and 12 months follow-up. In a subset of these patients, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and arginine vasopressin were also measured. Analysis of covariance patterns was used to determine the effect of enalapril on each neurohormone. Participants in the treatment trial had significantly higher neurohormonal levels compared to subjects in the prevention trial or normal control subjects. In the treatment trial, patients who received enalapril had a greater reduction in plasma NE than those who received placebo (p < 0.08).",0,0

1451,7774515,ramipril. An updated review of its therapeutic use in essential hypertension and heart failure.,,"Frampton, J E; Peters, D H","Ramipril is a second generation angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Like enalapril, it is a prodrug and is hydrolyzed in vivo to release the active metabolite ramiprilat, which has a long elimination half-life allowing once-daily administration. The antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril has been confirmed in more tightly controlled clinical trials as well as in large-scale non-comparative studies conducted in general practice. In the former, approximately 85% of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension successfully responded to treatment with ramipril 2.5 or 5 mg daily, whereas comparative studies show that the antihypertensive efficacy of the drug is equivalent to that of other established ACE inhibitors and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol. As expected, patients with severe hypertension have a lower response rate (approximately 40%) to ramipril monotherapy, although the blood pressure lowering effect can be enhanced by the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide or pyretanide. The antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril is maintained in patients with diabetes mellitus, and preliminary data indicate that the drug has a beneficial effect in reducing urinary albumin excretion in diabetic patients with nephropathy. Ramipril is superior to atenolol in causing regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, but the clinical significance of this effect per se has not yet been established. The large-scale Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) study showed that ramipril 5 or 10 mg/day significantly reduced the risk of all-cause death by 27%, even if transient, in patients with clinical evidence of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. The beneficial effect of ramipril appeared after 30 days of treatment and was greatest in patients with more severe post-infarction ventricular injury. Ramipril is well tolerated in general practice and 5% or less patients discontinue treatment due to drug intolerance. Available data suggest that ramipril shares a similar tolerability profile to other established ACE inhibitors. Therefore, clinical data confirm ramipril as a useful alternative ACE inhibitor for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension and demonstrate a beneficial effect of the drug in patients with clinical evidence of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. It is also reasonable to assume that ramipril will be of value in the treatment of patients with more established heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.",0,0

After 2 months, the mean hematocrit (Ht) decreased from 0.57 (range 0.52-0.62) to 0.45 (0.34-0.49). Ena was stopped and after a period of 3.8 +/- 0.3 months, Ht rose again to baseline values (0.56, range 0.52-0.61) in 8 of these. These 8 patients were then given 5 mg/day Ena. Ht decreased more slowly and reached a mean of 0.49 (0.44-0.54) after 3 months. Group 2 (9 patients) received 600 mg Theo daily in 2 doses. After 2 months, Ht decreased from 0.56 (0.52-0.61) to 0.52 (0.46-0.63), but remained above 0.51 in 5 patients. After 1 month of discontinuation of treatment, PTE persisted in 7 patients. These patients were given 10 mg/day Ena, after which Ht was changed from 0.55 (0.52-0.64) to 0.46 (0.40-0.53) after 2 months and 0.41 after 3 months. It fell to (0.33-0.47).

1454,7781377,Acute myocardial infarction. Then and now.,,"Simmons, J; Willens, H J; Kessler, K M","Dramatic changes have occurred in the management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) over the past decade. While previous management strategies were primarily supportive, current strategies focus on restoring and maintaining patency of the infarct-related artery, restoring blood flow to compromised myocytes, preserving left ventricular function and promoting healing, as well as preventing recurrences and complications. Restoration of blood flow can be achieved pharmacologically with thrombolytic agents or mechanically with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Early use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants helps maintain patency of infarct-related arteries and prevents thromboembolic complications. Administration of beta-blockers and angiotensin enzyme inhibitors are more specific ways of protecting the myocardium and preserving ventricular function. In addition, various strategies to prevent arrhythmias, such as the prophylactic use of lidocaine and the routine long-term suppression of premature ventricular contractions with antiarrhythmic drugs, are no longer routinely advocated. Basically, in the era before the eighth decade of this century, the primary aspect of therapeutic strategy for AMI was to reduce the oxygen demand in the infarcted myocardium; in subsequent years the emphasis shifts to improvement in oxygen delivery through thrombolysis, PTCA, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. These interventional changes, added to greater complexity in the use of drugs to reduce oxygen demands, resulted in significantly lower myocardial mortality.",0,0

Pretreatment with indomethacin resulted in a reduction in the acute increase in cardiac output and reduction in systemic vascular resistance induced by captopril. Similarly, an increase in renal blood flow with captopril was reduced with indomethacin; The acute side effects of indomethacin on central and peripheral hemodynamics and kidney function suggest that prostaglandins have an important role in the regulation of peripheral blood flow and renal function in patients with stable chronic heart failure. The attenuation of captopril by indomethacin, induced improvements in hemodynamic function and renal blood flow are consistent with the hypothesis that captopril may act in part through an increase in prostaglandin synthesis.",0,0

To this end, 30 patients (22 women and eight men) aged 47+/-2 years with mild to moderate essential hypertension were treated with enalapril maleate (MK 421, an ACE inhibitor) for six weeks. M-mode and Doppler echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography were performed at the beginning and after six weeks of enalapril treatment. In this study, all patients treated with the ACE inhibitor enalapril responded with a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure (p < 0.001). After six weeks of treatment with enalapril, a significant reduction in left ventricle and mass index was demonstrated (p < 0.01). Total peripheral resistance and end-systolic stress decreased in the same time period (p < 0.001). After six weeks of treatment with enalapril, ejection fraction increased at both examinations, but this increase was not statistically significant. In radionuclide studies, the time to peak filling rate was significantly reduced (p < 0.02) after six weeks of treatment with enalapril. Despite these improvements in cardiac systolic and diastolic parameters, cardiac output and stroke volume were slightly reduced after treatment with enalapril. We conclude that enalapril improves diastolic and systolic parameters in LV function, but causes slight decreases in cardiac output and stroke volume, as well as lowering blood pressure.",0,0

Secondary endpoints include total cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Entry criteria include a continuous sitting systolic blood pressure of 160 to 219 mm Hg and a sitting diastolic pressure of 95 to 109 mm Hg. A standing systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg is also required. Patients should give informed consent and should not have congestive heart failure, gout, kidney failure, or a recent cerebral hemorrhage requiring treatment. Patients will be randomized into 3 groups – (i) no treatment; (ii) treatment with a diuretic [bendroflumethiazide (bendrofluazide)]; or (iii) treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril). The starting dose for bendroflumethiazide and lisinopril is 2.5 mg daily. A doubling of the dosage is allowed to achieve the target of sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures (< 150/80 mm Hg). In addition, slow-release diltiazem (from 120 mg/day to 240 mg/day, if necessary) can be added to the drug therapy of actively treated groups.

Although no systematic experimental studies or controlled clinical observations exist, lithium is known to activate the renin-angiotensin system through a variety of mechanisms. In addition, direct interactions between lithium and angiotensin II can occur at the cellular level.

There are many types of drug reactions, including predictable drug reactions such as side effects, toxicity, drug interactions, and secondary effects that can be expected when planning treatment. There are also a number of unpredictable side effects with unexpected consequences of treatment. The least severe, unpredictable adverse drug reaction is intolerance, which appears to be an exaggeration of the pharmacological or toxic effects of the drug among sensitive patient subgroups. Some of the most severe and life-threatening adverse drug reactions are allergic. These side effects may be mediated by a number of mechanisms, including drug-specific IgE development, serum-disease-like reactions in response to drug-antibody complexes, direct release of inflammatory mediators, or involvement of the immune system by these mechanisms. poorly understood. Distinctive adverse drug reactions are a heterogeneous group of adverse reactions that cannot be predicted from the pharmacological effects of the drug. Most of these reactions occur as a result of pharmacogenetic variations in drug bioactivation and drug or metabolite detoxification or clearance. The physician should be alert to the possibility of unpredictable adverse drug reactions during or after treatment. Currently ongoing research may provide an opportunity to predict and hopefully prevent some of these adverse reactions in the future.",0,0

Enalapril increased LV fractional shortening (FS%) (13.3 +/- 5.6 to 15.4 +/- 5.8, p < 0.05) and decreased the systolic time interval index (0.58 +/- 0.14 to 0.48 +/- 0.15, p < 0.05) Concurrent with a significant reduction in angiotensin converting enzyme activity and concentrations of aldosterone, angiotensin-II and norepinephrine after 6 weeks. No changes were found in the placebo group. However, there was no direct correlation between the amount of change in neurohormones and improvement in LV function after 6 weeks. These findings suggest that in patients with severe chronic CHF, severe LV systolic dysfunction is associated with elevated plasma angiotensin-II and norepinephrine levels, which can be favorably modified by enalapril. This may be important for prolonging life in severe heart failure. The lack of relationship between changes in individual hormones and systolic function suggests a complex dynamic interaction. Therefore, it is not sufficient to predict changes in LV function simply by measuring changes in a hormone.",0,0

Therefore, hemodynamic effects and adverse events during antihypertensive therapy were studied in 146 patients receiving lisinopril (20 mg once daily) and 147 patients receiving slow-release nifedipine (20 mg twice daily) who entered the six-week treatment period. One patient from the lisinopril and two patients from the nifedipine groups were excluded from the efficacy analysis because their supine DBP was < 95 mmHg after exercise. Undesirable effects were mostly transient during the initial treatment period and discontinuation of nifedipine therapy occurred in six (4.1%) and three (2.1%) patients and in 12 (8.2%; NS) and three (2.0%) patients in the lisinopril group. group respectively. After the six-week treatment period, the lisinopril group showed nonresponders (supine DBP > or =95 mmHg) in 19 of the remaining 142 patients, and the nifedipine group showed non-responders in 20 of the remaining 142 patients. Initial supine and standing heart rates were similar in both groups. While supine heart rate decreased significantly in the lisinopril group, standing heart rate did not change significantly with treatment in supine and standing heart rates in this group and nifedipine group. Thus, lisinopril has proven to be as effective and safe as nifedipine with response rates of 86.6% and 85.9%, respectively.",0,0

Information about this patient was obtained through review of the medical picture, interview with the attending physician, and personal involvement later in the patient's treatment. We have conducted MEDLINE and PAPERCHASE searches of English language literature (limited to human studies) from 1976 to the present, manually searching for Current Content and references in each reviewed publication, and contacted the lisinopril manufacturer for any further references they could provide; All case reports describing ACE inhibitor overdose; Case reports were evaluated for the relevant ACE inhibitor, ingestion, and therapeutic management; Ten patients with ACE inhibitor overdose have been reported, most of whom only needed intravenous fluids for blood pressure support. The case presented here is the second report that the patient's blood pressure was not adequately controlled with fluids and conventional vasopressors and required an angiotensin II infusion; Although only a few cases of ACE inhibitor overdose have been reported, it is likely that overdose will become a more common problem with the widespread use of these agents. Treatment of ACE inhibitor overdose should include general supportive care, bowel decontamination if possible, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors if needed. Intravenous angiotensin II may be effective in cases where conventional vasopressors have failed and is a physiologically rational therapy.",0,0

Qualifying patients (n = 51) received placebo, 25 or 100 mg of losartan, or 20 mg of enalapril. Blood pressure, plasma drug concentrations, and mediators of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were measured on 4 inpatient days: end of placebo exercise, after first dose, and 2 and 6 weeks of treatment. Plasma drug concentrations were similar after the first and last doses of losartan. At week 6, losartan 100 mg and enalapril 20 mg showed comparable antihypertensive activity. Four hours after dosing, 100 mg losartan increased plasma renin activity 1.7-fold and Ang II 2.5-fold, while enalapril increased plasma renin activity 2.8-fold and decreased Ang II by 77%, compared to the day of habituation. Both drugs decreased the plasma aldosterone concentration. For losartan, increases in plasma renin activity and Ang II were greater at week 2 than at week 6. The effects of losartan were dose dependent. After the last dose of losartan, changes in plasma renin activity and Ang II were similar to changes in placebo at 36 hours. These results suggest that prolonged blockade of the feedback Ang II receptor in hypertensive patients produces moderate increases in plasma renin activity and Ang II that do not affect the antihypertensive response to the antagonist.",0,0

Calcium channel or converting enzyme blockade?,,"van der Schaaf, M R; HenÃ©, R J; Floor, M; Blankestijn, P J; Koomans, H A","We compared the effects of 4-week calcium channel blockade (amlodipine) or converting enzyme inhibition (lisinopril) on blood pressure and renal hemodynamics in a group of 20 kidney transplant patients treated with hypertensive cyclosporine. Amlodipine (10 mg) was more effective in controlling hypertension than the same dose of lisinopril (mean 24-hour arterial pressure 111 +/- 9 and 115 +/- 9 mm Hg, respectively; P < .05). Blood pressure was lower than placebo during both treatments (124 +/-12 mm Hg, P < .05).

Renal hemodynamics did not change during lisinopril. Both drugs had no effect on proteinuria. Data show that amlodipine is more effective than lisinopril in controlling hypertension in patients treated with cyclosporine, and treatment with amlodipine but not lisinopril is accompanied by an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, and a decrease in renal vascular resistance. The data suggest that the renin-angiotensin system does not play a fundamental role in determining cyclosporine-related changes in renal hemodynamics and has a limited role in determining cyclosporine-associated hypertension.",0,0

Because urinary albumin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase excretion reflect the renal effects of hypertension, they are associated with blood pressure, other cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac target organ effects, and response to treatment in mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure). 99mmHg). Participants were from two clinics of the Mild Hypertension Treatment Trial (TOMHS), a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Participants received nutritional-hygienic therapy and one of five active drugs or placebo. Urine albumin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase excretion were evaluated prospectively using office ""spot"" collections from one clinic (n = 213) and retrospectively using overnight collections from the other clinic (n = 210). Relationships between protein excretion and blood pressure, age, sex, race, blood glucose, cholesterol concentrations and body mass indexes, and left ventricular mass and baseline function were determined. Treatment effects were evaluated after 3 to 12 months. Spot and nocturnal albumin excretion are positively correlated with baseline systolic blood pressure by univariate analyses. Spot albumin excretion was positively associated with systolic blood pressure, age, creatinine clearance, and left ventricular function, whereas overnight albumin excretion was positively associated with left ventricular mass and female gender by multiple regression analyses. Spot, but not overnight, albumin excretion was significantly reduced with active drug therapy. N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase excretion was not associated with reductions in blood pressure or treatment. The combined results show that albumin excretion is associated with blood pressure, decreased with antihypertensive drug therapy, and associated with greater left ventricular function and mass, as well as glomerular filtration rate, even at mild hypertension levels.",0,0

As a result of this methodological limitation, no data are available on the effects of long-term antihypertensive therapy on global arterial impedance characteristics and indices of myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). Using recently validated non-invasive techniques, we compared the effects of chronic oral treatment with ramipril, nifedipine and atenolol on arterial impedance and mechanical power loss, as well as MVO2 indices in hypertensive patients; Sixteen African-American subjects with systemic hypertension were studied in a randomized, double-blind, crossover protocol. The instantaneous central aortic pressure and flow from which arterial load characteristics can be derived were estimated from calibrated subclavian pulse traces (SPTs) and continuous-wave aortic Doppler velocity, respectively, in conjunction with two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic measurements of the aortic annulus. . Left ventricular short (M-mode) and long axis (2D echo) images were taken simultaneously with SPTs to obtain ventricular wall stress and MVO2 indices. Data were collected at the end of the 2-week washout period (drug pre-control) and after 6 weeks of treatment with each agent. Although all three agents reduced diastolic blood pressure to the same extent, different effects were noted on mean and systolic pressures and vascular impedance characteristics. Nifedipine reduced total peripheral resistance (TPR; 1744 +/- 398 vs. 1290 +/- 215 dynes/cm5) and increased arterial compliance (ACL; 1.234 +/- 0.253 vs. 1.776 +/- 0.415 mL/mm) Hg). This improvement in arterial compliance was not fully explained by the reduction in swelling pressure. Ramipril also decreased TPR (1437 +/- 290 vs. 1740 +/-292 dyne-s/cm5) and increased ACL (1,569 +/- 0.424 mL/mm Hg vs. 1,214 +/- 0.190) , however, the reduction in arterial compliance with this agent was explained solely on the basis of a reduction in bulging pressure. Atenolol, in contrast, did not affect TPR or ACL. Consistent with the concordance results, nifedipine and ramipril significantly reduced the first two harmonics of the impedance spectrum, but atenolol did not. None of these substances caused a significant change in the characteristic impedance or relative amplitude of the reflected pressure wave. The percentage of total vascular mechanical power and oscillatory power remained unchanged with all antihypertensive treatments. Ramipril and nifedipine alone reduced the integral of both meridian and peripheral systolic wall stresses; this indicates decreased MVO2 per beat with these agents. The stress-time index, a measure of MVO2 per unit time, was significantly reduced with ramipril but not nifedipine as there was an increase in heart rate in 10 of 16 patients (mean increase, 10 beats per minute). Thus, a decrease in MVO2 coupled with unchanged total vascular mechanical force indicates increased efficiency of ventriculoarterial coupling with ramipril and nifedipine in the subset of patients in whom heart rate was not changed. In contrast, there was no evidence of a reduction in wall tension, voltage integral, or voltage-time index with atenolol; The noninvasive methodology used in this study constitutes a new tool for the serial and simultaneous assessment of arterial hemodynamics and left ventricular energy in systemic hypertension. In this study, we show the differential effects of chronic antihypertensive treatments on systemic arterial circulation and MVO2 indices in African-American subjects. Considering the different drug-induced responses of arterial load and the MVO2 indices with each drug may provide a more physiological approach to the treatment of individual systemic hypertension.",0,0

We report efficacy, treatment side effects, biochemical responses, and incidence of hypoglycemia in 755 patients (mean age 57 years, blood pressure 150/94 mmHg) followed for 2 years. At 2 years, blood pressure was 143/84 in the tight control group and 156/90 mmHg in the less tight control group (p < 0.0001). Blood pressure reduction, adherence to treatment, incidence of adverse events and hypoglycemia were similar in captopril and atenolol. There was a greater increase in body weight (+2.3 vs +0.7 kg, p < 0.01) in patients receiving atenolol and a nonsignificant trend for a greater increase in triglycerides compared to patients receiving captopril. Captopril and atenolol had similar hypotensive effects, while a large blood pressure difference was obtained between the tight control and less tight control groups. The study has the potential to determine whether tight blood pressure control reduces the incidence of diabetic complications and whether ACE inhibitor or beta blocker therapy is clinically advantageous.",0,0

1499,7857732,Association between decreased heart rate variability and left ventricular dilatation in patients with first anterior myocardial infarction. CATS Inspectors. Captopril and Thrombolysis Study.,,"Dambrink, J H; Tuininga, Y S; van Gilst, W H; Peels, K H; Lie, K I; Kingma, J H","Decreased heart rate variability has been identified as an important prognostic factor after myocardial infarction. This factor is thought to reflect the imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, which can lead to unfavorable loading conditions and thus promote left ventricular dilatation; In a multicenter clinical trial, 298 patients were randomized to captopril or placebo after their first anterior myocardial infarction. All patients were treated with streptokinase before randomization. In the current sub-study, complete data, including heart rate variability and echocardiographic measurements, were available from 80 patients. Patients were divided into two groups: those with a low (< or = 25) heart rate variability index and those with a normal heart rate variability index (> 25). Heart rate variability was assessed with 24-hour Holter monitoring before discharge. Left ventricular volumes were evaluated by echocardiography before discharge and at three and 12 months after myocardial infarction. The extent of myocardial damage, severity of coronary artery disease, functional class, hemodynamic variables, and drug therapy were also considered as possible predictors of left ventricular dilatation; Pre-discharge systolic and end-diastolic volumes were not different in the two groups. In patients with reduced heart rate variability, systolic volume (mean (SD)) increased by 6 (14) ml/m2 (P = 0.043) and end-diastolic volume increased by 8 (17) ml/m2 (P = 0.024) after 12 months. Left ventricular volumes did not change in patients with normal heart rate variability. Also, patients with left ventricular dilatation had a larger enzymatic infarct size and higher heart rates and rate-pressure products. A low heart rate variability index before discharge was an independent risk factor for left ventricular dilatation during follow-up. Measurement of heart rate variability after three months had no predictive value for this event; Evaluation of the heart rate variability index before discharge, but not at three months, provided important additional information for identifying patients at risk for left ventricular enlargement.",0,0

After 24 hours of treatment with 2.5 mg and 5 mg ramipril, a higher plasma concentration of this peptide was found with a given pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The plasma concentration of the active metabolite, the change in arginine vasopressin concentration, or the degree of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition did not significantly predict the change in plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide or the ratio of atrial natriuretic peptide concentration to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; With a given pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, a gradual increase in the plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide occurs during short-term high inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme. Causal mechanisms have not yet been identified. Such a change in the relationship between central hemodynamics and atrial natriuretic peptide concentration may contribute to the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in patients with congestive heart failure due to ischemic heart disease.",0,0

Patient population with essential hypertension. Participating physicians followed normal office procedures for initiation of quinapril therapy (a dose of 10 mg QD in most cases). Dose was titrated according to blood pressure response, usually at 2-week intervals, for a maintenance dose of 10 mg to 20 mg QD QD in most cases (86% at 6 months) and not exceeding QD. The use of concomitant antihypertensive drugs is left to the discretion of the physician. By random assignment, physicians obtained patient-informed consent, either on a detailed form listing possible quinapril side effects, or on a less specific form not listing specific side effects. The purpose of using the two different forms was to evaluate the possible relationship between the frequency of adverse event reporting and the patient's awareness of the side effects of quinapril. Patients were also given an education package that provided general information on lifestyle changes known to reduce hypertension and cardiovascular risk factors. An intent-to-treat analysis included data from 3742 patients with a median age of 56 years and a median duration of hypertension of 5 years. The demographics of these patients were similar to those described in Canadian hypertensive patients in a recent population-based survey. Approximately 80% of ACCEPT study patients had more than one cardiovascular risk factor in addition to hypertension. Of the 2979 patients who received quinapril at 3 months, 77% stabilized. Of the 2517 patients who continued to take quinapril at 6 months, 84% stabilized. Patients who continued to take quinapril as part of their antihypertensive regimen had greater reductions in both diastolic and systolic blood pressures than those who discontinued quinapril therapy. Blood pressure responses to quinapril were similar in newly diagnosed patients and those with a history of hypertension. A total of 980 patients (26.2%) reported one or more adverse events. Cough was the most frequently reported and was considered to be strictly related to quinapril treatment by the treating physician in 3.6% of cases.

Patients received either enalapril (20 mg) or paired placebo daily for 2 weeks, in random order. Forearm blood flow response to increasing doses of angiotensin II was measured using venous occlusion plethysmography at the beginning of the study and at the end of each 2-week treatment period. Treatment with enalapril significantly reduced plasma angiotensin II levels and supine blood pressure compared to placebo. The percent reduction in forearm blood flow in the infused arm in response to the maximum dose of angiotensin II (50 pmol.min-1) was 53.2% at baseline, 51.4% in placebo, and 59.5% in enalapril.

Blood pressure, serum chemistry, sodium excretion, plasma renin and serum aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels were measured at baseline, after acute sodium depletion, and after chronic high sodium intake with and without enalapril. Effective renal plasma flow was measured by paraaminohippurate clearance in the higher sodium state before and during intravenous infusion of angiotensin II at 3 ng/kg/min. This was to test whether renal blood flow would decrease less in patients with ADPKD, similar to unmodulated essential hypertension. The groups were comparable at baseline, except for the higher supine mean arterial pressure in the ADPKD group (median 91 vs. 81 mm Hg, P = 0.002). There were no significant differences in blood pressure or hormonal response to sodium depletion between ADPKD and control subjects.

After a drug-free washout phase, they received placebo, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN 20 mg twice daily), captopril 12.5 mg twice daily, and a combination of both for 1 week, followed by exercise tolerance, blood pressure, and heart rate (supine, standing, and 24-hour profile) and peripheral arterial vasodilation (finger pulse plethysmography) were evaluated.; Thirty-three patients completed all phases of the study. 17 patients developed exercise-related anginal symptoms, and 16 other men developed asymptomatic ischemia. Compared with ISDN, the anti-ischemic effects of captopril were minimal, although there was a similar reduction in blood pressure. Compared to baseline, 1-week placebo reduced the main efficacy parameter, the sum of ST-segment depression by 10% (NS), captopril by 19% (NS), ISDN by 37% (P < 0.001) and the combination of the following. captopril and ISDN 42% (P < 0.001; ISDN vs NS).

Resting blood pressure was reduced 9-10% systolic (P < 0.001) and up to 7% diastolic (P < 0.001) with monotherapy at peak effect and 18% systolic (P < 0.001) during combined treatment with captopril and ISDN. ) and 12% diastolic (P < 0.001). Significantly enhanced circulatory effects of captopril plus ISDN versus ISDN were found for blood pressure (P < 0.001) and peripheral arterial vasodilation (P < 0.01). Reflex tachycardia caused by ISDN in an upright position (5 beats/min) was not blocked by captopril during the combined therapy; Despite significant circulatory effects after short-term administration, the antianginal and anti-ischemic effects of captopril alone were marginal. Although captopril in combination with ISDN resulted in another significant blood pressure lowering effect and increased peripheral arterial vasodilation, the magnitude of the potentiation of the anti-ischemic nitrate effects was, by contrast, small. Exercise-only angina was further improved with the use of the combination. No paradoxical worsening of ischemia or angina was observed after captopril.

In the case of acute MI, the coronary care units currently used are quite expensive but can be made much more efficient with more efficient triage and resource use; Reperfusion by thrombolysis, such as beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, after MI is cost-effective in eligible patients. The cost-effectiveness of CAD screening tests is largely dependent on the prevalence of the disease in the population studied. The cost-effectiveness of CABG surgery depends on targeting; for example, it is highly effective for conditions such as left main and three vessel disease, but not for less disease. PTCA appears to be cost-effective in situations where there is clinical consensus for its use, eg severe ischemia and single vessel disease, but requires further analysis based on randomized data; coronary stents also appear to be cost effective. In the preliminary analysis, ACE inhibition predominates for CHF, meaning it saves both money and lives. Cardiac transplantation appears to be cost-effective but requires more work. For arrhythmias, implantable cardioverter defibrillators are cost-effective in life-threatening situations, especially the transvenous device; Radiofrequency ablation is cost-effective in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome as well as in asymptomatic individuals; and pacemakers were not analyzed except in the case of biofascicular block, where results were variable depending on the condition and prior testing.",0,0

They were randomly divided into two groups. The cup was given at a dose of 37.5-75 mg/day and Nad 40-80 mg/day per os. The results show that both drugs increase the volume of blood delivered to the kidneys from cardiac output (renal blood flow/cardiac output), Cap by 10% (P < 0.05) and Nad by 8% (P < 0.05). Renal vascular resistance (RVR) is reduced by the two drugs, 13% (P < 0.05) with Cap and 11% (P < 0.05) with Nad. These suggest that both drugs facilitate the maintenance of renal blood circulation in patients with essential hypertension and are useful for the long-term treatment of hypertension.",0,0

Hunter Hypertension Research Group.,,,"Doxazosin, a once-daily alpha-blocking drug, has been shown to reduce both blood pressure and hyperlipidemia, associated risk factors for early vascular disease. This study was designed to see if a low-fat diet modifies the beneficial effect of doxazosin on blood lipids in adults with mild to moderate hypertension and mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia (5.6-8.0 mmol/l). After a six-week period on a low-fat diet, patients were randomly assigned to additional 10 weeks of treatment with doxazosin (2-8 mg/day) or enalapril (5-20 mg/day). Of the 55 subjects, 44 completed the study. A low-fat diet reduced average body weight by 2 kg without significantly altering blood lipids (total and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides). Doxazosin (4.5 +/- 2.9 mg/day) and enalapril (12.5 +/- 6.5 mg/day) provided comparable blood pressure reduction in sitting and standing at all visits, and also provided similar 24-hour BP control. The expected increase in the previously noted HDL cholesterol concentration was not associated with doxazosin therapy in this patient population, suggesting that a low-cholesterol-high-carbohydrate diet at least acutely attenuates this potentially beneficial effect on plasma lipids. In summary, doxazosin has comparable tolerability and blood pressure lowering ability to enalapril. However, the ability to increase HDL cholesterol may be reduced in patients on low-fat diets.",0,0

To examine the role of the renin-angiotensin system in hypertension in the elderly, we evaluated the antihypertensive response to enalapril and TCV-116, an angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonist, in elderly patients with essential hypertension. A single oral dose of enalapril (10 mg) increases plasma renin activity (PRA) and decreases angiotensin II concentration, while a single oral dose of TCV-116 (4 mg) increases both PRA and angiotensin II concentration. Blood pressure was significantly lowered by these drugs 4 hours after administration. Baseline PRA and angiotensin II levels decreased with age. However, the changes in blood pressure produced by TCV-116 or enalapril were not age-related.

1543,7917078,Side effects of alpha 1-adrenergic blocking drugs.,,"Carruthers, S G","Previous non-selective alpha 1-adrenergic blocking drugs such as phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine are now limited to the pharmacological management of alpha 1-adrenergic crisis and pheochromocytoma. Prazosin, the first selective alpha 1-blocker approved for the treatment of hypertension, hit the market in the mid-1970s. Additional alpha 1-blockers such as doxazosin and terazosin have been introduced in recent years. The undesirable effects of all members of this class are similar. Most adverse events are attributable to reversible competitive antagonism of postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in tissues that maintain high levels of alpha-adrenergic sympathetic tone, eg, resistance arteries, capacitance vessels, and urinary bladder outflow tract. Orthostatic hypotension with intense fainting and occasional syncope may occur shortly after the first dose. Aggravating factors include upright posture, intravascular volume depletion, and concomitant administration of other blood pressure lowering drugs, including all other classes of antihypertensive drugs. The problem is reduced or avoided by choosing low starting doses, starting treatment at bedtime, and minimizing other risks. Among the common adverse events, asthenia, dizziness, fainting, and syncope predominate, occurring in 10% to 20% of patients, leading to discontinuation of treatment in about half of this number. Infrequent adverse events include headache, drowsiness, palpitations, urinary incontinence, and priapism. Some patients experience 1 to 2 kg of body weight gain, which may be associated with secondary hyperaldosteronism. Tolerance appears to improve for the benefits of alpha 1-blockade in patients with congestive heart failure, but not hypertension.",0,0

All antihypertensive agents equally reduced baseline mean arterial pressure and did not change forearm vascular resistance compared to placebo. In response to sustained grip exercise, both quinapril and verapamil, but not atenolol, attenuated the pressure response. However, verapamil was associated with an exaggerated increase in forearm vascular resistance during grip, while quinapril did not alter this response compared to placebo. It was concluded that quinapril and verapamil attenuate the compression response during isometric exercise with quantitatively different effects on the vasoconstrictor response in as well as outside of the skeletal muscle.",0,0

The patient was non-smoker and had no respiratory disease. Cough persisted during treatment with Quinapril. One month after switching to fosinopril treatment, the patient reported that the cough had completely resolved. So far he has been freed from cough; Cough caused by ACE inhibitors is an often documented side effect. It is severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in 1-10% of patients. Cough is considered a class-related adverse event with cross-reactions between ACE inhibitors routinely reported. Switching to another ACE inhibitor or additional treatment with NSAIDs is not recommended at this time. Discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor will cause the cough to subside rapidly, but this is not always necessary because most patients may experience a cessation or reduction in coughing. We present a case of cough in a patient with essential hypertension that resolved completely following administration of quinapril after switching to the alternative ACE inhibitor fosinopril; Cough has been commonly encountered after administration of ACE inhibitors. The frequency of cough is variable and although this complication has been described as a class effect, patients with persistent, severe ACE inhibitor-induced cough may benefit from a trial of fosinopril therapy. This may be particularly useful in patients who cannot tolerate an alternative class of antihypertensive agents.",0,0

Seventy-four of the original 127 patients treated with atenolol met the entry criteria for the 4-week, double-blind phase of the study; during this phase, benazepril 10 mg twice daily (increased to 20 mg if needed after 1 week) or placebo was added to atenolol. At the endpoint, 46% of the benazepril group achieved an excellent or good response (ie, a decrease in diastolic blood pressure [DBP] < 90 mm Hg or > or = 10 mm Hg below baseline). placebo group (P < 0.01). The mean decrease in DBP at the endpoint was -5.6 mm Hg in the benazepril group and -3.7 mm Hg in the placebo group. The difference in DBP response between the benazepril group and the placebo group was not statistically significant, as six patients in the benazepril group experienced an increase in blood pressure that offset the decrease observed in responders. We conclude that the addition of benazepril to the regimen of patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled while on atenolol monotherapy may result in an additional reduction in blood pressure in almost half of the patients.",0,0

The aim of this study was to identify predictors of recurrent MI in study participants and to examine the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on these and other myocardial ischemic events; 2231 patients survived the acute phase (3 to 16 days) of MI and had a radionuclide ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%. Patients were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with placebo or captopril and were followed for a mean of 42 months. The effect of captopril on recurrent MI, cardiac revascularization procedures, and hospitalization with unstable angina was studied. Patients with index preinfarction and higher systolic pressure (all P < .001) or with functional disability were more likely to have recurrent MI, but were not affected by baseline left ventricular ejection fraction. Captopril treatment reduced the risk of developing recurrent MI by 25% (95% CI, 5% to 40%; P = .015) and the risk of death after recurrent MI by 32% (95% CI, 4%). up to 51%; P = .029). Patients given captopril were less likely to require cardiac revascularization procedures (P = .010), but hospitalization for unstable angina did not change. When all three of these major coronary ischemic events are considered together, captopril therapy reduced the risk (14% risk reduction; 95% confidence interval, 0% to 26%; P = .047).; In post-MI patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, long-term administration of captopril reduced MI recurrence and the need for cardiac revascularization, but did not affect the rate of hospitalization for unstable angina. The finding that MI recurrence is independent of left ventricular ejection fraction suggests that captopril may be useful in preventing recurrent MI in patients with better preserved left ventricular function. Patients receiving long-term captopril therapy had a reduced need for cardiac revascularization, suggesting either an anti-ischemic effect or the ability of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor to modify the atherosclerotic process in MI survivors.",1,1

Results of the Captopril and Thrombolysis Study (CATS).,,"Kingma, J H; van Gilst, W H; Peels, C H; Dambrink, J H; Verheugt, F W; Wielenga, R P","The study was designed to examine the safety and efficacy of acute interventional use of captopril on left ventricular volumes, ventricular arrhythmias, and neurohormones during thrombolysis in patients with a first anterior myocardial infarction within 6 hours of symptom onset. Left ventricular dysfunction and prognosis after myocardial infarction can be improved by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition initiated after the ischemic phase. Experimental evidence suggests that intervention during thrombolysis may lead to greater benefit. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 298 patients with a first anterior myocardial infarction who were eligible for thrombolytic therapy were treated with captopril 6.25 mg or placebo, started immediately after the streptokinase infusion and titrated to 25 mg daily. The efficacy of captopril was measured in a therapeutic assay to reduce left ventricular volumes, ventricular arrhythmias, neurohumoral activation, and enzymatic infarct size. Mean blood pressure and heart rate during dose titration were similar in both groups. However, hypotension was reported after the first dose in 18 patients receiving placebo and 31 patients receiving captopril (P < 0.05). At discharge, 80% of patients were on study medication.

This has been demonstrated in studies with ACE inhibitors alongside conventional antihypertensive therapy. Whether the second group of drugs is more effective has not been proven, and this was the purpose of our study. In a prospective randomized study, we compared the effects of ACE inhibition and beta-blockade on delaying the progression of renal function in IDDM patients with early-stage overt diabetic nephropathy. Twenty-nine patients were studied for 2 years, with 15 randomized to captopril and 14 to atenolol treatment. Blood pressure and urinary albumin and total protein excretion were measured every 6 weeks. GFR was measured as 51Cr-EDTA clearance every 6 months. Baseline values for blood pressure, renal function, and albuminuria were the same in the two groups. The effect of both drugs on blood pressure was not significantly different.

The reason for this may be the use of different doses of ACE inhibitors, different kidney pathology and non-standardized sodium intake. The efficacy of increasing doses of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril was studied in 16 proteinuric patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy with normal renal function and blood pressure maintained at a controlled sodium intake < or = 80 mEqII. Lisinopril doses were 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg administered over 4 weeks. A 3-week placebo period was added between each dose increase. Proteinuria was reduced by 39%, 44%, 61% and 67% from the control period with lisinopril at 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg, respectively.

Early treatment with enalapril may be beneficial, as the renin-angiotensin system may be activated in chronic aortic regurgitation.

Both regimens not only produced a significant reduction in left ventricular mean wall stress, but also a slight increase in exercise duration. In contrast to hydralazine treatment, only enalapril treatment produced a significant inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. In addition, the multiple r2 value obtained from the analysis of the end-diastolic volume index using two variables such as age and therapeutic drugs was 72.1% (p < 0.01). Both regimens reduce left ventricular mean wall stress. Enalapril therapy produces significant left ventricular mass regression, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume index reduction, and suppression of the renin-angiotensin system.

Results of a randomized, double-blind study with parallel groups.",,"Haenni, A; Andersson, P E; Lind, L; Berne, C; Lithell, H","randomized, double-blind study with parallel groups investigated the metabolic effects of lisinopril and bendrofluazide treatment in 61 patients with essential hypertension. Insulin sensitivity index as measured by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp test decreased by 22% (P < .01) during bendrofluazide treatment and by 15% (NS) during lisinopril treatment. In the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), baseline insulin response increased by 21% (P < .05) during lisinopril treatment, decreased by 13% (P < .05) during treatment with bendrofluazide, and also the rate of glucose loss was decreased by 9% (P < .05) in the second group. . During the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), the area under the glucose curve (AUCglucose) increased by 17% (P = .05) in the bendrofluazide-treated group and decreased by 19% (P = .05) in the lisinopril group, with AUC not associated with drug effects on insulin. although there is no difference. LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio increased during bendrofluazid treatment. Serum potassium concentration decreased by 10% (P = .0001) during bendrofluazide treatment, but increased by 6% (P = .0001) in the lisinopril-treated group. The change in serum potassium was inversely proportional to the change in initial insulin response and rate of glucose loss in IVGTT and change in AUCglucose in OGTT. Consequently, changes in serum potassium balance may affect initial insulin release and glucose excretion. Bendrofluazide therapy reduces serum potassium concentration, reduces initial insulin release and glucose excretion, and also impairs insulin sensitivity. Lisinopril treatment increases serum potassium concentration and initial insulin response and decreases AUCglucose, but does not by itself improve insulin sensitivity.",0,0

So far, no studies have allowed a true comparison of these drugs in this context and for their circadian blood pressure lowering potential. Therefore, a total of 86 patients with newly diagnosed arterial hypertension and echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy received randomized treatment with captopril (n = 43) or nitrendipine (n = 43). Eighteen patients had to receive nitrendipine and captopril combination therapy during the study period to effectively control blood pressure. Before and after the 6th and 38th weeks of treatment, all patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, M-mode echo evaluation of left ventricular mass, and Doppler evaluation of left ventricular filling. 24-hour blood pressure data were corrected with a Fourier series and then compared with a normotensive reference profile for blood pressure burden and variability. Day and night averages and office blood pressure were also analyzed. Substance-specific effect profiles were obtained by subtracting the flattened profiles after treatment from the profiles before treatment. After 38 weeks ambulatory blood pressure on nitrendipine from 152 +/- 11/101 +/- 7 to 137 +/- 13/87 +/- 10 mm Hg and 147 +/- 11/99 +/- 6 has fallen. 134 +/- 13/89 +/- 9 mm Hg on captopril. The calculated substance-specific profiles for captopril and nitrendipine showed a balanced antihypertensive effect during the day and night. The mean percent reduction in left ventricular muscle mass under nitrendipine was 15% and was not significantly different from the 21% reduction under captopril treatment (p < 0.001). There is no significant relationship between the decrease in blood pressure and the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. In patients with impaired left ventricular diastolic function, the early-to-late diastolic left ventricular flow rate and isovolumetric relaxation time improved regardless of the drug used. It was concluded that long-term treatment with captopril and nitrendipine resulted in comparable circadian blood pressure reduction and regression of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy.",0,0

Prior to these 16 weeks, there was a 2-6 week placebo washout period. Blood pressure measurements, euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps, and intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) were performed at baseline and after 4 and 16 weeks. Blood lipid status was assessed at baseline and at 16 weeks. The insulin sensitivity index (M/I) increased by 12% during the prolonged placebo period and then decreased by 12% during treatment with atenolol in this group. A post-hoc analysis of covariance showed that the increase in insulin sensitivity during the first 4 weeks may be due to the ongoing effects of previous antihypertensive therapy. Fosinopril increased glucose loss at weeks 4 and 16 during IVGTT (k values 1.46 and 1.33 versus 1.10 at baseline), but had no effect on insulin sensitivity. The change in insulin sensitivity and serum triglycerides during treatment with fosinopril was associated with inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme in serum. In conclusion, the ongoing effects of previous antihypertensive drugs were noted in this study, possibly due to insufficient washout time in many patients. Therefore, a 4-week placebo washout is recommended for all patients in such studies.",0,0

Capsaicin challenge was performed before and 2 hours after dosing with either 75 mg of captopril or orally matched placebo, and 20, 40, and 60 minutes after iv administration of 1 mg of glycopyrrolate to each subject. Captopril and placebo did not change cough response compared to baseline. However, glycopyrrolate caused a significant increase in threshold sensitivity (D2) from baseline and a significant decrease in overall cough response at 40 and 60 minutes after both captopril and placebo. D2-baseline and D2-40 minutes after glycopyrrolate (mean SD) were 3.2 (1.0); 17.9 (4.2) and 2.5 (8.5) after placebo; 23.6 (6.9) after captopril. Elimination of vagal effects means weakening of the effects of tachykinins, but not those of prostaglandins. We hypothesize that tachykinins, such as substance P, play a more important role than prostaglandins in capsaicin-induced cough. We conclude that the vagus is important in the capsaicin-induced cough reflex, but since suppression of this reflex by glycopyrrolate is delayed, the relevant receptors are located either in poorly accessible peripheral receptors or in the central nervous system.",0,0

II [3H-ANG(1-8)] in graded doses of 0.5, 2.0, and 2.5 ng/kg/min in 5 anesthetized, unanesthetized female dogs. Infusion of 3H-ANG-(1-8) had no significant effect on mean arterial pressure, glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, or urine flow rate.

Despite significant increases in renal arterial 3H-ANG(1-8) concentrations, no or only trace amounts of 3H-ANG(1-8) were detected in the urine. These observations suggest that urinary ANG(1-8) is derived de novo from intrarenal angiotensin II formation. In addition, plasma and urine concentrations of ANG(1-8) were evaluated in patients with essential hypertension treated with a diuretic (n = 14) or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 14). Although plasma ANG(1-8) concentrations responded appropriately to the respective treatments, urinary excretion of ANG(1-8) was not different after either treatment.

Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone (PA) values remained low before and during enalapril treatment. Temporary treatment with sodium polystyrene sulfate after discontinuation of enalapril improved hyperkalemia and renal function, but lower PRA and PA levels.

In vitro tests of lymphocyte susceptibility to drugs are considered to have low sensitivity. To increase the sensitivity of the in vitro assay, we explored the possibility of detecting lymphocyte reactivity to drugs in drug-induced hepatitis by analyzing lymphocyte proliferative responses to drug or metabolite antigens ex-vivo. Lymphocyte proliferative responses to five different concentrations of the drug and to ex-vivo drug antigens (serum collected from normal subjects after taking the drugs) were analyzed in 25 patients, 27 healthy subjects, and 10 patients with a clinical diagnosis of drug-induced hepatitis. People who have been recently exposed to the same drugs without developing adverse drug reactions. Lymphocyte reactivity to drugs was detected in 7 of 25 patients (28%). Using serum collected from healthy volunteers after drug ingestion (ex-vivo drug antigens) and adding a prostaglandin inhibitor to the cultures allowed detection of lymphocyte sensitivity in seven additional cases, increasing detection ability from 28% to 56%. We propose that the use of ex-vivo drug antigens can make an important contribution to the identification of drug involved in cases of drug-induced hepatitis.",0,0

We investigated whether the ACE inhibitor zofenopril administered six weeks after anterior myocardial infarction could improve both short-term and long-term outcomes; A total of 1556 patients were enrolled within 24 hours of the onset of acute anterior myocardial infarction symptoms and were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (784 patients) or zofenopril (772 patients) for six weeks. At this time, we evaluated the incidence of death or severe congestive heart failure. Patients were reexamined one year later to assess survival; The incidence of death or severe congestive heart failure at six weeks was significantly reduced in the zofenopril group (55 patients, 7.1 percent) compared to the placebo group (83 patients, 10.6 percent); The cumulative reduction in risk of death or severe congestive heart failure was 34 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 8 to 54 percent; P = 0.018). The reduction in risk was 46 percent for severe congestive heart failure (95 percent confidence interval, 11 to 71 percent; P = 0.018) and 25 percent for death (95 percent confidence interval, -11 to 60 percent; P = 0.19). After one year of observation, the mortality rate in the zofenopril group (10.0 percent) was significantly lower than in the placebo group (14.1 percent); The reduction in risk was 29 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 51 percent; P = 0.011).; Treatment with zofenopril significantly improved both short-term and long-term outcomes when this drug was started within 24 hours of the onset of acute anterior myocardial infarction and continued for six weeks.",1,1

Diuretics are associated with cholesterol levels (regression coefficient = 0.13 mmol/L; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.18 mmol/L), higher at higher doses (additive effect of higher dose, 0.12 mmol/L; CI , 0.04 to 0.20) caused relative increases. mmol/L) and worse in blacks than non-blacks (additional effect in blacks, 0.13 mmol/L; CI, 0.01 to 0.26 mmol/L). Beta-blockers resulted in increases in triglyceride levels (0.35 mmol/L; CI, 0.31 to 0.39 mmol/L), which were significantly smaller for agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (improved beta-blocker increase, -0.21 mmol/L; CI, - 0.27 to -0.16 mmol/L). When combined with cardioselectivity, beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity favorably affected lipids and reduced both total (-0.14 mmol/L; GA, -0.24 to -0.04 mmol/L) and LDL cholesterol levels (-0.17 mmol/L; CI, - 0.28 to -0.07 mmol/L). alpha-blockers reduce total cholesterol (-0.23 mmol/L; CI, -0.28 to -0.18 mmol/L), LDL cholesterol (-0.20 mmol/L; CI, -0.25 to 0.15 mmol/L), triglycerides (-0.07 mmol/L).

However, it is unknown whether aspirin can alter blood pressure values in treated or untreated hypertensive patients, as has been described for other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. So 30 patients. 10 with mild uncomplicated and untreated essential hypertension, 10 with essential hypertension under chronic treatment with captopril, 10 with essential hypertension under chronic treatment with 50 mg twice daily and atenolol, 100 mg oid, aspirin, 100 mg oid and received a corresponding placebo. one month, according to the double-blind random cross design. At the end of each treatment, blood pressure, heart rate, serum thromboxane B2 produced, and urinary thromboxane B2 and 6 keto prostaglandin F1 alpha excretion and plasma renin activity were measured. In both treated and untreated essential hypertensive patients, aspirin administration did not affect blood pressure, heart rate, and urinary 6 keto prostaglandin F1 alpha, but significantly decreased thromboxane B2 excretion and plasma renin activity in serum and urine. In conclusion, available data confirm that low-dose aspirin selectively inhibits thromboxane B2 synthesis, while suggesting that 100 mg oid aspirin can be administered to treated and untreated essential hypertensive patients without any detrimental effects on blood pressure values.",0,0

Evaluation by acute renin and converting enzyme inhibition.,,"Kiowski, W; Beermann, J; Rickenbacher, P; Haemmerli, R; Thomas, M; Burkart, F; Meinertz, T","The contribution of non-angiotensinergic effects of converting enzyme inhibitors to the hemodynamic effects in patients with chronic heart failure is unclear. Comparing the effects of renin and converting enzyme inhibition will help clarify this issue; Thirty-six patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class II or III) were randomly assigned to receive a concomitant infusion of double-blind intravenous placebo, the renin inhibitor remikiren, or the converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat followed by a second placebo infusion. adding remikiren to enalaprilat or adding enalaprilat to remikiren, respectively. Systemic hemodynamics (Swan-Ganz and radial artery catheters) were measured before (rest and submaximal recumbent bicycle ergometry), during (rest and exercise), and at the end (rest and exercise) of each 45-minute single or combination infusion period. Placebo did not alter hemodynamics or renin activity. Effective inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by remikiren and enalaprilat was demonstrated by increases in plasma immunoreactive renin with rapid and complete inhibition of renin activity after remikiren and an increase (all P < or = .05) after enalaprilat. Remikiren and enalaprilat rapidly and to a similar extent reduced resting blood pressure through reduction of systemic vascular resistance, and these changes were significantly associated with baseline plasma renin activity. Both compounds reduced pulmonary artery, pulmonary capillary wedge, and right atrial pressures to a similar extent (P < .05). Pulmonary capillary wedge and right atrial pressures decreased equally with remikiren and enalaprilat during exercise, and the stroke volume index increased (P < .05 for both). The combination of converting enzyme with renin inhibition or vice versa did not cause additional hemodynamic changes; Specific inhibition of renin in patients with chronic heart failure produces short-term hemodynamic effects almost indistinguishable from conversion enzyme inhibition. This finding and the lack of additive effects of converting enzyme inhibition added to renin inhibition suggest that the non-angiotensinergic effects of converting enzyme inhibitors do not play a significant role in their short-term hemodynamic effects in patients with chronic heart failure.",0,0

Comparative effects of ACE inhibition and calcium channel blockade.",,"London, G M; Pannier, B; Guerin, A P; Marchais, S J; Safar, M E; Cuche, J L","We wanted to evaluate the relevant roles of antihypertensive and BP-independent effects of antihypertensive drugs on arterial hemodynamics and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients; In a double-blind study, 24 ESRD patients with LVH were randomized to receive either the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril (n=14) or the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine (n=10) for 12 months. Repeated measurements of the following parameters were made: BP (mercury blood pressure measurement), left ventricular mass (LVM, echocardiography), cardiac output (aortic cross-section and velocity integral), total peripheral resistance (cardiac output and mean BP), aortic and great-artery compliance ( pulse wave velocity, Doppler flowmeter) and arterial wave reflections (magnification index, applanation tonometry). Radioimmunoassay was used to determine plasma renin activity, aldosterone and plasma catecholamine levels. Two-way (time-treatment) ANOVA for repeated measures was used for statistical analysis. Perindopril and nitrendipine caused significant and similar reductions in BP, total peripheral resistance (P < .001), aortic and arterial pulse wave velocities (P < .001), and arterial wave reflections (P < .01). At baseline, the two groups had LVH, mostly due to increased LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) (perindopril, 54.3 +/- 1.4 and nitrendipine, 54.3 +/2.4 mm) and near-normal mean LV wall thickness (perindopril, 11.4 +). /- 0.3 and nitrendipine, 11.2 +/- 0.4 mm). A reduction in LVM was observed in patients receiving perindopril alone (from 317 +/- 18 to 247 +/- 21 g) (time-treatment interaction, P = .036). Nitrendipine had no significant effect on LVM (314 +/- 29 vs. 286 +/- 32 g). The reduction in LVC observed with perindopril was associated with a reduction in LVEDD (54.3 +/- 1.4 mm vs 49.9 +/- 1.6 after 12 months) (time-treatment interaction, P = .04), mean LV wall thickness was unchanged (11.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 10.5 +/- 0.5 mm). Cardiac changes were not correlated with changes in BP or changes in plasma renin activity or aldosterone or catecholamine levels; In ESRD patients with LVH, ACE inhibition reduces LVM independent of its antihypertensive effect and associated changes in arterial hemodynamics. The reduction in LVK was primarily due to reduction in LV volume, which may be due to chronic volume overload in these patients.",0,0

However, adverse skin reactions such as angioneurotic edema have been reported following such drugs. In addition, these drugs have been associated with persistent dry cough in people without prior known bronchial hyper-reactivity. There is reason to believe that ACE inhibitor-induced cough is caused by an irritating inflammatory condition in the airways of susceptible individuals and that it may have pathophysiological features in common with cough, which is seen as an early symptom of asthma. All inflammatory responses - swell and flare reactions, airway reactivity and infiltration by neutrophils and eosinophils - were increased in a dose-dependent manner by ACE inhibitors. Other ACE inhibitors may have different proinflammatory profiles.",0,0
1594,7995312,Comparison of lisinopril and nifedipine in the treatment of mild and moderate hypertension. A multicenter study.,,"Rogstad, B","Lisinopril was compared to slow-release nifedipine in a 16-week double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study involving 102 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced by 6 and 5 mmHg more with lisinopril than with nifedipine in 12 weeks of monotherapy. After 12 weeks, a greater proportion of patients receiving lisinopril (sitting diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg) were controlled than those receiving nifedipine. As a result, 17% of those receiving lisinopril and 38% of those receiving nifedipine required additional treatment with hydrochlorothiazide. Addition of hydrochlorothiazide resulted in similar response rates in the lisinopril and nifedipine groups (89% and 75%, respectively). The reporting rate and discontinuation rate of adverse events thought to be drug-related were similar for both treatments. Cough was reported more frequently with lisinopril and headache, sweating and hot flashes with nifedipine. We conclude that once-daily titrated doses of lisinopril provide better blood pressure control than twice-daily titrated doses of nifedipine.",0,0

In December 1991, we completed the enrollment of 106 patients. The duration of treatment is two years. Hypertension is treated in all patients with enalapril maleate (Vasotec). We evaluated the associations between various clinical and renal morphological features and renal function at the entry of all enrolled patients. Among 78 men and 28 women [age (mean +/- SD) 36 +/- 14 years], older age at treatment randomization, hypertension, disease discovery and study entry, increased fractional excretion of albumin, increased serum triglyceride levels, and more severe tubulointerstitial , vascular and combined glomerular and tubulointerstitial histological lesions were all univariately associated with worse kidney function as measured by reciprocal serum creatinine and creatinine clearance levels (p < or = 0.01). In a multiple regression analysis used to estimate baseline reciprocal creatinine, the best end model (R2 = 0.48) included male gender (p < .001), hypertension (p = .001), decreased peripheral blood erythrocytes (p = .001) at treatment randomization. , increased tubulointerstitial score (p = .004) and increased fractional albumin excretion (p = .025) as independent predictors of decreased kidney function. These associations are similar to those seen in the high-risk subgroup of patients with IgA nephropathy who develop end-stage renal disease. In the final outcome analysis of the clinical trial, we will examine the effects of treatment on kidney function on two potentially modifiable risk factors, hypertension and proteinuria.",0,0

However, para-aminohippurate clearance in absolute terms significantly exceeded 125I-orthiodohippurate clearance, with a mean (+/- SD) of 24.8 +/- 43.7 ml.min-1 (P < 0.05), so using only prior art was significant. Increased renal perfusion observed in response to converting enzyme inhibition. In the post-myocardial infarction group, the correlations between the two methods were variable and much weaker than in the chronic heart failure group (r = 0.54 on consecutive days, P = 0.01 and r = 0.74, P = 0.002). Also, captopril-mediated increases in effective renal plasma flow were unrelated with the two techniques (r = -0.19, P = 0.59). In this group, 125I-orthiodohippurate elimination significantly exceeded para-aminohippurate clearance (P < 0.05). This inverse relationship and weaker associations between post-infarction modalities compared with chronic heart failure patients may be related to the intervention of thrombolytic or aspirin therapies.",0,0

However, interobserver variation in patients may be more difficult than in normal subjects. In a multicenter study, a total of 331 cycling maximal tests (ramp protocols, 10 watt.min-1) were applied to 85 patients from 10 centers with respiratory gas analysis with different systems. A central committee reviewed all the tests. AT detection percentages range from 34% to 71%, depending on the method used. Other detection methods such as carbon, except the respiratory exchange rate (RER) method, which gives the lowest detection rate at 34%, and the crossover point (when RER=1), which gives the highest rate at 71%. dioxide (42%), minute ventilation (52%), or ventilation equivalents plotted against time (57%) did not differ in the rate of AT detection. Therefore, AT determination was unreliable, even among trained physicians. The crossing point can be a valuable index from a pragmatic point of view, although it appears after the actual AT.

Therefore, it is of interest to study neurohormonal activation during different physiological conditions. Plasma neurohormones were measured in 54 patients treated with diuretics for mild or moderate CHF. Samples were taken at rest and immediately after maximum cycling exercise, before and after 12 weeks of treatment with ramipril or placebo. There was a strong correlation between plasma levels of each hormone before and after exercise. There was an inverse correlation between exercise duration and angiotensin II levels after maximal exercise (r = -0.30, P = 0.03) at baseline, but not at rest. Plasma levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and noradrenaline increased after maximal exercise compared to rest. Plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and ANP were reduced by ramipril compared to placebo both at rest and after exercise, but angiotensin II, aldosterone, and noradrenaline levels were not significantly affected. Therefore, exercise continuously activates neurohormonal systems in patients with CHF. Patients with the lowest exercise duration had the highest angiotensin II levels after exercise. Measurements of plasma neurohormones after maximum exercise provide limited additional value to measurements at rest.",0,0

Mean reductions in pit sitting SBP/DBP with the combination therapy ranged from 7.8 mmHg/7.2 mmHg to 19.6 mmHg/15.1 mmHg (n = 458). The results of the response surface analyzes show that the effects of the two drugs are additive and that the maximum antihypertensive effect of quinapril in combination with HCTZ within the studied doses is approximately achieved at a dose of 26 mg of quinapril and 25 mg of HCTZ. The degree of attenuation of the hypokalemic effect of HCTZ was directly related to the dose of quinapril. At 40 mg of quinapril, HCTZ dose-related serum potassium decreases were not significant and the overall hypokalemic effects were attenuated by quinapril.

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to prevent progressive enlargement of the left ventricle after MI; The effects of captopril were evaluated in 58 patients with post-MI left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo or captopril (50 mg daily) on day 7 in a double-blind parallel study over a 6-month period. The patients were followed up with ambulatory ECG monitoring and echocardiography. In contrast to a significant decrease (P < .05) in the captopril group, there was a significant increase (P < .05) in VA in the placebo group. In conclusion, there was a significant difference between the groups after 6 months (P < .05). In addition, the number of patients without baseline VA presenting with this at study conclusion was 6% in the captopril group versus 38% in the placebo group (P < .05). LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) and LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) were significantly increased (P < .01) in patients with VA at baseline and at study end. Both myocardial ischemia and increase in LVEDVI at day 180 were independent predictors of VA; however, progressive enlargement of the left ventricle was limited to placebo patients who had significant increases in LVEDVI compared to the captopril group: 17% vs. 0%, respectively (P < .01). Also, the duration of ambulatory ST-segment depression was significantly longer in this group compared to the captopril group (P < .01). Left ventricular enlargement and myocardial ischemia predict VA in both acute and chronic phases after MI. In post-MI patients with LV dysfunction, captopril has a beneficial effect on both the number of complex VAs and the number of patients who develop VA during the chronic phase.

After the initial examination 48 to 72 hours after the onset of symptoms, patients were randomly assigned to administer placebo or captopril, and 24-hour Holter monitoring was repeated on the third day. No changes were detected in the time and frequency domain after placebo. After captopril, the SD of all normal RR (NN) intervals (SDNN) was 90 +/- 29 to 105 +/- 30 milliseconds (P < .01); The mean SD of NN intervals for all 5-minute segments (SDANN index) and the average of SDs (SDNN index) of all NN intervals for all 5-minute segments also increased from 74 +/- 24 to 90 +/- by 26 milliseconds, respectively.

The percentage of differences between consecutive mean square difference (r-MSSD) and adjacent NN intervals >50 milliseconds (pNN50) remained unchanged. Regarding frequency domain measures, the total power (ln units) after captopril ranged from 8.28 +/- 0.42 to 8.47 +/- 0.30 (P < .01); Considering the frequency bands, a significant increase was observed in ULF (P < .01), VLF (P < .05) and low frequency (LF) power (P < .05), high frequency (HF) power. remained unchanged.; This study supports the hypothesis that the renin-angiotensin system modulates the amplitude of ULF and VLF power.

Recently, it has been suggested that single low doses (1 mg) but not higher doses (25 mg) increase the diuresis induced by captopril furosemide. It is not known whether the interaction between diuretics and ACE inhibitors changes during prolonged dosing; Eight patients with heart failure treated with diuretics and ACE inhibitors for at least 3 months were studied. All patients received 12.5 mg of captopril three times daily for 2 weeks prior to the study. Sodium intake was stabilized before the study and usual medications were discontinued on study days. Intravenous furosemide was given on each of the 2 study days to maintain a moderate, stable diuresis. Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were determined using clearance techniques, and urine was collected hourly for 4 hours. Captopril 12.5 mg or placebo was given in a randomized, single-blind fashion at the end of the first hour.

Clinical files, chest roentgenograms, computed tomographic scans, respiratory function and bronchoalveolar lavage data were reviewed. Minocycline therapy was given for acne (n = 4), genital infection (n = 3), and Lyme disease (n = 1). The mean duration of treatment was 13 +/- 5 days (mean +/- SE); total dose, 2060 +/- 540 mg.

Chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates in all cases. Pulmonary function was measured in five patients; four had airflow obstruction and two had mild restriction. Blood gas tests showed hypoxemia in seven patients (58 +/- 3 mmHg). Seven patients had blood eosinophilia (1.76 +/- 0.2 x 10(9)/L). Bronchoalveolar lavage (performed in seven patients) showed an increased proportion of eosinophils (0.30 +/- 0.07). Cd4+/CD8+ ratio was determined in four cases and low in three cases. Transbronchial lung biopsy performed in two patients showed interstitial pneumonia in one patient with significant eosinophil infiltration in both patients. The result was positive in all patients. Three patients required steroid therapy because of severe symptoms. No attempt was made to challenge again.

However, 20% of the enalapril group compared to 11% of the amlodipine group required the addition of hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure control (P < 0.01). Diastolic blood pressure returned to normal or decreased by 10 mmHg in 204 (90%) patients receiving amlodipine and 190 (85%) patients receiving enalapril. Side effects were generally mild or of little clinical significance. The main adverse events noted were class specific for ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists, respectively cough (enalapril) and edema (amlodipine). Tolerability was very good, with only 17 patients (8 amlodipine, 4%; 9% enalapril, 4%) withdrawn from the study due to strictly treatment-related adverse events. Amlodipine monotherapy had a slightly beneficial effect on blood lipid concentration and both drugs reduced the calculated 10-year risk of coronary heart disease.

Although its pathogenesis is not fully known, a change in the regulation of erythropoietin production by the local kidneys or renal allograft has been implicated as the main causes. Conventional treatments include repeated phlebotomy, bilateral natural nephrectomies, and anticoagulant therapy. Recently, although not generally accepted, theophylline has been proposed as an effective treatment. In addition, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors played a role in the development of anemia in chronic renal failure and dialysis patients. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of captopril on long-term treatment of PTE. Nineteen renal allograft recipients affected by severe PTE were included in the study. All patients had native kidneys and none had kidney tumors or hydronephrosis. Restrictive criteria for PTE were applied to all patients and other causes of erythrocytosis were rationally excluded. Captopril was administered at a dose of 25 mg/24 hours (12.5 mg twice) for 12 months, with no change in the starting dose during follow-up. After 3 months of captopril treatment and throughout the study period, all patients achieved significant reductions in hematocrit (P < 0.001), hemoglobin (P < 0.001) and RBC count (P < 0.001). Erythropoietin levels decreased significantly over the study period, although values were within the normal range of our laboratory. Captopril was well tolerated and only 1 patient had to discontinue the drug due to dry cough.

A standard anesthesia induction was applied to each patient. If systolic blood pressure (monitored using a radial arterial cannula) fell below 90 mmHg in response to induction, ephedrine was administered; A significant reduction in plasma converting enzyme activity was found in patients who received enalapril until the morning of the surgical procedure, and 100% of these required ephedrine after induction. In patients who received the usual dose of captopril on the morning of surgery, plasma converting enzyme activity was reduced to a lesser extent (compared to patients receiving enalapril). Finally, in patients whose ACEI therapy such as enalapril or captopril was discontinued the evening before surgery, the incidence of induction-induced hypotension was significantly less when enalapril or captopril therapy was discontinued; These data suggest that in hypertensive patients chronically treated with ACEIs, continued therapy up to the day of surgery may increase the likelihood of induction hypotension.",0,0

Any additional cardiovascular risk factor increases the risk of adverse outcomes and may be adversely affected by treatment. JNC-V recommendations for equally effective pharmacological agents are flexible but controversial. The favorable cardioprotective effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, alpha blockers and alpha-beta blockers make them a more suitable choice than diuretics or beta blockers.

1638,8064788,"Clinical pharmacology of converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and diuretics.",,"Sinaiko, A R","The dominant trend in pediatric antihypertensive management is towards increasing dependence on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers because of their overall effectiveness, low incidence of adverse events, and potential specific benefits in patients with kidney disease. The common etiological association between kidney disease and high blood pressure is also the reason why diuretic therapy continues to be included in many treatment regimens. A number of ACE inhibitors are available for clinical use, but only captopril has received any meaningful study in children. Due to a marked antihypertensive effect and increased duration of action in this age group, initial doses of captopril are 0.5 mg/kg in children > 6 months and 0.01-0.1 mg/kg in neonates. Side effects are few and the main side effect is decreased glomerular filtration in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis. Calcium channel blockers reduce cytosolic calcium concentration and are particularly effective in patients with volume-dependent forms of hypertension. The pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs are similar to drug clearance via hepatic metabolism. In particular, nifedipine has a rapid onset of action and is widely used to treat hypertensive emergencies. Despite being used sublingually, the effectiveness of the drug is due to its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Very few side effects of these drugs have been reported in children. Heart rate and cardiac output increase but return to pre-treatment levels within a few weeks. As with ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers appear to have a positive effect on kidney function.",0,0

The treatment goal (satisfactory response) was to reduce sitting diastolic blood pressure to <90 mmHg or <100 mmHg with at least 10 mmHg. At an average daily dose of 16 mg of enalapril and 57 mg of nifedipine-ER, more than three-quarters of each treatment group achieved a satisfactory response. After 22 weeks of treatment, mean reductions in sitting blood pressure levels were 15/11 mmHg for enalapril and 21/13 mmHg for nifedipine-ER. The difference between treatments was significant only for the change in systolic blood pressure (P < 0.05). However, enalapril was better tolerated than nifedipine-ER. The number of patients who had adverse experiences and dropped out due to an adverse experience was significantly lower for enalapril than for nifedipine-ER (P < 0.05). The incidence of abnormal laboratory findings was small and was considered to be of no clinical significance in either group.

In the acute phase, captopril can scavenge free radicals, blunt the catecholamine response, cause coronary vasodilation, and increase prostacyclin and bradykinin levels. In the chronic phase, remodeling may be weakened. Currently, a large number of controlled clinical trials are ongoing, mainly focusing on the effects of ACE inhibition in the chronic phase. Only a few studies focus on the effect of acute intervention with ACE inhibitors in ischemia-reperfusion, ie thrombolysis in myocardial infarction. In the Captopril and Thrombolysis pilot study (CAT pilot study), captopril 3 mg and 6.25 mg were well tolerated as adjunctive therapy to intravenous streptokinase. After 6.25 mg, the reduction in mean arterial blood pressure (36 +/- 11%) was comparable to the control group (30 +/- 7%). In addition, noradrenaline levels decreased dose-dependently to 47 +/- 6 and 38 +/- 7, respectively, from baseline. These results led to a large nationwide trial of acute intervention with captopril in 300 patients receiving thrombolytic therapy: the Captopril and Thrombolysis Trial (CATS). The primary hypothesis of CATS assumes a very early effect of converting enzyme inhibition on the outcome of ischemia-induced myocardial damage and early reperfusion. This will be assessed by serial echocardiography, Holter monitoring, and neurohumoral measurements immediately after thrombolysis and during the first year after myocardial infarction. Blind data show a favorable blood pressure response with systolic hypotension below 100 mm Hg occurring in only 0.2% of patients.",0,0

This sequence in pathophysiology has been shown to be blunted by ACE inhibitors. However, the increase in volume can also be helpful in restoring stroke volume and improving the rise of fill pressures. Also, very early institution of ACE inhibition failed to improve short-term mortality after myocardial infarction in a large trial. Therefore, the aim of the ECCE study was to investigate the early effects of the ACE inhibitor captopril on compromising exercise capacity, which is thought to be the first measurable sign of developing heart failure. The ECCE trial is a randomized, seven-center trial that examined the effects of ACE inhibition on oxygen uptake in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design in a group of 204 patients. Sample size was calculated on the basis of a pilot trial. The study design of 104 patients and first unblinded data are presented. The population consists mostly of male patients with first myocardial infarction. They were hospitalized within five hours of the onset of chest pain. End-diastolic volumes were normal, but ejection fraction was moderately impaired. ACE inhibition was initiated after the first day but within 72 hours of the onset of chest pain.

1667,8125423,The Survival and Ventricular Expansion (SAVE) study: logic and perspective.,,"Pfeffer, M A","Myocardial infarction increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events (eg, heart failure or other myocardial infarction) among survivors compared to the general population. Left ventricular dysfunction is among the main risk factors for such adverse events. Although cardiovascular risk reduction has been achieved with the use of aspirin, beta-blockers (and sometimes revascularization and/or serum lipid-lowering agents), the potential of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to improve outcome in myocardial infarction survivors has only recently been examined. The idea that ACE inhibition might be beneficial for these patients arose from animal studies showing that long-term ACE inhibition therapy reduces left ventricular enlargement. After clinical confirmation of this initial finding, the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial was designed to determine whether long-term ACE inhibition therapy would reduce morbidity and mortality among myocardial infarction survivors. The SAVE study found the following risk reductions between captopril and placebo recipients: death (all-cause) 19% (95% CI, 3% to 35%; p = 0.019); cardiovascular death 21% (95% confidence interval, 5% to 35%; p = 0.014); myocardial infarction 25% (95% confidence interval, 5% to 40%; p = 0.012).

The prognosis of clinically apparent drug hepatotoxicity is relatively serious. The clinical picture is essentially non-specific and has a highly variable latency from days to years. Drug hepatotoxicity can mimic almost any type of liver disease. A comprehensive drug history, a low threshold of suspicion, and exclusion of other causes of liver disease are important for the detection of drug-induced liver disorders. Treatment consists of suspected drug(s), discontinuation of acetylcysteine during paracetamol (acetaminophen) toxicity, and liver transplantation in selected cases of fulminant liver failure. Guidelines for the use of selected drugs such as methotrexate and halothane should be followed. Potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be used with caution in alcoholic patients with or without hepatic involvement. Patients with uncompensated liver disease should receive a lower dose adjusted for the degree of liver dysfunction. The public should be warned against the abuse of hepatotoxic drugs such as paracetamol and anabolic steroids.",0,0

1678,8137599,Clinical pharmacokinetics of ramipril.,,"Meisel, S; Shamiss, A; Rosenthal, T","Ramipril is a long-acting non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor introduced for clinical use about a decade ago. Ramipril is a prodrug that undergoes liver deesterification to form its active metabolite, ramiprilat. Ramipril is rapidly distributed in all tissues; liver, kidneys and lungs show markedly higher concentrations of the drug than in the blood. After absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, rapid hydrolysis of ramipril occurs in the liver. In the therapeutic concentration range, the protein binding of ramipril and ramiprilat is 73% and 56%, respectively. Ramiprilat binds with high affinity to ACE at concentrations similar to that of the enzyme and slowly stabilizes. Although ramipril is metabolized by hepatic and renal mechanisms to both a glucuronate conjugate and a diketopiperazine derivative, most of the drug is excreted in the urine as the glucuronate conjugate of ramiprilat and ramiprilat. Elimination from the body is characterized by a relatively rapid initial phase with a half-life of 7 hours and a late phase with a half-life of approximately 120 hours. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions have been reported between ramipril and other drugs. The drug was generally well tolerated and the most common adverse events were dizziness (3.4%), headache (3.2%), fatigue (1.9%) and nausea (1.7%). Ramipril is an effective and well tolerated drug for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure in all patients, including the elderly and those with renal or hepatic dysfunction.",0,0

This mode of therapy improves survival when added to digitalis and diuretics. We followed 50 patients with severe congestive heart failure using echo-Doppler cardiography for 1 year to evaluate the clinical effect and changes in cardiac size of captopril compared to placebo. After randomization, captopril was started in 25 patients and placebo in 25 patients. At baseline and at 6 and 12 months, each patient underwent exercise tolerance testing, radionuclide angiography to estimate left and right ventricular ejection fraction, M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography, and Doppler cardiograph to calculate cardiac sizes and stroke volumes. Two patients in the captopril group and four patients in the placebo group died during follow-up. Because of clinical deterioration, open-label captopril should be started in nine patients in the placebo group. Treatment with captopril was associated with a more significant improvement in functional class and exercise duration compared to placebo. The forward stroke volume estimated from Doppler echocardiography increased from 47 +/- 3 ml to 55 +/- 3 ml with captopril and decreased from 49 +/- 5 to 44 +/- 4 ml in placebo-treated patients. This improvement was associated with a trend for lower heart rate with captopril. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume tended to increase in the placebo group and remained unchanged in the captopril group. Mitral regurgitation volume, calculated at 6 and 12 months, tended to be lower in patients treated with captopril. Thus, captopril therapy proved effective in patients with severe congestive heart failure and resulted in an increase in advanced stroke volume; may have a beneficial effect on cardiac dimensions and mitral regurgitation.",0,0

In the current clinical study, plasma bradykinin levels were monitored using AN69, cuppropane and polysulfone membranes during the early phase of dialysis in 10 patients not treated with ACE inhibitors. Bradykinin was measured after extraction by radioimmunoassay. During this study, an event of anaphylaxis occurred during dialysis with the AN69 membrane. Blood samples were collected during the first 5 minutes of the adverse reaction and AN69 showed a more than 100-fold increase in the venous effluent of the dialyzer (4,900 +/- 130 fmol/ml vs. baseline 40 +/- 3 after 5 minutes). Although none of the patients received ACE inhibitors, there were a further 4 asymptomatic individuals who showed more than twofold increases in plasma bradykinin concentrations in the venous effluent of the AN69 dialyzer. When these patients were treated with cuppropane or polysulfone dialyzers, no significant formation of bradykinin was detected and there were no adverse events. Taken together, these findings suggest that anaphylactoid reactions with the AN69 membrane are due to excessive formation of bradykinin, which can occur even in the absence of ACE inhibitors.",0,0

For the analysis of risk factors, multiple baseline variables were analyzed univariately to select those significant for inclusion in multivariate stepwise logistic regression. Alternatively, the CART-(classification and regression tree) technique was used. Both techniques showed that diastolic blood pressure < or = 70 mmHg was the most important risk factor.

After a four-week acclimation phase, a six-week intervention trial was conducted in which four matched groups of 14 patients receiving captopril or enalapril were assigned to one of four dietary treatments: low sodium (80 mmol/day) fat (5 g omega-3 fatty acids per day) with fish; normal sodium with fish oil (150 mmol/day); low sodium with olive oil; regular sodium with olive oil. All subjects adopted a low sodium diet, and adjustments in nutrient intake were made by double-blind administration of sodium and fats in supplement tablets and capsules. BP fell in all treatment groups at the time of intervention. However, the reduction in SBP was 4.2 mmHg greater in subjects with low sodium intake than those receiving normal sodium. There was no difference in blood pressure between those taking olive oil and those taking fish oil, but plasma triglycerides and serum thromboxane production were decreased by 27% and 51%, respectively, in the latter.

1694,8173699,Differential effects of ACE inhibitors and vasodilators on the kidney function curve in patients with primary hypertension.,,"Fliser, D; Nowack, R; Wolf, G; Ritz, E","In experimental studies, differential effects of antihypertensive agents on the kidney function curve were observed: in SHR, captopril lowered the slope of the kidney function curve, that is, blood pressure (BP) became salt-sensitive while hydralazine changed the curve without changing the curve. To evaluate whether ACE inhibitors and vasodilators have differential effects on salt sensitivity of BP in humans, we compared the effect of the ACE inhibitor cilazapril and the vasodilator dihydralazine on the kidney function curve in a randomized prospective single-blind crossover study; Nine patients (1 f, 8 m, mean age 41 +/- 4 years) with mild to moderate primary hypertension were given a low (20 mmol/day) and high salt diet (200 mmol/day). Drugs randomly low salt+cilazapril, high salt+cilazapril; low salt+dihydralazine, high salt+dihydralazine; or in reverse order; All antihypertensive interventions reduced BP, but mean post-treatment MAP was significantly lower with cilazapril at low salt intake (83.6 +/- 2.8 mmHg) compared to all of the following (p < 0.02): at high salt intake (86.4 +/-) dihydralazine at cilazapril 2.9 mmHg), low (91.6 +/- 3.2 mmHg) and high salt (90.1 +/- 3.3 mmHg) intake. Possibly as a result of sympathetic activation, mean daily heart rate was higher after dihydralazine at low (72.9 +/- 2.9 b/min) and high salt intake (72.4 +/- 2.8 b/min) after cilazapril at both salt intakes (68). .7 +/- 3.1 and 62.7 +/- 3.2 b/min); The results document that BP reduction after acute ACE inhibition is a function of salt intake, that is, BP is ""salt sensitive"" with ACE inhibitor therapy. In contrast, dihydralazine-type vasodilators have similar antihypertensive effects on low and high salt intake. To the extent that the findings of this short-term study can be predicted to long-term effects, they suggest that intrarenal mechanisms, namely the reset of the pressure-natriuresis relationship, play a role in the long-term antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors.",0,0
1695,8173700,Comparison of spirapril and isradipine in patients with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension.,,"NÃ¸rgaard, K; Jensen, T; Christensen, P; Feldt-Rasmussen, B","The effects of spirapril and isradipine on blood pressure, urinary albumin excretion and sodium volume homeostasis in hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients with nephropathy were evaluated. Fifteen patients with Type 1 diabetes, aged 28-53 and diabetes duration of 19-37 years, were included in the study. All had hypertension and diabetic nephropathy with urinary albumin excretion greater than 300 mg/24 hours. After a single 4-week period of placebo treatment, patients were randomly assigned to treatment with the calcium antagonist isradipine SRO 5 mg once daily or the ACE inhibitor spirapril 6 mg once daily for 6 months in a double-blind design. Isradipine reduced ambulatory systolic blood pressure from 152 +/- 12 to 141 +/- 11 mmHg (p < 0.05) and ambulatory diastolic pressure from 91 +/- 9 to 86 +/- 8 mmHg (p < 0.05) dropped it. The blood pressure lowering effect of spirapril was similar: 156 +/- 13 versus 143 +/- 11 mmHg (p < 0.01) and 90 +/- 4 versus 84 +/- 4 mmHg (p < 0.05). Fractional albumin clearance remained unchanged on isradipine, but decreased by a mean of 20% after 6 months of treatment with spirapril (p < 0.05). Total body decreased on exchangeable sodium spirapril treatment: 2994 +/- 296 versus 2636 +/-194 meq/1.73 m2 (p < 0.05) and extracellular volume tended to do so (p = 0.12). These parameters remained unchanged in isradipine treatment. In conclusion, both isradipine and spirapril reduced blood pressure in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Only the ACE inhibitor had demonstrably beneficial effects on urinary albumin excretion rate and sodium volume expansion seen in these patients.",0,0

Short-term and long-term effects.,,"Di Pasquale, P; Paterna, S; Cannizzaro, S; Bucca, V","Several experimental studies on animals and isolated cardiac preparations show that captopril can reduce injury after ischemic reperfusion. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of captopril before thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and included 259 patients hospitalized within 4 hours of symptom onset.

Captopril doses were then increased in both groups according to blood pressure. All patients were divided into subgroups according to the localization of the infarction. Anterior AMI was demonstrated by 166 patients (84 from Group A and 82 from Group B); 93 patients showed sub-AMI (47 from Group A and 46 from Group B). Ventricular hyperkinetic arrhythmias (VHAs) due to reperfusion were evaluated during the first 2 hours.

1698,8178391,Surgery and percutaneous angioplasty in the treatment of renovascular hypertension.,,"Libertino, J A; Beckmann, C F","Unfortunately, no randomized studies have compared PTRA with surgery or medical treatment for renovascular hypertension. PTRA appears to be a safe and relatively simple procedure with lower complication rates than the operation. The outcome of renal angioplasty depends on the type of stricture. In all published series, cure rates for fibromuscular disease are significantly higher than for atherosclerotic disease, and PTRA appears to be the procedure of choice for the treatment of hypertension in patients with fibromuscular disease. The role of renal angioplasty in patients with renovascular hypertension due to atherosclerotic diseases is unclear. Most of the large published series describing the success of angioplasty in patients with atherosclerotic lesions have been highly selective, including primarily patients with focal stenotic lesions. Despite this selectivity, the cure rate was only 19%. In completely unselected patients, atherosclerotic lesions are associated with a very high technical failure rate, possibly up to 60%. Based on available data, focal isolated stenotic lesions of the renal artery due to atherosclerotic disease can be treated with a reasonable success rate. The success rate appears to be very limited in patients with bilateral disease, osteal stenosis, or complete occlusion of the renal arteries. In these patients, angioplasty should only be attempted when there is a contraindication to surgery.",0,0

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) should be administered to all patients with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction unless contraindicated or tolerated. While ACE-Is are effective, there is reason to believe that further blocking of the RAAS by aldosterone antagonists and/or alternative ways of blocking the RAAS using renin inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blocking agents may have an important future role.

Due to its longer half-life and higher stability, the N-terminal (N-terminal proANF) of the ANF prohormone may be a better integrator of atrial peptide secretion than ANF itself. Elevation of ANF and other neurohormones after myocardial infarction has been associated with poor prognosis. However, the independent predictive value of these neurohormones was significantly reduced when left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and other important clinical variables were included in the multivariate analysis. To test the prognostic value of N-terminal proANF after myocardial infarction, plasma concentration was measured at a mean of 12 days post-infarction in 246 patients in the Survival and Ventricular Expansion (SAVE) Study. N-terminal proANF was a much stronger survival predictor than ANF itself.

During the in-hospital period, plasma N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide decreased in enalapril-treated patients, while increased in placebo-treated patients with complicated acute myocardial infarction (p < 0.05). Over the next 6 months, the differences were insignificant. Early administration of enalapril significantly reduced cardiac enlargement after myocardial infarction and possibly improved hemodynamics during the acute phase of complicated infarction. A decrease in ejection fraction during recovery indicates a deterioration in systolic function. The reduction in regional ejection fraction due to infarction suggests that the deterioration may be due to poor healing of the infarct scar.",0,0

In contrast, plasma ACTH was elevated and the change of ACTH over time was significantly different from the decrease in plasma CRH, AVP, or cortisol (P < 0.001 for each comparison). No significant differences were observed in plasma CRH, AVP, ACTH, or cortisol responses to placebo, captopril, or enalapril; Within 6 hours after myocardial infarction, mean plasma CRH, AVP, and cortisol values increased significantly above the mean control values, while ACTH decreased significantly. During the 3 days following acute myocardial infarction, plasma CRH, AVP and cortisol decreased significantly and this model was unaffected by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. In contrast, plasma ACTH showed a significant increase over time. This suggests that the usual relationships between CRH, AVP, and ACTH, and between ACTH and cortisol, are disrupted in patients presenting to the hospital with myocardial infarction. Maximum AVP levels observed in 12 patients exceeded 50 pmol/l, which may be high enough to impede tissue perfusion.

We describe an approach that involved a smaller, shorter study that led to a longer, larger study investigating the antihypertensive effects of increasing doses of imidapril, a new ACE inhibitor. Both studies were prospectively planned assuming a clinically beneficial reduction in blood pressure of 8 mm Hg (sd = 9). The studies included patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (baseline sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) 95–115 mm Hg). After a 2-3 week placebo run-in, patients received placebo or imidapril 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mg in the 2-week study (n = 91), or imidapril 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg in the 4-week study. (n = 162). 2. Overall mean baseline SDBP was 103.4 mm Hg (sd 0.62) in the first study and 101.5 mm Hg (sd 0.41) in the 4-week study. 3. Compared with placebo, imidapril 10, 20 and 40 mg significantly reduced SDBP. There was no significant difference between these doses, suggesting that 10 mg achieved maximum ACE inhibition in most patients. The 2.5 mg dose showed no significant effect. The 5 mg dose gave an intermediate effect. The overall incidence of adverse events in both studies was similar in the imidapril and placebo groups and was not of concern.",0,0

During each phase, doses were titrated to achieve a clinical supine systolic blood pressure pre-dose of 140 mmHg or to reach a predetermined maximum dose. In both the felodipine and combination phases, supine prelying and standing systolic and diastolic pressures were significantly reduced compared to the placebo phase (reduction in supine pressure: -13/-5 and -18/-7, respectively). In the enalapril phase, only the pre-supine diastolic pressure dose was significantly reduced (-3 mmHg) compared to placebo. In combination, the effects of the two drugs on pre-dose blood pressure were additive. There was a 40-60% increase in reported symptoms in the felodipine and combination phases compared to the placebo and enalapril phases. Thus, in elderly patients with systolic hypertension, felodipine effectively lowers blood pressure throughout the dose range, but has vasodilator side effects. In contrast, enalapril is well tolerated but less effective in lowering blood pressure over the entire dose range.",0,0

Groups randomized to lisinopril or nifedipine were not significantly different for any demographic variables. An analysis of data collected from all centers showed significantly greater reductions in both lying and standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) on lisinopril than on nifedipine treatment (difference between treatments 7.70 +/-3.34 mmHg; P = 0.02 and 10.2 +/- 3, 30 mmHg; P = 0.003 for supine and standing SBP, respectively). However, this difference may be explained by the slightly higher mean SBP in the lisinopril treatment groups compared to the nifedipine group at the end of the placebo acclimation period. Both treatments reduced inpatient and outpatient diastolic blood pressures (DBP) to the same extent, and the response rates to the two treatments were the same. The effects of the two drugs on heart rate were indistinguishable from each other. There were six lisinopril and 12 nifedipine-treated patients taken during randomized treatment (P = 0.22). Nineteen percent of lisinopril patients reported an adverse event compared to 36% of nifedipine patients. The relative risk of an adverse event on lisinopril compared to nifedipine was 0.42 (confidence limits 1.027-0.172), a difference approaching statistical significance (P = 0.0573).

Sublingual captopril (25 mg), nifedipine (10 mg), and prazosin (2 mg) were prescribed to determine the efficacy and safety of each drug in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies during hemodialysis. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured continuously up to 120 minutes post-dose. Response rates were 83% for captopril, 90% for nifedipine, and 11% for prazosin. Significant hypotensive effects of both sublingual captopril and nifedipine occurred at 10 minutes and persisted for up to 120 minutes.

Results of previous studies contradict the relationship of various features of postlytic lesions to predict reocclusion; Therefore, a computer-assisted algorithm was used to quantitatively measure edge roughness in the 90-minute postlysis angiogram of 84 patients who received recombinant tissue plasminogen activator within 6 hours of chest pain; Twenty-five patients had reocclusion and 59 did not. Baseline angiogram showed no difference between these two groups in terms of minimal dimensions or relative percentage of stenosis. The length was longer in the reclosing group (12.2 +/- 5.0 vs 10.0 +/- 4.2 mm, P < 0.05). Three of the four roughness indices based on the curvature analysis showed greater roughness in patients with reocclusion. These differences are largely due to the increased length of these lesions. However, scaled edge-to-length ratio, a length-independent roughness index, was significantly higher in the reclosing group (1.15 +/- 0.10 vs 1.09 +/-0.08, P < 0.006). Multiple regression analysis showed that lesion length, scaled edge length ratio, and number of features per cm (invaginations and deviations) independently correlated with the risk of reocclusion; The length and roughness of postlytic residual lesions are predictors of reocclusion.",0,0

1742,8280816,Review article: drug-induced hepatotoxicity.,,"Lee, W M","The liver is at the center of the metabolic regulation of almost all drugs and xenobiotics (foreign substances). For the most part, this process is carried out without damaging the liver itself or other organs. A few compounds, such as acetaminophen, CCl4, and the toxin responsible for mushroom poisoning, are themselves toxic or produce metabolites that cause liver damage in a uniform, dose-dependent manner. However, most agents form a sufficiently toxic by-product and very rarely cause liver damage under special circumstances. Production of a toxic metabolite within the hepatocyte can cause direct cell damage with disruption of intracellular function or indirect damage through immune-mediated membrane damage. Factors promoting toxin accumulation include genetic enzyme variants that allow further formation of the harmful metabolite, induction of an isozyme type that produces more than the normal amount of toxin, substrate competition for the enzyme, and interference with regulated (non-toxic) metabolic pathways. or depletion of essential detoxifying substrates. The following review will present clinical examples of some of these well-known metabolic reactions, discuss some recent issues in drug-induced hepatotoxicity, such as the use of combination agents and complex multidrug regimens, alternative health strategies (vitamins and herbal medicines). such as the widespread use of cocaine. The general message is that new opportunities for drug-induced hepatotoxicity arise as new compounds are released. Until extensive experience with any new compound has developed, it is best to maintain a healthy paranoia about new drugs - there are very few completely safe agents.",0,0

In an echocardiographic substudy of the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) Trial, we evaluated whether captopril could reduce progressive left ventricular enlargement in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction, and if so, whether this would be associated with improved clinical outcome. ; Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiograms were obtained in 512 patients at a mean of 11.1 +/- 3.2 days after infarction and repeated at 1 year in 420 surviving patients. Left ventricular size, end-diastolic and end-systole LV cavity areas, and LV function were evaluated as the percent change in cavity area from end-diastolic to end-systole. Patients were randomly assigned placebo or captopril, and the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events, such as cardiovascular death, hospitalization, or heart failure requiring open-label angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, and recurrent infarction, was determined over a mean follow-up period of 3.0. +/- 0.6 years. Regardless of treatment assignment, left ventricular systolic area at baseline and percent change in area were strong predictors of cardiovascular mortality and adverse cardiovascular events. At 1 year, the left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic areas were greater in the placebo than in the captopril group (P = .038, P = .015, respectively), and the percent change in cavity area was greater in the captopril group (P = .005). By 1-year echo measurements, one hundred 11 (26.4%) of 420 1-year survivors experienced a major cardiovascular event, and these patients had a more than three-fold increase in left ventricular cavity areas compared to those with an uncomplicated course. Compared with 42 patients in the captopril-treated group, 69 patients with adverse cardiovascular events were in the placebo group (a 35% risk reduction, P = .010); Two-dimensional echocardiography provides important and independent prognostic information in post-infarction patients. Post-infarction left ventricular enlargement and function are associated with the development of adverse cardiac events. Attenuation of ventricular enlargement with captopril was associated with a reduction in adverse events in these patients.

We examined the renal and endocrine responses to the renin inhibitor enalkiren, captopril, and placebo in nine healthy and nine hypertensive men on a 10 mmol sodium diet. Ang II was infused to evaluate the effects of agents on the renal and adrenal response to Ang II. Plasma Ang II concentration was suppressed similarly with enalkiren and captopril - the same level of blockade was achieved. Although the renal plasma flow was stable during placebo, a significant increase was seen with both enalkiren (+133 +/- 26 mL/min) and captopril (+99.4 +/- 22.6). There was considerable within-subject agreement between renal plasma flow responses to renin inhibition and converting enzyme inhibition (r = .90, P < .004). The vasodilator response to both agents was inversely proportional to the decrease in renal plasma flow induced by Ang II alone (r = -.66, P < .05).

1758,8300456,The effect of vasodilator therapy on mortality in chronic congestive heart failure.,,"Ghose, J C; Chakraborty, S; Mondal, M; Bhandari, B","We compared the effects of Hydralazine and Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) with captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on mortality in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (NYHA class III and IV). Patients on conventional therapy with digoxin and diuretics were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 51), hydralazine-ISDN. (n = 50) or captopril (n = 52) in a double-blind trial. At the end of 6 months, there were 14 deaths (27.4%) in the placebo group compared to 11 deaths in the hydralazine-ISDN group (22%) - a 20% death reduction (P > 0.05) and 10 deaths. captopril group (19.2%) - a 30% reduction in mortality (p > 0.05). Mortality at one year was 50%, 42%, and 30% in the placebo, hydralazine-ISDN, and captopril groups, respectively, and there was a 16% (p > 0.05) and 40% mortality reduction in the hydralazine-ISDN group. captopril group compared to placebo group (p < 0.05). The reduction in mortality was mainly due to the reduction in deaths attributed to progressive heart failure. Data show that adding captopril to conventional therapy significantly reduces mortality in patients with severe congestive heart failure. Hydralazine-isorobid dinitrate also reduced mortality, but this was not statistically significant.",0,0
1759,8300885,Angiotensin II receptor blockade: an innovative approach to cardiovascular pharmacotherapy.,,"Eberhardt, R T; Kevak, R M; Kang, P M; Frishman, W H","Thanks to the multiple effects of angiotensin II (AII), the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in cardiovascular homeostasis. Angiotensin II acts by binding to specific membrane-bound receptors that bind to one of several signal transduction pathways. These AII receptors exhibit heterogeneity represented by the AT1 and AT2 receptor subtypes. The AT1 receptor mediates the main cardiovascular action of RAS. This receptor has been cloned from several species showing properties consistent with a transmembrane, G-protein coupled receptor. More AII receptor heterogeneity is evident by cloning isotypes of the AT1 receptor. Blocking AII from interacting with its receptor is the most direct area for inhibiting the actions of RAS. Many AII receptor antagonists, including peptide analogs of AII and antibodies to AII, have adverse properties that limit their clinical use. However, the discovery and further development of imidazole compounds with AII antagonist properties and positive properties hold promise for clinical use. The leader in this area is losartan (formerly known as DuP 753 or MK-954), a selective AT1 receptor antagonist. Losartan has been shown to be an effective antagonist of many AII-induced actions and an effective antihypertensive agent in many animal models of hypertension (HTN). Losartan has also shown secondary benefits in preventing stroke, treating congestive heart failure (CHF) and delaying the progression of kidney disease in animal models. Clinical studies confirm the AII antagonist effect of losartan and suggest that losartan will be effective in the treatment of essential HTN. All antagonism is likely to provide useful therapy in essential HTN and CHF, where RAS is known to play an important role. The benefit of AII antagonism may extend beyond that of HTN and CHF, as suggested by the potential benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in the treatment or prevention of many other diseases. The main advantage of AII antagonists over ACE inhibitors is that they can avoid the undesirable side effects associated with bradykinin potentiation with second drugs. AII antagonists will help determine the role of the RAS in physiological regulation and the pathophysiology of various disease states.",0,0

White women aged 60 to 80 years with placebo-treated sitting diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) of 95 to 114 mm Hg were assessed by history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and quality of life interview. After double-blind randomization with low-dose atenolol, enalapril, or isradipine, the dose was increased gradually and hydrochlorothiazide was added as needed to achieve target DBP (less than 90 mm Hg and greater than 10 mm Hg of baseline). During maintenance, non-target patients were 'paced' and patients with uncontrolled DBP at the maximum dose were excluded from the study. The mean pretreatment (baseline) blood pressure of the 315 randomized participants was 161/100 mm Hg; 92% had previously been treated for hypertension, 15% had diabetes, 11% were smokers and 38% consumed alcohol; For the 245 patients who completed the trial, the mean reduction in blood pressure during treatment was 18.2/15.6 mm Hg.

1763,8305640,Effect of low dose aspirin on thromboxane production and antihypertensive effect of captopril.,,"Smith, S R; Coffman, T M; Svetkey, L P","Some antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors occur via non-angiotensin II-mediated mechanisms. One is the reduction of quinine degradation, which leads to increased production of vasodilator arachidonic acid metabolites. It was thought that maneuvers that selectively inhibit thromboxane production without reducing prostaglandins (PG) E2 + PGI2 may enhance the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibition if ACE inhibition also leads to an increase in the production of the potent vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2. Therefore, this double-blind, randomized, crossover study was conducted to determine: (1) whether captopril increases platelet and/or renal thromboxane production; and (2) low-dose aspirin enhances the antihypertensive effect of captopril. Patients with mild essential hypertension and no other major medical problems were studied. In a double-blind, random order, patients received captopril alone for 2 weeks (25 mg every 12 hours) and another 2 weeks of captopril plus aspirin (75 mg/day). Single-blind placebo was administered for 2 weeks prior to active treatment periods. Fifteen patients with a mean age of 53 years and a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 114 +/- 8 (+/- SD) mm Hg were studied. Serum thromboxane B2 was higher during treatment with captopril/placebo (600 +/- 46 (+/- SE) pg/mL) compared to the two combined washout periods (420 +/- 57 and 553 +/-) (P < 0.05 ). 78) and was lowest during treatment with captopril/aspirin (302 +/- 36) (P < 0.0005). Captopril treatment significantly increased the urinary excretion of PGE2 (P = 0.038). Captopril/placebo significantly reduced MAP (P < 0.05) to 105.0 +/- 3.7 mm Hg compared to the washout period. However, the addition of aspirin to captopril did not cause an additional decrease in MAP (105.2 +/- 2.8 mm Hg). It was concluded that treatment with captopril increases platelet thromboxane production. However, lowering platelet thromboxane with low-dose aspirin may not enhance the antihypertensive effect of captopril.",0,0

Substitution of nifedipine GITS for conventional formulations of nifedipine, diltiazem or verapamil provided adequate control of anginal symptoms in patients with stable angina pectoris. Nifedipine GITS appears to preserve quality of life and is apparently better tolerated than nifedipine formulations requiring 2 or 3 times daily administration in both older and younger patients. In addition, it has minimal effect on lipid and glucose metabolism and reverses left ventricular hypertrophy and is therefore suitable for the treatment of most patients with mild to moderate hypertension or angina pectoris.",0,0

1773,8522630,Management of hypertensive emergencies and emergencies.,,"Abdelwahab, W; Frishman, W; Landau, A","Hypertensive emergency is a condition of elevation of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure with acute target organ disease. Hypertensive urgency is a condition in which blood pressure is elevated (diastolic > 120 mmHg) without acute target organ disease. Hypertensive emergencies are best managed with parenteral medications and careful intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring. Hydralazine is widely used in the treatment of hypertension in eclampsia and preeclampsia, and its safety has been proven in these patients. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) has the most reliable antihypertensive activity, which begins soon after administration and ends when the infusion is stopped. As with diazoxide, it should be used with caution in patients with impaired cerebral flow. SNP is the drug of choice to achieve controlled hypotension in patients undergoing neurovascular surgery. Intravenous nitroglycerin is useful in patients prone to myocardial ischemia, but should not be used in patients with increased intracranial pressure. Esmolol is effective in controlling both supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and severe hypertension. Its short duration of action makes it useful in an emergency, but its use should be avoided in patients with low cardiac output due to its negative inotropic effect. Verapamil should not be used in patients with pre-existing conduction abnormalities. Nicardipine is a potent arteriolar vasodilator with no significant direct depressant effect on the myocardium. As with other afterload reducing agents, it should not be used in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Because angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors often cause cerebral vasodilation, enalaprilat may be particularly beneficial in patients at high risk of developing cerebral hypotensive episodes due to impaired cerebral circulation. Fenoldopam, a selective post-synaptic dopaminergic receptor (DA1), has been shown to be effective in the treatment of severe hypertension with a lower incidence of side effects than the SNP. Hypertensive emergencies can usually be managed with oral agents. Oral nifedipine, captopril, clonidine, labetalol, prazosin, and nimodipine have been shown to be effective in these conditions.",0,0

The decline in glomerular filtration rate over the years was significantly steeper in the DD group than in the ID and II groups (p = 0.02; mean -3.79, -1.37, and -1.12 mL/min per year). DD patients treated with enalapril had as poor a course as DD patients treated with atenolol. No drug decreased the degree of proteinuria in the DD group; Our data show that patients with the DD genotype are resistant to the widely advocated renoprotective therapy.",0,0

North-East Italy Microalbuminuria Working Group.,,"Trevisan, R; Tiengo, A","Microalbuminuria predicts early mortality and kidney disease in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients. In insulin-dependent diabetic patients, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition reduces microalbuminuria and delays the progression of kidney disease. The aim of this study was persistent microalbuminuria (AER > 20 < 200 microgram/min) and normal blood pressure or mild hypertension. The study was a 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 14 hospital-based diabetes centers in northeastern Italy. Blood pressure, plasma glucose, and body weight were determined monthly; AER, serum creatinine, glycosylated hemoglobin and plasma lipids at baseline, 1 month later, and at study end. Of the 122 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients randomly assigned to receive either ramipril (1.25 mg/day) or placebo, 108 (54 in the ramipril group and 54 in the placebo group) completed the study. At baseline, age, duration of diabetes, body mass index, and glycosylated hemoglobin were similar in the two groups and remained unchanged throughout the study. In the placebo group, the AER increased from a baseline median of 65 micrograms/min (range 53 to 76, 95% confidence interval) to 72 micrograms/min (57 to 87) and 83 micrograms/min after 1 (62 to 76 micrograms/min). 104) rose. and 6 months, but decreased from 62 micrograms/min (48-76) to 45 micrograms/min (33-57) and 53 micrograms/min (38-69) in the ramipril group, with no significant difference between groups (P < .01).(ABSTRACT HAS BEEN CUT WITH 250 WORDS)",0,0

Combination therapy with 20/25 mg benazepril/hydrochlorothiazide was compared with 20 mg benazepril alone and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone. Sitting systolic blood pressure and the effect of race and age on treatment efficacy were also evaluated. Compared with placebo, all benazepril/hydrochlorothiazide combinations produced statistically significant reductions from baseline in sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressures at study endpoint. In the benazepril/hydrochlorothiazide, 20/25 mg group, the adjusted mean changes in sitting diastolic blood pressure at the endpoint were statistically significantly greater than in the monotherapy treatment groups (benazepril, 20 mg, P < or = .05; hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg, P < or = .001) alone. All treatments were generally well tolerated.

In a psychophysiological study, we evaluated the effect of verapamil (V) and enalapril (E) both as monotherapy and in combination. Office blood pressure was successfully lowered (< 145/90 mmHg) in 11 patients treated with V (V-Resp) and 10 patients treated with E (E-Resp). Both drugs were prescribed to 9 patients (V+E) who did not lower their blood pressure (N-Resp) sufficiently with monotherapy. Patients administered three stressors (colored word stroop, cold press, and handgrip). Extracardiovascular and hemodynamic functions were measured at baseline, stress and recovery periods. Response was assessed by adding changes that occurred at each stage of the psychophysiological session. This was done before exercise and after any modification of the therapeutic intervention. Emotional arousal (phrontalis muscle contraction, skin conductivity, peripheral temperature) decreased when BP was normal. No change in BP reactivity was found. HR response was decreased in V-Resp and cardiac output was increased in E-Resp, while vascular reaction was restricted in E-Resp and V-Resp. This was also reduced in N-Resp when they accepted V+E and normalized their arterial pressures. The findings suggest that sympathetic reactivity can be altered by therapy. In particular, verapamil restricted the cardiac stress response without reducing cardiac output and was advantageously associated with enalapril to control the psychophysiological response in more refractory hypertensive patients.",0,0

Group C consisted of 10 healthy volunteers as the control group. Changes in baseline MA during and after exercise were examined in all three groups. Ergometric test up to 600 kg was applied to normotensive patients without metabolic disorder, normal kidney function and proteinuria. This test was repeated after administration of 20 mg of enalapril once daily for 60 days. Body weight, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, creatinine and creatinine clearance were determined and did not show significant differences neither between groups nor with treatment. Microalbuminuria was studied in three groups with and without enalapril for 2 months of the study. Determinations were made under rest, exercise, and post-exercise conditions. The mean baseline MA values +/- SEM were as follows: 5.22 +/- 0.49, 58.36 +/- 13.24 and 4.73 +/- 0.45 at rest for groups A, B, and C, respectively. microgram/min; with exercise, 15.19 +/- 4.43, 74.70 +/- 14.89 and 16.76 +/- 4.62 micrograms/min for groups A, B and C, respectively; and post-exercise, 32.04 +/- 6.64, 253.15 +/- 63.88 and 9.23 +/- 3.25 micrograms/min, respectively.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the course of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during antihypertensive therapy in hypertensive NIDDM patients. We also compared the effects of ACE inhibitors (cilazapril, Inibace, Roche, Milan, Italy) and Ca(2+)-channel blockers (amlodipine, Norvasc, Pfizer, Roma, Italy). Forty-four of the hypertensive NIDDM patients who applied to the internal medicine departments of the University of Padova and Sassari participated in this study. Of these patients, 26 were normoalbuminuric and 18 were microalbuminuric. They were randomly treated with cilazapril or amlodipine. The target of antihypertensive therapy was <140 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 85 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (BP). Microalbuminuria was defined as an albumin excretion rate (AER) between 20 and 200 micrograms/min. GFR was measured by plasma clearance of 51Cr-labeled EDTA at baseline and every 6-12 months over a 3-year follow-up interval. A significant decrease was observed in GFR, AER, systolic and diastolic BP values during antihypertensive treatment in normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients. The decrease in GFR in the general population of NIDDM patients was significant and inversely proportional to the reduction in mean BP (diastolic + 1/3 pulse pressure) (r = -0.80, P < 0.0001), but not HbA1c, triglycerides, and BMI. The annual GFR decline (mean +/- SE) in the normoalbuminuric patient was 2.03 +/- 0.66 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2 (95% CI 0.92-3.17) and 2.01 +/- 0.71 ml during cilazapril. min-1 x 1.73 m-2 (95% CI 0.82-3.11) during amlodipine therapy.

Cilazapril and amlodipine reduced AER to a similar extent in normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients. No significant changes in other clinical and biochemical features were observed between the two antihypertensive treatments and especially HbA1c, BMI, triglycerides and cholesterol plasma values. These results support the belief that arterial hypertension plays a crucial role in contributing to kidney injury in NIDDM, even when the AER is normal. However, the degree of BP control with both cilazapril and amlodipine can successfully delay the slope of GFR decline in hypertensive NIDDM patients with or without new-onset nephropathy.",0,0

After placebo and after captopril, there was no significant change (absolute or proportional) in BP values among patients with essential hypertension or RAS, for all measures or when reduction in BP only was taken into account. Receiver operator characteristic curves of both baseline and post-captopril peripheral renin levels indicate that the captopril test does not appropriately discriminate between patients with essential hypertension and RAS.

However, regardless of the treatment assigned, fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels increased and it was generally not possible to maintain near-normal glycemia. Even insulin therapy failed to achieve its therapeutic target of near-normal glycemia due to the difficulty in treating the overt hyperglycemia and the risk of hypoglycemic episodes.

Patients were given 4 mg perindopril or 2.5/25 mg amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide once daily. Patients were then screened for a 3-month single-blind placebo extinction period; After 6 months of treatment, systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced with perindopril (supine 11%, sitting 10%) and amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (supine 8%, sitting 12%). Diastolic blood pressure was also significantly reduced with perindopril (supine 8%, sitting 11%) and amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (supine 4%, sitting 9%). Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly during treatment with perindopril (9%) and amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (6%). Cardiac index increased with perindopril (6%) due to increased stroke index (5%), but amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide did not change cardiac function. The systemic vascular resistance index was significantly reduced with perindopril (14%) compared with amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (8%). Extensibility of the common carotid artery was significantly increased (16%) with perindopril, but not with amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (1% difference). The difference between perindopril and amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide for carotid elasticity was statistically significant. Common carotid artery compliance tended to increase more with perindopril (7%) than with amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide, which caused a 5% reduction in carotid compliance. After discontinuation of treatment, all treatment-related changes for both drugs were returned to pre-treatment values within 7 weeks; Elasticity of the elastic common carotid artery was increased by perindopril but not by amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide. Large artery properties of muscular arteries and systemic vascular resistance improved with both drugs, but overall the changes were more pronounced with perindopril than with amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide. The present results suggest that perindopril has a more pronounced effect on both macro and microcirculatory levels, which will ultimately lead to a greater reduction in cardiac afterload.

Indomethacin attenuated the antihypertensive effect of enalapril (45%) during the 24-hour evaluation period, but did not interfere with the effect of nifedipine. Furthermore, indomethacin similarly significantly reduced the fractional excretion of sodium and plasma levels of prostaglandins when added to the enalapril or nifedipine regimen; Vasodilator prostaglandins are likely involved in the antihypertensive effects of enalapril but not nifedipine, and this interaction appears to be independent of any indomethacin-induced reduction in renal sodium excretion.

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Although they are generally well tolerated, a dry cough may develop, sometimes requiring discontinuation of treatment. The prevalence of cough reported with ACE inhibitor therapy ranged from 0.2% to 25%, depending on data collection, analysis, and symptom reporting methods. 2. To assess the prevalence of cough in Chinese patients taking ACE inhibitors, interviews were conducted with 191 patients in Hong Kong receiving captopril or enalapril-containing therapy for hypertension or heart failure, and 382 gender- and age-matched patients. drugs that exclude an ACE inhibitor (controls). Patients and controls were interviewed blindly by the same interviewer using a joint adverse effects questionnaire. 3.

Hypertension may not be the dominant risk factor for coronary heart disease as it is for cerebrovascular disease, and metabolic factors are gaining more importance. The reason for the differential effect of antihypertensive therapy may be partially explained by the adverse metabolic effects of some antihypertensive drugs, which may reduce the beneficial effects. When making decisions regarding antihypertensive therapy, it is imperative to assess the patient's overall cardiovascular risk and take into account the possible effects of different antihypertensive drugs on these factors.",0,0

A 7-year follow-up study.,,"Ravid, M; Lang, R; Rachmani, R; Lishner, M","Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in developed countries. Duration of diabetes, blood pressure values and metabolic status are the main determinants of the course of nephropathy, and microalbuminuria is the hallmark of its onset. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors offer significant renoprotection in hypertensive and normotensive patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Our study extends previous observations regarding the effect of duration and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on advanced nephropathy. 7-year double-blind (first phase) and open (second phase) randomized controlled trial. Ninety-four normotensive patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with serum creatinine levels less than 123.76 mumol/L (1.4 mg/dL) and microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg/24 hours) were given enalapril maleate 10 mg. /d or placebo for 5 years. They were followed openly for another 2 years and were given the choice of taking enalapril or no treatment; Albuminuria remained stable for 7 years in patients treated with enalapril. An increase from 123 +/- 58 to 310 +/- 167 mg/24 hours occurred after 5 years (mean +/- SD) in the untreated group and a further increase to (mean +/- SD) 393 +/- it happened. After 7 years, 223 mg/24 hours occurred. Mutual creatinine did not change in patients treated for 7 years; the mean reduction in untreated patients was 13% at 5 years and 16% at 7 years. Treatment with enalapril resulted in a 42% absolute risk reduction for developing nephropathy over 7 years (95% confidence interval, 15% to 69%; P < .001, Student's t test). Glycosylated hemoglobin and body mass index remained unchanged.; Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition provides long-term protection against the development of nephropathy in normotensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with microalbuminuria and stabilizes renal function in previously untreated patients with impaired renal function.

After stopping the antihypertensive drugs used for at least 2 weeks, the patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. 25 subjects were treated with perindopril 4 to 8 mg (Group A) once daily in the morning and 22 subjects were treated with 25 to 62.5 mg of metoprolol (Group B) twice daily. Subjects were evaluated before and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment using echocardiography. The LV mass indexes (LVMI) of the two groups before treatment were 143.2 +/- 21.3 g/m2 and 140.6 +/- 23.7 g/m2, respectively (P > 0.05). In group A, LVMI reduction occurred after 4 weeks of treatment and was more pronounced (143.2 +/- 21.3 g/m2 to 126.6 +/-15.3 g/m2, P < 0.001) after 8 weeks, whereas LVMI decrease occurred. only in Group B after 8 weeks (from 140.6 +/- 23.7 g/m2 to 133.4 +/- 13.2 g/m2, P < 0.001).

Enalapril 5 mg or placebo was given orally at 10:00 (daily trial) or 22:00 (nighttime trial) to 12 patients with essential hypertension. Serum concentrations of total drug (enalapril + enalaprilat, its active metabolite) during the day and night trials never differed significantly. However, serum enalaprilat tended to be higher and its maximum concentration higher in the daytime trial than in the nighttime trial. Blood pressure dropped at 22:00, but not at 10:00, 24 hours after enalapril administration. Plasma BK tended to increase at 10:00, but not at 22:00, following administration of enalapril. Significant increases in plasma BK were observed in two patients in the daily trial, one of whom also complained of cough. However, no such increase or subsequent adverse effect in plasma BK was noted in the night trial. Plasma substance P and PGE2 were not significantly altered following administration of enalapril in the day or night trial.

Secondary outcome measures included changes in established DBP, pulse rate, laboratory parameters, and adverse side effects. Following 1 year of treatment in 135 patients, blood pressure dropped from baseline by 16/14 mm Hg in patients receiving moexipril monotherapy and by 27/17 mmHg in those receiving combined therapy (P < 0.001 for both). After 2 years of treatment, reductions were similar in 120 patients. Nineteen patients (11%) dropped out early due to inadequate therapeutic response and 28 patients (16%) due to adverse experiences. There were no significant changes in postural reductions in pulse rate or BP with moexipril monotherapy or combination therapy. Three adverse events occurred with a frequency exceeding 2%, possibly or possibly attributable to moexipril or combination therapy: hypotension (2%), dizziness (6%), and increased cough (12%).

Age-matched, untreated SHR (n = 16) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (n = 17) served as controls. Experiments were carried out at 40 weeks; Discontinuation of captopril therapy resulted in rapid reversion of SBP to near untreated SHR in the low-dose group, while a consistently lower SBP was maintained in the high-dose group. Both doses of captopril therapy completely prevented wall hypertrophy of arteriolar resistance vessels or muscle vessels. Captopril decreased the left ventricular mass:body weight ratio in a dose-dependent manner. High doses of captopril improved resting and stress systolic and diastolic function. Thoracic angiotensin converting enzyme levels were dose-dependently decreased with captopril treatment. The curves of the perfusion pressure response to increasing doses of phenylephrine were shifted to the right in both captopril treatment groups compared with that of the control SHR. Addition of L-NAME and L-arginine to the perfusate increased or decreased vasoconstrictor activity in all rats, whereas high-dose captopril completely restored abnormal hypersensitivity to L-NAME and resulted in less attenuation in response to L-arginine. control SHR.; The persistent low blood pressure caused by early captopril therapy was mainly attributed to the sustained normalization of the structure and function of the resistance vessels, which may be mediated in part by the improvement of endothelial cell function. Persistent reduction of angiotensin converting enzyme activity in the blood vessel wall attenuated left ventricular hypertrophy, and the improvement of cardiac systolic and diastolic function may contribute to the sustained hypotensive effect.",0,0

Patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension were accepted to participate in the study. Mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) > or = 95 and < or = 115 mm Hg were required to enter the treatment phase of the study. Patients were randomized to receive losartan 50 mg once daily or enalapril 5 mg once daily. The dose of enalapril may be titrated to 10 mg after 4 weeks and 25 mg of HCTZ may be added after 8 weeks based on SiDBP measurements at clinical visits. Losartan dose remained at 50 mg; After 8 weeks, 12.5 mg of HCTZ can be added. If SiDBP remained > or = mm Hg, changes in treatment regimen were required at each step. Diuretic doses were selected based on commercially available forms of the test agents in combination with HCTZ. During the treatment phase of the study, the lowest blood pressure, heart rate, and safety parameters were measured at 4-week intervals. Significant reductions in mean SiDBP and mean sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) were achieved with both treatments at all time points (weeks 4, 8 and 12). Overall, no significant differences between treatment groups were observed for mean changes in SiDBP or SiSBP. At study end, patients receiving the losartan regimen had a mean decrease in SiDBP of 10.3 mm Hg, while patients on the enalapril regimen had a mean decrease of 9.8 mm Hg. Similarly, the percentage of patients who achieved the blood pressure reduction goal was not significantly different between the groups.

Large trials have demonstrated a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with long-term use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, or acute myocardial infarction. The reductions in acute ischemic events (eg, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and need for early revascularization) were independent of the ejection fraction and were greater than would be expected from the small reduction in blood pressure that occurred; that benefit from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy of other patients with coronary artery disease. This hypothesis is being tested in multiple double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials with follow-up periods of 3 to 5 years, which will include approximately 30,000 patients. Trials vary with patient population (eg, normotensive versus hypertensive, normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic, with and without diabetes mellitus), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor used, and outcome measures.

The goal of treatment is to limit the progression of end-organ damage in patients with hypertensive crises. Several potent antihypertensive drugs such as sodium nitroprusside, labetalol, and urapidil are available to provide an immediate drop in blood pressure. The choice of the drug should be made on the basis of its pharmacodynamic properties, clinical effects, advantages and contraindications. In addition, rapid lowering of blood pressure carries a significant risk if performed in an uncontrolled manner and leads to further end-organ damage.

We tested whether acute ACEI influences the effects of isometric exercise in patients with CHF. In the first part of the study, we showed that isometric exercise increased blood pressure in the control group and CHF group, whereas cardiac output increased only in the control group. While stroke volume remained unchanged in the control group, it was significantly reduced in the CHF group. We next analyzed the effect of acute ACEI (5 mg ramipril) on the reduction in cardiac output during isometric stress in patients with CHF. Mean blood pressure and heart rate increased similarly in both groups during isometric exercise. However, cardiac output decreased -0.48 +/-0.12 L/min (p < 0.01) during placebo but not during ACEI. Spectral analysis of blood pressure showed an increase (p < 0.01) in the high-frequency parasympathetic component from 7.3% +/- 3.6% to 18.1% +/- 9.5% after ACEI. Plasma levels of norepinephrine increased after isometric stress in the placebo group, while other hormones were unchanged. ACEI inhibited the increase of norepinephrine after isometric stress. Thus, the decrease in cardiac output during isometric exercise in patients with CHF was prevented by acute ACEI. The effect of ACE inhibition may be related to decreased sympathetic activity.",0,0

Considering the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to the hypertensive remodeling of the heart and coronary circulation, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may function as cardioreparative drugs in arterial hypertension. Accordingly, our aim in this study was to examine under clinical conditions the extent to which long-term antihypertensive treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor improves reduced coronary flow reserve in hypertensive patients with microvascular angina pectoris. For comparison, we also treated a normotensive control group of 6 patients with hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. Fifteen hypertensive individuals (10 males, 5 females; age 58 +/- 6 years) were treated with enalapril (10 to 20 mg/day; mean, 16.7 +/- 4.9 mg/day) for 11 to 13 months.

1833,8629540,Angiotensin-II receptor antagonists: a new class of antihypertensive agents.,,"Weir, M R","It is known that pharmacological agents that reduce the effect of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system reduce systemic arterial blood pressure through a vasodilator effect and increase the renal clearance of sodium and water. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are known to antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system through their ability to inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. A new class of antihypertensive agents, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, has been developed recently. These agents specifically block the angiotensin II receptor, limiting angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction and reducing aldosterone secretion. These effects result in a reduction in systemic arterial blood pressure through reduced vascular tone and increased sodium and water clearance. Clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of these agents in lowering blood pressure. These newer antihypertensive agents also have uricosuric effects and are well tolerated with a low incidence of cough and angioedema, side effects seen with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Clinical trials are ongoing to see if these drugs could be useful in the treatment of diseases other than hypertension, such as congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease.",0,0

Exercise was performed during control conditions and after 3 weeks of treatment with digoxin (0.25 mg/day orally) or placebo. Ten normal volunteers matched for sex and age constituted the control group.

At the end of each period, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured as 51Cr-EDTA and 123I-hippuran clearance, respectively, and tubular function as assessed by lithium clearance technique was determined. Both drugs maintained GFR and ERPF and reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP, mm Hg) to a similar extent (time x treatment, P = 0.466): amlodipine from 126.9 +/- 2.5 to 115.9 +/- 2.2; perindopril 126.9 +/- 2.5 to 117.9 +/- 3.9 (time effect of all treatments combined, P = 0.003).

1838,8631567,The effect of atrial septal defect created during balloon mitral valvuloplasty on cardiac output and mitral valve area calculation.,,"Kapoor, A; Krishnamoorthy, K M; Radhakrishnan, S; Shrivastava, S","We examined the effect of atrial septal defect (ASD) formed during transseptal puncture on estimation of cardiac output (CO) and mitral valve area (MVA) after successful balloon mitral valvuloplasty (BMV) using the Inoue balloon in 20 patients. Oximetry work, pressure gradients, thermodilution CO and MVA were measured initially while partially inflating the Inoue balloon catheter while temporarily occluded the ASD. Measurements were repeated after the balloon catheter was withdrawn into the right atrium. Cardiac output and MVA after BMV were similar in both conditions (4.52 +/- 1.37 L/min vs. 4.50 +/- 1.19 L/min, respectively 1.89 +/- 0.4 cm2 versus 1.93 +/-0.38 cm2, p = ns ). Only 2 patients showed an atrial level increase in oximetry (9% and 16%, respectively), but neither had ASD occluded or otherwise significantly different CO or MVA. We concluded that the size of the ASD created by the Inoue balloon technique during BMV is small and does not significantly affect the estimation of CO or MVA if septal puncture is performed in the fossa ovalis area.",0,0

Placebo did not change either the LVM index or the 24-hour BP values in Group I and Group II. Diltiazem and lisinopril decreased the LVM index in both Group I and Group II, but 24-hour BP values decreased only in Group II. Lisinopril appeared to be more potent than diltiazem in the LVM regression. The slopes of the LVM index regression were not different between Groups I and II for each drug. Drug-induced changes of the LVM index were not correlated with blood pressure changes; In man (Group I), drug-induced regression of LVM can be achieved without any reduction in blood pressure. This can be explained by interaction with growth-promoting systems other than cardiac unloading. In addition, the similar LVK regression pattern observed in both Group I and Group II suggests that similar basic mechanisms may play a role in LVH regression in these two populations.",0,0

Previous data suggest that plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) may increase proportionally more than plasma ANP after AMI and in chronic heart failure. The diagnostic and prognostic value of plasma BNP as an indicator of left ventricular dysfunction and long-term survival after AMI relative to ANP and N-ANP has not yet been established; Venous blood samples for ANP, N-ANP, and BNP analysis were obtained from 131 patients with documented AMI at day 3 after symptom onset. Left ventricular ejection fraction was determined by echocardiography in a subsample of 79 patients. During the follow-up period (median, 1293 days), 28 cardiovascular and 3 non-cardiovascular deaths occurred. All three peptides were proven to be strong predictors of cardiovascular mortality by univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyzes (ANP: P < .0001; N-ANP: P = .0002; BNP: P < .0001). In a multivariate model, plasma BNP (P = .021) but not ANP (P = .638) or N-ANP (P = .782) provided additional prognostic information beyond left ventricular ejection fraction. Logistic regression analysis showed that ANP (P = .003) and N-ANP (P = .027) BNP (P = .14) were significantly associated with left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 45%; These results suggest that plasma BNP determination provides important, independent prognostic information after AMI.

Thirteen men with stable exertional angina were treated with oral ISDN (80 mg/d) for >3 weeks. After this period, the efficacy of a single oral administration of alacepril (50 mg) or placebo on exercise-induced angina and electrocardiographic changes was examined by the double-blind crossover treadmill exercise test.

Three groups of 6 hypertensive patients were enrolled [untreated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90-115 mm Hg]; normal kidney function [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) > 81 ml min-1 1.73 m-2], mild renal impairment (GFR 51-80 ml min-1 1.73 m-2), and moderate renal impairment (GFR 31-50 ml) ) min-1 1.73 m-2). The pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat and enalaprilat plus HCTZ correlate predictably with renal impairment, with increased plasma concentrations and decreased urinary elimination at low GFR values. Co-administration of HCTZ had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat in either group. We concluded that although the pharmacokinetics of both enalaprilat and HCTZ were related to renal function, HCTZ had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat and dose adjustment for both regimens should be based on renal function.",0,0

They were randomized to receive hydralazine slow-release 50 mg/chlortalidone 12.5 mg) for 6 months. Randomized blood pressure, non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), M-mode echocardiogram, plasma renin activity, and plasma catecholamines were evaluated before randomization and after 6 months of treatment. Both drugs significantly reduced daily and daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure, with no statistical differences between the two treatments. Lisinopril was significantly more effective than hydralazine at lowering nocturnal systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Plasma norepinephrine was significantly decreased with lisinopril and increased with hydralazine. Left ventricular mass was significantly reduced with lisinopril but not with hydralazine. The results of linear regression and multiple regression analysis suggested that lisinopril-induced reduction in both daytime and nighttime blood pressure may be responsible for the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas it may be the reason for the lack of regression in left ventricular hypertrophy during hydralazine treatment. mainly to reflex sympathetic activation induced by the drug.",0,0

This symptom is also frequently reported in patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as treatment for heart failure or hypertension, although the underlying mechanism is unknown. We investigated the possibility that the inflammatory peptide bradykinin, which is normally degraded by ACE, causes airway sensory nerve sensitization and increased cough reflex in conscious guinea pigs. Treatment of guinea pigs with captopril for two weeks resulted in an increased cough response to inhaled citric acid; this was prevented by concomitant treatment with the bradykinin receptor antagonist, inventionibant. A similar inventioniban-sensitive increase in citric acid-stimulated cough was seen in untreated animals after previous inhalation of bradykinin, but hypertonic saline-stimulated cough was unaffected. In in vitro electrophysiological studies, the responses of single vagal C fibers to capsaicin applied to the receptive areas of single fiber units in the trachea were also significantly increased after perfusion with bradykinin, while the responses of hypertonic saline A delta fiber were not affected. These results suggest that bradykinin-evoked sensitivity of airway sensory nerves may underlie the pathogenesis of ACE inhibitor cough. Bradykinin receptor antagonists may be useful in the treatment of the chronic cough associated with these and other inflammatory conditions.",0,0

Role of the renin-angiotensin system.,,"Hennes, M M; O'Shaughnessy, I M; Kelly, T M; LaBelle, P; Egan, B M; Kissebah, A H","Resistance to the capacity of insulin to suppress lipolysis may be an important link in the association between abdominal obesity and hypertension. Furthermore, a more active renin-angiotensin system in adipose tissue may contribute to insulin-resistant lipolysis in abdominally obese hypertensive individuals. We determined nonesterified fatty acid concentrations and turnover as well as lipid oxidation under basal conditions and during steady-state euglycemia with two levels of insulinemia (72 and 287 pmol/L) in lean normotensive, abdominally obese normotensive and abdominally obese hypertensive subjects. To evaluate the role of the renin-angiotensin system in determining the nonesterified fatty acid cycle, we repeated studies in abdominally obese hypertensive subjects after double-blind randomization for placebo or enalapril for 1 month each. The main findings were: (1) Unsterilized fatty acid flow was significantly higher in abdominal obese hypertensive subjects at both levels of insulinemia than in abdominally obese normotensive or lean normotensive subjects, during which it was significantly associated with both mean blood pressure and total systemic resistance. higher level of insulinemia. (2) Enalapril significantly improved insulin-resistant lipolysis in abdominally obese hypertensive subjects. The improvement in insulin suppressibility of non-esterified fatty acid efflux at high hormonal concentrations was positively correlated with the magnitude of the reduction in blood pressure. (3) Basal lipid oxidation and suppression in response to insulin was similarly impaired in both obese groups. Resistance to the antilipolytic effects of insulin is therefore a characteristic feature in abdominally obese hypertensive individuals and may be associated with high blood pressure in these individuals. A more active renin-angiotensin system may partly explain the insulin-resistant lipolysis in this form of hypertension.",0,0

A total of 2606 consecutive patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction corresponding to an ejection fraction of < or = 35% were identified. Of these patients, 1749 (67%) were randomly assigned to receive oral trandolapril or placebo starting from days 3 to 7 post-infarction. Follow-up was 2 to 4 years. Trandolapril reduced all-cause mortality with a relative risk reduction associated with trandolapril treatment of 0.78 (p = 0.0013). The benefit was seen 1 month after the treatment. Trandolapril also reduced cardiovascular death (relative risk 0.75, p = 0.001), sudden death (relative risk 0.76, p = 0.03) and progression to severe/resistant heart failure (relative risk 0.71, p = 0.003). Recurrent myocardial infarction (fatal or non-fatal) was not significantly reduced (relative risk 0.86, p = 0.29). More than 80% of patients in both treatment groups achieved the target dose of 4 mg trandolapril or placebo at the end of dose titration. About half of patients in both treatment groups stopped taking study drug before death or study closure. The need for open-label ACE inhibition was the reason for discontinuation of therapy for 48 and 75 patients in the trandolapril and placebo groups, respectively. In conclusion, long-term treatment with trandolapril significantly reduced mortality and morbidity in patients with reduced left ventricular function shortly after myocardial infarction. Most patients received the target dose of trandolapril 4 mg per day. The observed benefit is likely to reflect the benefit in clinical practice, as the majority of eligible patients were randomized and the difference between patients who dropped out of the trial to receive open-label ACE inhibition was modest.",1,1

Eleven patients discontinued because they were noncompliant, uncooperative, or acted (nine in the enalapril group and two in the placebo group). Two patients treated with enalapril were excluded from the study due to protocol deviations. More importantly, the statistical approach in this study evaluated all patients regardless of treatment duration. Treatment analysis, taking into account a mixed-effects linear model and number of observations per patient, showed that enalapril significantly reduced the rate of deterioration of kidney disease: glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.038), plasma creatinine equivalent (P = 0.017), or creatinine clearance (P = 0.08). 0.031).

Enalapril did not modulate fibrinogen, leukocyte count, or elastase, while B beta 30-43 peptide showed low levels, although the proportion of patients with values above the reference limit did not differ from placebo. In conclusion, while platelet function is activated in the first week after acute myocardial infarction in the 6-month period after acute myocardial infarction, fibrinogen and leukocyte functions continue to be activated for 6 months in a significant proportion of patients. These symptoms may indicate an ongoing atherosclerotic process. Enalapril has no significant effect on these reactivity.",0,0

An initial dose of 10 mg once daily was titrated as tolerated to 40 mg once daily. All patients received diuretic therapy; digoxin was optional. The primary endpoint was maximum cycling exercise time; A secondary endpoint was the occurrence of prospectively defined, sequential clinical events indicative of worsening of heart failure: death, study discontinuation, hospitalization, emergency room visits, and the need for additional diuretics.

At the same time, 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, echocardiographic study and plasma renin activity evaluation were performed on the patients. Lisinopril treatment increased plasma renin activity and improved 24-hour systolic and diastolic pressures (from 159 +/- 14 to 121 +/- 8 and 103 +/- 7 to 80 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively) and left ventricular reduced its mass index (from 159 +/- 33 to 134 +/- 26 g/m2); In addition, left ventricular mass normalization was achieved in 12 of 30 patients.

In the remaining 18 patients, power spectral measurements after treatment were slightly lower from baseline and even lower after drug discontinuation. Therefore, lisinopril treatment in hypertensive hypertrophic patients corrects the sympathovagal imbalance when left ventricular mass is normalized. In patients whose left ventricular mass does not normalize, discontinuation of the drug is followed by worsening of neural cardiac control.",0,0

However, clinical (9.8/1.6 mm Hg), 24-hour (2.1/1.1 mm Hg), and daytime (2.9/1.0 mm Hg) BPs were also decreased during placebo (P<.05, excluding daytime diastolic BP) ; these reductions represented 43/23%, 20/24% and 30/23% of the corresponding BP reduction during active treatment. After removing the placebo effects, the net BP reductions during active treatment were only 12.9/5.4, 8.3/3.4, and 6.8/3.2 mm Hg for clinical, 24-hour, and daytime BP, respectively. The effect of active treatment was also subject to diurnal variation (P<.05). Changes in hourly mean systolic and diastolic BP during placebo were 21% (median) (range, -1 to 42%) and 25% (-3 to 72%) of the corresponding changes during active treatment, respectively. In conclusion, the effect of antihypertensive treatment on BP, expressed in millimeters of mercury, is greater in the conventional measurement than in the outpatient setting. Regardless of whether BP is measured with a conventional sphygmomanometer or with outpatient monitoring, a significant portion of the long-term BP changes observed during active therapy can be attributed to placebo effects. Thus, unadjusted ambulatory monitoring for placebo or control observations, like conventional sphygmomanometer measurement, overestimates blood pressure responses in long-term clinical trials.",0,0

CONSENSUS II multiecho working group.,,"Bonarjee, V V; Carstensen, S; Caidahl, K; Nilsen, D W; Edner, M; Lindvall, K; Snapinn, S M; Berning, J","Beta-blockers reduce infarct size and improve survival after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition after MI also improves survival and may reduce left ventricular (LV) enlargement. We evaluated the effect of early enalapril treatment on LV volumes and ejection fraction (EF) in patients undergoing concomitant beta-blockade after MI. Intravenous enalaprilat or placebo was administered 24 hours after MI and continued orally for 6 months. LV volumes were evaluated by echocardiography at 3 +/- 2 days, 1 and 6 months after MI. Change in LV diastolic volume during the first month was attenuated with enalapril (2.7 vs placebo change 6.5 ml/m2; p < 0.05) and significantly lower LV diastolic and systolic volumes were observed with enalapril treatment at 1 month compared to placebo (enalapril 47.21 vs. 23.9). versus placebo 53.1/29.2 ml/m2; p < 0.05) and at 6 months (enalapril 47.9/24.8 vs. placebo 53.8/29.6 ml/m2; p < 0.05). EF was also significantly higher in these patients 1 month after MI (enalapril 50.4% vs. placebo 46.4%; p < 0.05). Our history shows that early treatment with enalapril reduces LV volume expansion and maintains lower LV volumes and higher EF in patients undergoing concomitant beta-blockade after MI. A possible additive effect of combined therapy should be considered prospectively.",1,1

The cardiorespiratory effects of long-term, continuous IV administration of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat have been studied. 2. Forty-five consecutive critically ill patients suffering from trauma or postoperative complications were randomly assigned to three groups (15 patients in each group) who received either 0.25 mg h-1 or 0.50 mg h-1 saline solution as enalaprilat or placebo, respectively (= control group). The infusion was continued for 5 days. 3. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were intensively monitored at admission (= 'baseline' values) and daily for the next 5 days. 4. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was significantly reduced in patients treated with enalaprilat alone, while heart rate (HR) remained unchanged in these patients. 5. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) enalaprilat (0.50 mg h-1: PAP (mean +/- sd) decreased from 28.0 +/- 4.1 to 24.0 +/- 3.0 mm Hg) ) and was significantly lower than the control group. Cardiac index (CI), oxygen consumption (VO2I), and oxygen delivery (DO2I) were significantly reduced in the untreated control group, which was blunted by enalaprilat infusion. Oxygen extraction (O2-extr) increased in both enalaprilat groups (0.25 mg h-1: 26.1% +/- 5.5 to 30.4 +/- 4.0; 0.50 mg h-1: 25 .2 +/- 5.6 to 30.9 +/- 4.4 %) and in control patients. 6. Right ventricular hemodynamics improved with enalaprilat infusion (0.50 mg h-1: RVEF increased from 40.0 +/- 3.5 to 45.5% +/- 4.0). Lactate plasma concentrations were decreased in the group containing 0.50 mg h-1 enalaprilat (1.9 +/- 1.0 to 1.3 +/- 0.3 mg dl-1) and increased in control patients. 7. Continuous infusion of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat demonstrated beneficial cardiorespiratory effects in critically ill patients. The widespread risk of perfusion altered by low CI, DO2, VO2, O2-extra, and increased lactate concentration was blunted by enalaprilat infusion. 8. A dose of 0.25 mg h-1 also showed beneficial hemodynamic effects in critically ill patients, although 0.5 mg h-1 enalaprilat was most effective.",0,0

Improvement of cough in eight hypertensive patients with ACE inhibitor-induced cough was studied in a prospective observational study over a 4-week period. Resolution of the cough was measured at baseline and on days 3, 7, 14, and 28 with visual analog scales and a questionnaire. In addition, changes in cough sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin and skin responses to bradykinin and substance-P were measured at the same time points. 2. All patients noted significant subjective improvement in cough severity and cough questionnaire scores for nocturnal awakening, and visual analog scales for cough severity and frequency (all P < 0.0005 for trend 0-28 days). Significant changes in subjective measures were noted between 3 and 7 days for most measurements, but further reductions were observed up to day 28 (all P < 0.01 days 28 and day 0). 3. Sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin decreased during the 28-day study after stopping enalapril. The potency of capsaicin from day 0 was reduced to 0.25 (95% CI 0.07-0.87) at day 14 and to 0.20 (95% CI 0.06-0.67) at 28 days. 4. After stopping enalapril, there was a very significant reduction in the area of puffiness produced by intradermal bradykinin, with most of the effect seen on day 3 (P < 0.0005). The swelling area of the intradermal substance-P also decreased over time after stopping enalapril, but no significant changes were observed until day 14 (P < 0.01). 5. Multiple regression analysis of decline rates for subjective and objective measures of cough showed significant associations between response to inhaled capsaicin and VAS scores for cough severity (P = 0.005) and cough frequency (P = 0.011). Capsaicin response was not significantly associated with the severity of cough as measured by the self-administered questionnaire. 6. There was a significant correlation between bradykinin response and VAS scores for cough frequency (P < 0.04) and cough severity (P < 0.05), but not with cough or capsaicin response by questionnaire. Response to Item-P was not significantly associated with any of the cough measures. 7. Cough caused by Enalapril improved significantly within 14 days, but took up to 28 days to resolve.

This study examines cough recorded in Prescription Event Monitoring (PEM) of four ACE inhibitors. Particular attention was paid to the enalapril study because the causal relationship between the drug, cough and ACE inhibitors was followed before it was widely accepted. RESULTS. Various factors obscuring the causal relationship in individual cases were also found to be a barrier in PEM. For example, cough was a common and non-serious event and underreported in the PEM study on enalapril and the rate was not strikingly different from that recorded for other drugs. Cough induced by ACE inhibitors has several characteristics that reduce the chance of a recognizable ""signal"". The original questionnaires returned from physicians were re-examined in the PEM study of Enalapril. The observation that the rate of cough decreased after enalapril was stopped, more than increased after initiation, provided the best evidence for causation, as this was unaffected by many biases, such as publicity that occurred before the physicians participating in the PEM completed subsequent reports.",0,0

Baseline measurements were made for plasma renin activity (PRA), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR). Captopril (12.5 mg) was administered sublingually with dibasic potassium phosphate maintaining salivary pH at 7 or orally with 100 ml of water. Further BP, HR measurements and venous blood samples were taken over a 3-hour period after drug administration. Blood samples were analyzed for captopril and PRA levels; The tmax after buffered sublingual administration of captopril ranging from 40-60 minutes (median = 40 minutes) was significantly shorter than peroral administration (range 60-120 minutes, median = 90 minutes). Cmax was slightly higher after peroral administration after buffered sublingual, with mean values of 108.2 vs. 94.0 ng.ml-1. AUC values were similar after both routes of administration. The systolic and diastolic BP-time profiles for each method of administration were significantly different, ie sublingual administration resulted in an earlier reduction in BP, but HR did not differ significantly between the two routes; The data show that this new method of administration of captopril results in an increased rate but an unchanged extent of captopril absorption; this suggests a modest therapeutic advantage with the use of buffered sublingual captopril if a rapid reduction in blood pressure is required.",0,0

Five patients (group II) who did not experience ACEI-related cough were also questioned as controls. Results revealed that two patients in group I (40%) showed BHR with mean PC20 in 15 mg/ml methacholine solution. On the other hand, none of the patients in group II disclosed BHR.

In the airways, ACE degrades substance P, so the cough mechanism may be related to this peptide; Nine patients who developed cough while taking the ACE inhibitor enalapril (2.5 or 5.0 mg/day) for hypertension and five patients who did not develop cough were included in the study. No subjects had respiratory disease and all subjects had normal respiratory function. One month after stopping enalapril, inhalation of hypertonic saline (4%) was performed using an ultrasonic nebulizer for 15-30 minutes to induce sputum. The concentration of substance P in the sputum sample was measured by radioimmunoassay. Enalapril was re-administered for 1-2 weeks in four of nine patients with cough, and the concentration of substance P in the induced sputum was measured again. One month after discontinuation of enalapril, the mean (SE) concentration of substance P in the sputum of the coughing group was 16.6 (3.0) fmol/ml, which was significantly higher than that in subjects without cough (0.9 (0.5) fmol/ml). ).

A total of 7,001 consecutive enzyme-confirmed AMIs (6,676 patients) were screened for entry into the TRandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study. Echocardiographic estimates of LV systolic function, which were determined as medical history, wall motion index, infarct complications, and survival, were recorded for all patients. To examine the significance and age-independent wall motion index of congestive heart failure, we applied Cox proportional hazards models across 4 different age strata (< or = 55 years, 56 to 65 years, 66 to 75 years, and >75 years). . The 1-year mortality rates for patients in these strata were 5%, 11%, 21%, and 32%, respectively. Three-year mortality rates were 11%, 20%, 34% and 55%, respectively.

It shows more than 5% and simultaneous severe to moderate hyperdipsia. The first single dose of 1 mg cilazapril given at the end of the HD session resulted in a marked improvement in interdialysis thirst scores and a concomitant decrease in plasma angiotensin II (AII) concentration due to inhibition of ACE activity. Interdialysis body weight gain was significantly lower during the cilazapril treatment period than during the untreated period. None of the other parameters, including blood pressure, plasma osmolarity, and serum Na and K concentration, were different with the treatment in the untreated period. Available data help explain the potential pharmacological action of AII in thirst physiology and suggest that cilazapril can effectively alleviate dialysis-associated hyperdipsia, at least in some circumstances. The mechanism by which ACE-I exerts an antidipsogenic effect may be explained in part by the reduction in plasma concentration of AII as a result of ACE inhibition.",0,0

These results formed the basis for this double-blind, parallel group study to elucidate the metabolic effects of 6 months of treatment with doxazosin and enalapril in patients with both essential hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia. Insulin sensitivity was measured using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp method. The hemodynamic assessment included office and ambulatory blood pressure measurements and ultrasonic measurements of femoral artery blood flow. Both drugs significantly reduced both office BP and 24-hour ambulatory BP. Office systolic blood pressure was significantly better reduced with enalapril. Doxazosin, in contrast to enalapril, significantly improved insulin sensitivity (21%, P = .02). It also reduced serum triglycerides (23%, P = .01), VLDL triglycerides (30%, P = .008) and VLDL cholesterol (24%, P = .02). This lipid-lowering effect of doxazosin was accompanied by an increase in both plasma lipoprotein lipase activity and the elimination rate of the intravenous fat emulsion load. Neither treatment significantly increased femoral artery blood flow. It is speculated that without measurably increasing blood flow in conduit vessels, such as the femoral artery, doxazosin, by capillary uptake, it may prolong the transit time of blood over the muscle bed, which may explain the increased glucose excretion and increased lipoprotein lipase activity.",0,0

In essential hypertensives (0.84 mg/kg over 10 minutes) with dipipyridamole echocardiography stress test (DET) (DET+, n = 8) and no ST-segment depression greater than 0.1 mV (DET-, n = 8) during intravenous dipyridamole infusion, we endothelium examined forearm blood flow (FBF, venous plethysmography, mL/100) modifications induced by intrabrachial acetylcholine (Ach) (0.15, 0.45, 1.5, 4.5, 15 micrograms/100 mL/min x 5 minutes), a dependent vasodilator. and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (1, 2, 4 micrograms/100 mL/min x 5 min each), a smooth muscle cell relaxant compound. Minimal forearm vascular resistance (MFVR), an index of arteriolar structural changes, was also calculated. Both Ach and SNP caused greater vasodilation in DET- compared with DET+, while MFVRs were lower in DET- compared with DET+. After treatment, both DET+ and DET- patients showed a significant and similar reduction in blood pressure and left ventricular mass index, whereas vasodilation with acetylcholine and sodium nitropruss increased only in the DET+ group. In addition, forearm minimal vascular resistances were significantly reduced in DET+ patients who showed disappearance of dipyridamole-only ischemic-like ST-segment depression. In conclusion, these data confirm that essential hypertensive patients with microvascular coronary disease are characterized by the presence of structural changes in the forearm vascular bed.

The primary efficacy parameters were response to treatment in terms of hypertensive response categories, as well as change in trough systolic and diastolic blood pressure; A gradual decrease in mean diastolic blood pressure while sitting was observed in all patients treated from weeks 1 to 12 (10-29 mmHg for the losartan regimen and 14-32 mmHg for the enalapril regimen). At week 4, a significant number of patients remained on losartan (52%) or enalapril (72%) starting dose or double dose monotherapy. Blood pressure curves for each treatment paralleled over time. The enalapril-based regimen produced a statistically significantly greater reduction in blood pressure than the losartan-based regimen, but the mean differences in blood pressure response between the two treatment groups were small. Based on a sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or a decrease in blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg, 98% of patients assigned to the losartan regimen and 100% of patients assigned to the enalapril regimen had a satisfactory response with the following regimen. one to three antihypertensive drugs. The most common adverse event in both treatment groups was headache (22% of patients assigned to the losartan regimen and 20% of patients assigned to the enalapril regimen); In this study, the losartan-based regimen effectively lowered blood pressure, was generally well tolerated, and was overall similar to the enalapril-based regimen in the treatment of patients with severe hypertension.",0,0

1900,8733032,Does high salt intake cause hyperfiltration in patients with essential hypertension?,,"Mallamaci, F; Leonardis, D; Bellizzi, V; Zoccali, C","In animal models of salt-dependent hypertension, hyperfiltration is associated with a more rapid decline in renal function, and there is evidence that increased creatinine clearance in the hypertensive human is a marker of early hypertensive nephropathy. We examined the effect of salt intake on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (Creatinine Clearance) in 14 patients with mild hypertension. Each patient was studied in random order and according to the crossover design at habitual salt intake, high salt intake (ie, habitual +50/100 mmol/day), and low salt intake (habitual -50/100 mmol/day). Protein, calcium, and potassium intake were fixed over the three study periods. The control group consisted of seven healthy individuals. High salt intake resulted in a significant increase (P < 0.01) in 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) and expected suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone. Seven patients were classified as salt-sensitive. GFR was significantly higher (P < 0.01) at high salt intake (125 +/- 10 ml/min) than usual (113 +/- 7 ml/min) and low salt intake (97 +/- 6 ml/min) . min). Total urinary salt excretion was significantly associated with GFR (P < 0.01 by correlation analysis for repeated observations), and the slope of this association predicted that a 100 mmol/day increase in salt intake was associated with a 14.6 ml/min increase in salt intake. GFR. The relationship between GFR and 24-hour urinary salt in salt-sensitive patients was not different from that in salt-resistant patients. The GFR response to salt loading was largely independent of the renin-aldosterone system. No changes in arterial pressure or GFR were observed in healthy subjects. At constant protein intake, changes in salt intake over the physiological range are associated with significant GFR variations in mildly hypertensives. In mild hypertension, high salt intake may be a contributing factor to nephronic aging in patients with essential hypertension, independent of the influence of arterial pressure, as long as hyperfiltration is an indicator of impaired renal function.",0,0

The aim of treatment was to reduce the sitting DBP to <90 mm Hg, 24-30 hours after the last dose of lisinopril or 12-18 hours after the last dose of nifedipine, and to evaluate the effect of these treatments on BAE over 12 years of age. months. The effect of the two treatments on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) was also evaluated in a subset of patients. Management of diabetes with oral hypoglycemic drugs, diet, and insulin, alone or in combination, was allowed. The median UAE on lisinopril decreased from 65.5 (range 20-297) micrograms/min at baseline to 39.0 (2-510) micrograms/min after 12 months. On nifedipine, the median UAE decreased from 63.0 (range 20-289) micrograms/min at baseline to 58.0 (9-1192) micrograms/min after 12 months.

In 66 hypertensive patients (diastolic pressure > 95 mmHg at conventional measurement), ambulatory blood pressure was measured with placebo at baseline and 2 months later, while patients received lisinopril 10 mg once daily between 7 PM and 11 PM. Curves were obtained by subtracting baseline blood pressure from the corresponding value at 2 months for all time intervals considered in the diurnal treatment effect analysis. To calculate the surface ratio, the area under the treatment effect curve was divided by the product of the maximum blood pressure lowering effect and the dosing interval (24 hours). The reproducibility of the pit-to-peak and surface ratios was investigated by Bland and Altman techniques. At 2 months, lisinopril reduced 24-hour pressure 13 +/- 16 mmHg systolic and 8 +/- 8 mmHg diastolic (p < 0.001) (+/- standard deviation). According to the usual approach, the trough-to-peak ratio was 0.7 for systolic and diastolic pressure, ignoring inter-individual variability. When investigated daily treatment effects curves in individual patients with 1-hour resolution, the median trough-peak ratio was 0.30 for systolic pressure (5th to 95th percentile range [PI]: -0.51, 0.82) and 0.28 for diastolic pressure (PI: -0.37, 0.78); The corresponding values for the surface ratio were 0.33 (PI: 0.03, 0.58) and 0.30 (PI: -0.01, 0.55). Likewise, bottom-to-peak ratios and surface ratios became larger as individual blood pressure profiles were gradually smoothed out by replacing 1-hour averages with 2-hour moving averages, 2-hour averages, 3-hour moving averages, or 3-hour averages. . The distributions of pit-to-peak ratios and surface ratios were not normal in 37 of 40 samples (p < 0.001, Shapiro-Wilk test). Consistency for the surface was higher than for the bottom-to-top ratios (p < 0.001). The within-subject reproducibility of the surface ratios tended to be superior to that of the respective bottom-to-top ratios.

Following a double-blind, randomized crossover design, these parameters were measured after a 4-week break-in period, after 8 weeks of lisinopril or placebo, and after an additional 8 weeks of placebo or lisinopril. In addition, physical fitness level was estimated using the Conconi bicycle ergometer test. The SI was low in this study population (13.3 x 10(-4).min-1.mU-1.l-1 versus 5.6 in normal lean control subjects). The placebo acclimation phase did not differ between the lisinopril phase and the placebo transition phase (5.8, 5.5 and 5.4 x 10(-4).min-1.mU-1.l-1, respectively). In addition, there were no significant changes in fasting plasma insulin and glucose, areas under the glucose and insulin curves, rate of glucose loss, serum total triglycerides, and cholesterol or lipoprotein cholesterol fractions during lisinopril administration. At rest, heart rate, body weight, and anaerobic threshold remained constant throughout the study. Concordance as assessed by pill count exceeded 90% at all visits.

A total of 10,377 consecutive patients with essential hypertension were recruited for one-year follow-up. Overall, 37% of physicians who agreed to participate in the study actually enrolled at least one patient. One-third of the enrolling physicians and two-thirds of the patients studied were included in the study. Approximately 15% of the participating men and 27% of the women were over 70 years of age. Newly diagnosed hypertensives made up 22% of the study group, highest in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, while 53% were established hypertensives for two or more years, with the rate highest in Germany and Belgium. There were significant differences between participating countries in the concomitant treatment these patients received for hypertension, with two or more concomitant treatments being most common in Germany and Belgium. There were significant differences in therapies for concomitant diseases between participating countries, reflecting both standard therapeutic practice in local areas and differences in the marketing of drugs in different countries.

The primary objective was to evaluate changes in exercise tolerance and the secondary objective was to evaluate cardiovascular signs and symptoms, quality of life, ejection fraction, and chest X-ray findings. Exercise tolerance increased in all groups; however, no statistically significant difference was found between any of the groups. There was a statistically significant reduction in mortality and a trend towards reduced length of hospital stay as well as serious cardiovascular adverse events in the pooled spirapril groups compared to placebo. These effects and improvements in pulmonary congestion appear to be dose-dependent. In patients with moderate to severe heart failure, the combination with first generation calcium channel blockers had an adverse effect on exercise capacity and clinical parameters. Spirapril may be an effective alternative to enalapril in the treatment of patients with CHF. The role of exercise tolerance testing in determining the efficacy of ACEIs in CHF and the widespread use of nifedipine in CHF is questioned.",1,0

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition starting in the subacute or late phase after myocardial infarction has been shown to improve prognosis; In the Captopril and Thrombolysis Study, 298 patients with first anterior myocardial infarction treated with intravenous streptokinase were randomized to receive oral captopril (25 mg three times daily) or placebo. Left ventricular volume index was evaluated by two-dimensional echocardiography within 24 hours, on days 3, 10, and 90, and 1 year later; After 12 months, a small but significant increase in left ventricular volume indices was observed. Using a random coefficient model, no significant treatment effect on left ventricular volumes could be detected. In contrast, the occurrence of left ventricular dilatation was significantly lower in captopril-treated patients when survival models were used (p = 0.018). In addition, the incidence of heart failure was lower in the captopril group (p < 0.03). This effect appeared early and was most pronounced in patients with medium-sized infarctions (p = 0.04) and was not present in large infarcts; Very early treatment with captopril after myocardial infarction significantly reduces the occurrence of early dilatation and progression to heart failure. These data highlight the importance of early treatment. In addition, patients with moderate infarct size benefit most from this treatment strategy.",1,1

TREND (Trial on Endothelial Dysfunction) investigated whether quinapril could ameliorate endothelial dysfunction in normotensive patients with coronary artery disease and without heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or major lipid abnormalities so that confounding variables affecting endothelial dysfunction could be minimized; Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design, we measured the effects of quinapril (40 mg daily) on coronary artery diameter responses to acetylcholine using quantitative coronary angiography. The primary response variable was the net change in acetylcholine-induced narrowing of target segments between baseline (pre-randomization) and 6-month follow-up angiograms. Constrictive responses to acetylcholine were comparable at baseline in the placebo (n = 54) and quinapril (n = 51) groups.

However, limited data are available on the effects of ACE inhibitors on the onset and progression of CHF in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This study was performed as a substudy of the Long-Term Assessment of Myocardial Infarction Survival study and included 1,146 patients with anterior wall AMI who did not undergo thrombolysis and excluded patients with a previous history of CHF or clinical manifestations at presentation. Patients were randomly assigned to either zofenopril (7.5 to 30 mg twice daily) or placebo treatment for a cumulative 6-week period. The prevalence of mild to moderate or severe CHF was the main target and was assessed 6 weeks and 1 year after AMI. The overall prevalence of CHF was not reduced by zofenopril after both 6 weeks and 12 months. Conversely, the prevalence of severe CHF (1.6% vs. 2.6%: risk reduction 55.5%; 95% confidence interval 9 to 63; p = 0.0325) and the combined occurrence of death or severe CHF (4.8% vs. 8.2%: risk decrease 59% ; 95% confidence interval 11 to 71; p = 0.024) decreased after 6 weeks of treatment with zofenopril. In addition, the percentage of patients who experienced worsening to severe CHF after 1 year was significantly reduced with zofenopril (24.3% versus 11.0%; p = 0.001).

A previous Left Ventricular Dysfunction Study (SOLVD) study suggested that neurohumoral activation precedes the development of symptoms, as demonstrated by increased neurohormonal levels in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. However, the significance of this early neurohumoral activation is unclear. The objectives of this study were to determine the prognostic significance of plasma norepinephrine (PNE) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) plasma concentrations and renin activity (PRA) in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. PNE and PRA were measured prior to randomization in 514 patients with left ventricular ejection fractions < or = 35%, not requiring treatment for congestive heart failure, and enrolled in the SOLVD Prevention Trial.

PNE was the strongest predictor of clinical events in this patient population. PNE levels above a median of 393 pg/mL were associated with a relative risk of 2.59 (P = .002) for all-cause death, 2.55 (P = .003) for cardiovascular death, and 2.55 (P = .005) for hospitalization. 1.88 (P = .002) for heart failure development, 1.92 (P = .001) for ischemic events, and 2.59 (P = .005) for myocardial infarction. When the analysis included only patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction, PNE remained the strongest predictor for all-cause mortality and ischemic events. Increases in other neurohormonal levels were not useful in predicting the subsequent development of clinical events; Elevated PNE levels in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction predict all-cause and cardiovascular death and the development of clinical events related to heart failure or the onset of acute ischemic syndromes.

1936,8783779,Effect of quinapril on albumin excretion rate in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Multicenter Working Group.,,"Larochelle, P","Correlations between albumin excretion rate (AER) and ambulatory and transient blood pressure have been reported in patients with essential hypertension. Microalbuminuria has been implicated as a possible predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of quinapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with high tissue affinity for the enzyme, on AER in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and no evidence of diabetes mellitus. In this 12-week, 24-center study, 213 patients were administered quinapril and titrated to 10, 20, or 40 mg/day alone or 20 mg/day plus 12.5 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide. Overall, blood pressure was reduced from 155.2 +/- 18.1/101.8 +/- 6.7 mm HG (mean +/- SD) to 144.4 +/- 17.8/92.3 +/- 8.9 mm HG (P = .0001) and AER decreased from 20.6 +/- 24.3 mg/24 hours to 14.5 +/- 15.4 mg/24 hours (P = .0001). BP reductions were significant in all age groups. The AER at the endpoint was reduced from 32.5 +/- 45.0 mg/24 h, 19.1 +/- 20.9 mg/24 h and 16.1 +/- 16.9 to 37.5% in the elderly, 29.8% in the middle-aged and 11.8% in the young patients. mg/24 hours, respectively. The AER was reduced in 60% of patients with normal (0 to 30 mg/24 hours), 79% of those with microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg/24 hours), and 90% of those with proteinuria. > 300 mg/24 h) at baseline. Baseline log-AER was associated with SBP (P = .0126, R = 0.19) and creatinine clearance (P = .026, R = 0.17), while endpoint log-AER was associated with SBP (P = .0015, R = 0.25) and DBP (P = .03, R = 0.17). In summary, we show that in a large group of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and no evidence of diabetes mellitus, quinapril not only significantly lowers blood pressure, but also reduces microalbuminuria.",0,0
1937,8785399,Mechanism of the antiproteinuric effect of cyclosporine in membranous nephropathy.,,"Ambalavanan, S; Fauvel, J P; Sibley, R K; Myers, B D","Forty-one patients with nephrotic syndrome and biopsy-proven membranous nephropathy were administered cyclosporine (CsA; 4 to 5 mg/kg/day) for 3 to 6 months. Differential solute clearances were used to assess glomerular function before and after treatment. CsA reduced the median proteinuria from 7.3 to 3.2 g/24 hours (P < 0.0001) by 56%. The corresponding mean increases in serum albumin, immunoglobulin G, and oncotic pressure were 31%, 32%, and 26%, respectively (all P < 0.0001). Arterial pressure, GFR, and renal plasma flow remained constant, but CsA dextran normalized the elimination curve and reduced the calculated fraction of shunt-like pores by 25% (P < 0.05). In 14 cases, a crossover design was used to randomly assign patients to 3 months of CsA instead of 3 months of enalapril (10 to 30 mg daily) with a washout interval of 1 month. Although enalapril reduced arterial pressure by 8 mm Hg (P < 0.01), it had no effect on proteinuria, plasma protein composition, filtration dynamics, or dextran elimination (all P = not significant). The CsA dependence of proteinuria, indicated by relapsing nephrosis after discontinuation of CsA, required additional courses of CsA to maintain proteinuria subnephrotic in most patients. In six patients whose GFR decreased during prolonged CsA therapy, repeat biopsy showed more prominent immune deposits and a thicker glomerular basement membrane than at baseline. It was concluded: (1) CsA partially reduces proteinuria in MN by increasing barrier size selectivity; (2) the lack of comparable efficacy of enalapril suggests that the antiproteinuric effect of CsA is related to its immunosuppressive rather than glomerulodepressor properties; however, (3) CsA evaluated by repeat biopsy does not prevent ongoing autoantibody formation in this disease.",0,0
1938,8785466,ACE inhibitors in elderly patients with hypertension. Special considerations.,,"Ravid, M; Ravid, D","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have emerged as the first-choice class of antihypertensive and vasodilator agents for the treatment of elderly patients with hypertension. Normotensive patients with diabetes mellitus with evidence of congestive heart failure, post-anterior myocardial infarction, or microangiopathy will also benefit from sustained ACE inhibition. Long-term use of ACE inhibitors is associated with better survival and reduced cardiovascular, cerebral and renal morbidity in these patients. In elderly atherosclerotic patients, these agents provide good control of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and peripheral resistance while remarkably preserving vital organ perfusion and providing infrequent adverse effects. The efficacy of ACE inhibitors is limited when used as monotherapy. However, there are advantages to using them in combination with other drugs, especially thiazide diuretics, nitrates and calcium antagonists. Thus, kidney function is preserved and left heart hypertrophy is prevented. There are no major differences between the various ACE inhibitors, and drug choice is largely a matter of personal preference.",0,0
1939,8785469,The changing face of hypertension and antihypertensive agents.,,"Kitler, M E","In summary, much needs to be done by both patients and healthcare providers to encourage thinking in terms of the disease risks and benefits of medical care, including pharmaceutical options. Healthcare professionals have been relatively ineffective patient educators, perhaps still because of the old ""doctor knows best"" paternalism. In addition, insufficient attention has been paid to the development of communication skills of health professionals. Most likely, one of the reasons is pressure from health professionals to control costs, which limits the time they spend consulting patients. Even less than ideal fit has been reported in large-scale trials. For example, 90% concordance was reported in the SHEP study (perhaps due to patient selection), but in Studies Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), only 80% concordance was achieved. Poor adherence to long-term therapy, both lifestyle changes and pharmacological therapy, has been identified as the main cause of inadequate control of high blood pressure; some sources claim that only 25% of all hypertensive patients have controlled BP. Therefore, planned patient education studies should be conducted as it can significantly improve blood pressure control and reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality. To achieve this, the patient must be an active participant in the planned regimen and not remain a passive recipient (table III).",0,0

Adverse reactions, drug interactions, and dosing guidelines are reviewed, as well as pharmacokinetic data and clinical trials; A MEDLINE search of the English literature published from 1966 to 1995 was performed. In addition, Merck and Co. has provided bibliographic data on file for losartan; Emphasis is placed on clinical and pharmacokinetic studies in humans. Controlled, double-blind studies were evaluated to evaluate the efficacy and side-effect profile of losartan; Losartan is a non-peptide competitive antagonist of the type I angiotensin II receptor. In comparative clinical studies, losartan appears to have antihypertensive efficacy similar to that of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Losartan is well tolerated with a placebo-like side-effect profile and a lower incidence of cough compared to ACE inhibitors. A combination product of losartan 50 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg has also been approved for the treatment of hypertension. The combination product is not indicated for initial therapy, but is recommended for patients who do not respond adequately to losartan monotherapy. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists are also under investigation for beneficial effects in patients with ventricular hypertrophy, kidney disease, and heart failure. Losartan, the first angiotensin II receptor antagonist approved for use in the USA, appears to be an effective new antihypertensive agent with a placebo-like side-effect profile. Losartan may be an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. However, the effect of losartan on mortality has not yet been evaluated. The role of angiotensin II receptor antagonists in areas such as ventricular hypertrophy, renal function and heart failure has not yet been established.",0,0

Two hundred patients who did not respond adequately to 4-week monotherapy with HCTZ sitting diastolic blood pressures between 95 and 114 mm Hg entered the 8-week double-blind period. Patients were randomized to placebo or moexipril 3.75, 7.5, or 15 mg once daily as adjunctive therapy to open-label HCTZ 25 mg. Blood pressure and heart rate measurements were taken at biweekly visits and the occurrence of adverse experiences was documented. At the 8-week endpoint, patients receiving moexipril 3.75, 7.5, and 15 mg compared to placebo had significantly greater adjusted mean reductions from baseline (p = 0.003) (-8.4, -8.8, and -8.9 versus -4.6 mm Hg). No significant difference was observed between the three dose levels of moexipril. Moexipril was generally well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events for moexipril and placebo were headache, flu syndrome, and dizziness (6, 7.5 vs 4.0, 4%).

In the peripheral venous blood of 24 essential hypertensive subjects before and 3 hours after administration of 50 mg of captopril. Of the 24 patients, 11 completed a 6-month treatment period with captopril monotherapy (50 mg twice daily). The hemodynamic and hormonal response produced by the last 50 mg dose of captopril was again determined in 11 subjects who maintained blood pressure control with captopril monotherapy for 6 months; The reduction in blood pressure at 3 hours post-drug ingestion was comparable for the first and last 50 mg dose of captopril. Although initial response to captopril only increased plasma levels of Ang I, response to the last dose of the drug (6 months later) resulted in significantly higher Ang I and Ang-(1-7) levels. Neither acute nor chronic treatment with captopril had a significant effect on plasma concentrations of Ang II. Although plasma prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha levels were not altered with initial exposure to captopril, concentrations of 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha, but not prostaglandin E2, were significantly increased in subjects treated with the inhibitor for 6 months. A negative correlation was also demonstrated between diastolic blood pressure and plasma Ang-(1-7) levels in 11 essential hypertensive subjects whose blood pressure was controlled with captopril monotherapy. Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme by captopril had a significant effect on blood pressure that was not directly explained by suppression of plasma Ang II levels. Continuous treatment with captopril revealed the contribution of Ang-(1-7) and prostacyclin to the antihypertensive effects of this drug.",0,0

We obtained a gluteal skin biopsy sample before starting treatment to investigate the morphology and function of the subcutaneous small artery (approximately 200 to 400 microns in diameter). Patients then received antihypertensive therapy with a combination of spirapril (3 or 6 mg) and isradipine (2.5 or 5 mg). Echocardiographic recordings were made 6 months and 1 year later and the last biopsy was taken 1 year later. After 1 year, blood pressure significantly decreased to 142 +/- 3/ 90 +/- 1 mm Hg (P < .001) and left ventricular mass index significantly increased to 105.3 +/- 5.8 g/m2 (P < . 001). The baseline media-lumen ratio (7.64% +/- 0.48%) was not significantly reduced (7.21% +/- 0.55%), although there was a reduction in 7 of 12 evaluable patients. Norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction was markedly reduced after 1 year. In conclusion, a significant reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy was achieved after 1 year of treatment with spirapril and isradipine, while a similar reduction in medial thickness relative to the lumen diameter of subcutaneous small arteries was not observed in all patients.

1944,8794833,Lisinopril reverses left ventricular hypertrophy through improved aortic compliance.,,"Shimamoto, H; Shimamoto, Y","We treated 38 essential hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy with nifedipine or lisinopril. The study had a single-blind crossover design; Nifedipine or lisinopril was given for the first 24 weeks, and then patients were switched to another antihypertensive agent for another 24 weeks. Both nifedipine and lisinopril reduced mean arterial pressure equally significantly. Although lisinopril lowered the left ventricular mass index more rapidly than nifedipine, 48 weeks of antihypertensive treatment with nifedipine or lisinopril reduced the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy to the same level. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy may be mainly due to the reduction in mean arterial pressure during 24 weeks of nifedipine treatment and the improvement of aortic compliance during treatment with lisinopril. Both nifedipine and lisinopril are effective in reversing hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy; however, agents have different effects on hemodynamic factors.",0,0

A 24-week study in 195 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension [supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) > or = 95 to < or = 110 mm Hg]. After discontinuing all previous antihypertensive drugs, patients received a placebo baseline period of 4-6 weeks followed by 24-week randomized treatment with active compounds administered by a double-artificial technique. The dose of fosinopril is 20 mg, which can be increased to 40 mg after 8 weeks (average 25.6 mg); enalapril was 10 mg and can be increased to 20 mg after 8 weeks (mean 12.9 mg). After 16 weeks, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg could be added and administered to 27% of patients in the fosinopril group and 30% of patients in the enalapril group.

SSDP decreased from 100 to 89 mm Hg (p < 0.01) in the fosinopril group and from 100 to 92 mm Hg (p < 0.01) in the enalapril group. Over the study period, fosinopril numerically reduced SSBP and SDBP by 0-3 mm Hg over enalapril. Adverse events (AE) resulted in discontinuation of study drug in 8 patients in the fosinopril group and 14 patients in the enalapril group (NS). The number of reported AEs was not statistically different in the two groups. Inhibition of ACE was evaluated in a subgroup of patients (n = 26, 13 in each group). Fosinopril caused greater ACE inhibition that was statistically significant at the doses used in this study. Both fosinopril and enalapril caused statistically significant reductions in BP of similar size, and both agents were well tolerated.

1947,8800625,risk-benefit assessment of ACE inhibitor therapy after myocardial infarction.,,"Borghi, C; Ambrosioni, E","The use of ACE inhibitors in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) has been the subject of many studies in recent years. These studies have demonstrated the capacity of these agents to improve both survival and morbidity in MI patients. However, it has been shown that the use of ACE inhibitors in MI patients can lower blood pressure (BP) and thus compromise the ischemic myocardium. A significant reduction in systemic BP was demonstrated in all studies of ACE inhibitors in MI patients, but no association was found between the occurrence of hypotension and a worse clinical outcome. An increased risk of death has been observed only in association with severe and sudden hypotension, the occurrence of which could be largely avoided by administration of the ACE inhibitor according to the incremental dose-titration scheme. Conversely, a certain degree of prolonged BP reduction may result in some beneficial effects in patients with MI and may contribute to the lower incidence of re-infarction observed in patients with acute MI who receive long-term treatment with captopril. Since the renin-angiotensin system is strictly related to renal function, its blockage by an ACE inhibitor may cause some degree of renal dysfunction, particularly in patients with MI and impaired ventricular function. Current results from large-scale studies suggest that abnormalities in kidney function (ie, an increase in serum creatinine) are observed in 0.9 to 2.4% of patients with MI, although some benefit from treatment with ACE inhibitors. Interestingly, administration of ACE inhibitors does not appear to further compromise severely impaired renal function and may also represent a useful tool for the treatment of patients with MI-associated renal dysfunction. The use of ACE inhibitors in MI patients is associated with a satisfactory clinical and laboratory safety profile. The occurrence of significant adverse events appears to be very low and is mainly attributable to a very modest prevalence of cough (2.4% to 6.8%). Discontinuation of therapy due to biochemical and haematological abnormalities has been observed in less than 1% of treated patients. Thus, the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitor therapy seem to outweigh safety concerns, thus reinforcing the role of ACE inhibition as a viable therapeutic strategy in the treatment of patients with MI.",0,0

This article is an interim report on 207 patients who participated in the study and were followed up for two months. At 1 month, lisinopril was discontinued more frequently in the ABP than in the CBP group (24 vs. 9 patients, p = 0.004). However, blood pressure control at two months was not significantly different in the two treatment groups. Baseline-adjusted differences in systolic pressure between the two treatment arms of the trial (ABP-CBP group), +2.7 mm Hg for conventional pressure (95% confidence interval [CI]): -2.9, +8.3), +0.4 mm for 24-hour pressure Night pressure of Hg (CI: -4.3, +5.1), -0.1 mm Hg (CI: -5.1, +4.8) for day pressure, and -0.7 mm Hg (CI: -6.7, +5.4) for day pressure. The corresponding differences in diastolic pressure were -1.3 mm Hg (CI: -4, +1.4), +0.1 mm Hg (CI: -3, +3.1), -1.1 mmgH (CI: -4.4, +2.1), and +0.3. mm Hg (CI: -3.7, +4.3), respectively. Therefore, the present findings do not refute the APTH research hypothesis. In terms of blood pressure control and the number of patients remaining on antihypertensive drugs, outpatient registry-based therapy may be preferable to conventional blood pressure measurement-guided therapy.",0,0
1954,8817407,Nifedipine and captopril exert differential effects on heart rate variability in patients with acute episodes of hypertension.,,"Wolk, R; Kulakowski, P; Ceremuzynski, L","Acute changes of heart rate variability (HRV) indicate changes in autonomic effects on the cardiovascular system and often precede ventricular arrhythmias. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of sublingual nifedipine 10 mg (n = 15) or captopril 25 mg (n = 13) on HRV in consecutive patients admitted to hospital with severe hypertension. HRV was calculated on-line from 300 cardiac cycles before and 60-90 minutes after drug administration. Initially, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was > 190 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was > 110 mm Hg. Both agents induced similar blood pressure reduction (BP). Nifedipine decreased the variance (-63 +/- 6%; P < 0.0001) and the high-frequency (HF) component (-72 +/- 8%; P < 0.0001) and both increased the LF/HF ratio (+870 +/) - 336%; P < 0.02) and heart rate (+14 +/- 3%; P < 0.0001). Captopril showed differential effects: variance and HF component increased by +176 +/- 55%; (P < 0.007) and +126 +/- 44% (P < 0.015), respectively. The LF/HF (low/high frequency) ratio decreased (-44 +/-19%; P < 0.04) with heart rate (-4 +/- 1%; < 0.009). It was concluded that, unlike nifedipine, captopril increased HRV and decreased the LF/HF ratio, making it a better choice in hypertensive patients who may be prone to dangerous arrhythmias.",0,0

The effect of enalapril initiated immediately after AMI on clinical and echocardiographic markers of left ventricular (LV) function was studied in a subset of CONSENSUS II patients; Heart failure symptoms and signs were classified as NYHA and dyspnea classes. Echocardiography included LV end-systolic volumes (ESV) and end-diastolic volumes (EDV), as well as ejection fraction (EF), wall motion index (WMI), and mitral flow indices. A total of 428 patients were included and followed for a mean of 5.1 months, with serial examinations beginning 2-5 days after myocardial infarction (MI) and repeated at 1 month and at study end; Enalapril had no beneficial effect on clinically determined function. Changes in functional status (ie, changes in NYHA class) throughout the study in patients in the placebo group remained correlated with changes in echocardiographic determinants: EDV index (r = 0.36, p = 0.002, ESV index (r = 0.49, p < 0.001)), EF (r = - 0.41, p < 0.001) and WMI (r = 0.29, p = 0.008) In the stepwise logistic regression model, the best baseline parameters for predicting NYHA class at the last visit in all patients were age (p = 0.014) and ESV index (p). = 0.001); Enalapril treatment for a mean period of 5.1 months post-MI resulted in no clinically significant beneficial effects on NYHA and dyspnea class echocardiographic markers in placebo-treated patients, but not in enalapril-treated patients.",1,0

Evaluation with spectral analysis and hemodynamic measurements.,,"Veerman, D P; Douma, C E; Jacobs, M C; Thien, T; Van Montfrans, G A","1. The effects of first dose and chronic treatment with spirapril, a novel angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on short-term blood pressure and heart rate fluctuations were evaluated by fast Fourier spectral analysis. Effects on systemic hemodynamics in the supine and standing positions were also studied. We treated 11 patients with spirapril 3 mg and 13 patients with 12 mg over 8 weeks. 2. Overall blood pressure variability was not altered by spirapril. With spectral analysis, changes in blood pressure and heart rate variability in various frequency bands can be evaluated, which may be associated with changes in autonomic nervous system activity. The relative strength in the mid-frequency band (0.08-0.12 Hz) of supine systolic pressure was 23 +/- 10% during placebo and decreased to 11% +/- 4% during treatment with 12 mg (P < 0.01, first dose versus placebo). ) and 13 +/- 6% (P < 0.01, chronic therapy). Standing systolic mid-frequency power was 38% +/- 12% during placebo and decreased to 27% +/- 9% (P < 0.01 vs placebo) after the first 12 mg dose, but not after chronic treatment (29 +/-%). 13). Treatment with 3 mg did not cause any change in medium frequency blood pressure variability. A decrease in the power of the mid-frequency band may indicate a decrease in sympathetic vascular drive. The power in the high frequency band of heart rate (0.15-0.40 Hz) did not change after treatment, suggesting no change in vagal cardiac drive. 3. Supine blood pressure decreased with 16% +/- 23% (3 mg) and 14% +/-19% (12 mg) reductions in vascular resistance after 8 weeks of treatment. Heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output did not change. Orthostatic hypotension did not occur after the first dose. In the 12 mg group, the orthostatically induced increase in heart rate (compared to supine) increased from +9 +/- 5 beats min-1 (placebo) to +14 +/- 4 beats min-1 (P < 0.05) after administration . first dose. There was no change in orthostatic heart rate increase in the 3 mg group. Orthostatic changes in stroke volume, cardiac output and vascular resistance were not affected by spirapril. 4. In conclusion, the decrease in mid-frequency blood pressure variability may suggest the inhibitory effect of acute and chronic ACE inhibition on sympathetic vasomotor control. Vagal activity was not affected as high-frequency heart rate variability did not change. Acute and chronic ACE inhibition did not blunt important cardiovascular reflexes, as the hemodynamic response to orthostasis remained intact.",0,0

These effects include electrolyte, glucose/insulin, lipid and uric acid disturbances. This may explain, at least in part, that early research examining the effect of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy with diuretics and beta-blockers showed beneficial effects on coronary artery disease that lagged disappointingly. Among the therapeutic drugs, diuretics cause disturbances in electrolyte homeostasis, for example hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hyponatremia. In contrast, ACE inhibitors cause hyperkalemia under certain conditions. Both diuretics and beta-blockers, particularly non-selective beta-blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic abilities, have been associated with disturbances in glucose/insulin metabolism and may cause deleterious changes in the profile of circulating plasma lipids. Hyperuricemia due to diuretic use appears to be a problem only in patients predisposed to high circulating uric acid levels.",0,0

This is true in terms of key modes of action in the patient, both at the cellular level and in the clinical setting. New pharmaceutical compounds such as renin inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and aldosterone antagonists are bringing new insights not only into the importance of different components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in heart failure, but also in the mode of action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. inhibitors. This manuscript also provides a brief update on the organization of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the organization of other angiotensin-II-generating pathways that are of particular relevance to heart failure. Data regarding the potential relevance of genetic polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are discussed. Probably the most important single observation in clinical cardiovascular medicine in 1995 was the report of a highly significant interaction between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and aspirin in patients with ventricular dysfunction with or without heart failure.

1962,8841011,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition after acute myocardial infarction, with special reference to the Fourth International Infarct Survival Study (ISIS-4).",,"Syed, M; Borzak, S; Jafri, S M","The role of ACE inhibitors in the management of asymptomatic or symptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is well established. More recently, large clinical trials have evaluated the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors immediately after AMI, that is, within 24 hours of symptom onset. This concept emerged with the understanding of the pathophysiological changes that occur after AMI. While neurohormonal activation and ventricular remodeling after AMI underlie these changes, the extent of LV dysfunction remains a strong predictor of poor outcome. Large clinical trials with a mortality endpoint have shown modest benefit with early use of ACE inhibitors in an unselected population. However, the generalized use of ACE inhibitors is controversial because of the little benefit overall. We review the pathophysiological changes that occur after AMI, the rationale for the early use of ACE inhibitors, and data from large clinical trials. We recommend that early ACE inhibitor be considered in all patients except the lowest risk patients. Clinical features of such a low-risk population include small non-anterior infarctions in patients younger than 65 years and patients with LV ejection fractions greater than 50%. Objective assessment of LV function at the time of hospitalization for AMI is warranted in order to appropriately select patients for ACE inhibitor therapy. To avoid hypotension, dosing should be started carefully and titrated to the dose target used in large studies. The duration of therapy should be indefinite in patients at high risk of death or ventricular enlargement. Further large-scale secondary prevention trials with long-term therapy are underway to evaluate the impact of ACE inhibition on coronary disease progression and re-infarction.",0,0

Thirty NIDD hypertensive patients (age = 50 +/- 3 years; BMI = 30 +/- 1 kg/m2) (mean +/- SEM) were studied before and after a 12-week period of antihypertensive therapy. Ten patients doxazosin (Cardura) (2-8 mg once daily or 8 mg twice daily), 9 patients captopril (Capoten) (25-50 mg twice) and 11 patients nifedipine (Procardia-XL) (30-60 mg) ) was treated with once a day). Blood pressure, creatinine clearance, 24-hour urinary protein excretion, fasting plasma glucose concentration, and glycosylated hemoglobin were measured before and after drug therapy. Fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were similar in all three groups before initiation of antihypertensive therapy and were not significantly changed from baseline in either treatment group. In the doxazosin group, creatinine clearance increased from 99 +/- 8 to 122 +/- 8 ml/1.73 m2.min (p < 0.01), while 24-hour urinary protein excretion decreased from 2.66 +/- 0.05 to 1.76 +/- . 0.02 mg/day/ml/1.73 m2.min (p < 0.01).

Medicines used by pregnant women are classified into 4 general categories: A to D. In 1979, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduced a system that uses the letters A to D along with the X category. However, definitions differ significantly between the FDA system and the Swedish system, resulting in very different allocation of drugs to the respective categories. In the Swedish system, category A includes drugs that are commonly used and/or for which there is reliable clinical data showing no evidence of impaired reproduction. Category B includes drugs for which data from pregnant women are insufficient to provide a robust estimate of human teratogenic risk, and therefore classification is based on animal data, divided into 3 subgroups. For Category C products, the pharmacological action of the drug may cause undesirable effects on the human fetus or newborn baby. Finally, category D includes drugs for which human data have shown an increased incidence of malformations. A short explanatory text is always followed by the categorization statement. Unlike the FDA system, the Swedish system was well accepted according to an interview study involving 934 physicians and pharmacists. We believe that much of the American dissatisfaction may be the result of deficiencies in the FDA system's category definitions. The FDA system requires data of unrealistically high quality, for example, for a drug to be assigned category A, controlled studies in pregnant women that do not show a risk to the fetus are required. As a result, most drugs in the US are market assigned category C, which is interpreted as 'risk cannot be excluded'. The distribution of drugs into the various categories is therefore very different between the Swedish and FDA systems. We think that the topic of this discussion reflects a fundamental problem with public health information: how to organize a large, composite, variable, and difficult-to-evaluate data bank before it is made available to professionals and secondarily to ordinary people.",0,0
1966,8857071,Lisinopril reduces post-exercise albuminuria more effectively than atenolol in primary hypertension.,,"Rangemark, C; Lind, H; Lindholm, L; Hedner, T; Samuelsson, O","Physical exercise causes transient albuminuria. The mechanisms of post-exercise albuminuria have not been fully elucidated, but stimulation of the reninangiotensin system (RAS) probably plays an important role through intrarenal hemodynamic changes that cause high filtration pressure. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we compared the effects of lisinopril (L) and atenolol (A) treatment on urinary albumin excretion (UAE), ie RAS inhibition or beta1-adrenoceptor inhibition we aimed to investigate? The mediated effects of the sympathetic nervous system differed according to the changes in BAE. Sixteen patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension were studied. Four standard cycling ergometer exercise tests were performed before and after each active treatment period. BAE as determined by radioimmunoassay was significantly reduced by both treatments after 30 min of exercise: -278 ug center point min-1 (L) and -199 ug center point min-1 (A). The post-exercise UAE reduction achieved with treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (L) was significantly greater than that achieved with beta1-selective adrenoceptor blocker therapy. Blood pressure (BP) at rest and during exercise was reduced equally by both drugs. In conclusion, this study showed that in patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension, antihypertensive treatment with an ACE inhibitor is more effective at reducing exercise-induced albuminuria than a beta1-selective adrenoceptor blocking agent with a similar degree of blood pressure reduction. This suggests that the RAS plays an important role in post-exercise albuminuria in hypertensive subjects. However, the clinical significance of this finding has not been clarified.",0,0

Hemodynamic studies, including exercise tests, were performed on the first and last days of treatment, before and 3 hours after the drug. Measurements were made at rest and at maximum exercise level. In ACEI-naïve patients, oral CLZ 0.5 and 1 mg/day resulted in a dose-related reduction in PCWP and diastolic PAP and a significant reduction in SVR mg. A slight increase in CI was observed in all groups. The maximum effect was observed 3-5 hours after the dose. After 12 weeks of oral therapy, the acute response was similar but attenuated relative to the first dose. Exercise tolerance improved in a dose-dependent manner. The NYHA classification remained unchanged or improved in the majority of patients. Entry to the 2.5 mg group had to be discontinued at an early stage due to serious adverse events observed after the first dose.; During chronic therapy, the hemodynamic response to oral cilazapril was attenuated, indicating that the sustained clinical improvement in CHF patients on the CLZ is independent of acute hemodynamic effects.",0,0

We wanted to confirm the differential responses to the first dose of these agents, to examine the response to repeated doses, and to explore possible explanations for the phenomenon (slow, tight binding and steric hindrance). 48 elderly patients (51-85 years) with stable CHF were studied over 48 hours. Groups (n = 12) received one of the following: (a) perindopril 2 mg orally (po) + placebo intravenously (iv) (day 1) and perindopril 2 mg po (day 2); (b) enalapril 2.5 mg po + placebo iv (day 1) and enalapril 2.5 mg po (day 2); (c) placebo po + perindopril 0.167 mg iv (day 1) and perindopril 2 mg po (day 2); or (d) placebo po + placebo iv (day 1) and placebo po (day 2). Supine BP was measured on day 1. On day 2, BP was recorded with an ambulatory BP monitor. For the estimation of neurohumoral parameters, blood samples were taken at baseline and at intervals throughout the 48-hour study period. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was predicted by plasma ACE inhibition as well as angiotensin II (Ang II)/Ang I + Ang II ratio. On day I, 2.5 mg of enalapril caused a greater reduction in blood pressure than the placebo response 6 to 9 hours after dosing. Perindopril 2 mg produced a BP response profile similar to placebo. At day 2, ambulatory blood pressure was consistently lower with enalapril compared to perindopril. Plasma ACE inhibition profiles were similar with each active therapy. Enalapril treatment produced a greater increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) than other treatments.

Cardiotropic effects have been associated with the drug, and the compensatory dual elimination pathway of fosinopril via the renal and hepatic systems offers an opportunity for ACE inhibitor therapy of hypertension in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Comparative trials of monotherapy with fosinopril 10 to 40 mg/day demonstrated antihypertensive efficacy equivalent to sustained-release nifedipine 40 mg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 to 50 mg/day, enalapril 5 to 10 mg/day amlodipine 5 to 10 mg/day. and sustained-release verapamil 240 to 480 mg/day and superior to 5 mg/day isradipine.

The combination fosinopril/chlortalidone 20 to 40/25 mg/day was as effective as propranolol/chlortalidone 80 to 160/25 mg/day. The incidence of side effects associated with fosinopril is low and cough is likely to occur less frequently with this drug compared to other ACE inhibitors.

Incidence, mechanisms and management.",,"Overlack, A","The most common side effect of ACE inhibitors is a dry, tickling and often bothersome cough. Recent studies show that approximately 10% of patients treated with ACE inhibitors may develop cough. ACE inhibitors should be discontinued in half of these patients. Cough arose as a class effect occurring with all ACE inhibitors with no clear difference between single agents. Although ACE inhibition is safe in the vast majority of patients with obstructive airway disease, increased bronchial reactivity has occasionally been reported as well as asthma symptoms or asthma exacerbation. ACE inhibition increases the cough reflex. The mechanisms underlying ACE inhibitor-induced cough are likely related to suppression of kininase II activity, followed by accumulation of kinins, substance P, and prostaglandins. Physicians should be aware that a dry cough is the most common side effect of ACE inhibitors and that this symptom may appear not soon after the start of treatment, but months or even a year later. Changing to another ACE inhibitor should not be attempted because coughing will almost always recur when re-administered with the same or another ACE inhibitor. The cough usually resolves within a few days after discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor, which is the treatment of choice.",0,0

With the exception of beta-blockers, very little has been studied in formal epidemiological designs. I present a new approach to such analysis that effectively controls confounders that are stable over time. I analyzed the exposure histories of 11,244 case antidepressant users using the Odense University PharmacoEpidemiological Database. All subjects starting both beta-blockers and antidepressants within a predefined period were identified. If beta-blockers do not cause depression, this particular population should show an equal number of people starting both drugs first. A depression-inducing effect of beta-blockers will create redundancy in people starting beta-blockers first, an unsymmetrical distribution of prescription orders. Confounders that cause the two drugs to be prescribed together are rarely expected to affect symmetry. The initial scan showed unsymmetrical prescription orders for a wide variety of cardiovascular drugs.

With the addition of thiol derivatives, 7 of 9 patients experienced 24 stone events, all 6 treated with hydration, alkalization and captopril experienced 10 events, and 4 of 5 patients treated with alkalization, thiols and captopril experienced 8 events (0.52 per patient). , 0.71 and 0.54 events) -years, respectively). During a total treatment period of 104.1 patient-years, 88 stone events occurred in 14 of 16 patients (0.84 events per patient-year); D-penicillamine and alpha-mercaptopropionylglycine are effective in reducing the rate of stone formation in patients in whom hydration and alkalization have failed. While captopril may be beneficial in this situation as well, it does not appear to be as effective as D-penicillamine or alpha-mercaptopropionylglycine and does not clearly confer clinical benefit to these thiols. Our study shows that patients with cystinuria are at high risk for relapse when treated with any contemporary medical program. This natural course should be taken into account when evaluating the long-term efficacy of newer or alternative medical and urological treatment modalities.",0,0

Therefore, patients randomized to receive low doses of enalapril had no change in treatment from baseline to 48 weeks. Forty-three patients (52%) completed the study, 19 patients on low dose and 24 patients on high dose. Both dosages equally affected survival with 15 (18%) deaths, eight at the low dose and seven at the high dose. After 48 weeks, functional capacity by New York Heart Association class improved more at high dose than low dose (P = 0.04). In contrast, changes in invasive hemodynamic variables at rest and exercise, as well as maximal exercise capacity, were comparable in both groups. Diastolic blood pressure decreased and the change between both groups was statistically significant (P = 0.01). Changes in plasma creatinine levels did not differ between high and low dose therapy, and no patients required discontinuation due to impaired renal function. Concerning neurohumoral activity, a differential trend was observed with both treatments, with a blunted increase in low-dose enalapril versus high-dose noradrenaline. Thus, despite similar effects on hemodynamics and maximal exercise capacity, high-dose enalapril therapy has proven to be superior to low-dose therapy in terms of symptomatology in severe heart failure after long-term therapy.",0,0

In 15 renal transplant patients immunocompromised with AZA and prednisone, ACEI was replaced with nifedipine or clonidine (14 enalapril and 1 captopril). Before and 10 to 12 weeks after ACEI discontinuation, AZA metabolites, renal function parameters, and haematological parameters including erythropoietin and reticulocytes were evaluated. Enalaprilat levels were measured and compared with 15 similar patients matched for transplant function and dose of cyclosporine and prednisone immunosuppressed enalapril. AZA metabolites did not differ significantly in the presence or absence of ACEI. Enalaprilat levels also did not differ significantly between the two patient groups treated with AZA or cyclosporine.

In conclusion, ACEI-related anemia in kidney transplant recipients appears to be due to the erythropoietin-lowering effect of this group of drugs. A pharmacokinetic interaction between AZA and enalapril is unlikely because plasma enalaprilat levels are independent of the immunosuppressive regimen and AZA metabolite levels were not altered in the presence and absence of ACEI.

Resting plasma PF4 decreased from 3.28 to 2.56 ng/mL during HCT2 treatment, although not significantly. During treatment with Spirapril, there were no changes in the adrenaline or ADP threshold for aggregation of platelets sampled at rest, and PF4 plasma levels did not show a significant reduction at rest. However, during exercise, PF4 has shown to approximately double the resting value independent of therapy. This exercise-induced increase in PF4 was significantly reduced by spirapril compared to placebo (P < 0.05). ECLT and t-PA were not significantly changed from the placebo level during either treatment. PAI-1 did not change during treatment with spirapril, but decreased from 15.91 with placebo (NS) to 9.36 IU/mL, although not significantly, during treatment with HCT2. Spirapril and HCT2 did not produce any undesirable side effects on platelet function or fibrinolysis.

The trial included patients whose sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) measurements were between 95 and 114 mm Hg (inclusive) at placebo baseline. Patients were randomized to receive losartan or amlodipine in a double masked, double dummy manner. A 4-week placebo washout period was followed by a 12-week active treatment period. Patients in the losartan arm (n = 97) received losartan 50 mg orally (PO) once daily at baseline (QD); The drug may be titrated to 50 mg losartan/12.5 mg HCTZ PO QD after 4 weeks, followed by 8 weeks if needed to 50 mg losartan plus 25 mg HCTZ PO QD after 8 weeks. Patients in the amlodipine group (n = 93) received amlodipine PO QD 5 mg titrated to 10 mg PO QD 4 weeks later followed by 10 mg plus 25 mg HCTZ PO QD 8 weeks later. The drug was titrated up as necessary to achieve SiDBP < 90 mm Hg. Efficacy, tolerability, and quality of life scores were evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment with each regimen. SiDBP reductions were clinically comparable after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment (losartan group: 7.3, 10.4, and 11.1 mm Hg, respectively; amlodipine group: 7.9, 11.2, and 11.8 mm Hg, respectively). Similar reductions in systolic blood pressure were seen for both treatment groups. The percentage of patients achieving target SiDBP (defined as SiDBP < 90 mm Hg or SiDBP > or = 90 mm Hg, with > or = 10 mm Hg reduction from the onset of placebo) was comparable for the two groups; 68% of the patients in the losartan group and 71% of the patients in the amlodipine group achieved the target. Significantly more patients in the amlodipine group experienced drug-related adverse experiences (27% vs 13%). In particular, drug-induced edema was more common in patients receiving the amlodipine regimen than those receiving the losartan regimen (11% vs. 1%). Although overall quality of life was not different in the two treatment groups, patients in the amlodipine arm reported significantly more discomfort due to edema (12% vs. 2%) compared to patients in the losartan arm, regardless of baseline edema. This study demonstrates that a losartan regimen with added HCTZ as needed provides comparable efficacy and superior tolerability and less discomfort for patients in terms of edema, compared to an amlodipine regimen with added HCTZ as needed.",0,0

This was probably because furosemide was given during meals. There were small but statistically significant differences in one of the pharmacokinetic parameters of furosemide and nifedipine (no difference for captopril and atenolol) when these drugs were given alone and in combination with orlistat: furosemide had a slightly longer half-life, with a slightly longer time to peak nifedipine plasma concentrations.

Effect of ACE inhibition on Diabetic Nephropathy showed that captopril reduced the rate of renal failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality in patients with IDDM and nephropathy. The aim of this study was to determine the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness of captopril as a treatment for patients with IDDM, as well as potential savings for all patients with diabetes and nephropathy. We used the results of a randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing captopril (207 patients) with placebo (202 patients), the aim of which was to determine whether it has renal-protective properties independent of its effect on blood pressure in diabetic nephropathy. A model of medical treatment for patients prior to progression to ESRD. We used data from the US Renal Data System and published literature to model the disease course after progression to ESRD and extend the model to patients with NIDDM. Medical resource cost data relied heavily on Medicare reimbursement levels, published wholesale drug prices, and surveys of healthcare providers. The economic model uses a payer perspective to estimate direct cost. The cost to society (indirect cost) associated with loss of patient productivity due to ESRD has also been estimated. Using this information, we estimated annual and lifetime costs if patients with IDDM and NIDDM and overt nephropathy were treated with placebo or captopril. We also constructed a model of the overall prevalence of diabetic nephropathy to estimate total savings in total US healthcare spending; Treatment with captopril resulted in absolute direct cost savings, or $32,550, per patient with IDDM for life compared to treatment with placebo. For patients with NIDDM, direct cost savings per patient totaled $9,900. Absolute savings were also found for indirect costs: $84,390 per patient with IDDM and $45,730 per patient with NIDDM. If captopril therapy had been introduced in 1995 for patients with IDDM or NIDDM and nephropathy, total healthcare cost savings (ie, direct cost savings only) would have been $189 million per year for 1999 and $475 million per year in 2004.

Losartan, the first of a new class of agents, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, can be administered as monotherapy in the treatment of hypertension or to complement existing therapy. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists block the effects of angiotensin II through preferential binding to the angiotensin II receptor subtype AT1 on the cell membrane.

Serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, potassium, plasma renin activity and N-terminal proatrial natriuretic factor (pro-ANF) as well as urinary aldosterone levels were measured periodically. Measurements at week 12 versus baseline showed significant increases in plasma renin activity and aldosterone excretion, and significant decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pro-ANF. Hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.4 mmol/L) occurred in 10% of the placebo-treated patients and 0.5% of the spironolactone group.

2003,8891468,Lisinopril. A review of its pharmacology and clinical efficacy in the early treatment of acute myocardial infarction.,,"Goa, K L; Balfour, J A; Zuanetti, G","After its efficacy in hypertension and congestive heart failure, the ACE inhibitor lisinopril has now been shown to reduce mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with myocardial infarction when administered as early therapy. The ability of lisinopril to attenuate the deleterious effects of left ventricular remodeling is a key mechanism; however, additional cardioprotective and vasculoprotective actions are hypothesized to play a role in mediating early benefit. The GISSI-3 study in over 19,000 patients demonstrated that lisinopril (with or without nitrates) provided measurable survival benefits within 1 to 2 days of starting treatment when given orally within 24 hours of symptom onset and continued for 6 weeks. Compared with no lisinopril treatment, there was an 11% reduction in risk of death and a 7.7% reduction in the combined endpoint (death plus severe left ventricular dysfunction) at 6 weeks. The benefits were evident in all types of patients. Thus, high-risk women, the elderly, patients with diabetes mellitus, and those with anterior infarction and/or Killip class > 1 also benefited. These gains in combined endpoint events were sustained over the longer term, despite discontinuation of treatment after 6 weeks in most patients. At 6 months, the incidence rate for the composite endpoint remained lower than for the control (a 6.2% reduction). The GISSI-3 results are in line with those from recent large studies of other ACE inhibitors (ISIS-4, CCS-1, SMILE) as early therapy in myocardial infarction. However, the results of the CONSENSUS II study (using intravenous enalaprilat followed by oral enalapril) were unfavorable in some patients. These findings, together with the development of persistent hypotension and, to a lesser extent, renal dysfunction in patients in the GISSI-3 trial, have led to substantial debate over optimal treatment strategies. The current view generally agrees that treatment with lisinopril or other ACE inhibitors shown to be beneficial can be initiated within 24 hours in hemodynamically stable patients with no other contraindications; Current labeling in the US and other countries reflects this position. It is almost unanimous that such therapy is indicated for high-risk patients, particularly those with left ventricular dysfunction. The choice of ACE inhibitor appears to be less important than the treatment decision; these benefits seem likely to be a class effect. Lisinopril has a similar tolerability profile to other ACE inhibitors, can be given once daily, and may cost less than other members of its class. However, current cost analyzes are flawed, and this last point remains to be proven in formal cost-effectiveness analyses. In conclusion, early treatment (within 24 hours of symptom onset) with lisinopril for 6 weeks improves survival and reduces cardiovascular morbidity in patients with myocardial infarction, with continued benefit after drug discontinuation. Although patients with symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction are prime candidates for treatment, anyone who is hemodynamically stable with no other contraindications is also eligible for treatment. Therefore, lisinopril and other ACE inhibitors, which have been shown to be beneficial, should be considered as an integral part of the early treatment of myocardial infarction in suitable patients.",0,0

At baseline, the two groups were well matched, including age (mean, 63 years), left ventricular ejection fraction (0.23), and peak oxygen consumption (15.4 mL/min/kg). After 3 months, four patients discontinued due to progressive heart failure (ibopamine, n = 1; placebo, n = 3; not significant) and two due to adverse events (n = 1/1).

This approach does not necessarily detect rare adverse events that can only be observed when large numbers of patients are studied. In conclusion, we designed a 12-week double-blind trial comparing the novel angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril (n = 5.053) with a well-known beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, metoprolol (n = 506). Mainly hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure 95-114 mm Hg) received quinapril 10 mg or 50 mg metoprolol once daily, and doses were doubled at 4-week intervals to a maximum of 40 and 200 mg, respectively, in non-responders. Responder rates were similar in both regimens. Adverse events were assessed by interview as well as a standard questionnaire. The overall prevalence of adverse events reported by the standard questionnaire was higher than self-reported during the interviews. Regarding typical ACE inhibitor adverse reactions (eg, cough and taste disturbances), there was no difference between quinapril and metoprolol, regardless of reporting style. In summary, both drugs showed comparable overall tolerance and safety. The discrepancy between spontaneously reported and survey-reported adverse events was striking, and this finding was valid in a volunteer group of 327 patients treated with quinapril for 52 weeks. Therefore, a questionnaire in addition to patient history/interview is of great importance in a large-scale, double-blind study designed to learn the details of drug safety.",0,0

To investigate the relationship between this interlead variation (QT dispersion) and left ventricular hypertrophy, we subjected 100 untreated subjects to 12-lead electrocardiography and echocardiography. In addition, 24 previously untreated subjects underwent a 6-month treatment study with ramipril and felodipine. In the cross-sectional portion of the study, the QT distribution corrected for heart rate (QTc distribution), left ventricular mass index (r = .30, P < .01), systolic pressure (r = .30, P < .01), peak flow of the early filling wave ratio of atrial wave to peak flow velocity (E/A ratio) (r = -.22, P = .02), isovolumic relaxation time (r = .31 , P < .01), and age (r = .21, P < .01) .04). In the treatment portion of the study, lead-modulated QTc dispersion decreased from 24 msec to 19 msec post treatment and remained at 19 msec after 2 weeks of drug washout (P < .01). Changes in left ventricular mass index at these stages were 144, 121, and 124 g/m2 (P < .01). Systolic pressure dropped from 175 to 144 mm Hg and rose again to 164 mm Hg (P < .01) after drug washout.

As a result, QT dispersion increases in hypertensive individuals in relation to increased left ventricular mass index. Antihypertensive treatment with ramipril and felodipine decreased both parameters. If an increased QT dispersion is an indicator of sudden death in this group of individuals, then the significance of its reduction is clear.",0,0

The aim of this study was to compare changes in arterial pressure with changes in components of the renin-angiotensin system in hypertensives following discontinuation of long-term ramipril therapy. Twenty hypertensives treated with ramipril for at least three months, in monotherapy for the last three weeks, were randomly assigned to two parallel groups and, on a double bond basis, for fifteen days, either placebo (withdrawal group W, n = 12) or previous doses of ramipril (treatment group T, n = 8). Blood pressure was measured using four different techniques. Active renin (AR), angiotensinogen, angiotensin I (ang I), angiotensin II (ang II) and aldosterone plasma concentrations, plasma angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) activity were measured in vitro (colorimetric and fluorimetric method) and in vitro. vivo (ang II/ang I ratio). The biological effects of discontinuing long-term ramipril therapy in hypertensives were decreased AR and angiotensin I concentrations, increased ACE activity, and no significant changes in angiotensinogen, angiotensin II, and aldosterone levels. Fifteen days after withdrawal, different parameters of the renin-angiotensin system appear to have returned to baseline. A slow increase in blood pressure was also observed, but no rebound increase in either angiotensin II levels or blood pressure was noted over the 15 days.

Three treatments over 8 weeks. The main evaluation criteria were diastolic blood pressure and serum potassium concentration. Equivalence was assessed on an intent-to-treat basis using Schuirmann's method, which involved performing two one-tailed statistical tests on the data. Thirty-five patients were withdrawn from the study, but there was no difference between the groups in terms of reasons for separation. Diastolic blood pressure decreased between 13.1 and 14.2 mmHg in the three groups.

PROGRESS Management Committee [fixed].,,"Neal, B; MacMahon, S","Patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease are at very high risk of stroke, and usual levels of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure are directly and consistently associated with this risk. Trials of blood pressure reduction in patients with transient ischemic attacks or stroke have been too small to reliably detect the effects of the modest blood pressure reductions achieved on stroke risk; The primary goal of PROGRESS is to pinpoint the effects of lowering blood pressure with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-based regimen on stroke risk in patients with a history of transient ischemic attack or minor stroke. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Prior to randomisation, there is a 4-week run-in phase in open-label ACE inhibitor therapy. The planned treatment and follow-up period is 4-5 years; The study will be conducted at partner clinical centers in Australia, Belgium, People's Republic of China, France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The study will include 6000 patients with a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) in the past 5 years. To be eligible patients, there should be no clear indications or contraindications for treatment with an ACE inhibitor and no barriers to regular attendance at study clinics; Study treatment would include perindopril and indapamide for patients without an indication or contraindication to treatment with a diuretic, perindopril alone, or matched placebo for all other patients, or matched placebos; The primary study outcome is total strokes, and secondary outcomes include fatal or disabling strokes, total major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular deaths, cognitive function and dementia, and disability and addiction.",1,0

The current study examines the hypothesis that CCBs sustaining reductions in proteinuria slow the progression of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)-related nephropathy to a comparable degree with ACE inhibitors, given similar levels of blood pressure control. To test this hypothesis, we recruited 52 patients with NIDDM-related nephropathy and hypertension, mean age 63 +/- 8 years, with the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril (N = 18), non-dihydropyridine CCBs (NDCCBs), verapamil SR (N = 8). 8) randomized. ) or diltiazem SR (N = 10), or the beta-blocker, atenolol (N = 16). Target blood pressure was < or = 140/90 mm Hg. The patients were followed up for an average of 63 +/- 7 months. The primary endpoint was the change in creatinine clearance (CCr) slope in each group. There was no significant difference in mean arterial pressure drop between groups over the study period (P = 0.14). The mean rate of decrease in CCr was highest in the atenolol group (-3.48 ml/min/year/1.73 m2; P < 0.0001). There was no difference in CCr slopes between the lisinopril and NDCCBs groups (P = 0.36). Proteinuria was reduced to a similar extent in the lisinopril and NDCCB groups (P > 0.99). Thus, in people with NIDDM-induced kidney failure, similar levels of blood pressure control with lisinopril or NDCCBs slowed the progression of kidney disease more than atenolol. In addition, this increased slowing of kidney disease progression correlated with sustained and significant reductions in proteinuria, findings not observed in the atenolol group.",0,0

A total of 409 insulin-dependent diabetic patients with established nephropathy participated in a study of the effect of captopril on the rate of progression of kidney disease. Baseline demographic, clinical (historical and physical), and laboratory parameters were analyzed as risk factors for time to progression. Binary properties were compared with Fisher's exact test and continuous characteristics with Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Univariate proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of nephropathy progression and bivariate proportional hazard regression to identify interactions with treatment group assignment. Multivariate proportional hazard regression was used to determine which traits were independent risk factors. We found that a number of demographic and clinical features were significantly associated with nephropathy progression even after adjusting for the treatment group. However, after multivariate analysis, risk factors that independently predicted progression were onset of IDDM later in life, parental diagnosis of IDDM, presence of edema, increased mean arterial pressure, and an abnormal electrocardiogram. Similarly, a number of laboratory features predicted nephropathy progression. A low hematocrit, high blood glucose, and higher protein excretion predicted nephropathy progression, as did a higher serum creatinine, particularly versus a normal serum albumin. In conclusion, this study identifies a set of clinical and laboratory risk factors that may predict which patients with insulin-dependent diabetes with established nephropathy are more likely to maintain a clinically significant reduction in kidney function at a median three-year follow-up.",0,0

ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce left ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction. In the GISSI-3 trial, patients were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of treatment with lisinopril, nitroglycerin in an open, 2 x 2 factorial design within 24 hours of the onset of myocardial infarction symptoms. The study showed that early treatment with lisinopril in relatively unselected patients reduced mortality and severe left ventricular dysfunction at 6 weeks. We evaluated (1) the prognostic value of pre-discharge 2-dimensional echocardiographic variables and (2) the effects of lisinopril on the progression of left ventricular dilatation; Pre-discharge 2-dimensional echocardiograms were available in 8619 GISSI-3 trial patients who were discharged alive. 6405 of these patients also had 2D echocardiographic studies at 6 weeks and 6 months. End-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and ejection fraction before discharge predicted 6-month mortality and non-fatal clinical congestive heart failure (P < 0.01). The increase in left ventricular volumes over time was significantly reduced by 6 weeks of lisinopril treatment in patients with > or = 27% pre-discharge. Dilatation was not seen in patients with wall motion asynergia <27%, and lisinopril did not affect volumes at 6 months. Patients randomized to lisinopril also had smaller volumes after discontinuation of treatment at 6 weeks.

In addition, activation of the renin-angiotensin system is frequently observed in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Theoretically, administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may increase sodium and water retention in cirrhotic patients with ascites. In this study, we evaluated the role of low-dose captopril on renal function changes, renal plasma flow and hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Fifty patients were randomly assigned to receive either captopril or placebo for 14 days. Renal function, renal plasma flow, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone concentration, and systemic and hepatic hemodynamics are measured before and after treatment. Our results show that placebo administration did not affect any of the parameters measured in this study. The finding that low-dose captopril significantly increased plasma renin activity suggests that the dose used in this study effectively blocked enzyme activity. However, low-dose captopril does not affect renal plasma flow, renal function, and systemic and hepatic hemodynamics. The results in this study suggest that inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme alone may not improve sodium and water retention in cirrhotic patients with ascites.",0,0

Twenty-four untreated patients (mean age, 46.4+/- 8.9 years) with diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 114 mm Hg and normal kidney function randomly received amlodipine or fosinopril and if diastolic blood pressure did not return to normal, doxazosin was added to therapy. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and 24-hour urine collection for albumin and transferrin measurements were performed before and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Diastolic blood pressure returned to normal in 23 patients (96%). Before treatment, 50% of patients had microalbuminuria. In the amlodipine and fosinopril group, antihypertensive treatment significantly reduced blood pressure and albuminuria in the fosinopril-only group. Transferrinuria did not change significantly in either group. While fosinopril reduced albuminuria in all patients, amlodipine reduced it in only half of the patients. Albuminuria, but not transferrinuria, was significantly correlated with ambulatory blood pressure. This correlation was more pronounced for systolic pressure than for diastolic pressure. A high prevalence of microalbuminuria may be observed in essential hypertensive patients with normal renal function. Albuminuria appears to be associated with ambulatory blood pressure, particularly systolic pressure. Intrarenal hemodynamic changes seem to play a more important role in the reduction of albuminuria than systemic blood pressure reduction. Transferrinuria does not appear to be a useful marker for monitoring nondiabetic hypertensive patients with early signs of glomerular dysfunction.",0,0

Lowering blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension requires increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system. Losartan, the first orally active, non-peptide angiotensin antagonist, competes specifically with angiotensin II (Ang II) for the AT1 receptor and reversibly modifies the receptor. Maximum blood pressure reduction occurs after doses of approximately 50 mg, although some patients may require 100 mg; The parent compound and a metabolite are responsible for a smooth 24-hour effect on blood pressure. It has been documented that once-daily dosing with losartan is safe.

Overall, no hypertensive patients withdrew from treatment due to elevated serum creatinine or potassium levels and there were no reports of angioedema. In addition, some reductions in plasma uric acid levels have been noted.

Regarding non-thiol drugs, the pathomechanism of acantholysis is still not elucidated; To elucidate the molecular mechanism of enalapril-induced acantholysis, a potential link between transglutaminase (TGase) activity and the effects of this drug was investigated; TGase activity in extracts from human breast skin cultured in the presence of thiopronin, captopril and enalapril was evaluated in vitro. The acantholytic potential of cystamine, a known TGase inhibitor, was also investigated; Enalapril, the most potent acantholytic drug in vitro, was found to inhibit both the purified enzyme and TGase activity in extracts from cultured human breast skin explants. Kinetic studies showed that the inhibition of enalapril was competitive with respect to the amino acceptor substrate and non-competitive with respect to the amino donor substrate. In addition, an acantholytic effect of cystamine on explants of normal human skin has been demonstrated; These results suggest that acantholysis and inhibition of TGase activity may be two related phenomena.",0,0
2031,8948517,Benefits of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists in slowing progressive renal failure: focus on fixed-dose combination antihypertensive therapy.,,"Epstein, M","Over the past two decades, major research has focused on the markers of chronic kidney disease and interventions against end-stage kidney disease to delay the relentless progression. Recent studies have provided a theoretical framework for predicting that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and possibly calcium antagonists may preferentially delay the progression of kidney disease. While most current clinical trials have evaluated the effects of ACE inhibitors in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), there are relatively few long-term studies evaluating the renal protective effects of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists. non-diabetic kidney disease. Although clinical trials have been initiated using both of these drug classes as monotherapy, theoretical considerations suggest that fixed-dose combinations of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist may be attractive as renal protective agents. Several lines of evidence suggest that the renal microcirculation effects of co-administration of both agents should be complementary. Similarly, recent observations suggest that the two classes may act in a complementary manner to balance pathogenetic mechanisms at the mesangium level. A recent study in type II diabetic patients showed that combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist induced the greatest reduction in proteinuria and reduced the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) more than either agent did alone at the same level. lowering of blood pressure. Based on such considerations, randomized prospective studies have recently been initiated to compare the renal protective effects of combination calcium antagonist-ACE inhibitor therapy with agents of either of these two antihypertensive classes versus monotherapy.",0,0
2032,8952600,Effect of angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene polymorphism on the effects of perindopril and nitrendipine on arterial stiffness in hypertensive subjects.,,"Benetos, A; Cambien, F; Gautier, S; Ricard, S; Safar, M; Laurent, S; Lacolley, P; Poirier, O; Topouchian, J; Asmar, R","Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors improve arterial stiffness independent of blood pressure reduction. Since we recently demonstrated that the A1166C polymorphism of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) is an independent predictor of aortic stiffness in hypertensive individuals, we designed this study to evaluate the effect of this polymorphism on changes in aortic stiffness. after chronic treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril and the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine. Forty hypertensive subjects treated with perindopril and 42 nitrendipine were studied. We assessed aortic stiffness by measuring the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Carriers of the AT1-RC allele showed higher baseline pulse wave velocity values than AA homozygotes (P < .05). A three-fold greater reduction in pulse wave velocity was observed in carriers of the C allele in the perindopril group compared to AA homozygotes (-2.85 +/- 0.62 vs -0.94 +/-0.32 m/s; P < .001) in the nitrendipine group. It was decreased only in AA homozygotes and not in AT1-RC carriers (-1.38 +/-0.35 vs +0.04 +/-0.60 m/s, respectively; P < .01). These results show that an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker affect pulse wave velocity in opposite ways, with respect to the AT1-R A1166C genotype. Because some evidence indicates that increased pulse wave rate may increase cardiovascular risk, it may be helpful for physicians to consider the AT1-R genotype when prescribing an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium channel blocker to a hypertensive individual.",0,0
2033,8957033,Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on renal tubular function in progressive chronic nephropathy.,,"Kamper, A L; Holstein-Rathlou, N H; Leyssac, P P; Strandgaard, S","The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on renal tubular function in progressive chronic nephropathy was investigated by lithium clearance (C(Li)) method in 69 patients. Repeated studies of up to 2 years were conducted during a controlled study of the effect of enalapril on the progression of renal failure. The proteinuria pattern was observed during the first 9 months. At baseline, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 5 to 68 mL/min. The absolute proximal tubular fluid reabsorption rate (APR), estimated as the difference between GFR and C(Li), was 1 to 54 mL/min. The calculated fractional proximal reabsorption (FPR) was moderately below normal. GFR decreased and sodium clearance remained unchanged during the study; therefore, the fractional sodium excretion is increased. In the group of patients randomized to treatment with enalapril (n = 34), 83% (P < 0.001) and C(Li) 88% (P < 0.01) of baseline GFR at 1 month were the APR and FPR were not significantly changed and potassium clearance was significantly reduced. For the remainder of the study period, APR remained virtually unchanged and even FPR increased in the enalapril group. In the group of patients randomized to treatment with conventional antihypertensive drugs (n = 35), C(Li), GFR, APR, and FPR remained unchanged until the drastic decrease gradually decreased, and potassium clearance was virtually unchanged. These differences in tubular function between the two treatment regimens were significant (P < 0.05). An unchanged or increased APR was associated with slower long-term progression of renal failure in both treatment regimens. During 9 months, the 24-hour fractional clearance of albumin decreased in the ACE inhibitor group (P < 0.01), while the clearance of immunoglobulin G and retinol-binding protein remained unchanged in this group. In the conventional group, the fractional clearances of all three plasma proteins were increased. It was concluded that ACE inhibitor therapy in progressive chronic nephropathy is associated with different adaptive tubular changes in sodium, water and protein utilization compared to conventional antihypertensive therapy. During ACE inhibition, it appeared that the reabsorption capacity of the proximal tubule was better preserved, which may be important for the beneficial effect of this therapy in chronic kidney disease.",0,0
2034,8957034,The effect of ramipril on blood pressure and protein excretion rate in normotensive non-diabetic patients with proteinuria.,,"Toto, R D; Adams-Huet, B; Fenves, A Z; Mitchell, H C; Mulcahy, W; Smith, R D","Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce proteinuria in both normotensive and hypertensive patients with proteinuric kidney disease. However, the mechanism of the antiproteinuric effect has not been clarified. To test the hypothesis that the antiproteinuric effect of ramipril is due to an improvement in glomerular permeability independent of blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate, we conducted a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover trial. The effect of low-dose (1.25 mg/day) and high-dose (5 mg/day) ramipril was evaluated in 15 normotensive non-diabetic patients with proteinuria (> 150 mg/day). The study was divided into four 12-week periods: placebo, high- or low-dose ramipril, switch to low or high-dose ramipril, and placebo. At the end of each period, blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow rate, urinary protein excretion rate, and plasma angiotensin II levels were measured. Mean arterial pressure, urinary protein/creatinine ratio, and albumin excretion rate were significantly reduced during low- and high-dose ramipril. Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow rate did not change significantly. Plasma angiotensin II levels were decreased with both low and high dose ramipril. There were no episodes of hypotension during ramipril and only one patient developed a cough that did not require discontinuation of study medication. In conclusion, administration of both low and high doses of ramipril reduced blood pressure and reduced proteinuria in a cohort of these normotensive patients with various proteinuric kidney diseases. The antiproteinuric effect of ramipril is likely mediated by a decrease in glomerular capillary pressure.",0,0

Therapeutic requirements to maintain tight blood pressure control.,,,"We report the efficacy of treatment at 5-year follow-up in 758 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients in a prospective, randomized controlled trial of the treatment of mild hypertension. Patients with systolic blood pressure above 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure above 85 mmHg receiving antihypertensive therapy, or with systolic blood pressure above 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg if not receiving treatment were included. Mean blood pressures at study entry were 160/94 mmHg at a mean age of 57 years. They were divided into tight control (targeting systolic < 150/diastolic < 85 mmHg) or less tight control (targeting systolic < 180/diastolic < 105 mmHg). The tight control group was allocated to primary treatment with either a beta-blocker (atenolol) or an antiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) with the addition of other agents as needed. Over 5 years, mean blood pressure was significantly lower in the tight control group (143/82 vs. 154/88 mmHg, p < 0.001). No differences were seen between those set aside for atenolol or captopril. In those given atenolol or captopril, the proportion of patients requiring three or more antihypertensive treatments to maintain tight control increased from 16% and 15%, respectively, at 2 years to 25% and 26%, respectively, at 5 years, while in the less stringent control group only at 2 and 5 years. 5% and 7% required three or more treatments, respectively. There was no difference in the incidence of adverse events or hypoglycaemic episodes between those given atenolol or captopril, but those given atenolol increased their body weight by an average of 2.3 kg, while those given captopril increased by 0.5 kg (p < 0.01). . The allocation of atenolol has also been associated with small increases in triglyceride and reductions in LDL and HDL cholesterol, which are clinically uncertain.

The secondary aim was to determine the equivalence of the effects of a calcium channel blocker (nisoldipine) and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) as first-line antihypertensive agents in the prevention and/or progression of these diabetic vascular complications. The study consisted of two study populations aged 40-74, 470 hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure > or = 90.0 mmHg at randomization) and 480 normotensive patients (diastolic blood pressure 80.0 mmHg at randomization). The period of operation is 5 years and is scheduled to end in May 1998. Patients were randomized to receive intensive antihypertensive drug therapy or moderate antihypertensive drug therapy. Patients are also randomized to nisoldipine or enalapril, and open-label drugs are added if further blood pressure control is required. The primary outcome measure is glomerular filtration rate as assessed by 24-hour creatinine clearance. Secondary outcome measures are urinary albumin excretion, left ventricular hypertrophy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality will also be evaluated. Given the data showing the impact of hypertension on complications in NIDDM, the ABCD Trial was designed to determine whether intensive antihypertensive therapy would be more effective than moderate antihypertensive therapy on the outcome of diabetic complications in NIDDM.",0,0

The study also examined the ability of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to distinguish pharmacodynamic patterns in patients with congestive heart failure, which is associated with reduced circadian variability in blood pressure and heart rate among hospitalized patients. Increased plasma norepinephrine, renin activity, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are positively correlated with worsening clinical status. ACE inhibitors have been found to be useful in the treatment of congestive heart failure. In 30 patients with congestive heart failure (classes II-IV, New York Heart Association), 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and neurohumoral measurements were recorded before treatment with lisinopril or captopril and repeated after 6 weeks of treatment. Fourier analysis was used as a curve smoothing technique to compare the pharmacodynamics of the two ACE inhibitors. The absolute amplitude of systolic blood pressure was inversely proportional to plasma norepinephrine and ANP (p = 0.004), but not to renin activity. Mean 24-hour systemic arterial blood pressure did not decrease significantly after treatment with ACE inhibitors. An increase in the absolute amplitude of systolic blood pressure is inversely proportional to the baseline amplitude (p < 0.00001). Examination of Fourier smoothed curves showed differences in the circadian effect of lisinopril and captopril on systolic blood pressure and velocity-pressure product. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can be useful in evaluating the severity and management of congestive heart failure.",0,0

Unlike captopril, it is a prodrug of the pharmacologically active agent moexiprilat and will be administered once daily. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of moexipril with captopril during 12 weeks of treatment in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Patients with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of 95-114 mm Hg (inclusive) were randomized 2:1 to receive moexipril 7.5 mg once daily or captopril 25 mg twice daily. After 6 weeks of treatment, if the patient's SDBP remained > or = 90 mm Hg, the dose of moexipril and captopril was increased to 15 mg once daily and 50 mg twice daily. Blood pressure was measured at biweekly visits. At the endpoint of the study, adjusted mean reductions in SDBP were comparable between the moexipril and captopril groups (-9.8 vs -8.7 mm Hg), and moexipril sitting was more effective than captopril in lowering systolic blood pressure. Adverse experiences (headache, dizziness, and upper respiratory tract infection) occurred with similar frequency in the moexipril and captopril groups.

Two study periods of 172 hours each were separated by a 2-week placebo period. Repeated measurements of the following parameters were made: brachial artery systolic blood pressure (SBP); diastolic blood pressure and mean blood pressure (using a mercury sphygmomanometer); carotid artery SBP and pulse pressure (by applanation tonometry); aortic stiffness (with pulse wave velocity); and the effect of arterial wave reflections in the common carotid artery (magnification index by applanation tonometry). A radioimmunoassay was used to determine plasma angiotensin II levels. Quinaprilat pharmacokinetics were studied using a specific assay. Two-way (time-treatment) analysis of variance was used for repeated measurements, analysis of covariance for two within-factors, and a covariate varying with the level of factor duration (pressures measured each time), and a second covariate for statistical analysis as baseline values of the parameter studied; Quinapril treatment caused a prolonged reduction in arterial wave reflections, which was still observable 172 hours after quinapril administration and was present after the effect of the blood pressure drop had been abolished. The effect on wave reflections was associated with a more pronounced and sustained reduction in carotid SBP and pulse pressure than brachial SBP and pulse pressure. Quinapril administration also caused a prolonged decrease in aortic pulse wave velocity, although this effect was entirely due to parallel changes in blood pressure. Arterial hemodynamic changes were not associated with plasma angiotensin II or kinaprilat levels; The results of this controlled study show that ACE inhibition in ESRD patients results in a prolonged, blood pressure-independent reduction in arterial wave reflections. The result of this was a reduction in pulsatile pressure load on the central arteries with increased aortic resilience. The increased aortic resilience resulted from a decrease in blood pressure. The observed arterial hemodynamic changes suggest that ACE inhibition causes changes in arterial wave reflections in distal parts of the arterial tree.",0,0

Patients were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive valsartan 80 mg once daily, enalapril 20 mg once daily, or placebo for 8 weeks in general practice. The patients were evaluated at the 4th and 8th weeks of the treatment.; The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) after 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary variables were change in sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP) and response rates at 8 weeks; Valsartan and enalapril produced statistically significant reductions in diastolic and systolic blood pressures compared to placebo. Similar decreases were found in both active treatment groups, with mean changes in SDBP of -9.5 mmHg for valsartan and -9.4 mmHg for enalapril (-4.5 mmHg for placebo) at 8 weeks. No significant difference was found between valsartan and enalapril for reductions in SDBP or SSBP. At 8 weeks, response rates were significantly higher for valsartan (54%) and enalapril (58%) than for placebo (20%), and there was no significant difference between the two active treatments. Both valsartan and enalapril demonstrated a consistent antihypertensive effect over time, with 90% of patients responding at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Both treatments were well tolerated. Although the incidence of cough was generally low in the study, more cases were reported with enalapril (three) than with valsartan (one) or placebo (none); Data show that valsartan 80 mg once daily is as effective as enalapril 20 mg once daily in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.

NSVT is associated with increased mortality in CHF. However, the predictive value of NSVT as a marker for sudden death or death from progressive heart failure has not been established.; Five hundred and sixteen patients (33.4% with NSVT) from the GESICA study were studied with initial 24-hour Holter and 2-year follow-up results. Within 2 years, 87 (50.3%) of 173 patients with NSVT and 106 (30.9%) of 343 patients without NSVT died. The relative risk (RR) was 1.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27 to 2.24; P < .0002) and the Cox proportional hazard analysis was 1.62 (95% CI, 1.22 to 2.16; P < .001).

2054,9000551,Renal failure due to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Textor, S C","The introduction of agents that block the renin-angiotensin system has greatly benefited patients with hypertension, kidney diseases, and congestive heart failure. Some of the therapeutic advantages for the kidney result from the removal of angiotensin II in the efferent arteriole. In some cases, especially when the afferent blood supply is compromised beyond renal arterial stenosis, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can lead to reductions in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and impaired potassium excretion that clinicians should be ready to determine. and manage. How often this occurs and when such a reduction poses a threat to renal parenchymal viability depends on the initial conditions of the renal vasculature and sodium balance. While these observations have primarily been made with ACE inhibitors, the basic principles apply to other agents that interact with components of the renin-angiotensin system, including angiotensin II antagonists and renin inhibitors. When identified and treated promptly, changes in kidney function under these conditions represent a modest and acceptable risk that is well worth taking in exchange for major therapeutic benefits.",0,0

After the placebo acclimatization period, 308 patients (all white) were randomized to treatment groups and received medication once daily for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was measured in the 23 to 26 hour period after dosing after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Patients wore noninvasive blood pressure monitors 24 hours before randomization and before the last visit. Investigators recorded adverse experiences at randomization and at study weeks 4 and 8, and obtained samples for laboratory testing at randomization and at study week 8. Three hundred and seven patients were evaluated for efficacy and 308 for tolerability and safety. At the endpoint (final postrandomization measure for each patient), the reduction in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure with amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg treatment was statistically significantly greater than for any comparative treatment.

Serum ACE activity is a weak index of neurohormonal suppression or hemodynamic effects after ACE inhibitor therapy. However, serum ACE activity can be a useful index of adherence to treatment, as serum ACE is sensitive to the presence of an ACE inhibitor in the blood. Sixteen normotensive male volunteers of known ACE genotype were treated with lisinopril 20 mg (L) or matched placebo (P) four times 2 weeks apart for 7 days for 7 days to simulate non-compliance (A) (all P), (B) took. ) complete compliance (all L), (C) partial compliance (L day, 1, 3, 6; P day, 2, 4, 5, 7) or (D) single dose (L day 7; P, 1-) 6). Supine (30 minutes) blood pressure (BP)/heart rate (HR), ACE and angiotensins were measured at d7 before dose and 4-6 hours after dose. Results average +/- 1 SD. BP showed the expected small reduction in d7 (B or D) with active treatment, but not with placebo (A) or partial compliance (C). Pre-study serum ACE was reproducible within subjects despite a wide range (16-124 U/L) [coefficient of variation (CV), 1.7%]. Serum ACE activity before (41.9 +/-30) and after (41 +/-30) angiotensin (A) I or II was not affected by treatment (placebo A). Active treatment (B) resulted in very low serum ACE activity and little suppression at d7 and after dosing (3.9 +/- 4; after, 1.8 +/- 4). A1 was elevated in this group with further elevation after dosing (first, 234 +/- 116; later, 551 +/- 250). AII decreased only modestly from baseline and showed little more suppression after dosing (first, 7.8 +/- 4; later, 6.3 +/-5). Partial compliance (C) showed low ACE but no reduction after treatment (before, 7 +/- 3; after, 7 +/- 4), high AI but no dosing effect (before, 187 +/- 198; after, 200 +/- 151) and decreased AII, but without further dose suppression (before, 6.4 +/- 3.4; after, 7 +/- 4) increased peptide (compared to B). Single dose treatment (D) showed ACE inhibition as expected (previously, 47 +/- 30; after, 2.2 +/- 3). There was a dosing-related increase in A1, but to a lesser extent (before, 39 +/- 10; after, 240 +/- 200) than seen with chronic active dosing (B).

2063,9010643,Risk-benefit assessment of losartan potassium in the treatment of hypertension.,,"Burrell, L M","Losartan potassium is the first of a new class of orally active antihypertensive drugs that antagonize the action of angiotensin (AT) II at the AT1 receptor subtype. Losartan potassium is converted by the liver to the active metabolite E-3174, which is a more potent antagonist at the AT1 receptor. E-3174 is responsible for most of the pharmacological effects of losartan potassium, and its long half-life contributes to the drug's prolonged duration of action. Losartan potassium is effective as a once-daily antihypertensive agent. In mild to moderate hypertension, losartan potassium has similar efficacy to enalapril, atenolol, and felodipine prolonged release. Further reductions in blood pressure occur when losartan is combined with potassium hydrochlorothiazide. Losartan potassium is well tolerated in mild, moderate, and severe essential hypertension, and dizziness is reported as the only drug-related adverse event. The overall rate of discontinuation (2.3%) of patients due to adverse experiences with losartan potassium was lower than for placebo (3.7%). First dose hypotension is uncommon, perhaps due to the slower onset of the drug's effect, and coughing does not appear to be a major problem. A number of areas regarding the safety and efficacy of losartan potassium remain to be clarified. In particular, long-term tolerability studies are needed; cough appeared as a side effect of ACE inhibitors only after 3 to 4 years of use. Post-marketing surveillance has shown that angioedema, a rare but life-threatening side effect of ACE inhibitors, also occurs with losartan potassium. More data are needed on the use of losartan potassium in patients with renal impairment before accepting the recommendation that no dose adjustment is necessary. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of losartan potassium in patients with liver disease also require further investigation. Losartan potassium increases uric acid secretion and lowers plasma uric acid levels; this may be beneficial when losartan potassium is combined with a thiazide diuretic, but may otherwise lead to uric acid stone formation and possibly nephropathy. Simple control of blood pressure is no longer an adequate goal in the treatment of hypertension. Any new antihypertensive agent should also reduce cardiovascular events, prevent or cause regression of end-organ damage such as left ventricular hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, and renal failure, and should not impair quality of life. Such data on losartan potassium are currently not available. Losartan potassium is likely to be used in patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors, but its future in the management of hypertension will depend on long-term tolerability studies and data on its effects beyond simple blood pressure control.",0,0

The relationship of ACE-Is and angioedema is not well recognized, in part because the onset of angioedema can be delayed months or years after the onset of an ACE-I. There is a risk of persistent angioedema in patients who start ACE-I initially uneventfully. The epidemiology of angioedema is changing in parallel with the increasing use of ACE-Is.",0,0
2069,9032106,Differences in glomerular filtration rates and albuminuria between nisoldipine and lisinopril in hypertensive IDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy in the first year of treatment.,,"Rossing, P; Tarnow, L; Boelskifte, S; Jensen, B R; Nielsen, F S; Parving, H H","Our aim was to compare the effect of a long-acting calcium antagonist (nisoldipine) versus an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) on albuminuria, arterial blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in hypertensive IDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy. We conducted a 1-year, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, controlled study comparing nisoldipine (20-40 mg once daily) to lisinopril (10-20 mg once daily) in 52 hypertensive IDDM subjects with diabetic nephropathy. Three patients were separated and the results of the remaining 49 patients (25 nisoldipine, 24 lisinopril) are presented. 10 nisoldipine and 8 lisinopril-treated patients required diuretics. Every 3 months, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (TM2420, A&D, Tokyo, Japan) and albuminuria were measured in three 24-hour samples (enzyme immunoassay); GFR (51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance) was recorded every 6 months. Mean arterial blood pressure (24 hours) was reduced from baseline (mean +/- SE) 108 +/- 3 mmHg to a mean of 101 +/- 2 and 105 +/- 2 to 103 during treatment in the lisinopril group. /- 2 in the nisoldipine group (P = 0.06, comparison of changes in the two groups). Albuminuria was decreased by 47% (95% CI 21-65) in the lisinopril group versus an 11% (-3 to 27) increase in the lisinopril group (P = 0.001). Fractional albumin clearance was decreased by 37% (95% CI 459%) in the lisinopril group, while there was an increase of 35% (8-69%) in the nisoldipine group (P < 0.01). GFR decreased from 85 +/- 5 ml x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2) to 73 +/- 5 in the lisinopril group and from 84 +/- 6 to 80 +/- 7 in the nisoldipine group (P < 0.05). The effect of study drug on albuminuria and GFR was independent of changes in systemic blood pressure and baseline variables in multiple regression analyses. In summary, lisinopril reduced albuminuria as well as GFR more than nisoldipine in hypertensive IDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy at 1 year of treatment. Longer follow-up is needed to clarify whether these drugs have differential renoprotective effects.",0,0

We investigated the potential mechanisms by following 41 patients with early heart failure for 1 year. These patients were randomized in a prospective triple-blind fashion to receive either enalapril or placebo. Repeated measurements of echocardiographic parameters, glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, hematocrit, plasma neurohormones, and QTc dispersion were taken over 1 year. Echocardiographic parameters improved with enalapril but worsened with placebo (cardiac output 4.6 +/- 1.6 to 3.7 +/- 1.5 L/min with placebo and 4.5 +/- 1.3 to 5 with enalapril .8 +/- 2.0 L/min; p < 0.01 ). In contrast, there was no significant change in renal blood flow (518 +/- 185 to 509 +/- 180 ml/min/1.73 m2 with placebo and 541 +/- 142 to 504 +/- 162 ml/min/1.73 m2 with enalapril. ). Glomerular filtration rate was changed from 79 +/- 20 to 78 +/- 19 ml/min/1.73 m2 with placebo and from 85 +/- 21 to 73 +/- 27 ml/min/1.73 m2 with enalapril ( p = 0.051 ). Enalapril lowered hematocrit (0.414 +/- 0.041 to 0.377 +/- 0.040%) significantly more than placebo (0.420 +/- 0.029 to 0.411 +/- 0.023 l/l; p < 0.01). In addition, enalapril produced a significant reduction in QTc distribution (93 +/- 36 to 88 +/- 28 ms with placebo and 93 +/- 35 to 60 +/- 22 ms with enalapril; p < 0.05). Thus, enalapril significantly reduced hematocrit and reduced QTc dispersion in early heart failure. Both of these effects, particularly the latter, may be an important mechanism for the reduction in mortality seen with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure. In contrast, renal hemodynamics did not correlate with placebo-induced deterioration in cardiac function or enalapril-induced improvement in cardiac function.",0,0
2071,9037321,Changes in insulin sensitivity during angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy are associated with changes in calcium/magnesium balance.,,"Haenni, A; Berglund, L; Reneland, R; Anderssson, P E; Lind, L; Lithell, H","This analysis was conducted to investigate the associations between changes in mineral factors, specifically the balance between serum calcium and magnesium concentrations (S-Ca and S-Mg, respectively) and variables reflecting glucose and lipid metabolism during angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). inhibitor therapy. A total of 96 patients with essential hypertension who participated in four double-blind studies with four different ACE inhibitors and similar protocols were included. At the end of the initial placebo period and at the end of the active drug treatment period, a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp test was performed, lipoprotein status was evaluated, and serum electrolyte concentrations were measured. Serum ACE activity was determined in the group treated with fosinopril. Changes in the insulin sensitivity index (M/I) were directly proportional to changes in S-Mg (r = 0.24, P < .02) and inversely to changes in S-Ca (r = -0.19, P = .07). and the ratio (Ca/Mg) between serum calcium and magnesium concentrations (r = -0.27, P < .008). The change in total serum triglycerides (S-Tg) was inversely related to the change in S-Mg (r = -0.35, P < .0005) and was directly related to the change in the Ca/Mg ratio (r = 0.36, P). < .0004). The decrease in serum ACE activity is associated with a more significant increase in S-Mg r = -0.62, P < .002 and a decrease in Ca/Mg ratio (r = 0.73, P = .0002). We conclude that changes in metabolic variables studied and serum ACE activity during ACE inhibitor therapy are related to changes in mineral status and the balance between serum calcium and magnesium concentrations.",0,0

In this double-blind mandatory titration study design, the effects of mibefradil 50, 100, and 150 mg and nifedipine GITS 30, 60, and 90 mg monotherapy or in combination with lisinopril 20 mg were evaluated in 71 moderate to severe hypertensive patients (59 men and 12 women) with confirmed outpatient hypertension. . An increased dose-response effect on both clinical and ambulatory blood pressure parameters was observed during treatment with mibefradil and nifedipine alone with GITS and in combination with lisinopril. At the maximum dose, patients treated with mibefradil experienced a greater reduction in clinical and ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (P < .05) and a higher response rate (86% versus 69%). The trough:peak ratios for systolic and diastolic blood pressures were >90% at each dose level. A significant reduction in heart rate from baseline was observed with mibefradil 150 mg alone or in combination with lisinopril, but no clinically significant atrioventricular conduction abnormalities were observed in any patient. Adverse events related to vasodilation were more common in the nifedipine GITS group. In conclusion, the results of this study show that the new calcium channel blocker mibefradil alone or in combination with lisinopril is effective in lowering clinical and 24-hour blood pressures while lowering heart rate and is well tolerated in moderate to severe patients. hypertension.",0,0

Indicators and thresholds were developed and approved by the Pharmacy and Treatment Committee. The medical charts of 227 patients prescribed lisinopril from June 1991 to June 1992 were reviewed for appropriateness of prescribing, appropriateness of monitoring, occurrence of any adverse drug reactions, and detection of drug interactions. Prescribing was appropriate and monitoring was appropriate in 97% of all cases studied. The most common adverse drug reactions detected were cough (7%), hypotension (3%) and rash (2%). Patients were also prescribed several drugs that could interact with lisinopril. Lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective. Forty patients (18%) experienced lisinopril-related adverse drug reactions. No major shortcomings were observed in lisinopril prescribing, and no corrective action was required for the appropriate use of lisinopril, other than educational activities. Information from this drug use assessment is useful in formulaic decision making.",0,0

Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) Treatment,,"Grimm, R H; Grandits, G A; Prineas, R J; McDonald, R H; Lewis, C E; Flack, J M; Yunis, C; Svendsen, K; Liebson, P R; Elmer, P J","Problems with sexual function have been a longstanding concern in the treatment of hypertension and may influence the choice of treatment regimens and decisions to discontinue medications. The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Trial (TOMHS) provides an excellent opportunity to examine the number of drug classes studied, the double-blind study design, sexual function and the effects of treatment on sexual function in men and women with stage I diastolic hypertension. and long-term follow-up. TOMHS was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 902 hypertensive individuals (557 men, 345 women) aged 45 to 69 years treated with placebo or one of five active drugs (acebutolol, amlodipine maleate, chlorthalidone, doxazosin maleate, or enalapril). maleate). All participants received intensive lifestyle counseling regarding weight loss, reduction of dietary sodium, reduction of alcohol (for current drinkers), and increased physical activity. Sexual function was determined by physician interviews at baseline and annually during follow-up. At baseline, 14.4% of men and 4.9% of women reported a problem with sexual function. In men, 12.2% had problems obtaining and/or maintaining an erection; 2.0% of women reported that they had orgasm problems. At baseline, erection problems in men were positively associated with age, systolic pressure, and previous use of antihypertensive medication. The incidence of erectile dysfunction in men at follow-up was 9.5% and 14.7% at 24 and 48 months, respectively, and was related to the type of antihypertensive therapy. Participants randomized to chlorthalidone reported a significantly higher incidence of erectile dysfunction than participants randomized to placebo for 24 months (17.1% versus 8.1%, P = .025). At 48 months, incidence rates were more similar between treatment groups than at 24 months, with nonsignificant differences between the chlorthalidone and placebo groups. The incidence was lowest in the doxazosin group but not significantly different from the placebo group. The incidence for the acebutolol, amlodipine and enalapril groups was similar to that in the placebo group. In most cases, erectile dysfunction does not require discontinuation of the drug. The disappearance of erection problems in men with problems at baseline was common in all groups, but was most common in the doxazosin group. The incidence of reported sexual problems in women was low in all treatment groups. In conclusion, the incidence of long-term erectile dysfunction in treated hypertensive men is relatively low, but higher with chlorthalidone therapy. The effects of erectile dysfunction with chlorthalidone occur relatively early and are generally tolerable, and new occurrences are unlikely after 2 years. The rate of sexual problems reported in hypertensive women is low and does not differ according to the type of drug. The similar incidence rates of erectile dysfunction in placebo and in most active drug groups warn against routinely attributing erectile dysfunction to antihypertensive drugs.",0,0
2075,9039154,Combined sympathetic suppression and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in congestive heart failure.,,"Manolis, A J; Olympios, C; Sifaki, M; Handanis, S; Cokkinos, D; Bresnahan, M; Gavras, I; Gavras, H","Neurohormonal activation is a pathogenic contributor and prognostic marker in congestive heart failure (CHF). While angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is currently the first-line therapy, sympathetic inhibition has only recently been proposed for this purpose. Recently, we reported improvement of preload parameters by sympathetic suppression with clonidine. In this paper, we reviewed 16 patients with Class III or IV CHF (13 men, 3 62 +/- 8 years old women, ejection fraction 33 +/- 8%). Hemodynamic and hormonal measurements were taken at baseline after diagnostic cardiac catheterization and again 2 hours after treatment. The results show that preloading parameters such as RAP, PCWP and MPAP are significantly reduced with combination treatment but not with captopril alone. In contrast, SVR was significantly reduced with both treatments and SVI was significantly increased with both - although the final change was significantly greater with the captopril/clonidine combination than with captopril alone. Suppression of plasma norepinephrine occurred with the combination only (clearly attributable to clonidine), whereas plasma renin activity was increased in both regimens, apparently due to captopril. Our results show that the combination of clonidine with captopril causes significant improvements in both preload and postload parameters of CHF and the correction of activated neurohormones, suggesting additional hemodynamic and hormonal benefits from these two treatment modalities.",0,0

Systolic Hypertension (SYST-EUR) Trial Researchers in Europe.,,"Staessen, J A; Thijs, L; Bijttebier, G; Clement, D; O'Brien, E T; Palatini, P; Rodicio, J L; Rosenfeld, J; Fagard, R","We investigated how interindividual variability, correction for placebo effects, and smoothing of blood pressure profiles in parallel group trials could be addressed in measuring trough-to-peak ratio in 244 individuals with isolated systolic hypertension (> or = 60 years). Placebo-controlled Trial of Systolic Hypertension in Europe. Net treatment effects were calculated by subtracting the mean changes from baseline during placebo (n = 133) from those during active treatment (n = 111). At baseline, systolic/diastolic pressures averaged 176/86 mm Hg at clinic and 149/80 mm Hg at 24-hour ambulatory follow-up. With adjustments for baseline and placebo, possible addition of enalapril (5 to 20 mg/day) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg/day), nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg/day), decreased (P < .001) this blood pressure values of 16.6/7.3 and 9.8/4.7 mm Hg, respectively. Net trough-to-peak ratios were first determined from blood pressure profiles (12 hours) with 1-hour precision synchronized with morning and evening doses of the double-blind drug. According to the customary approach, the systolic/diastolic net trough-peak ratios were 0.46/0.40 in the morning and 0.77/0.99 in the evening, ignoring inter-individual variability. In individual subjects, baseline-adjusted trough-to-peak ratios were abnormally distributed. Therefore, we used a nonparametric technique to calculate net trough-to-peak ratios from results in individual subjects. These ratios mean 0.25 systolic (95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.41) and 0.15 diastolic (95% confidence interval, 0.00 to 0.31) in the morning and 0.19 and 0.36 (95% confidence interval, 0.00 to 0.38 and 0.14 to 0.56) in the evening, respectively. . When blood pressure profiles were smoothed out by replacing moving or fixed 2-hour averages or 1-hour averages with Fourier modeling, the trough-to-peak ratios remained unchanged after the morning dose (0.20/0.13, 0.20/0.14 and 0.16/0.21), but the evening rises tended (0.32/0.38, 0.28/0.40, and 0.48/0.49). In conclusion, the proposed parallel group analysis makes it possible to correct for the trough-to-peak ratio for both baseline and placebo, to account for inter-individual variability, and to calculate a confidence interval for the net trough. ratio. Taking into account inter-individual variability reduces the bottom-to-peak ratio. Smoothing unpredictably affects individualized net bottom-to-peak ratios and should therefore be avoided.",0,0

A report from the AIRE Labor Investigators.,,"Cleland, J G; Erhardt, L; Murray, G; Hall, A S; Ball, S G","The importance of the effects of ACE inhibitors on sudden death, progressive heart failure, and recurrent infarction in reducing overall mortality in heart failure and after myocardial infarction is controversial; The AIRE study randomized 2006 patients with clinical or radiological evidence of heart failure within 2–9 days following myocardial infarction to receive ramipiril 5 mg bd or corresponding placebo. Outcomes were independently evaluated by members of an endpoint committee who were blinded to treatment allocation; Fewer patients developed severe resistant heart failure as the first confirmed endpoint on rampril, despite a greater number of survivors at risk compared to placebo (n = 143 vs 178; risk reduction 23%; CI 5% to 39%; P = 0.017). Ramipril did not change the rate of re-infarction or stroke. Irrespective of treatment allocation, 182 (46%) patients developed refractory heart failure before death. A confirmed acute or distant myocardial reinfarction occurred in 76 (19%) patients before death, and chest pain occurred in 90 (23%) patients around the time of death, suggesting an ischemic element in these deaths. at readmission and 145 out of hospital. Sudden death was responsible for 54% of all deaths and 93% of out-of-hospital deaths. Ramipril reduced the risk of sudden death by 30% (95% CI: 8-47%; P = 0.011). Overall, however, 45% of patients who died suddenly had severe or worsening heart failure prior to their death. Only 39% of sudden deaths were thought to be due to arrhythmias. Ramipril reduced the risk of death from circulatory failure by 18%, but this did not reach statistical significance (95% CI; 41% to -14%; P = 0.237). The magnitude of the effects on sudden death and death from circulatory failure was not significantly different. However, 38% of the reduction in overall mortality was due to the subgroup with sudden death who had previously developed severe refractory heart failure (placebo n = 35, ramipril n = 15), again emphasizing significant benefit in preventing failure. Ramipril did not selectively change the rate of in- and out-of-hospital deaths; Ramipril reduces mortality and progression to resistant heart failure in patients with evidence of heart failure immediately after myocardial infarction. Delaying the progression of heart failure appears to be an important factor contributing to reduced mortality, both by reducing circulatory failure and by reducing sudden death.",1,1

Patients aged > or = 65 years showed a greater reduction in diastolic BP. Enalapril-felodipine ER combinations were associated with less drug-induced peripheral edema (4.1%) compared to felodipine ER monotherapy (10.8%). No serious drug-related side effects were observed during the study. In this trial, the combination of enalapril and felodipine ER effectively lowered BP and was generally well tolerated with an excellent safety profile when used to treat hypertension.",0,0

It was a crossover study with randomly assigned open treatments. Ten patients, 6 female and 4 male, with a mean age of 67.1 +/- 7.1 years were treated. Two washout periods with placebo were planned, each lasting one week before the start of active treatment; each treatment period lasted 21 days. Blood pressure checks (including 24-hour monitoring) were performed at baseline, seven days later, and at the end of each treatment. The results demonstrate the efficacy and safety of both drugs and confirm more effective and sustained control of hypertension with Quinapril.",0,0

This was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial involving 129 adult outpatients with essential hypertension. After confirmation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough during a 2 to 4 week lisinopril loading (followed by a 2-week washout), patients were randomized to receive 6 weeks of double-blind therapy with valsartan 80 mg once daily, lisinopril 10 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. . Evaluations were made at baseline and after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. Comparability of response to treatment was assessed by mean sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure at the end of treatment. The occurrence of a dry, persistent cough was significantly less (P < 0.001) with valsartan (19.5%) compared with lisinopril (68.9%) at weeks 3 and 6, and there was no significant difference between valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (19.0%). There was no statistically significant difference in blood pressure reduction between the three treatment groups. The overall incidence of adverse experiences, whether related to treatment or not, was highest for lisinopril (86.7%) compared with valsartan (57.1%) and hydrochlorothiazide (61.9%). Dry cough in the lisinopril group was responsible for this difference. Except for metabolic changes in 3 patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide, there were no clinically significant changes in physical signs or results of clinical laboratory evaluations during double-blind treatment. In hypertensive patients with a history of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough, valsartan 80 mg once daily produced therapeutic efficacy comparable to lisinopril, but with significantly less cough.",0,0
2087,9056614,Perindopril reduces blood pressure but not cerebral blood flow in patients with a recent cerebral ischemic stroke.,,"Dyker, A G; Grosset, D G; Lees, K","The relationship between high blood pressure and the incidence of stroke is well known. Currently, the effects of lowering blood pressure in patients with established cerebrovascular disease have not been established, and there are ongoing concerns regarding the management of patients immediately after a stroke. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors maintain cerebral blood flow despite lowering blood pressure in patients with heart failure and uncomplicated hypertension. We tested the hypothesis that perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with a gradual onset of action and a minimal first-dose hypotensive effect, lowers blood pressure in patients 2 to 7 days after symptoms of cerebral infarction without adversely affecting cerebral blood flow; Patients were randomized to receive 15 days of oral perindopril (4 mg) or placebo in a double-blind study. Blood pressure was monitored semi-automatically. Cerebral blood flow was calculated from internal carotid artery and vertebral Doppler ultrasound supplemented by middle cerebral artery blood velocities; Twenty-four patients completed the protocol; Four additional patients withdrew for reasons unrelated to treatment. Patients receiving perindopril had a 19/11 mm Hg-adjusted reduction in blood pressure compared to placebo. Blood pressure continued to drop after 2 weeks of treatment. In contrast, total cerebral blood flow was unaffected by perindopril. Neurological symptoms improved similarly in both groups; Perindopril was well tolerated and effectively lowered blood pressure in patients with recent symptoms of cerebral ischemia without reducing blood flow in the carotid region.",0,0

However, the mechanisms by which EPO may cause hypertension are still unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of EPO on endothelin (ET) synthesis and cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in vascular endothelial cells. Porcine endothelial cells were isolated from the thoracic aorta, pulmonary artery and vena cava. Studies were performed with cells of the first subculture. ET concentrations were measured radioimmunologically. Changes in [Ca2+]i were determined with the fluorescent probe fura-2. Cytotoxicity was assessed by sodium 3'-[1-(phenyl-amino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) assay. ET synthesis was similar and time dependent in cells of different vascular origin, reaching approximately 2 pmol ET/mg protein within 12 hours of incubation. EPO (12 to 200 U/mL) stimulated ET release time in the absence of fetal calf serum and heparin, and up to 83.2% (P < .01) within 12 hours, depending on the dose. EPO, sudden significant increase in [Ca2+]i from 58 +/- 12 nmol/L to 495 +/- 85 nmol/L (P < .01) followed by 257 +/- 3 nmol/L It made a slow turn. During the 2-hour incubation, Ca-ionophor A 23187 (10(-8) mol/L) moderately but significantly stimulated endothelial ET synthesis. However, the Ca-channel blocker verapamil, the intracellular Ca release blocker TMB-8, and the non-specific calcium channel blocker nickel, did not have a consistent effect on [Ca2+]i or ET synthesis. Protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 stimulated basal [Ca2+]i and cellular ET synthesis. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein suppressed [Ca2+]i and EPO-induced increase in cellular ET synthesis. From these data, we conclude that EPO can stimulate ET synthesis in vascular endothelial cells through intracellular signaling mechanisms including activation of an EPO receptor and activation of tyrosine kinase and an increase in [Ca2+]i. Thus, the systemic hypertensive effects of EPO may be due, at least in part, to local stimulation of vascular endothelial ET synthesis via calcium mobilization.",0,0

Experimental studies have shown that captopril administration reduces ET-1 secretion. It has also been reported that increased ET-1 levels are a negative prognostic index. The study sought to confirm whether captopril could reduce plasma ET levels in the acute and subacute phases of reperfused anterior AMI. Hospitalized for suspected anterior AMI within 4 hours of onset of symptoms, eligible for thrombolysis (first attack), Killip class I-2, randomized into two groups (double-blind): group A (23; seven women)/16 men) after thrombolysis initiation He took captopril (as a first dose) 2-4 hours later (then the dose was increased to 25 mg every 8 hours). Group B (22; five women/17 men) received placebo after thrombolysis. All patients met the reperfusion criteria.

2092,9061270,Lisinopril. A review of its pharmacology and clinical efficacy in elderly patients.,,"Langtry, H D; Markham, A","Lisinopril, the lysine analog of enalaprilat, is a once-daily orally administered long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The efficacy of lisinopril in lowering blood pressure is well established in younger populations, and many trials now show that it is effective in lowering blood pressure in elderly patients with hypertension. In comparative and non-comparative clinical studies, 68.2% to 89.1% of elderly patients (diastolic pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) responded to > or = 8 weeks of lisinopril treatment. Age-related differences in antihypertensive efficacy do not appear to be clinically relevant, and effective doses in elderly patients tend to range from 2.5 to 40 mg daily. Doses generally need to be lower in patients with significant renal impairment. In congestive heart failure, lisinopril 2.5 to 20 mg/day prolongs exercise time, improves left ventricular ejection fraction and has no significant effect on ventricular ectopic beats. Similar in efficacy to enalapril and digoxin and comparable or superior to captopril in most endpoints. Data from the post-myocardial infarction study GISSI-3 indicate that lisinopril reduces mortality and left ventricular dysfunction when given for 42 days starting within 24 hours of onset of infarct symptoms. Results at 6 weeks and 6 months were similar in older and younger patients. However, elderly patients, among other subgroups, exhibited a strong reduction in the risk of low ejection fraction (25.5) after treatment. Economic research shows that in some markets lisinopril offers cost savings compared to other ACE inhibitors. When given according to the GISSI-3 protocol, lisinopril appears to be one of the less expensive of the successful ACE inhibitor regimens for acute myocardial infarction. In other studies, patients with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension did not improve or worsen during treatment with lisinopril. Blood pressure was controlled and reductions or trends towards reductions in albuminuria were observed. These reductions were similar to those in recipients of diltiazem, nifedipine, and verapamil and were greater than those in patients receiving atenolol. Lisinopril appears to reduce mortality after myocardial infarction and ameliorate diabetes-related neuropathy in diabetic patients. Lisinopril is well tolerated and the profile of adverse events seen is typical for ACE inhibitors as a class. There is a trend for discontinuation in the elderly rather than younger patients, but this trend is not clearly associated with the incidence of adverse events in these age groups. Drug interactions occur with several other agents and are generally only clinically significant between lisinopril and diuretics or lithium. Lisinopril is therefore an effective treatment for elderly patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure and acute myocardial infarction and has shown promising benefits in patients with diabetic nephropathy.",0,0

2094,9067912,A short-term antihypertensive therapy-induced decrease in glomerular filtration rate predicts long-term stability of renal function.,,"Apperloo, A J; de Zeeuw, D; de Jong, P E","In long-term intervention studies on renal function outcome, an initial decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may occur after initiation of therapy. If this initial GFR reduction is the result of a treatment-related haemodynamic change reflecting a drop in intraglomerular pressure, it should be reversible after discontinuation of therapy, even after prolonged therapy. In fact, it may be beneficial for kidney function in the long run. Therefore, we examined systemic and renal hemodynamics in 40 non-diabetic patients with impaired renal function prior to treatment, during four years of treatment with atenolol or enalapril, and after this treatment was discontinued. The acute change in GFR 12 weeks after the start of treatment ranged widely from -11 to +11 ml/min (mean +/- SD -1.0 +/- 4.1 ml/min, NS). After four years of treatment, 12 weeks of abstinence resulted in an increase in GFR of +2.2 +/- 5.4 ml/min, P = 0.011, again over a wide range of +14 to -6 ml/min. The initial decrease in GFR was associated with the increase after withdrawal (r = 0.32, P < 0.05). Interestingly, acute treatment-induced change in GFR correlated with long-term slope, such that a patient with a greater baseline decline in GFR had a more stable course at follow-up (r = -0.36, P < 0.05). Patients were arbitrarily divided into group A (N = 20) with the largest treatment-related reduction in GFR and group B (N = 20) with the smallest initial decrease in GFR. During the four-year follow-up, Group A had significantly less steep slope than group B (-0.41 +/- 1.52 vs -2.09 +/- 2.79 ml/min/year, P = 0.023). GFR rose again after discontinuation of treatment in group A (+3.8 +/- 5.6 ml/min, P = 0.011) while it remained unchanged in group B (+0.5 +/- 4.0 ml/min, NS). In conclusion, post-treatment GFR was not different in group A (-2.5 +/- 7.2 ml/min, NS) compared to pre-treatment, whereas it was 5.9 +/- 12.1 ml/min lower in group B (P). = 0.023). Patients treated with enalapril had a similar response to patients treated with atenolol. In conclusion, the initial decline in GFR after initiation of antihypertensive therapy in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction (GFR 30 to 90 ml/min) is reversible even after years of treatment, suggesting that the treatment-related decline is not of hemodynamic or structural origin. This initial GFR reduction was associated with subsequent stable kidney function. These data lead to the hypothesis that the initial decrease in GFR in response to antihypertensive therapy reflects renal protection.",0,0
2095,9068723,Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angioedema.,,"Sabroe, R A; Black, A K","Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are increasingly used in the treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure and reduce mortality when given after myocardial infarction. Angioedema develops in 0.1-0.7% of patients prescribed these drugs, but this association is not widely recognized. In 60% of cases, onset occurs within the first week of treatment; however, it can be significantly delayed. Angioedema almost always occurs in the head and neck and often involves the mouth, tongue, pharynx, and larynx. The course is unpredictable and the severity of attacks ranges from mild to laryngeal obstruction to fatal. Severe ACEI-induced angioedema may require emergency treatment with adrenaline and early intubation. In any patient presenting with ACEI-induced angioedema, the drug should be discontinued and treatment continued with an appropriate drug of a different class.

Verapamil prevents cardiac events after AMI in patients without CHF. We hypothesized that in patients with post-infarction heart failure who have already been prescribed diuretics and an ACE inhibitor, adjunctive therapy with verapamil may reduce the rate of cardiac events. In this multicenter, double-blind study, patients with CHF receiving diuretic therapy were randomized to treatment with trandolapril 1 mg daily for 1 month consecutively and trandolapril 2 mg/day for 2 months thereafter or trandolapril as indicated. verapamil 240 mg/day for 1 month and 360 mg/day for 2 months (n = 51).

An open, randomized, controlled multicenter study of 36 weeks, involving 189 physicians and 69 nurses, was conducted in 155 primary and occupational health care centers in Finland. The study population consisted of 1156 patients aged 30-70 years (mean DBP 95-115 mmHg at the last three to five measurements at follow-up). The number of patients who reached target pressure (DBP < 90 mmHg) at the end of the study, defined daily doses (DDD) of antihypertensive drugs, and side effects in different treatment groups were considered the main outcome measures of the study. After exclusions and dropouts, the final analysis was conducted with 900 patients, 419 women (46.6%) and 481 men (53.4%). Patients receiving lisinopril treatment achieved target pressure significantly more frequently than those who continued their previous or adjusted medication (p < 0.001) at 36 weeks (40.3% and 42.7% versus 59.2% and 55.5%). Only a minor, but not statistically significant, blood pressure lowering effect was achieved with intensified non-pharmacological therapy at weeks 12 and 24, but this difference disappeared at week 36.

We studied seven patients with chronic heart failure randomized to receive candoxatril, candoxatril/captopril, captopril, and placebo in a four-way crossover, double-blind model; Mean circulating endothelin level (ET) increased 2 hours after placebo (10 to 20 pg ml-1), as well as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (27 to 51 pg ml-1), but ANP levels changed little during placebo. this time (73 to 75 pg ml-1). However, ET (10 to 39 pg ml-1, P < 0.05), CGRP (34 to 99 pg ml-1, P < 0.05) and ANP (72 to 108 pg ml-1, P < 0.05) increased following candoxatril. .

Cough was detected by a questionnaire (primary endpoint) given to elderly patients with hypertension and cough frequency was measured with a visual analog scale (a secondary endpoint). A total of 84 elderly patients, all non-smokers with ACe inhibitor-induced cough and reconfirmed with lisinopril followed by placebo, with hypertension were randomized into three treatment groups. The incidence of cough with losartan (18%) was significantly lower than with lisinopril (97%) and similar with metolazone (21%). Cough frequency assessed by visual analog scale was significantly lower for losartan than for lisinopril and similar to that for metolazone.

The study group consisted of 29 elderly patients with hypertension (mean age, 69 years) divided into two groups: 15 patients received nifedipine (group N) and 14 patients received enalapril (group E). In group N, systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced and the low frequency coefficient of component variance, normalized low frequency: high frequency ratio, and percent changes in plasma norepinephrine concentration changed significantly with nifedipine administration. Group E, in contrast, did not show a significant decrease in SBP and the percentage of change in the high frequency coefficient of component variance only increased significantly after administration of enalapril.

Acute myocardial ischemia superimposed on ventricles damaged from previous infarctions has been shown to increase the occurrence of fatal ventricular arrhythmias. This is a retrospective analysis of 6,797 participants in the Left Ventricular Dysfunction Prevention and Treatment Studies. Both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling were used to examine the association of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy with the risk of sudden cardiac death. The following covariates were adjusted in the analysis: age, ejection fraction, gender, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, history of angina, previous infarction, previous revascularization, and regular use of beta-blockers, diuretics, digoxin, antiarrhythmic agents, or enalapril. The overall incidence of sudden cardiac death per 100 patient-years of follow-up was 2.24%. In multivariate analysis, antiplatelet and anticoagulant monotherapy each remained independently associated with a reduction in the risk of sudden cardiac death: antiplatelet therapy with 24% reduction (relative risk [RR] 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.95) and 32%. antiplatelet monotherapy (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.48-0.96) with reduction.

This article describes an attempt to address this challenge. ACE activity in serum and non-centrifuged skeletal muscle homogenates was measured by a fluorometric assay before and during treatment in 24 hypertensives treated with fosinopril and 26 hypertensives treated with atenolol. The absolute difference in activity between high and low of two different sample dilutions divided by the mean activity was taken to represent competitive inhibition in the sample, the ""inhibitor index"". The reduction in muscle ACE activity corresponding to fosinopril treatment was not statistically significant (-2.6%, p = 0.68). However, the inhibitor index increased by 46% (p = 0.045) and no change was seen in the atenolol-treated group (-12%, p = 0.51). The change in muscle inhibitor index (but not the decrease in serum ACE activity) was inversely proportional to the change in blood pressure (r = -0.50, p = 0.034) and serum aldosterone (r = -0.54, p = 0.031) in fosinopril. group, but not the atenolol group.

Our hypothesis is that ACE inhibitors improve pulmonary function in chronic heart failure (CHF) by re-adjusting lung vascular tone and permeability or alveolar-capillary membrane diffusion; In 16 CHF patients and 16 normal volunteers or mildly untreated hypertensives, pulmonary function and exercise tests with respiratory gas analysis were evaluated on placebo, enalapril (10 mg BID), enalapril plus aspirin (325 mg/day), or aspirin, in random order. and double-blind, 15 days each. In CHF, enalapril increased pulmonary carbon monoxide diffusion (DLCO), oxygen consumption (VO2) and exercise tolerance, and decreased dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) and respiratory equivalent for carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2). . In enalapril, VO2 (r = .80, P < .0001) and VD/VT (r = -.69, P = .003) vary from placebo in correlation with those in DLCO. These effects were blocked by aspirin and were absent in control subjects. In 8 additional patients, hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate as an alternative therapy to reduce pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and increase exercise capacity was more effective than enalapril for PCWP, but did not affect DLCO and VE/VCO2; The improvement in VO2 and VD/VT was not related to DLCO and was not altered by aspirin; ACE inhibition improved pulmonary diffusion in CHF. Hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate failed to achieve this result.

We also analyzed changes in left ventricular volumes after study drug discontinuation. One of the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition after AMI is reduced enlargement of the left ventricle. However, the nature of this effect is not fully understood; We included 89 patients with a radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45% within 48 hours of the onset of the first AMI. The study was double-blind and compared enalapril with placebo in a crossover design. All patients were randomly assigned to sequence A (enalapril, 45 days; placebo, 45 days) or B (placebo, 45 days; enalapril, 45 days). The endpoint was the change in left ventricular volume at days 45 and 90. Thrombolysis was applied to 26 (70%) patients in group A and 25 (75%) patients in group B. All clinical variables before treatment were similar in both groups.

Thirteen smokers were recruited using 50 mg captopril and placebo in a randomized, single-dose, double-blind, crossover fashion, followed by two high-nicotine cigarettes within 15 minutes. Blood samples were taken at frequent intervals before, during and after smoking. We found that the increase in plasma adrenaline concentration during smoking was moderate. There was no difference between captopril treatment compared to placebo. Thus, the adrenaline response to smoking was not blunted by acute blockade of the angiotensin II generation. A significant increase in heart rate and blood pressure was also found. No increase in plasma noradrenaline concentration was found. While plasma renin concentration increased significantly during captopril treatment, it decreased during the study period in the placebo phase. Plasma angiotensin II concentration decreased during the study period in both captopril treatment and placebo phase, but this was more pronounced during captopril treatment. In conclusion, the activation of the sympathetic nervous system caused by smoking was not blunted by the acute ACE inhibition by captopril. This indicates that angiotensin II does not facilitate smoking-induced activation of sympathoadrenal activity in humans.",0,0

Measurements included random-zero, clinical orthostatic, and home blood pressure. In total, 184 subjects completed the 12-month treatment period. Prior to treatment, clinical supine BP was 165 +/- 15/105 +/- 5 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic), 24-hour mean BP was 149 +/- 16/95 +/- 11 mm Hg, and LVMI was 158 +/- 32 g /m2.

Before treatment, LVMI did not correlate with clinical BP, but showed a correlation with systolic and diastolic 24-hour mean BP (r = .34/.27, P < .01). The LVMI reduction was not related to the reduction in clinical BP, but was related to the reduction in mean 24-hour BP (r = .42/.38, P < .01). Treatment-related changes in mean daytime and nighttime BP correlated as strongly with changes in LVMI as did 24-hour BP changes. No significant advantage has been demonstrated with clinical orthostatic, random-zero, and home BP over clinical supine BP; In hypertensive subjects with LVH, regression of LVH by treatment-related changes in ABP was predicted much more closely than in clinical BP.

Ozagrel was given for 1 to 2 months in combination with ACE inhibitors in 11 patients with hypertension who developed cough caused by ACE inhibitors, a TXA2 synthetase inhibitor. One patient developed an ozagrel-induced headache and was withdrawn from the study 3 weeks later. In the other 10 patients, no significant drug-attributable abnormalities in subjective and objective symptoms or laboratory tests were observed. Cough scores were obtained in ten patients immediately before and after administration of an ACE inhibitor combination with ozagrel. The median values of cough scores after the combination were significantly (p=0.012) lower than before the combination. Ozagrel reduced cough scores in 5 patients, suppressed cough completely in 3 patients, and did not affect cough scores in 2 of 10 patients.

CONSENSUS II Holter Sub-Working Group.,,"SÃ¸gaard, P; Thygesen, K","The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between early hemodynamic instability and myocardial ischemia and the effect of early intravenous enalapril treatment on this relationship. Early treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is controversial in patients with myocardial infarction (MI). In hypotensive patients, initiation of therapy may exacerbate myocardial ischemia and thus affect clinical outcome. Therefore, in the CONSENSUS II trial, a total of 60 patients randomly assigned to intravenous enalapril or placebo therapy starting within 24 hours of MI onset were evaluated with repeated blood pressure measurements, pre-discharge ambulatory ST-segment monitoring, and exercise testing. 34 patients had significant ST depression. Patients with ST depression before discharge (residual ischemia), without ST depression during exercise testing or ambulatory monitoring, or both (n = 24) had a mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) decrease of 20 versus 9 mm Hg at baseline ( n = 24), (p < 0.00001).

It measured the efficacy of lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in reducing echocardiographic signs of MR severity over a one-year period. Severe coronary disease was excluded by stress echocardiography. Treatment efficacy was estimated to be proportional to the reduction in MR fraction and heart chamber dimensions compared to baseline based on the intent-to-treat analysis. A final patient population of 23 asymptomatic adults 53.3 +/- 2.4 years old (mean +/- SEM) with moderate, organic MR and normal left ventricular function was selected from the echocardiographic database. All baseline patient characteristics were comparable in the two treatment groups, including the MR fraction (55 +/- 3%). Twelve patients received lisinopril (18 +/- 1 mg) and 11 patients received placebo. After one year of treatment, a statistically significant difference in MR fraction was observed between the two groups. The MR fraction for the lisinopril group decreased by 6.4% +/- 3.5% from baseline and increased by 3.7% +/- 3.2% for the placebo group (P < 0.05). No differences in left atrial or ventricular dimensions were observed.

Based on available evidence, despite similar antihypertensive efficacy, the renoprotective effects of lisinopril appear to be greater than with comparative calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and beta-blockers. As demonstrated in the EUCLID (EUrodiab Controlled Lisinopril in Insulin-Dependent Diabetes) study, lisinopril is also renoprotective in normotensive patients with IDDM and microalbuminuria. The effect in normotensive patients with normoalbuminuria was smaller than in patients with microalbuminuria, and no conclusions can yet be drawn regarding its use in patients with normoalbuminuria. Lisinopril has shown some benefit in complications other than nephropathy. In the EUCLID study, progression to retinopathy was slowed during 2 years of lisinopril treatment. Although not yet fully published, these results provide the most convincing evidence to date for the effect of an ACE inhibitor in retinopathy. The drug may also improve neurological function, but this finding is preliminary. Finally, post hoc analysis of the GISSI-3 trial shows that lisinopril reduces the 6-week mortality rate in diabetic patients when treatment is started early following acute myocardial infarction. The tolerability profile of lisinopril is typical for ACE inhibitors and appears to be similar in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. As demonstrated in the EUCLID study, hypoglycaemia occurred with similar frequency to lisinopril and placebo. In addition, the GISSI-3 study shows an increased incidence of persistent hypotension and renal dysfunction with lisinopril overall, although the presence of diabetes does not appear to pose an additional risk for these events in diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarction receiving lisinopril. In summary, lisinopril lowers blood pressure and produces a renoprotective effect in patients with IDDM and NIDDM without impairing glycemic control or lipid profiles. Like other ACE inhibitors, lisinopril should therefore be viewed as a first-line agent for lowering blood pressure and preventing or alleviating nephropathy in hypertensive diabetic patients with IDDM or NIDDM and microalbuminuria or overt kidney disease. The EUCLID trial using lisinopril provides new data supporting an additional place in the management of normotensive patients with microalbuminuria and IDDM. These findings suggest a broader role for the drug in the management of diabetic vascular complications, with some evidence for the efficacy of lisinopril in delaying the progression of retinopathy and reducing mortality.",0,0

EDEN Research Investigators.,,,"To examine the effects of early use of enalapril on left ventricular function and exercise capacity after the first acute myocardial infarction, 356 patients without overt signs of heart failure were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or enalapril between days 7 and 14 following their first myocardial infarction. . The study was double-blind in 40 hospitals across Spain; At baseline and after 26 weeks of follow-up exercise stress tests, study participants underwent Doppler-echocardiograms and isotopic ventriculography. At the end of follow-up, patients in the enalapril group had lower systolic volume compared to those in the placebo group (55 vs. 62 ml; P=0.05). There was no significant difference in exercise capacity between the two groups; This study demonstrates that enalapril therapy administered 7 to 14 days after the first acute myocardial infarction reduces the end-systolic volume and can inhibit the left ventricular remodeling process.",1,0

A multicenter, placebo-leading double-blind, parallel group study was conducted to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and renal hemodynamic response with the ACE inhibitor fosinopril (n = 14) and lisinopril (n = 13) once daily over a 22-week period. period. The aim of the study was to reduce diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to 90 mm Hg or less. Furosemide was added 6 weeks later if the blood pressure target was not achieved. 27 elderly hypertensive patients (> or = 45 years; 12 black, 15 non-black; 19 men, eight women) with DBP 95 mm Hg or higher and 4-hour creatinine clearance 20 to 70 mL/day in outpatient clinics at university medical centers min/1.73 m2 worked. Changes from baseline (delta) in BP, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and renal plasma flow (RPF) were measured. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP were significantly and similarly reduced in the randomized groups: fosinopril (mean +/- SEM) delta DBP at 6 weeks was -13 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -16 to - 9) and -12 +/- 2 at 22 weeks (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -16 to -9); lisinopril delta DBP was -14 +/- 6 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -10 to -18) at week 6 and -16 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -12) at week 22 . until -21). GFR and RPF were not significantly changed in either group. BP was significantly reduced and was similar in blacks and non-blacks: delta DBP in blacks -11 +/- 3 (P < 0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 to -9) at week 6 and -16 +/- 2 at week 22 ( P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -11 to -20); for non-blacks, delta DBP -14 +/- 1 at week 6 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -12 to -17) and -12 +/- 2 at week 22 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, - 16 to -8). Eight patients (five black and three non-black) required the addition of furosemide 6 weeks later to reach the DBP target of < or = 90 mm Hg at 22 weeks. GFR did not change significantly for either breed group at 6 weeks; but at 22 weeks; however, at 22 weeks, GFR was significantly reduced in blacks (delta GFR, -16 +/- 5; P < 0.006; 95% CI, -26 to -5) and tended to increase in non-blacks (delta GFR, 7 +/- 6; P > 0.25). delta GFR is directly related to delta RPF (delta GFR = 0.0611* delta RPF -2.35 +; r = 0.68; P < 0.003). There was no correlation between delta MAP and delta GFR or delta RPF in blacks or non-blacks. We conclude that chronic ACE inhibition with fosinopril and lisinopril alone or in combination with furosemide lowers blood pressure in elderly blacks and non-blacks with hypertension and chronic renal failure. Racial differences in renal haemodynamic response to chronic ACE inhibition have been noted and appear to be independent of diuretic use and magnitude of BP reduction.",0,0

Aspirin (ASA) has become a well-documented therapeutic adjunct in patients with coronary heart disease. Recently, attention has focused on a possible interaction between ASA and ACE inhibitors. Therefore, we reanalyzed data from the Cooperative New Nordic Enalapril Survival Study II (CONSENSUS II) to find any evidence of differential effects of the ACE inhibitor enalapril in subgroups identified initially with ASA use. Logistic regression tested the multiplicative interaction. We used the Rothman synergy index S, which will equal unity under additiveness and be less than one when antagonism is suggested, to examine the putative interaction with departure from an additive model. Logistic regression showed that the term enalapril-ASA interaction was a significant predictor of mortality at the end of the study (p = 0.047) and a borderline significant predictor of mortality 30 days after randomization (p = 0.085). The Rothman synergy index S was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.94) for mortality at study end and 0.68 (0.44 to 1.04) for 30-day mortality; . Thus, we found evidence of enalapril-ASA interaction. The effect of enalapril was less favorable in patients receiving ASA than in patients not receiving ASA at baseline.",0,0

The early, low-dose ramipril (0.625 mg) arm was also evaluated. Clinical events did not differ. During the first 14 days, both ramipril groups had an increased risk of developing systolic arterial pressure < or = 90 mm Hg. LVEF increased in all groups during this period, but the early, full-dose ramipril group had the greatest improvement in EF (increase: complete, 4.9 +/- 10.0; low, 3.9 +/- 8.2%; delayed , 2.4 +/- 8.8%; P < .05 for trend) and were the only group to show no significant increase in LV diastolic area; The results of this study showed that early use of ramipril (titrated to 10 mg) in patients with anterior MI reduced LV remodeling and was associated with faster recovery of LVEF. Use of the low-dose regimen did not prevent hypotension and produced only moderate benefit on LV size and function. The more favorable effects of early use of full-dose ramipril on LV topography support the results of large clinical trials demonstrating an early survival benefit of ACE inhibition.",0,0

Clinical pharmacokinetics and clinical potential.,,"Shionoiri, H; Naruse, M; Minamisawa, K; Ueda, S; Himeno, H; Hiroto, S; Takasaki, I","Fosinopril is a phosphorus-containing ester prodrug of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It is hydrolyzed mainly in the gastrointestinal mucosa and liver to the active diacid, fosinoprilat, which has unique pharmacological properties. Most of the active parts of other ACE inhibitors are excreted in the urine. This means that in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction, an adjustment in dosage and/or administration interval is required to reduce drug accumulation and the possibility of excessive blood pressure drop or other side effects. On the other hand, fosinoprilat is excreted both in the urine and in the bile (as with temocaprylate, zofenoprilat, and spiraprilat) and therefore in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction, adjustment of dosage and/or administration interval may not be necessary due to impaired renal function. has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of fosinoprilat. In addition, available evidence suggests that the pharmacokinetic variants of fosinoprilat in patients receiving hemodialysis are similar to those in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction. Dose changes or additional dosing following dialysis may be unnecessary. The hypotensive effect of the combination of fosinopril and diuretic is synergistic. Pharmacokinetic interactions with fosinopril are unlikely in patients receiving thiazide or loop diuretics. Fosinopril has beneficial effects in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, as it provides an adequate reduction in blood pressure and reverses left ventricular hypertrophy. There are many studies on the pharmacokinetics of fosinopril. However, studies of pharmacokinetic drug interactions with other drugs are much less frequent.

Sporadic cases of angioedema secondary to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been reported in the literature. The overall incidence is approximately 0.1% to 0.2% and the onset time is usually within the first week of ACEI therapy. Late-onset angioedema secondary to ACEI therapy is much more common than anticipated and is largely unrecognized due to the lack of a temporal correlation between ACEI therapy and the development of angioedema. Since angioedema may progress to upper airway obstruction, otolaryngologists should be aware of this association. Most importantly, late-onset angioedema should prompt the clinician to discontinue ACEI immediately to avoid further morbidity. This report presents an example of late-onset angioedema resulting from incidental double-dose captopril ingestion.

2166,9211084,Fosinopril. A review of its pharmacology and clinical efficacy in the management of heart failure.,,"Davis, R; Coukell, A; McTavish, D","Fosinopril is a prodrug of the active diacid ACE inhibitor fosinoprilat. In patients with heart failure, fosinopril decreases pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, mean right atrial pressure, and heart rate, and increases the stroke volume index and cardiac index. The drug has compensatory dual elimination routes through the renal and hepatic systems and has a lower rate of accumulation than enalapril and lisinopril in patients with chronic renal failure with or without heart failure. Comparative studies of 3 or 6 month duration with fosinopril 10 to 40 mg/day demonstrated clinical efficacy significantly superior to placebo in patients with heart failure [mostly New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III]. Fosinopril treatment consistently increased exercise time and improved heart failure symptoms in these patients. Significantly fewer fosinopril were withdrawn or hospitalized for worsening heart failure than placebo recipients. In addition, significantly more fosinopril improved than placebo recipients, and fewer patients worsened in terms of NYHA functional class. Fosinopril and enalapril demonstrated similar clinical efficacy during 6 and 12 months of treatment in patients with NYHA functional class II to IV heart failure. As yet, there are no data showing a mortality benefit with fosinopril. Fosinopril was well tolerated in clinical studies in patients with heart failure. Dizziness (11.9% vs. 5.4% for placebo), cough (5.1% vs. 9.7%) and hypotension (4.4% vs. 0.8%) were the most frequently reported adverse events. In 6- or 12-month comparative studies, treatment with fosinopril was associated with a lower incidence of dizziness and hypotension, but a higher incidence of vertigo, than treatment with enalapril. 0.8% of patients discontinued the drug due to cough occurring to a similar extent with fosinopril and enalapril. Therefore, based on the available clinical evidence, fosinopril is an effective and well tolerated option for the treatment of patients with heart failure. Although clinical data are limited, fosinopril may be particularly beneficial in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.",0,0

This study shows that the antihypertensive effect is dependent on baseline ambulatory BP values and the BP reduction was lower in the Low group. Evaluation of the antihypertensive effect on ambulatory BP is useful in clinical studies.",0,0
2168,9215232,Rationale and design features of a clinical trial examining the effects of cholesterol-lowering and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on coronary atherosclerosis: Simvastatin/Enalapril Coronary Atherosclerosis Trial (SCAT). SCAT Inspectors.,,"Teo, K K; Burton, J R; Buller, C; Plante, S; Yokoyama, S; Montague, T J","The mechanisms by which lipid lowering, a proven therapy, produces beneficial clinical effects in the treatment of coronary atherosclerotic artery disease (CAD) remain unclear. In addition, although the potential mechanisms of benefit are well known and increasingly applied clinically, conclusive data from clinical trials examining the primarily antiischemic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in patients with normal heart function are lacking. The Simvastatin/Enalapril Coronary Atherosclerosis Trial (SCAT) is designed to clarify some of these issues in CAD patients with normal or mildly elevated cholesterol. DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES: SCAT is a three- to five-year, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial study evaluating the effects of cholesterol-lowering therapy with simvastatin and/or ACE inhibition with enalapril on anatomical coronary atherosclerosis. progression as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography in CAD patients with preserved left ventricular function and total cholesterol levels between 4.1 and 6.2 mmol/L; Of 460 patients (age 61 +/- 9 years; 409 males, 51 females) enrolled between June 1991 and July 1995, 230 were randomized to simvastatin and 230 to placebo, 229 to enalapril and 231 to placebo. Mean baseline total cholesterol level was 5.20 +/- 0.61 mmol/L, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 0.99 +/- 0.25 mmol/L, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 3.36 +/- 0.57 mmol/L, and triglycerides were 1.82 +/- 0.75 mmol/L . The trial will conclude in June 1998; Information from this long-term angiographic trial will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of benefit of these two treatments, both individually and in combination. Of particular interest is that this trial could examine a suspected beneficial interaction, if any, between these two treatments.",0,0
2169,9217714,Thromboxane antagonism and cough induced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.,,"Malini, P L; Strocchi, E; Zanardi, M; Milani, M; Ambrosioni, E","It has been suggested that increased prostaglandin synthesis, which may follow the arachidonic acid cascade stimulation by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACE-I), underlies the appearance of cough in ACE-I therapy. We investigated the involvement of prostanoid thromboxane; Nine patients with essential hypertension who coughed (coughs) after 20 mg of enalapril once daily were treated while continuing enalapril in a double-blind crossover study with placebo 600 mg twice daily or picotamide. Picotamide is a platelet antiaggregant that acts through both inhibition of thromboxane synthase and thromboxane-receptor antagonism. Thirteen hypertensive patients with no history of ACE-I-induced cough were also treated with enalapril and used as controls. Cough frequency was measured with a visual analog scale and a daily cough diary. The 24-hour urinary recovery of 11-dehydro-thromboxane-B2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was measured to evaluate any changes in endoperoxide metabolism during the study periods; The recovery of 11-dehydro-thromboxane-B2 (TXB2) was significantly reduced by picotamide, resulting in resolution of cough within 72 hours in eight patients. Picotamide urine recovery data suggested incomplete absorption in non-responders. At baseline and after re-administration with enalapril, 11-dehydro-TXB2 excretion was within the same range in controls and coughs, but the latter showed significantly lower 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion and their ratio to 11-dehydroTXB2. 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was twice that of controls (1.40 [95% CI 0.86-1.95] and 0.61 [0.37-0.84]); A thromboxane antagonist is effective in ACE-I-induced cough. An imbalance between thromboxane and prostacyclin may represent a marker of patients susceptible to ACE-I-induced cough.",0,0

GISEN Group (Gruppo Italiano di Studi Epidemiologici in Nephrologia)",,,"In diabetic nephropathy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a greater effect than other antihypertensive drugs on proteinuria and progressive decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It is unclear whether this difference applies to the progression of nondiabetic proteinuric nephropathies. The Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy study in chronic non-diabetic nephropathies aimed to address whether glomerular protein trafficking influences the progression of kidney disease and whether an ACE inhibitor is superior to conventional therapy with the same blood pressure control in reducing proteinuria, limiting GFR reduction. and prevention of end-stage renal disease; In this prospective double-blind study, 352 patients were stratified by baseline proteinuria (tier 1: 1-3 g/24 h; tier 2: > or = 3 g/24 h) and randomly assigned ramipril or placebo plus conventional antihypertensive 90 mm Hg. Treatment aimed at achieving diastolic blood pressure below The primary endpoint was the GFR decline rate. The analysis was therapeutic; In the second planned interim analysis, the difference in GFR reduction between the ramipril and placebo groups in tier 2 was highly significant (p = 0.001). Therefore, the Independent Judging Panel decided to open the randomization code and perform the final analysis at this tier (tier 1 continued in the trial). Data (at least three GFR measurements including baseline) were available for 56 patients assigned ramipril and 61 patients assigned placebo. The decrease in GFR at month was significantly lower in the ramipril group than in the placebo group (0.53 [0.08] vs. 0.88 [0.13] mL/min, p = 0.03). Among patients assigned ramipril, the percentage reduction in proteinuria was inversely proportional to reduction in GFR (p = 0.035) and predicted a reduction in the risk of doubling of baseline creatinine or end-stage renal disease (18 ramipril vs 40 placebo, p = 0.04). The risk of progression was still significantly reduced after adjusting for changes in systolic (p = 0.04) and diastolic (p = 0.04) blood pressure, but not after adjusting for changes in proteinuria. Blood pressure control and total number of cardiovascular events were similar in the two treatment groups; In chronic nephropathies with proteinuria of 3 g or more per 24 hours, ramipril safely reduces proteinuria, and the rate of GFR reduction appears to exceed the reduction expected for the degree of blood pressure reduction.",1,0

These effects may be mediated, at least in part, by suppression of fatal ventricular tachycardia (VT). The aim of this study was to examine whether the ACE inhibitor cilazapril attenuates ventricular arrhythmias in patients with congestive heart failure and to determine if this reduction is associated with suppression of sympathetic nerve activity in these patients, if cilazapril reduces ventricular arrhythmia. Thirty-two congestive heart failure patients with VTs (Low grade IVa or IVb) (left ventricular ejection fraction, 35% +/- 6%; New York Heart Association class II or III) were randomly assigned to receive conventional therapy consisting of diuretics. and digitalis (control group) or conventional therapy plus cilazapril (cilazapril group). Twenty-four-hour outpatient electrocardiographic monitoring was performed at baseline and after 2 months of treatment. Plasma norepinephrine levels and heart rate variability (standard deviation about the mean RR interval) were compared at baseline and after 2 months of treatment. The control group showed no significant change in arrhythmia frequency after 2 months of treatment. However, the number of ventricular pairs and VT runs was significantly reduced in the cilazapril group. Associated with this reduction, plasma norepinephrine levels decreased and heart rate variability increased. These results suggest that cilazapril has antiarrhythmic effects that can be produced by suppressing high sympathetic activity in patients with congestive heart failure. It should be noted that the study group was small and although the ventricular dysrhythmia decreased with therapy, it remained at a significant level. More studies are needed to confirm these results and identify the exact causes of the reduction.",0,0

We recently reported potent sodium retention and renal vasoconstriction during pathophysiological increases in plasma ET-1. In addition to this vasoconstrictor effect, ET-1 also has mitogenic properties that play a role in the pathophysiology of hypertension. On the other hand, some data contradict the important role of ET-1 in hypertension. Therefore, we investigated the constrictive effects of ET-1 in nine subjects with essential hypertension by challenging these subjects with a systemic infusion of ET-1 (0.5 ng/kg/min for 60 min followed by 1.0 ng/kg/min for 60 min). and finally 2.0 ng/kg per minute for 60 minutes). We also investigated whether these effects of ET-1 could be modulated by oral use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg BID) or the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (60 mg OD). ET-1 infusion increased plasma ET-1 levels from 2.5+/-0.4 to 11.6+/-1.0 pmol/L (P<.05). Blood pressure increased approximately 10 mm Hg (P<.05). The cardiac index decreased by 21%+/-22%, while the calculated systemic vascular resistance increased by 27±6% (P<.05). At the end of the ET-1 infusion, renal blood flow decreased from 1051+/-94 to 707+/-60 mL/min (P<.05) and the calculated renal vascular resistance increased from 118+/-19 to 189+/ -19 mm Hg x min/L (P<.05). Sodium excretion decreased from 227+/-39 to 111+/-15 micromol/min (P<.05). Treatment with both enalapril and nifedipine prevented the systemic effects of ET-1 infusion in these subjects. However, despite renal predilation during treatment with enalapril, ET-1 decreased renal blood flow (from 1119+/-132 to 701+/-75 mL/min, P<.05) and increased renal vascular resistance (111+/-75 mL/min). /- to 16 to 187+/-28 mm Hg x min/L, P<.05) to the same levels as during ET-1 infusion alone.

Although neither drug modulated the antinatriuretic effect of ET-1, nifedipine increased basal sodium excretion (P<.05), which compensated for the decrease during ET-1 infusion.

Both enalapril and nifedipine can inhibit the systemic effects of ET-1, but nifedipine appears to be more effective at reducing the renal-constricting effects of ET-1.",0,0

Patients with an office diastolic pressure of 90 to 109 mm Hg were randomized to treatment with daily doses of lisinopril (10, 20, or 40 mg), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5, 25, or 50 mg), or placebo. Mean body mass indexes were similar for all patients. At week 12, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide reduced office diastolic (-8.3 and -7.7 versus -3.3 mm Hg; P<.005, respectively) and systolic (-9.2 and -10.0 versus -4.6 mm Hg, respectively; P <.05) effectively lowered it; ) pressures compared with placebo. Outpatient blood pressure monitoring confirmed that lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide effectively lowered 24-hour blood pressure compared to placebo (P<.001). Significant dose-response differences were observed between treatments. Sixty percent of lisinopril-treated patients had office diastolic pressure <90 mm Hg compared to 43% of hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients (P<.05). Responses to treatments differed by both race and age. Neither treatment significantly affected insulin or lipid profiles; however, plasma glucose increased significantly (+0.31 vs -0.21 mmol/L; P<.001) after 12 weeks of hydrochlorothiazide treatment compared with lisinopril. Hydrochlorothiazide also reduced serum potassium levels by 0.4 mmol/L from baseline. In conclusion, lisinopril was as effective as hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of obese patients with hypertension.

In addition, treated hypertensive patients still have a higher rate of cardiovascular complications compared with matched normotensives. This is particularly evident in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), an important independent risk indicator for cardiovascular disease. In addition to raising blood pressure, angiotensin II (A-II) has a significant effect on cardiac structure and function, stimulating cell proliferation and growth. Therefore, it may be important to effectively block the effects of A-II to further reduce morbidity and mortality when treating hypertensive patients. This can be achieved directly at the A-II receptor level by losartan, the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents. Therefore, it seems appropriate to investigate whether selective A-II receptor blockade with losartan not only lowers blood pressure but also reduces LVH more effectively than current therapy, thus improving prognosis.

However, it is unknown whether this is due to abolition of angiotensin (Ang) II production or to reduced degradation of bradykinin; Method in eight normotensive patients with angiographic evidence of mild left coronary artery lesions (< or = 50%), mean arterial pressure (MAP, intra-arterial catheter), heart rate (HR, EKG lead), coronary sinus blood flow (CBF, thermodilution). ) and coronary vascular resistance (ratio between CVR, MAP, and CBF) were measured before and during a 15-minute left intracoronary infusion of Ang II at a dose without direct coronary or systemic vasomotor effects. The same measurements were made before and during a 15-minute saline infusion. At the end of both infusion periods, a 2-minute cold press test (CPT) and a 45-second dive were performed. These maneuvers have been used because their coronary vasomotor effects are abolished by phentolamine and thus due to sympathetic activation. Both CPT and diving during the saline infusion resulted in a significant increase in MAP. HR increased with CPT and decreased with diving. CBF increased in line with MAP increase with little change in CVR. MAP and HR responses were similar during Ang II infusion, but this resulted in either no change or a decrease in CBF with a significant increase in CVR with both CPT and diving. In four additional patients, the diameter of the stenotic vessels remained unchanged during CPT under saline and Ang II infusion; Ang II markedly enhances the sympathetic effects on the coronary circulation in humans, presumably by acting at the arteriolar level. This may explain the blunting effect of ACE inhibition on sympathetic coronary vasoconstriction in patients with coronary artery disease.",0,0

Accordingly, we determined PSNA by heart rate variability (HRV) analysis in nine patients (four women and five men, aged 73.6 +/- 6) with heart failure (NYHA Class II-III) and sinus rhythm. HRV was determined initially during 20-40 minutes of supine rest, followed by increasing oral captopril dose, 12.5 mg twice daily, 25 mg twice daily, and 50 mg twice daily, at 2-week intervals during the Poincaré plot and conventional time and frequency domain measurements. was used to analyze the data. Low dose captopril (12.5 mg twice) induced an increase in SD delta RR (16.0 +/- 6.6 to 22.0 +/- 9.1 ms; p < 0.05). We have previously validated this as a PSNA measure. Higher doses of captopril (25 mg twice daily) caused an increase in PSNA activity (16.0 +/- 6.6 to 18.7 +/- 7.8 ms), but this did not reach statistical significance. However, the highest dose of captopril (50 mg twice daily) reduced PSNA activity to near baseline values, as demonstrated by HRV measurements in both the time and frequency domains.

2207,9282581,The effect of enalapril on renal profile and right ventricular dimensions in chronic cor pulmonale.,,"Mahajan, S K; Sharma, V K; Thakral, S","The efficacy of enalapril in combination with bronchodilators, diuretics, antibiotics and/or steroids was compared with conventional therapy with diuretics, steroids and antibiotics alone in 30 patients with chronic cor-pulmonale. The effect was studied on right ventricular dimensions and kidney profile after a 6-week treatment period. Control patients showed a significant decrease in RVIDED and an increase in GFR, but the decrease in RVAWT and the increase in 'a' wave amplitude were insignificant. However, when the ACE inhibitor enalapril was added to the treatment, there was a significant reduction in RIDED, RVAWT, and an increase in the 'a' wave amplitude, with a significant improvement in GFR. A comparison between both groups showed that the increase in GFR and decrease in RVIDED were greater in the enalapril group than in the controls. The amplitude increase of the 'a' wave was also greater in the enalapril group. Therefore, enalapril appears to be valuable in chronic cor-pulmonale, where it reduces pulmonary hypertension and thus right ventricular post-load load. It also reduces renal vascular resistance by increasing renal blood flow, thereby improving GFR.",0,0

2210,9284842,Calcium channel blockers: an evidence-based review.,,"Waters, D","Calcium channel blockers are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, but their appropriate therapeutic role is controversial. However, drugs from this class have been evaluated in many controlled clinical trials of adequate size and duration in different patient populations. While many important questions remain unanswered, these trials have clarified when and how these drugs should be used. Overall, the benefits of calcium channel blockers in controlling angina and hypertension are much more clearly documented than their long-term effects on more difficult endpoints such as mortality. Such long-term data are sorely needed, especially for hypertension. An increased risk with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers has been clearly demonstrated in several studies in patients with coronary disease. In coronary patients with heart failure, the harmful effects of nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil outweigh any potential benefits. Long-acting formulations and newer calcium channel blockers may not share all the side effects of older drugs in this class; however, their long-term safety has not yet been documented. An understanding of the limitations of calcium channel blockers based on clinical trial evidence often leads practitioners to choose a drug from another class for which efficacy has been clearly demonstrated.",0,0

These last parameters suggest a parasympathomimetic effect for additional spironolactone. Spironolactone significantly reduced heart rate (prolonged RR interval), especially during dawn hours (6am to 9am hours). In this unstable study, it was not possible to provide a detailed diary assessment of the effect of spironolactone on heart rate variability, but preliminary data suggest that there may be an interaction with the autonomic nervous system that changes over time; These are the first human data to show that the use of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone can positively improve time-domain heart rate variability and reduce myocardial collagen turnover, as reflected by the greater reduction in serum procollagen peptide despite concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. The remaining aldosterone after ACE inhibitor therapy may therefore have a role in promoting arrhythmia and cardiac death by two mechanisms.

Although specific receptor blockade with losartan has certain theoretical advantages over non-specific ACE inhibition, definitive demonstration of comparable effects in patients with congestive heart failure is lacking. A double-blind, multicenter, randomized, parallel, controlled study of enalapril was conducted in 116 patients with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classes II to IV) and left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 45% previously treated with stable doses. . With or without ACE inhibitors and diuretic agents, concomitant digitalis and other vasodilators. After the initial exercise period, open-label ACE inhibitors were discontinued and patients were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of losartan treatment, 25 mg/day (n = 38); losartan, 50 mg/day (n = 40); or enalapril, 20 mg/day (n = 38). Drug efficacy was assessed by changes in maximum treadmill exercise time (using a modified Naughton protocol), 6-minute walk test, left ventricular ejection fraction, and dyspnea-fatigue index. Safety was measured by the incidence of adverse experiences in the clinical and laboratory; Treadmill exercise time and 6-minute walk test were not significantly changed after replacement of ACE inhibitor therapy with losartan. Similarly, no significant change was observed in either the dyspnea-fatigue index or left ventricular ejection fraction at the end of the double-blind period from baseline; Losartan was generally well tolerated and comparable to enalapril in terms of exercise tolerance in this short-term (12-week) study in patients with heart failure.

Blood pressure (BP) was assessed at 10-minute intervals for 6 hours after administration. After 6 hours, the blood pressure reductions induced by these drugs were still significantly lower than baseline placebo values. The hypotensive effect of nifedipine-capsules was established more rapidly than captopril in both white and black patients and nifedipine-retard in black patients. The overall hypotensive effect of nifedipine-capsules was similar to captopril in white patients, but significantly more pronounced than captopril and nifedipine-retard in black patients, considering the area under the curve for BP values during 6 hours of treatment. In white patients, similar maximum blood pressure reductions (mean ± sem) were achieved with nifedipine-capsules (71+/-4/52+/-4 mm Hg) and captopril (69+/-4/50+/-3). mmHg). In black patients, the maximum blood pressure reduction of nifedipine capsules (70+/-4/52+/-4 mm Hg) was greater than captopril (48+/-4/32+/-3) (P < 0.02) mm Hg) but not that of nifedipine retard. similar (71+/-4/49+/-4 mm Hg). However, unlike nifedipine-capsules and captopril, nifedipine-retard caused a slower decrease in BP. The time for the greatest reduction in blood pressure of both nifedipine-capsules and captopril occurred within the first 2 hours, while it occurred only 4 to 6 hours after administration with nifedipine-retard. Fewer patients reported nifedipine retarding side effects compared to the other two preparations. We concluded that a single dose of captopril and nifedipine reduced BP by at least 6 hours in both white and black patients with hypertensive crisis, but nifedipine was more potent than captopril in black patients. The slow-release form of nifedipine-retardant effectively and safely lowers blood pressure while achieving a sufficiently rapid effect without the critical rapid blood pressure drops that occur with nifedipine-capsules.",0,0

Elevated insulin/glucose ratios (IGR), suggestive of insulin resistance, were found in half of our patients. Obese patients with hyperinsulinemic and normoinsulinemic hypertension had comparable fasting glucose and DHEA-S concentrations and comparable blood pressure (BP) levels. Thus, no relationship was found between fasting insulin and DHEA-S levels. Fasting hyperinsulinemia was found in only half of obese patients with hypertension; this suggests that not all obese patients with hypertension are at the same high cardiovascular risk. Short-term treatment with captopril, prazosin, verapamil, atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) reduced BP; greater BP reduction was observed with drugs with vasodilator effects. Captopril, prazosin, and verapamil reduced fasting insulin levels, while atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide did not. Older drugs reduced fasting insulin levels that were within the normal range or in the hyperinsulinemic range. None of the drug treatments produced significant increases in serum DHEA-S concentrations, although some did significantly reduce fasting insulin levels. No correlation was observed between insulin and DHEA-S levels, neither at baseline nor at the end of antihypertensive therapy.

However, studies in rats have shown that correction of anemia with EPO can affect the progression of renal dysfunction. However, the effect of EPO on residual kidney function in humans is controversial. Therefore, we investigated whether long-term administration of EPO to predialysis patients affects residual kidney function. Anemic patients in the predialysis stage with serum creatinine (Cr) concentrations ranging from 2 to 4 (mean 2.9) mg/dl and hematocrit (Ht) below 30% were randomly assigned to two groups of untreated anemic patients. EPO (group I, untreated anemic controls, n = 31) and EPO-treated anemic patients (group II, treated anemias, n = 42). Patients with non-severe or moderate anemia (Ht > 30%) with a Cr value ranging from 2 to 4 (mean 2.6) mg/dl were also included as nonanemic controls (group III, untreated nonanemic controls, n = 35). Blood pressure was controlled equally between the three groups with combined treatment with calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. All patients were kept on a strict low protein (0.6 g/kg/day) and low salt (7 g/day) diet. The degree of control of dietary protein and blood pressure and the frequency of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor administration were comparable between the three groups. The primary endpoint for each patient was doubling of baseline Cr, which gives cumulative kidney survival rates plotted against time. Ht increased significantly in group II (n = 42, p < 0.001) from 27.0+/-2.3% to 32.1%+/-3.2% with a weekly increase rate of 0.4%+/-0.06%. However, from 27.9%+/-1.8% to 25.3%+/--1.9% in group I (n = 31, p < 0.001) and from 35.9%+/-3.5% in group III (n = 35) Dropped to 32.2+/-3.9. , p < 0.001).

However, there was no difference in renal survival rate between groups II and III (p = 0.3111). The better survival rate achieved in group II can be attributed to the better survival rate in nondiabetic patients in this group. This study suggests that anemia per se is a factor in the progression of end-stage renal disease and that reversal of anemia by EPO may delay the progression of renal failure provided blood pressure is controlled, especially in non-diabetic patients.

ACEIs are particularly indicated for the management of patients with congestive heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and patients with diabetic nephropathy, particularly those with Type I diabetes. Theoretically, AII receptor antagonists would be equally effective for these indications and randomized trials are currently underway to demonstrate this. Specific indications for calcium antagonists in the treatment of hypertension include angina pectoris and non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and rapid ventricular rapid atrial fibrillation. Isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly is a specific indication for long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, although diuretics are preferred. Calcium antagonists have been particularly effective in the management of cyclosporine-induced hypertension. They are contraindicated in CHF due to systolic dysfunction and in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.

2243,9360001,Low-dose reserpine/thiazide combination in first-line treatment of hypertension: efficacy and safety compared to an ACE inhibitor.,,"Griebenow, R; Pittrow, D B; Weidinger, G; Mueller, E; Mutschler, E; Welzel, D","The concept of initiating mild-to-moderate hypertension treatment with a low-dose combination of reserpine and thiazide clopamide compared to monotherapy with an ACE inhibitor was investigated. A total of 127 outpatients with diastolic blood pressures between 100 and 114 mmHg were randomized into this double-blind, parallel group study. After a 2-week washout period and a subsequent 2-week placebo acclimation period, they were allocated to once-daily treatment with either 0.1 mg reserpine plus 5 mg clopamide (R/C) or 5 mg enalapril. If diastolic blood pressure did not return to normal after 3 weeks of treatment (ie DBP < 90 mmHg), the dosage was doubled from week 4 to week 6. Primary efficacy variables, mean sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure (DBP/SBP) after 3 weeks of treatment. Secondary variables included change in DBP and SBP after 6 weeks of treatment, BP normalization rates at weeks 3 and 6, and, regarding tolerability, adverse event rates after 6 weeks of treatment. A therapeutic analysis was performed. The reserpine/clopamide and enalapril groups did not differ by demographic and baseline characteristics (mean age 57 or 58 years, 63% or 56% men, respectively; mean SBP/DBP = 156 mmHg /104 mmHg after a 2-week placebo period in both groups) . After 3 weeks of treatment with one capsule daily, the mean SBP/DBP reduction from baseline (24 hours after the last drug intake) in the R/C combination group was -19.6/ -17.0 mmHg compared to -6.1/ -9.5 mmHg in the enalapril group. (between groups comparison: 2p < 0.01 for both parameters). Normalization rates for DBP (< 90 mmHg) were 64.1% (R/C) and 28.6% (enalapril) (2p < 0.01). Adverse events considered by the investigator to be possibly or definitely drug-related were recorded in 11 patients (17.2%) in the R/C group and in 9 patients (14.3%) in the enalapril group (NS). Two patients in the enalapril group discontinued the study prematurely due to adverse events (cough; skin rash). In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, the combination of low dose reserpine and clopamide once daily is much more effective and well tolerated than enalapril 5-10 mg once daily. These findings suggest that treatment with a combination of different antihypertensives with different modes of action at low doses is a rational alternative to conventional monotherapy in the first-line treatment of hypertension. In addition, the ""old"" reserpine-diuretic regimen still seems to be a rational alternative to ""modern"" monotherapies these days.",0,0
2244,9360002,Lack of effect of short-term administration of lisinopril on left ventricular filling dynamics in hypertensive patients with diastolic dysfunction.,,"Cuspidi, C; Lonati, L; Sampieri, L; Leonetti, G; Muiesan, M L; Agabiti-Rosei, E; Zanchetti, A","Arterial hypertension may be associated with altered left ventricular filling dynamics. The specific purpose of this study was to evaluate whether short-term administration of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in hypertensive patients with altered diastolic pattern resulted in an improvement in left ventricular dynamics as assessed by the echocardio-Doppler technique, independent of effects on left ventricular mass. . In a double-blind crossover study, 39 essential hypertensive patients with a ratio of peak early to peak atrial velocity (E/A) < 1 were randomized to receive lisinopril after a 2-week break-in period without any antihypertensive therapy. (20 mg once daily) and placebo for 4 weeks, respectively. At the end of both the training and treatment periods, blood pressure and heart rate were measured and echocardio-Doppler examination was performed. Echocardio-Doppler assessment was performed both at rest and at the peak of a handgrip test (3 minutes at 30% of maximum strength). Left ventricular dimensions were obtained from two-dimensional guided M-mode monitoring using American Society of Echocardiography criteria. Left ventricular peak filling rates and filling rate integrals were measured using the pulsed Doppler technique. Lisinopril was administered at rest (-13/-9 mmHg - baseline values, p < 0.05; -6/-4 mmHg - placebo values, p < 0.05) and during isometric exercise (-17/ -9 mmHg - baseline period, p < 0.05 -6/-5 mmHg versus placebo, p < 0.05). Lisinopril did not induce any significant changes in left ventricular structure or systolic function. All left ventricular filling parameters (E rate, A rate, E/A ratio) taken into account, both at rest and during isometric exercise, were not significantly different after lisinopril treatment when compared with those obtained at baseline and after placebo administration. This double-blind crossover study demonstrates that the short-term afterload reduction induced by lisinopril does not alter the altered diastolic dynamics in hypertensive patients. Diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle is a complex process influenced by a number of functional and structural factors and apparently cannot be significantly improved by short-term blood pressure reduction with antihypertensive therapy.",0,0

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can reverse LVH by mechanisms independent of their antihypertensive effects. In this study, 18 subjects without arterial hypertension or severe anemia were selected from 170 uremic patients who underwent chronic hemodialysis after meeting the criterion for supranormal left ventricular mass (LVM). Ten subjects agreed to be treated with 2.5 to 20 mg of lisinopril every other day over a 2-year period with annual determinations of LVM by echocardiography and 24-hour blood pressure with a portable device. Eight patients who did not want to undergo treatment served as controls. The mean resting left ventricular mass index (LVMi) of the entire group was 178 +/- 30 g/m2 body surface area (+/- SD) and did not differ between the two subgroups. Lisinopril treatment significantly reduced the LVM in eight out of 10 treated and even completely normalized it in three. The LVM of the untreated group remained unchanged. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 138 +/- 5 mm Hg and 78 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively, in the treated group and 133 +/- 9 mm Hg and 75 +/- 4 mm Hg in the untreated group (P = NS) and remained unchanged over the next 2 years. This study demonstrates that a mild LVH that appears independent of arterial blood pressure load is present in a tight subset of uremic patients. This study also demonstrates that this type of LVH is apparently not progressive. ACE inhibitors given in doses that do not affect blood pressure can reverse this.",0,0

2254,9377617,Co-administration of tamsulosin and three antihypertensive agents in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia: pharmacodynamic effect.,,"Lowe, F C","Tamsulosin, an alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist, has recently been approved to treat patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Tamsulosin is highly selective for prostate receptors with minimal affinity for vascular receptors. Therefore, it should have little effect on blood pressure and should not potentiate the antihypertensive activity of other agents. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate how co-administration of tamsulosin would affect the pharmacodynamic profiles of nifedipine, enalapril and atenolol. Each study included 12 hypertensive men aged 45 years or older whose blood pressure was controlled with maintenance doses of nifedipine (study 1), enalapril (study 2), or atenolol (study 3). All 36 subjects were treated with placebo for 5 days and then randomly assigned to either placebo (control group) or tamsulosin treatment (0.4 mg/day for 7 days, then 0.8 mg/day for 7 days) in addition to continuing their maintenance antihypertensive therapy. . . Blood pressure and pulse rate were monitored over a 24-hour period on study days 4, 11, and 19. Co-administration of tamsulosin in these small studies had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacodynamic effect of nifedipine, enalapril or atenolol; It did not produce clinically significant differences in pulse rate and blood pressure, did not alter electrocardiographic or Holter monitoring results, and did not cause increased side effects. Co-administration of tamsulosin with the three antihypertensive agents studied had a favorable safety profile. Our results in these small studies suggest that no dose adjustment of nifedipine, enalapril or atenolol is required in patients given tamsulosin, which may give tamsulosin an advantage over other alpha-blocking agents used to treat patients with BPH. Now that tamsulosin has been approved in the United States, further clinical use may confirm these findings.",0,0

The study design was double-blind for the first 6 months and then opened. 25-50 mg/day of captopril was added to the treatment of unresponsive patients; Subsequently, patients who did not respond to the combined treatment were switched to any treatment chosen by the treating physicians (free treatment). The occupant's blood pressure, heart rate, and a standard clinical safety profile (electrocardiogram, laboratory tests, adverse events, cardiovascular events, and deaths) were evaluated regularly throughout the study; After 2 years, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced in members of both treatment groups (both based on analysis of variance 16.3/16.6% with verapamil and 16.9/16.2% with chlorthalidone, P < 0 ,0001). The patients to whom we added captopril treatment accounted for 22.6% of the verapamil group and 26.2% of the chlortalidone group; 11.6% and 12.2% of patients in these groups received free treatment, respectively. Normalization of diastolic blood pressure (to < or = 90 mmHg or > or = 10% with a decrease to < or = 95 mmHg) was achieved for 69.3% of the verapamil and 66.9% of the chlorthalidone group. Only members of the verapamil group experienced a reduction in heart rate (5.8%). A decrease in total serum cholesterol (223.6 to 216.9 mg/dl, P < 0.01) and total cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (4.9 to 4.5, P < 0.01) was noted for the verapamil group only, whereas in the Chlortalidone group significantly higher hyperuricemia (plasma urate >7.0 mg/dl; 10.8% vs. 3.9%) and hypokalemia (serum K <3.5 mmol/l; 24.6% vs. 4%) ,4) were observed (P < 0.01, for both versus verapamil).

2256,9384458,Drug therapy in acute porphyria.,,"Gorchein, A","Acute hepatic porphyrias are rare pharmacogenetic diseases inherited as autosomal dominant conditions with low penetration. A genetic defect is a 50% deficiency of an enzyme of both the biosynthetic pathway. Patients may develop 'neurovisceral attacks' including severe abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms and potentially fatal respiratory paralysis. Attacks usually occur after puberty, are much more common in women, and can be triggered by endogenous hormonal changes, diet, alcohol, severe infections, and many medications. Treatment includes analgesia, early hemem administration, and general supportive measures. Since an abdominal emergency can be simulated and inappropriate drugs, including general anesthesia, may exacerbate the crisis, patients are at serious risk of attack at first admission. If there is the slightest doubt about the diagnosis, urine should be tested for elevated porphobilinogen, which is pathognomonic for the acute attack. The genotype of blood relatives of index cases should be determined so that carriers avoid drugs and other precipitants. Some drugs have been identified as safe or unsafe by clinical use, but information on many drugs is not available or is based solely on their properties in rodents or tissue culture systems. Their relevance to the human condition is controversial, but drugs that have been shown to be porphyrinogenic in animal systems should be avoided if a known safe alternative is available. Where it is necessary to use a drug that is not known to be safe, close biochemical and clinical observation can warn of an impending attack.",0,0

2259,9388037,Comparison of the effects of isradipine and enalapril on regional carotid circulation in hypertensive patients with unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis.,,"Akopov, S E; Simonian, N A","This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study aimed to determine the cerebrovascular effects of isradipine and enalapril in patients with moderate hypertension depending on the presence and degree of unilateral stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA). We evaluated carotid vascular resistance using Doppler analysis and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using the 133Xe-clearance technique before and after a single 5 mg oral dose of isradipine, enalapril, or placebo. Its effects were tested randomly and sequentially in 73 patients with essential hypertension who were divided into three groups: no carotid occlusive lesions, moderate (50-75%) and severe (76-99%) unilateral asymptomatic ICA stenosis. There was no difference between these three subgroups in terms of age, gender and antihypertensive effects of the drugs. Three main variants of cerebrovascular drug effects were observed: absence of changes (variant I), reduction in carotid vascular resistance with increase in rCBF and elimination of side-to-side asymmetry (variant II), and increase in carotid vascular resistance with further reduction of rCBF ipsilaterally to ICA stenosis and increased side-to-side asymmetry (variant III). The frequency of variant III was significantly higher in patients with severe ICA stenosis. Enalapril produced variant I of cerebrovascular effects in the majority of patients studied; variant III was observed in only 13% of patients with severe ICA stenosis. Isradipine produced variant I cerebrovascular effects much less frequently than enalapril. For this drug, variant II was most typical in patients without ICA stenosis and those with moderate ICA stenosis. However, in 43.5% of patients with severe ICA stenosis, isradipine caused a decrease in cerebral perfusion. Presumably, the presence of ICA stenosis, especially >75%, increases the risk of cerebrovascular disease with antihypertensive therapy. In patients with severe ICA stenosis, treatment with enalapril appears to be safer than treatment with isradipine.",0,0

2265,9397236,prospective comparison of four study designs used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of drug therapy in the management of hypertension.,,"Levine, M A; Hamet, P; Novosel, S; Jolain, B","The aim of the study was to prospectively compare the impact of study design on drug therapy safety and efficacy data in hypertension management. The main study was a randomized controlled clinical trial of four different prospective study designs used in post-marketing evaluation involving 1008 primary care practices in nine Canadian provinces. Two thousand nine hundred and sixty-four patients with mild to moderate hypertension received an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor daily for 14 weeks in one of four post-marketing studies - one randomized double-blind clinical trial (RCT) (10 to 40 mg fosinopril daily). 5 to 20 mg of enalapril), two structured open-label trials (one with free drugs) of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril per day, or an unstructured open-label trial of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril per day. Patient demographics and baseline, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, reported adverse events, and data quality were recorded as outcome measures. Results showed that RCT patients titrated higher doses of ACE inhibitor than patients in open studies, P < .008; patients in open studies were more likely to receive adjuvant diuretic therapy, P < .008. The reduction in blood pressure for patients in all four studies was similar, with the mean reduction in systolic blood pressure between 18 and 20 mm Hg, and the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure between 11 and 13 mm Hg. Fewer patients in the unstructured open trial reported fewer adverse events than patients in the RCT; A 55% relative reduction in reported adverse events (P < .008) was associated with the unstructured study. In addition, in the unstructured study (17 out of 100 patients), there were fewer drug-related adverse events per patient reported in the other studies (27 to 41 out of 100), P < .008. The physician's preference to round blood pressure measurements to 0 or 5 occurred most frequently in the unstructured open trial (P < .008). In conclusion, despite differences in dose titration and use of adjuvant therapy, the efficacy of antihypertensive drug therapy observed in an RCT may be similar to uncontrolled post-marketing studies. Open trials with scheduled follow-up visits are as effective as RCTs in detecting serious adverse events, but post-marketing studies with unstructured follow-up programs are insufficient to detect drug-related adverse events and have lower quality data.",0,0

We also determined the effects of the interaction of these treatments on neurohormonal activation and the patients' ambient sodium intake on outcomes; In a double-blind, sequential randomized, placebo-controlled study of sustained-release nifedipine (nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system, GITS) 30-120 mg/day, office and 24-hour blood pressure control, plasma 16 to 18 weeks with enalapril 5-30 mg/day renin activity, noradrenaline and adrenaline levels, and 24-hour urine protein and sodium in 46 non-diabetic elderly hypertensive patients in a trial; Both nifedipine GITS and enalapril controlled ambulatory blood pressure throughout the day and at peak effect. Nifedipine GITS also controlled ambulatory blood pressure in the early morning and at night. Nifedipine GITS increased plasma renin activity and noradrenaline by 50% and 20%, respectively, compared to the 150% and 0% change produced by enalapril. Both nifedipine GITS and enalapril reduced proteinuria by 37%. Patients had increased levels or proteinuria proportional to higher ambient sodium intake (r = 0.48; p < 0.01). This effect was emphasized during treatment with nifedipine GITS compared with enalapril; Nifedipine GITS was superior to enalapril in controlling ambulatory blood pressure, but was equivalent in reducing proteinuria (37%). They had different effects on neural activation and duration of action. Elevated protein excretion appears to be associated with increased sodium intake. This was particularly evident during nifedipine XL therapy.",0,0

Adolescents are susceptible to various urinary tract disorders. The key issue in the evaluation of hematuria or proteinuria in adolescents is the presence of accompanying signs of kidney disease. For isolated hematuria or proteinuria, persistence should be demonstrated and a rational assessment should be made. Hypertension in adolescents should be carefully documented and evaluated as serious if present.

ACE inhibitors attenuate the formation of angiotension II and can cause accumulation of kinins. Although the hypotensive effects of many ACE inhibitors last for 24 hours, some patients require more than one dose per day to achieve adequate control. These agents accumulate in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, but it is unclear whether dose adjustment is necessary. ACE inhibitors are effective against mild to moderate hypertension; For severe hypertension, additional anti-hypertensive agents may be necessary. Other conditions in which ACE inhibitors are effective include congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, chronic renal failure, insulin sensitivity, and coronary artery disease. The most common side effect is a persistent, unproductive cough. Angioedema, fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, acute renal failure, and hyperkalemia may also occur. ACE inhibitors may interact with diuretics, lithium, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral hypoglycemic agents, and some other drugs. ACE inhibitor therapy should be initiated with low doses, which can then be slowly adjusted upwards. Most agents have similar costs for lower and higher dosages. The only significant differences between ACE inhibitors are the onset of hypotensive effects, the time to peak effect, and the duration of action. Each formula should contain at least captopril and one intermediate-acting and one long-acting ACE inhibitor.",0,0

There is a need to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new MI treatments in this high-risk population. We evaluated whether treatment with an ACE inhibitor started within 24 hours of symptom onset reduces mortality and morbidity in diabetic patients with acute MI; Retrospective analysis of data from the GISSI-3 study was performed in patients with and without a history of diabetes. Patients with suspected acute MI were randomized to treatment with lisinopril (2.5 to 5 to 10 mg/day) with or without nitroglycerin (5 to 20 microg IV then 10 mg/day), initiated within 24 hours and continued for 6 weeks. The main endpoint was mortality at 6 weeks and the secondary endpoint was the combined assessment of mortality and severe left ventricular dysfunction. Information on diabetes status was available for 18,131 patients (approximately 94% of the total registered population) of 2790 patients with a history of diabetes. Treatment with lisinopril was associated with a reduction in 6-week mortality in diabetic patients (12.4% versus 8.7%; OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.86; 37+ per 1000 patients treated). /-12 lives saved), this effect was significantly (P<.025) higher than that observed in nondiabetic patients.

Angiotensin (AT1) receptor blockers apparently do not share the potentiation of this biosystem. We tested whether losartan improved exercise VO2 in CHF and whether the effect was the same as enalapril. 16 men with CHF and 8 volunteers, all non-smokers and not taking ACE, AT1 receptor or cyclooxygenase inhibitors, were randomized to receive placebo, enalapril (10 mg twice daily), losartan (50 mg/day), each of these 2 drugs. plus aspirin (325 mg/day), aspirin or the same preparations in reverse order, for 3 weeks each with a 3-week washout period between treatments. Pulmonary function and VO2 were assessed at the end of each treatment. In CHF, losartan and enalapril caused a similar improvement in VO2 and exercise tolerance that was not in the controls and was counteracted by aspirin (prostaglandin inhibition) when taken with enalapril and not losartan. While using enalapril, we also found an increase in diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide, which is associated with changes in VO2 and antagonized by aspirin; VO2. Thus, losartan is as effective as enalapril for exercise VO2 and exercise tolerance, although the mechanism appears to differ from activation of a prostaglandin biosystem.

In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once-daily administration of 150 or 300 mg of irbesartan with or without ancillary antihypertensive agents provides effective 24-hour BP control. Irbesartan reduced blood pressure to a similar extent to enalapril and atenolol and significantly more than losartan. The combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide resulted in additive antihypertensive effects. The drug is effective in the elderly and no dose adjustment is required in these patients or those with renal or hepatic impairment. Preliminary studies evaluating the efficacy of irbesartan in patients with heart failure have yielded encouraging results. Irbesartan was very well tolerated and neither the frequency nor the pattern of adverse events differed from those seen in placebo recipients, but headache was significantly more common in the latter. Similarly, the incidence of adverse events in patients receiving both drugs as monotherapy did not differ significantly between irbesartan and enalapril. Headache, upper respiratory tract infection and musculoskeletal pain were the most common complaints. Therefore, irbesartan is an effective treatment for patients with mild to moderate hypertension and has a side-effect profile similar to placebo in clinical studies.

To evaluate the potential role of the renin-angiotensin system in mediating this phenomenon, we treated patients concomitantly with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril; The anti-ischemic activity of organic nitrates was rapidly blunted by the development of nitrate tolerance. The underlying mechanisms are likely multifactorial and may include an increased vasoconstrictor response; Forearm blood flow and vascular resistance were determined using strain gauge plethysmography. Short-term responses to intra-arterial angiotensin II (1, 3, 9, and 27 ng/min) and phenylephrine (an alpha-adrenergic agonist drug, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1 microg/min) were studied in 40 stable male patients. coronary artery disease.

Tight glycemic control can only partially reduce the development and progression of retinopathy. Blood pressure is also a risk factor for microvascular complications. Antihypertensive therapy, particularly with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, may slow the progression of nephropathy, but its effects on retinopathy have not been established. We investigated the effect of lisinopril on retinopathy in type 1 diabetes.; As part of a 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we captured retinal photographs at baseline and at follow-up (24 months) in patients aged 20-59 years at 15 European centers. The patients were not hypertensive and were either normoalbuminuric (85%) or microalbuminuric. Retinopathy was classified on a five-level scale from the photographs (none of them proliferative). The proportion of patients with retinopathy at baseline was 65% (117) in the placebo group and 59% (103) in the lisinopril group (p = 0.2). Patients receiving lisinopril had significantly lower HbA1c at baseline than those receiving placebo (6.9% vs. 7.3 p = 0.05).

2286,9442441,Me too do the drugs justify?,,"Garattini, S","The successful advancement of pharmacology in the treatment of various diseases has led to the development of a strong pharmaceutical industry with an estimated market in excess of $250 billion. So it's understandable that as drug development and marketing becomes big business, it adopts rules common to other commercial areas. This is a potentially dangerous trend because it undermines what should be the main purpose of drug development, namely, to supply active medical agents to the patient with precise and reliable information, at the lowest possible cost, especially when a national health system needs to be provided. medicines to patients with an income too low to pay for them. The giant pharmaceutical market has also triggered a competition among pharmaceutical companies. This means that as soon as a prototype drug becomes available, it follows suitably with several other active compounds. These followers are often referred to as ""me too dope"". Me-too drugs can generally be defined as chemically related to the prototype or other chemical compounds with the same mechanism of action. This increased marketing of their drugs has also been questioned, so pharmaceutical companies justify the development of not-so-innovative drugs. The most common arguments can be summarized as follows: me-too drugs offer an improvement over the effectiveness of the prototype; they show a different side-effect profile; they are effective in prototypical resistant patients; they increase compliance in long-term treatment; they are cheaper than the prototype. The purpose of this article is to review the evidence that confirms these statements, while I give some figures on drugs and provide a few examples.",0,0
2287,9443770,Effects of bisoprolol and captopril on insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in essential hypertension.,,"Dominguez, L J; Barbagallo, M; Jacober, S J; Jacobs, D B; Sowers, J R","It has been reported that angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers have different effects on insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the selective beta-1 blocker bisoprolol and the ACE inhibitor captopril on the cellular insulin action in hypertensive individuals. After washing, 12 mild to moderate essential hypertensives were randomized in a double-blind fashion to bisoprolol 5 mg twice daily or captopril 25 mg twice daily for 8 weeks. Erythrocyte insulin binding and insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase (TK) activity were measured before and after treatment. Both agents significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure (bisoprolol 96.5+/-0.9 to 87.8+/-3.1 mm Hg; captopril 96.5+/-0.9 to 91.5+/-1.8 mm Hg; P < .05). Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin/glucose indices remained unchanged after both treatments, as did lipid profiles. Maximum insulin-stimulated TK activity as assessed by phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate poly-Glu80Tyr20 was significantly higher (P < .05) after bisoprolol treatment compared to placebo (bisoprolol 8.5+/-1.8; captopril), but not after captopril treatment 7.3+ /-1.5; placebo: 6.4+/-1.3 pmol 32P-ATP/fmol bound insulin). However, captopril, but not bisoprolol, increased the sensitivity of receptor TK activity as measured by the half-maximum activity concentration (ED50). Specific insulin binding was not affected by these two agents. Thus, both captopril and bisoprolol may have positive but different effects on TK activity and insulin action at the cellular level.",0,0

Two self-administered, validated questionnaires, the Psychological General Well-Being index and the Subjective Symptom Assessment Profile (SSA-P), were completed at baseline and 6 months later. The lower the DBP achieved, the greater the improvement in well-being (p < 0.05). The improvement in well-being from baseline to 6 months was significant in the target groups < or =80 mmHg (p < 0.01) and < or =85 mmHg (p < 0.05). SSA-P areas, cardiac symptoms, and dizziness improved in all groups, but in male patients, the sex life score deteriorated in the < or =80 and < or =85 mmHg groups. Headaches decreased in all target groups (p < 0.001), while swollen ankles (p < 0.001) and dry cough increased in the < or =80 mmHg group (p < 0.001). More intensive antihypertensive therapy is associated with a slight increase in subjective symptoms, but still with improvements in patients' well-being.",0,0

Patients were randomized to receive either conventional antihypertensive therapy (diuretics and/or beta-blockers) or captopril-based therapy. A prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint evaluation (PROBE) study design is used to compare these two therapeutic regimens for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The rationale for the CAPPP Study is the multiple observations of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition on intermediate endpoints such as insulin sensitivity, serum lipoproteins, left ventricular hypertrophy, and renal function compared with diuretics and beta-blockers. Captopril has been shown to be significantly effective in the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction as well as congestive heart failure. The hypothesis is that these differences may result in better risk reduction when ACE inhibitors are used to treat hypertension. This article describes baseline data and changes in blood pressure during the first year in the total cohort. During the first year, the mean blood pressure decreased by 11/8 mm Hg. A number of sub-studies were conducted in the CAPPP Study. In one of these, insulin sensitivity was compared in a subset of patients using the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. Another substudy sequenced the ACE gene and discovered some new polymorphisms. A few other sub-studies are in progress or in the planning stages. The main results of the CAPPP Study should be available by mid-1998. Some of the intended analyzes of the final results and other planned sub-studies are briefly described here.",0,0

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition appears to have a specific reno-protective role in diabetic nephropathy, possibly by reducing intraglomerular pressure. The acute effects of ACE inhibition on renal hemodynamics in normotensive, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) have not been previously reported. Using 51Cr EDTA and 125I Hippuran, we measured simultaneous glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) in 29 (4 females) subjects with a mean age of 52 years (range 27-70). Apertures have been corrected to 1.73 m(-2). All patients were normotensive (blood pressure <75th centile for age and sex), newly diagnosed (<30 days), not taking antihypertensive or hypoglycemic medication. Subjects were randomized (double-blind) to receive the ACE inhibitor trandolapril 4 mg day(-1) (H) (hypotensive dose), trandolapril 0.5 mg day(-1)(L) (non-hypotensive dose) or placebo (P). Left. Renal hemodynamics was re-measured over 10 days. Baseline GFR, RPF, and filtration fraction (FF) for all subjects were 97%+/-21 ml min(-1) mean+/-SD, 439±120 ml min(-1) and 22.3%+/-2.9%, respectively. Glomerular hyperfiltration (GFR> 120 ml min[-1]) was demonstrated in only 3 subjects (10.3%). In group H, mean arterial pressure (103+/-8 vs 93+/-9 mmHg, p < 0.001) and FF (23.8+/-2.3 vs 20.0+/-4.0%, p = 0.03) decreased, while RPF increased (376 + /-111 vs. 426+/-60 ml min(-1), p = 0.02), there was no significant change in GFR. There were no significant changes in mean arterial pressure, GFR, RPF, or FF in groups P and L. These studies demonstrate that normal renal autoregulation occurs in newly diagnosed normotensive NIDDM patients and that glomerular hyperfiltration is uncommon.",0,0

The study design was a parallel, two-period, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover design in which 11 subjects received perindopril and 10 subjects received amlodipine during the familiarization phase. Addition of amlodipine to perindopril did not affect ambulatory blood pressure, whereas addition of perindopril to amlodipine reduced both systolic (P = 0.027) and diastolic (P = 0.049) ambulatory blood pressure. In contrast, the opposite result was obtained for clinical BP in the trough, so the addition of amlodipine to perindopril reduced erectile systolic BP (P = 0.036) and both supine and erect diastolic BP (P = 0.038), while adding perindopril to amlodipine had the effect of without. Addition of perindopril to amlodipine decreased serum ACE by 72% and increased PRA by twofold, without change in plasma levels of Ang II, aldosterone, or alpha-h ANP. Addition of amlodipine to perindopril increased plasma aldosterone 1.7-fold but did not affect serum ACE, PRA, Ang II, or alpha-h ANP. These interactions between perindopril and amlodipine may be conditioned by the different conditions of BP measurement (ambulatory and clinical) as well as the specific effects of the initial therapy.",0,0

The trial design was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 12-week treatment phase followed by a 36-week open-label phase. A total of 891 patients with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) between 95 and 115 mm Hg were randomly assigned to enalapril 5 mg, diltiazem ER 120 mg, diltiazem ER 180 mg, enalapril 5 mg/diltiazem ER 120 mg (E5/D120). , enalapril 5 mg/ diltiazem ER 180 mg (E5/D180) or placebo. In the open-label phase, 562 patients received the fixed combination, which was titrated as needed to control SiDBP < 90 mm Hg. Efficacy was determined by sitting (24 +/- 2 hours post-dose) blood pressure measurements at week 12 and at the end of the open-label portion of the study. Safety was evaluated based on patient symptoms, clinical laboratories, and electrocardiograms (ECG). E5/D120 and E5/D180 significantly reduced SiDBP (-7.6 and -8.3 mm Hg, respectively; P < .05) compared to their monotherapy. E5/D120 and E5/D180 significantly reduced sitting systolic blood pressure (-7.9 and -9.0, respectively; P < .05) compared to either diltiazem ER monotherapy. All active treatments significantly reduced SiDBP and SiSBP compared to placebo. E/D effectively lowered SiDBP and SiSBP during open label extension. There was no significant difference between treatment groups for the overall incidence of adverse events. The most common drug-related side effects are headache, edema/swelling, dizziness, asthenia/fatigue, cough, rash, and impotence. The frequency of events for the combinations was similar to that seen for monotherapies. Fixed E/D combinations were generally well tolerated, and the blood pressure lowering effect was enhanced in patients with stage I to III hypertension compared with the individual components.",0,0

After a placebo break-in period of four to six weeks, patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four oral doses of bosentan (100, 500, or 1000 mg once daily or 1000 mg twice daily), placebo, or the angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg once daily). for four weeks. Blood pressure was measured before and after treatment; Compared to placebo, bosentan resulted in a significant reduction in diastolic pressure with a daily dose of 500 or 2000 mg (an absolute 5.7 mm Hg reduction at each dose), similar to the reduction with enalapril (5.8 mm Hg). There was no significant change in heart rate. Bosentan did not result in activation of the sympathetic nervous system (as determined by measurement of plasma norepinephrine level) or the renin-angiotensin system (as determined by measurements of plasma renin activity and angiotensin II levels); Bosentan, an endothelin-receptor antagonist, significantly lowered blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension, suggesting that endothelin may contribute to the elevation of blood pressure in such patients.

Demographic and clinical information was obtained for each patient, and each coronary care unit was classified according to patient volume, level of technology, and wide geographic area. A multivariate logistic regression was performed using thrombolytic therapy as the dependent variable and predefined clinical and structural variables as independent variables; The most important factor in administering thrombolytic therapy was less than 6 hours from symptom onset to hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] 14.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.3 to 16.0).

After a 2-week placebo adjustment period, hypertensive patients were treated with trandolapril 2 mg once daily or perindopril 4 mg once daily for 4 weeks in a double-blind design. Then placebo was administered for 1 week. Three periods of 1-week home measured blood pressure (SMBP) were programmed: the end of the placebo break-in period, the end of the treatment period, and the final placebo withdrawal period. Three consecutive measurements were requested each day, both in the evening and in the morning. Return to individual baseline BP was studied in the subgroup of patients who responded to treatment (evening diastolic SMBP decrease > or =6 mm Hg). The mean post-drug DBP reduction (residual effect) ratio (R) to DBP reduction (full effect) on evening drug was used to examine return to baseline. Patients who showed less than the median of this ratio were called Reversers, others were called Non-Reversers. One hundred and nineteen patients entered the analysis. Over the treatment period, mean SMBP decreased significantly from 150 +/- 14/97 +/- 7 mm Hg to 139 +/- 15/91 +/- 9 mm Hg (all P < .001). The level of BP on the drug was similar in the evening in the two treatment groups. However, both systolic and diastolic morning SMBP levels were significantly lower in the trandolapril group. After discontinuation of the drug, mean BP increased significantly to 144 +/- 14/94 +/- 9 mm Hg (all P = .01), but remained lower than baseline BP values (P = .003 and P = . .002) for DBP. Post-drug BP level was significantly lower in the trandolapril group than in the perindopril group. Seventy-four patients responded to treatment. In this subgroup, the median R ratio used to analyze return to baseline after drug discontinuation was 44%. Non-Converters were characterized by sustained BP reduction on a drug compared to Transducers. Therefore, we conclude that discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy is accompanied by a rapid increase in BP (within 48 hours) followed by a 5-day plateau in BP that is less than baseline. Those who returned to baseline after drug discontinuation were more likely to not be adequately controlled during treatment, particularly in the morning. The longer duration of action of trandolapril was associated with a lower BP level both in the morning during the active treatment phase and in the 1-week post-treatment phase.",0,0

Incidence, prevention and management.",,"Vleeming, W; van Amsterdam, J G; Stricker, B H; de Wildt, D J","Available information on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema from 1980 to 1997 and its underlying mechanisms are summarized and discussed. The incidence of angioedema is low (0.1 to 0.2%) but can be considered a potentially life-threatening side effect of ACE inhibitor therapy. This adverse effect of ACE inhibitors, regardless of their chemical makeup, can occur early in treatment as well as after prolonged exposure for up to several years. The estimated incidence has been rather underestimated. The actual incidence may be much higher due to underrecognition of angioedema, often as a result of its late onset in combination with long-term therapy. Also, a spontaneous reporting bias may contribute to a truly higher incidence of this phenomenon. The incidence may be even higher (up to 3 times) in some risk groups, such as black Americans. Treatment includes immediate discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor and acute symptomatic supportive therapy, followed by immediate (and prolonged) alternative therapy with other classes of drugs to manage hypertension and/or heart failure. Preclinical and clinical studies to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema have not reached conclusive results. It has been suggested that immunological processes and various mediator systems (bradykinin, histamine, substance P and prostaglandins) are involved in the pathogenesis of angioedema. The majority of all reports reviewed suggest an association between ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema and increased (tissue) bradykinin levels. However, conclusive evidence for a role for bradykinin in angioedema has not been found, and a specific role for bradykinin seems unlikely. So far, no conclusive evidence for an immune-mediated pathogenesis has been found. In addition, it has been suggested that ACE gene polymorphism and some enzyme deficiencies play a role in ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. Progress in pharmacogenetic and molecular biological research should shed more light on a possible genetic component in the pathogenesis of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema.",0,0

The specificity of the adverse effect was confirmed by a blinded, double-cross design protocol in which subjects were restarted with either lisinopril or placebo. The frequencies of ACE D and I alleles in 99 case subjects and 70 control subjects thus selected (who failed to develop cough on re-administration with an ACE inhibitor) were 0.56 and 0.44 (cases) and 0.56 and 0.44 (controls), respectively; The frequencies for the chymase A and B alleles (absence/presence of the BstXI region) were 0.56 and 0.44 (cases) and 0.46 and 0.54 (controls), respectively; The frequencies for the B2-bradykinin receptor + and - alleles (presence/absence of a 21 to 29 non-nucleotide sequence) were 0.52 and 0.48 (cases) and 0.53 and 0.47 (controls), respectively.

Italian Microalbuminuria Working Group at IDDM.,,"Crepaldi, G; Carta, Q; Deferrari, G; Mangili, R; Navalesi, R; Santeusanio, F; Spalluto, A; Vanasia, A; Villa, G M; Nosadini, R","Intervention trials for kidney function in IDDM patients with microalbuminuria (MA) should adopt the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as an outcome measure. However, normotensive IDDM patients with MA show no change in GFR over a 10-year follow-up period. Therefore, in this study, we used the cumulative incidence of progression from MA to albuminuria (albumin excretion rate [AER] > 200 micrograms/min) as the primary endpoint, with annual increase in AER 50% above baseline. secondary endpoint of kidney function; Ninety-two normotensive IDDM patients received double-blind, double-blind therapy with either lisinopril or slow-release nifedipine compared to placebo. During the 3-year follow-up period, ten patients discontinued the study; During the 3-year follow-up period, 7 (20.6%) of 34 placebo-treated patients, 2 (6.3%) of 32 lisinopril-treated patients, and 2 (7.7%) of 26 nifedipine-treated patients developed clinical albuminuria ( Fisher's) advanced. definitive test, P < 0.03). Time to event analysis showed a 58.1% (95% CI 27.8-68.4%) and a 62.5% (95% CI 32.5-73.4) reduction in the risk of progression to macroalbuminuria in 32 patients (P < 0.02) who received lisinopril. after adjusting for mean blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, and baseline AER, in 26 patients receiving nifedipine (P < 0.02) compared to 34 patients receiving placebo. Baseline AER was 71 micrograms/min (range: 20.7-187.3) in progressing and 73 microgram/min (range: 20.2-174.1) in non-progressors (NS). The percentage of patients with >50% annual increase in AER above baseline was significantly lower in the lisinopril group (13 of 32, 40.6%, P < 0.02), but not in the nifedipine group (15 of 26, 57.7%) , relative to the placebo group (23/34, 67.6%). The lisinopril group had significantly lower blood pressure values at follow-up than the nifedipine (P < 0.05) or placebo (P < 0.01) group; Our data show that both lisinopril and nifedipine are effective in delaying the occurrence of macroalbuminuria in normotensive IDDM patients with MA. As overt proteinuria strongly predicts end-stage renal disease, both treatments seem to be able to prevent such a complication in normotensive IDDM patients with MA. However, lisinopril appears to be more potent in slowing the course of nephropathy.",0,0

After 6 weeks of treatment, the daily dose was doubled in patients with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) > or = 90 mm Hg; Patients with essential hypertension with a mean trough SiDBP of 95-115 mm Hg after the placebo baseline were randomized to losartan (N = 192) or captopril (N = 204) treatment; The primary efficacy variable was the mean change in trough SiDBP from baseline to Week 12. Safety was assessed by recording spontaneously reported or observed adverse experiences and clinical laboratory measurements; After 12 weeks, both treatments produced clinically significant reductions in trough SiDBP and sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP). These mean reductions (SiDBP, SiSBP) were significantly greater in the losartan group (-11.5 and -15.4 mm Hg, respectively) than the captopril group (-9.3 and -12.2 mm Hg, respectively) (for diastolic and p p = 0.010). = 0.023 for systolic). The percentage of patients with an excellent (minimum SiDBP < 90 mm Hg) or good (minimum SiDBP > 90 mm Hg, > or = 10 mm Hg reduction) antihypertensive response to losartan and captopril treatment at Week 12 was comparable (60.0%) and respectively 54.7%). The percentage of patients reporting clinical adverse experiences considered drug-related by the investigator was 13% in the captopril group and 10% in the losartan group. The incidence of drug-induced cough was 2.6% in the losartan group and 4.4% in the captopril group; Administration of 50 to 100 mg losartan once daily is an effective treatment for patients with essential mild to moderate hypertension.

The following case illustrates the clinical dangers of polypharmacy and serves as a point for critical discussion; MEDLINE has been searched using the keyword ""polypharmacy"" since 1994. A polypharmacy case report is described and a new protocol for polypharmacy management is proposed; Polypharmacy can lead to unnecessary expenses, waste of time and embarrassment for the patient, and confusion and mismanagement for the physician. The literature highlights the controversy surrounding the definition of polypharmacy and reflects the significant morbidity and expense associated with polypharmacy. Finally, the SAIL protocol demonstrates that physicians must keep in mind simplicity, side effects, indications, and a precise list of all medications to properly manage a patient's medication regimen. Polypharmacy is associated with morbidity and iatrogenic complications. The SAIL protocol can be a useful tool in the management of this asset. More research is needed on the prevalence, complications and management of polypharmacy.",0,0

Eighteen patients were randomized to receive each of the four different drugs for 8 weeks in a double-blind, crossover fashion. ABPM was performed at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment with these drugs. A washout period of 2 to 3 weeks occurred both at baseline and between each of the four drugs. Three patients were excluded from statistical analysis because of ABPM's technical problems. Atenolol, isradipine SRO, and spirapril significantly reduced mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure (P < .01), while HCTZ did not. Mean 24-hour diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly after all four drugs: 12 (SD+/-14) mm Hg with atenolol, 7 (SD+/-10) mm Hg with isradipine SRO, 3 mm Hg (SD+/-14) with 6 (SD+/-15) mm Hg (P < .01) with HCTZ and spirapril. None of the overnight drugs significantly lowered mean diastolic or systolic blood pressure. According to the 24-hour blood pressure curve, the effect of these four drugs was not similar over the entire measurement period. Atenolol and spirapril lost their antihypertensive effect in the early morning hours. The antihypertensive effect of HCTZ varied significantly from hour to hour. No drug had a trough/peak ratio of >0.50. A negative correlation was observed between apnea duration and 24-hour mean systolic (r = -0.604, P = NS) and mean systolic nighttime blood pressure change (r = -0.590, P = NS).

Sitting diastolic blood pressure was lowered 4.5 mm Hg, 4.3 mm Hg and 8.1 mm Hg more in the trandolapril, verapamil SR and combination groups compared to placebo, respectively. In the combination group, sitting diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by 3.6 mm Hg more than in the trandolapril group and 3.8 mm Hg more than in the verapamil SR group (P < .01). An analysis of the trough-to-peak ratio for sitting diastolic blood pressure revealed values of 0.75 and 0.67 for the 4 mg trandolapril and combination groups at the endpoint, respectively.

Changes in plasma BNP levels in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have not been well studied. This study was designed to examine the effects of early angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy on plasma BNP levels in patients with acute myocardial infarction; We measured plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide for 2 weeks in 30 patients with acute myocardial infarction who were randomly given imidapril (n=15) or placebo (n=15) immediately after admission. Plasma BNP levels increased and reached a peak of 192 +/- 28 pg/ML 16 hours after administration; thereafter, levels decreased and then increased again, forming a second peak of 217 +/- 38 pg/ML on day five (biphasic model). On the other hand, plasma BNP levels in the imidapril group (monophasic pattern) increased 16 hours after admission to a peak of 190 +/- 22 pg/ML and then decreased 2 days after admission until the second week (monophasic pattern). Left ventricular ejection fraction measured at week 2 was significantly higher in the imidapril group than in the control group (62.2 +/- 1.1% vs 51.2% +/- 3.6%, P < .01); It was concluded that plasma BNP levels followed a monophasic pattern after placebo, whereas a biphasic pattern after placebo and plasma BNP levels were a marker of ventricular dysfunction in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.",0,0

Long-Term Use of Enalapril/Diltiazem ER in the Stage 3-4 Hypertension Group.,,"Chrysant, S G; Gavras, H; Niederman, A L; Marbury, T C; Goldstein, R","The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers as monotherapies and in combination is common in the treatment of hypertension. Clinical studies have documented an increase in blood pressure reduction when these agents are combined compared to individual agents in short-term studies. In this study, 93 patients with stage 3-4 essential hypertension who successfully completed a short-term double-blind study participated in the 40-week open-label treatment phase. Patients were maintained at previous doses of enalapril/diltiazem ER (E/D) with or without additional antihypertensive drugs. Medication doses for blood pressure control can be adjusted as needed. Of the 93 patients, 68% were male and 82% were white; They were an average of 52.7 years old and had a mean sitting blood pressure (SiBP) of 167/111 mmHg at baseline. Use of E/D alone (n = 14) decreased mean SiBP by 14.5/14.4 mmHg from baseline, while use of E/D in combination with other agents (n = 79) decreased mean SiBP by 27/20.5 mmHg from baseline.

The design was a placebo-controlled, randomized, two-way crossover, double-blind study, meaning each patient served as his or her own control. Intracellular erythrocyte sodium and potassium content was measured by flame photomometry. The increase in intracellular sodium concentration for 1 hour of incubation of whole blood with ouabain (compared to no-ouabain) at 37°C was measured to determine the rate of active sodium efflux. 24-hour blood pressure was recorded with Space-lab equipment (SL 90202) before and after salt loading. Left ventricular morphology was assessed by echocardiography and minimal vascular resistance of the hand vascular bed was assessed by water plethysmography at baseline and 4 years later in enalapril. Four years of enalapril therapy resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure, left ventricular mass, and minimal vascular resistance. During the 4-day salt load, mean 24-hour blood pressure increased significantly to 129+/-3/85+/-2 mmHg compared to 124+/-2/82+/-2 mmHg during placebo treatment (p= 0.025). The change in MAP (delta) during high salt intake showed a negative correlation with the delta-sodium flow rate constant (r=-0.65, p=0.047). No significant correlation was found between the blood pressure response to salt load and structural cardiovascular changes. In conclusion, in hypertensive patients on chronic enalapril therapy, short-term oral salt loading caused an increase in blood pressure, which was associated with cellular sodium transport but not with structural cardiovascular changes.",0,0

The hypercontractile state of the heart can be alleviated by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor by suppressing the release of CA from the sympathetic nerve ending. Thus, an ACE inhibitor may have a positive effect on the prevention of NMS. In this study, 24 elderly subjects with reproducible NMS induced by the head-up tilt test (HUT) were randomized and divided into double-blind, placebo, and ACE-inhibitor groups. Plasma CA concentration [norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E)] was measured during HUT, and the effects of enalapril on NMS were observed in both groups. Before administration of enalapril, plasma CA concentrations were significantly increased during HUT compared to those in the supine position; In contrast, administration of enalapril (10 mg/day) for .1 year prevented plasma CA increased concentration and prevented syncope in all 12 patients (p < 0.05); however, placebo had no effect on plasma CA concentrations and only two of 12 patients resolved syncope after placebo was administered. From this study, we concluded that enalapril may prevent NMS in patients, possibly due to its role in inhibiting CA release from sympathetic nerve endings.",0,0

No large multicenter studies of AMI have so far provided information on LV thrombosis. The protocol of the GISSI-3 trial included the search for the presence of LV thrombosis in patients in 200 coronary care units that did not specifically focus on LV thrombosis. We reviewed the GISSI-3 database results from 8,326 patients at low to moderate risk for LV thrombus for whom a preejaculate echocardiogram (9 +/- 5 days) was available. LV thrombosis was found in 427 patients (5.1%): 292 of 2,544 patients (11.5%) with anterior AMI and 135 (2.3%) of 5,782 patients with AMI at other sites (p < 0.0001).

Oral beta-blocker therapy with or without early intravenous beta-blocker administration in patients with anterior AMI does not affect the occurrence of LV thrombosis. The rate of LV thrombosis was similar in patients treated or not treated with nitrates and lisinopril, both in the total population and in patients with anterior and non-anterior AMI. In conclusion, in the GISSI-3 population at low to moderate risk for LV thrombus, the highest rate of occurrence of LV thrombosis was found in patients with anterior AMI and ejection fraction < 40%.

Interpreting the results of these studies and applying them to clinical practice requires an understanding of study design limitations, conflicting results, and limitations in estimating study findings to other dosage strengths, formulations, or agents within the calcium channel antagonist class. A review and critique of these studies provides background information on the controversial issue of using calcium channel antagonists for the treatment of hypertension. Despite the limitations of these studies, clinicians may wish to select other classes of agents as first-line therapy, including diuretics and beta-blockers, until the morbidity and mortality effects associated with the use of calcium channel antagonists are clearly known.",0,0
2342,9556832,Medical treatment of migraine: from mechanisms of action to contraindications.,,"Higelin, F; Annoni, J M","Management of migraine patients with or without aura should include appropriate medications to treat the attack and long-term preventive therapy, especially if the frequency of attacks is greater than 2-4 per month. In both cases, the choice of treatment depends on its effectiveness and side effects. With regard to acute drug therapy, group studies do not suggest that ergot derivatives and sumatriptan are superior to simple analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, especially when a prokinetic agent is added. These new agents are indicated for severe attacks refractory to more conventional therapy. Chronic drug abuse can cause drug-induced or rebound headaches. With regard to long-term prophylaxis, group studies show that calcium antagonists and drugs that affect 5-HT are superior to beta-blocking agents in terms of attack frequency, but have very frequent side effects (weight gain and sleepiness). Interesting preliminary results have also been reported with valproate and enalapril, which will be confirmed by controlled studies. Finally, the patient's comorbidities (cardiovascular diseases, asthma, diabetes, etc.) should be considered in the selection of drugs.",0,0

Treatment and practice assignments were double-blind. Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure was monitored before and after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. During chronic treatment, renal hemodynamics were determined on the first day of drug administration and 12 and 24 hours after the last dose. Administration of each antihypertensive agent resulted in renal vasodilation without significant change in glomerular filtration rate. However, the time course looked different: irbesartan showed no significant acute effect 4 hours after the first dose, but a renal vasodilatory response was found 12 and 24 hours post-dose during chronic administration; enalapril was effective acutely and at 12 hours post-dose, but no residual effects were found 24 hours post-dose. Both antihypertensive agents effectively lowered mean ambulatory blood pressure with no significant difference between treatments or between administration schedules (morning and evening); Irbesartan and enalapril have comparable effects on blood pressure and renal hemodynamics in hypertensive patients with normal renal function. However, the time profiles of renal effects appear to be different, which may be important for long-term renoprotective effects.",0,0

Whether antihypertensive therapy can normalize wall hypertrophy of the conducting arteries remains to be determined.; Seventy-seven elderly hypertensive patients were randomized to receive 9 months of double-blind therapy with a combination of perindopril (2 to 8 mg/day) or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 50 mg/day) plus amiloride (1.25 to 5 mg/day) diuretic. ) after a 1-month placebo washout period. If systolic blood pressure remained >160 mm Hg after 5 months, chlorthalidone or atenolol was added, respectively. Arterial variables, including radial artery mass and common carotid artery compliance, were calculated from noninvasive measurements of internal diameter and wall thickness using high-resolution echo monitoring systems at baseline and at 5 and 9 months; During treatment, blood pressure and arterial variables changed at the same rate in both groups. After 9 months of treatment, systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures, and radial artery wall thickness, mass, and thickness/radius ratio were significantly reduced (p < 0.01), while carotid compliance increased (p < 0.001). After 9 months of treatment, reduction in radial artery thickness/radius ratio was significantly associated with reduction in pulse pressure (p < 0.01), while improvement in carotid compliance was associated with reduction in mean arterial pressure (p < 0.01). . In healthy subjects and untreated hypertensive patients, radial artery diameter, wall thickness and thickness-to-radius ratio, and carotid artery compliance did not change significantly over a 9-month observation period; These results show that both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and diuretic combination based therapies can reduce radial artery wall hypertrophy and improve carotid artery compliance in elderly hypertensive patients.",0,0
2345,9562649,Hemodynamic performances in sotalol-treated patients after electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation.,,"Dan, G A; GonÅ£a, A","The negative inotropic effect of nearly all antiarrhythmic drugs represents an important disadvantage of medical therapy, especially in patients with impaired left ventricular function. The aim of this study was to evaluate atrial and ventricular function and exercise capacity in patients with mild heart failure treated with d,l-sotalol after electrical conversion of atrial fibrillation. The study included patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (more than 2 weeks but less than 1 year) and mild heart failure (< or = class II NYHA). All patients had comparable baseline echocardiographic findings and received captopril. After successful cardioversion, patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 treated with sotalol (mean dose 240 mg qd, max. 320 mg) and group 2-- no sotalol. The withdrawal criterion was failure to achieve sinus rhythm. Finally, 17 patients in the study (10 men, 7 women, aged 41-60 years); group 1 consisted of 10 patients and group 2-7 patients. They were evaluated with quantitative echocardiography + Doppler and standard ECG exercise test for less than 1 month but longer than 2 weeks and at 1, 3 and 6 months. When first evaluated (2 weeks-1 month), peak A wave velocity and atrial filling rate were higher in group 2 than in group 1 (37 +/- 10 cm/s vs. 20 +/- 5 cm/sec and 23% +/- 7% vs 13% +/- 5) and group 1 also had a lower exercise tolerance (110 +/- 10 W vs 80 +/- 25 W). There was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2 in terms of left atrial and left ventricular dimensions, ejection fraction and E wave deceleration time. After 1 month, there was no significant difference in Doppler characteristics, echocardiographic parameters and exercise tolerance between the two groups. Group 1 remained at a lower heart rate and had a lower maximum double product (17250 mmHg/min vs. 22100 mmHg/min) corresponding to a lower heart rate. There was no significant change in all characteristics between the two groups at 3 and 6 months. In conclusion, sotalol appears to be a well tolerated antiarrhythmic agent in patients with mild heart failure after conversion of persistent atrial fibrillation. In this setting: 1. Sotalol can reverse the effect of atrial stunning after electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, but this effect is brief. 2. Sotalol has no relevant negative inotropic effects, at least in relation to captopril. 3. Sotalol increases effort capacity.",0,0

We also describe the impact of ACE inhibitor prescriptions, ACE inhibitor dose increases, and non-pharmacological education interventions on readmission survival rates. We hypothesize that care by a cardiologist and higher mean arterial blood pressure at presentation are associated with taking optimal doses of ACE inhibitors. We hypothesize that taking an ACE inhibitor at discharge and increasing the dose of ACE inhibitor at hospitalization are associated with superior survival without readmission; The medical records of patients who were consecutively hospitalized with a major diagnosis of heart failure between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 1993 at an academic medical center were reviewed. Documented instructions and medications prescribed at discharge were summarized. Deaths and readmissions up to 31 December 1994 were defined by the National Death Index and the agency's administrative database, respectively. In 1992 and 1993, 387 patients were discharged from the hospital alive due to heart failure. 18% of patients discharged on enalapril or captopril received doses recommended in heart failure clinical practice guidelines. Patients discharged with a recommended dose of ACE inhibitor were more likely to be African-American and had lower sodium levels and higher mean arterial pressures than patients discharged with lower doses of ACE inhibitors. In survival analyses, an increase in ACE inhibitor dose was associated with improved readmission survival, independent of left ventricular systolic function type. Taking an ACE inhibitor at discharge was also associated with superior readmission survival, whereas non-pharmacological instructional instruction was not associated with improved outcomes; Interventions are needed to improve the frequency with which ACE inhibitors are prescribed at recommended doses to hospitalized patients with heart failure. We conclude that among these patients, taking an ACE inhibitor at discharge and increasing the dose of ACE inhibitor at hospitalization were each associated with measurable effects on readmission survival, whereas provision of currently applied educational instructions was not associated with better outcomes.",0,0

The volume-to-mass ratio (VMR) was calculated and clinical status was documented at each examination time according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) guidelines. The results were compared with the results of a historical sample without ACE inhibitor therapy (n = 31, 10 females, 21 males, 36-75 years) examined in the same manner. LVEDVI and LVESVI increased by 24.9% and 36.6%, respectively, in the first 6 months after infarction in the historical example; 11.0% and 7.8%, respectively, under captopril; and 13.1% and 10.7% under fosinopril, respectively. LVEF decreased 14.9% in the untreated sample, 3.7% under captopril and 5.0% under fosinopril. Infarct weight and LVMM increased by 12.7% and 15.3% without ACE inhibition, 5.7% and 10.1% in captopril-treated patients, and 6.1% and 9.3% in fosinopril-treated patients, respectively. VMR increased 7.4% in the previous sample, 3.5% in the captopril group and 1.8% in the fosinopril group. NYHA clinical status improved 18.2% without ACE inhibition, 42.9% in the captopril group, and 26.3% in the fosinopril group. While the differences between the two ACE inhibitor groups and the reference group were all significant, the differences between the captopril group and the fosinopril group were significant only for the VMR (p < 0.01) and NYHA class (p < 0.05); Both captopril and fosinopril have a comparable positive effect on post-infarction remodeling and clinical status. Lipophilicity and tissue affinity do not appear to play a clinically important role in post-infarction ACE inhibitor therapy.",1,0

Full data available for 74 patients from 107 consecutive living-associated donor kidney transplants between June 1991 and March 1993 were entered into the proforma and analyzed. Patients were divided into 6 categories according to whether antihypertensive drugs were prescribed or not. Group I patients who did not use antihypertensives were taken as controls. All patients were comparable in terms of age, gender, weight, immunosuppressive therapy, anesthetic and fluid management during surgery. Patients who received atenolol (plasma K+ levels 5.34 +/-0.75 mmol/l in group II and 5.44 +/-0.63 mmol/l in group III) or captopril (serum K+ level 5.05 +/) during induction of anesthesia - Group 0.94 mmol/l in V) in combination with nifedipine and with or without clonidine had significant hyperkalemia relative to the patient without antihypertensives (serum K+ level 4.49 +/-0.71 mmol/l). Patients using these two antihypertensives often required active treatment for alarming hyperkalemia (blood K+ greater than 5 mmol/l and long 'T' wave in lead II) and cardiac arrhythmias. In conclusion, ESRD patients receiving atenolol or captopril need to be monitored frequently for blood potassium levels and it is recommended to avoid these drugs to control hypertension in ESRD patients, especially when kidney transplantation is planned.",0,0

Large survival studies have used higher doses of ACE inhibitors than those commonly used in clinical practice. NET was established to compare the effect of dose on the clinical outcome of ACE inhibition; 1532 patients with heart failure from primary care (n = 619) and hospital resources (n = 913) were randomized to receive enalapril 2.5 mg twice daily (n = 506). 5 mg twice daily (n = 510) or 10 mg twice daily (n = 516). The mean age was 70 years and 65% were male. Coronary heart disease was the cause of heart failure in 71%. Sixty-five percent were in NYHA class II and 35% were in class III or IV. The mean left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 59 (SD 11) mm.

The primary objective of the Fosinopril Versus Amlodipine Randomized Study of Cardiovascular Events (FACET) was to compare the effects of fosinopril and amlodipine on serum lipids and diabetes control in NIDDM patients with hypertension. Prospectively defined cardiovascular events were considered secondary outcomes; Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of NIDDM and hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg). Exclusion criteria included a history of coronary heart disease or stroke, serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl, albuminuria > 40 microgram/min, and use of lipid-lowering drugs, aspirin, or antihypertensive agents other than beta-blockers or diuretics. A total of 380 hypertensive diabetic patients randomly assigned to open-label fosinopril (20 mg/day) or amlodipine (10 mg/day) were followed for up to 3.5 years. If blood pressure cannot be controlled, other study drug was added; Both treatments were effective in lowering blood pressure. At the end of follow-up, there was no significant difference in total serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, HbA1c, fasting serum glucose or plasma insulin between the two groups.

Both delta GFR (P = 0.01) and progression to ESRF (P = 0.01) differed significantly even between the middle and highest tertiles. In contrast, classification in the quintiles of baseline MAP failed to categorize patient subgroups into different risk levels. Patients with the highest proteinuria and blood pressure showed the fastest progression (delta GFR, 0.91 +/- 0.23; ESRF 34.7%). Interestingly, at all levels of baseline MAP, a higher proteinuria was associated with a faster delta GFR and progression to ESRF. On the other hand, at each level of proteinuria, a faster delta GFR was associated with MAP only at the highest tertile (>112 mm Hg), and the risk of ESRF was independent of MAP. Thus, proteinuria in chronic nephropathies is the best independent predictor of both disease progression and ESRF. Arterial hypertension may contribute to the acceleration of kidney damage associated with increased trafficking of plasma proteins. Antihypertensive drugs that most effectively limit protein trafficking at comparable blood pressure levels are those that most effectively slow disease progression and delay or prevent ESRF in proteinuric chronic nephropathy.",0,0

2360,9577953,Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.,,"Brown, N J; Vaughan, D E","ACE inhibitors have gained widespread use in the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases. ACE inhibitors alter the balance between the vasoconstrictive, salt-retaining and hypertrophic properties of angiotensin II (Ang II) and the vasodilatory and natriuretic properties of bradykinin and alter the metabolism of a number of other vasoactive substances. ACE inhibitors differ in the chemical structure of their active moieties, potency, bioavailability, plasma half-life, route of elimination, distribution and tissue-related ACE affinity, and whether they are administered as prodrugs. Therefore, the side effects of ACE inhibitors can be divided into those that are class-specific and those related to certain agents. ACE inhibitors reduce systemic vascular resistance and promote natriuresis without increasing heart rate. They have been proven effective in the treatment of hypertension, reduce mortality in congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, and delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

The maximum reduction in diastolic blood pressure (placebo-corrected) after imidapril was 22 mmHg after the first dose and 25 mmHg at steady state. Exploratory analysis of imidaprilat plasma concentration versus effect profiles suggests a hyperbolic concentration-effect relationship in which single dose data contribute to the ascending portion of an Emax curve, whereas the plateau around Emax is kept at steady state.

Quinapril reduced carotid and brachial pulse pressure equally, causing pulse pressure amplification to reset to normal values. Carotid compliance and resilience and aortic resilience were significantly increased. Based on the three-way analysis of variance, it was shown that while changes in carotid stiffness were due to lower blood pressure alone and not to drug-induced relaxation of the arterial wall, changes in aortic extensibility were due to the combination. from both factors. Therefore, using an atraumatic non-invasive procedure, it was possible to demonstrate that: (i) ACE inhibition can drive pulse pressure amplification, an important factor contributing to the reduction of cardiac afterload; and (ii) ACE inhibition alters the hypertensive arterial wall in a very heterogeneous manner, with maximal drug action on the large muscular arteries such as the abdominal aorta, but not on elastic arteries such as the carotid artery and thoracic aorta.",0,0

Beijing Collaborative Working Group.,,"Wu, N; Fan, Z","To investigate the effects of beta-blocker (atenolol) and ACE inhibitor (enalapril) for secondary prevention of major cardiac complications after acute myocardial infarction (AMI); 1106 AMI cases were collected from 7 hospitals in the Beijing area and randomly divided into three groups: control (group C), atenolol (group A), and enalapril (group E). Drugs for the study were administered 2-4 weeks after the onset of AMI and subjects were followed for a median period of 19 months. All patients were given 50 mg/day aspirin. The endpoints of observation were cardiac events and non-cardiac events. Cardiac events include sudden cardiac death (SCD), heart failure death, total cardiac deaths, and myocardial re-infarction; The clinical conditions of the three groups were compatible. Sixty-six cardiac events (6.0%) occurred. Compared with group C, the rate of SCD was significantly reduced by 68% in group A after 28 months of atenolol treatment. Both atenolol and enalapril significantly increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), whereas in group C, LVEF was unchanged during the follow-up period. There was a clear trend towards a decrease in the survival curve in group C compared to the other two groups. Purely drugs reduce one cardiac death 0/00/month. However, the rate of myocardial re-infarction was the same in the three groups. No serious adverse effects on blood pressure or heart rate were observed.; Both atenolol and enalapril (home products) are useful in secondary prevention of SCD and heart failure death after AMI, but not for re-infarction.

Treatment with spironolactone has been reported to be beneficial in severe congestive heart failure (CHF) when combined with loop diuretics and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. However, the effects of spironolactone supplementation on exercise capacity and neurohormonal variables have not been demonstrated. This study determined the effects of additive spironolactone on exercise capacity and neurohormonal factors in patients with mild CHF. 2. Oxygen uptake (VO2), plasma norepinephrine (NE), renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II (AII), aldosterone (ALD), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were measured at rest and after peak exercise. CHF (six idiopathic and three ischemic cardiomyopathy; New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II and III) currently receiving furosemide (mean 29 +/- 5 mg/day) and enalapril (mean 4.7 +/- 0.8 mg/day). Studies were repeated after 16 weeks of treatment with a single daily dose of 25 mg of spironolactone. In four of the nine patients, the exercise test was repeated after a 4-week washout of spironolactone. 3. Treatment with spironolactone resulted in natriuresis, decreased cardiothoracic ratio on chest x-ray (pre- and post-treatment: 53.7 +/- 1.2 vs 50.7 +/- 1.4, P < 0.01), and improvement of NYHA functional class. Peak VO2 (17.1 +/- 1.6 vs. 17.5 +/- 2.2 ml/min/kg, NS) and heart rate and blood pressure responses to exercise were unchanged.

ALD and AII were insignificantly increased at peak exercise and ANP was insignificantly reduced after spironolactone treatment. Spironolactone washout was associated with a tendency for neurohormones to return to pretreatment values. 4. In conclusion, chronic additive therapy with spironolactone has been associated with neurohormonal activation, both at rest and during exercise, without altering the exercise capacity of patients with mild CHF currently on loop diuretics and ACE inhibitor therapy.",0,0

Given the strong association between LV hypertrophy and cardiovascular risk, this study was designed to compare the effect of treatment with a diuretic and ACE inhibitor on cardiovascular structure. Fifty essential hypertensives (74% male, 88% non-white) participated in a double-blind study for 6 months and were randomized to ramipril or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Echocardiography, carotid ultrasonography, and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring were performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after initiation of therapy. The 22 ramipril patients were comparable to 28 baseline HCTZ patients in terms of age, race, and 24-hour BP. Although HCTZ resulted in a greater reduction in 24-hour BP, treatment with ramipril alone did not result in a reduction in LV mass (193 to 179 g, P < .005, v 184 to 182 g, P = NS), attributable to a reduction. resulted in a decrease. wall thicknesses, but not room-wide. In multivariate analysis, both the change in BP and the treatment group were independent predictors of change in LV mass. Importantly, although no drug decreased the carotid artery cross-sectional area, the relative wall thickness increased due to the tendency for vessel diameter to decrease and wall thickness to increase, particularly in the diuretic group. Ramipril caused a sustained decrease in plasma angiotensin II, while HCTZ increased angiotensin II levels. Although diuretic therapy was more effective in lowering ambulatory blood pressure in this predominantly non-white population, treatment with ACE inhibition alone was associated with regression of LV mass.

Moexipril administration of 7.5 or 15 mg once daily effectively lowers blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension (including the elderly and postmenopausal women with this condition). In double-blind, randomized comparative studies, moexipril 7.5 to 15 mg once daily has demonstrated similar efficacy to other antihypertensive agents, including captopril, hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, metoprolol, sustained-release verapamil and nitrendipine. Combined therapy with hydrochlorothiazide and moexipril had a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either agent alone. Moexipril is well tolerated by the majority of patients and compares well with other antihypertensive agents in this respect. The tolerability profile appears to be characteristic of ACE inhibitors as a class (the most common side effects are headache, upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and cough). Moexipril had no clinically relevant effects on lipid, glucose, or electrolyte metabolism or hematological parameters in general, and was not associated with any significant changes in lipid or glucose metabolism, particularly in postmenopausal women (with or without hormone replacement therapy); Moexipril once daily is a useful agent for the treatment of essential hypertension and compares well with currently available options in terms of clinical efficacy and tolerability.

The absolute benefit was particularly large in some high-risk groups (ie, Killip class 2 to 3, heart rate > or = 100 bpm at entry) and anterior MI. ACE inhibitor therapy also reduced the incidence of non-fatal heart failure (15.2% versus 14.6%, 2P=0.01), but excessive persistent hypotension (17.6% versus 9.3%, 2P<0.01) and renal dysfunction (1.3%). against 1.3%. 0.6%, 2P<0.01); These results support the use of ACE inhibitors in the early treatment of acute MI in a wide range of patients or selectively in patients with anterior MI and those at high risk of death.",0,0

Systemic inhibition of NEP does not consistently lower blood pressure, although it increases natriuretic peptide concentrations and causes natriuresis and diuresis. Therefore, we investigated the direct effects of local inhibition of NEP on forearm resistance vascular tone; Four separate studies were conducted, each involving 90-minute drug infusions. In the first study, 10 healthy subjects received a brachial artery infusion of the NEP inhibitor candoxatrilat (125 nmol/min), resulting in a slowly progressive forearm vasoconstriction (12±2%; P=0.001). In a second biphasic study, 6 healthy subjects received an intra-arterial infusion of the NEP inhibitor thiorphan (30 nmol/min) 4 hours after enalapril (20 mg) or placebo. Thiorphan caused similar degrees of local forearm vasoconstriction (P=0.6) after pretreatment with both placebo (13%+/-%1, P=0.006) and enalapril (17%+/-6%, P=0.05). In a third triphase study, 8 healthy subjects received intra-arterial thiorphan (30 nmol/min), the endothelin ETA antagonist BQ-123 (100 nmol/min) and both. Thiorphan caused local forearm vasoconstriction (13+/-1%, P=0.0001); BQ-123 caused local vasodilation (33+/-3%, P=0.0001). Combined thiorphan and BQ-123 induced vasodilation similar to BQ-123 alone (32+/-1%, P=0.0001) (P=0.98). In a fourth study, 6 hypertensive patients (blood pressure >160/100 mm Hg) received intra-arterial thiorphan (30 nmol/min). Thiorphan induced a slowly progressive forearm vasoconstriction (10%+/-2%, P=0.0001).; Inhibition of local NEP causes vasoconstriction in the forearm resistance vessels of both healthy volunteers and patients with hypertension. The lack of effect of ACE inhibition on the vasoconstriction produced by thiorphan, and not during concomitant ETA receptor blockade, suggests that it is mediated by endothelin-1, not angiotensin II.

It is a 1-year prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, comparative study. Patients aged 25 to 75 years with high diastolic blood pressure (> or = 95 mmHg) and untreated hypertension on three occasions (twice at the first visit and only once at the second and third visit) were recruited from a population survey. After 4 weeks of placebo infusion, 71 patients were randomized to dosages of 5-10 mg amlodipine or 10-20 mg lisinopril, titrated for effects on blood pressure. Fifty-nine patients completed the study period. Primary endpoints were left ventricular mass index and early to atrial peak filling rate. Office and ambulatory blood pressure and other echocardiographic measurements were considered secondary. The reduction in blood pressure was equal for both treatment regimens. A statistically significant reduction in left ventricular mass index was observed in both treatment groups: -11.0 g/m2 (95% CI: -6.0, -16.1) and -12.6 g/m2 (95% CI: -8.2,) in the amlodipine group. -17.0) in the lisinopril group.

ACE inhibitors have been reported to be superior to many other antihypertensive drugs in inducing a regression in LVH. In a double-blind study with parallel groups, 50 patients with essential hypertension were randomized to either fosinopril (20 mg d) or atenolol (50 mg daily) for 12-16 weeks. Left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT, defined as the sum of the interventricular septum and posterior wall), diastolic function (represented by the ratio between the E wave and the A wave of mitral blood flow), and femoral artery blood flow (FBF) were measured. evaluated using ultrasonic measurements. FBF was measured in normoinsulinemia and after 2 hours of euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. Before treatment, the insulin-induced increase in FBF was inversely proportional to LVWT (r = -0.52, p < 0.02). The reduction in ambulatory 24-hour SBP/DBP was 13/9 mmHg for fosinopril and 15/14 for atenolol, with ambulatory DBP significantly more reduced by atenolol (p = 0.03 for difference in treatment effect). However, fosinopril treatment alone resulted in a significant reduction in LVWT (20.5 mm to 19.4 mm, p < 0.05). The degree of decrease in LVWT was associated with an increase in FBF in the fosinopril group (r = -0.45, p < 0.05). For fosinopril (but not atenolol), there was a positive correlation between change in E/A ratio and change in femoral artery stroke volume (r = 0.80, p < 0.01). Impaired insulin-induced stimulation of leg blood flow was associated with increased LVWT. Furthermore, during fosinopril treatment, regression of LVWT was associated with increased skeletal muscle blood flow during hyperinsulinemia. This indicates that impaired peripheral blood flow (and thus increased afterload) may be a possible mechanism explaining the preexisting association between insulin resistance and cardiovascular hypertrophy.",0,0

Both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been reported to increase vagal modulation of heart rate and baroreflex sensitivity, but the relationships between the antihypertensive and vagal cardiac effects of these drugs in essential hypertension remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the effects of 4-week cross monotherapy with metoprolol and ramipril on the spectrum analysis indices of heart rate variability in supine resting and head-up tilted positions, baroreflex sensitivity (phenylephrine method), and 24-hour outpatient treatment. Blood pressure (BP) in 12 previously untreated grade 1-2 essential hypertensive patients. Compared with pre-treatment values, both drugs reduced BP similarly and significantly. However, the drugs showed differential effects on cardiac vagal activity: metoprolol significantly increased mean RR interval, total RR interval, and high-frequency variability and baroreflex sensitivity at supine rest, but ramipril did not significantly affect these variables. Metoprolol-induced reduction in ambulatory BP correlated with prolongation of the RR interval and increased high-frequency variability at supine rest. Available data suggest that 4 weeks of treatment with metoprolol increases tonic and reflex vagal cardiac activity, whereas ramipril does not affect vagal cardiac control in essential hypertension. The increase in vagal activity may contribute to the blood pressure lowering effect of metoprolol in hypertensive patients.",0,0

Blood pressures (BPs) were adequately controlled with CCBs. None had overt proteinuria (determined by Albustix) or abnormal serum creatinine levels. After 3 months of baseline observation under previous treatment, subjects were randomly divided into two groups. In group A (n = 31), previously used CCBs were switched to temocapril 2 to 4 mg once daily for 12 months and blood pressure was controlled at a level equivalent to that during CCB treatment.

Various pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models were compared. We evaluated the strength of the association between the baseline physiological and laboratory variables and the BP response, as assessed directly from the AUC(0.10 h) and indirectly from the slope of the PK/PD relationship. Prediction models for response variables were developed using regression analysis; The BP response was primarily related to plasma drug concentration. The relationship between the decrease in BP and the underlying variables was weak. The strongest single predictor of BP response was mean arterial pressure at baseline (r2 = 5.8%, P = 0.02). The best combinations of predictive variables included mean arterial pressure, plasma renin activity, creatinine concentration, and age (r2 = 14.4%, P = 0.37). Adding ACE inhibitor selection increased the predictive power of the model (r = 23.6%, P < 0.01) but could not explain much of the variability in response; The first dose blood pressure response to ACE inhibition cannot be accurately predicted from key pathophysiological variables in patients with mild to moderate CHF.

2405,9671045,Acute hyponatremic encephalopathy after a cerebrovascular accident.,,"Moussa, N A; Osman, A R; Yahya, T M","66-year-old hypertensive male patient with acute intracerebral hemorrhage developed acute hyponatremic coma 3 days after adding a combination of enalapril and amiloride and a thiazide diuretic to his hypotensive regimen. The patient's consciousness improved and serum sodium returned to normal 2 days after fluid restriction and discontinuation of both drugs. Three weeks later, upon accidental reintroduction of enalapril and indapamide, severe hyponatremic encephalopathy promptly recurred; Recovery was rapid again after fluid restriction and discontinuation of both drugs. This temporal relationship establishes a thiazide diuretic or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or both, as the cause of profound symptomatic hyponatremia in this patient. The results of simultaneous serum and urine osmolality experiments in several situations were consistent with a decrease in free water clearance and thiazide-induced natriuresis as a result of increased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion or potentiation of its peripheral action. The use of a thiazide diuretic in the presence of any of these abnormalities of ADH homeostasis most likely explains the profound and rapid development of hyponatremia. Drug-induced disturbances in serum osmolality are a potentially reversible cause of mental status deterioration in a patient with acute cerebrovascular accident.",0,0

The aim of this study was to determine whether antihypertensive drug therapy improves impaired endothelium-dependent renal vasorelaxation in essential hypertensive patients without atherosclerosis. We evaluated the effects of intravenous L-arginine infusion (500 mg/kg given over 30 minutes) on systemic and renal hemodynamics in 27 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension randomly assigned to therapy with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor imidapril. or the calcium antagonist amlodipine for 12 weeks in a double-blind manner. After 12 weeks, the decrease in blood pressure was similar in the imidapril (n=14) and amlodipine (n=13) groups. The increase in renal plasma flow was also similar in both groups. L-Arginine-induced renovascular relaxation, imidapril (renal plasma flow, 9.6%+/-5.1% to 14.4±7.4%; renal vascular resistance, -10.4+/-8.1 to -16, 7±9.2, P<0.05, respectively) but not with amlodipine. Urinary nitrite/nitrate excretion in response to L-arginine was significantly increased with imidapril (90±29% vs 134±63%, P<0.05) but remained unchanged with amlodipine. These findings suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition improves impaired endothelium-dependent renovascular relaxation in patients with essential hypertension due to increased nitric oxide production, and that reduction in blood pressure by a calcium antagonist does not play a significant role in potentiation.

Although the literature on reduction of LV mass with antihypertensive therapy is extensive, little is known about the effects of therapy on left atrial size; Patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 109 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to treatment with atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, hydrochlorothiazide, or prazosin in a double mask study. Two-dimensional targeted M-mode echocardiography was used to evaluate left atrial size and LV mass at baseline, 8 weeks, and 1 and 2 years. Longitudinal analysis examined changes in left atrial size from baseline study by statistically adjusting for age, race, pretreatment left atrial size and LV mass, and serial measures of systolic blood pressure, body weight, urinary sodium excretion, and physical activity score. Without adjustment for covariates, hydrochlorothiazide alone was associated with a reduction in left atrial size at week 8 (-1.0 +/- 5.2 mm; P=0.052) at 1 year (-2.0 +/- 5.1 mm; P=0.02). has been associated. and 2 years (4.6+/-7.2 mm; P=0.002). After adjusting for the effects of covariates, patients with normal left atrial size had a greater reduction in left atrial size (-3.3 mm) at 2 years with hydrochlorothiazide than with other drugs. In patients with left atrial enlargement, left atrial size was significantly reduced at year 1 with hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, clonidine, and diltiazem and at year 2 for all treatments. However, the reduction at 2 years was greater with hydrochlorothiazide than with captopril or prazosin; Antihypertensive drugs differ in their effects on left atrial size. Hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with a greater overall reduction in left atrial size than other drugs effective in the treatment of hypertension. Left atrial size reduction with treatment is independent of known factors known to partially affect left atrial size, including LV mass and reduction of LV mass with treatment. The clinical benefit of reducing left atrial size with antihypertensive therapy has not yet been established.",0,0

Arterial baroreflex control of heart rate was evaluated with phenylephrine bolus. Arterial baroreflex test was re-examined 3 hours after oral alacepril (37.5 mg). Tilt and arterial baroreflex tests were repeated 12 weeks after alacepril treatment (50 mg x day(-1)); Heart rate, blood pressure, and neurohormonal factors did not differ before and after chronic alacepril, except for a trend for increased renin activity (2.0 vs 4.9 ng x ml(-1) xh(-1)). Head-up tilt reduced central venous pressure (-2.5 mmHg) with a reduction in cardiac dimensions in the pre-alacepril phase. These changes were accompanied by increases in noradrenaline, adrenaline, and angiotensin II and a decrease in atrial natriuretic peptide. After chronic alasepril, the increase in noradrenaline during head-up tilt tended to be smaller (84 vs 30 pg x ml(-1)) and similar changes in central venous pressure (-3.4 mmHg) and cardiac dimensions. Both acute (3.6 vs 4.8 ms mmHg(-1)) and chronic (3.6 vs 6.7 ms mmHg(-1)) alacepril treatment was associated with a trend towards an increase in arterial baroreflex control of heart rate; These results suggest that treatment with alasepril may result in decreased sympathetic activation during orthostatic stress and improve arterial baroreflex function in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.",0,0

It is the largest database of its kind in the world, with around 35,000 new reports added quarterly. The task of trying to find new drug-ADR signals was undertaken by an expert panel, but with such a large volume of material the task is daunting. We have developed a flexible, automated procedure to find new signals with known probability difference from background data; Data mining using various computational approaches is applied in various disciplines. A Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) has been developed that can handle large datasets, is robust in handling missing data, and can be used with complex variables. Using information theory, such a tool is ideal for finding drug-ADR combinations with the generality of the stored data or other variables that are highly correlated compared to a fraction of the stored data. The method is transparent for easy control and flexible for different call types; Using BCPNN, some time-screening examples are given, demonstrating the technique's power to detect signals early (captopril-cough) and avoid false positives when a common drug and ADRs occur in the database (digoxin-acne; digoxin-rash). . A routine application of the BCPNN to a quarterly update was also tested, showing that 1004 suspected drug-ADR combinations achieved a confidence level of 97.5% from generality. Of these, 307 were potentially serious ADRs, and 53 of these were related to new drugs. Twelve of these were not recorded in CD editions of The Doctor's Desk Reference or Martindale's Extra Pharmacopoea, and were not featured online in Reactions Weekly. The results show that BCPNN can be used to detect important signals from the WHO International Drug Monitoring Program dataset. BCPNN would be an extremely useful addition to the expert assessment of numerous self-reported ADRs.",0,0

Also, for total (P = .009) and cardiovascular (P = .09) mortality, the benefit of antihypertensive drug therapy weakened with increasing age; for overall mortality (P = .05), the benefit increased with higher systolic BP at entry, whereas for fatal and non-fatal stroke (P = .01), the benefit was greatest in non-smokers (92.5% of all patients).

2415,9704248,Comparative tolerability profile of hypertensive crisis treatments.,,"Grossman, E; Ironi, A N; Messerli, F H","hypertensive crisis is defined as a severe elevation in BP and is classified as urgency or urgency. There is no end-organ damage in hypertensive urgency and there is no evidence that acute BP lowering is beneficial. Indeed, rapid uncontrolled pressure drop can be harmful. Therefore, in hypertensive emergencies, BP should be gradually lowered over 24 to 48 hours using oral antihypertensives. Appropriate treatment should be given when the cause of transient BP elevations is easily identified. Oral antihypertensives should be given when the cause is unknown. The efficacy of current treatments appears to be similar; however, the underlying pathophysiological and clinical findings, mechanism of action and potential for side effects should guide the selection. Captopril should be avoided in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or in patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis in patients with solitary kidneys. Nifedipine and other dihydropyridines increase heart rate, while clonidine, beta-blockers and labetalol tend to decrease heart rate. This is especially important in patients with ischemic heart disease. Labetalol and beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with bronchospasm and bradycardia or heart blocks. Clonidine should be avoided if mental acuity is desired. In a hypertensive emergency, there is an immediate threat to the integrity of the cardiovascular system. Blood pressure should be lowered immediately to prevent further end-organ damage. Sodium nitroprusside is the most popular agent. Nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) is preferred when there is acute coronary insufficiency. In some patients, beta-blockers can be added. Loop diuretics, nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside are effective in patients with concomitant pulmonary edema. Enalaprilat is also theoretically useful, especially when the renin system is activated. Initial treatment of aortic dissection includes rapid, controlled titration of arterial pressure to normal levels using intravenous sodium nitroprusside and a beta-blocker. If beta-blockers are contraindicated, urapidil or trimethaphane camsilate are alternatives. Hydralazine is the drug of choice for patients with eclampsia. If hydralazine fails or is contraindicated, labetalol, urapidil, or calcium antagonists are possible alternatives. For patients with catecholamine-induced crises, an alpha-blocker such as phentolamine should be given; beta-blockers and labetalol or sodium nitroprusside are alternatives. There are few, if any, comparative or randomized studies that give firm conclusions about the efficacy and safety of comparative agents. Some researchers recommend lowering diastolic blood pressure below 100 to 110 mm Hg. A reasonable approach for most patients with hypertensive emergencies is to reduce mean arterial pressure by 25% in the first 2 to 4 hours with the most specific antihypertensive regimen.",0,0

2423,9725973,Acute pancreatitis following treatment with lisinopril.,,"Gershon, T; Olshaker, J S","Acute pancreatitis has many causes, the most common being biliary tract disease and alcoholism. Other etiologic categories are abdominal trauma; postoperative, including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; metabolic, including hypercalcemia and hypertriglyceridemia; contagious; idiopathic; and drug related. The drugs most strongly associated with pancreatitis are sulfonamides, thiazides, furosemide, estrogens and tetracycline. About 100 cases of pancreatitis induced by an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor have been reported to the US Food and Drug Administration, of which about 20 contain lisinopril. We present a case of pancreatitis that occurred only 3 hours after ingestion of lisinopril by a man with no other risk factors for the disease. The patient experienced a similar but less severe reaction to this drug 3 months ago. This case probably represents the first time a patient was restarted on lisinopril and had a more significant adverse reaction.",0,0

The EURODIAB Controlled Trial of Lisinopril in IDDM was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 530 non-hypertensive, mostly normoalbuminuric IDDM patients aged 20-59 years. Albumin excretion rate (AER) was measured every 6 months for 2 years. The genotype distribution was 15% II, 58% ID and 27% DD. There were no differences between genotypes in baseline characteristics or changes in blood pressure and glycemic control throughout the trial. There was a significant interaction between II and DD genotype groups and treatment on change in AER (P = 0.05). Patients with the II genotype showed the fastest rate of AER progression on placebo but more responsive to lisinopril. AER (adjusted for baseline AER) at 2 years was 51.3% lower (95% CI, 15.7 to 71.8; P = 0.01) on lisinopril than placebo in II genotype patients versus 14.8% (-7.8 to 32.7%; P) in the ID group. = 0.2) and 7.7% in the DD group (-36.6 to 37.6; P = 0.7).

Negative interactions between aspirin and enalapril have been reported, possibly through aspirin inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis induced by an ACE inhibitor. Ticlopidine is a potent antiplatelet agent that does not interfere with prostaglandin synthesis; The aim of this study was to compare the effect of co-administration of ticlopidine or aspirin on the hemodynamic effects of an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) in patients with chronic heart failure. Twenty patients with severe heart failure were enrolled in a double-blind comparative study and allocated to ticlopidine (500 mg daily, 12 patients) or aspirin (325 mg daily, 8 patients). After 7 days of treatment, hemodynamic evaluation was performed every hour for 4 hours after oral administration of 10 mg of enalapril. In contrast to the absence of a significant reduction in the aspirin group, significant reductions in systemic vascular resistance were observed in the ticlopidine group. A significant (P=0.03) duration interaction with respect to treatment indicated a significant aspirin-enalapril drug interaction. Total pulmonary resistance was significantly reduced in both groups, with no difference between patients given aspirin or ticlopidine; Enalapril reduced systemic vascular resistance more effectively when given in combination with ticlopidine compared to aspirin. In contrast, the reduction in total pulmonary resistance was similar when enalapril was administered in combination with aspirin or ticlopidine. Negative aspirin-enalapril interaction on prostaglandin synthesis likely alters systemic vasodilation, while prostaglandin-independent ACE inhibitory effects such as pulmonary arterial vasodilation are preserved.",0,0

More patients in the captopril group than the atenolol group received the assigned therapy: 78% of those assigned captopril and 65% of those assigned atenolol were receiving the medication at their last clinical visit (P<0.0001). Captopril and atenolol were equally effective in reducing the risk of the macrovascular endpoint. Similar proportions of patients in the two groups showed two grades of deterioration in retinopathy after nine years (31% in the captopril group and 37% in the atenolol group) and developed clinical grade albuminuria >=300 mg/l (5% and 9%). The proportion of patients with hypoglycemic episodes was not different between groups, but the mean weight gain was greater in the atenolol group (3.4 kg vs 1.6 kg); Lowering blood pressure with captopril or atenolol was similarly effective in reducing the incidence of diabetic complications.

Consideration was given to the use of resources guided by the trial protocol and the use of resources in standard clinical practice. 20 hospital-based clinics in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland; From the UK prospective diabetes study, 1148 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to tight control of blood pressure (n=758) or less stringent control (n=390); Cost-effectiveness rates are based on (a) use of health resources associated with tighter control and treatment of complications, and (b) life years gained in trial period independent of diabetes-related endpoints. Based on the use of resources driven by the trial protocol, the increased cost-effectiveness of tight control resulted in cost savings compared to less tight control. Based on the use of resources in standard clinical practice, the incremental cost per extra year independent of endpoints was £1049 (costs and effects 6% discounted per year) and £434 (costs 6% per year discounted and effects not discounted). The incremental cost per life year gained was £720 (costs and effects discounted 6% per year) and £291 (costs discounted 6% per year and effects not discounted); Tight control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes significantly reduced the cost of complications, prolonged complication-free time and survival, and had a cost-effectiveness rate that compares favorably with many accepted health programs.",0,0

However, difficulties in measuring quinine concentrations have so far precluded the demonstration of an indisputable change in plasma bradykinin concentrations in these disorders. By developing a reliable assay, we were able to monitor bradykinin concentrations in HA and AA, as well as during attacks and during remission in a patient treated with an ACE inhibitor; Liquid phase extraction, high performance liquid chromatography and RIA were used for specific measurement of plasma bradykinin concentrations in 22 patients with HA and 22 healthy volunteers with similar age and sex distribution. Four patients with AA and one hypertensive patient treated with the ACE inhibitor captopril were also studied; Among healthy volunteers, plasma bradykinin concentration was inversely proportional to age. The geometric mean plasma bradykinin concentration in healthy volunteers was 2.2 fmol/mL (SD 2.2) during remission compared to 3.9 fmol/mL (3.7) in patients with HA during remission (p=0.095). Bradykinin was also elevated in patients with AA (10.4 fmol/mL [1,6]). During episodes of acute edema in both HA and AA, plasma bradykinin increased from two to 12 times the upper limit of normal. Infusion of C1-esterase inhibitor (missing factor in both HA and AA) immediately reduced bradykinin concentrations. In the patient receiving the ACE inhibitor captopril, the bradykinin concentration was very high at 47 fmol/mL during an acute attack of angioedema, but was normal at 3.2 fmol/mL in remission after drug discontinuation; A sensitive method for measuring plasma bradykinin provided the tools to show that concentrations of this peptide decrease with age in healthy humans.

The study included a 3-week washout pretreatment period, a 12-month treatment period with lisinopril once daily (n=84) or lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide (n=91), and a 4-week follow-up period on placebo. Results of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and echocardiographic determination of left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were obtained before and after 3 and 12 months of treatment.

Mean 24-hour blood pressure decreased similarly at 3 and 12 months. The lowest blood pressure changes at 3 and 12 months and the corresponding peak blood pressure changes are closely related. However, T/Ps at 3 and 12 months correlated to a lesser degree (r<0.42). In addition, treatment-induced LVMI reduction was similarly correlated with treatment-induced reduction in 24-hour mean, trough and peak blood pressures, but not with T/Ps. This was also evident when 24-hour blood pressure changes and the contribution of T/Ps to LV hypertrophy regression were evaluated in a multivariate regression analysis. LVMI regression was similar in patients with T/P >/=0.5 or <0.5. As a result, peak and trough blood pressure changes are reproducible and predict treatment-induced regression of LVMI as well as mean 24-hour blood pressure. T/Ps are less reproducible and their values do not predict regression of organ damage with antihypertensive therapy.",0,0

After a 3-week placebo period, patients were treated with trandolapril 2 to 4 mg daily for 16 weeks. BAE and blood pressure (mercury sphygmomanometer and 24-hour ABPM) were measured at baseline and repeated on trandolapril. Predictive factors of abnormal BAE (24-h BAE > or = 30 mg) were determined using univariate and multivariate analysis (logistic regression). UAE decline estimates were also explored. One hundred and seventy-one patients entered the analysis. Baseline office BP was 164+/-14 / 97+/-6 mm Hg and 24-hour BP was 142+/-17 / 83+/-10 mm Hg. Seventy-four (43%) patients had BAE > or = 30 mg. Independent risk factors for abnormal BAE were nocturnal diastolic BP (odds ratio [OR] = 4.1, confidence interval [CI] = 2.0 to 8.6, P = .0001), duration of diabetes (OR = 2.4, CI = 1.1 to 5.0, P = .025) and presence of retinopathy (OR = 3.2, CI = 1.0 to 10.0, P = .047). Conversely, office BP level was not significantly correlated with UAE. At treatment, office BP levels decrease to 143+/-13 / 82+/-8 mm Hg (P < .0001) and 24-hour BP levels to 134+/-17 / 78+/-9 mm Hg (P < . 0001) fell. .0001). In the abnormal UAE group, the UAE significantly decreased from 76 mg/day to 50 mg/day (P = .006). After treatment, the independent predictors of abnormal BAE were: fasting plasma glucose (OR = 3.5, CI = 1.7 to 7.4, P = .0009) with medication and nocturnal diastolic BP (OR = 3.5, CI = 1.7 to 7.4) with medication, P = .001). The only predictor of decrease in UAE was 24-hour systolic blood pressure decrease (OR = 2.3, CI = 1.3 to 4.3, P = .007). We conclude that in diabetic hypertensives with abnormal BAE, trandolapril exerts a sustained 24-hour antihypertensive effect and produces a consistent reduction in microalbuminuria. This study confirmed the superiority of ABPM over clinical BP in predicting target organ damage.",0,0

Therefore, we conducted such a study in patients with non-diabetic kidney disease and proteinuria. After a 4-week washout period in which patients were not using any medication known to affect proteinuria, 21 patients were treated with either the calcium channel blocker amlodipine (Amlo, 5 to 10 mg) or the ACE inhibitor lisinopril (Lis, 5 to 10 mg). During the 16-week study period, blood pressure, creatinine clearances, and proteinuria were measured every 2 weeks. In addition, device-measured blood pressure and renal hemodynamic studies were performed at the beginning and end of the study. Systolic blood pressure ranged from 163+/-7 (SEM) to 140+/-8 mm Hg (P < .01) in the Lis group and from 157+/-10 to 147+/-6 mm Hg in the Amlo group fell ; diastolic blood pressure decreased from 101+/-3 to 86+/-7 mm Hg in the Lis group and from 98+/-3 to 91+/-2 mm Hg in the Amlo group. Renal hemodynamics were not affected by amlodipine treatment, whereas a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was seen in patients treated with lisinopril (55+/-11 to 50+/-10 mL/min; P < .01). Amlodipine did not significantly affect proteinuria. Lisinopril caused a decrease in the protein-creatinine ratio (0.39 ± 0.17 to 0.26 +/-0.11 g/mmol; P < .009) with the maximum effect achieved after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment. In conclusion, we could not demonstrate the antiproteinuric effect of the long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine, whereas treatment with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril caused a reduction in proteinuria. While amlodipine did not affect renal hemodynamics, lisinopril caused a decrease in GFR.",0,0

A fixed low-dose combination of these two agents has been proposed for the treatment of hypertension. We evaluated this combination in 26 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and mild to severe chronic renal failure not requiring dialysis. This was a multicenter, open trial consisting of a 2-week single-blind placebo washout period followed by 12 weeks of active treatment. At week 0, patients were given perindopril 2 mg/0.625 mg indapamide once daily or every other day, and there was a possibility of dose adjustment to perindopril 4 mg/indapamide 1.25 mg at week 2, week 4, or week 8. A pharmacokinetic analysis was performed at week 8 using a population pharmacokinetic approach. Twenty-three patients completed the 12-week study; meanwhile, 14 patients received 2 mg perindopril/0.625 mg indapamide per day, and three patients received 2 mg perindopril/0.625 mg indapamide per day, one after the other. day and six perindopril 4 mg/indapamide 1.25 mg. Blood pressure readings (supine) decreased from 170.4+/-19.2 / 101.5+/-6.7 mm Hg before active therapy to 146.5+/-19.7 / 86.5+/-10.6 mm Hg at the end of therapy (P < .0001). Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC24) for indapamide and perindoprilat (the active metabolite of perindopril) increased with the severity of renal impairment. No interaction was noted between the two drugs. Mean serum creatinine and sodium and serum potassium levels remained constant throughout the study. Renal dysfunction occurred in one patient and was considered unrelated to the treatment. We conclude that the fixed low-dose perindopril-indapamide combination has a good safety/efficacy ratio as first-line therapy in hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure.",0,0

In chronic heart failure, the renin-angiotensin system is activated. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improves symptoms and prognosis. The aim of this study was to measure and localize skeletal muscle ACE-mRNA and elucidate skeletal muscle fiber area and capillary density in patients with chronic heart failure and control subjects; Biopsies of the lateral vastus muscle were obtained from 9 patients and 10 control subjects before and after treatment with enalapril. ACE-mRNA was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize ACE in skeletal muscle. No differences in ACE-mRNA transcripts were detected between patients and control subjects, and ACE gene expression was unchanged after treatment with enalapril. While the number of ACE-mRNA transcripts was related to muscle fiber area, an inverse relationship was found between the number of ACE transcripts and capillary density. ACE was detected in endothelial cells of capillaries in skeletal muscle; ACE is expressed in skeletal muscle and is limited to endothelial cells. The close relationship between capillary density and the number of ACE transcripts suggests that activation of the renin-angiotensin system has an effect on capillary growth.",0,0

The patients were hospitalized and no controls were made. They were randomly matched on the basis of concurrent eligibility for Medicaid benefits. The odds ratios for hospitalization in patients exposed to known drug-drug interactions were compared with those in patients exposed to one of the interacting agents. When the confidence intervals did not overlap, the odds ratio was considered to increase significantly. Odds rates increased significantly for many interacting drug pairs and were associated with less commonly recognized interactions as well as widely recognized interactions. Cimetidine interactions became meaningful only with theophylline. In the Medicaid population, exposure to a number of drug-drug interactions significantly increased the risk of hospitalization.",0,0

Twenty-three middle-aged untreated hypertensive patients underwent evaluation of EDV and endothelium-independent vasodilation (EIDV) in the forearm via local intra-arterial infusions of methacholine (MCh, assessing EDV) and sodium-nitroprusside (SNP, assessing EIDV). ), before and 1 hour after captopril (25 mg) or nifedipine (10 mg) ingestion in a random, double-blind fashion. A matched normotensive control group was studied only at baseline conditions. Five of the hypertensives were also evaluated in an open pilot study after 3 months of treatment with captopril 25 mg twice daily. First, vasodilation induced by methacholine (MCh), not SNP, was significantly reduced in hypertensive patients compared to normotensive controls (P < 0.001 at MCh 4 μg/min). Second, although the two drugs caused a similar decrease in blood pressure (BP) 1 hour after administration (-11 to 10 mm Hg/-8 to 7 mm Hg), captopril significantly enhanced the vasodilator response to MCh (+32+/- 13%, MCh 4 μg/min, P < 0.01) but not SNP, whereas nifedipine did not significantly alter the response to MCh or SNP. The improvement in the vasodilator response to MCh induced by captopril was closely associated with the reduction in BP (r = 0.72, P < 0.01). Third, in the pilot study, 3 months of captopril treatment induced a significant potentiation of the vasodilator response to MCh (+34+/-17%, MCh 4 µg/min, P < 0.05) in parallel with a significant BP reduction (- 22+/- 24/13+/-13 mm Hg, P < 0.05), response to SNP was unchanged. In conclusion, this study confirmed that essential hypertension is associated with a defect in EDV. Also, an improvement in EDV was seen shortly after administration of captopril in hypertensive patients, but not nifedipine. In addition, a small pilot study during long-term treatment with captopril showed a significant beneficial effect on EDV.",0,0
2445,9759987,The direct cost to the NHS of cutting and changing prescriptions for hypertension.,,"Hughes, D; McGuire, A","There is ample evidence that hypertension treatment reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and is cost-effective in most patients. However, the effectiveness of treatment depends on adherence and maintenance to treatment. Each pharmacological agent differs in terms of side effects. The presence of side effects can lead to a lack of compliance and switching between treatments. A number of studies have reported high dropout rates for anti-hypertensive treatments. This poses a potential cost to health care. The aim of this study is to use the MEDIPLUS dataset to consider the cost of changing and discontinuing therapy. The analysis will assess resource costs in terms of extra GP visits and hospitalizations resulting from individuals switching and discontinuing treatments. The total cost of hypertension has been estimated at around £76.5 million per year, of which £26.9 million is attributable to patients switching or discontinuing treatment.",0,0

A total of 5268 patients (64% with a history of hypertension or baseline BP above 95 mm Hg [diastolic] or 160 mm Hg [systolic]) were randomly assigned to active therapy or placebo. After 6 months of follow-up, the BP difference between the treatment and control groups was 10.2/4.5 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). Sixty-three strokes (two fatalities) and 20 myocardial infarctions (four fatalities) were recorded; With almost 90% of the 6,000 patients enrolled in the study, the applicability of the study is now assured. ACE therapy with perindopril is well tolerated in the population studied. The BP differences between the control and treatment groups and the event rates recorded to date indicate that the study will achieve its primary goals.",0,0

No patient had received a previous antihypertensive agent before the start of this study. After a 2-week control period, we performed ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in 86 patients with essential hypertension (WHO stage I or II). Patients were then given a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) (captopril or imidapril), a beta-receptor blocker (arotinolol or bisoprolol), or a calcium channel blocker (nisoldipine or benidipine) twice daily to control BP. We evaluated the patients' blood pressure every 2 weeks to ensure optimal control. After 12 weeks, ultradian and circadian variations in BP were analyzed by the maximum entropy method (MEM). All antihypertensive agents reduced office systolic BP (SBP), office diastolic BP (DBP), 24-hour SBP, and 24-hour DBP. ACEI office did not change the pulse rate (PR) around the clock, day or night. Arotinolol and bisoprolol decreased 24-hour PR. All antihypertensive agents reduced the 24-hour, day and night pressure ratio product. MEM showed that no antihypertensive agents affected the circadian variation in the 1st peak (24 hour periodicity) of SBP, DBP, or PR. However, calcium channel blockers shortened the periodicity of circadian variations in the 2nd peak of SBP (12 hour periodicity) and 3rd peak of SBP (8 to 6 hour periodicity). Therefore, ultradian variations in BP should be carefully monitored in hypertensive patients treated with calcium channel blockers.",0,0

Factors possibly responsible for the large inter-patient variance of antiproteinuric effect (APE) have not yet been investigated in kidney transplant patients; 28 patients with persistent proteinuria greater than 1.25 g/day after RTx were prospectively treated with doses of fosinopril (10-15 mg/day) that had no effect on systemic arterial blood pressure. Renal graft biopsy was performed in all patients before fosinopril was started, and renal graft artery stenosis was excluded by duplex ultrasound. Mean arterial pressure was checked for serum creatinine and proteinuria, 3 and 8 months after the initiation of ACE inhibition, as well as 24-hour measurement and repeated point measurements. Decreased proteinuria correlates with renal histology, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, mean arterial blood pressure, sodium excretion before treatment, and relative changes of these parameters during treatment, respectively; Treatment had to be stopped in 8/28 patients due to side effects such as increased serum creatinine (n=4). Three patients were excluded due to non-compliance. In the remaining patients (n = 17), proteinuria was reduced from 2.94 +/- 1.66 to 1.82 +/- 1.39 and 2.48 +/- 3.05 g/day at mean +/- SD at 3 and 8 months, respectively. There was a significant inverse correlation between APE and the extent of benign nephrosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. Correlation of APE with any of the other parameters could not be demonstrated; Fosinopril can be effectively administered to a subset of proteinuric kidney transplant recipients. However, due to the high proportion of patients who develop side effects, careful follow-up is mandatory. Our results show that the lower the degree of chronic morphological damage, the greater the antiproteinuric effect. Therefore, the degree of pre-existing histologically proven damage to the graft may serve as an indicator of the antiproteinuric efficacy of ACE inhibitor therapy after RTx.",0,0

At the end of the core study, patients continued or switched to ramipril and were formally enrolled in the REIN follow-up study. 97 patients entered the follow-up study. Patients initially randomized to ramipril continued with the same daily dose (n=51), while patients initially receiving placebo plus conventional antihypertensive drugs were switched to ramipril after the first visit of the follow-up study (n=46). Ramipril (1.25 to 5.00 mg/day) and conventional antihypertensive therapy aimed to achieve diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. The main efficacy variables were GFR reduction and ESRF (need for dialysis). The analysis was therapeutic; During the follow-up study, the mean GFR reduction rate per month decreased from 0.44 (SD 0.54) mL/min per 1.73 m2 in the core study to 0.10 per 1.73 m2 (0.50 mL/min) in patients initially randomized to ramipril (p = 0.017 ) and 0.81 (1.12) to 0.14 (0.87) mL/min per 1.73 m2 in those originally randomized to placebo plus conventional antihypertensive therapy (p=0.017). At the last visit, mean absolute GFR values were 12 mL/min per 1.73 m2 higher in patients randomized to ramipril than in those given placebo (n=26 and 17: 35.5 [19.0] vs. 23.8 [9.4], respectively). 33% better) ] mL/min, 1.73 m2, p=0.01).

Beyond follow-up at 36 months, the incidence of ESRF was zero in patients initially randomized to ramipril, but 30% in patients receiving placebo plus conventional antihypertensive therapy; In patients with chronic nephropathy and at high risk of rapid progression to ESRF, ramipril reversed the trend of decreasing GFR over time. In addition, an adequate duration of treatment (> or =36 months) eliminated the need for dialysis.

The mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors and AII antagonists ameliorate EC are still unclear. We tested the hypothesis that improvement in EC is related to changes in skeletal muscle composition towards type I fibers; Eight patients with congestive heart failure, NYHA class I to IV, were treated with enalapril (E) 20 mg/day for 6 months and 8 other patients with losartan (L) 50 mg/day. EC was assessed with a maximum cardiopulmonary exercise test at baseline and after treatment. The myosin heavy chain (MHC) composition of the gastrocnemius was investigated after electrophoretic separation of slow MHC1, fast oxidative MHC2a and fast glycolytic MHC2b isoforms from needle microbiopsies obtained at baseline and 6 months later.

These changes are accompanied by a re-shift of MHCs of leg skeletal muscle towards slow, more fatigue-resistant isoforms. The magnitude of MHC1 changes correlates with the net peak V(O2) gain, suggesting that enhanced EC may result from appropriate biochemical changes occurring in skeletal muscle.",0,0

Patients were using digoxin, furosemide, captopril and aspirin for more than 3 months. Thirteen healthy subjects (mean age, 50 +/- 4.0 years) served as controls. The alignment of the proximal (aorta and its major branches, C1) and distal portions (C2) of the circulation is derived from the third-order four-element modified Windkessel model, which can reproduce arterial pressure waveforms including both exponential and oscillating segments. Active renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels were determined in venous blood samples in the supine position and after 30 minutes of active standing. Proximal (C1, 1.51 +/- 0.11 ml x mmHg(-1), P<0.01) and distal (C2, 0.050 +/- 0.011 ml x mmHg(-1)) arterial compliance were decreased in chronic heart failure patients. versus controls (C1, 1.71 +/- 0.16 ml x mmHg(-1); C2, 0.054 +/- 0.006 ml x mmHg(-1)).

2467,9793603,Losartan as an alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients with impaired renal function.,,"Esmail, Z N; Loewen, P S","Losartan-induced acute renal failure may occur in patients sensitive to decreased renal plasma flow. Such patients include patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis, severe congestive heart failure, and severe sodium and volume depletion, as their kidney function is often angiotensin-dependent. Theoretically, both ACE inhibitors and losartan may impair kidney function in such sensitive patients. The ELITE study showed a 10.5% incidence of losartan-induced renal dysfunction in elderly patients with congestive heart failure and no underlying renal dysfunction, the same incidence as with captopril. A review of the literature revealed that there were no controlled studies specifically addressing whether losartan could be used as an alternative in patients with losartan-related renal dysfunction, and an additional case report from a local adverse drug reaction monitoring program was identified. There were two cases of patients who developed renal dysfunction while taking ACE inhibitors followed by losartan. We found only one published case of using losartan without impaired renal function in patients who developed renal dysfunction while taking an ACE inhibitor, but underreporting of such cases can be expected. There has been one case of renal dysfunction with losartan after the patient was not impaired while taking an ACE inhibitor. The remaining three reports are of patients who developed renal dysfunction while taking losartan without prior ACE inhibitor use. All case reports describe renal impairment that is reversible on discontinuation of the triggering agent, whether an ACE inhibitor or losartan. All but two patients (personal interview, Barbara Cadario) had underlying renal pathology. Although the published literature is scarce and some clinical experience suggests otherwise, there is currently no evidence (other than one case report) that losartan is better tolerated than ACE inhibitors in terms of renal toxicity. Current evidence suggests that this is equally true in patients with and without underlying renal dysfunction. In addition, case reports suggest that, as with ACE inhibitors, losartan should be avoided in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis and in patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis of the solitary kidney. In patients with underlying renal dysfunction, regardless of whether they tolerate ACE inhibitors, losartan can be used if deemed necessary. Renal function should be monitored and losartan should be discontinued if evidence of renal dysfunction becomes evident, as several case reports and a randomized trial suggest that losartan may cause the same adverse renal effects as ACE inhibitors.",0,0

Patients received placebo or candesartan cilexetil 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg once daily for 8 weeks. All doses of candesartan cilexetil significantly reduced sitting diastolic and systolic BP compared to placebo (24 hours after treatment). Significant (p < or = 0.0001) dose response was evident, with greater reductions in BP at higher doses. Mean changes in BP were -10.7/-7.8 mm Hg and -12.6/-10.2 mm Hg in the 16- and 32-mg groups, respectively, compared to -0.3/-2.6 mm Hg in the placebo group. The 16 and 32 mg doses were consistently significantly superior to placebo in antihypertensive effect for all BP measures, including diastolic and systolic BP, peak, sitting and standing measures. The proportions of responders (sitting diastolic BP < 90 or > or = 10 mm Hg BP reduction) were 54% and 64% for the 16 and 32 mg groups, respectively. Tolerability and safety profiles were similar to placebo at all doses. In conclusion, once-daily candesartan cilexetil effectively reduces blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner while maintaining safety and tolerability; Doses of 16 and 32 mg are most effective for the treatment of hypertension.",0,0

The effects of nitrendipine compared with enalapril and enalapril compared with placebo were similarly described. Left ventricular mass was measured by M-mode echocardiography; The use of nitrendipine and enalapril resulted in significant and almost identical reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Over 48 weeks, the left ventricular mass index decreased by 5% for patients in the nitrendipine group (12 g/m2 reduction, 95% confidence interval 1-23), remaining approximately the same for patients in the enalapril group (1 g/m2 reduction m2 for patients in the placebo group. From 10 to 95% confidence interval decreases 9 increases 9 and increases 9% (9 g/m2 increase, 95% confidence interval 2-16); these results demonstrate that administration of nitrendipine to patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension reduces left ventricular mass index. Enalapril does not appear to cause regression, but inhibits progression, perhaps with an effect intermediate between nitrendipine and placebo.",0,0

Doxazosin and captopril used for 6 months in hypertensive type-1 diabetic patients were equally effective in reducing blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy; the antihypertensive effect is closely related to glycemic control; and dietary sodium intake and post-treatment transient blood pressure are independent predictors of the reduction in left ventricular mass seen in these patients.",0,0

Compared with placebo (n=1180), active treatment (n=1238) reduced the incidence of dementia by 50% from 7.7 to 3.8 per 1000 patient-years (21 vs. 11 patients, p=0.05) . The median MMSE score at randomization was 29 in both treatment groups. At the last available assessment, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 8.3 mm Hg and 3.8 mm Hg lower, respectively, in the active treatment group (p<0.001), but on average the MMSE scores were unchanged in both groups. However, in the control patients, the MMSE decreased with the reduction of diastolic blood pressure (p=0.04), whereas the MMSE scores in the active treatment group improved slightly (p=0.01) with a greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure (p=0.002). -group difference); In elderly people with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive therapy has been associated with a lower incidence of dementia. If 1000 hypertensive patients were treated with antihypertensive drugs for 5 years, 19 cases of dementia could have been prevented.",0,0

Depending on the patient's other cardiovascular risk factors and the presence of clinical cardiovascular disease, antihypertensive drug therapy may be initiated after lifestyle changes have been attempted or soon after diagnosis. In general, treatment in patients under 65 years of age may be initiated with diuretics or beta-adrenergic blockers, unless a concomitant condition warrants another, more specific choice. Initially, low doses should be used, but if blood pressure cannot be successfully reduced to 140/90 mm Hg or less, another drug should be added or superseded by first choice. General principles of treatment include the use of once-daily formulations and combination drugs, as well as cost considerations.",0,0

A possible association of the use of calcium channel blockers with cancer incidence and cancer mortality was discussed using data from the Nurses' Health Study. In this study, a total of 18,635 female nurses reported regularly taking at least one of 4 cardiovascular drugs in 1988: diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and/or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Cancer incidence and cancer deaths were determined until 1994; During the 6-year follow-up, 852 women were newly diagnosed with cancer and 335 women died of cancer. Women who reported using calcium channel blockers had no increased risk of newly diagnosed cancer compared to those taking other cardiovascular drugs (relative risk=1.02; 95% CI 0.83-1.26). The relative risk of dying from cancer associated with self-reported use of calcium channel blockers was 1.25 (95% CI 0.91-1.72). Relative risks were adjusted for the following self-reported factors: age; weight; height; cholesterol level; systolic and diastolic blood pressure; to smoke; alcohol intake; physical activity; menopausal status; postmenopausal hormone use; use of aspirin; and a history of diabetes, cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, angina, and hypertension. Regarding site-specific cancer incidence and mortality, only lung cancer incidence slightly increased (RR=1.61; 95% CI 0.88-2.96); These data show no significant increase in overall cancer incidence or cancer mortality due to self-reported use of calcium channel blockers.",0,0

The effects of dihydropyridine CCB on 24-hour urinary protein excretion rate and GFR reduction (deltaGFR) were prospectively evaluated in 117 nondiabetic patients with chronic, proteinuric nephropathy enrolled in the Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy study and randomized to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI). or placebo plus conventional antihypertensive therapy. Sixty-three percent of patients were treated with dihydropyridine CCB. At follow-up, CCB-treated patients had higher proteinuria compared with patients without CCB (mean+/-SEM: 4.8±0.2 g/24 hours and 4.2±0.2 g/24 hours, respectively, P = 0.015) and mean arterial BP (MAP). The difference in proteinuria was significant in the placebo group (5.1+/-0.2 g/24 hours vs. 4.3+/-0.3 g/24 hours, P = 0.02), but not in the ACEI group (4.4+/-0.2 g/24 hours vs. 4.1+/- 0.2 g/24 hours). Of note, CCB-treated patients had significantly less proteinuria (P = 0.028) in the ACEI group compared to placebo. Compared to patients treated with CCB, patients without CCB had faster deltaGFR in the general study population and in the placebo group, but not in the Ramipril group. Proteinuria was comparable for MAP < or = 100 mmHg in CCB-treated and non-CCB-treated patients, but higher for MAP >100 mmHg in CCB-treated patients. Similarly, proteinuria was comparable in the placebo and ACEI group for MAP < or = 100 mmHg, but was higher in the placebo group for MAP >100 mmHg. A linear correlation (P = 0.006 for both groups) was found between proteinuria and MAP values in patients treated with CCB and placebo. MAP, proteinuria, and deltaGFR were similar in patients given nifedipine compared to those given other dihydropyridine CCB. Thus, in non-diabetic proteinuric nephropathies, dihydropyridine CCB may have an adverse effect on renal protein utilization depending on the severity of hypertension and is minimized by ACEI therapy or tight BP control. ACE inhibitors may selectively limit proteinuria in patients receiving dihydropyridine CCB therapy and/or uncontrolled hypertension.",0,0

Therefore, recent attention has focused on calcium antagonists or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. While these agents lower blood pressure, outcome data from large randomized trials are lacking, but some case-control data dominated by short-acting dihydropyridines suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular events. These studies had methodological limitations and did not differentiate between calcium antagonist types and formulations. The few studies distinguishing between types of calcium antagonists and a summary of published randomized trials show no increased risk with verapamil and no suggestion of benefit in patients with CAD; A total of 27,000 CAD patients with hypertension will be randomized to 1,500 primary care centers to receive a calcium antagonist-based (verapamil) or beta-blocker/diuretic-based (atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide) antihypertensive care strategy. The study uses a new electronic ""paperless"" system for screen data entry, randomization and drug delivery directly from a postal pharmacy connected to the coordination center via the Internet; Contract negotiations with the United States and international sites continue. Enrolled patients were predominantly elderly (72% 60 years or older) men (54%) who had an abnormal coronary angiogram or previous MI (71%). In addition to hypertension, CAD, and elderly age, most patients (89%) have one or more associated conditions (diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, cerebral or peripheral vascular disease, etc.) that contribute to an increased risk of adverse outcomes. While 26% have diabetes, most of them are not insulin dependent. Using protocol strategies, target blood pressure (based on JNC VI) was achieved at 58% at visit four, and most (89%) required more than one antihypertensive medication, as expected; The design and key features of the first patients enrolled in a prospective, randomized, international, multicenter study comparing two therapeutic strategies for controlling hypertension in patients with CAD are described.",0,0

In this study, we report the effect of the angiothesin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on hematocrit (Ht) and erythropoietin in four patients with PTE. Four renal allograft recipients with Ht above 51% were studied. Treatment was started with enalapril at a dose of 2.5 mg/day orally.

All patients responded to enalapril at 8 weeks with a significant reduction in Hb, Ht, and RBC. In one patient, the downward trend was more rapid and sustained and treatment had to be discontinued to prevent the development of anemia. Serum erythropoietin showed normal in all four patients and remained unchanged during the study even after discontinuation of enalapril therapy. Serum creatinine remained relatively stable throughout the study. These results suggest that PTE may not be dependent on circulating erythropoietin and that enalapril therapy may be an effective treatment of PTE without renal dysfunction.",0,0

This may be related to a defect in tubular reabsorption. It is well known that converting enzyme inhibition reduces microalbuminuria and can prevent or delay diabetic nephropathy. We investigated whether enalapril also ameliorated the defect in calcium and phosphate reabsorption. We studied 16 children and young adults (12–21 years) with IDDM and persistent microalbuminuria before and during 12 weeks of enalapril therapy. Pre-treatment microalbuminuria, urinary calcium excretion, and fractional tubular phosphorus reabsorption (TPR) were 153 ± 53 microg/min, 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/kg per day, and 71.4%+/-3.6%, respectively. At the end of the 12th week, microalbuminuria decreased to 20.3+/-7.9 microg/min and calcium excretion decreased to 3.3+/-0.4 mg/kg/day (P<0.01), while TPR increased to 80.1+/-3.8. % (NS).

Various agents (excluding angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) have been used to treat patients with NMS. It is unknown whether ACE inhibitors have beneficial effects on NMS; Thirty subjects with reproducible NMS induced by the head-up tilt table test (HUT) were randomly assigned and double-blindly divided into placebo and enalapril (an ACE inhibitor). Hemodynamics and plasma catecholamine concentrations were studied. Prior to administration of enalapril, syncope induced by HUT was associated with severe hypotension and bradycardia. Plasma catecholamine concentrations were significantly elevated during NMS compared to the supine position before bending. Oral enalapril rather than placebo produced a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure during supine positioning before bending. Enalapril administration prevented HUT-induced NMS and increased plasma catecholamine concentrations in all patients studied. Conversely, placebo had no effect in most patients with NMS (12 out of 15). Follow-up data showed resolution of NMS in 14 (93%) of 15 enalapril-treated patients; This study shows that ACE inhibitors can effectively prevent NMS, possibly through inhibition of sympathetic system activation and peripheral hypotensive effect.",0,0

Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction <40% have a significantly increased risk of transmyocardial laser revascularization. Late deaths (n = 9) were due to sudden arrhythmias or pump failure.

Dependent variables were VO2 peak (VO2peak), ventilator anaerobic threshold (VAT), and VE/VCO2 ratio measured at 30 W and 75% VO2peak; VO2peak and VAT did not differ as a result of the procedure (CAP vs PLC; p = 0.92 and 0.80) or over time (T1 vs T2 vs T3; p = 0.51 and 0.07) . VE/VCO2 was significantly lower for CAP at 30 W (p = 0.05) and, although lower at 75% VO2peak, did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.22). Differences between groups were greater in T2 and T3 compared to T1; CAP resulted in a reduced VE/VCO2 ratio during submaximal exercise. Reduced ventilation may allow patients to perform normal activities of daily living with a lower perceived difficulty, reduce symptoms, and provide a better quality of life.",0,0

We present a case of simultaneous onset of small bowel and orofacial angioedema due to captopril. A 61-year-old black man with hypertension, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure had been treated with captopril for 5 years. He had sudden swelling of his lips, face, and tongue, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Other drugs include aspirin, indomethacin, allopurinol, colchicine, and nifedipine. Examination revealed swelling of the tongue, buccal mucosa and neck; there was also mid-abdominal tenderness but no respiratory distress. Laboratory data were normal. C1-esterase inhibitor level was normal. An ileus pattern was present in the abdominal X-ray. Angioedema was diagnosed and all signs and symptoms resolved 24 hours after captopril was discontinued.

In total, 56 patients were included in the main study, 4 refused to participate in the substudy, and 4 were excluded for logistical reasons. Echocardiography was performed at admission and 6 months later. Patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting during the follow-up period were excluded from the study. At baseline, patients had moderate LV dysfunction and mean AV plane displacement of 9.7 mm. During follow-up, AV plane displacement increased from 9.5 to 10.9 mm in ramipril-treated patients (p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant change in the placebo group; Ramipril improves LV systolic function in patients with clinical signs of heart failure and only moderate systolic dysfunction after AMI.

2499,9829158,Candesartan cilexetil. A review of its use in essential hypertension.,,"McClellan, K J; Goa, K L","Candesartan cilexetil is completely converted to the non-peptide angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan selectively blocks and gradually dissociates the angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptor, which mediates most of the known activities of angiotensin II. When administered once daily, oral candesartan cilexetil 8 to 32 mg dose-dependently and effectively lowers blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. In comparative studies, candesartan cilexetil 8 mg daily was as effective as usual therapeutic doses of enalapril, losartan potassium, hydrochlorothiazide, and amlodipine. One study showed that candesartan cilexetil 16 mg/day was more effective than 50 mg/day losartan potassium. In addition, the combination of candesartan cilexetil with hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine resulted in additive antihypertensive effects. Preliminary evidence suggests that the blood pressure lowering effects of candesartan cilexetil are associated with prevention or amelioration of end-organ damage in patients with hypertension. However, this requires further validation in clinical trials. Candesartan cilexetil improves insulin sensitivity in patients with hypertension and does not affect glucose homeostasis or serum lipid profile in patients with co-existing type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Candesartan cilexetil is well tolerated in patients with hypertension. Collected data indicate that the tolerability profile of the drug is not significantly different from placebo and that headache is the most frequently reported event. Adverse events are not dose related and are mostly mild to moderate. Candesartan cilexetil is better tolerated than enalapril mainly due to a reduced incidence of cough and is not associated with the hypokalaemia or hyperuricemia seen with hydrochlorothiazide in patients > or = 75 years of age. The drug has a side-effect profile similar to that of losartan potassium in patients with mild to moderate hypertension; Once daily candesartan cilexetil is effective and well tolerated when used once daily (as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents) in patients with mild, moderate or severe hypertension. However, initially the drug is likely to be used as an alternative to other agents in patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to current drug therapy.",0,0
2500,9829159,trandolapril. An update of its pharmacology and therapeutic use in cardiovascular disorders.,,"Peters, D C; Noble, S; Plosker, G L","Trandolapril is an orally administered angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used in the treatment of patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF) and after myocardial infarction (MI). Trandolapril is a non-sulphhydryl prodrug that is hydrolyzed to the active diacid trandolapril. Trandolapril 2 mg once daily provides effective control of blood pressure (BP) over 24 hours in patients with mild to moderate hypertension with a trough/peak ratio of blood pressure (determined by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring) consistently > or = 50% . Trandolapril has similar antihypertensive efficacy to enalapril, as noted in several clinical trials. Combined therapy with trandolapril and sustained-release verapamil has a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either agent alone. Only limited data are available on the use of trandolapril in patients with CHF, but ACE inhibitors are recommended as a class of first-line therapy in such patients. In the Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study, trandolapril 1 to 4 mg once daily resulted in an early and long-term reduction in all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular mortality, in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after MI. Trandolapril treatment was started on average 4.5 days after acute MI and continued for 24 to 50 months. At study end, the relative risk of death from any cause was 0.78 (p = 0.001) with trandolapril versus placebo. The tolerability profile of trandolapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Most adverse events are mild and transient and include cough, asthenia, dizziness, headache and nausea. Trandolapril has no adverse effects on lipid or carbohydrate metabolism; Trandolapril has a favorable pharmacological profile and antihypertensive activity at least comparable to that of other ACE inhibitors. The pharmacological properties of trandolapril allow good 24-hour control of BP with once-daily administration. Trandolapril has also shown some efficacy in a small number of patients with CHF. In addition, trandolapril provides long-term protection against all-cause death in patients with LV dysfunction after MI. The results of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition (PEACE) study by Prevention of Events will determine its potential as a cardioprotective agent in patients with coronary artery disease and preserved LV function. Therefore, trandolapril represents an effective, well-tolerated, and appropriate treatment option for patients with mild to moderate hypertension or LV systolic dysfunction after MI.",0,0

After a loading phase with lisinopril and a placebo washout phase, patients were randomly assigned to receive losartan 50 mg once daily, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, or placebo for a maximum of 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the presence or absence of dry cough during the double masked period, as rated at each visit by the patient using a validated symptom assessment questionnaire. A secondary endpoint was the frequency of dry cough as measured using a visual analog scale (VAS) at each visit. The incidence of dry cough was significantly higher in the lisinopril group than in the losartan and placebo groups at the end of the double mask treatment period (87.5% versus 36.7% and 31.4%, respectively); There was no statistically significant difference between losartan and placebo groups. Mean VAS scores showed that patients treated with lisinopril rated themselves as having a significantly higher frequency of cough than patients treated with losartan or placebo (1.2 vs 1.5, respectively). Again, the difference between losartan and placebo groups was not statistically significant. Otherwise, all treatments were well tolerated and no serious clinical or laboratory adverse events were reported during the double-masked phase of the study. These results showed that the incidence, severity, and frequency of dry cough in patients with a history of ACE inhibitor-induced dry cough were significantly lower in losartan-treated than lisinopril-treated patients, and the incidence, severity, and frequency of dry cough in patients receiving placebo.",0,0

We conducted a 1-year double-blind, double-dummy randomized controlled trial comparing nisoldipine (20-40 mg once daily) to lisinopril (10-20 mg once daily) in 48 hypertensive Type I diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy. For comparison, 22 age-matched normotensive healthy control subjects were included. Measurements were made at baseline and after 1 year of antihypertensive therapy. Minimal vascular resistance and extensibility (rigidity) of resistance vessels in skin and skeletal muscle were measured using the local isotope washout method.3. Mean arterial pressure decreased equally in both groups: nisoldipine, 113+/-2.1 to 105+/-1.6 mmHg (P<0.001); lisinopril, 110+/-2.7 to 101+/-2.1 mmHg (P<0.002) (controls, 88+/-2.2 mmHg; P<0.0001 compared with diabetic patients). Nisoldipine improved the vascular elasticity of the skin from 28±3.3 to 43±3.8 (P<0.005) and the skin minimum vascular resistance from 16.9+/-1.0 to 13.6±0.8 mmHg. reduced to ml-1.min. 100 g (P<0.02). Lisinopril had no significant effect on skin vascular stretchability (40%+/-4.0% and 41%+/--4.4%), but minimal vascular resistance tended to decrease (18.1+/-0.9 to 15.8+/-1.3 mmHg.ml-1 .min.100 g (P=0.09) Nisoldipine significantly increased skin elasticity after 1 year of antihypertensive treatment compared to lisinopril (P=0.05) 10.8+/-0.7 mmHg.ml-1.min.100 g minimum vascular resistance, both differ significantly from values in the diabetic groups (P<0.0001 for all) Skeletal muscle vascular distensibility remained unchanged after 1 year for both nisoldipine (22%+/-3.3% and 19+/-2.7%) and lisinopril (19%+/- 2.1 and 24+/--2.5) but decreased compared to 43+/- control 3.7% (P<0.0001 for diabetics and controls) However, neither nisoldipine nor lisinopril increased minimal vascular resistance or decreased skeletal 5.

Antihypertensive treatment had no significant effect on arteriolar hyalinosis.6. The reduction in systemic blood pressure was the same during 1 year of treatment with nisoldipine or lisinopril. Abnormal arteriolar stiffness was more pronounced in the lisinopril-treated group than in the nisoldipine-treated group, and compared with lisinopril only nisoldipine improved abnormal arteriolar stiffness and minimal vascular resistance in the skin. This suggests that nisoldipine may reverse peripheral skin perfusion and thereby improve local protection against the development of ischemic skin lesions in Type I diabetic patients with clinical diabetic nephropathy.",0,0

After another 4 week washout period, patients switched to the alternative regimen for another 6 weeks. At the end of the placebo and active treatment periods, blood pressure (BP) was measured (with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer, Korotkoff I and V) and insulin sensitivity was evaluated with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. Glucose infusion rate (GIR) and total glucose requirement (TGR) in the last 30 minutes of the clamp were evaluated.; Both lisinopril and losartan significantly reduced SBP (mean 20.2 and 17.2 mmHg, respectively) and DBP (mean 15.2 and 12.3 mmHg, respectively) with no difference between the two treatments.

The ultimate aim of the analyzes presented here was to evaluate how glycemic indices (especially serum glucose, serum insulin, and HbA1c) might have influenced the effects of the two agents on blood pressure control and CVD events. Inclusion criteria included men and women aged > or 40 years with ultrasonographically confirmed carotid atherosclerosis and diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg. Although insulin-dependent diabetic patients were excluded, the three glycemic indexes had wide enough ranges to include patients who could be classified as prediabetic. A total of 883 patients were randomized to receive either the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (CA) isradipine (2.5-5 mg twice daily) or the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg twice daily) and followed up double-blindly for 3 years. .; Both treatment groups achieved comparable control of diastolic blood pressure and there were no statistically significant differences in any of the glycemic indexes, neither at baseline nor at follow-up. However, extreme isradipine events were noted to be clustered among patients with high baseline HbA1c levels who also experienced greater blood pressure reductions during follow-up.

2508,9842405,Long-term effect of converting enzyme inhibition on circadian sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy.,,"Athyros, V G; Didangelos, T P; Karamitsos, D T; Papageorgiou, A A; Boudoulas, H; Kontopoulos, A G","Autonomic nervous system function in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), particularly diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN), shows an abnormal circadian pattern compared to normal subjects; this probably plays an important role in the onset of acute cardiovascular syndromes, which, compared with non-diabetic subjects, exhibit a similar pattern of occurrence with blunting in the late morning and an increase in nocturnal seizures. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril on the circadian heart rate variability (HRV) pattern, which is a reliable index of sympathovagal interactions in patients with definite DAN. Normalized HRV frequency domain indices [high-frequency power (HFP), low-frequency power (LFP), and ratios (LFP/HFP) indicative of sympathovagal balance, reflecting vagal tone reflecting both vagal and sympathetic (predominantly) modulation) were evaluated. On a 24-hour 2-channel electrocardiogram with a solid-state Holter monitor in 60 patients with DAN at baseline and one year after treatment with quinapril (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30). Normal subjects (n = 30) and patients with DM without DAN (n = 30) were used as controls. The baseline circadian variation of fractional normalized power in DAN patients was abolished with significant predominance of LFP over HFP over the entire 24-hour period. After one year of treatment, quinapril increased HFP, decreased LFP, and improved its rates in the morning (07:00 - 15:00) and night (23:00 - 07:00) time intervals, 20% at night time interval (HFP = maximal effect), LFP = -% 8, LFP/HFP = -31; p < 0.05 - baseline and p < 0.001 - one-year placebo) for all comparisons; Quinapril increased HFP and decreased LFP and their ratio, all indicative of decreased sympathetic dominance, with these indices most adversely affected (morning and nighttime) over time in patients with DAN. Since autonomic function is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of acute coronary events, malignant arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death, improving indices of autonomic function at these time intervals in DAN patients may be useful in clinical practice.",0,0

This study compares the effect of ACE inhibition or angiotensin II (AngII) receptor blockade on urinary protein excretion and renal hemodynamics in 20 patients with IgA glomerulonephritis randomized to receive enalapril (20 mg/day) or irbesartan (100 mg/day) for 28 days. in a double-blind study with two parallel groups. This study also evaluated whether adding indomethacin (75 mg twice daily) to each of the two treatments resulted in a stronger antiproteinuric effect. Enalapril alone reduced total protein excretion (61% change from baseline) and fractional clearance of albumin without change in GFR and minor increase in renal plasma flow. In addition, patients randomized to receive the AngII receptor antagonist irbesartan for 28 days had lower proteinuria (55% change from baseline) and fractional clearance of albumin at the end of the treatment period with similar renal hemodynamic changes. An even more significant reduction in urinary proteins and fractional albumin clearance was observed when indomethacin was added to enalapril therapy. In patients given irbesartan, the addition of indomethacin further reduced proteinuria and fractional clearance of albumin. Combination therapy with enalapril or irbesartan and indomethacin did not significantly affect GFR and renal plasma flow compared to baseline. These findings suggest that in patients with IgA glomerulonephritis, the antiproteinuric effect of blocking AngII activity by ACE inhibitors or AngII receptor antagonists is potentiated by indomethacin, an effect that occurs without impaired renal function.",0,0

Beta-receptor blocker therapy was effective in improving clinical status and left ventricular function in patients with heart failure. Similarly, high doses of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with nitrates partially reverse the ventricular remodeling of heart failure; We tested the hypothesis that beta-blocker therapy added to high-dose ACE inhibitor-nitrates would potentiate reversal of heart failure; Thirteen patients with moderate and severe heart failure, aged 52 +/- 8 years, 12 referred for transplantation, with a duration of heart failure of 4.8 +/- 2.2 years, were followed up prospectively for 12 months. Baseline echocardiographic ejection fraction was 19% +/- 8% and presenting the New York Heart Association class was 2.9 +/- 0.7. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and nitrates were increased to a final dose of lisinopril 53 +/- 31 mg/day and isosorbide dinitrate 217 +/- 213 mg/day for 6 months. At 6 months, beta-blocker therapy with atenolol was initiated and titrated to a final dose of 46 +/- 23 mg/day.

The increase in mortality with vesnarinone was attributed to the increase in sudden death presumed to be due to arrhythmia. Quality of life in the 60 mg vesnarinone group improved significantly more than in the placebo group at week 8 (P<0.001) and week 16 (P=0.003) after randomization. The trends in mortality and quality of life measures in the 30 mg vesnarinone group were similar to those in the 60 mg group but not significantly different from those in the placebo group. Agranulocytosis occurred in 1.2 percent of patients given 60 mg of vesnarinone daily and 0.2 percent of those given 30 mg of vesnarinone; Vesnarinone is associated with a dose-related increase in mortality in patients with severe heart failure, possibly related to an increase in deaths from arrhythmia.

Each time, 24-hour blood pressure recording was performed, followed by a clearance to obtain a 3-hour dose-response curve for intravenously infused NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 0.75, 1.5, and 3.0 mg/day, respectively). work was done. kg/h); At the maximum dose, L-NMMA increased dose-dependently mean arterial pressure by 5 +/- 2 mmHg and systemic vascular resistance by 24 +/- 5%, whereas cardiac output decreased (all P < 0.001). Treatment with enalapril and nifedipine reduced blood pressure, while the L-NMMA-induced increase in systemic vascular resistance was potentiated (enalapril: 45 +/- 7% and nifedipine: 46 +/- 8%; both P < 0.01). L-NMMA also dose-dependently reduced renal blood flow by 58% +/- 8% at the maximum dose (P < 0.001), but no drug potentiated these effects; These results suggest that in essential hypertensives, antihypertensive treatment with enalapril or nifedipine increases the nitric oxide dependence of systemic vascular tone, which may play a role in the blood pressure lowering effect of these drugs. However, this phenomenon cannot be observed in the renal circulation, suggesting a differential regulation of endothelium-dependent vasomotion in the hypertensive kidney.",0,0
2535,9894621,Relationship between serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity and plasma plasminogen activator inhibitory activity in patients with recent myocardial infarction.,,"Moriyama, Y; Ogawa, H; Oshima, S; Arai, H; Takazoe, K; Shimomura, H; Hirai, N; Suefuji, H; Soejima, H; Nishiyama, K; Misumi, K; Yasue, H","high level of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) has been shown to increase the risk of myocardial infarction. Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) is the most important physiological inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator in plasma. An elevated PAI level has been reported to be associated with reduced fibrinolytic capacity and is a marker of recurrent coronary thrombosis risk; We measured serum ACE activity and plasma PAI activity in 34 patients with a recent myocardial infarction and evaluated the correlation between these two values by linear regression analysis. We also administered captopril (37.5 mg/day) to 17 of these patients and randomized placebo to 17 others and compared changes in PAI activity and ACE activity in these two groups over a 1-month period; There was a significant correlation between baseline serum ACE activity and plasma PAI activity in patients (r = 0.498, P < 0.01). Captopril-treated patients showed significantly reduced PAI activity (P < 0.01) and a concomitant reduction in ACE activity; These results suggest that elevated ACE activity is associated with impaired fibrinolysis and treatment with an ACE inhibitor improves fibrinolytic function in patients with a recent myocardial infarction. The results also suggest that the renin-angiotensin system is involved in an increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular events when activated, and a reduction in the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction by ACE inhibition.",0,0
2536,9928746,Target organ involvement in hypertensive patients in eastern Sudan.,,"Hussain, A A; Elzubier, A G; Ahmed, M E","Hypertension has become an important cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated the status of blood pressure (BP) control and the pattern of target organ complications in 198 Sudanese patients treated at a teaching hospital in Kassala town, eastern Sudan (mean age 53 years, 76% females). Excellent BP control (BP <140/90 mm Hg) was achieved in 46% of patients. Stage 2 or Stage 3 target organ involvement, especially albuminuria and ischemic heart disease, was detected in one third of the patients. These complications were found to be related to both the severity and duration of hypertension and the frequency of smoking. Factors such as poor adjustment, unfavorable socioeconomic status, obesity and smoking may be the cause of poor blood pressure control and therefore the development of hypertensive complications. We conclude that optimal BP control has not yet been achieved in most hypertensives in Sudan. The causes of this failure must be identified and corrected to prevent hypertensive target organ damage.",0,0

A 2-year, prospective, randomized study was conducted in 51 men with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or =95 and < or =105 mm Hg, stable NIDDM, serum creatinine between 1.6 and 3.0 mg/dl, and persistent UAE > . 300 and <2000 mg/24 hours. After a 3-month pre-observation period in which patients begin a low-protein, low-sodium diet and a subsequent 4-week placebo adjustment period, patients were treated with ramipril 5 mg or nitrendipine 20 mg for 2 random doses. years. Both drugs similarly reduced BP without affecting glucose homeostasis. In the ramipril group, UAE significantly decreased after only 3 months of treatment, whereas in the nitrendipine group, a significant reduction in UAE was observed after only 1 year, albeit less. During the second year, the percentage change in UAE was not statistically different between the two treatments. Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance did not change significantly with either drug. Progression of renal failure, as assessed by the rate of decrease in creatinine clearance over the 2 years of the study, was similar in the ramipril and nitrendipine groups. In conclusion, both ramipril and nitrendipine were associated with a reduction in BAE, although such a reduction was earlier and more pronounced with ramipril. The decline in kidney function did not differ significantly between the two treatments.",0,0
2538,9928753,Improved efficacy with maintained tolerability in the treatment of primary hypertension. Comparison between felodipine-metoprolol combination tablet and enalapril monotherapy. Swedish Multicenter Group.,,"Andersson, O K","In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel group study, 120 outpatients with mild to moderate primary hypertension were randomized to the felodipine-metoprolol 5/5 combination after a 4-week single-blind placebo adjustment period. Enalapril 50 mg once daily (Logimax, Mobloc, Astra) or 10 mg once daily. If blood pressure (BP) remained under optimal control after 4 weeks (supine diastolic BP >90 mm Hg 24 hours post-dose), the dose was doubled for a further 4 weeks. After 8 weeks, felodipine-metoprolol reduced supine blood pressure significantly more than enalapril (19.7/12.0 mmHg and 11.1/7.2 mmHg, respectively). The mean differences in change in BP between treatments were 8.6/4.8 mm Hg in favor of felodipine-metoprolol (P = 0.001/P <0.001). A statistically significant difference was also observed in standing blood pressure to the advantage of felodipine-metoprolol. Although a greater proportion of patients in the enalapril group (61%) had dose escalation than in the felodipine-metoprolol group (40%), fewer of the enalapril-treated patients achieved adequate blood pressure control (41% versus 63% in the felodipine group). metoprolol, P <0.05). Both treatments were well tolerated. Three patients treated with felodipine-metoprolol and four patients treated with enalapril discontinued treatment due to adverse events. A similar number of patients in each treatment group reported adverse events. In conclusion, a 5/50-10/100 mg once-daily felodipine-metoprolol combination tablet reduced BP more effectively than 10-20 mg once-daily enalapril 24 hours post-dose. The outcome was expected, but a more important observation was that both treatments were tolerated to a similar degree. Obviously, a significant BP reduction can be well tolerated, as is the main objective to show in this study.",0,0

Treatment was initiated with a response-dependent 3-step dose titration period. All patients were started in dose step 1 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 120/0.5 mg once daily) and titrated to dose step 2 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/1 mg od) at 4-week intervals if not normalized (DBP <90 mm Hg). was done. ) to step 3 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 mg od) during the first 12 weeks. All patients who did not normalize after 3 months of treatment were excluded from further participation in the study. The total duration of the treatment period was 6 months. Routine safety studies were performed before, during, and at the end of the treatment period. Verapamil SR/trandolapril was highly effective in lowering blood pressure. At the individual last visit during active treatment (including non-responders), the mean reduction in SBP/DBP was 21.9/17.1 mm Hg (95% CI 19.8-24.1/16.1-18.1 mm Hg), most of which however occurred during the first 3 months of treatment. incoming reduction. After 6 months, 81.9% of enrolled patients showed normalization in DBP (<90 mm Hg) and 85% responded (normalization and/or reduction in DBP of at least 10 mm Hg). Normalization and response rates were comparable when stratified by age subgroups (63-69, 70-79, and > or =80 years), and all were greater than 80%. Verapamil SR/trandolapril was very well tolerated and there was no evidence of any clinically significant changes in routine laboratory safety variables or resting ECG. In conclusion, the fixed dose combination of verapamil SR/trandolapril is an effective and safe alternative therapy for the elderly hypertensive patient.",0,0

(1.5 x 10(6) U for 30 to 60 minutes). Trial therapy was stopped 48 hours before angiography at 3 weeks to determine regional wall motion and infarct arterial flow; There was no difference in ejection fractions or end-systolic volumes between patients randomized to receive captopril and patients randomized to placebo. Among patients with anterior infarction (n = 216), randomization for captopril resulted in a trend towards fewer hypokinetic chords (40+/-13; 44+/-13 vs; p=0.028) and .2 SD below normal.

2541,9987043,The extent of regional wall motion abnormalities defines patients at risk of extensive left ventricular remodeling: implications for the design of trials after myocardial infarction.,,"Zanolla, L; Marino, P; Golia, G; Anselmi, M; Zardini, P; Borghi, C; Ambrosioni, E","FAMIS (Fosinopril in Acute Myocardial Infarction Study) was a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fosinopril in reducing left ventricular enlargement after acute anterior myocardial infarction. We evaluated echocardiographic examinations performed during the trial to assess the trend of remodeling over time and to assess the role of infarct size in identifying patients at risk for progressive left ventricular enlargement; A complete echocardiographic examination was performed at admission, before discharge, and three months later. Patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery or PTCA underwent an additional examination prior to the procedure. Echocardiograms were analyzed in a central laboratory, and end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes were calculated using the modified Simpson's rule technique. Regional wall motion was assessed using the centerline method, analyzing the left ventricular border along 100 chords perpendicular to the centerline formed in the middle of the end-diastolic and end-systolic contours. A quantitative index of infarct size was then calculated based on the number of chords with fractional shortening less than or equal to 5%; Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume index increased significantly over time (p < 0.0001); as a result, stroke volume increased (p < 0.0001) but ejection fraction remained unchanged. Patients were then divided according to the three-month index of infarct size. For both end-diastolic and end-systolic volume, there were not only higher volumes of larger infarcts, but also a greater increase from baseline to 3 months. Also, larger infarcts had a lower ejection fraction and had greater reductions within three months, while smaller infarcts had higher values and an increase over time. An infarct size index of 25 or greater allowed prospective identification at baseline examination of patients at risk for subsequent left ventricular enlargement; In conclusion, patients at greatest risk for left ventricular enlargement, i.e. patients with larger infarct size, constitute a group worthy of consideration for any therapeutic effort to reduce the remodeling process. These patients may actually benefit from therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing left ventricular remodeling and should be studied in clinical trials.",0,0

2543,9990366,Increased levels of interleukin 5 are associated with the occurrence of eosinophilia in drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome.,,"Choquet-Kastylevsky, G; Intrator, L; Chenal, C; Bocquet, H; Revuz, J; Roujeau, J C","Hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS) refers to severe drug eruption, usually associated with systemic symptoms and eosinophilia. It regulates eosinophil counts with the help of interleukin (IL)-5, IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Increased blood IL-5 levels have been reported in patients with eosinophilia secondary to parasitic infections or idiopathic eosinophilia, but have never been evaluated in drug-induced eosinophilia. The aim of our study was to determine whether IL-5, IL-3 and GM-CSF play a role in eosinophilia in patients with drug-induced HSS. Plasma levels of IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF were tested by ELISA in seven patients with drug-induced HSS, eight patients with unrelated cutaneous adverse drug reactions, and five patients with non-drug-related eosinophilia. . IL-5 levels were normal in all eight patients with drug eruption without eosinophilia and elevated in five of seven patients with HSS. In subsequent patients, IL-5 levels peaked a few days before peak eosinophil counts were recorded and returned to normal within a few days, even if eosinophilia persisted. In patients with eosinophilia unrelated to drug therapy, IL-5 levels increased significantly but remained lower than in HSS patients. IL-3 and GM-CSF were never detected in any group. Our results suggest that IL-5 plays a role in drug-induced eosinophilia. Since IL-5 production is only involved in the early stages of the reaction, it is suggested that IL-5 originates mainly from activated lymphocytes rather than eosinophils. Our results support the clinical relevance of previous in vitro findings. Further studies are needed to test whether assays of IL-5 production by lymphocytes of patients induced by the suspected drug and/or its metabolites are useful in establishing causation in drug-induced reactions associated with eosinophilia.",0,0
